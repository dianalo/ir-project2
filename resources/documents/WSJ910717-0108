Novell, the dominant supplier of software that controlsnetworks of personal computers, opens a new front in itsbattle with Microsoft by acquiring the closely held Monterey,Calif., concern. Digital Research makes a clone ofMicrosoft's DOS, which is the software program that controlsthe basic operations of International Business Machines Corp.personal computers and of IBM-compatible machines.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is a direct attack on Microsoft,&quot; said PhilippeKahn, chief executive officer of software maker BorlandInternational Inc. &quot;Now a customer can buy a networkoperating system from Novell without buying anything fromMicrosoft.&quot;   Ray Noorda, Novell's chief executive, downplayed hiscompany's rivalry with Microsoft, saying he was attracted toDigital Research because its version of DOS is superior toMicrosoft's in some ways. However, he expresssed frustrationover Microsoft's unwillingness to share future product plans,a sore point with Novell because its networking software mustwork smoothly with applications from diverse suppliers.   &quot;We have not been invited to be involved&quot; in Microsoft'sadvanced work, Mr. Noorda complained.   The deal, which the companies expect will be completed byOctober, calls for Novell, which is based in Provo, Utah, toissue 1.5 million new shares in return for Digital Research'sprivate stock. In national over-the-counter tradingyesterday, Novell shares fell $2 to close at $53.   Microsoft's oldest direct competitor, Digital Research hashad an up and down history. The company supplied the firstbroadly available operating software for personal computer,called CPM, in the late 1970s and seemed earmarked to becomea software powerhouse. But Digital Research fell by thewayside when IBM chose Microsoft to supply DOS for Big Blue'soriginal PC -- purportedly partly because Digital Researchfounder Gary Kildall wasn't on hand when IBM's executivescame to call. By the mid-1980s, the company was stagnating,but recently it has posted a modest revival on the strengthof DR-DOS, which is the functional equivalent of Microsoft'sDOS.   In competing with Microsoft, however, Digital Research hasbeen hampered by the failure to offer a version of itssoftware that is compatible with Windows, a popular Microsoftprogram that improves the performance of DOS. The companyalso has failed to sign up any major PC brand as a customer.Digital Research said it had revenue of $40.9 million in itsyear ended Sept. 30.   Under Novell's ownership, Digital Research might pose agreater threat to Microsoft. However, Novell's main interestis in increasing its edge over Microsoft in networkingsoftware, where Novell's Netware product holds a wide leadover a rival product made by Microsoft.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          DIGITAL RESEARCH Inc.'s computer operating system, DR-DOS,is compatible with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows command system,but Digital Research hasn't developed a clone of Windows. Therelationship of DR-DOS to Windows wasn't clearly stated inWednesday's edition.   (WSJ July 22, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
