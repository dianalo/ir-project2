The agency, which proposed a $5,000 fine, said 6,400 square feetof asbestos-containing floor tiles were improperly removed inFebruary from a hallway at Thornton Township High School insuburban Harvey.   Workers who were not accredited by the EPA ``had sanded, chippedand cut the tiles, releasing clouds of dust containing asbestos,''the agency said in a statement.   The district overseeing the school in southwest suburban Harveyfailed to ``post signs and restrict the affected area to only thosepersons necessary to do tile removal and cleanup,'' the EPA said.   School officials have until July 11 to respond to the complaint.They can either seek an informal hearing with EPA officials inChicago or request a hearing before a federal administrative lawjudge, EPA spokeswoman Nancy Sullivan said.   The school was closed Friday afternoon and officials could notbe reached for comment.   Ms. Sullivan said school officials did not know the tilescontained asbestos when the removal began, but suspected they mightand ordered tests.   The EPA called the complaint its first enforcement actionnationwide under last year's Asbestos Hazard Emergency ResponseAct, which specifies procedures for removing asbestos in public andprivate elementary and secondary schools.</TEXT></DOC>
