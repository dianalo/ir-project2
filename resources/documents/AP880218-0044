The report released Wednesday by the Congressional Office ofTechnology Assessment also determined that screening of healthinsurance applicants to detect the AIDS virus is common amonginsurance companies and health maintenance organizations.   The OTA report said that while the number of AIDS cases reportedby various companies ranged up to 3,000, most insurers hadreimbursed no more than 10 AIDS-related cases.   Twelve commercial insurers and three Blue Cross plans reportedthat 10 percent or more of their AIDS-related cases were linkedwith a ``pre-existing condition'' for AIDS.   Two of the 12 commercial insurers reported that more than halftheir AIDS-related claims were based on pre-existing conditions.Almost half the commercial insurers surveyed _ 21 out of 44 _reported no pre-existing AIDS-related cases among their AIDS claims.   Forty-five of the 61 companies surveyed reported having AIDSclaims.   A pre-existing condition is one that exists before an insurancepolicy goes into effect and which would cause an ordinarily prudentperson to seek diagnosis, care or treatment.   The issue is being thrashed out in the courts, the study said.   ``At present, there are several court cases pending relating towhat comprises a pre-existing condition for AIDS and the allegedrefusal by insurer(s) to pay for AIDS-related claims based on apolicy's pre-existing condition provision,'' it said.   OTA said its survey of commercial insurers, Blue Cross and BlueShield plans and HMOs found that most insurers ask AIDS-relatedquestions on applications and require health histories from anapplicant's physician.   The report said 51, or 86 percent, of the 62 commercial insurerswho responded to the survey either screen or plan to screenindividual applicants for infection with the AIDS-causing HIV virus.   Forty-one already do and another 10 plan to start the tests.Eleven of 15 Blue Cross plans surveyed either screen or plan toscreen, as do eight of 16 responding HMOs.   Thirty-one of the 62 commercial carriers said they routinelytest applicants for HIV antibodies, while one of the 15 BlueCross@Blue Shield plans did and two of the HMOs did.   The survey found that there is a difference, however, in howinsurers judge someone to be at risk of AIDS as opposed to being atrisk of contracting other diseases. In addition to evaluatingmedical criteria, 18 of the 62 commercial insurers said theyconsider sexual orientation in determining risk of contractingAIDS, as did four of the 16 HMOs surveyed.   As of Jan. 25, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 51,916Americans, of whom more than half, or 28,965, have died since 1979,according to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. No one isknown to have recovered from AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
