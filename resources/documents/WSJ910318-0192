But it isn't a special issue ofthe magazine. It's a multimedia work on CD-ROM, or compactdisk-read only memory, a technology that combines reams oftext, digital sound and full-color photographs on a five-inchCD, to be played on a personal computer. Bits of &quot;DesertStorm&quot; will be unveiled today in San Jose, Calif., at theannual International Conference and Exposition on Multimediaand CD-ROM.</LP><TEXT>   Though uncertainties and pitfalls abound, Time Warner andother mainstream media businesses see growing promise in theCD-ROM branch of electronic publishing, as do computer,telecommunications and cable-television companies. Usingrecorded music, movies and magazines as their raw materials,such companies as Sony Corp. and Affiliated Publications Inc.-- even the National Geographic Society -- are developingCD-ROM products to be released in coming months for a wideconsumer audience.   Sony plans to unveil a CD-ROM &quot;bundle,&quot; including thecomputer attachment needed to run a multimedia disk, and fiveor six disks containing an encyclopedia, almanac, even aneducational video game. With its distributors keen on keepingSony's business in consumer electronics, the company can putthe disks in a large number of stores.   A CD-ROM boom has been predicted repeatedly since thetechnology was perfected in the mid-1980s, but the field isstill in its pioneering days. Only in recent months have Sonyand Affiliated formed electronic publishing divisions, andmany of the most popular CD-ROM disks are barely a year old.   Cost has been the first barrier to wider acceptance. Toplay CD-ROM disks, PCs must be equipped with $500 disk driveattachments (though the price has dropped from $1,300 in1988). PC makers are starting to ship PCs with built-inCD-ROM drives, but only in limited quantities.   The universe of PC users who have CD-ROM drives remainsrelatively small, so media companies aren't sure how much toinvest. Production costs skyrocket when publishers have topay royalty fees for use of recorded music, free-lancephotographs, or movie clips.   Some media companies fear CD-ROM will prove to be justanother toy for computer buffs. Richard Duncan, a Timemagazine executive editor who organized the &quot;Desert Storm&quot;CD-ROM, hopes to make it riveting stuff for a general user,but admits the disk probably will be bought mainly by &quot;newsfreaks, and techie news freaks at that.&quot;   Publishers are also hesitant because some big mediacompanies, sure they were on the cusp of a CD-ROM explosionin years past, have fizzled in the marketplace. InternationalData Group even launched a magazine, CD-ROM Review, in 1986,but it lasted only 14 issues. &quot;CD-ROM has never grown as fastas other high technologies,&quot; says Kelly Conlin, thepublishing company's director of business development. &quot;It'san elusive market.&quot;   But publishers hope to get a handle on it this year. Thenumber of CD-ROM drives in use is expected to grow to about500,000 in 1991 from 100,000 in 1988, according toInternational Data Group (though that's still just a fractionof the 25 million or more PCs in use). Conference attendanceis another gauge. International Data Group's first CD-ROMExpo in 1987 drew 1,000 attendees; this year's will have morethan 3,000.   So far, the bulk of CD-ROM users have been bigcorporations, universities, government agencies and publiclibraries. But the technology's growing presence in thosesettings may create more consumer users.   Linda Helgerson, a Washington, D.C., consultant andpublisher of CD-ROM EndUser, says the industry is insomething of a chicken-and-egg dilemma. Publishers aren'tmaking disks for a wide audience because they feel therearen't enough users, while PC users aren't buying CD-ROMattachments because there aren't enough interesting disks todrive.   For now, the world of CD-ROMs offers limited choices forthe general user. It's top-heavy with reference titles:electronic encyclopedias, atlases, and foreign-languagedictionaries.   One big seller with appeal to home and school users is&quot;Mammals,&quot; a joint project of International Business MachinesCorp. and the National Geographic Society. The disk holds 750still images, 40 motion video segments (which can look a bitjerky at 15 frames a second) and 120 animal sounds. IBM saysit has sold about 100,000 &quot;Mammals&quot; disks, at $99 to schoolsand libraries and $149 for consumers. The company says itplans to collaborate with other publishers, though it won'telaborate.   Companies such as Time Warner and Sony, with a variety ofmedia to draw from, should have an edge in creating CD-ROMdisks with wide appeal. Their profits should eventually behigher, too, because they won't have to pay royalties orcopyrights on much of the material they use.   &quot;The guy with the idea to put the history of rock 'n' rollon CD-ROM is brilliant,&quot; says Peter Blakeney, manager inIBM's multimedia and education division, who helped develop&quot;Mammals.&quot; &quot;But now he has to negotiate with every damnartist for rights to music and footage. It's a mine field.&quot;   Time Warner, drawing from its magazines, is puttingjournalism on CD-ROM. Executives who worked on &quot;Desert Storm&quot;are considering CD-ROMs on next year's presidential election,the fall of the Berlin Wall and the savings and loans crisis.&quot;All of this is a foot in the door of a technology that willsomeday be an art form,&quot; says Time's Mr. Duncan.   Sony plans to take a more glitzy approach, eventuallydrawing on music artists at its Columbia and Epic recordlabels and perhaps its Columbia Pictures unit. &quot;We'll startwith reference material first, but we're also looking heavilyinto entertainment-related discs,&quot; says Olaf Olafsson,president of Sony Electronic Publishing. &quot;CD-ROM is going totake off, and our interest is with consumers, where realmoney is. Now we just have to get it in people's hands.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
