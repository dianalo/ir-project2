The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Thursday that the nation's3,147 savings institutions lost $3.2 billion in the fourth quarterof 1987, pushing red ink for the year to $6.8 billion, the worstloss since the agency began keeping track in 1934.   ``I hope it's the worst we'll ever see,'' said James W.Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of SavingsInsitutions, the industry's largest trade group.   The bank board said Sandamp;L losses were heavily concentrated instates like Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, which are dependent onthe ailing oil and gas industry.   The worst 20 institutions _ most of them in the Southwest _ losta total of $2.1 billion in the final quarter of last year,accounting for two-thirds of the overall industry loss.   ``The No. 1 item on the agenda is to stop the bleeding in theSouthwest,'' Christian said. ``That's in the bank board's lap. ...And we hope they do it sooner rather than later.''   Until recently, the bank board has been forced to keep insolventinstitutions open because it lacked the money to pay off depositorsor entice a healthier Sandamp;L into merging with the sick institution.   The bank board said 345 Sandamp;Ls were insolvent at the end of theyear, 109 in Texas alone. An Sandamp;L is considered insolvent when itsloans and other assets are worth less than what it owes todepositors and other creditors.   By the tougher accounting standards the bank board will be usingnext year, 510 would be considered insolvent.   Yet, regulators closed only 17 institutions in 1987 and providedassistance for the merger of 26 others.   Now that money has begun flowing from a three-year, $10.8billion recapitalization enacted in August, bank board Chairman M.Danny Wall has pledged to pick up the pace.   Last month, he announced a plan to spend $6 billion to $7billion in Texas over the next several years, but the bank boardsaid Wednesday it expected no announcements on specificinstitutions before early April.   Martin A. Regalia, chief economist of the National Council ofSavings Institutions, warned that the bank board must move swiftly.   ``On balance, next year will be not quite as bad, but thatdepends on how quickly you get rid of these institutions'' in theSouthwest, he said.   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, said he believedthe industry's problems have ``plateaued out'' and that ``there issome light at the end of the tunnel'' in the Southwest.   Industry losses in 1987 were nearly 50 percent greater than theprevious post-Depression record of $4.6 billion, set in 1981, whenthe prime lending rate soared above 20 percent.   Insured Sandamp;Ls lost $1.8 billion in the third quarter of last yearand $1.9 billion in the spring. They earned $100 million in thefirst three months of the year and had a modest $132 million profitfor all of 1986.   In contrast, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said earlierthis month that the nation's 13,700 federally insured commercialbanks earned $3.7 billion in 1987. Still, it was their lowestprofit since 1933.   Despite the overall loss for the Sandamp;L industry, 66 percent of theSandamp;Ls earned money in the fourth quarter. The $1.3 billion earningsof 2,089 Sandamp;Ls partly offset the $4.5 billion losses of theremaining 1,058 institutions.   The percentage of institutions earning a profit has declinedsteadily for two years, from 81 percent in the first quarter of1986 to 66 percent at the end of last year.   Barth said part of the overall industry loss in 1987 can beattributed to a decrease in the corporate tax rate. He said someSandamp;Ls decided to push profits into 1988, when the top tax rate is 34percent, rather than take them in 1987, when the rate was 40percent.</TEXT></DOC>
