Drew Lewis, chairman, told securities analysts in New York that he expects 1988 net to be &quot;in line&quot; with analysts' projections of $5.40 a share. Last year, Union Pacific net was $582.9 million, or $5.10 a share, on revenue of $5.94 billion.    The railroad, trucking and resources company said third-quarter net declined 7.3% to $165 million, or $1.44 a share, from $177.9 million, or $1.55 a share, in the year-ago period. The drop was tied to a $23 million net gain related to the restructuring of operations in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding the year-ago gain, earnings from continuing operations rose 6%.    Quarter revenue rose 11% to $1.68 billion from $1.51 billion. Union Pacific stock closed at $61.25 a share, up $1.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    The company said earnings of its Union Pacific Railroad unit increased 22% in the quarter on an 11% rise in freight carloadings. The growth reflects primarily increased shipments of metals and ores, automobile and chemical traffic, it added.    For the first nine months of the year, Union Pacific net totaled $456.4 million, or $4 a share, up 3% from $443.2 million, or $3.87 a share, the previous year. Revenue totaled $4.9 billion, up 11% from the year-earlier $4.41 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
