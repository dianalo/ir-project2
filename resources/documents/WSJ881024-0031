In the foreign exchange market, the perception is that the Bundesbank is unconcerned about the dollar's loss of about nine pfennigs since the beginning of the month, and this is bolstering the West German currency.    While Japanese and French monetary officials voiced apprehension last week about an accelerated dollar fall from prevailing levels and hinted at central bank intervention, the West German central bank has kept quiet.    Market participants, quick to put the Bundesbank to the test, sent the dollar tumbling. In late trading Friday, the dollar stood at 1.7775 marks, down from 1.7991 marks Thursday.    On Sept. 30, the dollar hovered near 1.8700 marks, but the sharply wider August U.S. trade deficit and lessened expectations for higher U.S. interest rates have dealt it a strong blow.    Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at 126.18 late Friday, off from 126.90 on Thursday, and compared with 134 yen at the beginning of the month.    In Tokyo on Monday, the dollar opened for trading at 126.17 yen, down from Friday's close of 126.40 yen.    Many traders insist central bank support by West Germany or other major monetary nations is the crucial element needed to halt a steady dollar erosion.    &quot;We're at levels now where it's going to become necessary for the central banks to at least show some attempt to temper the decline in the dollar,&quot; says Howard Levine, an institutional futures specialist for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.    He says the dollar already has broken through crucial support at 1.78 marks, adding that a break through the 125 level is nearby. A lack of intervention shortly, he contends, could prompt a fall to 1.7350 to 1.7450 marks and 125 yen.    Many participants don't expect the Bundesbank -- or any other central bank -- to intervene unless the dollar comes under extremely heavy selling pressure, however, Mr. Levine of Shearson is more optimistic.    &quot;My guess is that this week the Bundesbank will come in&quot; and likely sell marks for dollars, he says.    In contrast to West Germany, Japan is seen easing its policy slightly since the Bank of Japan trimmed its one-month, two-month and three-month bill discount rates last week, thus eliminating some of the downward pressure on the dollar against the yen.    However, foreign exchange dealers say support for the dollar by the Bundesbank could come by way of marks sales for French francs.    The mark Friday reached a record 3.4200 francs, but traders say neither the Bundesbank nor the Bank of France were seen intervening.    While the weaker dollar, the lack of French intervention and a public-sector labor dispute in France are all influences that have fueled mark buying, pressures in the European Monetary System are an obstacle.    In the EMS, which was last aligned on Jan. 12, 1987, currencies are held within fixed ranges against each other. The mark's EMS ceiling, at which point central banks are obliged to intervene, is 3.4305 francs.    If actions are taken to curb the mark's strength, &quot;they may help keep the brakes&quot; on the dollar, says Tammis Vibbard, an investment officer for Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank.    Aside from West Germany and France, other EMS nations include the Netherlands, Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg and Italy.    The tensions in the EMS have led to speculation about a realignment, possibly early next year. However, Hans-Dieter Wichter, a spokesman for the West German Finance Ministry, said Friday that Bonn doesn't contemplate a realignment at the moment.    On the New York Commodity Exchange Friday, gold for current delivery dropped $3.80 to $408.40 an ounce. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.4 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Monday, gold was quoted at $407.10 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
