<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-42-0044 </DOCNO><TEXT>The circulation system of fluidized heat carrier was used to develop thenew concept of coal gasifier, which was composed of two main reactorsand two adjoining downcomers within a single vessel. For the presentresearch period (1984-1986) this system came into operation with thefollowing combined mode of pyrolysis and partial oxidation to producemedium Btu gas. Basic research projects, which enabled the proposed conceptto be realized, were also carried out. A new mathematical model takinginto account of the dynamic change of the surface oxide concentrationon the char surface with the circulation of char particles was proposed.Furthermore, a new estimation method of the atmospheric gasificationrate, using only the gasification temperature and the coal rank, wasdeveloped for the chars within the fluidized bed gasifier. 33 refs.,9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
