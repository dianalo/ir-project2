The chemical compounds are used inaerosol products, refrigerators and air conditioners.   Her speech came after Prince Charles on Monday called for acomplete ban by century's end of the synthetic chemicals.   The meeting began Sunday and 20 countries have since joined the31 that signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol requiring that productionof the compounds chemicals be cut in half by the turn of the century.   Mrs. Thatcher acknowledged that action on the compounds waslikely to begin in industrial nations.   However, she added, ``It is not a case of some countries askingother countries to act. It is a case of every country takingaction.''   She said the world's people must ``change their customs andhabits in what they buy and what they do'' in order to ``overcomeone of the greatest challenges to life on Earth.''   The compounds are stable and non-toxic when released into theatmosphere, but when they rise 15-25 miles to the stratosphere, 10to 100 years later, they break apart and their chlorine atomsdestroy the ozone shield that protects the Earth from the sun'scancer-causing ultraviolet rays.   The compounds also trap heat and warm global temperatures,causing potentially major climate changes in a process known as thegreenhouse effect.   In other remarks today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agencychief William Reilly told reporters: ``I think we are all in thistogether. We are all going to have to find ways to collaborate andclear this mess up. It affects us all.''   Delegates from China and India on Monday urged the industrialnations to create a fund to help developing nations replace thecompounds with safe substitutes.   Vladimir Zhakarov, head of the Soviet delegation, told theconference Monday that his country needs more scientific evidencethat CFCs destroy the ozone layer before it will agree to speed upits phaseout of such chemicals.   ``If we take a decision which is not well-grounded, we caninterfere and destroy the economies of the developing countries,''he said.   The United States and the 12-nation European Economic Communityhave said they will press for a total ban on the compounds by theend of the century.   Prince Charles said Monday that, ``There is surely anoverwhelming scientific case to change the (Montreal) treaty from areduction to complete elimination.''   The heir to the British throne, who banned aerosols with thecompounds from his households last year, urged a consumer boycott ofproducts containing the chemicals.</TEXT></DOC>
