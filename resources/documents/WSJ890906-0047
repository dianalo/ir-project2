Yuppie pleasure-seeking. Inner-city alienation. Proximity to South America. The permissive youth culture of the 1960s and 1970s. American individualism. Restraints on police.    These are among explanations offered by government and private drug experts for why the U.S. has a drug epidemic -- more specifically, a crack-cocaine epidemic -- that appears far worse than in any other industrialized country. &quot;There's no question that the U.S. is out in front of other industrial countries in drug use -- and particularly use of cocaine and crack,&quot; says Rand Corp. drug specialist Peter Reuter.    Experts quickly add two notes of caution, however: Most of these are unproven theories, with little hard research to back them up; and, in fact, there are no good data showing just how U.S. addiction rates compare internationally.    The problem isn't uniquely American. U.S. authorities say Colombians are now seeking new markets in Europe, via Spain. European law enforcement personnel are seizing increasing amounts of cocaine, and Spain and Portugal are asking for help in spotting shipments from Latin America. Officials throughout western Europe are increasingly apprehensive.    Says Mr. Reuter: &quot;Europe seems to be moving in the late 1980s along the path we were moving in the mid-1980s,&quot; when cocaine use was up and crack was just beginning to appear. &quot;With prices collapsed here, the wholesalers may be looking around for new markets.&quot;    Some specialists also note that other industrial nations have long had to contend with serious addiction problems equal to or worse than the U.S. crack mess: the Soviet Union and Japan with alcohol, Britain and several other countries with heroin, Sweden with amphetamines.    David Musto, professor of psychiatry and the history of medicine at Yale, keeps reminding policy makers that the U.S. has had a major cocaine epidemic before. From the late 1880s into the early 20th century, varying amounts of cocaine were contained in some prescription drugs, patent medicines and soft drinks, and were widely and legally used as restoratives or mild stimulants.    Whether the problem is unique or just the early stage of a world-wide cycle, why is it so bad here?    &quot;Our form of government has a lot to do with it,&quot; says Dr. Musto of the federal system, where legislating and law enforcement are divided among national, state and local governments rather than centralized in one government as in much of Europe.    Mark Moore, a Harvard specialist on crime policy, offers a different thumbnail explanation for the U.S. primacy in cocaine and crack consumption: &quot;We're bigger, richer, more liberal, maybe a little more pleasure-oriented.&quot;    And his colleague Mark Kleiman cites another aspect of money: &quot;This is a country where crimes that produce income are unusually rewarding. The class system here is less confining than in Europe and there's enough geographic and social mobility that a person who makes big money from crime can really move up the scale.&quot;    Some see other cultural differences at the root of the problem. U.S. society, they say, is more individualistic, more willing to experiment, less likely to impose community restraints on individual behavior. &quot;There's a lack of strong informal controls here, particularly neighborhood controls,&quot; says Mr. Kleiman of Harvard. &quot;In Germany, start to jaywalk and ordinary citizens will tell you not to do that.&quot;    Herbert Kleber, a Yale psychiatrist and drug-treatment specialist currently on leave to serve as William Bennett's deputy in the federal drug policy office, traces much of today's problem to &quot;the myth perpetrated in the early 1970s&quot; -- that cocaine is a safe, nonaddictive, relatively clean drug. That fallacy, he says, was fortified by media reports of cocaine indulgence by jet setters, athletes, movie stars, &quot;what everyone does at parties on Saturday nights.&quot;    Most drug experts believe middle-class and other &quot;recreational&quot; use of marijuana, heroin and cocaine is now declining and the overriding drug problem today is the widespread use of cocaine and crack in the inner cities. Government figures say the total number of drug users is dropping, but the number of chronic cocaine users or addicts is up. Here's where frustration and alienation emerge as explanations: For people whose lives are empty, crack and cocaine provide temporary highs, making them feel good or powerful.    &quot;What is new,&quot; says Stanton Peele, a psychologist with Mathematica Policy Research Inc., &quot;is large numbers of inner-city people -- blacks and Hispanics -- sufficiently disillusioned, a real level of hopelessness. Most northern European countries have nothing remotely comparable.&quot;    A breakdown in law enforcement in the inner cities is another frequently cited factor. Writing in the New Republic, criminologists John DiIulio of Princeton and James Q. Wilson of UCLA declare that &quot;we have a special responsibility to prevent the streets of inner-city neighborhoods from being controlled by those who seek to profit from the trade.&quot; They would like more cops, tougher sentencing, more certain jail time.    Many experts note that law enforcement officials in Europe and Japan operate with a much freer hand than their U.S. counterparts -- fewer restrictions on search and seizure, for example, and greater leeway to wiretap -- and with much tougher penalties available.    &quot;The legal situation in Britain is entirely different,&quot; says Jonathan Cave, a Rand drug researcher. &quot;If you are convicted of drug trafficking there, everything you own is forfeited unless you can prove it wasn't acquired with drug money.&quot; The U.S. has a similar law, but it generally doesn't apply at the state or local level.    Geography and trade patterns also play a significant role in America's problem. Compared to Europe, the U.S. is far more accessible to the cocaine-producing and distributing areas of South America, and long-established legitimate business dealings with those countries ease smuggling into the U.S.    The most peculiarly American aspect of the drug epidemic isn't a cause of it but is probably the main reason for the current level of concern. It is the degree of crime and violence that accompanies drug use here -- a problem severely aggravated by the wide availability of guns. England, Germany or France could have as great a drug problem, experts believe, and yet it probably wouldn't seem as great. As one academic specialist puts it, &quot;they're not armed to the teeth, as we are.&quot;    ---@ The War on Drugs @ Major provisions of Bennett plan    --Expand federal prison capacity by 85% by increasing annual spending to $1.5 billion from $631 million.    --Increase federal aid for prevention and education to $1.2 billion from $943 million.    --Increase federal aid to state and local police to $350 million from $150 million.    --Triple economic and military aid to Bolivia, Colombia and Peru to about $300 million to reduce coca crop and fight traffickers.    --Increase federal funds for treatment to $925 million from $604 million, but also step up federal monitoring of how money is spent.
