Population estimates for 1986 showed that as of July 1, 1986, San Diego reached 1,015,190 in population, and Dallas reached 1,003,520, making them the nation's seventh- and eighth-largest cities respectively. The last city to pass the million mark in a bureau census was Houston, in 1970.    According to the 1986 estimates, the nation's largest cities are, in order: New York (7.3 million), Los Angeles (3.3 million), Chicago (three million), Houston (1.7 million), Philadelphia (1.6 million), Detroit (1.1 million), followed by San Diego and Dallas, San Antonio, Texas, (914,350) and Phoenix, Ariz. (894,070).    The bureau also reported that 182 cities had estimated populations of 100,000 or more in 1986, six more than in 1984 and 11 more than in the 1980 census. One city -- Davenport, Iowa -- is estimated to have dropped below the 100,000 mark since 1984.    Estimates of city population are prepared every two years by the bureau, and they are derived from such data as birth and death statistics, federal income tax returns, and reported immigration statistics. </TEXT></DOC>
