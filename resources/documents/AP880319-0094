In his weekly radio address, the president also said that hesent U.S. troops to Honduras to show ``the seriousness with whichwe view the situation.''   ``There was a nice celebration of St. Patrick's Day up onCapitol Hill this week, but believe me, that wasn't the only reasonCongress knew I had my Irish up,'' the president said.   ``Just as the heroic efforts of the democratic resistance haveforced the communists to cut back on their aggression abroad and tomake peace concessions, the Congress, in a close vote, decided tocut off aid to the freedom fighters,'' Reagan said.   ``Since the Congress rejected our package of assistance forthose fighting for freedom in Nicaragua, the communist dictatorshave done exactly as we predicted,'' he said. ``Instead of givingpeace a chance, the aid cutoff is giving the communist dictators achance.''   ``Instead of negotiating for a cease-fire, they have launched amajor military assault on the weakened Contras, invading democraticHonduras in the process.''   Reagan said the administration's policy has been to ``let thepeople of Nicaragua win back their freedom and their independencefrom the Soviet Union on their own _ to do this without having tocommit American military personnel.''   ``But now, because of Congress' aid cutoff last month, theSandinistas have mounted their major cross-border incursion intoHonduras,'' he said.   The president said he ordered U.S. troops to Honduras onWednesday at the request of Hondurasn President Jose Azcona ``toconduct an emergency readiness exercise.''   ``Our purpose is to send a signal to the governments and peoplesof Central America about the seriousness with which we view thesituation,'' he said.   Meanwhile an administration source said the United States islikely to approve a Honduran request for help in ferrying Hondurantroops to the scene of their battle with the Sandinista forces.   Other U.S. officials said the administration's response to therequest will probably come this weekend.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thegovernment of Honduras asked for U.S. help Friday in transportingan undisclosed number of troops to an area within about 20 miles ofthe Nicaraguan border.   ``The cable came in to the State Department today, but nodecision has been made as yet,'' said an official who asked not tobe identified.   But another official said: ``I can't imagine that we would turnit down. We've done it before.''   The sources said they would be following similar rules to thoseused in December l986, when 40 U.S. helicopters took 700 Hondurantroops and equipment to the Nicaraguan border.   Rules called for U.S. personnel and equipment to stay well awayfrom the scene of fighting to ensure they were not exposed tohostile fire, and no Americans became involved in combat.   All 3,200 of the U.S. troops ordered to Honduras on Wednesday byPresident Reagan had been airlifted into Palmerola Air Base nearTegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, by Friday.   The request for the helicopters came the same day White Housechief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. said the administration would``most carefully'' consider any request by Honduran President JoseAzcona for use of U.S. troops in combat.   Baker was asked in a television interview how Reagan wouldrespond if Azcona asked him to commit U.S. troops to battle torepel Nicaraguan forces.   ``No such request has been received,'' Baker said. ``I do notbelieve such a request will be received. But were it received, toanswer your hypothetical question ... it would be most carefullyconsidered and most deliberately considered.''   Baker was interviewed on the syndicated television program,``John McLaughlin's One on One,'' taped for broadcast over theweekend.   Meanwhile, Sen. Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, a leading Republicancritic of administration military policies, introduced legislationbarring the president from sending the troops into action withoutcongressional approval.   Sending the troops in the first place, Hatfield said, was just``matching stupidity with stupidity.''   At the same time a bipartisan group of 11 senators proposed a$48 million package of new aid to rebels fighting Nicaragua'sMarxist-led government. The package would include renewed authorityfor the Central Intelligence Agency to deliver previouslystockpiled weapons.   Sponsors of the aid proposal said they hoped it would revivenegotiations in Congress and with the administration on an aidpackage that could be quickly enacted to replace supplies lost orexpended during the past week's heavy fighting along theNicaraguan-Honduran border.   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., called the proposal ``acommon-sense, moderate and reasoned approach'' and said it wouldstrengthen the rebels as they enter direct cease-fire talks withthe Managua regime scheduled for Monday.   The proposal would use $48 million in unspent Pentagon money tobuy food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies, and transport itto troops in the field over the next year. About $3 million of thatamount would go for communications gear.   It would allow the CIA to airdrop ammunition and weaponspreviously stockpiled by the rebels to troops in the field. Sen.David Boren, D-Okla, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,said the rebels still have $2 million to $5 million worth ofundelivered supplies, about half of them lethal.   It would give Reagan the right to hold a quick, guaranteed votein Congress on any request for further military aid under certainconditions if the peace talks between the Sandinistas and Contrasbreak down. The bill also would promise long-term economic aid forthe region once political stability is restored.   Action on further aid for the rebels has been stalled sinceMarch 3, when the House narrowly rejected a $30 million package ofpurely humanitarian aid.   The senators who proposed the aid package included sevenRepublicans and four Democrats. They are Boren; Lloyd Bentsen,D-Texas; Bob Graham, D-Fla., Sam Nunn, D-Ga.; Richard Lugar,R-Ind., Daniel Evans, R-Wash., Kassebaum, John McCain, R-Ariz.;Phil Gramm, R-Texas; Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Frank Murkowski,R-Alaska.</TEXT></DOC>
