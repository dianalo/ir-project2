Although the union indicated it would meet with companynegotiators next week, the dispute showed more signs ofescalating than of winding down. When Caterpillar announcedplans last week to end the lockouts of 5,650 workers inAurora and East Peoria, Ill., the construction-equipmentmaker said it was trying to break the deadlock.</LP><TEXT>   The Peoria, Ill., company said it was &quot;extremelydisappointed in the UAW's actions.&quot; In a statement,Caterpillar said it's hard to negotiate &quot;when the unioninsists on an uncompromising, hard-line position.&quot;   The labor dispute, which began with a partial strike Nov.4, already is one of the longest and largest in the privatesector in recent years. It's seen by many labor experts as amajor test of labor's strength.   The decision by the union's central bargaining committeeto expand the strike marks part of a broader attempt by theunion to step up pressure on Caterpillar as the standoffmoves into its fourth month.   Some UAW officials said they feared the company's move toend the lockout was motivated more by a need for equipmentthan by a sincere desire to close the gap in negotiations.The company, however, has said it would make &quot;importantmodifications&quot; to its proposal.   A member of the union's central bargaining committee saidthat unless the company makes &quot;significant improvements&quot; inits offer at a session planned for next week, the union plansto expand the strike further. &quot;It will be like rollingthunder,&quot; he said.   A union spokesman wouldn't comment on plans after nextweek's meeting. But he said union President Owen Bieber, instops Monday and Tuesday at UAW locals in Illinois, pledgedto achieve a &quot;pattern agreement,&quot; that is, one similar tothat negotiated last year at Deere andamp; Co.   The UAW has also told the company that unless it withdrawsa proposal for a separate contract at its parts-distributionfacilities, the union won't be bound to a previous no-strikeagreement in those places.   A strike at those Caterpillar Logistics Services centerscould halt the flow of essential parts to Caterpillarcustomers and other companies serviced by the centers. Thecompany said such a strike would be illegal.</TEXT></DOC>
