The weather was blamed for six traffic deaths _ three inMinnesota, two in Kansas and one in Indiana.   The snowstorm came from a deep low pressure system that developedeast of the Rocky Mountains and intensified as it reached the GreatLakes, said Don Baker, meteorologist with the National WeatherService in Ann Arbor, Mich.   The heaviest snowfalls in Michigan's Upper Peninsula were 18inches in Wakefield, 14 inches in Marquette and 12 inches in L'Anse,Baker said today.   More snow was expected in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, withsnowfall totals in western Upper Michigan possibly approaching 2feet.   ``We did get dumped on quite a bit,'' said Deputy Bruce Davey ofthe Gogebic County Sheriff's Department in the Upper Peninsula.``People around here are pretty resolved we have to deal with thiskind of snowfall in the winter.''   In Minneapolis-St. Paul, a snowfall of 7 inches Tuesday forcedthe airport to close for three hours, the first closing this season.   ``We had 2 to 3 to 4 inches coming down an hour, which is aboutas bad as it gets here,'' said George Condon of the MetropolitanAirports Commission.   Even snow removal crews were taken off the runways. ``We pulledeverybody off the field because the visibility was so bad,'' Condonsaid.   Thunderstorms ahead of a cold front produced large hail anddamaging winds in Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. At DetroitMetropolitan Airport, gusts up to 58 mph were reported Tuesday night.   Earlier Tuesday, strong winds circulating around the powerful lowpressure system swirled dust and snow in the Central Plains.   High winds hammered eastern Colorado. Gusts of up to 120 mphnorthwest of Loveland knocked down trees and utility poles. A dozenski lifts in Colorado's Summit County west of Denver weretemporarily shut down by the wind.   The storm crossed into Oklahoma from Kansas and hit Tulsa duringthe afternoon rush hour, turning the sky a butterscotch color. LarryRuthi a National Weather Service forecaster, said it was Oklahoma'sworst dust storm in five years.   ``This is almost entirely Kansas dirt _ it's brown, not red,'' hesaid.   In Kansas, wind-blown dust piled up against fences like snowdrifts, said Sheriff Ron Achilles of Gove County.   Officials reported scores of traffic accidents statewide,including two fatal ones as the dust storm made the noon sky looklike twilight. Firefighters battled scattered grass fires and manyhighways closed because of poor visibility.   Interstate 70 was closed from Hays to the Colorado border, adistance of 160 miles, from late morning through most of theafternoon because of poor visibility and the need to clear trafficaccidents from the road, said Lt. Jerry Dietz of the Kansas HighwayPatrol.   Hill City, Kan., had a gust at 72 mph around noon.   The high winds and blowing dust combined to shut down Kansas CityInternational Airport for about 90 minutes at the height of thestorm.   ``If you can imagine a handful of dirt in your eyes, that wasit,'' said Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Douglas Griffiths inNorton. ``That's not an exaggeration.''</TEXT></DOC>
