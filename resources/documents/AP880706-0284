Citing high-level senior industry sources, the news agency saidconsultations were under way among officials from Venezuela,Algeria and Ecuador.   The unnamed sources told the news agency the three nations havenot officially contacted other members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries about the proposed meeting.   The agency quoted its sources as saying some OPEC nations wouldgive a ``positive response'' to a call for an emergency session.   But they said major member states may not accept because thereis no guarantee an emergency meeting would have a positive effecton the cartel's policies or oil markets.   The agency did not elaborate, but the reference to nations whichmight object to an emergency meeting apparently meant Kuwait andSaudi Arabia.   Both OPEC states have opposed calls for emergency sessionswithout first establishing clear objectives.   The news agency said its sources hinted that Venezuela, Algeriaand Ecuador might ask OPEC Secretary General Subroto, the formerIndonesian oil minister, to canvass member states about support foran emergency meeting.   Last month, the OPEC nations decided to extend until the end of1988 the production and pricing agreement reached last year.However, several cartel members are overproducing in violation ofOPEC's overall 15.06 million barrels-a-day ceiling.   The agency's sources acknowledged severe weakness in the worldoil market. But they cautioned that without firm policy commitmentsprior to any emergency OPEC meeting, an ineffectual session could``increase the chaos.''   The sources noted that overproduction and the definition ofexactly what constitutes crude oil production are key issues whichwould have to be addressed.</TEXT></DOC>
