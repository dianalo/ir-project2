Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor andHuman Resources Committee, said at least 10 national service billsranging in cost from $5 million to $5 billion have been introducedthis year in the Senate.   The $330 million Democratic consensus package ``includes thebest features of all the bills, and the price tag is withinrealistic constraints,'' he said.   The plan is designed to promote public service among Americansof all ages, with incentives including academic credit, stipends,job training, educational aid and a helping hand for first-timehomebuyers.   Kennedy said his committee is scheduled to complete work on thebill next week in preparation for floor action after the Augustrecess.   Moreover, Kennedy and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, said they hope to achieve a bipartisan measure with Bushadministration support.   ``We will work with our Republican colleagues, our colleagues inthe House, and with the White House'' to pass national servicelegislation, said Mitchell.   Bush favors a purely voluntary approach to such service withoutincentives or stipends and has proposed a $25 million program toencourage such efforts. But Kennedy and others suggested there maybe some room for compromise as the bill moves through Congress.   Key elements of the Senate package include:   _$100 million for school-based opportunities for young people toserve their communities and for aiding residents, particularly theelderly, in volunteering in schools.   _$100 million for full-time or summer youth service corpsprograms modeled after the conservation corps already establishedin many states. The programs would be open to youth aged 16 to 25,with stipends of up to $6,200 a year and post-service education andtraining benefits of up to $100 a week.   _$100 million for a civilian service program with education andhousing vouchers ranging from $8,500 a year for full-timeparticipants to $3,000 a year for three to six years of part-timeservice. Full-time participants also would receive a yearly stipendof $6,200 to $7,000.   _$10 million to expand the Volunteers in Service to America(VISTA) program.   _$20 million to expand volunteer programs for senior citizensunder the Older Americans Act.   The bill contains elements of proposals by Sens. Kennedy; SamNunn, D-Ga.; Charles Robb, D-Va.; Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.;Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; Bob Graham,D-Fla., and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.   Nunn and Robb are credited with sparking the national servicedebate with their proposal last January to make student financialaid contingent on a full-time stint in military or communityservice. Their bill would have phased out current forms of studentaid in five years.   Nunn praised the consensus package Thursday and said it couldstill lead to his goal of requiring national service in return forstudent aid. ``I haven't dropped my original thinking on thesubject, but I do think we ought to go slowly and determine whatworks,'' he said.   Democrats and Republicans alike have criticized the idea oftying aid to service, with many saying that doing so would penalizelow-income students while allowing the affluent to escape serviceobligations and proceed directly with their educations.</TEXT></DOC>
