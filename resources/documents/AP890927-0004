Prensa Latina said Tuesday that Elizardo Sanchez, Hiram AbiCobas and Hubert Jerez were arrested in August and charged withgiving false information to U.S. television networks and RadioMarti, a U.S. government station beamed to Cuba, in an attempt todiscredit Cuban courts.   The prosecution has asked for prison terms of three or fouryears for the three activists.   Prensa Latina said lawyers for the defendants would have 10 daysto study the charges and prepare their cases, and that the trialwould begin within 20 days after that.   The defendants were accused of telling U.S. media that Maj. Gen.Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez had been psychologically tortured and hadconfessed to drug trafficking while under the influence of drugsadministered by his interrogators.   Ochoa, a Cuban war hero, and three other men were executed inJuly following trials that revealed a criminal ring in the Cubandefense and interior departments that helped smuggle drugs fromColombia to the United States.   The trial and the corruption it revealed were extremelyembarrassing to Cuba's communist leader, Fidel Castro, who hadinsisted for years that accusations of drug trafficking were partof a U.S. plot to discredit his government.   The three rights activists were members of a group calledDefenders of Human Rights, which Prensa Latina said was``counterrevolutionary'' and illegal.</TEXT></DOC>
