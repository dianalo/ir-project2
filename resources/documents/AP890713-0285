The issue, set for completion Monday, would have been one of thebiggest Eurobond offerings ever by a non-U.S. company.   The London-based conglomerate said it also withdrew the issue toprotect its investors against substantial losses that could resultfrom ``the hostile and highly leveraged nature of the bid.''   The group, which also includes British merchant banker JacobRothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer, is offering theequivalent of $13.86 a share in debt securities to acquire BAT, atactic that underscores the growing dominance of the American styleon the worldwide takeover scene.   American-sized, it is four times bigger than the previous biggestBritish bid and rivals the record $25 billion buyout earlier thisyear of U.S. food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Corp.   Instead of cash, the group's offer uses junk bonds, an Americanfinancing technique not readily accepted on this side of theAtlantic.   Both sides also have lined up leading American investment bankersas soldiers, and many of the battles are expected to take placebefore American courts and U.S. insurance regulators.   BAT has wide-ranging interests in the United States, includingBrown and Williamson Tobacco Corp., Farmers Insurance Group Inc. andthe Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's department stores.   Forty-one percent of BAT's pre-tax profit and 30 percent of itsrevenue came from North America last year.   BAT immediately rejected the offer from the Goldsmith group afterit was launched Tuesday through a newly formed company calledHoylake Investments PLC.   BAT's shares on London's Stock Exchange continued retreatingtoward the offering price, finishing down the equivalent of 24 centsat $14.05 Thursday.   Junk bonds, such as those the Goldsmith group is offering in itscashless bid, are not as widely used or accepted in Britain, wherehigh-debt ventures are less common than in the United States.   Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk debt securities commonlyused to finance takeovers and corporate expansions in the UnitedStates. Their name comes from their low credit rating, which meansthey have a greater risk of default than higher-rated bonds.   Also new to the relatively staid British takeover scene is thebreak-up of such a large company. Goldsmith said he wanted to``unbundle'' BAT by selling off its non-tobacco interests, which heclaims have depressed the company's stock price.   In the BAT war, the offense has lined up junk bond pioneersDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Bankers Trust Co. among itsfinancing pros. Its legal advisers include Skadden, Arps, Slate,Meagher and Flom, a prominent U.S. takeover law firm.   The defense quickly enlisted Goldman Sachs and Co. and ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc. to help Lazard Brothers and Co. plot its strategy.   Aggressive American investment firms have been leaders indeveloping sophisticated takeover and anti-takeover techniques honedduring the U.S. merger mania of the 1980s.   In addition, ``With all the big buyout funds in the UnitedStates, and most of the big buyout funds being led by Americans,that (lining up American firms) would be both a defensive and anaggressive move,'' said Clive Sherling, a director of the buyoutfirm Alan Patricof Associates Ltd. in London.   BAT's defense might be a management buyout, which could befinanced partly with funds from U.S. investors, Sherling said.   ``I'm sure that it would be led from the States and therefore byhaving American advisers they would have a more direct line to thecash,'' Sherling said.   He also noted the Goldsmith group had enlisted high-powered U.S.takeover firms for the same reason BAT has.   ``If you're sitting there as an aggressor trying to figure outwhat the defensive strategy would be, you would figure they woulduse American advisers and you would try to cut them off at the passand get the best ones,'' Sherling said.</TEXT></DOC>
