The auctions and direct sales of these &quot;emissionsallowances&quot; would be open to anyone, including privatespeculators.</LP><TEXT>   To curb acid rain, the new clean air law sets up apollution-credit trading system that aims to cut by half theannual sulfur dioxide pollution spewing from the nation'sutilities by the year 2000, compared with 1980 levels. Formost existing power plants, the law establishes allowablepollution levels for sulfur dioxide based on past emissionrates and other factors. Utilities that bring emissions belowthe required levels will generate pollution credits that theycan use for expansion or sell to other utilities.   In its proposal, the EPA calls for setting aside forauctions and direct sales as much as 2.8% of the totalemission allowances that would otherwise be available toexisting utilities each year. The auctions and sales willbegin in 1993. One allowance would grant the right to emitone ton of sulfur dioxide a year. Allowances would be soldeither on a spot basis, meaning they could be usedimmediately, or an advance basis, meaning they could betraded but not used for seven years.   The auctions would be held each year by March 31 and beopen to anyone, including those who had received allowances.Purchasers would send sealed bids to the agency specifyingthe number of allowances they want and how much they arewilling to pay. The agency would start with the highestpriced bid and keep selling until all the allowances aregone. The EPA isn't allowed to set a minimum price.   Then, in the second half of the auction, holders ofallowances who want to sell them could submit allowances tobe auctioned by the agency. These private holders could set aminimum price.   In addition, direct sales would begin by June 1 of eachyear. The EPA would sell them for $1,500 each, on afirst-come, first-served basis. Any that aren't sold would beoffered at the next auction.   New independent power producers, which tend to be smallwholesalers that provide power to utilities, would get thefirst chance to buy allowances at the direct sale.   The EPA will accept comments on the proposed rule for 45days and will hold a public hearing June 5.</TEXT></DOC>
