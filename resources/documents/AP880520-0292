Bethlehem Steel Corp. Chairman Walter Williams says a UnitedSteelworkers union representative told him recently that 1989``will not be a concession year.''   ``I guess with the industry looking better they have a right tosay that,'' Williams told reporters during the American Iron andSteel Institute annual meeting in Washington.   Even at LTV Steel Co., which is reorganizing under Chapter 11 offederal bankruptcy laws, ``there's not been tremendous pressurefrom creditors to cut labor costs,'' President David Hoag saidThursday.   Those remarks and others could hearten USW members who retreatedon wages, benefits and featherbedding work rules in two rounds ofbargaining since 1982.   Contracts at the major producers are due for renegotiationbeginning next year.   ``If we have a somewhat inflationary labor increase in the U.S.I think the stock market would overlook it,'' said securitiesanalyst Peter Marcus of PaineWebber Inc.   Plant closings and automation have combined with contractgivebacks to help cut labor costs for a ton of shipped steel from$262 in 1982 to $160 last year. That shift lessened the impact ofwages on production costs.   ``Also we have had fairly fearsome increases in wages abroad,''Marcus said Thursday during a panel discussion. ``In Korea lastyear they had a 23 percent wage increase, and the Korean wonincreased on the order of 10 percent.''   Analyst James Rudolph of Buckingham Research Group said thatwith no signs of rampant inflation, wage increases would notnecessarily hurt steel companies, which are enjoying a recovery ofuncertain duration after five years of devastating losses.   Peter Anker of First Boston Corp. was more concerned about wagehikes and encouraged managers to offer stock or a share of profitsto workers instead of ``just another escalation of wage costs.''   Willaims said he hopes USW negotiators realize ``we're not outof the woods yet.''   He stressed the need for further work rule changes that would``foster more efficient job combinations, reduce idle time andallow greater flexibiliy in job assignments.''   Williams said each job eliminated through work rule changessaves as much as a 10 percent cut in labor costs for 15 workers.   Labor costs _ including wages, benefits, unemployment insurance,pension payments and other costs _ peaked for blue-collar steelworkers in 1982 at $26.29 per hour and declined to an average of$23.70 last year, according to the AISI.   Blue-collar employment fell from about 190,000 in 1982 to121,000 in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
