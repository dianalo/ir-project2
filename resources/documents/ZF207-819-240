Those of you who are long time readers might havenoticed that we seem to be spending a lot of time testing and reporting onlaptop computers.andP;  We are for a number of very good reasons.andM;First of all, according to the companies who keep track of sales figures forthe industry, the laptop segment of the market is growing faster than anyother, and offers better potential growth than the desktop segment.andP;  Next, ofcourse, is the fact that many venfors have chosen this year, and especially,these last six months of the year, to enter the market-place with newproducts.andP;  Lastly, I have to admit, since I travel so much, I am alwayslooking for the &quot;right&quot; laptop to carry with me, just as I am still lookingfor the &quot;right&quot; hanging suitcase.andM;The desktop &quot;wars&quot; are rather boring right now.andP;  Everyone is announcing a new25 or 33 MHz 386 system, or a new twist or wrinkle to existing products.andO;Hewlet-Packard announced a new i486 EISA-based machine but isn't deliveringit.andP;  Being the first to announce an undeliverable product is not veryexciting to me.andM;So, back to laptops.andP;  What is happening here will have an impact on desktopcomputing as well.andP;  The more remote and extended computing that takes place,the more need there will be to integrate it into the corporate LAN, orconnect it to the corporate mini or mainframe.andP;  The better the laptops get,the more &quot;direct&quot; connect requirements will be made of existing networks, andthe more users will scream for some relief from &quot;data transferitis.&quot;andM;The more laptops sold, the more desktop units will be sold.andP;  The more laptopssold, the more opportunity to add-in and add-on vendors and their products.andO;The more laptops sold, the more requirements for better telephone access todata networks, and therefore, the better these networks will be come for allof us.andM;How will laptop sales help desktop sales?andP;  There are potential users out inthe world who might opt for a Macintosh or Compaq, or Toshiba laptop to betheir &quot;one machine for all locations&quot; who would not, initially, purchase adesktop machine.andP;  However, after a while they too will come to realize thatit is still better and easier to have a machine which is stationary somewhereand a second portable machine than just a portable alone.andP;  Users of the&quot;portable only&quot; concept will find that they might want more capability ontheir desk than they can get using the laptop as a base.andP;  So, after a whilethey will choose to add a second computer to their stable s, only it won't bea laptop, but a desktop unit.andM;Also, if more and more executives start carrying the Poquet PC or the AtariPortfolio, the Sharp Wizard or the Casio BOSS, they will become aware ofsavings in both cost and time using computers properly.andP;  This, in return, cancause a higher rate of PC growth within their own companies.andM;Our newsletter's major thrust is still the world of the desktop, but we alsoexplain to prospective readers that we cover the desktop and anything thatcan and is connected to it.andP;  This includes mini's, mainframes, and of course,laptops and handhelds.andP;  These wonderful little take-anywhere computers arechanging the way in which we do business: from attorneys who use laptops andcellular phones in court to connect their offices for last minute updates andresearch, to the insurance salesman, to writers on the road, to executivesmaking presentations.andM;The next wave of products I see are the ones that will permit laptops andLANs to share data easily.andP;  They will be the personal productivity toolswhich address the use of desktops, laptops, notebooks, and handheldcomputers.andP;  As computers become more portable, more capable, and moreabundant, their uses will change.andP;  Oh, they will still be used for the usualword processing, database and spreadsheet activities, but they will also beused as an electronic briefcase, filled to overflowing with bits and piecesof electronic paper, notes, expense listings, day books, to do lists, and allof the other things one finds there (can disk-based &quot;paperback&quot; novels be farbehind?).andM;Already the use of cellular phones has increased the productivity of thebusiness traveler and the stay-at-home-executive.andP;  In the next few years thecellular phone system will become a major communications link for computersas well.andP;  Beyond cellular is satellite cellular phone systems.andP;  This is notas far away as some of you might think.andP;  The FCC has already issuedexperimental licenses and there are many companies working towardsimplementing this type of nationwide service by the early 1990's (which bythe way are less than three months away!!!).andP;  Once this system is put intoplace we will have ready access to data networks in every single nook andcranny of this country.andP;  The archaeologists working on a &quot;dig&quot; in the middleof the desert and the corporate executive on the golf course will each havecomplete access to their E-Mail, databases, and other information.andM;Laptop and portable computers are important to the industry, not just for thecurrent small percentage of users who have a need for them, but for all ofus.andP;  They will continue to impact how we do business and what we do with ourdata.andP;  The software vendors must be aware of the laptop user community andmust realize that communicating with a laptop should be part of either theoperating system communications support or that of the individual package.andM;Yes, this is truly the year of the laptop, but it is also the start of theyear of the end-user and each succeeding year will prove that laptop anddesktop computing are not two totally different areas, but rathercomplementary ways of providing computing solutions for the end-user.andM;Todays laptops push the envelope of technology.andP;  Desktop users benefitgreatly from these advances and we will all continue to learn how to make useof these tools together.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
