This validation system will be used toassess the degree to which SQL implementations conform to FIPS 127. Betatesting with this software has been completed, and Version 1.2 is the currentversion of the software.The NIST is providing a validation service for a trial use period to verifythe accuracy and completeness of the SQL validation procedures. To assessthe suitability of the test method for testing conformance to the FIPS,NIST solicits the views of industry, the public, and State and local governments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>date:</T2> The test service will start in April 1990 and will continuefor the trial use period until a further notice is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>address: </T2>Written comments concerning the SQL Test Service shouldbe sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology, ATTN: SQL TestService, Technology Building, Room B154, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact: </T2>Joseph Collica, telephone (301)975-3267, or Joan Sullivan, telephone (301) 975-3258, National Instituteof Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information:</T2><T3>Background:</T3> The Federal Information Processing Standard Publication(FIPS PUB) 127, Database Language SQL, was approved on March 10, 1987,and became effective August 3, 1987. In accordance with FIPS PUB 127, relationaldatabase packages acquired for federal use after this date should implementthe standard. The purpose of the SQL standard is to promote portabilityof relational databases applications for use with a variety of databaseimplementations.Federal Agencies should require conformance to FIPS 127 whether databaseimplementations are developed internally, acquired as part of an ADP systemprocurement, used under an ADP leasing arrangement, or specified for usein contracts for programming services. Testing should be required in orderfor agencies to determine if the SQL implementations conform to the FIPSPUB. The NIST SQL Test Suite and the test results provided from the NISTvalidation service are sources for federal agencies to use in making thisdetermination.<T3>Updates to the Test Method:</T3> The Test Suite will be periodicallyupdated and used as the basis for validating FIPS 127 implementations.The update process will be used to correct errors identified in the SQLTest Suite and to introduce new or modified programs as appropriate. Modificationto the Test Suite is also intended to ensure that implementations are beingbuilt according to the technical specifications of the standard. Shouldan interpretation of the FIPS be made that would affect the test suite,these changes would also be reflected during the update process.<T3>Obtaining Validation Services: </T3>The NIST provides validation serviceson a cost-reimbursable basis. These services are available to both theproducers and users of SQL implementations. Upon receipt of a request forvalidation, NIST will supply the client with a SQL Information Pack whichwill include a description of the test service and procedures, an OrderForm, a Software License Agreement, and Scheduling Request. To obtain theSQL Test Suite and documentation the client must return a completed OrderForm and Software License Agreement, along with proper payment to the NIST.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Federal Information Processing Standards Publications(FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technologyafter approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to section 111(d)of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amendedby the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Raymond G.
