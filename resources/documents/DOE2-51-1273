As the steady bias field is incrementally raised,a transition from a linear, reversible behavior of the magnetizationto a nonlinear, irreversible behavior is indicated by the appearanceof magnetic losses and odd harmonic components in the response. Theseharmonics disappear as the bias field or the temperature is increasedabove a certain point, indicating a linear behavior. The disappearanceof the odd harmonics, while the magnetic losses persist, is interpretedas signifying a transition to a state of dissipative flux motion withoutpinning. These measurements demonstrate a new technique for determinationof the lower critical field and the ''irreversibility'' field below whichirreversibility in the magnetization sets in as a result of flux pinning.</TEXT></DOC>
