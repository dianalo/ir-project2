In a statement released in Lisbon, the rebel National Union forthe Total Independence of Angola said it was ``ready now to starttalks with the (governing party) without preconditions.''   The note was signed by Jonas Savimbi, leader of the guerrillas,who receive aid from South Africa and the United States. It saidthe future of Angola ``depends on the will of all Angolans to freethemselves from foreign tutelage.''   The note also said ``peace will come necessarily from directcontact'' between the guerrilla group and the ruling PopularMovement for the Liberation of Angola.   The guerrillas have fought the government since losing a civilwar to the Popular Movement following Angola's independence fromPortugal in 1975. The insurgents have demanded a power-sharingaccord.   Angolan government officials estimate more than 9,000 SouthAfrican troops are in southern Angola aiding the guerrillas. Sovietadvisers and approximately 40,000 Cuban troops aid the governmentforces.   The note said the guerrilla group ``categorically rejects allfictitious interpretation of reconciliation in Angola by way ofamnesty, clemency or any so-called program of harmony.''   The point was an apparent reference to reports Wednesday thatthe government was willing to offer amnesty to the guerrillas ifSouth Africa and the United States halt all support for theinsurgents.   The guerrilla proposal comes on the heels of discussions amongthe United States, Angola, South Africa and Cuba on an end toforeign aid to both sides.</TEXT></DOC>
