(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Strategists for Jack Kemp's presidentialcampaign say George Bush's poor showing in Iowa, coupled withKemp's tough-talking ads against Bob Dole, could put Kemp in therunning for the Republican nomination.   Before last Monday's Iowa caucuses, Kemp had been on a roll inNew Hampshire, using an effective advertising campaign and theendorsement of the influential Concord Monitor to help broadensupport.   But even as his bid to become the conservative alternative toDole and Bush took shape, the New York congressman faced thepossibility of being swept out of the race by former televisionevangelist Pat Robertson.   Using his second-place finish in Iowa _ Kemp came in fourth _Robertson was trying to move Kemp aside and take the mantle of trueconservative. A poll of New Hampshire voters by the Boston GlobeThursday night indicated Robertson had drawn even with Kemp amongpotential Republican voters in next Tuesday's primary.   Charles Douglas, Kemp's New Hampshire campaign manager, says theBuffalo congressman wants to finish second or third in a clusterwith Bush and Dole.   ``We want to be in the 28-30-31 percent range with them,''Douglas said.   He conceded that Kemp cannot afford another fourth-place finish,saying, ``We need to do well here so we can raise money andcontinue on to the South. We need to have at least a close thirdhere.''   Kemp spent most of the week in New Hampshire making his case atcoffee klatches, before high school students and in speeches to theparty faithful. He is hopeful that his energetic person-to-personstyle and strong conservative message will make him theconservative alternative.   John Buckley is Kemp's chief campaign strategist.   ``What you saw tonight,'' Buckley said after Kemp spoke before800 Republicans in Nashua earlier this week,``was Kemp making anappeal to the heart and soul of the Reagan vote in New Hampshire.We consider that to be the largest single vote in the Republicanprimary electorate.''   Buckley said Bush's third-place finish in Iowa presented Kempwith a New Hampshire opportunity he never thought he would see.   ``It was a lucky break that the guy who got severely wounded inIowa was George Bush, (someone) we never thought we could beat inthe New Hampshire primary.''   Kemp's strategy had focused on Dole because, as Buckley put it,Dole is ``extraordinarily vulnerable in New Hampshire because ofhis predilection for raising taxes, his four different positions onoil import fees and his wanting to cut Social Security in a statethat has an elderly, Republican electorate.''   ``We learned a lesson last month in Iowa,'' Buckley said. ``Thenews media was interested in Bush-Dole, Dole-Bush, Bush-Dole,almost as if they were the only two variables.   ``The lesson was that by being very specific on issues in atough, hard-hitting way, we could pry the door open to get peopleto take a look at Kemp.''   Robertson is now running ads in New Hampshire saying he is thebest alternative to Bush and Dole and noting that he has alreadybeaten Kemp.   But Buckley says Robertson can't repeat his showing in Iowabecause of an inherently negative message that won't be effectivein New Hampshire.   ``For all the voters who may be more comfortable with the gloomand doom and dour message of Pat Robertson, that we're going tohell in a handbasket, there are many more who will respond to apositive conservative message,'' Buckley said.   ``I'm a conservative,'' Kemp told a living room full ofRepublicans in Milford. ``But I'll tell you what, folks, somethings need money spent on them. We've got to shelter the homeless;we've got to feed and clothe and take care of people who can't takecare of themselves ... and we've got to have a strong defense.''</TEXT></DOC>
