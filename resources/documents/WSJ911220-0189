The commission's problem is that it has been such a banneryear for misfeasance, malfeasance and other kinds of feasancethat the panel may run out of money.</LP><TEXT>   In keeping with Rhode Island's hard-earned reputation, thestate got off to a fast start in 1991 with the disclosure ofa state-wide banking scandal on Jan. 1. Then came allegationsof pension padding by public officials, disclosures oflawyers lending money to judges who were hearing their cases,and conflict-of-interest violations. Of late, the commissionhas been investigating allegations of unfair hiring andcontracting in the administration of former Gov. EdwardDiPrete.   As a result, the panel is outspending its budget and willrun out of money well before the end of the fiscal year onJune 30. &quot;If we don't get a supplemental appropriation, theonly remedy I have is to lay people off&quot; starting in January,says Mark Eckstein, executive director of the commission,which has a six-member staff.   Some residents of Rhode Island -- whose state motto, wagsjoke, is &quot;Make Us An Offer&quot; -- say the panel won't be missed.Rudy Cheeks, a radio talk-show host, asserts: &quot;Whether theEthics Commission has been alive or dead hasn't made much ofa difference over the years.&quot;   Still, the prospect of not having an ethics commissiondoesn't sit well with many scandal-weary Rhode Islanders. &quot;Ofall the times in the history of Rhode Island when aggressiveprosecution is needed, it's 1991-1992,&quot; says H. Philip WestJr., vice chairman of RIght Now, a coalition of stateinterest groups that is lobbying for tougher ethics laws.Adds Arlene Violet, former state attorney general: &quot;RhodeIsland is out of control in terms of ethics. It needs acheckmate, and the obvious group to do that is the ethicscommission.&quot;   But state officials argue that they're fighting aprojected $50 million deficit and that extra funding is hardto come by. &quot;The state of Rhode Island has in the past yearhad the worst budget deficit in the country on a percentagebasis. We have to resolve that,&quot; says Sheldon Whitehouse,policy director for Gov. Bruce Sundlun.   If the commission isn't granted additional funding, it mayyet keep its doors open by suing the state for revenue. &quot;Ithas been discussed. The {state} constitution says there shallbe an ethics commission,&quot; says Mr. Eckstein.</TEXT></DOC>
