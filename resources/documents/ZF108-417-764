(TheWeek in Review)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Passarella, Ed.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>The old joke about New England's climate goes like this: If you don't likethe weather here, just wait a minute.andP;  In other words, don't bother to openyour umbrella because, by the time you cross the street, you won't need it.andM;Paraphrasing that sentiment for this week's news, we can say: If you don'tlike your processor, just wait a minute.andP;  Whether you're enjoying thesunshine or sheltering from the storm, you'll certainly be doing neither forlong.andM;Our Barometer indicates that although there may be a huge installed base of286 PCs, such systems will be overshadowed by those built around the 386SX inthe coming year's corporate buying plans (Page 142).andM;Meanwhile, our pages are full of news about the next high-pressure areathat's rolling in.andM;The 486 front begins with our First Look at NetFrame's NF-400 (Page 1).andO;Described as a &quot;network mainframe,&quot; the multiple-bus server fared well whenpitted against Compaq's Systempro.andP;  A pair of NetWare 386 NLMs provided anovel way to stress-test this new generation of super servers (Page 6).andM;Compaq isn't idle, though.andP;  We report the imminent availability of a 33MHz486 processor for the Systempro, a desktop Systempro in the long-rangeforecast and a new multiple-processor architecture over the horizon (Page 6).andM;Adding to the multiprocessor momentum this week, Datapoint offers the 7850network server, a proprietary dual-486 system (Page 49).andM;But the 486 news isn't all about multiprocessor super servers.andP;  Everyblizzard begins with a few flurries, and 486-based PC activity continues tointensify.andP;  Everex and Micronics have 33MHz 486s on the way (Page 17).andP;  NCRis about to introduce desktop and tower Micro Channel PCs built on the samechip, as well as a 486 upgrade board for existing systems (Page 18).andP;  AndBitwise Designs has a 25MHz 486-based portable available now (Page 17).andM;Moving to the 486s already out there, we review six 25MHz machines that usethe ISA 16-bit AT bus.andP;  We find considerable performance gains, especiallywhen using caching controllers (Page 81).andM;Intel can't complain about the 486 downpour.andP;  In fact, it's seeding theclouds with volume availability of the 33MHz version, and summer may bringsampling of a 50MHz 486 chip (Page 4).andP;  Intel's also looking to boost thepower of 486 systems with a cache-memory module that would plug intomotherboards designed to accept it (Page 1).andM;Finally, on the software front, the New England weather wisdom also applies:If you don't like the way Windows and OS/2 are being positioned, just wait aminute (Page 1).andM;-- Ed Passarella</TEXT></DOC>
