U.S. consumers spent $40 billion to $50 billion in 1990 topurchase cocaine, heroin, marijuana and other illegal drugs,according to the report. By comparison, Americans spent $37billion on tobacco, $44 billion on alcohol, and $46 billionon the entire criminal justice system at the federal state,and local level.</LP><TEXT>   The study, conducted for the federal drug czar's office byAbt Associates, a research firm in Cambridge, Mass.,represents an unusually ambitious effort to quantifyillegal-drug consumption in the U.S. The dollar estimate,which represents spending as well as such barter as theexchange of sex for crack cocaine, is extrapolated fromvarious government surveys.   Yesterday's release of the report, which showed spendingon illegal drugs in 1990 fell about 22% from 1988, appearedto be aimed largely at spotlighting the Bush administration'sdrug-fighting efforts. Drug czar Bob Martinez said at agathering of state and local drug policy makers that a 22%reduction in cocaine available for consumption &quot;was a resultof both our international efforts as well as our enhanceddomestic enforcement.&quot;   But the reduction more likely reflects a decline in drugabuse that predates the 1988 election. According to datapreviously collected by the Health and Human ServicesDepartment, users of illegal drugs numbered 13 million in1990, down from 23 million in 1985. The dropouts are believedto be chiefly casual users, while those who continue to abusedrugs are mainly hardcore users.   According to the new report, the retail value of cocainein 1990 was $17.5 billion, down from $22.9 billion in 1988.Heroin sales fell to $12.3 billion from $15.8 billion, whilemarijuana sales declined to $8.8 billion from $11.1 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
