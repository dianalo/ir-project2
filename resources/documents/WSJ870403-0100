Period,&quot; he told a group of reporters. Mr. Mulroney intends to take up the trade issue when President Reagan comes here Sunday for his annual summit meeting with the Canadian leader.    The two leaders are expected to discuss strategies for winning broad support for the proposed trade pact, which is designed to break new ground in dismantling barriers to trade in goods and services.    Canada has long complained that U.S. trade remedy laws, particularly the countervailing duty law, have been used by various U.S. interests to harass Canadian exporters to the U.S. Trade remedy laws provide protection from imports of subsidized and dumped products.    &quot;You can't have a free trade arrangement and expect the traditional laws of countervail to apply,&quot; Mr. Mulroney said. Such laws, he said, &quot;can be triggered by any disgruntled group in the U.S. at any given time.&quot;    He said &quot;it would be illogical in the extreme to negotiate&quot; a free trade arrangement &quot;and then have the other side say 'Oh, and by the way, we forgot to tell you all of our nice little tricks on countervail and what-have-you we are going to keep.'&quot; He said there has to be a bilateral mechanism for settling disputes &quot;equitably and in an agreed-upon manner.&quot;    U.S. government officials warned that Congress is unlikely to accept an exemption for Canada from U.S. trade remedy laws. But they said various options are being explored to soften the impact of the laws on Canada.    Philip Trezise, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution in Washington and a former senior U.S. trade negotiator, said that as part of the proposed trade agreement a new U.S.-Canadian agency could be established to resolve trade grievances. Others have said such an agency could be patterned after the International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canadian agency that has been dealing with border water problems since 1909. If the proposed new agency couldn't settle a problem, the petitioner could still seek redress through existing trade remedy laws, Mr. Trezise said.    Paul Wonnacott, professor of economics at the University of Maryland, also proposed a relaxation for Canada of the level at which subsidized goods become subject to countervailing duty. Countervailing duty now isn't applied if the foreign subsidy is less than 0.5% of the product's value.    U.S. and Canadian negotiators say they are progressing in the trade negotiations, but they decline to disclose details. Their aim is to complete the negotiations by October so that the U.S. Congress can consider and ratify an accord by Jan. 3.    The proposed arrangement would involve eventual elimination of tariffs between the two countries, which last year carried on $125 billion (U.S.) of trade. Mr. Mulroney said Canadian negotiators have been instructed to ensure that the removal of tariffs takes place gradually.    The trade agreement isn't expected to include agriculture. The countries intend to try to reduce obstacles to agriculture trade within a multination framework. </TEXT></DOC>
