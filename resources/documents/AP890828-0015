I think that has been the SovietGeneral Staff calculation for years, and I think it has got to beeven more the conclusion'' now that the communists have lost controlof the Polish government, said A. Ross Johnson, a former RAND Corp.expert on Warsaw Pact military forces who now heads Radio FreeEurope.   Unless the Soviets have firm control of Polish rail lines, theywould face grave difficulties waging a ground war in Europe,according to analysts who have studied the issue for the Pentagon.   Ian Cutherbertson, a British expert on Eastern Europe, said,``The Soviets long have realized the unreliability of the PolishArmed Forces. Most of them are earmarked to protect Sovietcommunications lines in Poland for the Group of Western Forces,''the half-million Soviet troops in East Germany.   The chances that Polish or other Warsaw Pact units actually wouldsee combat in a European war would be greatly diminished if SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev carries out his proposal to reduceSoviet troop levels Eastern Europe from 625,000 to 350,000, whilecutting Red Army tank forces in half. President Bush has proposedsmaller cuts in Atlantic Alliance forces.   ``Gorbachev is in the process of withdrawing the forces thatwould give the Soviets surprise capability,'' said a U.S.intelligence analyst.   Questions about the loyalties of the Polish army began long ago,although the emergence of a Solidarity government marks a watershedin western perception of the issue.   Poland has the second largest military in the Warsaw Pact, withjust over 600,000 Army and uniformed police forces, includingreserves, according to a 1986 RAND study written for the Pentagon bya former Polish officer, Michael Sadykiewicz, now a consultant inLondon.   According to Sadykiewicz and other analysts with access tointelligence data, Kremlin war plans call for most of the Polishforces to guard rail and communication lines that would be needed toreinforce frontline Soviet units in East Germany.   As many as 1 million Soviet troops would move across Poland inthe event of war, occupying the country along the way, according tosome Western estimates.   Many Polish generals, including President Wojciech Jaruzelski,were trained in the Soviet Union, but loyalty to the Kremlindecreases down the ranks of the mainly conscript army, said Johnsonand Cutherbertson, a scholar at the Institute for East-West SecurityStudies in New York.   ``They had conscripts coming directly out of Solidarity and thereis evidence that they were seen as much less reliable than theconscripts of the 1970s,'' said Johnson.   But analysts, cautioning against the assumption that the PolishArmy will refuse to fight alongside the Soviets, cite contradictoryevidence of Polish loyalties.   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa and the new Polish Prime MinisterTadeusz Mazowiecki have given assurances that the Communist Partywill head the defense and interior ministries, which control themilitary and the police, and that Poland will remain in the WarsawPact.   Additionally, President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the communist leaderwho declared martial law against Solidarity on Dec. 13, 1981,remains president, with the power to declare a new state ofemergency.   The army, in cracking down on Solidarity eight years ago, provedthat it could be used by the government against popular unrest.However, one defector, Ryszard Kuklinski, a former colonel in thePolish Armed Forces, has written that Jaruzelski long resistedKremlin pressure to use the military against the independent tradeunion.   The uncertainty of Polish loyalties has led the Kremlin to assignjust over half of Poland's military and police units to defend the``internal front'' against domestic unrest, said Sadykiewicz,drawing on his years in the Polish military.   A smaller group, including elite and maritime paratroop units,would advance with Soviet forces on a so-called ``second echelonfront'' across the Baltic and into Denmark, away from the mainbattleground, Germany, according to Sadykiewicz and other experts.   Red Army generals have planned to position ``Soviet forces infront of, beside and even behind the Polish forces'' to ensure thatthey would advance across Western Europe in step with any Sovietoffensive, said Johnson.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITORS _ Bryan Brumley, a Washington-based writer who coversnational security issues for The Associated Press, was an APcorrespondent in Moscow 1981-82 and Warsaw 1983-84.</TEXT></DOC>
