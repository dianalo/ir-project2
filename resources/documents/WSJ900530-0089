But last September, the entrepreneur returned to run ASK,a Mountain View, Calif., producer of management informationsystems for manufacturing companies. Her goal: to bring backthe entrepreneurial spirit to a company that lost it.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Many aging entrepreneurial companies are trying torestore the energy and vitality that brought them theirinitial success,&quot; says William Sahlman, an associateprofessor of finance at Harvard Business School. Especiallyafter professional managers have succeeded foundingentrepreneurs, companies often start &quot;looking for someoneelse to stir up the pot,&quot; he says.   Ms. Kurtzig's unusual experience of running a company fora second time shows one approach to the difficult problem ofreviving the entrepreneurial spirit. So far, the 42-year-oldexecutive has redesigned products, got rid of laggardmanagers, recruited new directors with entrepreneurialbackgrounds, and subtly changed the atmosphere. Employeeseven say the food and beer at the &quot;Friday bash&quot; haveimproved.   Even though ASK had sales of $186.3 million for the yearended last June 30, &quot;Its business had grown stale,&quot; saysPeter West, ASK vice president, business development. True,earnings in fiscal 1989 climbed to $13.5 million, or $1 ashare, from $10.8 million, or 82 cents a share, a yearearlier. But directors anticipated a decline, and sureenough, in the nine months ended March 31, profit dropped 73%to $2.4 million, or 18 cents a share, from $8.7 million, or65 cents a share, a year earlier.   While earnings had climbed in recent years, ASK hadconcentrated too much on creating products for theminicomputer and failed to develop products for the emergingworkstation market, analysts say. And although the companyhad been exploring new products and new markets, &quot;itstoe-in-the-water approach would hurt it somewhere down theroad,&quot; says Charles E. Taylor Jr., an analyst atPrudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Since returning to ASK, Ms. Kurtzig has discovered thatreviving the entrepreneurial climate in an 18-year oldcompany can be a formidable task. The company that she andher husband, Ari, started in a second bedroom now has 55offices world-wide and nearly 1,000 employees. But ASK, whichonce dominated the market for information systems formanufacturers, has relinquished a large share to a number ofaggressive newcomers.   &quot;Sandy's advantage is that she knows the business andhelped put it in place,&quot; says Paul Ely, a venture capitalistwho joined ASK's board this year. &quot;Founders are the best flagcarriers.&quot;   In 1972, Ms. Kurtzig quit as a marketing specialist with aGeneral Electric Co. unit, and she and her husband launchedASK -- named for the first initials in their names, Ari andSandra Kurtzig. At first, the company developed software forassorted business applications, but in 1978, it came up witha program that ran on a Hewlett-Packard Co. minicomputer andcould help small manufacturing companies run an entire plant.The program was an instant hit, and ASK's profit and salessoared. ASK went public in 1981. Two years later, Ms.Kurtzig's personal stake in ASK was valued at $67 million.   By 1985, Ms. Kurtzig was divorced from her husband andraising two sons, then aged 12 and 9. When she resigned asASK chief executive, the company recruited top managementwith a big-business background.   &quot;I felt guilty about all the attention I got, became tiredof being the news,&quot; Ms. Kurtzig says. The divorce, ashareholder lawsuit concerning shares she sold at a secondarystock offering, and the constant focus on her as the firstwoman to head a major high-technology concern took theirtoll. &quot;It all became very wearisome,&quot; she says.   After Ms. Kurtzig left, ASK continued to post earningsgains. But &quot;it lost its entrepreneurial edge and marketleadership,&quot; says Mr. Taylor, the Prudential-Bache analyst.Unlike Ms. Kurtzig, who constantly met with fellow employeesand workers, and was closely involved with ASK's operations,the new managers were distant and unapproachable, says Mr.West, the business development vice president.   Moreover, investment in new products declined to nearzero. During Ms. Kurtzig's earlier tenure, the company hadbeen plowing back almost half of its research and developmentfunds into new product development; later, practically allthe Randamp;D money was used to enhance existing products.   By the middle of last year, ASK's board was determined tobring Ms. Kurtzig back. In the four years after she left ASK,Ms. Kurtzig wrote her autobiography, traveled extensively andinvested in a few Silicon Valley companies. But &quot;you couldsee she was frustrated at not having found the right companyto run,&quot; a close friend says. When the board asked her tocome back as chief executive, she readily agreed.   Among her first steps was to bring on entrepreneuriallyminded people to the board. To increase employeeparticipation in ASK, Ms. Kurtzig asked research anddevelopment employees to rate the performance of thedivision's managers. The top-rated managers were rewardedwith greater responsibility, she says. Most of those whoreceived low ratings are &quot;not with the company any more,&quot; shesays.   She also put an end to the practice of senior managersgiving themselves hefty raises and bonuses. &quot;I don't like theidea of one group giving itself bonuses over others who alsodeserve it,&quot; she says. &quot;It creates divisiveness. It preventsteam-playing.&quot; Focusing on team spirit and communication, Ms.Kurtzig tries to attend many company meetings to observe andfollow what is happening.   When problems loom, Ms. Kurtzig has been quick tointervene personally. When customers of a product line thatwas recently acquired by ASK complained that they felt&quot;insecure and unsure of ASK's commitment&quot; to them, Ms.Kurtzig met with the user group to outline plans for theproduct and reassure users.   She also is working on ASK's next generation of products,making them simpler to use and compatible with differenttypes of computers and data bases, says Nicholas Coutros, amanufacturing technology analyst with Ferris, Baker Watts,Inc., a Baltimore brokerage firm. ASK also is increasing itsefforts to sell its products for a variety of computersystems, including those made by International BusinessMachines Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. And the company,which sold its products directly to users, now is exploringother sales channels as well. To position itself in a newglobal manufacturing market, ASK is establishing offices inEurope and Asia.   Mr. Coutros says he doesn't expect all these changes topay off on the bottom line for a year or so. But Ms. Kurtzigsays ASK has more opportunities now than it did when shefounded the company. An established base of customers andalmost $30 million in cash give ASK a &quot;head start on itscompetitors,&quot; she says.</TEXT></DOC>
