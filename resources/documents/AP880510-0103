Window hours at most post offices have been reduced by ahalf-day a week, and Sunday sorting operations and box collectionswere cut earlier this year, following congressionally imposedbudget reductions for the agency.   The service reductions save $9 million a month, Frank said, andrestoring them means that amount of money must be saved in someother way, with improved efficiency and cutting other spending.   Rate increases imposed on April 3 do not affect the servicechanges, Frank said. The accounting system required by Congressresults in the increased income being counted as a reduction in thenational debt, not as extra money for the agency.</TEXT></DOC>
