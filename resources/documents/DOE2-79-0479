This sector consumed in 1984,a year that was suitable from climate and trade conditions point of view,c. 11.6 TWh electricity. All industry consumed 44 TWh that year. Energyconsumption divided into electricity and fuels, was studied theoreticallyand divided into 10 production processes and 5 installation processes.This is novel and has not been done before. The theoretical electricityconservation potential was estimated to 1.5 - 2 TWh for unchanged productionmake-up and volume, and by future energy prices. Energy mapping, bothsimple surveys and more extensive measurements and analyses, in totallyc. 53 enterprises indicates an energy conservation potential by futureenergy prices of c. 10-20% compared to todays electricity consumption.During step 2 it is suggested that also the big industry, the electricityintense industry will be studied. Furthermore the activities will bedirected towards testing of different measures by the ultimate consumers.Definite extent of step 2 will be planned during spring 1988 and resultin an activity plan, including scope, schedules, and costs.
