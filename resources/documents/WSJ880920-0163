Dukakis Is Soft on Crime? </HL><AUTHOR> Joseph Pereira (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   If a motorist was going to get caught speeding, there used to be no better place than Massachusetts. Maximum fine: $50 -- even if the speedometer was registering 90 miles per hour in a 25 mph zone.    &quot;New Yorkers passing through Massachusetts used to snicker whenever I wrote them a ticket,&quot; says Cpt. Robert McKeon of the state police. &quot;'Huh, $50? It was worth it,' they'd smile and drive off.&quot;    Last month, however, Massachusetts stiffened the penalty. Now it's $50 for going up to 10 mph over the speed limit and $10 for each mile an hour above that.    Which means those fines can really add up. Take the case of the motorcyclist who was recently clocked going 125 mph in a 55 mph zone just south of Boston. He received the usual &quot;Have a good day&quot; remark from the highway patrol -- and a $650 ticket.    Now the cyclist has the option of either paying the fine or contesting it in court. Should he do the latter, he will come before Stoughton, Mass., District Court Judge Joseph McLean. While the judge won't indicate how he might rule on the case, he does acknowledge that &quot;the fine is stiff. Most people don't have $650 to spend on a traffic ticket. I know I don't.&quot;    The new penalty system has upset many people, including police chiefs and city officials. Under the old rules, the town in which the violation occurred split the fine 50-50 with the state. Now the town gets to keep $25 and the state, the balance.    Not fair, protests Brewster, Mass., Chief of Police James Ehrhart, who has filed a complaint with his state representative. The chief says each time he sends an officer to court to defend a ticket, it costs $45 to $75 in pay. &quot;It could cost more to write a ticket than to get one,&quot; he says.    A bill proposing an even split was introduced in the Legislature last month. Gov. Michael Dukakis's administration opposes the measure: Massachusetts will be $200 million in debt by the end of next year, some officials estimate, and it is loath to give up the estimated $7 million annually it stands to reap from the fines.    Meanwhile, some traffic officers are keeping track of the biggest tickets written. The largest so far: $700, received by a motorist allegedly going 130 mph in a 55 mph zone near Malden, Mass.    It seems the driver was in a hurry to get to work -- an excuse the ticketing officer didn't buy. It was 3 o'clock in the morning. And the driver's destination was only 30 miles away. </TEXT></DOC>
