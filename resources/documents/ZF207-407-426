 Some mayfeel that the computer world has brought its afflictions upon itself with allthis permissive talk of Open Systems and networking.andP;  But at a recent seminaron computer viruses organised by IBC Technical Services Ltd in London, thefinger was pointed at the real perpetrators of the infection - thetechnopaths.andP;  Once revered as &quot;hackers&quot;, these highly skilled users are nowthe scourge of computer literate societies everywhere as they unleash plagueson software.andP;  So what is the background to this Black Death of the personalcomputer, and what, if anything, can be done about it?andM;The ins and outs of viruses, wormsandM;Robert Jacobson of International Security Technology Inc, startedandM;the proceedings by outlining the background to the virus phenomenon.andP;  The twoevents that silenced those that had passed  off viruses as a passing mediafashion were the &quot;worm&quot; of November 1988 which shut down 6,000 computers onthe Internet network, and the Jerusalem virus which wiped out thousands ofpersonal computers in Silicon Valley, California on Friday the thirteenth ofJanuary, 1989.andP;  (By the way, a virus is generally defined as a code segmentin an otherwise normal program which when executed, seeks to propagate itselfinto some other uninfected program; it has the potential to spread byreplication and its action is covert.andP;  A &quot;worm&quot;, on the other hand, whilealso covert, usually exists as a program in its own right, tending to spreadover networks via electronic mail).andP;  At the moment personal computers are themain target of viruses because there are so many of them - therefore a virusis likely to spread; the vast majority of personal computers use the MS-DOSoperating system which does not have any facilities to isolate user processesfrom system resources - programs are consequently at liberty to behave asthey like; personal computers do not have physical and logical accesscontrols typical of mainframe computer systems; and lastly personal computerusers are not often technically trained and so are not adept at implementingcontrols and safeguards.andP;  Apple Computer Inc machines have been targeted forthe same reasons.andP;  It also seems likely that the IBM AS/400 and small DECVAXs will soon become virus targets as well.andP;  Jacobson, however, is aconnoisseur of MS-DOS personal computer viruses - the number of which, heclaims, has grown from one in 1986 to 19 by last April.andP;  Furthermore, virusesare getting subtler and more insidious, and are increasingly being used as ahighly unethical business tool.andP;  For example, viruses have been discoveredthat latched onto the software of several vendors but did not infect that ofone specific vendor.andP;  Aside from attacking the products of competitors,viruses have been used to attack files and programs of a rival within anorganisation, scramble the data of an accounting system to delay thediscovery of a fraud; or to trigger system crashes to create a demand for theperpetrator's technical recovery services.andM;The insidious methods of infiltrationandM;Viruses can be introduced into a personal computer in a variety ofandM;ways: through the installation and execution of infected software, frombooting using a floppy disk with an infected boot track record, via datafloppies without a ROM code that are left in the A drive while the personalcomputer is re-booted, or by the DOS FDISK.COM program entering informationinto a partition record.andP;  A variety of safeguards against viruses werediscussed at the seminar, the most popular solution being permanent statusrecords with suitable audit trails to detect viruses and help in both therecovery from and investigation into the infection.andP;  Anti-viral disks metwith a mixed response on several counts: firstly they tend to slow down thecomputer, as well as hindering any innovative use of computing; secondly,viruses are rapidly developed to circumvent the latest cure.andP;  Jan Hruska ofSophos Ltd suggested that all companies should have a &quot;dirty&quot; personalcomputer for employees to play games on and for using bulletin board software- David Frost of Price Waterhouse felt this was a far too lenient approachand advocated instant dismissal for anyone using non-corporate software.andO;Whichever strategy is chosen data hygiene and responsible management wouldappear to be the best cure-alls on offer at the moment.andM;Redress under the law is doubtfulandM;Once a viral infection is identified and the perpetrator isandM;known one would assume the law would be able to take its course.andP;  In fact asbarrister Alistair Kelman made clear it is legally very difficult toprosecute the &quot;information terrorist&quot;.andP;  Firstly, under the Criminal DamageAct of 1977, damage has to be of a &quot;tangible nature&quot; - viruses, however,cause things to happen without necessarily tangibly damaging either thehardware or the disk itself.andP;  Consequently, if you are subject to a virusmake sure the indictment is very carefully drawn up.andP;  Secondly, ifprosecution is sought under the civil liability of the escape of a dangerousthing, a judge is not likely to believe that computer viruses can be likenedto smoke, gas and floodwater.andP;  Furthermore, under the defence of &quot;act ofstranger&quot; a defendant can claim that a third party was liable, and sinceviruses are normally introduced by third parties, this defence will beavailable to everyone except the viral source who is unlikely to have anyassets to be seized in compensation.andP;  The best line of prosecution to followis that of negligence against, say, an engineer who did not follow strictdata hygiene.andP;  This type of prosecution is likely to provide licensed usersof software some compensation - users of pirated versions of software,however, beware you have no property rights in the software and, therefore,no legal grounds for redress.andP;
