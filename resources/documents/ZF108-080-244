(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>FACILITIES MANAGEMENT: HOW STRONG IS THE TIE WITH CAD?andM;Facilities managers themselves will admit that theirs is not a glamorous job.andO;And for vendors of computer-aided design systems, the market is frustrating.andM;That's partly because facilities management is last in line, and isolated.andO;After the designers have designed, and the builders have built, after thedoors are hung and office modules installed, after cables have been snaked inthe overheads and the lights at last turned on, that's when facilitiesmanagement starts.andM;That late start, and the relationship it defines to other operations, createsthe frustration for CAD vendors.andP;  There's a hole in the market -- between thegraphics requirements of facilities designers and the inventory controlrequirements of facilities managers.andM;SeparationandM;blocks savingsandM;There's a powerful irony here.andP;  Assets which facilities managers watch overcan be a big piece of whaths listed on their companies' balance sheets.andP;  Thesavings of integrating CAD and FM could be substantial.andP;  But this separationof job function -- and corporate reporting structure, and job skills, andpersonality types -- blocks the achievement of the economies of integration.andM;This split of job function and automation requirements is exacerbated by thespecialization of third party firms.andP;  Some architectural firms also havefacilities management divisions, but not many.andP;  Some property developers havemanagement subsidiaries, but not many.andP;  Some developers and property firmshave internal design groups, but not many.andM;Instead, when a facilities manager has a design requirement -- new peoplecoming in, a division relocating, reshuffling after a layoff -- the design(or redesign) work still tends to get farmed out to an architectural or spaceplanning firm.andM;Design work getsandM;farmed outandM;&quot;It's good for us,&quot; notes Jim Hammon, an architect with Cambridge-basedByrer/Architects, &quot;because we get a lot of redesign work for propertymanagers that don't have the CAD skills themselves.andP;  So far most of ourcustomers are comfortable with this.&quot;andM;He notes, however, one of the trends relating to closing this market hole.andO;&quot;A lot more, however, are looking for compatibility between our CAD systemsand their facilities management systems.andP;  This can give us problems whenwe're on a Macintosh and they're on an MSDOS machine.&quot;andM;In short, the market seems to be trending toward a handshake rather than anembrace between CAD and FM.andP;  But there are variations:andM;Data is FMandM;primary needandM;* Marc Margulies, president of Margulies andamp; Associates, a company thatprovides design and specification services for developers and facilitiesmanagers, and past president of the International Facilities ManagementAssociation, notes that some of the FM suppliers have taken matters intotheir own hand.andP;  &quot;Some of the office furniture vendors will provide, alongwith information on their products, applications software that runs under CADsystems and allows you to output equipment schedules and purchase orders fromthe CAD design,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;I still see,&quot; he goes on, &quot;however, that theprimary need of facilities managers is for the data, not the graphics,associated with the physical plant.andP;  The facilities managers and the leasingpeople and the designers may want to share data, but they don't necessarilywant to work on an integrated system.&quot;andM;Managers doandM;their own CADandM;* On the other hand, a number of facilities managers are buying CAD systemsthemselves.andP;  &quot;The price threshold has lowered enough,&quot; notes Michael Schley,president of FM: Systems, a company that provides automation and designconsulting to facilities managers, &quot;that I'm seeing a sudden rush on the partof facilities managers and planners to install their own CAD systems.andP;  Ofcourse there also seems to be an increase in the general pace of automationin facilities management.andP;  In the long run I think we'll get to the pointwhere facilities managers will use these systems in much the way geographicinformation systems are used -- to visualize their space systems for planningand simulation.&quot;andM;Integration byandM;corporate fiatandM;* In some cases the facilities design and management functions are beingintegrated from above.andP;  At Digital Equipment, for instance, regionalfacilities design groups are being integrated both with other regional groupsand with the facilities management groups -- primarily through theimplementation of a more comprehensive CAD/FM tool (in this case McDonnellDouglas' Graphic Design System).andP;  While the individual groups have tended tooperate separately in the past, the company has seen the pay-off in closerties between the two functions.andM;Vendors seekandM;more integrationandM;* FM vendors are aligning themselves with CAD vendors.andP;  For example, theComputer-Aided Design Group, of Marina Del Rey, CA, a vendor of FM packagesfor mainframes and minicomputers, has begun distributing an applicationmodule that works with AutoCAD through AutoCAD dealers.andP;  &quot;While we still seea lot of need for the standalone FM systems that deliver the data to themanagers,&quot; says Scott Brown, PC Product Manager at CADG, &quot;we see a marketopportunity in accommodating the large base of PCs running CAD.andP;  We also seeincreasing demand, by the way, coming from growing personnel change rates.andO;In general the personnel movement rate is now around 30% a year; in someindustries, like aerospace, it can get over 100%.andP;  These managers need theCAD in their daily work.&quot;andM;What does all this say for the market?andM;Mostly that it still has holes in it: the FM community is too amorphous to beeasy pickings.andP;  That is, the likely buyers of FM products are spread across alarge spectrum of company types -- from developers and architects to officesupply companies and any company with a few million dollars worth offacilities -- and are numerous.andP;  Nor do facilities managers generally commandhuge budgets or significant status in their companies.andM;&quot;The contraction of the computer industry in the Northeast recently has givenus new business in redesign for downsizing and space relocation,&quot; remarksMargulies.andP;  &quot;This can often entail as much or more design work as newbuilding, since current equipment must be conserved.andP;  And often after adownsizing there are less people in the facilities management functionanyway.&quot;andM;Accommodation,andM;not fullandM;integrationandM;So the market is likely to stay on the following tack:andM;* FM software vendors will continue to add application hooks to theirpackages to allow them to use CAD data.andM;* CAD vendors will continue to offer FM modules that work with their systemsand increasingly support third party applications that run on their software.andM;* The continuing fall in PC prices will keep the trend toward using PCs andworkstations as the primary FM hardware platform.andP;  For that matter, asignificant amount of FM is still done manually or using Lotus 1-2-3.andM;* The integration of functions associated with FM -- space planning,inventory control, moves and change documentation, stacking and blocking,lease allocations and billing, etc.andP;  -- will remain largely unrealized.andP;  Dataand file sharing, however, will increase to the point where integrationceases to be a goal.andP;  What true integration there is will probably follow theintegration of data bases.andM;Sharing theandM;data: key toandM;mergerandM;In this last point may be the secret to the real suturing of the splitbetween what the facilities manager needs and what the designer needs: database tools.andP;  With relational data bases and (soon) object oriented data basesde rigeur in the market and falling in price, the possibility of differentapplications easily sharing the same data on a facility's design,configuration, inventory, and business characteristics becomes much greater.andO;As long as it's the same data, does it matter that a facilities manager caresto look at it differently from a leasing manager different from a spaceplanner?andM;With the total 1989 market for AEC CAD at $1.7 billion, and FM a subsetsomewhere under 10% of that, according to Kathey Hale, an industry analystwith Dataquest, the market is still probably underandM;$100 million for graphics-based FM.andP;  Given its aftermarket status in the CADworld, however, it could be growing at double digits and still not benoticed.andM;Software leadsandM;growth curveandM;While the overall AEC CAD market is growing at 9%, the software portion isgrowing at 16%.andP;  With the FM market still relatively unpenetrated bygraphics-based software, a double-digit growth rate is not at allunreasonable.andM;&quot;There's still a lot of market education to go,&quot; says Hale, &quot;but smaller andsmaller sites are lining up for automation to help them deal with moves,changes, and redesigns.&quot;andP;  While Hale goes on to note that it's not clear howmuch of that automation entails graphics, it seems in keeping with the trendtoward computer graphics in general that a good bit of it might.andM;For the sale of the vendors one hopes so.andM;And for the sake of facilities managers one hopes doubly so.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
