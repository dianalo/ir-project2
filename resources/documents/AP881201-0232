Chairman L. William Seidman said in a speech Wednesday at theNational Press Club.   ``Once these 100 or so worst institutions are liquidated, theother problem institutions can be dealt with over a somewhat longerperiod,'' he said, outlining the conclusions of an FDIC study thatwill be published within two weeks.   Seidman joins former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, andCongress' General Accounting Office, in arguing that it will becheaper in the long run to spend heavily now to close failingsavings and loan institutions.   His recommendation is an implicit criticism of the approach takenso far by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which istechnically insolvent and lacks the cash to pay off depositors ormake good on all Sandamp;L losses.   So far this year, FSLIC has ``resolved'' the cases of 147 Sandamp;Ls,most through rescues put together with guarantees and promissorynotes committing money it does not have now but expects to receiveover the next 30 years.   Seidman, whose agency insures deposits in commercial banks, notSandamp;Ls, said he does not oppose allowing an institution to remain openif it is economically viable, but that the losses should be cleanedup immediately and not allowed to continue.   ``He's saying that they should have had more money and theyshould have closed more institutions,'' said Mark J. Riedy,president of the National Council of Savings Institutions, a tradegroup.   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for M. Danny Wall, chairman of theFederal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's 3,000Sandamp;Ls, said, ``All we can do is play with the hand we've been dealtand that hand provides us with certain resources. ... This Congressand this administration have to determine where we go from here.''   Seidman did not directly call for a taxpayer bailout, but said``government resources'' must be used because even the first $30billion of what is estimated to be a $50 billion to $100 billionproblem is beyond the capacity of the Sandamp;L industry to pay.   However, he said several methods could be used to keep most ofthe FSLIC rescue ``off budget,'' providing a large sum quickly butspreading the fiscal drain over several years. One method involvesselling bonds and having the Treasury pay the interest.   But James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League ofSavings Institutions, the largest industry lobby group, said even ifthe bank board received $30 billion next year, it would be difficultto spend it efficiently.   ``I have a question as to whether they can move that quickly,''he said. ``It would be wonderful if they could, but I'm notconvinced.''   The FDIC also examined the broader issue of deposit insurance.Both the FDIC and the FSLIC guarantee deposits up to $100,000.Seidman said deposit insurance is needed because it prevents bankruns that could bring down the entire financial system.   Suggestions from academics that deposit insurance be scrapped orreduced are impractical, Seidman said, but he offered several ideasto keep the government's liabilities from mounting:   _Taking deposit insurance agencies out of the federal budget sothey are less subject to political pressure.   _Giving the insurance funds the power to raise the fee charged tomember institutions after bad years and, eventually, perhaps thepower to charge individual institutions different fees based ontheir records.   _Speeding up the process for revoking an institution's insurancefrom two years to six months.   _Making solvent banks owned by holding companies responsible forthe losses of other banks held by the same parent.   _Establishing regional committees of regulators and bankers toevaluate whether institutions are overly exposed to risk in oneregion or one sector of the economy, such as oil drilling.</TEXT></DOC>
