<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-0276 </DOCNO><TEXT>We present some results of dual frequency resonant magnet excitation atfull power using the old NINA synchrotron dipoles. These tests will simulatea typical resonant cell as proposed for the accelerating rings of theTRIUMF KAON Factory. These tests have two main purposes: to verify circuitparameters and component ratings for the dual frequency resonant powersupply system; to directly measure electrical losses in a transversemagnet field, such as eddy current losses in magnet conductors, vacuumtubes and core losses in laminations. This data will be required forthe detailed design of the accelerator system components. 1 ref., 9 figs.,1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
