 At first, All-in-1 required toomuch resource and management for the cost efficiency small systems usersdemanded.andM;Gradually, and in response to specific criticisms from users of All-in-1, DEChas brought the product closer to the end user, ending up with the arrival ofAll-in-1 Desktop for MS-DOS.andP;  This will enable PC users to make full use ofAll-in-1's systems and services, and is part of a DEC development strategy:All-in-1 Phase II.andM;The launch of All-in-1 Phase II is the next step in DEC's bid to increase its48 per cent share in the office automation systems market, and implements thecompany's NAS (Networking Applications Support) strategy.andP;  Girish Naik, UKproduct marketing manager for DEC office automation systems, explains thereasoning behind the decision to migrate to desktops.andP;  He estimates thatAll-in-1 has more than 3-1/2 million customers, half of them connected to thesystem through desktop Pcs.andP;  At the moment, PC users can only accessAll-in-1's facilities through terminal emulation.andP;  But this is slow andlimited in terms of applications.andM;So why should users want to integrate with All-in-1?andP;  Firstly it can't befaulted in theory: people have been waiting for a customizable, menu-orientedsoftware product that provides office applications and networkingcapabilities.andP;  But Steve Ritchie, senior consultant at Braxxon Technology,believes, &quot;It can quickly turn into a hungry giant that eats up machineresources if used wrongly.&quot;andM;Realizing that many people wanted to introduce office technology into theirorganization but couldn't afford it, DEC rethought its strategy.andP;  The resultwas All-in-1 Starter, a set of basic cabinet management and system managementutilities.andP;  All-in-1 Starter was aimed at small systems managers, the costwas 50 per cent less than a full All-in-1 system, and it could be upgraded.andO;This not only protected the customer's investment, it also created morerevenue for DEC.andM;With Phase I bringing All-in-1 closer to the end user, Phase II will extendAll-in-1 into the realms of client/server computing and bring advanced officeapplications to a variety of PC environments.andP;  At the same time, DEC hasextended All-in-1 to encompass a whole family of products, including All-in-1Desktop for MS-DOS and All-in-1 Mail for MS-DOS (which runs on all MS-DOS PCssupported by DECnet).andP;  Girish Naik describes Phase II as &quot;the first steptowards an object-oriented interface for desktop publishing&quot;.andM;Phase II architecture incorporates an All-in-1 server which will provide NASapplications and services.andP;  NAS is a software environment allowingapplications to share information across a network, regardless of whichsystem runs the applications.andP;  It seems an important development, as it maydeliver a unified software environment for the 1990s.andM;All-in-1 Desktop for MS-DOS is a menu-oriented software product that willallow MS-DOS-based PC users to work within the All-in-1 environment, and canbe customized to users' requirements.andP;  Naik says that DEC's aim was notsimply to provide access to All-in-1 applications, but also to use theintelligence of desktop PCs.andM;Phase II will allow users to choose their own applications, desktop andvendor.andP;  Users will be able to access All-in-1's features as well as theirown PC applications, and will automatically become part of a worldwidecommunications network.andM;All-in-1 Desktop will enhance, not replace, the PC user's current workingenvironment by using desktop services to access network-based information andresources.andP;  PC applications won't need to be rewritten, and DEC claimscentralized management of desktops and data control will reduce managementsystem costs.andM;The additional provision of electronic mail means that PC users will have anelectronic briefcase.andP;  Those with laptops will be able to get messages fromthe server system, disconnect the PC and answer from their current location.andO;Mail can then be sent back over a phone link.andM;In the word processing option, users have a choice: they can use the editoron the server or the PC (response is better on the latter, says Naik).andO;Documents and messages can be stored in File Cabinet.andM;When All-in-1 Desktop for MS-DOS comes out in March, it will initially beavailable for DEC VAXmate and DECstations 210, 316 and 320; IBM PC, XT, ATand PS/2 models.andP;  Later on in the year, DEC aims to provide All-in-1integration for Macintosh and OS/2 applications.andM;At 160 pound sterling per single user licence (45 pound sterling for All-in-1Mail), All-in-1 for MS-DOS could be attractive to users who need itsfacilities -- advanced office applications and links to company-widenetworks.andP;  But it would be uneconomical for basic word processing anddocument storage.andM;DEC says future developments and enhancements will depend on customerrequirements.andP;  &quot;Customers come to us and say 'Can you do this?andP;  Can you dothat?'.andP;  We listen to their suggestions,&quot; claims Naik.andP;  He foresees acontinuing focus on PC integration, and this would widen PC users' choice ofthe platforms to which they can connect.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
