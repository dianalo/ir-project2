WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An East German economic recovery like the onethat transformed war-ravaged West Germany into one of the world'srichest nations, hangs on the fate of a crudely minted,featherweight coin.   East Germany's aluminum Ostmark is non-convertible abroad andquickly losing its value at home due to a dearth of goods and afree fall on illegal exchange markets.   West German financial experts consider currency reform to be acrucial first step toward a convertible Ostmark and economicrecovery.   But even the most committed reformers in the communist statehave so far resisted the idea of forcing a nation nurtured onsocialist promises of security to endure the draconian transitionto a currency of real value.   East Germans have $84 billion stashed in savings banks _ theequivalent of more than $5,000 for every man, woman and child inthe nation.   That poses a massive threat of inflation, as well testifying toa chronic lack of anything desireable to buy in East Germany.   Price controls have to be removed or drastically reduced tobring the cost of goods in line with the cost of their production,economists on both sides agree. But prices would skyrocket if statecontrols were lifted while so much cash is at the ready.   Western economists therefore recommend a currency reform, orreplacement of the long-disdained Ostmarks with a new currency thatpeople will respect.   ``Whatever else needs to be done hinges on a currency reform,''said Liane Launhardt, a senior economist with West Germany'sCommerzbank. ``We feel it is pivotal for introducing marketeconomic elements and getting important projects off the ground.''   She described the move as ``bitter potion that no one in EastGermany wants to swallow,'' but like other Western economists saidwidespread unrest will be unleashed if runaway inflation resultsfrom attempted half-measures.   ``How soon a currency reform could be implemented depends on howlong it takes to accept economic reform as the way out of thecurrent crisis,'' said Norbert Walter, spokesman for Deutsche Bank,West Germany's largest financial institution.   Deutsche Bank President Alfred Herrhausen predicts East Germanscould enjoy the same living standards as West Germany in five to 10years if they quickly come to grips with the nationwide sacrificesneeded in the interim.   West Germany's post-war recovery was achieved in large partbecause of the 1948 currency reform that replaced the inflatedReichmarks with Deutschmarks at a rate of 10-1.   The measure immediately infused confidence in the currency andput an end to the ``cigarette economy,'' where food and othernecessities were valued in American tobacco.   But it devastated the personal wealth of most Germans in theoccupied Western sectors and inflicted harsh sacrifice on thosewithout property and other tangible assets.   The East German government is not prepared to wipe out privatecash reserves deliberately, said Finance Ministry spokesman FranzKoeckerbauer.   ``We don't consider it necessary,'' he said. ``We are trying toencourage citizens to have confidence in the financial system, andsuch measures would run counter to that aim.''   East Germany's new finance minister, Uta Nickel, has likewisebrushed off Western suggestions that subsidies be drasticallyreduced in the transition to market-related pricing.   ``Changes to the practice of subsidies must be considered withall caution,'' Ms. Nickel told the labor newspaper Tribuene.``Everyone is now criticizing the subsidies, as if they hadn't beenenjoying them for years.''   The views being expressed by East German and West Germaneconomists on the need for currency reform reflect the sensitivepolitical situation complicating recovery.   Communists have held power since the East German state wasfounded in the Soviet-occupied sector of defeated Germany in 1949,and to suddenly advocate measures undertaken by West Germany fourdecades ago would be tantamount to an admission of political errors.   The Communists face challenges to their continued rule both fromunrecognized opposition movements and from the smaller politicalparties they have been aligned with for 40 years.   East Germany needs a new and more-secure political system inplace before it can seriously tackle economic measures of themagnitude of a currency reform and convertibility, according toManfred Milzer of the West Berlin-based German Institute forEconomic Research.   But time is running against restraint, especially since EastGermans have been allowed to travel freely to the West.   Untold thousands have smuggled out their excess currency andtraded it as low as 20 Ostmarks to one West German mark, floodingthe illegal market to the point that free traders will no longerbuy the East German currency at any price.   Jochen Zimmermann, head of Berliner Bank's foreign exchangedivision, said estimates run as high as $1.6 billion on the amountof East German currency traded illegally in the West by touristswanting funds for weekend shopping sprees.   Ms. Nickel, the finance minister, has proposed a value of 4.4Ostmarks per West German mark as an internal conversion rate toprovide tourists with travel money.   But no realistic rate has been mentioned in East Berlin as atarget for eventual convertibility to hard currencies.   Internal reforms, like replacement of the Ostmark, are viewed asnecessary to even start aiming for conversion, said Berliner Bank'sZimmermann.   Noting that initial West German offers of assistance have beenrebuffed as interference, Zimmermann said a convertible currency is``clearly a long way off.''</TEXT></DOC>
