Mr. David, a former attorney at the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison, agreed to settle civil charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission Dec. 10.    Such settlements usually get rubber-stamp approval from the court. But District Judge David N. Edelstein has so far balked at the plan, saying it doesn't provide any sanctions in the event Mr. David misses a required payment. The settlement, he told the SEC at a hearing yesterday, should have more &quot;teeth.&quot;    Under the tentative settlement, Mr. David agreed to pay, over 11 years, $50,000 in returned profits derived from insider trading and an additional penalty of as much as $100,000, depending on his income over the time period. However, the judge said he wanted to be able to hold Mr. David in contempt of court and demand immediate payment of the money if he defaults. If found in contempt of court, Mr. David could be thrown in jail.    So under a compromise plan being drawn up by SEC lawyers, Mr. David now could be ordered, if he misses a payment, to pay the $50,000 in returned profits immediately, not over 11 years, if ordered by the judge.    The SEC said the problem with approving the settlement has been complicated by the $100,000 penalty, which isn't a firm amount but is only a maximum figure depending on Mr. David's future earnings. Judge Edelstein originally wanted to be able to demand all $150,000 if Mr. David defaults, but the SEC pointed out the $100,000 couldn't be demanded immediately, because it is only a ceiling amount that depends on Mr. David's income.    As for the delay, Carmen Lawrence, the SEC attorney handling the case, said the court &quot;usually defers to the commission's judgment&quot; as to what is adequate, though &quot;it really does depend on the judge.&quot; Mr. David's lawyer, Darrell K. Fennell, said the delay was surprising, but declined to comment further.    (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: Michael David&quot; -- WSJ Dec. 22, 1986) </TEXT></DOC>
