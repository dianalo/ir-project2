Texaco back to Texas yesterday. They told their colleagues in the Texas courts to decide how big a bond Texaco must post to appeal Pennzoil's $11 billion judgment. In essence the Supreme Court yesterday gave Texas one last chance to fix the mess it's created.    After losing at trial in Texas, Texaco was faced with posting an $12 billion bond to appeal the ruling because the state requires a bond equal to the damage award. Texaco knew Judge Solomon Casseb Jr. had botched the jury instructions and was confident that in time a court would come to its rescue. But posting a $12 billion bond would cripple its normal operations and might mean bankruptcy. Instead of asking the Texas courts to set aside the bond requirement, Texaco went into federal court, invoking the constitutional issue of due process. Its claim was that if the bond stood, it might not be in business long enough to appeal. A New York federal court lowered the bond to $1 billion, and the Second Circuit agreed.    The Supreme Court overturned these decisions, saying that Texaco must ask the Texas courts to waive the bond before coming to the federal courts for help. Texaco can ask the federal courts for help only when it runs out of appeals in Texas. The legal reasoning is surprising because it's been so long since the high court based a holding on states' rights.    The fact is that the opinion signed by five justices has an easily deciphered message that is aimed squarely at the Texas justices: &quot;The Texas courts may well accept Texaco's challenge on state constitutional grounds, obviating the need for consideration of the federal constitutional issues.&quot; Hint, hint. Translation: &quot;We're not saying Texas must relieve Texaco of the bond, but that's the only sure way for the state's judicial system to save face.&quot;    Some of the concurring opinions went further. Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, felt obliged to launch a broadside against economic civil rights. They claimed that &quot;the underlying issues in this case -- arising from a commercial dispute -- do not involve fundamental constitutional rights.&quot; Texaco raised the due process, equal protection and full faith and credit clauses, which last we looked were rights granted everyone, including corporations. Texaco also won't be encouraged by several justices' statements that trustees in bankruptcy can always file the appeal.    Texaco shares fell $4 yesterday to Pennzoil's advance of $6.875. It's unclear whether Pennzoil will demand the full bond or put liens on Texaco property. No one knows how quickly the Texas courts will respond to Texaco's appeal of the bond, or how they will eventually rule. There is only one ray of light for Texaco: It has the best of the arguments on the merits.    The Supreme Court avoided the key issue: Did Pennzoil have a legally binding contract to buy Getty before Texaco stole away the bride? As we've written, Judge Casseb massacred the common law when he held that Pennzoil's agreement in principle &quot;subject to a definitive merger agreement&quot; with Getty was the same thing as a legally binding agreement.    Our lay opinion is in good company. Judge Casseb himself has since admitted he probably misinterpreted New York contract law, which applies in the case. Federal Judge Charles Brieant called the award &quot;so absurd, so impractical and so expensive that it hardly bears discussion.&quot; He said any damages would be in the $500 million range. Earlier this month, Seventh Circuit Judge Frank Easterbrook dismissed a similar case on summary judgment, emphasizing that in inherently complex transactions like mergers &quot;the parties should be able to choose with precision the point at which they can no longer back out.&quot;    All eyes are now upon Texas. Texaco already has appealed the merits of the case to the state Supreme Court. The justices can save themselves the embarrassment of review by federal courts if they do now what Judge Casseb should have done two years ago. They could take judicial notice of the fact that another state's law applies and &quot;certify&quot; the case as one for New York courts.    Even if the bond requirement remains, Texaco's creditors would breathe a sigh of relief if they knew that New York courts would finally get the chance to apply New York law. The Texas courts should act quickly, though, before the state is blamed for allowing a bond rule to pitch the nation's fifth-largest corporation into bankruptcy. </TEXT></DOC>
