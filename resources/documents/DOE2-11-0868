As a result, various attempts have been madeto improve the performance of reciprocating, rotary, scroll, screw, andturbo compressor types, and these compressors are now beginning to beselectively used according to the specific application so as to takeadvantage of the characteristics of the various compressors. In addition,evaluations are being made of capacity control through changes made inthe number of rotations, the use of refrigerant mixtures, and interactionbetween refrigerating oil and refrigerant, so as to improve performanceas regards general operation, reliability, and control in cases in whichan entire air conditioning and refrigeration system, including compressors,is considered as a system. With regard to positive-displacement typerefrigerant compressors, the authors, in the present report, have investigatedthe research that has been published recently and have tried to identifytrends.</TEXT></DOC>
