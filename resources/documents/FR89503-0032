As part of the 1984 DPG modernization program, the Army proposed constructionand operation of two biological testing facilities, the BATF and the LSL.Both facilities were to be constructed and operated in compliance withthe National Institutes of Health/Centers for Disease Control (NIH/CDC)biosafety guidelines; the BATF was to be constructed to biosafety levelfour (BL-4) and operated at BL-3 standards while the LSL was to be constructedand operated at BL-3 and BL-2 standards. 2. In September 1988 the Army announced as its preferred alternative, BATFconstruction and operation at BL-3. Since the LSL was planned for BL-3,this allowed consolidation of the LSL and BATF to be considered. An economicanalysis concluded it would be cost effective to construct a combined LSLand BATF in one building. Consolidation would contribute to savings bydecreased maintenance, operational, and instrumentation costs. 3. The Army therefore, in accordance with The National Environmental PolicyAct, proposes to consider construction and operation of this consolidatedbiological test facility, the Life Science Laboratory, as an additionalalternative to those considered in the existing BATF DEIS. The LSL wouldinclude aerosol test capabilities proposed for the BATF. All operationswould be at the BL-3 level. Combining LSL and BATF activities would notresult in variation from BL-3 requirements or any different activitiesthan would have been conducted in two separate facilities. 4. The Army gives notice that a Supplement to the BATF DEIS, a more comprehensivedocument than existing LSL environmental documentation, will be preparedand published. This Supplemental DEIS will address the alternative of consolidatingproposed BATF operations, equipment and construction into the proposedLSL. 5. A public notice of the availability of the Supplement for review andcomment will be announced with details of a planned public hearing. Questionsand comments regarding this NOI should be addressed to Commander, U.S.Army Dugway Proving Ground, ATTN: STEDP-PA (Ms. Kathy Whitaker), Dugway,Utah, 84022-5000.<ITAG tagnum="34">April 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lewis D.
