In the Sixties and Seventies, scientistsand environmentalists urged us to consider these global impacts in theconduct of everyday life and coined the slogan &quot;Think Globally - ActLocally.&quot; Now in the Eighties, the slogan is re-emerging, but this timewith an appreciation of the need for deeper analysis. This paper discussesthe concrete, day-to-day benefits of international regulations, the specificroles that local officials and interest groups play in developing successfulinternational solutions. It also depicts the creative reciprocal flowof ideas and experiences between international and local actors. A varietyof examples illustrate the mutual interplay of international law andlocal policy. State and local groups influence the acceptance of internationallynegotiated solutions; they also directly benefit from the protectionsafforded under the international rules. Even though international solutionsmandate added local responsibilities in some instances, localities havebegun to appreciate the impact of international law, and no longer seeit as distance, abstract, and inconsequential. Similarly, internationalforums have continued to develop an appreciation for, and draw upon,the hard-won expertise of local officials and interest groups.</TEXT></DOC>
