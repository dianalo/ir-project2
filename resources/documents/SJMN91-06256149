Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., would pay forsupercomputing programs at several agencies, led by the National ScienceFoundation and the National Air and Space Museum, and would financedevelopment of the switching systems and software necessary to link thecomputers through high-speed information &quot;highways.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SENATE OKS $1 BILLION FOR NETWORK  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;This is one of the most significant advances in this country's ability tocompete that we've had in a long, long time,&quot; Gore said. &quot;This will enable usto leapfrog the Japanese and make the best use of an area in which we hold atenuous advantage.&quot;;   A similar measure has already passed the House, but theBush administration has expressed concerns about the legislation. Whileadministration officials say the bill is &quot;generally consistent&quot; with their ownproposals, they object to a number of provisions that detail how theadministration should coordinate the activities of different agencies and setpriorities.;   The Senate bill would also instruct the government to develop a&quot;national research and education network&quot; that would allow researchers atuniversities and private research centers to tap into high-speed computingcenters thousands of miles away.;   But the bulk of the money would be spenton research into the equipment and software necessary to coordinatecommunication with supercomputers, which can handle data at speeds as high asa billion bits a second, thousands of times faster than personal computers.;  Passage of Wednesday's measure followed a compromise worked out earlier thisyear over who would have control over the new program. Lawmakers on the SenateEnergy Committee wanted to put the Energy Department in charge, while Gorewanted to give responsibility to the National Science Foundation.;   In thecompromise, two-thirds of the money would be spent through the science agency,but responsibility for the overall network would be left to an interagencygroup in the White House.;   Supercomputers can handle extremely complextasks, like predicting the airflow over the wing of a new jet fighter,predicting long-term weather patterns and designing new drugs molecule bymolecule.;   The new measure would allocate $650 million to the NationalScience Foundation, $388 million to the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration and $31 million to the National Institute for Standards andTechnology.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910912  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  402  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, September 12, 199100256149,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
