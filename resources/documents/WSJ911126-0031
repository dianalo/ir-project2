They canearn $9 a month if they get a fitness evaluation and follow aprescribed exercise plan -- and $12 monthly ($144 a year) ifthey do both programs.   &quot;What we're doing is paying people to become nonsmokersand to be more conscious about nutrition and exercise,&quot; saysJoanne Ciconte, assistant vice president and benefitsmanager.   Hay Group calls the incentives the &quot;next frontier inhealth cost control.&quot; Nine percent of the 1,053 companiespolled this year in the consulting firm's annual benefitssurvey offer financial rewards to entice employees intohealthy living -- be it reduced premiums or co-payments onthe company's health plan, or cold cash. The trend is so newthat this is the first year it was included on the survey.   &quot;I think we're going to see some fairly dramatic growth inthis area over the next couple of years,&quot; says MichaelCarter, the Hay Group's senior vice president. Employers have&quot;tried everything else, and it hasn't worked. This makessense.&quot;   But to skeptics, the good-health bounties are bothillogical and unfair. &quot;If you give $150 to people to put onDanskins and go to jazzercize class, is that really anincentive to&quot; a single mother who barely has time to grab aMcDonald's hamburger on her way home from work? asks HarryHarrington, director of the National Health ManagementFoundation, a nonprofit entity of Blue Shield of CaliforniaGroup.   &quot;A good deal of evidence suggests that much obesity isgenetic,&quot; adds Kenneth Warner, a health economist at theUniversity of Michigan. &quot;Are you going to punish people forhaving a genetic problem?&quot;   Nevertheless, incentives are &quot;one of the hottest areastoday in the field of health promotion,&quot; says John Riedel,national marketing manager of Blue Shield of California.&quot;This is a real crossroads in the field of health promotion.It puts teeth into it.&quot;   The theory is that a healthy employee is not only cheaper-- saving a company thousands of dollars in medical costs --but also more productive. Ms. Ciconte, a creator of the Bankof Delaware &quot;Wellness Money&quot; program, says the cash carrothas gotten her to ride an exercise bike for half an hour aday, five days a week. As a result, she says, longtime painin her knee has disappeared -- and with it numerous trips tothe doctor and piles of medical bills.   The concept started with smoking. Since 1988 the state ofKansas has knocked $10 off employees' monthly healthinsurance premiums if they pledge not to smoke for a year.Now, a growing number of companies are offering similardiscounts contingent on promises to strive for health inother areas, such as cholesterol counts, blood pressure andweight.   At Adolph Coors Co. in Golden, Colo., employees can opt toanswer a 105-question &quot;health hazard appraisal.&quot; If they'rerated low-risk or agree to address their problems, thecompany will pick up an extra 5% of their health insurancepremium.   Southern California Edison employees who meet standardsfor weight, blood pressure (below 140 over 90), cholesterol(below 240) and blood sugar (below 200 milligrams perdeciliter without fasting) and whose lungs show less thaneight parts of carbon monoxide per million receive a$10-a-month rebate on health insurance. Those who pledge towork on their problem areas also get the money.   Company officials are confident that the investment willpay off. The average health bill for employees with no riskfactors in 1989 was $1,273; for employees with a risk inthree of the areas, it was $2,284, according to JacqueSokolov, the giant utility company's medical director.   Sometimes efforts to encourage good health habits comeacross not as incentives but as penalties. Texas Instrumentsrecently decided to charge employees and their dependents $10a month for health insurance (up to a monthly maximum of $30a family) if they use any form of tobacco, including chewingtobacco. Until then no employee had paid for healthinsurance.   The company instituted the measure after an internal studyshowed that smokers were costing 50% more in health claimsthan nonsmokers. This year Texas Instruments expects to spend$4.5 million for smoking-related health claims by its U.S.employees.   Insurance companies are picking up on the incentives idea.The Healthy Virginian plan available from Blue Cross and BlueShield of Virginia gives a 40% discount to beneficiarieswhose smoking, drinking, auto-seat-belt use and exercise areat acceptable levels.   Blue Cross executives acknowledge that they can't be sureapplicants are being truthful when they answer questionsabout their health habits, but they say &quot;certain things willgive themselves away.&quot; If a beneficiary files claims for achronic cough, the company might check to see if the personreally is a nonsmoker. Beneficiaries who say they don't drinkmuch and then injure themselves in a drunk-driving accidentmight be denied coverage after the fact, an executive says.   Aetna Life andamp; Casualty is developing a policy with a fewlarge clients that would reduce premiums for beneficiarieswho get checkups once a year. One client, Crum andamp; ForsterCorp., a property casualty insurer in Basking Ridge, N.J.,expects to offer its employees a plan next year that wouldgrant a large discount to people who draw up personal healthgoals with their doctors and then meet them.   But as the concept expands, it raises more questions ofprivacy, biology and fairness. &quot;The problem with risk factorsis it's usually not spread evenly among socioeconomicgroups,&quot; says Mr. Harrington of the National HealthManagement Foundation. Research shows that lower incomepeople are more likely to smoke and eat high fat diets, hesays. &quot;Are we ultimately coming to decisions in health carethat will come to killing the sick, blaming the victim forbecoming sick?&quot;   Such arguments flared recently in Delaware, where thestate's insurance committee voted to include premiumdifferentials for healthy workers in the state's health plan.The union representing mostly lower-paid state employeessuccessfully blocked the plan, saying its membership smokesin greater proportion but can least afford the differential.   That, argues Delaware's insurance commissioner, DavidLevinson, is just why such incentives are needed. &quot;Smallfinancial incentives will work only if you need that money,&quot;he said in a recent speech. &quot;This is why financial incentivesin the health insurance system are so important today -- tomodify behavior of that great mass of the American people whoneed the extra money each month.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
