Iran says the Iraqiattacks killed 28 civilians.   The renewed missile raid followed an appeal by United NationsSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for a halt in the ``warof the cities,'' which has raged for more than two weeks apart froma fragile two-day truce.   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi said in Tehran that theU.N. Security Council was no more than a tool in the hands of themajor powers.   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.   In Istanbul, two newspapers reported that Premier Turgut Ozalsaid Turkey closed its airspace to all military flights from Iranor Iraq, both neighbors of Turkey.   The U.S. Defense Department said the 17th Persian Gulf convoyoperation of the year ended Thursday morning. It said theU.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Gas Prince arrived safely off Kuwait,escorted by the guided-missile frigate USS Simpson.   The missile strike was reported by the official Iraqi NewsAgency, which said Iraq was bombarding ``the nest of evil, thehideout of the charlatans, because instead of accepting peace theyhave chosen the course of aggression.''   Iraq says it has launched 23 missiles into the Iranian capitalsince Sunday, when the ``war of the cities'' reignited after atwo-day truce. Iran has reported firing seven missiles into Baghdad.   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said 28 civilians werekilled in the latest missile strike and in Iraqi warplane raids onfour cities. Both sides have reported scores of civilian casualtiessince Feb. 29, but neither has given an overall figure.   The agency also said Iranian forces Thursday fired sevenshort-range missiles into Zoubair, an industrial town south ofBasra, and pounded border towns along the front.   Iran said its forces captured the town of Dojaila, which IRNAsaid has a population of 20,000, and Halabja, a town of 70,000people. The towns are in Sulaymaniyah province 160 miles north ofBaghdad.   The Iranian agency said 2,500 Iraqi soldiers were killed orwounded in the fighting Thursday. It gave no breakdown of the deadand wounded, and the figures could not be independently confirmed.   The Iraqi agency quoted an unidentified spokesman as denyingthere has been any combat in the region and calling the Iranianclaims ``cheap lies.''   Tehran radio said Iranian combatants had seized 300 square milesof Iraqi territory in the region, including 102 villages. It saidthe prisoners included Maj. Gen. Ali Hussein Obaid al-Algawi,described as the commander of Iraq's 43rd infantry division.   The Iranian agency said Iraqi forces used chemical bombs againstDojaila and Halabja, ``killing many defenseless residents.'' Itsaid the two towns were ``liberated under heavy bombing raids fromthe air by chemical bombs.''   The state-run agency also reported, without attribution, that4,000 civilian residents of Halabja were killed when the town washit by Iraqi chemical bombs Wednesday. Iraq did not comment on theclaim and it could not be independently confirmed.   Ozal said the ban on flying through Turkey's airspace applied toall Iranian or Iraqi planes with military cargo. Turkey maintainsrelations with both nations and represents them in each other'scapitals.   Ozal was quoted by the dailies Sabah and Cumhuriyet.   Two Iranian cargo planes and two Iraqi cargo planes reportedlyloaded with arms were denied permission to use Turkish airspace aweek ago.</TEXT></DOC>
