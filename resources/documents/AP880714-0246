It was the second boost in the key lending rate this year andsignaled a new round of higher interest rates for consumers onloans for purchases ranging from automobiles to homes.   The increase came one day after Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan warned he would use the central bank's power to tightencredit if inflation started to accelerate.   Separately, American consumers boosted retail sales 0.5 percentin June by purchasing more cars and summer gear, the governmentreported today, but the increase wasn't as strong as expected andcould ease concerns about inflation.   The Commerce Department said sales increased $713 million lastmonth to a seasonally adjusted, but not inflation-adjusted, $132.8billion. Much of the increase came from sales of autos, airconditioners, barbecues and clothes.   Analysts had been expecting a gain of about 0.8 percent. Themoderate June increase therefore may dampen anxiety in financialmarkets that the economy is too strong, lessening pressure on theFederal Reserve to tighten credit.   The retail sales report came a day after Fed Chairman AlanGreenspan warned he would use higher interest rates to battle anyresurgence of inflation.   Currency investors interpreted Greenspan's comments assupportive of the dollar, which finished mostly higher despitereports of central bank intervention. But the stock marketdiscounted his warnings and the bond market was mixed.   Delivering his midyear report to Congress on monetary policy,Greenspan also said the Fed and other central banks would continueto work for stable exchange rates. He said he saw no evidence thatthe growth of U.S. exports has been affected by the dollar's recentrise against other major currencies.   Greenspan said the central bank stands ready to push interestrates higher to stem inflation. And the risks of a new wage-pricespiral are ``sufficiently great'' that the Fed should err on theside of squeezing credit, rather than stimulating the economy, hesaid.   Greenspan said the Fed already has made a series of smallcredit-tightening steps from late March through late June, allowingshort-term interest rates to rise.   Nevertheless, inflationary pressures _ including tight labormarkets, high factory operating rates and drought-caused increasesin grain prices _ remain and must be curbed now rather than later,he said.   Greenspan's pledge to continue fighting inflation gave bondprices an early boost, but they finished mixed.   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, downabout 10 points at its afternoon low, closed with an 11.73 pointgain at 2,104.37. The late round of buying was attributed byanalysts to computer program trading.   Grain and soybean futures closed sharply higher on the ChicagoBoard of Trade, with most contracts up their allowable limit inreaction to Tuesday's government report showing severe droughtdamage to crops.   Crude oil prices skidded to a 21-month low as traders grew morepessimistic about overproduction by OPEC members. On the New YorkMercantile Exchange, the August-delivery price of West TexasIntermediate crude fell 28 cents to close at $14.44 a barrel.
