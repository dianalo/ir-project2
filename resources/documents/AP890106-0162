Cary C. Walker reported the truce in the so-called ``hormonewar'' was approved Thursday, essentially for goods in transit.   A European ban on imports of such meat went into effect Jan. 1,affecting U.S. sales worth about $100 million a year. There was animmediate U.S. reprisal in the form of an additional 100 percentimport duty on a group of food imports, including Danish hams andsun-dried tomatoes from Italy, worth about the same amount.   Under the agreement, the United States is also suspending the newduties on goods if they were shipped before Jan. 1 and arrive inthis country by Jan. 31. Walker said unidentified governments in thecommunity suggested the truce and the U.S. administration acceptedon condition it apply throughout the 12 countries.   Hormones are implanted in cows and calves to make them growfaster. Their use is forbidden in the ECC countries, but there havebeen reports of widespread violations.   The 12 governments maintain that because of the ban, they havethe right under international agreements to also ban imports. Otherexporters of beef to Erope, including Canada and Australia, haveagreed to ship only meat from animals not implanted.   Alan Holmer, Yeutter's deputy, said Thursday the import ban is arestriction on trade disguised as a health measure, which has noscientific basis.   Faced with the reprisal, the European Commission -- the jointexecutive of the 12 countries -- recommended a counter-reprisal.Ambassadors representing the 12 governments at communityheadquarters in Brussels pared down the commission'scounter-reprisal list on Thursday to about $96 million worth of U.S.walnuts and dried prunes, peaches, apricots and papayas.   A decision is due when ministers of foreign affairs from the 12countries meet in Brussels Jan. 23 for a regular two-day session.That will be three days after the inauguration of President-electBush.</TEXT></DOC>
