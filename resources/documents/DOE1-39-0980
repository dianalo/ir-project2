The nonlinear consequences of spirals, heatingand angular momentum transfer, can be reliably measured in the N-bodyexperiments, and are comparable to estimates made using quasi-lineartheory. The heating time scale is of order 10 orbital periods, and theangular momentum transfer time is of order 100 orbital periods. Manyof the important aspects of disk galaxies are directly modeled in theseN-body experiments. Finally, a speculative origin of SO galaxies is suggested.29 references.</TEXT></DOC>
