The message implicit in the high court's action is thatstate courts should re-examine their systems and apply newguidelines announced two weeks ago when the Supreme Courtupheld an Alabama jury's $1,077,978 verdict against PacificMutual Life Insurance Co.</LP><TEXT>   Lawyers who have been challenging punitive awards onbehalf of business welcomed the high court's action yesterdayas a sign that the Pacific Mutual decision wasn't a completesetback to their efforts. &quot;I think they are still circlingthe issue warily,&quot; said Andrew Frey, a Washington lawyer.   The March 4 ruling against Pacific Mutual said theConstitution's guarantee of &quot;due process&quot; doesn't require thecourt to spell out a single set of standards to guide juriesin awarding punitive damages in all cases. But the high courtsaid punitive awards must be reasonable and should becarefully scrutinized by trial judges and appeals courts.   Punitive damages are awarded in civil cases to punish ordeter a defendant's conduct and are distinct fromcompensatory damages, which are intended to reimburse aplaintiff for injuries or harm. Business has mounted acampaign to limit punitive awards, complaining that juriesare too willing to assess large damages against companies.   The justices have taken no action on nine other appealsthat had been filed; they were waiting until they decided thePacific Mutual case.   In seven of the nine cases, the high court yesterday threwout the punitive damage awards and ordered the lower courtsto reconsider them based on the standards in the PacificMutual ruling. The high court's action suggests that thejustices don't want to review any more punitive damages casesuntil they see how the state courts apply the Pacific Mutualdecision.   In most such cases, the compensatory damages have alreadybeen paid and weren't affected by the high court's action.The lower courts' options include invalidating a state'ssystem or upholding the system and reinstating the punitivedamages.   The seven cases are:   -- An award by a California jury of $558,000 incompensatory damages and $2 million in punitive damagesagainst Pacific Lighting Corp., now known as PacificEnterprises Corp., for refusing to pay a real estate broker'sfee. (Pacific Lighting Corp. vs. MGW Inc.)   -- Punitive damages of $1.3 million and compensatorydamages of $5,001 against the Gwinnett County, Ga., HospitalAuthority, awarded by a Georgia jury for negligent care intaking a burn patient to a county facility instead of to aprivate hospital burn unit. (Hospital Authority of GwinnettCounty vs. Jones)   -- A compensatory award of $79,519 and a punitive damageaward of $500,000 against Portec Inc., assessed by a Coloradofederal jury for misappropriation of trade secrets and breachof a fiduciary duty. The punitive award was reduced by afederal appeals court in Denver from $1.5 million. (PortecInc. vs. Post Office)   -- A punitive award of $500,000 against Reserve LifeInsurance Co., a Sammons Enterprises Inc. unit, for failingto pay a health claim. The damages were awarded by a federaljudge in Mississippi in a nonjury trial. (Reserve LifeInsurance Co. vs. Eichenseer)   -- Compensatory damages of $7,923 and punitive damages of$400,000 against Clayton Brokerage Co. of St. Louis, a unitof Garnac Grain Co., awarded by a federal jury in Missourifor commodity fraud. (Clayton Brokerage Co. vs. Jordan)   -- An award of $485,000 in compensatory damages and $2.5million in punitive damages -- a total of $5.3 million withinterest -- against the International Society for KrishnaConsciousness of California, for brainwashing a 14-year-oldgirl and hiding her from her parents. The California juryaward was reduced by both a trial judge and appeals courtfrom $32.6 million. The sect's assets have been placed undersupervision of a state receiver. (International Society forKrishna Consciousness vs. George)   -- Compensatory damages of $500,000 and punitive damagesof $2 million against the Church of Scientology ofCalifornia, awarded by a California jury for coercingparticipation in religious practices. The award was reducedby an appeals court from $30 million. (Church of Scientologyof California vs. Wollersheim)   Also yesterday, the high court let stand two decisionsthat came from the Alabama court system, the same system thatthe high court upheld in the Pacific Mutual case. The courtleft intact:   -- A $750,000 punitive damage award against MassachusettsMutual Life Insurance Co., after a jury said the firm engagedin life insurance fraud. (Massachusetts Mutual Life vs.Collins)   -- A $600,000 punitive damage verdict against GeneralAmerican Life Insurance Co., also awarded by a jury for lifeinsurance fraud. The trial court reduced the award to$600,000 from $2.5 million. (General American Life vs.Simmons)</TEXT></DOC>
