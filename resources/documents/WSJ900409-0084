Chairman Allen Sheppard says his company, which currentlyderives 90% of its trading profit from Britain and the U.S.,will mount greater efforts to increase its presence in bothEast and West Europe.</LP><TEXT>   Using the brand names acquired in last year's $5.7 billionacquisition of Pillsbury Inc., Mr. Sheppard said Grand Metplans to use the Green Giant frozen food, Haagen Dasz luxuryice cream and Burger King fast food names as springboards forwider growth in Europe.   &quot;We have substantial ambitions there,&quot; Mr. Sheppard saidof the company's designs on Europe in the 1990s.   In the meantime, Grand Met will concentrate onconsolidating its existing businesses after a franticexpansion period in the late 1980s. But even during itsperiod of rest, the chairman said the company wouldn't passup a chance to pick up a particularly relevant add-on to itsfood, drink and retailing businesses.   Because much of the European food market is highlyfragmented, regionalized, family-owned and diffuse, &quot;we'vegot to be very careful,&quot; the chairman said. &quot;We could be busyfools and make an acquisition a week, but we'd probably endup with bits and pieces of food companies spread acrossEurope. The market would wonder why we did it.&quot; Instead, Mr.Sheppard sees a continuing process of &quot;small but relevant&quot;food acquisitions in Europe during the next several years.   But some people in London's financial community areconcerned that the company appears too acquisition-hungry andmight be tempted to devour another company as a follow-up toits Pillsbury purchase. &quot;It's not that Grand Met would beoverly stretched, but thoughts of another deal give peopleindigestion,&quot; said one analyst, who asked not to beidentified.   Grand Met's gearing, or its ratio of debt to shareholders'funds, stood at nearly 200% immediately after the Pillsburyacquisition. But the company has worked hard to bring itsbalance sheet back in line. With the completion of itsrecently announced asset swap with Elders IXL, its gearingwill be sheared to 65%. Once it finds a buyer for Alpo petfood in the U.S., the level will come down to about 50%.   Nonetheless, Mr. Sheppard was quick to soothe the nervesof unconverted critics. &quot;In the foreseeable future, we don'tenvisage making another macro bid over #500 million pounds{$821.1 million},&quot; he said, adding a disclaimer that &quot;unlesswe get some fantastic opportunity that comes along which wejust can't and shouldn't resist.&quot;   As for the European drinks operation, Mr. Sheppard saidGrand Met already has well-established and sophisticateddistribution links built up during the past five years injust about every European country. Joint ventures includesome of the best names in European spirits like Cinzano,Grand Marnier and Metaxa. The brands owned outright read likea Who's Who of the drinks world, including Jandamp;B Scotch whiskyand Smirnoff vodka.   Grand Met recently said it is negotiating to buy a 20%stake in France's Remy Martin for #100 million. The dealfills what many analysts saw as the last remaining gap inGrand Met's drinks line-up, an internationally brandedcognac. Remy's portfolio also includes premium label Krug andPiper-Heidsieck champagnes, orange-flavored liqueur Cointreauand a number of leading wines.   In its latest earnings report for the year ended inSeptember, Grand Met had a 27% leap in pretax profit to #732million from #575 million a year earlier. Although figuresaren't disaggregated by division and geography, world-widedrinks business accounted for #2.04 billion in sales and #230million in trading profit in the latest results, comparedwith #1.04 billion and #143 million, respectively, the yearbefore.   By sector, 1990 is expected to bring 38% of its tradingprofit from drinks, 31% from retailing and 31% from food.   Grand Met enjoys the position of being the world's largestwine and spirits seller and the eighth-largest food group.   There's also a move afoot to bring more of Grand Met'sBurger King restaurants to the Continent. Mr. Sheppard saidthe company is exploring opportunities in France, Spain andWest Germany for more exposure. Its purchase of Wimpey in theUnited Kingdom has given Grand Met a &quot;more active stance&quot; inallowing it to push toward the continent. Giving Burger Kinga toehold in Europe will start in West Germany, Mr. Sheppardsaid.   Mr. Sheppard sees Eastern Europe as fertile ground forGreen Giant products, where there could be a swap of itsagricultural know-how and technology in exchange for abundantland and labor. Multinational sourcing of food products hasbecome a more critical quest for Grand Met recently, Mr.Sheppard said, especially in light of last year's drought inthe U.S.   Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany are the naturalareas where the company would look for new business.</TEXT></DOC>
