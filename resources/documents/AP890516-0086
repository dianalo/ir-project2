On Israel radio, Police Commissioner David Krauss called forIsraeli employers to send Palestinian workers home to the coastalstrip.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the orders were aimed atpressuring Arabs to halt violence in the Israeli-occupiedterritories.   ``The intention is to warn the residents that permission forfree travel and work in Israel are not givens,'' Rabin told Israelradio. ``They depend on the behavior of those who leave for work.''   About 50,000 Arabs from Gaza and about 60,000 from the West Bankwork in Israel.   It was uncertain how many workers were being rounded up. Mostwere kept at home by a curfew declared Monday night in Gaza,requiring all 700,000 of the strip's residents to stay at home. Noreason was given for the curfew but it was believed linked to therecent death of an Israeli soldier, allegedly at the hands ofPalestinian guerrillas.   Under Israeli law, Arabs from Gaza and the West Bank are notallowed to stay in Israel overnight, but the law is widely skirtedby workers who sleep in dormitories or their work places.   In Jerusalem, witnesses reported seeing police checking theidentities of Palestinians at major intersection. Those from Gazawere reportedly put in police vehicles for tranport back to thestrip.   At the Erez crossing into the Gaza Strip, hundreds ofPalestinian workers sat on the ground under army guard, a witnesssaid. He said most were brought to the area in Israeli taxis andthen taken by army truck back to Gaza.   The uprising has been more violent in the Gaza Strip in recentweeks than in the West Bank. The smaller Gaza Strip, with few roadsleading into Israel, also can be more easily controlled byauthorities.   Also today, a Palestinian died of gunshot wounds sustainedearlier in the week in a shootout with police. The death of AliMahmoud Muhammed Jabber, 23, raised to 476 the number ofPalestinians killed in the uprising. Twenty-one Israelis also havedied.   In Gaza City today, three Palestinians were shot and wounded inclashes with troops, including a 20-year-old who was shot in theback, Arab hospital officials said. In the West Bank a 22-year-oldman was reported shot by soldiers.   Israeli officials, meanwhile, shrugged off the PLO's rejectionof Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan for elections in theterritories and urged Palestinians to take part in the vote.   Rabin told Israel radio that it would be the only offer of peaceby the government.   ``There must be patience,'' Rabin said. ``They will understandthat they have only one alternative and that is based on thegovernment plan.... There is and will be no other alternative.''   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens today flew to Washington to discussthe 20-point peace plan with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.   U.S. State Department envoy Dennis Ross was expected in Israelthis afternoon to brief Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on hisdiscussions in Egypt and Jordan on the plan, and to meet withPalestinian leaders.   The United States has asked Israel to clarify whether electionswould include the 140,000 Arab residents of Jerusalem, the nation'scapital, and if there would be international supervision of theballoting.   The plan, overwhelmingly approved by Israel's Cabinet on Sunday,calls for Palestinians to elect representatives to negotiate withIsrael on a five-year period of limited autonomy, with talks in thethird year on the final status of the territories.   However, Israel would not negotiate with the PLO. It alsoopposes formation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gazaand wants the negotiations to lead to a peace treaty with Jordan.</TEXT></DOC>
