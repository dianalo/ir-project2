Grand Met will purchase all outstanding shares of Pillsburycommon stock for $66 per share in cash, $3 higher than Grand Met'smost recent tender offer, which was made last week.   ``The shareholders got much, much more money than either themarketplace was offering or Pillsbury's restructuring offered,''Karl Cambronne, a lawyer for dissident Pillsbury shareholders.``Ithink the shareholders did well.''   Lawyers, investment bankers and company officials worked out thedeal's details Saturday and Sunday, and Pillsbury's board approvedthe deal Sunday afternoon.   On Friday, a judge in Delaware, where Pillsbury is incorporated,issued preliminary injunctions to invalidate Pillsbury's ``poisonpill'' takeover defense and temporarily block the company's plannedspinoff of its Burger King Corp. Grand Met requested the rulings.   Ruling in a separate lawsuit filed by dissident Pillsburyshareholders, a Minnesota judge also temporarily blocked the BurgerKing spinoff and said he probably would invalidate the ``pill.''   Pillsbury decided to deal because the ``pill,'' its onlybargaining chip, was gone, said Stephen Carnes, an analyst withPiper Jaffray andamp; Hopwood in Minneapolis.   Pillsbury common stock was trading at $39 a share the day beforeGrand Met launched its $60-per-share hostile takeover bid Oct. 4.Pillsbury's stock closed at 62\ Friday on the New York StockExchange. It opened today at 65\.   ``The price is fair,'' Carnes said. ``It's a good thing fromseveral standpoints. (The takeover fight has) been drawn out toolong. I think it's had an effect on the operations at Pillsbury, somaybe (Grand Met) can start putting that back together quickly.''   The takeover of Pillsbury is the latest in a wave of mergers andrecapitalizations that have swept through the foods industry inrecent years.   It also comes less than a month after another giant of theindustry, RJR Nabisco, agreed to be taken over in a leveragedbuyout. The $25 billion deal was the largest in U.S. corporatehistory.   The tender offer made by Grand Met, the British real estate,liquor and gambling conglomerate, expires at midnight Jan. 3 unlessextended, according to a statement issued by both companies.   As of the close of business Friday, 61,848,918 of Pillsburycommon shares, representing about 72 percent of the company's morethan 86 million outstanding shares, had been tendered to Grand Metand not withdrawn.   Pillsbury's 15 board members urged stockholders to tender theirshares to Grand Met.   ``We are pleased that we have succeeded in protecting theinterests of our shareholders, employees, franchisees andcommunities, and that we have reached a negotiated agreement thatworks to the advantage of everyone,'' said Philip L. Smith, chairmanand chief executive officer of Pillsbury.   Ian A. Martin, chief executive of Grand Met's U.S. operations,said Grand Met officials also are pleased with the agreement.   ``Pillsbury is the perfect fit to enable Grand Metropolitan toachieve its strategy of becoming a world leader in foods andretailing, as well as the drinks sector,'' Martin said.   Grand Met's products and services in the United States includeALPO Petfoods and Pearle Vision Centres.   Pillsbury, which started as Pillsbury Flour Mills with a singleflour mill in Minneapolis in 1869, makes Pillsbury flour, GreenGiant vegetables and a variety of other products. In addition toBurger King, it owns Benningan's and Steak andamp; Ale restaurant chains.During the fiscal year that ended May 31, the company had nearly$6.2 billion in revenues. It employs 104,000 people.   Last month, Pillsbury announced it would make Burger King aseparate company, complete with its own board of directors and newlyissued stock. The spinoff was to occur today.   The move had been widely viewed as a last-ditch effort byPillsbury to fend off Grand Met.</TEXT></DOC>
