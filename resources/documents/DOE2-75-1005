<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-75-1005 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new technical option for the coal industry in dealing with the carbondioxide greenhouse effect has been devised. The option concerns a &quot;hydrogeneconomy&quot; based on coal. We have developed a very efficient process calledHYDROCARB, which effectively splits coal into carbon and hydrogen. Thisprocess produces a clean, pure carbon fuel from coal for applicationin both mobile and stationary heat engines. We are suggesting that coalrefineries be built based on this technology. A co-product of the processis a hydrogen-rich gas. If one is concerned about the greenhouse effect,then either all or part of the carbon can be withheld and either mainlyor only the hydrogen is used as fuel. If one desires to attain the ultimate,and eliminate all CO{sub 2} emissions from coal, then all of the carboncan be stored and only the hydrogen used. The option is still open forutilizing the clean carbon, which would be placed in monitored retrievablestorage, not unlike the strategic petroleum reserve (SPR). Should thegreenhouse effect be found to be a myth in the future, the carbon wouldbe taken out of storage and utilized as a clean fuel, the impuritieshaving been previously removed. This concept can be valuable to the coalindustry in response to the arguments of the anti-coal critics. Totalcapital cost estimates have been made to replace all conventional coalburning power plants in the US with technologies that eliminate emissionsof CO{sub 2}. These include removal, recovery and disposal of CO{sub2}, nuclear, solar, photovoltaics, biomass, and HYDROCARB. 12 refs.,1 fig. 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
