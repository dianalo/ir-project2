Mack, Center for FoodSafety and Applied Nutrition (HFF-335), Food and Drug Administration, 200C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202-472-5690.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In a notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 26, 1984 (49 FR 18044), FDA announcedthat a petition (FAP 3H3756) has been filed by Economics Laboratory, Inc.,Osborn Bldg., St. Paul, MN 55102 (the name and address of the company havebeen changed to EcoLab, Inc., Ecolab Center, St. Paul, MN 55102), proposingthat andSection; 178.1010 <T3>Sanitizing solutions </T3>(21 CFR 178.1010) be amended in paragraphs(b)(27) and (c)(22) to provide for the safe use of sodium mono-and dimethylnaphthalenesulfonatesfor use on food-contact surfaces. Subsequently, FDA published an amendedfiling notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 1, 1987 (52 FR 10412), that made clearthat the chemical names of the components of the sanitizing solution aredecanoic acid, octanoic acid, and a mixture of: (1) The sodium salt ofnaphthalenesulfonic acid; (2) the methyl, dimethyl, and trimethyl derivativesof the sodium salt of naphthalenesulfonic acid; and (3) a mixture of thesodium salt of naphthalenesulfonic acid and the methyl, dimethyl, and trimethylderivatives of the sodium salt of naphthalenesulfonic acid alkylated at3 percent by weight with C<T2>6</T2>-C<T2>9</T2> linear olefins. The amended filing notice also made clear thatthe methyl and dimethyl substituted derivatives (described in (2) above)constitute no less than 70 percent by weight of the mixture of naphthalene-sulfonatesand corrected the previous filing notice by omitting the proposed specificamendments in andSection; 178.1010 (b)(27) and (c)(22).FDA has reviewed the safety of the individual food additives that are componentsof the sanitizing solution, including phosphoric acid and lactic acid,which for the reasons explained below, were not listed in the originalor amended notice of filings.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Safety of Petitioned Use of the Additives </ITAG>Sanitizing solutions are mixtures of ingredients. Each listed componentin a sanitizing solution has a functional effect. The subject sanitizingsolution contains two short chain fatty acids (decanoic acid and octanoicacid) which function as antimicrobial agents; phosphoric and lactic acidwhich assist in controlling the pH and stabilizing the sanitizing solution,respectively, and a mixture of: (1) The sodium salt of naphthalenesulfonicacid; (2) the methyl, dimethyl, and trimethyl derivatives of the sodiumsalt of naphthalenesulfonic acid; and (3) a mixture of the sodium saltof naphthalenesulfonic acid and the methyl, dimethyl, and trimethyl derivativesof the sodium salt of naphthalenesulfonic acid alkylated at 3 percent byweight with C<T2>6</T2>-C<T2>9</T2> linear olefins which functions as an emulsifier. A. <T3>Short Chain Fatty Acids. </T3>The two short chain fatty acids, decanoicacid and octanoic acid, are antimicrobial agents in the subject sanitizingsolution and are used in a currently regulated sanitizing solution listedin 21 CFR 178.1010 (b)(27) and (c)(22). On the basis of the data submittedin support of these regulated uses, and of the data contained in the foodadditive petition submitted in support of this sanitizing solution, FDAfinds that the use of these fatty acids in the subject sanitizing solutionis safe and effective.B. <T3>Phosphoric Acid and Lactic Acid. </T3>Phosphoric acid functions asa pH stabilizer, and lactic acid assists in stabilizing the sanitizingsolution formulation in the subject sanitizing solution. Phosphoric acidis used in many currently regulated sanitizing solutions listed in 21 CFR178.1010. Phosphoric and lactic acid are listed as generally recognizedas safe (GRAS) in 21 CFR 182.1073 and 184.1061, respectively.Neither compound was specifically listed in andSection; 178.1010 <T3>Sanitizing solutions. </T3>They were not listed in the April 26, 1984,filing notice (49 FR 18044) or the April 1, 1987, amended filing notice(52 FR 10412) because the petitioner did not list these substances in theproposed amendment. The petitioner believed that the use of phosphoricacid and lactic acid in sanitizing solutions was GRAS, and that the useof GRAS substances in such solutions was authorized under 21 CFR 178.1010(b).However, FDA includes GRAS ingredients in food additive regulations forsanitizing solutions when the agency considers the use of these ingredientsto be essential in the formulation. On the basis of data submitted in support of these current regulated usesand safety and efficacy data contained in the food additive petition, FDAconcludes that the use of phosphoric acid and lactic acid in the sanitizingsolution is safe. Because they assist in controlling the pH and stabilizingthe sanitizing solution, respectively, they are essential ingredients inthe sanitizing formulation. Therefore, in accord with its general policyof listing substances that are essential in sanitizing solutions, evenif they are GRAS, the agency is including phosphoric acid in this regulation.C. A mixture of: (1) the Sodium Salt of Naphthalenesulfonic acid; (2) theMethyl, Dimethyl, and Trimethyl Derivatives of the Sodium Salt of NaphthalenesulfonicAcid; and (3) a Mixture of the Sodium Salt of Naphthalenesulfonic Acid,and the Methyl, Dimethyl, and Trimethyl Derivatives of the Sodium Saltof Naphthalenesulfonic Acid Alkylated at 3 percent by Weight with C<T2>6</T2>-C<T2>9</T2> Linear Olefins (NSA Mixture).The NSA mixture functions as a emulsifier in the subject sanitizing solution.The methyl and dimethyl derivatives of the sodium salt of naphthalenesulfonicacid constitute no less than 70 percent by weight of the NSA mixture. TheNSA mixture is not listed under 21 CFR 178.1010. However, the methyl anddimethyl derivates of the sodium salt of naphthalenesulfonic acid are listedunder 21 CFR 173.315 and 172.824 (as ``sodium mono- and dimethyl naphthalenesulfonates'')for direct food contact use. On the basis of the data submitted in supportof these currently regulated uses of components of the NSA mixture andof the data contained in the food additive petition submitted in supportof this sanitizing solution, FDA finds that the use of this mixture inthe subject sanitizing solution is safe and effective. FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. Theagency concludes that the proposed food additive use is safe, and thatthe regulations in 21 CFR 178.1010 should be amended by adding paragraphs(b)(35) and (c)(30) as set forth below. In accordance with andSection; 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition andthe documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decisionto approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center forFood Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contactperson listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will deletefrom the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosurebefore making the documents available for inspection. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Environmental Impact </ITAG>The agency has previously considered the environmental effects of thisrule as announced in the amended notice of filing for FAP 3H3756 (April1, 1987; 52 FR 10412). No new information or comments have been receivedthat would affect the agency's previous determination that there is nosignificant impact on the human environment, and that an environmentalimpact statement is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Filing of Objections </ITAG>Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at anytime on or before September 21, 1988, file with the Dockets ManagementBranch (address above) written objections thereto.
