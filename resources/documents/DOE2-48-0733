<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-48-0733 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors developed a rigorous wave equation method for inversion ofmarine seismic data that extracts true values of acoustic impedance vstraveltime, assuming 3d flat-layered geology. The method uses an inversescattering approach that is direct (non-iterative layer-stripping), fullynonlinear (includes multiples), and operates in the frequency domain.A form of the acoustic response is used that satisfies a first-ordernonlinear differential equation of the Riccati type, in 3D (cylindrical)slant stack domain. Properties of the solution to this equation are usedto derive the impedance profile from the response's high frequency limitat each depth. An ansatz that has the same analytic properties as thedata is used in the implementation of the method. The inversion has threeparts: 1) preprocessing of the data, including true-amplitude pulse estimation,deconvolution of source and array effects, deghosting, and slant stacking;2) fitting the ansatz to the near-vertical-incidence components of thepreprocessed data, using constraints that enforce a wave equation solution;and 3) downward evolution of the ansatz and extraction of the impedance.The authors demonstrate this Riccati method using real data that containstrong 0.6 second water bottom multiples and a mixed-phase notched-spectrumpulse. The results show that noise filtering using the positive-realcondition on the total response stabilizes these broadband inversions,and that the multiple energy has been largely removed from the impedanceprofiles during the layer-stripping process.</TEXT></DOC>
