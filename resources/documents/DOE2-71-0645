The sequence of phase formation at600 and 500{sup 0}C between bulk Pd and GaAs was established. Formationof the solution phase {mu} and the ternary phase T initially does notrepresent the stable configuration. The stable configuration is GaAsabsolute value of {Epsilon} {lambda} absolute value of {gamma} absolutevalue of {nu} Pd and is termed the diffusion path between GaAs and Pd.Phase formation for the thin-film Pd/GaAs specimens was studied at 180,220, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 600, and 1000{sup 0}C for various annealingtimes. The sequence of phase formation obtained from the thin-film experimentsis consistent with the bulk results. The diffusion path concept providesa useful guide in understanding the phase formation in M-GaAs interface.This information is important in designing a uniform, stable contactfor the metallization of GaAs.</TEXT></DOC>
