Some analysts expect a sluggish first quarter for these two store chains as retail consumer buying continues to be soft.    For its fourth quarter, ended Jan. 27, Troy, Mich.-based K mart posted a 13% jump in net income to $321.2 million, or $1.58 a share, from $285 million, or $1.41 a share, in the year-ago quarter, which included a $30.8 million gain from discontinued operations and a $16.4 million charge because of the redemption of debt. Sales rose 7.2% to $7.76 billion from $7.23 billion.    Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson's net fell to $133.7 million, or $1.54 a share, in its fourth quarter, ended Jan. 30, from $202.4 million, or $2.08 a share, a year earlier. The year-ago quarter includes a $94.2 million gain from discontinued operations and a $12.6 million charge for the redemption of debt. Sales rose 18% to $3.68 billion from $3.12 billion.    K mart said that although sales for the quarter were below expectations, the company avoided heavy markdowns during the critical Christmas shopping season. In addition, the effective tax rate for the quarter dropped to 41.4% from 45.1% in the year-ago period.    While Dayton Hudson's earnings were helped by lower tax rates, the retailer also cited cost-cutting at its troubled Mervyn's apparel and household soft goods chain. In the fourth quarter, Mervyn's operating profit increased from the year-ago quarter; it was the first time all year the chain reported such an increase.    &quot;Mervyn's is moving in the right direction but these things don't turn around overnight. It's been a disappointment all year long,&quot; said Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    But Dayton Hudson department stores were hurt by aggressive markdowns they were forced to take because of sluggish sales.    Some analysts expect a fairly flat first quarter for retailers as consumers continue to stay home. &quot;If sales don't pick up in the next couple of weeks I think we're going to see a lot of panic promotions,&quot; said William N. Smith, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. &quot;The quarter could be down for some retailers.&quot;    Added Stacy Ruchlamer, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.: &quot;In the first six months, (consumer buying) will continue to be soft.&quot;    K mart shares closed yesterday at $34.375, off 50 cents, and Dayton Hudson at $38.25, off $1.50, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    For the year, K mart reported net of $692.2 million, or $3.40 a share, up 19% from $582.3 million, or $2.90 a share, a year ago. The previous year included a $28.4 million gain from discontinued operations and a $16.4 million charge for the redemption of debt. Sales rose 7.6% to $25.63 billion from $23.81 billion.    For the year, Dayton Hudson earned $228.4 million, or $2.41 a share, down 26% from $310 million, or $3.19 a share, a year ago. The previous year included an $87.3 million gain from discontinued operations and a $32.3 million charge for the redemption of debt. Sales jumped 15% to $10.68 billion from $9.26 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
