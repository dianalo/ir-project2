Critics of index arbitrage and other forms of program trading won a partial victory yesterday when the Securities and Exchange Commission gave temporary approval to a New York Stock Exchange rule intended to curtail programs whenever the Dow industrials move 50 points or more in a day. That approval marks the first time the government has endorsed limits on the use of computers in securities trading.    Much of the reaction to programs focuses on the damage to investor confidence that computerized trading programs are said to be doing. Indeed, in its order on the Big Board rule, the SEC cited &quot;the fragile nature of public confidence&quot; as one reason for giving its approval.    Similar concern was expressed yesterday on Capitol Hill, where a panel of Wall Street professionals warned the Senate Banking Committee that program-related trading abuses, such as market manipulation and so-called intermarket front-running, could erode public confidence.    Meanwhile, in a speech here to state securities regulators, former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach warned that the &quot;public perception is not that of a free market, but, I believe, of a market far too limited to the rich and the powerful.&quot; He said, &quot;That perception will destroy public confidence ultimately, especially if another crash occurs.&quot;    Mr. Katzenbach, who last year studied program trading for the New York Stock Exchange, added: &quot;Most of the trading is being done by at most a dozen large American firms for their own account or for the account of rather large funds,&quot; using techniques unavailable to the individual investor.    But the strongest blast came earlier this week from Donald Regan, the former Treasury secretary and former Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. chairman, who on the NBC business news show &quot;Before Hours,&quot; produced in association with The Wall Street Journal, described the situation in the stock market as &quot;ridiculous&quot; and called for restrictions on program trading.    &quot;What it is doing is encouraging people who are in the trading houses, or a few institutions with these sophisticated computers, to try to shave profits here and there on a daily basis at the expense of the individual investor,&quot; Mr. Regan said. &quot;That should be outlawed, in my judgment.&quot;    Of course, complaints about program trading are hardly new. And despite the recent increase in the volume of those complaints, computerized trading still has plenty of supporters in the markets and in Washington. Fischer Black, a Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. partner, said he doesn't see computerized trading as a problem, and doesn't expect the Big Board's &quot;collar&quot; on it to have much effect.    &quot;I don't think things having to do with the mechanics of the market are either the problem or the solution,&quot; said Mr. Black, who is co-author of the standard optionpricing formula that is widely seen as the foundation of portfolio insurance, a major form of computerized trading.    Leo Melamed, the chairman of the executive committee of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which accounts for the bulk of trading in stock-index futures, said, &quot;If this country is going to take the view that the use of technology is to be limited, I think in the long run we'll lose out. I can't believe that's the direction this country wants to go.&quot;    But Mr. Melamed expressed no strong objections to the SEC's approval of the Big Board's new rule.    In its order approving the rule, the SEC said it continues to believe that the response to the October crash should focus primarily on expanding the capacity of the markets. It also conceded that index arbitrage provides a useful link between the stock and futures markets. Index arbitrage is a form of program trading in which securities firms carry out blizzards of trades to profit from price discrepancies between stocks and stock-index futures.    But, the SEC order continued, &quot;the commission is concerned about the extreme volatility&quot; in the markets over the past six months. The order brushed off questions about the possible long-term effect of the rule, saying the SEC also is &quot;concerned that, in view of the fragile nature of investor confidence, it might be especially unsettling to disapprove a perceived response to market volatility&quot; because of such questions. The SEC emphasized that it approved the rule for only six months, during which its impact will be assessed.    Meanwhile, two veteran Wall Street traders, Victor Sperandeo of Hugo Securities Co. and Robert Kanter of Arbco L.P., told the Senate Banking Committee that intermarket trading abuses such as front-running and manipulation are surprisingly widespread. Intermarket front-running involves trading in futures contracts in order to profit from knowledge of impending orders in the stock market.    Robert Kirby, chairman of Capital Guardian Trust Co. and a member of the presidential panel that studied the crash, testified that while intermarket front-running is almost impossible to detect, most institutional investors believe it is &quot;a common, ongoing problem.&quot;    --Randall Smith in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
