Moody's said it is evaluating the White Plains, N.Y.-based oil company's financial and organizational structure in response to its recent emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings. About $8.8 billion in debt is under review.    The rating concern said it also will examine management's plan to sell Texaco assets as well as the company's strategy for replacing petroleum reserves.    Most Texaco debt is rated Ca or Caa, a rating generally used for debt of companies that are in default or in bankruptcy-law proceedings. </TEXT></DOC>
