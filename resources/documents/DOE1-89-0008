<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-89-0008 </DOCNO><TEXT>A north-south structural transect through the south-central Brooks Range,Alaska, exposes three lithologically distinct, fault-bounded packagesof rock, all regionally metamorphosed during the Late Jurassic to EarlyCretaceous contractional deformation that formed much of the Brooks Rangefold and thrust belt. These are, from south to north and structurallyhighest to lowest, (1) the prehnite-pumpellyite facies ophiolitic rocksof the Angayucham terrane, (2) the low-grade metasedimentary rocks ofthe Rosie Creek allochthon, and (3) pumpellyite-actinolite to glaucophane-epidotefacies metamorphic rocks of the schist belt. The presence of rocks metamorphosedand deformed at shallow levels of the fold and thrust belt (the Angayuchamterrane and Rosie Creek allochthon) lying structurally above rocks representingthe deepest exposed levels of the fold and thrust belt (the schist belt)indicates that the imbricate stack is disrupted by south-dipping, low-anglenormal faults along the southern margin of the Brooks Range. The authorspropose that normal faults developed in response to the uplift of theschist belt and the overlying metasedimentary and ophiolitic allochthonsby north-directed thrusting in the late Early Cretaceous. Thrusting resultingin the oversteepening of the imbricate stack, causing compensatory normalfaulting along the southern flank of the ramp structure. Normal faultsmay have provided at least local structural control of the locus of Albianand younger sedimentation in the Koyukuk basin. 34 references.</TEXT></DOC>
