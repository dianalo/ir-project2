This species rarelyexceeds 45 millimeters (1.8 inches) in total length. The head is large,body moderately robust and the lateral line is incomplete. Coloration variesby sex, maturity, and breeding condition, while pigmentation is generallyconsistent (Williams 1968). Pigmentation generally consists of up to threedorsal saddles and mottled or spotted fins. Juveniles have a grayish blackbody with three light colored saddles. With maturity, the body color becomeslighter, with the grayish black color that remains forming two dark saddles.In juveniles, the head is black, changing to white with small scatteredmelanophores in adults. In breeding males, the dark spots in the spinousdorsal fin enlarge and become more intense and the fin margin becomes reddishorange. The entire body becomes suffused with black pigment which almostcompletely conceals the underlying pattern. The breeding color of femalestends to be slightly darker than in non-breeding females.The only known population of pygmy sculpins is in Coldwater Spring andthe spring run. Coldwater Spring is impounded to form a pool of over oneacre, 2 to 4 feet deep (McCaleb 1973). The spring run is up to 60 feetwide and 500 feet long to where it is joined by Dry Creek. Below this confluence,the stream is known as Coldwater Creek until it joins Choccolocco Creek.The spring flows from the brecciated zone of the Jacksonville fault inthe Weisner formation (Williams 1968, McCaleb 1973, Scott <T3>et al</T3>., 1987). The average flow is 32 million gallons per daywith a fairly constant temperature of 16 to 18 degrees centrigrade (61anddegrees;to 64anddegrees;F). The bottom is gravel and sand with large rocks wherethe spring boils occur. Large mats of vegetation are present in the springpool and along the edges of the spring run. Water excess to needs of theAnniston Water Department flows over a low weir dam that is approximately22 feet wide, to form the spring run. The downstream limit of the pygmysculpin population occurs at the confluence of Dry Creek. Ths small streamdrains the area of Anniston Army Depot and of a clay mining operation.Water quality degradation has been a long-term problem in Dry Creek. Historicrecords are not available to document if the pygmy sculpin occurred belowthe confluence of dry Creek prior to the water quality degradation.The City of Anniston owns Coldwater Spring, the spring run, and approximately240 surrounding acres. The spring pool serves as the primary water supplyfor Anniston. The average daily withdrawal by Anniston is 16.5 milliongallons with an average spring flow of 31.2 million gallons (Scott <T3>et al.</T3> in 1987). The recharge area for Coldwater Spring is estimatedat 90 square miles. This area includes portions of Anniston Army Depot,Fort McClellan, the Cities of Anniston and Jacksonville, several smallertowns, and private lands.Previous Service actions on this species include a notice of review onMarch 18, 1975 (40 FR 12297); a proposal to list the pygmy sculpin andthree other fishes as endangered with critical habitat on November 20,1977 (42 FR 60765); notice of extension of the comment period and publichearing on February 6, 1978 (43 FR 4872); notice of withdrawal of criticalhabitat on March 6, 1979 (44 FR 12382); reproposal of critical habitatand notice of public meeting on July 27, 1979 (44 FR 44418); notice ofwithdrawal of proposed rule on January 24, 1980 (45 FR 5782); notices ofreview on December 30, 1982 (47 FR 58454), and September 18, 1985 (50 FR37958); and proposed rule on February 7, 1989 (54 FR 5986). The pygmy sculpinwas placed in category 3C for the 1982 notice and in category 1 for the1985 notice. Category 3C candidates are defined as taxa that have provento be more abundant or widespread than was previously believed and/or thosethat are not subject to any identifiable threat. In the 1985 notice, category1 candidates are defined as comprising taxa for which the Service currentlyhas information on hand to support the biological appropriateness of proposingto list as endangered or threatened.The November 1977 listing proposal was based on threats to the pygmy sculpinfrom restricted distribution, pollution in Coldwater Creek, the effectsof aquatic vegetation control, the potential for excessive water pumpingto meet future demands, and no commitment from the Anniston Water Worksand Sewer Board to protect the sculpin.Public meetings on the 1977 proposal were held in Birmingham, Alabama,on March 15, 1978, and in Anniston, Alabama, on August 28, 1979. Numerousindividuals spoke at these meetings both for and against the proposal.The opposition was based upon the fear of economic impacts and loss ofthe spring as a water supply. Some individuals expressed doubt that thepygmy sculpin was confined to just Coldwater Spring. Former Governor Wallaceopposed the proposal to list the pygmy sculpin and three other fish speciesbased upon questions concerning the listing procedures, and the potentiallyadverse economic impact that he perceived would result from the listingof two species other than the pygmy sculpin. The Anniston Water Works andSewer Board opposed the proposal because they did not believe there wassufficient data to support the listing. The Service discontinued effortsto list the species, and, on November 29, 1979, 2 years after publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the species had not been listed and was thereforeautomatically withdrawn from proposed status in accordance with provisionsof the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and 50 CFR part 424. The most recent proposed rule andthis final rule determination is based upon new threats to the species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</ITAG>In the February 7, 1989, proposed rule and associated notifications, allinterested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. The comment periodexpired on April 10, 1989. Appropriate State agencies, county governments,Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested partieswere contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice was publishedin the ``Gadsden Times'' on February 17, 1989, in ``The Anniston Star''on February 19, 1989; and in the ``Montgomery Advertiser/Alabama Journal''on February 25, 1989, which invited general public comment.Comments were received from a Federal agency, a local government agencyand one private organization and are discussed in the following summary.The State of Alabama provided a comment in support of the proposed listingduring the Service's pre-proposal coordination but did not comment duringthe proposed rules comment period.The Anniston Army Depot did not consider listing of the pygmy sculpin tobe appropriate since, in their view, the species was not threatened byany activities of their installation and that, in their view, their pastand present actions have enhanced the species' protection. The Serviceagrees that removal of toxins that could degrade water quality in the ColdwaterSpring's aquifer is beneficial to this species and we support the Depot'sefforts in this regard. We disagree with the Depot's position that thespecies is not presently threatened by their activities. Cleanup of theshallow aquifer involves the removal of large quantities of groundwaterthat could affect flows at Coldwater Spring. After treatment, this wateris released on the surface representing a loss of flow to the spring. Whilethe cleanup of contaminants is necessary, it is important that spring flowsnot be significantly impacted. Since September 1987, the Depot has beenvery cooperative in providing the Service information on cleanup activities,and the Service expects to continue this cooperation. The determinationto list this species is based on several factors other than just thoseinvolving the Depot, as discussed below in the section titled ``Summaryof Factors Affecting the Species.''The City of Anniston Water Works and Sewer Board recommended the specialrule allow the removal of all spring flow above 3 cubic feet per secondand they provided water flow data that documents these flow levels arenot adverse to the pygmy sculpin. The Service concurs and has so amendedthe special rule. The 6 cubic feet per second specified in the proposedrule was based upon records of previous minimum flows that apparently wereadequate for the sculpin. However, low flows measured during the recentdrought indicate that sculpin survival was not affected when spring outflowwas reduced to half the amount of previously recorded minimums. The changein outflow has no bearing upon sculpin survival in the impounded springhead.The Wildlife Information Center, Inc., commented that the Service yieldedto local and State political influence and that the species should be listedas endangered with critical habitat. The Service's decision to proposethe threatened classification for the pygmy sculpin was based on a scientificevaluation of the threats to the species. Although the pygmy sculpin'shabitat is vulnerable to degradation, threats to the species' survivaldo not appear to be imminent. Therefore, the Service believes that thecategory of threatened is biologically more accurate for this species thanthe category of endangered, as these terms are defined in the EndangeredSpecies Act (Act). It should be noted that the degree of protection affordedto threatened species by section 7(a)(2) of the Act is the same that isgiven to endangered species.Critical habitat was not designated for the pygmy sculpin because the Servicebelieves that no additional benefits would accrue in this case from sucha designation. Because the area occupied by the pygmy sculpin is limited,any adverse effects to its habitat from Federal activities would likelyjeopardize its survival and be considered a violation of section 7(a)(2).It should be emphasized that the listing proposal was based solely on theService's evaluation of biological factors, as required by the Act. Afterthe Service notified interested parties that the pygmy sculpin was underreview for possible listing, the Alabama Department of Conservation andNatural Resources agreed that listing the pygmy sculpin would be appropriate,and it did not express a preference as to endangered or threatened status.On September 17, 1987, the Service also made a presentation on the meritsof a listing proposal to the Commissioners of the Anniston Water and SewerBoard (Board), which owns the species' entire range. At the meeting andin a subsequent letter to Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama, the Board expressedits general agreement to listing the species. The Board made no distinctionbetween a designation of endangered or threatened. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that the pygmy sculpin (<T3>Cottus pygmaeus</T3>) should be classified as a threatened species.Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act and regulations(50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of theAct were followed. A species may be determined to be endangered or threateneddue to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). Thesefactors and their application to the pygmy sculpin (<T3>Cottus pygmaeus</T3>) are as follows: A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof Its Habitat or Range The pygmy sculpin is known to exist in only Coldwater Spring and the springrun. It has never been collected below the confluence of Dry Creek afterwater from these two streams has completely mixed. Thus, its present rangeis also the known historic range. However, the historic range may haveextended downstream of the Dry Creek confluence prior to the occurrenceof environmental pollution, as discussed in Factor E. The pygmy sculpin and its habitat are threatened by the proposed constructionof a highway bypass from Interstate Highway 20 to the City of Anniston.The Alabama Highway Department has identified three alternate routes forthe proposed Anniston Bypass. The early planning preferred route is alongthe side of Coldwater Mountain immediately above and to the east of ColdwaterSpring. The second alternate is to the west of Coldwater Spring. The thirdalternate is an enlargement of the existing road immediately adjacent toand west of Coldwater Spring and the spring run (Carwile <T3>in litt.</T3>). All three of these proposed routes pass through therecharge area for Coldwater Spring (Scott <T3>et al.</T3> 1987). Water in subsurface aquifers moves along fissures,faults and cracks in reaching the aquifer and in returning to the surface.The recharge area for Coldwater Spring is estimated at 90 square milesand includes Coldwater Mountain. Construction of alternate one will bealong the side of Coldwater Mountain and will undoubtedly require the useof explosives in carving out the roadway. This use of explosives mightresult in the shifting and closing of cracks and fissures which allow waterto surface at Coldwater Spring. An additional threat posed by the completion of alternate one is the accidentalspillage of toxic substances. Coldwater Mountain is so steep and the underlyingrock formations of such relatively low permeability that the susceptibilityfor contamination from the mountain is low. However, parallel to ColdwaterMountain and in the valley, is the Jacksonville Fault. The valley has athick residual mantle with underlying cavernous carbonate rocks over theFault. This area is highly susceptible to contamination because sinkholesand depressions on the land surface are common in parts of this rechargearea (Scott <T3>et al. </T3>1987). Any accidental spill from the proposed roadway intothis highly permeable area would likely result in rapid contamination ofColdwater Spring to the detriment of the pygmy sculpin. Alternates twoand three are to the west of Coldwater Spring and do not pose the samemagnitude of threat as alternate one. However, they are still within aportion of the recharge area and the potential for contamination by accidentalspillage does exist. B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationalPurposesColdwater Spring and the spring run are owned and protected from trespassingand collecting by the Anniston Water Works and Sewer Department. As longas this protection exists, this species should not be overutilized. C. Disease or Predation Although the pygmy sculpin may be a prey species for larger carnivorousfish and water snakes, and may be afflicted by diseases and parasites commonto fish, there is no evidence to indicate that natural mortalities fromthese sources are a problem at present. D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms The State of Alabama requires a scientific collector's permit if speciessuch as the pygmy sculpin is to be collected. This species is listed asthreatened by the Alabama Nongame Conference (Mount 1986) and is designateda nongame species by the State of Alabama. As a nongame species, it isunlawful to possess more than four individuals without a scientific collectionpermit. The difficulty of enforcing the permit requirement and the prioritydemands for law enforcement officers' time virtually eliminate any protectionfor this species. Therefore, the most effective protection is providedby a Cooperative Agreement between the Anniston Water Works and Sewer Boardand the Service that no action will be taken which would endanger the pygmysculpin. While this good faith agreement provides protection from actionsunder the control of the Board, it does not provide protection from watercontamination and construction projects discussed in Factors A and E, orfrom other factors beyond the Board's control. E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence Water contamination is occurring in surface water and the subsurface aquiferand is affecting both Coldwater Spring and Dry Creek. Water sampling onand adjacent to the Anniston Army Depot indicates hexavalent chromium isdischarged to Dry Creek and that chlorinated hydrocarbons are in the groundwater at the Depot (Schalla <T3>et al. </T3>1984). Schalla <T3>et al. </T3>conclude that the migration of chlorinated hydrocarbonis not of immediate concern but may have long-range impacts. Trichloroethyleneoccurs in strong concentrations (up to 120,000 parts per billion) in testwells on the Depot and up to 3.4 parts per billion in Coldwater Spring(Environmental Science and Engineering, Inc. 1986). Sampling in 1986 didnot find phenols and hexavalent chromium in Coldwater Spring, yet thesechemicals may be migrating in the aquifer since they are found in testwells 2 and 4 on the Depot. Shallow ground water in the area of these wellslikely contributes to the recharge of the Jacksonville fault zone (Kangas1987). Kangas' assessment indicates that water is lost from the shallowaquifer between the Depot boundary and test well 2. This indicates thatwater from the Depot's shallow aquifer is sinking to a deeper aquifer andpossibly surfacing at Coldwater Spring. The 90 square mile recharge areaincludes several potential contamination sources, including a chemicalmanufacturing industry, Fort McClellan, the City of Anniston, at leastone landfill, and the proposed highway connecting Interstate 20 and StateHighway 202. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the pygmy sculpin as threatened. The determinationof threatened status for the pygmy sculpin was based on a scientific evaluationof the threats to the species. Although the pygmy sculpin's habitat isvulnerable to degradation, threats to the species' survival do not appearto be imminent. Therefore, the Service believes that the category of threatenedis biologically more accurate for this species than the category of endangered,as these terms are defined in the Endangered Species Act. Critical habitatis not designated for reasons given in that section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires, to the maximum extent prudent anddeterminable, that the Secretary designate critical habitat at the sametime the species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent forthis species owing to lack of benefit from such designation. No additionalbenefits would accrue from a critical habitat designation that do not alreadyaccrue from the listing. The only landowner, the City of Anniston, is awareof the pygmy sculpin's occurrence and has provided protection for severalyears under a Conservation Agreement with the Service. Protection of thisspecies' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process and throughthe section 7 jeopardy standard. Therefore, it would not now be prudentto determine critical habitat for the pygmy sculpin.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recover actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individiuals. TheEndangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperationwith the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for alllisted species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionsagainst taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.Federal involvement with this species is expected to include the FederalHighway Administration relative to highway construction, and the EnvironmentalProtection Agency and Department of Defense relative to pollution of thesubsurface aquifer.The Act and implementing regulation found at 50 CFR 17.21 and 17.31 setforth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to allthreatened wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for anyperson subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (includesharass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or toattempt any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce inthe course of a commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstateor foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess,sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has beentaken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service andState conservation agencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingthreatened wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. Such permits are availablefor scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of thespecies, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawfulactivities. For threatened species, there are also permits for zoologicalexhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with thepurposes of the Act.A special rule is provided to clarify the continued use of Coldwater Springas a municipal water supply for the City of Anniston, Coldwater Springand the spring run contain the only known population of this species. Thewithdrawal of substantial quantities of water from the spring has not adverselyimpacted this species, as evidenced by the continued stable populationin the spring and spring run. Under the conditions of the special rule,the use of this spring by the City of Anniston is harmless to the pygmysculpin and continues the protection provided to the species by havinga continuous presence on the property.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Environmental Science and Engineering, Inc. 1986.
