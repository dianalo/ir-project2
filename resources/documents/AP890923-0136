In their first meeting since April, the finance ministers andcentral bank governors of the so-called Group of Seven _ the UnitedStates, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain, France, Canada andItaly _ stepped up their rhetoric aimed at curbing the buoyantdollar, a development threatening to derail improvement in the U.S.trade deficit.   The group had expressed a similar concern last spring, but thetone of the statement released Saturday was considerably stronger,holding out the threat that if the dollar rises any further theeconomic powers would intervene together in world currency markets.   ``The ministers and governors considered the rise in recentmonths of the dollar inconsistent with longer run economicfundamentals,'' the group said in a two-page communique releasedafter the eight-hour meeting.   ``They agreed that a rise of the dollar above current levels ...could adversely affect prospects for the world economy ... (and)agreed to cooperate closely in exchange markets,'' the statementsaid.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady emphasized this part of thecommunique in a briefing for reporters but he refused to say whatspecific actions the countries would be willing to take if thedollar goes higher.   In April, the officials used milder language and simply saidthey agreed that ``a rise of the dollar which undermined adjustmentefforts ... would be counterproductive,'' not any rise.   The group, meeting two hours longer than expected at BlairHouse, across the street from the White House, also addressedtopics ranging from the Third World's crushing $1.3 trillion debtto Western efforts to aid economic reforms in Eastern Europe.   Officials told reporters the extra time was devoted todiscussing events in Poland and Hungary, which the communiquetermed ``historic.''   ``The whole meeting of the G-7 became electric when we startedtalking about the events going on in the Soviet Union and Poland,''Brady said, adding that the finance ministers hoped the 152-nationInternational Monetary Fund would be able to reach quick agreementon a loan package for Poland.   On Third World debt, the communique praised Brady's latestinitiative for achieving ``substantial progress.''   Since the Brady plan was announced in March, commercial bankshave struck tentative agreements granting relief to Mexico and thePhilippines.   Last week, however, three major U.S. banks added more than $4billion to their loss reserves for developing country loans.Analysts are expressing concern that this could signalunwillingness to make enough new money available to sustain growthin the developing nations, most of them in Latin America.   The communique noted the development, saying ``diversifiedfinancial support from the banks is needed to support soundeconomic reform programs through a broad array of new lending anddebt@debt service reduction mechanisms.''   But, it was the group's remarks on the dollar that were mosteagerly awaited by financial markets.   ``That's a much stronger statement against any rise in thedollar,'' said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., agovernment securities dealer. ``I would expect on the heels of thatstatement more aggressive dollar selling from central banks.''   He said the G-7 countries likely now will be willing toaccelerate the decline of the dollar when it is falling on its own,not just counter any rise. And, he speculated that Japan andGermany would show more willingness in the months ahead to raisetheir interest rates as a means of influencing exchange markets.Possibly, he said the Federal Reserve may nudge U.S. rates lower.   An increase in Japanese and West German interest rates wouldmake investing in those countries more attractive and would thusraise the value of their currencies. A cut in interest rates in theUnited States would push the dollar lower.   The G-7 has issued statements in the past pledging to hold thedollar down. But despite heavy intervention in currency markets,efforts have been largely unsuccessful. The volume of privatecurrency trading has grown so huge that it dwarfs any buying orselling that central banks can do.   Since the last G-7 meeting, the dollar has appreciated by about10 percent against the Japanese yen and 3 percent against the WestGerman mark. The dollar on Friday bought 146 yen and 1.95 marks,well above what is presumed to be the upper limit of the tradingrange sought by the Group of Seven _ 140 yen and 1.90 marks.   A strong dollar hurts the trade deficit by raising the price ofU.S. goods on overseas markets while making foreign goods cheaperfor American consumers. The trade gap shrank by 22 percent lastyear, but progress has slowed in 1989, with the deficit shrinkingat only about half of last year's rate.   In addition to the narrow question of exchange rates, financeofficials discussed the broader issue of economic coordination. TheUnited States has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulateconsumer demand in their countries as a means of cutting theirtrade surpluses and reducing the U.S. deficit. The United States,in turn, is being urged to reignite efforts to curb its budgetdeficit, which is believed to contribute to the trade deficit.   The Group of Seven talks were being held before the start of theannual meetings this week of the IMF and its sister lendingorganization, the World Bank.   The G-7 session was preceded by a Group of Five meeting _ theG-7 excluding Canada and Italy _ at the Treasury.   Brady met one-on-one with Ryutaro Hashimoto, the new Japaneseminister of finance, and Pierre Beregovoy, the French financeminister. It was Brady's first meeting with Hashimoto.</TEXT></DOC>
