(records and correspondence).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>TO: Bill Gates FROM: Stewart Alsop RE: Font format for Presentation ManagerandM;You are in the process of making a very important decision, one which couldhave a drastic effect - good or bad - on the industry for a long time tocome.andP;  That decision is how to implement outline fonts in both PresentationManager and Windows.andP;  If you implement outline fonts correctly, you could notonly provide PM and Windows users with lots of choices, and type vendors witha big professional and casual marketplace, but you could also go a long waytoward resolving a growing confusion about tbe role of fonts in personalcomputing.andP;  If you implement them incorrectly, you will only aid thatconfusion and delay unnecessarily the acceptance of typography and otherpublishing tools in everyday computing.andM;The reason your decision is so important is not only because you representIBMs and the so-called IBM-compatible world's interests in this matter, butbecause you are the last major vendor to make tbe decision.andP;  As I've reviewedbefore, there are three basic components to a modem imaging model: the systemfor creating the font outlines in the first place, the software that displaysthe fonts on screen, and tbe file format for the fonts themselves.andP;  (See&quot;Special Report: Imaging Models Are The New Battleground,&quot; Issue 4.21,12-21-88 and &quot;Computer Fonts: The Font Wars Open Up Adobe, Sort 0f&quot; Issue5.05, 3-14-89.) What approach a vendor takes to implementing these threepieces indicates how well the vendor is balancing its own interests (which isfundamentally to sell lots of hardware and maintain a differentiatedadvantage over competitors), the interests of end users (who buy the hardwarein the first place and are attracted by systems that let them get their workdone and don't force them to spend a lot of time managing incompatibilities)against tbe type vendors (who are not interested in suddenly having the verytypefaces for which they have historically charged hundreds of dollars inlicensing fees suddenly become commodity goods).andP;  In other words, computervendors really want (in their hearts) to sell to the largest audiencepossible, not just to publishing professionals.andP;  And type vendors arefundamentally uninterested in selling to non-professionals, sinceprofessionals are the ones that have both the money and training to recognizethe difference between typefaces and pay handsomely for that difference.andM;As a result of these different attitudes, the computer vendors and typevendors rank the importance of the three components differently.andP;  The systemfor creating font outlines for new typefaces is crucial to type vendors(because it determines how productive their workers can be), but onlymarginally important to computer vendors (since they aren't doing the work toproduce new font outlines).andP;  The system for displaying fonts on screen iscrucial to computer vendors (because it is a key factor in determining theperceived performance of the computer), and only marginally important to thetype vendor (since they aren't in tbe computer business).andP;  The file format isjust about equally important to both parties, although they are fundamentallyopposed about how proprietary that format should be.andP;  The degree ofproprietariness affects both the number of typefaces that become availablefor any particular computer system (computer vendors like to be able toprovide their users with a broad selection of high quality typefaces) and tbepricing of those typefaces (type vendors want to be able to controldistribution of their typefaces so that they continue to charge professionalsa commercial price).andP;  So a proprietary format will produce fewer, moreexpensive fonts, it is believed, and an open format will produce lots ofinexpensive fonts.andP;  Font vendors want fonts to remain proprietary; computervendors want them to be open.andM;Okay, so that sets up tbe basic issue.andP;  As I said, you are the last majorcomputer vendor to make a decision about how to implement outline fonts.andO;Before we get to bow you might have a real impact in this area, let's reviewthe decision the otber vendors have made, in order of their announcement.andM;By being tbe first to describe a notion of a &quot;unified imaging model&quot; - wherethe same system for rasterizing fonts and other graphics was used for bothscreen display and any other form of output - Next managed to focus theentire industry's attention on this issue.andP;  It was easier for Next to solvethe problem than virtually any other vendor because it is a new company withno product history or installed base.andP;  Indeed, Next made its decision aboutoutline fonts part of the entire sales pitch for tbe Next computer.andP;  Itadopted the Adobe Postscript interpreter for both screen display and printeroutput.andP;  That decision meant that it inherited all of the work tbat Adobe baddone in generating a large and high-quality type library (something that cantake more than two years for a new file format, even wben the type vendorsare enthusiastic about the format).andP;  It also inherited Adobe's problems withperformance, which Next solved partially by building a very fast computer andpartially by doing a lot of the work of rewriting the Adobe interpreter forscreen display.andP;  It also inherited Adobe's proprietary approach to font fileformats, so that the only fonts available for the Next machine are the onesproduced by Adobe-approved type vendors.andP;  So the net effect, as far as Nextis concemed, is that publishing professionals are going to be overjoyed withthe Next system: iVs faster than any computer they are likely to have usedbefore, it carries all of the credibility that Adobe Systems has built foritsel ,f and it has a great set of fonts and type vendors already in place.andO;Regular business users and workstation users, neither of whom have had muchexperience using fonts in dayto-day work, will probably say that the computeris expensive (business users) or slow (workstation users).andP;  And that's whyNext's first targeted marketing campaign is being focused on &quot;workstationpublishing.&quot;andM;Sun Microsystems was the first existing system vendor to announce itsapproach to outline fonts, and it did so, well before any of tbe othervendors bad really understood how important fonts are.andP;  Sun made its decisionby purchasing a type vendor (then called Folio), making the Folio technologyfor creating (called Typemaker) and displaying (called Typescaler) outlinefonts very inexpensive, and putting the font file format into the publicdomain so that anyone could use it.andP;  Clearly, Sun is acting exactly as youwould expect a computer vendor to act: since its interest is in selling asmany computers as it can, it is trying to make fonts as cheap and widelyavailable as possible.andP;  And, in its role as a major system vendor in the Unixworld, it managed to get several major type vendors - primarily Linotype andMonotype - to endorse its approach.andP;  But it gained those endorsements beforeeither Apple or IBM had clearly stated their approaches.andP;  And in light ofApple's recently announced approach (described below), Adobe's attempt togeneralize Postscript (also described below), and your imminent decision, itcould well be that the major type vendors will put Sun in a third- orfourth-priority position for development of new typefaces or digitizing oldones, even though the Sun approach (particularly Typemaker) makes digitizingfonts for the Sun system very quick and easy.andP;  The fact is that type vendorswill go where the money is, and Sun has made font making so simple that fontsare likely to become commodities on Sun machines, at least compared to othersystems.andM;Apple Computer, of course, is tbe company that made publishing on computersan issue in tbe first place.andP;  So its decision about how to enable outlinescreen fonts on the Macintosh has been awaited with bated breath by allparties.andP;  Whatever Apple did, it had already made clear that it would dosomething every existing Macintosh user could use and therefore was going toprovide an instant 2-3 million unit marketplace for its outline screen fonts.andO;What Apple did, when it announced its new System 7.0 last spring, was exactlywhat you would expect Apple to do.andP;  Instead of picking a particular typevendor, Apple created its own, proprietary system for displaying outlinescreen fonts, but put the format (called the Royal format) for distributingthose fonts into the public domain.andP;  The result is that type vendors must belicensed by Apple in order to be able to produce Royal fonts, but don't haveto have Apple actually distribute or enable tbe use of the fonts (as they dowith Adobe).andP;  Given Apple's predominant position in both the professional andbusiness-oriented publishing markets, the type vendors have unanimouslyannounced support for Apple's approach and have said that they will producetheir entire libraries in the Royal family (which is apparently not an easything to do, at least compared to Sun's approach).andP;  Apple has said that itand other vendors will produce a complete range of devices that can takeoutput directly from Quickdraw using the Royal font format.andP;  While Apple saysit will continue to provide support for Postscript, particularly forprofessional users on highend output devices (like the Laserwriter NTX andtypesetting equipment), it has also provided an end-to-end solution forday-to-day business use that bypasses Postscript entirely and promises toreduce the price of laser-quality output dramatically for Macintosh users.andM;Adobe Systems is the other company that made publishing on computers acompetitive issue.andP;  And Adobe has a clearly established strategy of creatinga proprietary font distribution and rendering format, a strategy that isoriented toward making type vendors happy and producing a profitablefont-selling business for Adobe itself As it stands, only laser printers andother output devices with an Adobe controller can render and display Adobefonts.andP;  Those devices can render other font formats, but not with the samequality or consistency as Adobe fonts.andP;  Since it is not a computer vendor,Adobe is trying to establish tbe Postscript Display interpreter as amachine-independent system for displaying fonts on screen in the same waythat it established so-called Printer Postscript as a machine-independentsystem.andP;  The problem is that printers aren't in the machine, unlike thescreen interface, and therefore the system vendors have no problem supportingan &quot;open standard&quot;for printing.andP;  But once the interface moves inside themachine, particularly if tbat interface now covers both tbe screen and theprinter, computer vendors suddenly feel threatened if they don't own thesystem themselves.andP;  (Even Sun, the prototypic open-systems company, wanted toown the system for displaying fonts, although it would have been a lotsimpler for Sun to license Display Postscript.) Unfortunately, Adobe hasfailed to adjust its strategy to account for this difference.andP;  Thus its onlymajor adoptions for Display Postscript to date - Digital Equipment Corp.andP;  andNext - are very small players in the general personal computer market and areeven relatively small players in the workstation market (altbough DEC ismaking a concerted run at Sun in the latter market).andP;  And it has already lostboth Sun and Apple.andP;  And, if rumor be believed, it hasn't made much progresswith Microsoft and IBM...andM;So what should Microsoft and EBM do? (I am treating the decision as one thatwill be made by Microsoft with a very, very big influence from IBM, forobvious reasons.) The range of options you have has pretty much beendelineated by the decision made by tbe other vendors I've reviewed.andP;  1) Youcould make a relationship witb an existing type vendor.andP;  The leadingprospects are: Adobe (already aligned with Next), Bitstream (unaligned), AgfaCompugraphic (already aligned with Hewlett-Packard), and URW (unaligned).andO;This relationship could be anything from a simple licensing of theirtype-scaling software to a full-fledged acquisition, with many stops inbetween.andP;  2) You could write your own software and create a new font format.andO;3) You could make an alliance with one of the otber system vendors, namelyNext, Sun, or Apple.andM;After a lot of thought about the competitive implications, your objectives,and the technical issues (to tbe degree that I understand them), l believethat the absolute best choice for Microsoft is to adopt Apple's Royal format.andO;You're probably dropping trow in amazement that I'm suggesting that youlicense something from a company thats suing you over tbe last time youlicensed something from it (namely the Macintosh interface).andP;  But think aboutit for a minute before you try to find something more interesting to read.andM;*The fact is that Apple's approach to displaying outline fonts is technicallyinteresting and is specifically tuned to providing good perceived performanceon relatively slow machines.andP;  You bave the same problem tbat Apple does,which is that you have to enable adequate performance on all those 80286machines to the same degree that Apple has to enable performance on all those68000 machines.andP;  (Lees politely write off the 8088-8086 machines, ehhh?) Noneof tbe other systems take tbis problem into account: both Display Postscriptand Sun's Typescaler need workstation level throughput to provide decentperformance.andM;*As well, Apple is tbe undisputed king of tbe publishing world at this time.andO;The company's share of market in newspapers, in magazines, in copy shops, inadvertising agencies, even in corporate offices, is such that it is tbetouchstone for new developments in laser printing, typeface development, andpage composition and graphics software.andP;  By following Apple's lead, you notonly take advantage of the company's lead in the marketplace, you also putyourself in a position to synthesize and co-opt that leadership.andM;*Most importantly, users - both end users and MIS managers - as well asoutput-device developers will love you.andP;  You will create a single font-formatstandard so that users trying to mix PCs and Macintoshes (a much more commonsituation tban mixing Macintoshes and Nexts or Suns, or mixing PCs and Nextsor Suns) won't have to worry about what kind of fonts tbey use.andP;  And outputdevice makers will be able to focus on using the latest technologies and onmaking great products, instead of worrying about the political situation andwho tbeir friends are.andM;*Last but not least, you can solve yours and IBM's font problem quickly witblittle work (other tban the emotional effort required to overcome youraversion to licensing from Apple), so tbat you can focus on finishing the80386 version of OS/2, giving Windows and Presentation Manager a complete andintegrated desktop metaphor, making networking a real part of the operatingsystem, and all the other issues that are worth more of your attention tbanone that's already been solved by another company.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
