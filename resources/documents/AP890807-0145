WELCH</BYLINE><UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thirty states raised taxes in thepost-election year legislative sessions of 1989, including sixstates that enacted broad increases in personal income taxes, asurvey of the states shows.   Net tax cuts were set for the coming year in another 11 states,although in most cases the cuts were small.   Passed despite intense political opposition to federal taxincreases voiced by President Bush and others, the state actionsare expected to produce a net increase in revenue amounting to $3.5billion in fiscal 1990.   That is only a fraction of the $280 billion in revenue of allthe 50 states, but compares to a small net tax decrease of theprevious year, according to the survey conducted by the NationalConference of State Legislatures.   ``The high level of activity this year is typical of apost-election year, since states tend to avoid tax increases whenan election is looming immediately ahead,'' said Steven Gold,director of fiscal studies for the conference.   The survey was part of a broader report being released today atthe Conference of State Legislatures' annual meeting in Tulsa, Okla.   Some states approved packages raising several taxes, such asIllinois, where the total was projected at more than $1 billion andnearly 10 percent of state revenue last year, and Connecticut,where the increase topped $800 million, or 18 percent of staterevenue.   ``In Illinois, when we think something is important, we'rewilling to pay for it,'' Republican Gov. Jim Thompson said.   The largest income tax increases came in Illinois,Massachusetts, Connecticut, North Dakota, Vermont and Montana, thesurvey said. In Connecticut, the tax applies only to dividends,interest and capital gains, not earned income.   The tax increase total would have been even larger but for NewYork. Although the New York legislature passed a number ofincreases in taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and corporations, NewYork was counted in the survey as a net tax decrease because of a$1.2 billion income tax reduction passed in 1987 and scheduled totake effect in October, Gold said.   Taxes were raised in all regions of the country. In New England,where an economic slowdown has hit states that only a few years agowere booming, five of six states raised taxes, and only Maine cutthem.   ``To a considerable extent, the most serious state fiscaldifficulties were in the Northeast, including New England states,New York and New Jersey,'' Gold said.   ``Their budget problems follow a four-year period when they wereamong the fiscally strongest states in the nation. Most of themincreased their budgets substantially and reduced taxes during thatperiod, setting them up for problems this year.''   Hawaii, where a budget surplus was projected, passed permanentincome tax reductions plus a one-time rebate of $125 per person.Kansas and Maine also cut income taxes, according to the survey.   Hawaii was the only state where tax cuts totaled more than 5percent of revenue. Wisconsin cut taxes 3 percent.   Gasoline and ``sin'' taxes were the most popular targets forincreases, the survey found.   Sixteen states increased their motor fuels taxes by at least onecent per gallon; 13 states raised cigarette taxes and seven raisedtaxes on alcoholic beverages. Corporate income taxes were increasedin five states.   Sales taxes were increased in Georgia, Connecticut, North Dakotaand Kansas, and West Virginia extended it to cover food.Connecticut also broadened the tax to cover services such asarchitectural design, consulting, lobbying, public relations,repairs and some advertising.   Many other miscellaneous taxes were raised, including increasesin real estate transfer taxes in six states. States areincreasingly turning to taxes on real estate sales as a source ofrevenue, Gold said.   ``States want to raise money without interfering with theeconomy,'' he said. ``When you're talking about hundreds ofthousands of dollars for selling property, and paying 6 percent ormore to an agent, the state taking 1 or 1 and a half percent moredoesn't seem to make that much difference to people.''   According to the survey, the following states have passed nettax increases amounting to 5 percent or more of state revenue,taking effect in the next fiscal year: Alaska, Connecticut,Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, North Dakota, Rhode Island andWest Virginia.   Raising taxes by 3 percent to 5 percent were: Nevada, NorthCarolina, Tennessee and Vermont.   Raising taxes 1 percent to 3 percent were: Arizona, Colorado,Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, Nebraska, Ohio, Oregon andWyoming.   Raising taxes less than 1 percent were: Arkansas, Florida,Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, SouthCarolina, Washington.   States listed as lowering taxes more than 1 percent were:Hawaii, Wisconsin, Louisiana, New York, Virginia and Texas. Taxeswere lowered less than 1 percent in Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Marylandand South Dakota.</TEXT></DOC>
