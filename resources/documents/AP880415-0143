The military went on nationwide alert this week to guard againstany coup attempt while President Corazon Aquino was visitin China.   Chief military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said those arrestedincluded eight navy guards who helped former Lt. Col. Gregorio``Gringo'' Honasan escape his prison ship 13 days ago. Honasan ledthe attempted coup last Aug. 28.   The failed coup in August left at least 53 people dead and morethan 300 others wounded. Among those hurt was Mrs. Aquino's onlyson, Benigno Aquino III.   Florendo said the operation was continuing but that Honasanremained at large. Honasan had been detained on the navy ship sincehis arrest last December in a Manila suburb.   Col. Emiliano Templo, leader of the raiding party, told TheAssociated Press that the military learned of a plot to attack thepresidential compound ``so we acted quickly. We pre-empted theplan.''   Templo said the conspirators allegedly planned to approach thepalace by rubber boats, traveling down a nearby stream which flowsinto the Pasig river. The presidential palace is on the banks ofthe Pasig in the heart of Manila.   Templo did not say when the attack was to have been carried out.Government television reported that the raids foiled ``adestabilization plan'' which was to have been launched Friday night.   Mrs. Aquino left Thursday for a four-day visit to China and HongKong. It was her first trip abroad since visiting Japan in November1986.   Florendo said Mrs. Aquino was notified of the raids by telephonein Beijing and ``she was delighted with what happened.''   Mrs. Aquino met Friday with Chinese Premier Li Peng andPresident Yang Shangkun. Mrs. Aquino and Li agreed that their rivalclaims to the Spratly Islands should be settled peacefully, aPhilippine spokesman said.   Li and Shangkun also said they would take steps to reduceChina's large trade surplus with the Philippines, according toTeodoro Benigno, Mrs. Aquino's spokesman.   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, commander of the National CapitalRegional Defense Command, said three Marine companies and 30 policeand soldiers carried out the raids in the swank Blue Ridge districtof suburban Quezon City.   He said the raid on the house where the 10 men were found lastedonly 15 minutes, and there was no resistance. Florendo said up toeight houses were raided, but all those arrested were found in onedwelling.   They included Lt. Gerardo Mojica, commander of the securityforce aboard the ship from which Honasan escaped. Two of thosearrested were civilians, Biazon said.   Troops seized 16 M-14 rifles, four M-16s, one light machine gun,five Israeli-made Uzi machine guns, five radio sets, a grenadelauncher, several grenades and ammunition.   Florendo told reporters that the 10 denied planning any attacks.   Last week, Honasan said in a statement that he was withdrawing apledge made a month before his arrest that he would refrain from``hostile acts'' against the Aquino government.   Earlier Friday, the military announced the filing of the firstmutiny charges against officers linked to Honasan's failed coup.   Military spokesman Lt. Anselmo Cabingan said those formallycharged included two lieutenant colonels, a major and twolieutenants. They were to be arraigned before a military courtMonday, he said.   In other developments, police clashed Friday with stone-throwingleftists near the U.S. Embassy and blocked a nearby march bymilitant Moslems protesting U.S. bombing raids on Libya two yearsago. Two demonstrators and one policeman were injured in the clash.</TEXT></DOC>
