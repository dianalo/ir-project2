<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-40-0461 </DOCNO><TEXT>The BCG code for determining the space and energy neutron flux distributionand criticality of fast reactor cylindrical cells is presented. The codesolves the unidimensional neutron transport equation together with interfacecurrent relations at each energy in an unionized grid prepared for thecell and at an arbitrary number of spatial zones. While the spatial resolutionis user specified, the energy dependence of the flux distribution isresolved according to the degree of variation in the reconstructed totalmicroscopic cross sections of the atomic species in the cell. Resultsfor a defined sample problem illustrate the high resolution and accuracythat can be obtained with the code.</TEXT></DOC>
