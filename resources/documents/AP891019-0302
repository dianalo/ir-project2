Energy prices, which had climbed sharply at the wholesale level,raising the expectation of an increase on the retail level, fellfor the fourth consecutive month in September, the Labor Departmentsaid.   Jittery stock and bond markets rallied on the news, taking thefavorable inflation number as a sign the Federal Reserve Board hasleeway to nudge interest rates lower. At noon EDT, the Dow Jonesindustrial average was up 31.35 points to 2,675.00.   Michael Boskin, chief economic adviser to President Bush, calledthe data ``good economic news.'' He added: ``We're delighted to beable to say that, while we're always on guard to make sure thatinflation remains under control, the concern earlier in the yearthat inflation was getting out of control appears to have beenunfounded.''   Also, the report triggered an announcement that the nation's38.9 million Social Security recipients will get a 4.7 percentbenefit increase in January to offset the effects of inflation overthe past year.   The cost-of-living increase is determined by comparing theConsumer Price Index in the July-September quarter with the sameperiod of last year.   The average recipient will see his or her benefits increased by$25 a month to $566.   At the same time, the cap on Social Security payroll taxes willrise. Workers will have to pay the tax on their first $50,400 inwages, up from $48,000.   Meanwhile, in a separate report, the department said Americans'average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, rose 0.3percent in September following a 0.7 percent decline in August.   Average weekly earnings in September were $338.67, up 3.5percent from a year earlier. But, when inflation is taken intoaccount, real weekly earnings were down.   Consumer prices rose at a high annual rate of 6.7 percent forthe first five months of the year, driven up by rising gasolineprices.   However, the index has risen only 0.2 percent or remained flatin each of the last four months, bringing the annual rate down to4.4 percent for the first three quarters, the same as the rate forall of 1988 and 1987.   ``This shows clearly that inflation is under control. ... Underthese circumstances, there is no question that interest rates willfall,'' said economist William K. MacReynolds of the U.S. Chamberof Commerce.   But, economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicagosaid the September report overstates the decline in inflation andwarned of higher energy prices ahead.   ``There has been an abatment, but it hasn't been to the degreethis number would suggest. We're likely to have some lessattractive numbers in the fourth quarter,'' he said.   Gasoline prices, down 2.2 percent in September, have declined9.3 percent in the past four months after increasing 21.2 percentin the first five months of the year.   Fuel oil prices fell 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.9percent in August.   However, analysts don't expect the trend to persist becausecrude oil prices have been rising.   Food prices, which were surging earlier in the year, rose amoderate 0.2 percent last month, in part because of a 1.1 percentdecline for fruits and vegetables.   Food and beverage prices, which shot up at a 9.3 percent annualrate through May, from June to September climbed at only a 1.7percent rate.   Also down last month were coffee, 2.7 percent, and fats and oilsand non-alcoholic beverages.   However, the index for dairy products jumped 1.4 percent, thelargest monthly increase since May 1980.   Clothing prices, after falling in the three previous months,rose 1.7 percent in September. Apparel for women and girls,reflecting the introduction of new fall and winter fashions, wereup 3.6 percent.   The various changes left the overall Consumer Price Index at125.0 in September, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goodsand services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base period would havecost $125 last month.   The Social Security benefit increase is based on a narrowerindex that reflects costs for urban wage earners and clericalworkers. That index was 123.6.   In advance of the report, most economists were expecting aninflation figure approximately double the 0.2 percent reported inSeptember.   The more modest rise may provide room for the Federal ReserveBoard to reduce interest rates. The central bank has been fightinginflation by trying to slow the economy with higher interest rates.   In response to the stock market gyrations, the central bank thisweek has allowed the interest rate for overnight loans betweenbanks to decline about one-quarter percentage point to 8.75 percent.   With today's inflation number, most analysts now believe the Fedwill allow the rate to fall further, or at least refrain frompushing it back up once market turmoil has subsided.   In another report emphasizing the economy's softness, the LaborDepartment said new state unemployment claims for the week endingOct. 7 increased 62,000 from the previous week to 396,000.</TEXT></DOC>
