In administrative proceedings, the Securities and ExchangeCommission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commissioncharged the firm with failing to maintain sufficient capitalsince December. In addition, the CFTC charged Stotler withoverstating the amount of capital held by the firm. The SECalso said the firm failed to file documents and kept outdatedand improper records of capital levels and of positions inthe government-securities markets.</LP><TEXT>   The firm, which last month closed its doors because of alack of capital, settled the CFTC charges, agreeing to haveits license revoked and promising the agency it wouldcooperate with a continuing CFTC investigation, thecommodities regulator said. But Stotler didn't settle the SECcharges, and the case is scheduled to be heard by an SECadministrative law judge. The SEC also regulates thecommodities broker because the firm trades government bonds.Stotler officials couldn't be reached for comment.   CFTC enforcement director Dennis Klejna said the agenciesknew of each other's charges, and that &quot;as far as we'reconcerned this is an ongoing investigation.&quot; William Hegan,the SEC's deputy regional administrator in Chicago, said thatthe agency &quot;regards net capital as a serious violation. Itgoes to the heart of the business.&quot;   The charges are the latest in a series of setbacks for Mr.Mahlmann, Stotler and its parent Stotler Group Inc. Mr.Mahlmann, who has said that he hasn't been involved in thefirms' daily operations, hasn't been charged with anywrongdoing by either regulatory agency. But he recentlyresigned as head of the CBOT in the wake of charges againstcommodity pool operations run by a Stotler unit.   In those charges, the CFTC said the pool operator, StotlerFunds, violated anti-fraud laws by effectively making $5.5million in loans from two pools to parent Stotler Group. Thatmoney represented customer funds that investors were toldwould be invested in commodities, the CFTC said. Mr. Mahlmannrecently resigned as a director of Stotler Funds and chairmanof Stotler Group.   Early this month, Stotler Group was forced intoinvoluntary bankruptcy proceedings by the commodity funds itmanaged, which said that the group owed them more than $5million.   More disciplinary steps against Stotler Group, its unitsand possibly its officers are expected in the next few monthsas details become known surrounding the collapse of what hadbeen one of the country's biggest futures brokerage firms.Futures regulators have said they may also refer certainaspects of Stotler Group's collapse to the U.S. attorney forpossible criminal prosecution.   Mr. Mahlmann, 52 years old, has asserted that he knewnothing of the loans made by the funds and hasn't beeninvolved in the day-to-day management of Stotler Group fortwo years. But he became the first CBOT chairman in 130 yearsto resign from the nation's largest futures exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
