Movies, court cases, a radio drama and the recent electioncampaign have created a flood of pressure on this island of 20million to confront its past.   The boom has also given voice to native Taiwanese, who make up85 percent of the population but have had scant political influencesince 1949 when the Nationalist Party seized power after losing acivil war to the Communists on mainland China.   ``We are awakening after a long sleep,'' says Antonio Chiang,editor of the prestigious Journalist magazine. ``We are finallylearning who we are, where we came from.''   Taiwanese have always regarded their rocky island as ``theorphan of Asia,'' as a popular song goes. Since the 17th century,they have been ruled by Spaniards, Dutch, Japanese and Chinese fromthe mainland.   When the Nationalists took power, they imposed the culture ofthe mainland on the little island. Mandarin Chinese replacedTaiwanese dialect in the classroom and students were fined if theyspoke the local patois. Taiwanese history was dominated by Chinesehistory.   Only fools or gangsters spoke Taiwanese on TV.   ``I don't know how many times my teacher made me stand with aboard around my neck, saying `I`ll never speak Taiwanese again,'''said Chen Shui-pien, a leading opposition politician. ``Themainlanders made us feel like Taiwanese natives were second-classcitizens.''   A change came in 1987 when then-President Chiang Ching-kuo ended38 years of martial law. Taiwan's astounding economic growth hadcreated an increasingly sophisticated population which no longertolerated harsh political repression.   The government relaxed its tight controls on the press,legalized opposition political parties and began tolerating somedissent.   A further boon to the cultural boom came in June, when CommunistChinese troops in Beijing crushed a pro-democracy movement. Thetragedy in Tiananmen Square sparked Taiwanese to probe Nationalistabuses.   In October, ``City of Sorrow,'' an award-winning film, opened inTaiwan to packed houses. The movie was the first to explore theFeb. 28, 1947 massacre, when Nationalist troops slaughtered tens ofthousands of Taiwanese after clashes between island natives andmainland immigrants.   A deaf-mute plays the central role and witnesses the horrors _ apowerful metaphor for Taiwan's silenced intellectuals.   In its portrayal of a gangster clan, the movie probes thepolitically sensitive question of organized crime's influence overpolitics. Ironically, the film is reported to be backed by ganglandmoney.   A wildy-popular radio drama also has its roots in Taiwan's past_ the Japanese occupation from 1895-1945. Liao Tien-ting isTaiwan's Robin Hood, who robs Japanese imperialists and gives tothe poor.   The show draws thinly veiled parallels between Japan'soccupation and Nationalist government domination in Taiwan. Itsannouncer has entered politics and is a strong supporter of theopposition Democratic Progressive Party.   Taiwan's recent election campaign, the first multiparty race inits history, also made use of the past and Taiwanese culture.   One successful candidate for the Legislature, Yeh Chu-lan,advocated independence from China, a seditious act under theConstitution. Her victory gave voice to an undercurrent of support,especially among native Taiwanese, for cutting all ties withBeijing.   Taiwanese folk songs filled the air at her rallies. A guerrillatheater troupe acted out scenes of alleged Nationalist brutality _the 1947 killings and the death of Yeh's husband, a dissident whoimmolated himself in April to escape police interrogation.   The troupe also portrayed scenes from a 1979 riot in thesouthern city of Kaohsiung.   On Dec. 10, 1979, tens of thousands of people demonstrated inKaohsiung for human rights and hundreds were injured in a brawl.The government rounded up more than 150 dissidents and dozens weresentenced to long jail terms.   A celebrated court case has also returned attention to thebloody clash. In September, fugitive dissident Hsu Hsin-liang,wanted for allegedly fomenting the riot, was arrested as he triedto slip into Taiwan on a fishing boat.   Hsu's case sparked exposes in the increasingly free press.   In October, the Journalist claimed police used torture andintimidation to extract confessions of participants in the riot.Other reports have called for an investigation of the killings ofthe wife and daughter of one of the Kaohsiung dissidents, LinYi-hsiung, jailed after the clash.   ``The government should have forgetten the case and welcomed Hsuback,'' said opposition figure Chen, also Hsu's attorney.``Instead, they were too worried about losing face, so they'reprosecuting him. That has opened up this old wound and theopposition is profiting from the controversy.''   Some intellectuals oppose this use of Taiwan's history andculture as a political weapon.   Hou Hsiao-hsien, who directed ``City of Sorrow,'' says he madethe movie to return history to the people.   ``The Nationalists and the opposition are using the February 28incident like a trump card,'' he said in a recent interview. ``Themovie was my way of butting into their card game and turning thetrump card over. February 28 is our history, it doesn't belong topolitical parties.''   President Lee Teng-hui, the country's first native Taiwaneseleader, has asked his people to forget about the ugly past and lookto the future.   But, Hou counters: ``If we don't talk about it now, we aredoomed to repeat it.''</TEXT></DOC>
