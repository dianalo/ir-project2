Simons, chairman and chief executive officer, said.    Capital is the nation's third-largest shareholder-owned life insurer, with $42.1 billion in coverage in effect at March 31.    Mr. Simons's estimate indicates that second-quarter profit before capital gains were up 9% to 11% from the $37.8 million, or 71 cents a share, posted for the second quarter of 1986, when capital gains of $30.8 million made net income $68.6 million, or $1.32 a share.    Mr. Simons said Capital is on track toward another record year in after-tax profit, excluding capital gains. For 1987, he said he expects earnings of $160 million to $170 million, or $3.20 to $3.30 a share, before capital gains. In 1986, Capital earned $155.1 million, or $2.92 a share, before capital gains of $118.3 million increased net to $273.4 million, or $5.25 a share.    &quot;Excluding capital gains and losses, 1987 will be a record year for us,&quot; Mr. Simons said. He said he expects the increase in such profit this year to be &quot;around the midteens, . . . a rate we haven't achieved in the nine years that I've been here.&quot;    Mr. Simons added that he expects similar earnings growth in 1988. Within five years, he added, Capital will likely double earnings and assets.    Capital is looking at small and medium-sized companies that will help it expand further into consumer financial services, but Mr. Simons said he doesn't foresee another purchase within six months.    An unusual marketing experiment is working well for Capital. Under a program begun in 1983, agents sell insurance to shoppers in 15 Kroger Co. supermarkets in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio and Alabama. Within a year, Capital will at least double the number of stores involved, Mr. Simons said. Agents at those outlets sell about 30% more insurance than the company's other agents. &quot;It's a very efficient way to meet customers,&quot; Mr. Simons said.    Noting that concern over the effects of claims by victims of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome has hurt some insurance stocks, Mr. Simons said he believes the near-term public health threat posed by the disease has been exaggerated.    But to minimize effects of AIDS claims against it, Capital has restricted the size of policies it writes in such high-risk areas as Washington, D.C. It said it set up a $5 million reserve for AIDS-related losses in 1986, but has no plans to add to it. </TEXT></DOC>
