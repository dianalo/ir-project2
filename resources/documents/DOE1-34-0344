The preferred habit minimizes the elasticenergy, which depends on the elastic constants of the inclusion and thetransformation strain connecting the lattices of the inclusion and thematrix. The paper presents four principal results concerning the preferredthin-plate habit. First the mathematical conditions that determine thepreferred habit are derived in compact form. These conditions are alwayssatisfied when the transformation strain is dyadic and the habit is perpendicularto a vector of the dyad, reproducing a result that is given by Khatchaturyanand included in the crystallographic theory of precipitate habits. Theextremal conditions are solved for orthorhombic symmetry, that is, whenthe elastic constants of the inclusion have orthorhombic symmetry withrespect to the principal axes of the transformation stress. The resultsincorporate isotropic, cubic, hexagonal and tetragonal (type II) symmetries.They are specialized to determine the minimum-energy habit as a functionof the transformation strain for three classes of inclusions: isotropicinclusions, cubic inclusions with tetragonal transformation strains,and hexagonal inclusions with hexagonal transformation strains. Finallyit is shown by counter-example that there is no general algebraic solutionfor systems of arbitrary symmetry.</TEXT></DOC>
