It appears to be the largest cutback by anairline attributed to the war. TWA said 2,500 of its workers would be laidoff.;    Pan Am, the nation's other major trans-Atlantic carrier, said itsexecutives were meeting to determine whether they should do likewise.;    &quot;Ourbookings are getting hurt, and we are finding a large no-show factor on ourAtlantic routes,&quot; Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said.;    Other carriers,including American Airlines, United Airlines and Northwest Airlines, saidMonday they had no plans to scrap any service over the Atlantic.;    AmericanAirlines, which has been hit by a &quot;sick-out&quot; by pilots, said staffingdifficulties have been aggravated by the large number of pilots who have beencalled to active reserve duty for Operation Desert Storm.;    The airline haslost 350 pilots out of its force of 8,700 to active reserve duty. Two of theairlines' planes are being used by the U.S. military for Operation DesertStorm, spokesman Tim Smith said. But the airline hasn't been affected by thegovernment's call for more cargo planes because it doesn't have any planesdesigned to solely carry cargo, he said.;    Changes in service to the gulfare occurring daily, making it hard to determine which airlines are stillflying to the region.;    The consensus among travel industry executivesMonday was that of more than 20 major carriers that normally serve the regiononly a handful were continuing to fly into Israel, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.;   El Al Israel Airlines and Tower Air were still flying to Tel Aviv. Saudia wasstill flying to Riyadh out of Frankfurt and Paris, and Royal Jordanian wasstill flying to Amman.;    Sheryl Stein, the manager of public relations forEl Al, said it was continuing daily service from John F. Kennedy InternationalAirport in New York to Tel Aviv. She said the carrier had not reduced itsschedule and it had 17 flights Monday in and out of Tel Aviv to other parts ofthe world.;    Some carriers, including Pan American World Airways and TWA,began to suspend service before the war started as insurance rates on flightssoared.;    Fears of terrorist attacks related to the war have also frightenedmany travelers who had booked trips to Europe.;    Airline industry analystssaid that even though the fall in traffic to Europe is an unwelcome problemthat could persist if the war drags on, the troubles began at their mostoptimal time. Winter months historically are the slowest time fortrans-Atlantic travel.;    Otherwise, the immediate consequences of the gulfwar have not all been bad for the airlines.;    Oil prices took many businessstrategists by surprise last week by falling more than $10 per barrel tolevels unseen since before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Though the price ofcrude rebounded a bit Monday, oil experts said it would probably not move backto the peaks hit in the weeks after the invasion, when crude moved brieflyabove $40 per barrel.;    Throughout the fall, airlines had been suffering theeffects of jet fuel prices that had virtually doubled from around 60 cents agallon to more than $1.20 per gallon.;    The airlines would also benefit frommore government business, as they ship people and equipment into the MiddleEast, analysts said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff and Wire Report  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910122  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  673  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 22, 199100022119,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
