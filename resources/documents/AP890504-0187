Throughout this, my family and I have beensustained by the support and the love and the kindness and theprayers of the American people. Without them and their love, andthe grace of God, there is no way we could have endured the lengthof this ordeal.   ``Certainly I hoped that this battle would be behind us by now,but today's was not a complete victory. After more than two and ahalf years and over $40 million of our taxpayers' money spent oninvestigations, congressional inquisitions and now a specialprosecutor who has likened me to Adolf Hitler, we now face manymonths and perhaps years of fighting the remaining charges.Nonetheless, we are absolutely confident of the final outcome. As aMarine, I was taught to fight and fight hard, for as long as ittakes to prevail. We will continue this battle and with the supportand prayers of the American people, we will be fully vindicated.''</TEXT></DOC>
