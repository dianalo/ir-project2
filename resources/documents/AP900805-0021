A week after the chefs of the American Culinary Federationstaged their 1990 Culinary Mardi Gras, Overeaters Anonymousgathered this weekend to celebrate the group's 30 years of helpingpeople recover from compulsive overeating.   ``It is ironic, but it's really neat in a way. It points outthat our program isn't just about food. It's about how we're livingour lives,'' said Kathy, who has been involved in OA for 10 years.   Kathy, who like most members of the organization doesn't revealher last name, said she weighed 218 pounds when she joined OA. Shenow weighs 125, though she's lived in this capital of cookery fortwo years.   ``If you're fit emotionally and spiritually and every other way,you eat to enjoy it, not because you have to,'' said Kathy. ``NewOrleans is known for its food and its restaurants. I'm sure some ofour members will really enjoy it. Others will avoid it. We all haveto do what's right for us.''   Organizers said 1,500 people from all over the world registeredfor the convention and its nearly 40 meetings and workshops.   Overeaters Anonymous is divided into nine regions nationally,said Annette Mambuca, the group's publications editor. Theconventions are rotated among the regions.   When the southeastern region's turn came, New Orleans wasselected _ ``strictly on the convention facilities and the appealit would have for our members,'' Ms. Mambuca said.   OA isn't the first group finding itself in conflict with NewOrleans' rich food tradition. In March, 24,000 heart doctorsgathered for the American College of Cardiology's convention, andNew Orleans-style banquet menus had to be modified to reducecholesterol levels.   Overeaters Anonymous, which was started in January 1960 in LosAngeles, is patterned after the Alcoholics Anonymous program.   ``The program is not really a diet club,'' Sever said. ``Wedon't provide a food plan or anything like that for our members. Weoffer support, we share in some of their griefs and in their joy ofrecovery. Some people feel they need some type of regimentation. Inthat case we tell them to see a doctor or a dietitian.''   OA does not charge fees or dues. Most groups take up acollection at meetings to cover expenses. The organization doesn'tsolicit or accept outside contributions.   ``I'll never graduate from OA,'' Kathy said. ``Initially I wentto lose weight. I stick around because of the spiritual andemotional growth.''</TEXT></DOC>
