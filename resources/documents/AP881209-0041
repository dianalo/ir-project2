A similar-sized quake in the Los Angeles area, where buildingcodes are stringent, probably would kill no more than 1,000 people,said Tucker, who spent two years conducting research east of theArmenian quake's epicenter.   ``Earthquakes don't kill people. Buildings do,'' seismologistRoger Bilham of the University of Colorado at Boulder added during anews conference at the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting.   Wednesday's severe quake, centered in the Caucasus Mountainsregion near the Soviet-Turkish border, registered 6.9 on the Richterscale. Reports indicate tens of thousands of people died.   ``It's a tragedy for all the people of my country,'' said LevZonenshain, a Soviet Institute of Oceanology geologist attending thegeophysics convention.   Tucker said many Armenian village huts are adobe, while buildingsin cities often are unreinforced masonry or tilt-up, prefabricatedstructures made of concrete slabs that are simply hooked together.   Village homes have ``thick mud and rock ceilings for insulationin winter,'' and they kill when they collapse, Tucker said.   While urban Armenian construction practices have improvedsomewhat, ``they are still not up to California building codes,'' headded.   Zonenshain agreed that many urban Armenian buildings areunreinforced and said they are built ``from stony blocks of volcanicmaterial.''   Armenia lacks enough trees for widespread use of wood buildings,which better withstand quakes, said U.S. Geological Survey scientistBob Hamilton, president of the Geophysical Union's seismologysection.   ``A 6.9 earthquake that is shallow in the crust in that part ofthe world often does a lot of damage because of the nature of theconstruction,'' he said.   Soviet scientists were aware of the threat of major quakes in theregion between the Black and Caspian seas, but many of their studiessuggesting which areas are most vulnerable ``are not made known tothe authorities or judged by any councils'' of scientists, saidGeorge Purcaru of the Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics inFrankfurt, West Germany.   Zonenshain denied the allegation, saying, ``We have specialcouncils organized for (quake) prediction,'' and they have power totell authorities to improve construction practices.   Bilham said the Caucasus Mountains were created by the collisionof the Eurasian Plate of Earth's crust on the north and the ArabianPlate on the south. The quake occurred along the boundary of theEurasian Plate and a ``microplate'' crunched in between the twogiant plates, he said. The boundary also underlies parts of Iran andTurkey.   In 1667, a major quake killed an estimated 80,000 people in theCaucasus Mountains region, Bilham said.   That jolt's magnitude was between 7 and 7.5, and ``great'' quakesmeasuring about 8 on the Richter scale rock the region roughly every1,000 years, so ``6.9 is not a very big earthquake for thatregion,'' Purcaru said.   Zonenshain said the epicenter of Wednesday's quake was in an areaknown as a ``seismic gap,'' which had a lull in major quake activityfor about the last 50 years. Seismic gaps are where the lack ofquakes lets stress build up on faults, making the area more likelyto experience a big quake.   ``They may have been complacent in the last 50 years because theydidn't have big earthquakes'' in that period, said seismologistMansour Niazi, a native Iranian and seismologist at LawrenceBerkeley Laboratory.   Purcaru said the jolt probably was caused by ``thrust'' or``dip-slip'' motion, in which compression by the plates makes groundon one side of a fault move upward over ground on the other side.   Similar quakes included the 6.4-magnitude San Fernando quake inLos Angeles in 1971, which state officials say killed at least 58people, and last year's 5.9-magnitude Whittier Narrows quake, which,with its aftershocks, killed eight Southern Californians.</TEXT></DOC>
