Surrounded by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver,Peter MacNicol steals the movie as the villainous word-mangling artrestorer, Janosz Poha, in ``Ghostbusters II.''   Joe Pesci, as the troublesome but lovable Leo Getz, fits right inwith Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, the high-powered stars of ``LethalWeapon 2.''   But neither MacNicol or Pesci initially wanted the part.   Why would McNicol, an accomplished theater performer and featuredplayer in the acclaimed film ``Sophie's Choice,'' want to switchfrom Shakespeare to slime? After reading the script, he called hisagent and told him to forget it.   Pesci enjoyed the comic police thriller ``Lethal Weapon,'' butnever imagined adding himself to the sure-fire team of Gibson andGlover. When his agent advised him a funny part was available in thesequel, Pesci was skeptical. After all, he was better known forplaying tough guys in ``Raging Bull'' and ``Once Upon a Time inAmerica.''   But both actors reconsidered.   What impressed MacNicol about ``Ghostbusters II'' was the name,``Vigo of Carpathia,'' the evil spirit that haunts the film. Hismind quickly filled in details.   ``I thought, `What can I do with this Carpathia connection? Whydoes this art restorer know so much about this particular painting?Maybe there's some kinship of country involved there.' This is allin a matter of seconds. ... I called back the agent and said I'd goin,'' MacNicol said.   Pesci, tired of scripts that were blatant imitations of JoeyLaMotta (the boxer Jake's brother) in ``Raging Bull,'' took a likingto Getz and agreed to talk to producers Richard Donner and JoelSilver. Getz, in protective custody, is an accountant who haslaundered nearly half a billion dollars in drug money from theorganization that Gibson and Glover are trying to crack.   ``I explained that I saw him very frantic and a big pest and awhiner, wanting to be a cop and a hero himself, knowing all aboutpolice procedures. I acted out a couple of bits for the characterand they both started laughing. They said, `What are we wasting timefor? Let's get him in wardrobe, it's funny, let him do it.'''   Receiving the part was the first step for Pesci. He still wasn'tsure if he would hurt or help the team of Gibson and Glover.   ``I knew when I met Mel and Danny and hung with them a little bitif I could pull this off,'' Pesci said. ``Mel and Danny had theirown way of working; it's hard to break into something like that.   ``They don't know where you're coming from. They're afraid tojust say, `Go ahead and ruin our movie, c'mon in and ruin it.' Theywere going to be nice and also a little cautious. That was openingday, but it worked out well.''   Like Murray and Aykroyd, MacNicol had an extensive background inimprovisational theater. The Dallas native added his own touches tohis screen character, speaking broken English in a thick EasternEuropean accent.   ``When I did read for the part, I said, `Anything goes?' BecauseI had seen the guys out in the waiting room, they were young JohnCarradine types _ tall, quiet and menacing. This thing, thischaracter, came full blown like Athena out of my skull. Judging fromthe looks in their eyes, they were thinking, `We can use this guy _we got to use this guy.'''   Pesci also took liberties, drawing on an unusual source forGetz's flustered way of expressing himself.   ``If you go to Disneyland in California, all the employees areMormons from Utah, nice kids, great smiles,'' Pesci explained.``They handle people all day long. They never get angry.   ``You walk up to one and say, `Excuse me, we're looking all overthe place and can't find Fantasyland. They start saying, `OK, OK,Fantasyland. OK, OK. You're here, OK, OK.' I just added to it.''   MacNicol and Pesci each play characters far different fromthemselves. They wanted it that way.   ``That's the fun for me,'' MacNicol explained. ``It's like ahunt, looking for all the characteristics, making up this mosiac. Ithink I'm one of the youngest character actors.''   ``Yeah, that's the best,'' Pesci said. ``I've heard a millionactors say it. It's such a great thing to get out of yourself,somewhere else.   ``We all have a little bit of Leo Getz or Joey LaMotta. We allhave these kinds of people in us, that's where an actor gets itfrom. What you do is bring that part of you out more. As if you werethat type of a person.''   But the actors took differing views of a supporting player'sresponsibilities.   ``They don't have to do any of the awful chores,'' MacNicol said.``They don't have to heave that story along. They get to have themost fun.''   ``It is fun, but it's still a job,'' Pesci cautioned. ``The otherway to look at it is if the character fails, if the movie fails, Icould have gotten the heat for it. `Well, they brought this othercharacter in there and he was jerking around trying to be funny andhe wasn't funny.'''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thurs AMs July 20</NOTE></DOC>
