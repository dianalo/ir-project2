The commercial solid and chemical waste disposal concern said $418 million of the total for the year ending Sept. 30 will be used for corporate developments, including acquisitions, development of landfill sites, and start-up of municipal collection contracts. Most of the rest would be used to buy new equipment.    Browning-Ferris said $716 million was spent for capital expenditures in fiscal 1987, up from the $504 million it had budgeted.    A spokesman said the company will continue its acquisition pace in fiscal 1988. For fiscal 1987, Browning-Ferris said it acquired more than the 70 small waste companies it bought in fiscal 1986.    While Browning-Ferris doesn't make earnings projections, some analysts who follow the industry predict net income will increase 37% in fiscal 1988 to $235.1 million, or $1.50 a share, from fiscal 1987. Revenue is projected to increase to $2.1 billion from $1.7 billion in fiscal 1987. Browning-Ferris said it expects earnings this year to be boosted by a drop in its tax rate to 37% from 44%. </TEXT></DOC>
