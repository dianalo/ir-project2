Inc. announced today it would goprivate in a $1.23 billion leveraged buyout by Kohlberg KravisRoberts andamp; Co. The deal could thwart Dart Group Inc.'s attempt totake over the supermarket and department store chain.   The buyout agreement, signed after several days of negotiationsbetween Stop andamp; Shop directors and several interested firms, callsfor a Kohlberg Kravis subsidiary, SSC Holdings Corp., to purchaseall 28 million outstanding Stop andamp; Shop shares at $44 each, Stop andamp;Shop said in a statement.   Kohlberg Kravis is an investment company specializing inmanagement-led acquisitions, including the $6.2 billion leveragedbuyout of Beatrice Cos. in 1986. In a leveraged buyout, investorsborrow heavily to buy out a company and then pay off the debt withthe target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.   Stop andamp; Shop's board had rejected as inadequate Dart's offer of$37 a share, or a total of $1.03 billion.   Officials of Dart could not be reached for comment today, but aspokesman had said they would likely make a counter offer.   Other companies reportedly interested in Stop andamp; Shop were ThomasH. Lee Co. of Boston, and Riordan, Freeman andamp; Spogli Inc. of LosAngeles.   Stop andamp; Shop has 113 supermarkets and 169 Bradlees in 12 statesin the Northeast.   The company's stock has gone up more than $25 a share since Dartfirst announced its takeover intent in January. In early New YorkStock Exchange trading today, it was up another 75 cents to $43.37{a share.   The sale, which must be approved by a majority of Stop andamp; Shopshareholders, is expected to commence on or before March 4, Stop andamp;Shop said. Kohlberg Kravis has received a financing commitment fromManufacturers Hanover Trust Co., the retailer said.   Stop andamp; Shop said it will retain its present management andremain based in Braintree.   On Friday, Dart said it would launch a proxy fight and calledfor a special meeting of Stop andamp; Shop shareholders at which it wouldmove to replace the directors.   Dart, based in Landover, Md., is known for a series ofunsuccessful but profitable bids to gain control of othercompanies, and its chairman, Herbert Haft, and president, RobertHaft, have acquired reputations as corporate raiders.   Their most recent targets include Supermarkets General Corp. andDayton Hudson Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
