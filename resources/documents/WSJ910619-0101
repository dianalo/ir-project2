Even as great a skepticof politicians as Mr. Hamilton, however, might have beenshocked by what is happening in California now that votersthere created term limits to throw the rascals out. Theincumbents are so driven to keep their jobs that they havesued the people.   At issue is the Political Reform Act of 1990, enacted bythe voters in November as Proposition 140. Its mainprovisions limit statewide officeholders in the executivebranch and state senators to two four-year terms and membersof the state Assembly to three two-year terms. The votersalso cut the budget of the Legislature by nearly 40%, toabout $1 million for each legislator. A sign of thesignificance of these reforms is that opponents of termlimits, including many lobbyists who don't want to see theirinvestments thrown out of office, spent $10 million trying tostop Prop. 140, whose backers won spending $3 million.   The American rule that if you lose in politics, try thecourts even applies to legislators. The fate of a lawsuitfiled in the name of the California Legislature could signalthe future of other term limits, which have passed inOklahoma, Colorado and several cities.   The bad news is that the California Supreme Court lastweek granted Round One to the legislators. The state justicesissued a temporary ruling against the 40% budget cut, pendinga full review of the lawsuit as early as September. There wasno written opinion explaining their action, which protectedstaffers in two budget-control agencies that legislatorsannounced would be the first to go. This ruling leaves theterm limits in effect, but could signal problems with Prop.140.   This would be too bad, because only incumbents could lovethe legal arguments here. The legislators claim the votersmust be protected from their decision to limit terms becausethis deprived them -- meaning the voters -- of aconstitutional right. The supposed &quot;right&quot; is to berepresented indefinitely by the same legislator. Democracyand our republican form of government depend on the abilityof legislators to serve unlimited terms, the legislators say,so the voters failed to understand their own well-being bylimiting terms. Could it be this humility that convincedvoters that something had to be done?   In court papers, the legislators claim that theirconstitutional rights are also at stake. They claim there isa &quot;fundamental right to be a candidate for public office,&quot;which they say is among the &quot;associational rights&quot; in theFirst Amendment.   If the First Amendment applies, what about the rights ofexecutive-branch officials? Half the states limit the numberof terms governors can serve, and after the 22nd Amendment wealso limit the number of terms presidents can serve. In theirlegal papers, the best the legislators do to distinguishbetween the two branches is that &quot;patronage and militarypowers of an elected chief executive made long tenure in thatposition a threat to republican government.&quot; Legislators maynot be commanders in chief, but this hardly warrantspermanent tenure.   It's a sign of how out of touch the legislators havebecome that their legal papers reject out of hand theonce-familiar republican ideal of citizen-politicians. &quot;Thereis nothing to suggest that rapid turnover of persons notinterested in a career in public life will benefit thestate,&quot; they argue. This would surprise many people,including the Founders, who never imagined the country wouldbe run by career politicians.   In contrast, the legal papers defending Prop. 140 filed bythe Pacific Legal Foundation explain why term limits are thebest response now that individual challengers no longersucceed against entrenched incumbents. In last year'sCalifornia state elections, incumbents outspent challengersby an 8-to-1 margin, winning re-election in 92% of the races.   The movement for term limits for national office is aresponse to similar incumbent advantages in the U.S.Congress, where for years the re-election rate has been inthe 90%-plus range. Like congressmen, California legislatorshave free mailing privileges. They even recently spent morethan $2 million to buy television equipment that can helpincumbents produce election advertisements.   Along with their broader constitutional arguments, thelegislators say there are technical problems with Prop. 140.One argument is whether Prop. 140 revised the stateconstitution, which would require a constitutionalconvention, or merely amended the constitution as voters cando with propositions. Prop. 140 does not alter the powers ofthe Legislature, only how long legislators can serve. Sounlike an earlier proposition the courts invalidated becauseit tried to limit judicial power, Prop. 140 only amends therules of how the Legislature operates. It does not revise thepowers of this branch of government.   The legislators also object that although Prop. 140protects their vested pension rights, it will reduce theirfuture pensions. They claim this violates their contractualrights, noting that &quot;California law requires liberalconstruction of pension rights.&quot; Their argument assumes thatsomehow legislators have the power to contract for anunchangeable pension plan.   It's risky to predict how the California Supreme Courtwill rule in this case, but the people with the most at stakeseem to think most of Prop. 140 will be upheld. So far morethan a quarter of legislative staffers have acceptedgolden-handshake severance benefits. Assembly Speaker WillieBrown is thinking about running for mayor of San Francisco.   It's also true that current members of the CaliforniaSupreme Court should understand the virtues of new blood inhigh office. They are in their positions because the votersthrew out former Chief Justice Rose Bird and several of hercolleagues. The high rate of judicial turnover may helpexplain why judges were not included in the term limits.   It's unlikely that we will ever accomplish the originalideal of a broad range of citizens spending a few years inpublic office, then returning to private life. Still, thereis something telling about the legal argument the legislatorsmade here that &quot;the state can no longer be governed bygeneralists; each policy area demands considerableexpertise.&quot; The voters apparently have decided which theyprefer between a government that tries to do so much itrequires experts vs. a more limited government where alifetime commitment to politics is no longer a requirementfor public office.
