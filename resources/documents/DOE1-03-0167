As substrates convenient for taking the profiles, the authorsused oxygen-free BKDB-1000 silicon and GDS3-3 p-Ge compensated with gold.The electron concentration profile in the doped layers of silicon wasdetermined by measurement of the specific conductance of successivelyetched off layers at room temperature and comparison of it with the bulkcarrier concentration from the curves of Irvin. The measurements forGe were carried out at 77{sup 0}K where the substrate resistance wasquite high. The authors determined the electron concentration and themobility. Indium was used as the contact material.</TEXT></DOC>
