The Japanese currency lost ground on worries about losseson Tokyo's stock market, where the Nikkei index of 225 stocksdeclined more than 2%.</LP><TEXT>   Traders said a rumor during Tokyo trading that Japan'sYamaichi Securities Co. was in financial trouble also weighedon the Japanese currency. A Yamaichi spokesman and JapaneseFinance Ministry officials dismissed the rumor as false.   Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5775 marks,down from 1.5795 marks late Tuesday, and at 129.33 yen, upfrom 128.78 yen. Sterling fetched $1.8081, up from $1.8070.   Early Thursday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 129.10yen, down slightly from Tokyo's close Wednesday of 129.38yen, and at 1.5770 marks, down from 1.5908 marks atWednesday's close.   The dollar traded as high as 1.5950 marks in Asia andEurope on Wednesday in a continuation of this week'sshort-covering rally, said Peter Iversen, a trader at ShawmutBank in Boston. The currency eased later in North Americantrading.   Market-watchers said traders chose to sell a few dollarsat the close of dealing in anticipation of the release of theNovember U.S. retail sales report today.   Retail sales last month are expected to show no changefrom October, according to the consensus of 13 economistssurveyed on the report.   Traders said the dollar could benefit through Decemberfrom position-squaring. The market, which is short, or in anoversold position, on dollars, may take the U.S. unit up asit squares positions ahead of year-end book closings, theysaid. Squaring positions helps safeguard profits made duringthe year or limit losses. The dollar's intraday gains came inpart from such position-squaring, traders said.   In the thin pre-holiday market, traders &quot;definitely don'twant to be too short&quot; on dollars, Mr. Iversen said, as eventsheat up in the Soviet Union. By taking a short position, atrader is betting a currency will drop in value and can bebought back at lower levels.   Further news of turmoil in the Soviet Union added to thedollar's momentum, traders said.   Tass reports yesterday that Soviet President MikhailGorbachev met Tuesday with military leaders to discuss&quot;military structures&quot; in the foundering nation fueled doubtsabout who is in charge of the military forces, traders said,weighing on the mark. German banks hold the bulk of Sovietforeign debt, making the mark especially vulnerable to eventsin Moscow.   Although the dollar failed to test 1.60 marks, animportant psychological level, on its climb in Asia, Mr.Iversen said he expects the dollar to consolidate near thatlevel on year-end position-squaring.   Traders &quot;would be comfortable&quot; with a dollar at 1.60 marksby year's end, Mr. Iversen said. But he cautioned that, inthe thin dealings, a plunge to 1.55 marks is also apossibility, particularly if U.S. economic news remainsnegative.   Kevin Raphael, chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Bankin New York, said he believes the dollar is poised tocontinue downward.   &quot;The economy has leapfrogged to the top of the Bushagenda,&quot; and further bad news is likely to make the frontpages, he said, arguing that the dollar could fall as low as1.52 marks before staging a turnaround.   Even if today's retail sales figure proves &quot;surprisinglystrong,&quot; Mr. Raphael said, knee-jerk dollar buying wouldprobably be reversed quickly. The &quot;attitude is so ensconced&quot;that the economy is in bad shape that traders will want tosell on any rallies, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
