A human-resources executive is among the five highest-paidofficers at nine U.S. companies, concludes a review of 1991proxy statements by the newsletter Executive CompensationReports. One is William Wayland, who earned $616,750 in 1990as Textron's executive vice president, human resources.Another is Bruce Carswell, paid $672,000 as GTE's senior vicepresident, human resources and administration.   In addition, a handful of companies -- including GTE andEli Lilly -- have given their senior human-resourcesexecutive a seat on the board. Mr. Carswell left the GTEboard last March following a two-year tenure. AlthoughTextron's Mr. Wayland isn't a director, he does serve on theruling management committee.   Human-resources officials command more money andvisibility nowadays because many act as their chiefexecutive's strategist on touchy issues, such as executivecompensation and downsizing. &quot;There's more responsibility andthere's more expected&quot; of them, notes newsletter publisherJudith M. Fischer. Human-resources executives &quot;are movingfrom the back room to the board room,&quot; concurs Michael Losey,president of the Society for Human Resource Management.   Today's top human-resources officers at the nation'slargest businesses typically earn between $300,000 and$400,000, up from $200,000 five years ago, estimates MarcSchappell, a recruiter for Egon Zehnder International. &quot;Theprice for good HR talent is skyrocketing,&quot; and pay levels&quot;are going to keep growing,&quot; says James W. Peters, presidentof consulting firm Wargo.                                                                                                          Just Hope the Boss   Will Buy Your Video                                                                                                          ONE performance-evaluation tool for bosses takes anunusual tack: videotapes that dramatize an individual'sstrengths and weaknesses.   The market is flooded with hundreds of so-called &quot;upwardfeedback&quot; products, which typically gauge a manager's skillsby surveying subordinates, peers and superiors. NationalComputer Systems' &quot;Excellent Manager Program&quot; is unusual inits use of custom videotapes, training specialists say.   A computer analyzes survey results; then it assembles,from a repertoire of 23 vignettes, several professionallyperformed scenes that mostly address the executive'sweaknesses. In a scene portraying poor delegating, a femaleboss insists on taking over an aide's ill-preparedpresentation. The executive viewing the scene is supposed tosee his or her shortcomings in action.   National Computer, a Minneapolis maker of electronicscoring devices, started marketing its assessment programlast spring. The firm says it has evaluated 420 managers at62 companies, usually charging $340 per manager, and expectsto have handled 1,000 by early 1992.   But some customers question the videotape's benefits. &quot;Isee it as a gimmick,&quot; because National Computer's separatewritten analysis gives more detailed feedback, says RandyClark, quality and education manager at a Whirlpoolsubsidiary that so far has put 50 middle managers through theNational Computer program. Still, Mr. Clark concedes, thevideotape &quot;was one of the selling points for our management&quot;in buying the program.                                                                                                          Companies Form Teams   To Expedite Decisions                                                                                                          SOME BIG companies try to speed their decision making bycreating innovative senior management teams.   Two-thirds of such corporations now have top-level teams,up from 25% a decade ago, says David Nadler, president ofDelta Consulting Group, New York. But few operateautonomously or otherwise shake up the entrenched corporatehierarchy. Teams at American Telephone andamp; Telegraph, EastmanKodak and New York Life Insurance are exceptions, say Mr.Nadler and another consulting firm, United Research/Gemini.   Last July, ATandamp;T Chairman Robert Allen established aself-governing operating committee to serve as his chiefoperating officer. Mr. Allen isn't on the panel, and the fivemember executives will rotate its chairmanship every sixmonths. No other major company gives an operating committeethis much independence, Mr. Nadler believes.   Kodak's chemicals division replaced three senior vicepresidents with self-directed management teams last May. Oneteam focuses on manufacturing, another handles administrationand the third oversees research and development. Like theteams at ATandamp;T, none has a fixed leader. Decisions &quot;get madefaster because there are fewer layers,&quot; says EarnestDeavenport, the division's president.   New York Life took a different approach in revampingmanagement of its big individual-insurance business lastsummer. A new marketing team is run by the head of theservice operation, and the senior sales executive chairs anew service team. Turf battles have nearly vanished, says LeeGemmill, an executive vice president, because &quot;they're all inthe same sandbox together.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE HEADHUNTING downturn drags on. The number of searchesdropped 3% in the third quarter, and the current quarter&quot;looks dismal,&quot; the Association of Executive SearchConsultants says. . . . Average total compensation fordirectors of 100 major companies climbed an average of 4% to$47,479 this year from $45,650 in 1990, according to a studyof 1991 proxies by recruiters SpencerStuart.</TEXT></DOC>
