Frank Arnold Nesbitt, 44, was arrested at a hotel in suburbanWashington. He was charged with communication and delivery and theattempt to communicate and deliver unauthorized information toagents of the Soviet government, the FBI said in a brief statement.No other details were released.   But Nesbitt, in a lengthy interview with The Washington Postpublished in Sunday's editions, said he did not tell Soviet agentsanything useful and informed the FBI of his dealings with the KGBsoon after he left Moscow earlier this year. He said he wanted tobe a double agent for the U.S. government.   The Post said Nesbitt approached the paper Friday because he wasunhappy with the response he received from the FBI after he offeredhis services as a spy following a return from an 11-day stay inMoscow.   Nesbitt was being held in the Alexandria, Va., Adult DetentionCenter pending a preliminary hearing Monday.   He told the newspaper he left his family and a computer job inMemphis in June to go to Central America, where he wanted to buysmall parcels of land. The paper said Nesbitt's story could not beindependently verified.   That didn't work out, Nesbitt told the paper, so he went toGuatemala City and then Bolivia in August where he met a Sovietofficial traveling with a Russian ballet group.   The meeting, which Nesbitt said was ``purely happenstance,''ultimately led to Nesbitt's trip to Moscow, where he said the KGBtried to recruit him for espionage.   He said when he arrived in Moscow, he was paired with a KGBcolonel who identified himself only as Vladimir and kept in a``safe house'' about two miles from the Kremlin.   For most of his 11-day stay, Nesbitt told the paper, he andVladimir reviewed his experience in the U.S. military and defensecommunications. He said most of the information he provided to theSoviets was at least 25 years old.   He said he was initially paid $2,000. He said he gave the FBI$1,300 and showed the Post an FBI receipt for it.   Nesbitt said the Soviets asked him to funnel nuclear weaponssecrets out of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico,where he said he could have been helpful in locating what theSoviets implied was an agent already operating at the facility.   Nesbitt said he had a top secret clearance while serving as acommunications officer in the Air Force from 1963 to 1966 and inthe Marines from 1969 to 1979.   While working at Los Alamos during 1983 and 1984, Nesbitt saidhe held a non-classified post until right before he left, when hewas given a top security clearance. Nesbitt, who said he never hadaccess to government secrets, said he worked at Los Alamos lessthan a year and left after a personality conflict with a supervisor.   Nesbitt said he contacted U.S. authorities as soon as he arrivedback in Guatemala and FBI officials met his plane when he returnedto Washington Oct. 3.   Nesbitt said he had been detained by the FBI at a Washingtonhotel since Oct. 3. He said he left that hotel Friday and went toThe Post to tell his story. The hotel room where Nesbitt wasstaying Saturday when he was arrested was a room rented by a Postreporter for the interview, the newspaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
