Under the program, which takes effect Jan. 1, physicians withcritical skills now in short supply _ such as surgeons _ can boosttheir salaries by up to $20,000 a year if they agree to re-enlistfor four years.   Smaller ``retention bonuses'' will be paid to physicians whore-enlist for two or three years.   A surgeon who signs up for another four-year hitch under theprogram would see his total monetary compensation rise from roughly$92,250 a year to $112,250 a year.   ``The Department of Defense and the Congress believe we havespotted a problem here in time to do something about it,'' saysDavid Newhall, the No. 2 executive in the Pentagon's health affairsoffice. ``There are other severe non-salary problems that contributeto the loss of military physicians, but this is a key start.''   Congress authorized the new bonus program in the Pentagon'sfiscal 1989 budget authorization and earmarked $30 million for theeffort as long as the Defense Department meets certain requirements.   The most important was a report to Congress by Nov. 15 comparingmilitary and civilian salaries along with a plan for divvying up themoney among different types of physicians.   Another report focusing on military health professionals otherthan doctors is due by Dec. 1.   Newhall said the Pentagon met the Nov. 15 deadline for the firstreport and will meet the deadline for the second. The Pentagonofficial declined to release the first report, but a copy of the25-page document was obtained by The Associated Press from othersources.   The report concluded that the new bonus program authorized byCongress is desperately needed because the last major overhaul ofmilitary physician salaries occurred in 1980.   During the intervening years, it said, inflation has totaled 35percent and the net income of civilian doctors has climbed 47percent. In some specialties, such as heart surgery, the differencebetween military and civilian pay now exceeds 100 percent.   ``The result is a general loss of buying power for all militaryphysicians, and a significant loss of competitive compensation forcertain highly paid specialists,'' the report states.   The report said that while losses of experienced physicians werewidespread, the most critical shortages were among doctors withspecialty skills.   ``The lure of readily attainable, significantly higher pay is anattractive incentive for military physicians to leave the service atthe completion of their obligated service,'' the report said. ``In a12-month period commencing in 1987, the Navy lost 76 percent of itstrained specialists completing their initial training obligation.''   The Pentagon said it would use the money authorized by Congressto pay annual bonuses ranging from $20,000 down to $1,500 inexchange for re-enlistment contracts.   The various medical specialties have been divided into sevengroups for calculating the bonuses, based on where ``the DefenseDepartment is suffering the worst shortages,'' the report said.   The top group includes only two specialties: surgery andorthopedics. The second tier will include anesthesiology,ophthalmology, otolaryngology and urology. The third group coversradiology and obstetrics-gynecology.</TEXT></DOC>
