SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush's ethics panel agreed Wednesdaythat adding lesser penalties will increase enforcement ofconflict-of-interest laws, which now carry felony sentences.   ``This is much needed,'' said former Attorney General GriffinBell, vice chairman of the panel. ``It takes a harshness out of thelaw and makes the law much more effective. Now when you have a closecase, you just don't prosecute. You don't do anything.''   The panel's draft report predicted, ``By providing alternativeprosecutorial tools that can be more carefully tailored to theoffense, these sanctions may expand the number of enforcementactions.''   With a series of decisions at its fifth meeting Wednesday, theeight-member panel wrapped up all but the final drafting of a reportit hopes to give Bush late next week. Most of the recommendationsrequire approval by him and Congress.   The laws which prohibit federal officials from using their officefor personal gain and which limit lobbying by former officials nowcarry felony penalties of up to two years in prison and a $250,000fine.   The panel recommended that these and several other conflictstatutes be given misdemeanor penalties and civil fines as well asfelony sentences.   Misdemeanor penalties can range up to one year in prison and a$100,000 fine. They said the civil fines should be the larger ofeither a specific amount set by Congress or an amount equal to thefinancial gain the official reaped by violating the law.   Civil fines can be imposed on the basis of the preponderance ofthe evidence. Criminal convictions require meeting the tougherstandard of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The panel said willfulviolations should still be punished as felonies, but negligent orinadvertent violations should carry the lesser penalties.   R. James Woolsey, a lawyer and former undersecretary of the Navy,said scientific and technical people considering whether to work forgovernment have ``worried that any violation of these laws makesthem a felon. It's far more reasonable if a mistake does not lead toa felony.''   The panel sidestepped the hardest decisions about what had becomeits most divisive issue: moonlighting by judges, members ofCongress, top executive branch officials and top aides in all threebranches.   The members agreed there should be a uniform limit on the outsideincome earned by all top officials but called on Congress to set thelimit and to let the President exempt some activities, likescholarly writing.   Their compromise recommendation was that Congress limit outsideearned income to a fixed percentage of an official's salary. Amajority of the group favored a figure closer to the 15 percentwhich now governs the executive branch rather than the higheramounts allowed in Congress and the judiciary.   The judiciary has no limit; the House limit is 30 percent ofsalary; the Senate limit, 40 percent.   The commission also proposed that Congress allow the president toexempt income from categories of work that do not raise ethicalissues or interfere with the full performance of official duties.This idea emerged after the commission tried but failed to agree ona list of exemptions.   Former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler suggested listingteaching by judges, among others. But Bell, who wanted to exemptroyalties from books or inventions, objected to exempting teachingby judges.   ``When you get above 15 percent of salary for teaching, you'renot a fulltime government worker,'' Bell said. ``You're not in youroffice when you're teaching and you need to be there so other judgescan talk to you.''   Other recommendations approved Wednesday:   _That political appointees should have to publicly disclose theirhome mortgage loans and debts to relatives, assets worth more than$1 million and income over $250,000. Those debts are now exempt fromdisclosure. The highest asset disclosure category now is over$250,000 and for income is over $100,000.   _That a three-branch commission, modeled on the sentencingcommission recently upheld by the Supreme Court, try to standardizeethics forms between the branches and issue advisory opinions on howto fill them out.   _That a panel of private citizens be recruited to give thepresident non-public advice on questions involving the appearance ofa conflict of interest which go beyond formal interpretations of thelaws.   _That the law authorizing independent counsels to investigate topexecutive officials should apply to members of Congress as well _ ifthe law is retained, an issue on which the panel took no position.   _That Congress set up a joint ethics staff to give the House andSenate uniform advice on ethical questions.</TEXT></DOC>
