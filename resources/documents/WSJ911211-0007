Companies once provided tax counseling just for topexecutives. But broader stock-option plans and theirheadaches push the counseling perk downward.

Waste Managementoffers worksheets so thousands of employees can projectprofits -- and taxes -- when exercising stock options.Personnel counselors help run the numbers and resolvequestions.</LP><TEXT>   Some 56% of all employers give some tax counsel, up from38% in 1985, say consultants Sibson andamp; Co. But firms debatehow much help is wise. &quot;You don't want people coming back andsuing if you hand them bad advice,&quot; says Larry Wangler ofconsultants Towers Perrin. PepsiCo sends employees factualtax-data statements about stock-option holdings, &quot;but willnot get into advice.&quot; Procter andamp; Gamble staffers can selecttax and financial advice for $235 from a benefits menu.   KPMG Peat Marwick charges $5,000 for a basic, one-dayfinance and tax seminar for up to 30 employees.                                                                                                          DO CALL, WE'LL HELP. That is the IRS's pledge for the 1992filing season.   The General Accounting Office says just 40% of calls totoll-free IRS query lines get through; the IRS, countingcallers who try twice, claims it's 74%. In any case, theagency promises to try harder. It plans to have 8,820 phonelines, up 14% from last spring. More than half the 1,100 newlines will lead to recorded Tele-Tax tips, expected to handle33 million calls. Live assisters will field another 36.6million. In all, the IRS projects 8% more calls in 1992.   Another goal: reducing wrong answers, still given 15% ofthe time. Besides improving data bases for assisters, the IRSis training them to glean more details from callers beforereplying. More queries will go to specialists. &quot;We aren'tasking every assister to answer every question,&quot; says theIRS's Phil Brand. Some 1,000 more full-time positions areadded to trim high seasonal turnover among assisters.                                                                                                          EXEMPT HOSPITALS and colleges seek to head off more badnews.   At a meeting Monday with the IRS, nonprofit officialslearned of plans for more hospital and university audits,stricter financial-reporting standards for lobbying groups,and closer scrutiny of charitable fund-raising. Concern abouttougher IRS action mounts in light of new rulings taxingcollege football bowls on sponsor fees and threatening theexempt status of hospitals engaged in joint ventures withdoctors.   Goals vary. Bruce Hopkins, a lawyer for nonprofits whoattended the session, wants the IRS to more carefully enforcelimits on political activities by churches. Bonnie Brier,general counsel of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,worries about new caps on exempt financing. Donald Alexander,a former IRS commissioner who organized the meeting, says heseeks clearer rules and more IRS coordination with nonprofitson what's exempt, what's not.   But, Alexander adds: &quot;That doesn't mean collecting moretaxes.&quot;                                                                                                          A LOSS ON THE SALE of a main residence, not deductiblenow, could be used to offset a taxable gain on the futuresale of another principal home, under a bill by Rep. BillArcher (R., Texas).                                                                                                          LIFE INSURANCE wins a reprieve as a vehicle for donations.An IRS ruling had denied gift and other deductions to a NewYork woman who planned to transfer a policy to a charity asher beneficiary and pay the premiums. The IRS said that couldviolate New York law. Now private ruling 9147040 revokes theprior one, noting the state has clarified its law to allowthe transfer. But the woman has dropped her plan.                                                                                                          ELIMINATING duplication is a goal of New York's decisionto stop requiring banks and businesses to submit formsreporting bank interest, rent and royalty fees, andmiscellaneous payments to non-employees. The state now getsthe data from the IRS.                                                                                                          PROBLEMS LOOM in the IRS's automation plan, acongressional panel warns.   The House government operations committee blasts the IRSfor sloppy management and poor financial planning in pursuingan $8 billion modernization effort. A panel report details&quot;major deficiencies&quot; in a July IRS award of a $1.4 billioncomputer contract, now under review. The report also faultsthe IRS for rushing plans to process taxpayer returns afterimaging them electronically, saying some of the technologyisn't yet dependable enough.   &quot;We wholeheartedly agree,&quot; IRS information chief HankPhilcox says. He cites stricter procurement rules andwelcomes the prospect of more congressional oversight. Still,he says the IRS intends to test image processing so it can&quot;take advantage when it's here&quot; and cut the error-proneretyping of returns. The report urges more electronic filing,which it sees as a more cost-effective and reliable methodfor receiving return data.   In a pilot project, some Ohio residents in 1992 will filetheir Form 1040EZ data using touch-tone phones.
