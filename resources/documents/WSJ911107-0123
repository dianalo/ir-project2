Mr. Wells's report makes it clearthat little has changed since I was in Saudi Arabia andKuwait in February-March and May-June as a volunteer adviserat the request of the Saudi government's National Commissionon Wildlife Conservation and Development.   As an American, the dismaying aspect to me of the Gulf Waroil spills and oil-well fires has been our choosing to ignorethese twin regional environmental tragedies. Our response tothe political emergency Iraq created was to take the lead informing the Desert Shield coalition and to send a halfmilliontroops. A consequence of the war has been two health andenvironmental emergencies, yet our response has beennegligible. We have left the problems to the Saudis andKuwaitis, who did not cause them and who are incapable ofcoping with them expeditiously, whatever our impression oftheir wealth. Consequently, the terrible effects of the oilfires and spills continue to be suffered by humans andwildlife, in both the immediate region and, to some extent,countries a few thousand miles from the war zone.</LP><TEXT>   The aftermath of the Gulf War deserved a much greater U.S.and international effort.
