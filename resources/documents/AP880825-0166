Paul Simon and SouthAfrican Foreign Minister Pik Botha met Thursday and said they wereable to debate apartheid without yelling at each other.   ``You name the controversial agenda ... we talked about it,''said Simon, D-Ill., who favors U.S. economic sanctions againstSouth Africa. ``We had a good, frank discussion.''   Simon, who unsuccessfully ran for president this year, is on afive-day fact-finding tour of South Africa.   Simon is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommitteeon African Affairs and will play a major role in deliberations onpending legislation to intensify U.S. sanctions against SouthAfrica. Limited sanctions have been in effect since 1986.   ``We never yelled at each other,'' Botha said after the100-minute meeting in a Johannesburg suburb. ``The senator has putall the difficult questions. But he has given me the opportunity toput my side. That's all I can ask.''   Botha and other South African leaders say they are pursuinggradual race reforms at their own pace and will not be pressured bysanctions. They also say black South Africans stand to suffer themost from any hardships caused by sanctions or foreigndisinvestment.   Simon later flew to Cape Town, where he conferred with twoleaders of the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party, includingHelen Suzman, the longest-serving member of Parliament. Mrs. Suzmanopposes sanctions.   On Friday, Simon plans to visit Crossroads, a black shantytownnear Cape Town. His visit will coincide with one by President P.W.Botha, who will be making his first official trip to Crossroads.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.   A pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, editorialized Thursdaythat Simon ``came here determined to find justification forsanctions.''   ``But then Americans do tend to have a simplistic _ should wesay a Simple Simon _ approach to other countries, and South Africais probably the worst example of this American madness to recreatecountries in their own image,'' the newspaper said.   Earlier in his trip, Simon visited several black townships andmet with black leaders such as Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.   The senator's request to meet with imprisoned African NationalCongress leader Nelson Mandela was rejected by the government. The70-year-old Mandela, South Africa's best known black leader, is inCape Town's Tygerberg Hospital being treated for tuberculosis.</TEXT></DOC>
