The essential results are described below. (1) The platinumgroup elements, which are contained in spent fuel, are quantitativelylimited, compared with total demand for them in Japan. And estimatedseparation and recovery cost is rather high. In spite of that, developmentof these techniques is considered to be very important because the supplyof these elements is almost from foreign resources in Japan. (2) Forrecovery of these elements, studies of recovery from undisolved residueand from high level liquid waste (HLLW) also seem to be required. (3)As separation and recovery methods, following techniques are consideredto be effective; lead extraction, liquid metal extraction, solvent extraction,ion-exchange, adsorption, precipitation, distillation, electrolysis ortheir combination. (4) But each of these methods has both advantagesand disadvantages. So development of such processes largely depends onfuture works. (author) 94 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
