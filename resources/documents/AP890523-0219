The confidentiality agreement, which provides would-be suitorswith sensitive data in exchange for a pledge not to accumulatestock or talk with labor, was too restrictive, Pan Am ChairmanThomas G. Plaskett said Monday in a letter delivered to the NWAboard.   A Pan Am spokesperson said Plaskett believes that, as acompetitor, his airline already has sufficient knowledge ofNorthwest's operation and financial condition to make a judgmentabout a possible offer. Industry experts estimate that it will takeapproximately $3.5 billion to acquire Northwest.   Pan Am remains free to meet with Northwest Airlines' unions _whose cooperation is considered key to any successful bid _ andretains the option to pursue a hostile tender, in which it wouldoffer to buy all outstanding shares of NWA's stock.   Pan Am says it will continue to cooperate with NWA's biddingprocedure, which sets a May 30 deadline for offers to buy thecompany.   ``We fully intend to adhere to their timetable,'' Pan Amspokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said.   She also said Plaskett does not intend to meet with Northwest'sunions ``unless he has the approval and permission of Northwest.''   Meanwhile, Plaskett embarked on a cross-country trip Mondaynight to round up potential investors for Pan Am's bid to acquireNorthwest.   Plaskett's attempt to acquire Northwest is considered a longshot, but having the support of labor or an agreement that wouldminimize merger disruptions would make it easier for Pan Am toobtain financial commitments from lenders.   At least one other potential bidder, a group led by Los Angelesinvestor Al Checchi, has indicated a desire to speak to thecompany's unions. Checchi's group, however, has signed theconfidentiality agreement that prohibits it from making suchcontact.   On Wall Street, Northwest's stock jumped $1.75 a share to$103.87{ Monday amid a growing sense that bids for the companywould be in the $110 to $115 range. Pan Am's stock dropped 12{cents to $4.37{.   Pan Am executives and Prudential-Bache Securities, the company'sfinancial adviser, will be in the Twin Cities on Wednesday to tryto interest investment and money management firms in the interimfinancing needed to swing a purchase.   Mike Hamilton, an analyst with Piper Jaffray andamp; Hopwood inMinneapolis, attributed the rise in NWA stock to the distributionof the offering circular for Pan Am's interim financing to theinvestment community, and to ``some speculation that Pan Am may bemoving towards a hostile tender.''   But Hamilton said that if Pan Am does decide to make a bid, itschances are slim whether it is friendly or hostile. Analysts havepointed out that while a combination of Pan Am and Northwest wouldcreate a megacarrier with few overlapping routes, Pan Am'sfinancial troubles make it an unattractive suitor.   Pan Am said last week that its principal backers, PrudentialBache and the Airlie Group, are willing to invest at least $400million.</TEXT></DOC>
