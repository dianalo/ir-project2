Maybe thisis the time for people to make a year-round type pledge of support to theseagencies.&quot;;   &quot;We expect it to worsen,&quot; he said. &quot;People manage to pull ittogether during the holidays, but afterwards they can't keep going.&quot;;   Infact, Santa Clara County's helping agencies -- the shelters and food pantriesand soup kitchens -- are doing just about the only land-office business intown this winter. While industry cuts loose thousands of workers and retailbusiness is painfully slow, the demand has never been greater at the SalvationArmy.;   &quot;We are helping three times as many people now as we were in January.Emergency food, rental assistance, clothing -- those (needs) all havetripled,&quot; said Capt. Kenneth Osbourn of the army's San Jose corps. &quot;People aretelling us that last year they had a job and this year they don't.&quot;;   Osbournwarned that the emergency is not over. Many agency professionals predictunemployment and poverty will worsen.;   Among them is Judy Nusbaum, of theEmergency Housing Consortium. At the agency's winter armory shelters in SanJose, Gilroy and Sunnyvale, there has been no holiday shortage of food orhelp. However, said Nusbaum, &quot;people are more generous at Thanksgiving andChristmas, but we have needs all year round.&quot;;   Also bracing for the worst isSteve Mangold, development coordinator at the Second Harvest Food Bank ofSanta Clara and San Mateo Counties. There, demand is at an all-time high.Volunteers have jumped in this week to fill the emergency need for workers,Mangold said. But that's nothing new.;   &quot;During the holidays, we pretty muchhave as many workers as we can handle, but we need more people throughout theyear,&quot; he said. &quot;But this is the time we need to do the outreach to thecommunity, because people are in the mood.&quot;;   The food bank gathers largecontributions of food and dispenses them to food pantries, soup kitchens andother meal programs as well as handing out groceries to hungry people.;   Inits two counties, the food bank figures it helped more than 150,000 people inNovember -- 45 percent over November 1990. At the same time, donations haveincreased only 14.7 percent.;   &quot;If we stay at this level, that means therecession is real deep and it is hitting a lot of people,&quot; Mangold said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARILYN LEWIS, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911222  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  553  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 22, 199100357091,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
