The Export Enhancement Program is the hottest program atpresent, and is being used in a virtual head-to-head confrontationwith the European Economic Community over trade policy.   ``U.S. exporters operate in a competitive trade environmentinfluenced by other exporters' subsidies and importers' barriers,''says analyst Mark Smith of the department's Economic ResearchService.   For example, the EEC operates a system of export subsidies whichenables high-priced wheat from the 12-nation trading bloc to besold on world markets at competitive prices, he said. Since 1978,the EEC has joined the traditional big four _ Argentina, Australia,Canada and the United States _ as a wheat exporter.   It was the use of export subsidies, to reduce high internalprices, that enabled the EEC to change from a net importer of wheatto a net exporter.   The United States had used some kinds of export subsidies in thepast, but it was the advent of the Export Enhancement Program, orEEP, in 1985 that caught the attention of world traders.   Under the program, U.S. exporters are given bonuses, orsubsidies, of government-owned commodities to compensate forreduced prices paid by a foreign buyer. The USDA does this only forthe sale of certain commodities to designated countries.   As of April 28, exporters had sold more than $4.81 billion worthof commodities to foreign buyers. That is the amount paid by theoverseas customers.   The exporters then collected bonuses of surplus commoditiesowned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. Those bonuses, orsubsidies, had a CCC book value of $2.86 billion _ the amount theCCC had paid for them under its domestic price support operations.   But the actual market value of the bonus commodities was lessthan $2.05 billion, reflecting their estimated worth on the U.S.domestic market at the time.   Thus, according to the figures supplied by the department'sForeign Agricultural Service, the commodities sold by exporters for$4.81 billion would have cost the foreign buyers at least $6.86billion if it had not been for the $2.05 billion in the marketvalue of the bonuses.   In other words, the bonuses reduced the purchase prices of theEEP commodities by about 30 percent.   Since the program began three years ago, more than 40 millionmetric tons of U.S. wheat have been sold at subsidized prices, theagency said. Although wheat is by far the largest EEP commodity,other items include barley, sorghum, rice, poultry feed, vegetableoil, frozen poultry, live dairy cattle, and eggs.   In his report, Smith said the chief markets for wheat under EEPhave been the Soviet Union, China, Morocco, Algeria and Egypt.Saudi Arabia has been the main barley purchaser.   Smith's analysis in the May issue of Agricultural Outlookmagazine refers to other export programs as well as EEP. Thoseinclude programs for short-term export credit financing; TargetedExport Assistance, or TEA, in which producer groups are helped tocarry out overseas promotional activities; and Food for Peace, orP.L. 480 assistance for needy countries.   Although the impact of TEA is difficult to measure, Smith saidthe other programs account for ``a significant share'' of U.S.commodity exports. In the case of wheat, for example, 60 percent to70 percent of the exports in the 1986-87 fiscal year that endedSept. 30 were covered by USDA programs.   ``Four of the top five markets for U.S. wheat in 1987 were chiefmarkets for wheat under the EEP, CCC credit guarantees, or foodaid,'' he said. ``Japan, the top market in value terms for U.S.wheat, was the exception, purchasing its wheat outside U.S. exportprograms.''   But the Soviet Union, the second-largest buyer, used the EEPprogram extensively. Egypt and Algeria, which were third and fifthlast year, bought U.S. wheat under a combination of EEP and theexport credit program. South Korea, which was the fourth-largestmarket, also bought significant amounts through credit arrangements.   Smith said that more than half of the 1987 exports of vegetableoils involved U.S. programs, primarily credit and food aid. Ricealso benefited, including credit sales to Iraq, and food aidshipments to the Dominican Republic and Sierra Leone.   The United States holds about 60 percent of the world feed graintrade, up from a low of 45 percent two years ago, he said. Mostexport sales are without the use of U.S. export programs. Cotton isanother major commodity that is not involved in the programs in amajor way.</TEXT></DOC>
