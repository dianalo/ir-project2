On Thursday, Sleight and his colleagues reported that giving anaspirin and a clot-dissolving drug within 24 hours of the onset ofa heart attack can reduce the death rate over the following fiveweeks from 13 percent to 8 percent.   This should now be considered standard treatment, the doctorssaid. But ``at the moment, most patients in the United States don'thave blood-clot dissolving treatment of any type,'' said RichardPeto, one of the researchers.   ``I've never seen a trial that produced results as striking asthese ones,'' he said.   Peto said the treatment could save the lives of 25,000 of the500,000 Americans who have heart attacks each year if they allreceived it.   It costs about $150 and can be done at any community hospital oreven by a doctor outside a hospital, the researchers said.   Peto and other study participants spoke at a press conferenceheld in London and New York in conjunction with publication of thelatest findings in the forthcoming issue of The Lancet, a Britishmedical journal. The results were widely publicized in March at ameeting of the American College of Cardiology in Atlanta.   The researchers studied 17,187 patients at 417 hospitals aroundthe world. Some patients were given aspirin, and some theclot-dissolving drug streptokinase. Another group was given both,and a control group was given neither.   The death rate up to five weeks after a heart attack was 13percent in the untreated control group. It dropped to about 10{percent in the patients given either aspirin or streptokinase, andit dropped to 8 percent in patients given both drugs, Peto said.   Furthermore, the study showed that the drugs reduced deaths inelderly patients, who were previously not thought suitable forclot-dissolving treatment because doctors thought it might increasetheir risk of strokes, Peto said.   It also showed that the drugs were helpful even if given as lateas 24 hours after the onset of chest pains, Peto said.   Streptokinase is derived from streptococcus bacteria, whichcause strep throat. Most heart attacks are caused by a clotblocking the coronary arteries, which provide a nourishing bloodsupply to the heart muscle.   Streptokinase dissolves the clots and aspirin helps to preventthe clotting of blood cells called platelets, thus helping toprevent reformation of clots, the researchers said.   The researchers found no increase in the rate of strokesfollowing the treatment. Streptokinase caused potentially hazardouslow blood pressure in 8 out of 100 patients, but ``this can beeasily dealt with provided doctors and nurses are aware that it canoccur,'' said Dr. Rory Collins, another study participant.   The study, called the second International Study of InfarctSurvival, or ISIS, will be followed by a third ISIS study intendedto compare the effectiveness of streptokinase with otherclot-dissolving drugs.   The most widely publicized of the alternative drugs is tissueplasminogen activator, or TPA, which is produced by geneticengineering and costs some $2,000 per treatment, compared to the$150 cost of streptokinase.   Current data does not allow a direct comparison of theeffectiveness of the two drugs, the researchers said.   Peter Drake, a biochemist and securities analyst with VectorSecurities International in Deerfield, Ill., said that the dramaticsuccess of streptokinase would likely force down the price of TPA.</TEXT></DOC>
