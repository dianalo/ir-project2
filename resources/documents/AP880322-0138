Gary Hovatter, public relations director forthe U.S. military in Honduras. ``We have not received any directiveas to when to begin redeployment.''   He said training exercises between Honduran and Americansoldiers would continue today at four sites, but few details wereavailable.   Hovatter also said five or six of the 10 soldiers injured in ahelicopter crash during an exercise could be released to light duty.   On Monday, he said they ``are in some pain and discomfort, butthey are handling it very well.''   Hovatter said the helicopter, a UH-1 Huey, was flying fromsouthern San Lorenzo to eastern Jamastran when it hit bad weatherand was forced to divert to Juticalpa, 35 miles north of theNicaraguan border. It crashed about six miles south of Juticalpa ina pine-covered valley, he said.   Nicaragua announced Monday its troops had withdrawn from theborder, and the Honduran military reported Sandinista soldiers hadretreated. Nicaragua's Sandinista government and Contra leadersalso agreed to a cease-fire during three days of peace talks whichwill end Wednesday at Sapoa on Nicaragua's southern border withCosta Rica.   Today, the Sandinista government proposed a 30-day cease-fireand amnesty for rebels. The Contras proposed a 45-day truce duringwhich rebels would move into cease-fire zones.   Col. Manuel Suarez Benevides, the Honduran armed forcesspokesman, said Monday the 3,200 U.S. troops that rushed toHonduras after a reported incursion by 2,000 Sandinista troopswon't be needed much longer.   ``It'll be a very short time. We're talking days only,'' he saidin an interview.   Also today, a U.N. fact-finding team requested by Nicaragua wasto leave for that country to investigate the border violence, theUnited Nations announced in a statement. It said observations willbe limited to the Nicaragua side, since no permission was receivedfrom Honduras to go there.   Meanwhile, Nicaraguan and Contra officials were optimistic afterthe first round of truce talks held in Nicaragua on Monday. Thetalks resume today.   ``The worst (fighting) is over and there is peace now in theborder region,'' Col. Reynald Andino Flores, commander of theHonduran army's 101st Infantry Brigade, said Monday by telephonefrom his headquarters in southern Honduras. ``We are remaining on astate of alert to be ready for anything that may happen,'' headded, and soldiers are ``constantly patrolling the area.''   Flores and other officers, some of whom insisted on anonymityfor security reasons, said on Monday the Sandinistas penetrated anarea of about 20 square miles inside Olancho province while chasingthe U.S.-supported Contra rebels in a two-week offensive to evictthe Contras from Nicaragua.   About 200 border incidents have been reported in Olancho sincethe Contras began fighting the leftist Sandinista government in1981.   President Daniel Ortega and the Nicaraguan government havedenied Sandinista soldiers crossed the border.   The Contras maintain camps in an area called Bocay, whichincludes territory on both sides of the border. Nicaragua claimsthe camps, which the Contras use to store supplies and to stageraids inside Nicaragua, are in Nicaraguan land, but the rebels saythey are in Honduras.   The Sandinistas and the Contras agreed to a three-day truce onMonday, the first of three days of their latest round of peacetalks.   At Sapoa, Nicaragua, a town on the Costa Rican border,representatives of the Sandinista government and Contras begantheir first direct talks on Nicaraguan soil. The purpose is to workout a cease-fire as required by the peace plan that five CentralAmerican presidents signed last Aug. 7.   After Monday's closed session, Gen. Humberto Ortega, Nicaragua'sdefense minister, said: ``The importance of today was that welistened for the first time at the highest level their (Contras')proposal,'' he told journalists.   Alfredo Cesar, one of the rebel negotiators, said the Contraplan calls for a 30-day truce, political amnesty and continuedtalks to work out a lasting cease-fire. ``Neither side seeks amilitary victory over the other,'' Cesar said. He called the firstround a ``step ahead.''</TEXT></DOC>
