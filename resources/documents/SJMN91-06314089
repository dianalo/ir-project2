Driven to Taiwan after losing acivil war to communist forces in mainland China, the Nationalists had fordecades viewed the island as a temporary haven, and allowed its infrastructureto deteriorate.;   Residents of Taipei, the capital city of 2.7 millionpeople, endure eye-stinging air pollution and snarled traffic. Construction ona subway line, promised for decades, began two years ago.;   The $300 billiondevelopment, to be spread out over six years, will involve nearly 800projects, including mass transit systems in five major cities, a newnorth-south highway, a high-speed train system, nuclear power plants, newsewage systems, museums and an amusement park to rival Disney World.;   About$60 billion worth of the projects are open to bidding by foreign firms, andU.S. businesses are hoping for a major chunk.;   The project will probablywiden the economic gap between Taiwan and the mainland. Officials saidTaiwan's per capita income would reach $14,000 in 1996 upon completion of thedevelopment plan, up from $8,000 in 1990.;   China's per capita income isexpected to be slightly more than $1,000 by then.;   Winning support at homeis not the project's only goal. The Nationalist government hopes that openingthe bidding on many of the contracts to foreign firms will help alleviate thecountry's increasing diplomatic isolation. Since Taiwan lost its seat in theUnited Nations to mainland China in 1972, the number of countries recognizingTaiwan has dwindled to 29.;   &quot;International participation in the projectswill help Taiwan gain much more than technology,&quot; said Shiao Chyuan-jeng, adirector of the private Institute for National Policy Research.;   Germany,Italy, Australia and Britain, which have maintained lukewarm relations withTaiwan since the 1970s for fear of protests from Beijing, have sentministerial-level officials to Taiwan to lobby for access to the projects.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Taipei, Taiwan  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911109  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  383  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, November 9, 199100314089,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
