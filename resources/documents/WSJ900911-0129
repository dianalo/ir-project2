Gigot's Aug. 17 &quot;PotomacWatch&quot; column, which takes exception to my alleged positionon the current crisis in the Persian Gulf. The thrust of thispiece is that I am somehow leading the pack of post-Cold Warright-wing conservatives urging a return to traditional U.S.isolationism.   Most journalists -- even those who appear only on theeditorial page -- usually give a public figure the benefit ofa quote before going on to critique or characterize his pointof view. However, Mr. Gigot has failed to extend even thisminimal journalistic courtesy, so it is impossible for me toknow what has led him to this incorrect conclusion.</LP><TEXT>   Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, I have made numerouspublic comments. By any objective standard, a reading of thetranscripts of those interviews demonstrates that I haveconsistently emphasized:   -- One, that the U.S. has a vital interest in this region.   -- Two, that the U.S. had no alternative to responding tothe local nations' appeal for U.S. military assistance todeter further Iraqi aggression.   -- Three, that the task of deterring Iraq from furtheraggression and seeking the removal of its armed forces fromKuwait is best handled by a multilateral response --diplomatically, economically and militarily.   In this crisis, there are obviously dangers that we shouldseek to minimize or avoid. For example, I have stressed thata protracted U.S. large-scale ground presence in Saudi Arabiawould be difficult for the U.S. to sustain and over timewould cause severe problems for the Saudi government, bothwithin its own country and within the Arab world.Consequently, I have urged that we follow a reinforcingstrategy, in which we emphasize air power, and that ourground forces complement and support those deployed byindigenous Arab governments, particularly Saudi Arabia andEgypt. Should Iraq invade Saudi Arabia or use chemicalweapons, I have said that the U.S. should retaliate in amassive way, with no sanctuaries for Iraq in its ownhomeland.   If Mr. Gigot believes these views constitute an&quot;isolationist&quot; position, then he is using a definition thatWebster's does not recognize.   Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.)   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
