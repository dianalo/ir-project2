A narrowingof the bronchiole and abnormal pooling of contrast medium in the destroyedair space are the prime findings. Since the object of radiography isextremely thin, direct magnification radiography is mandatory to obtainradiologic details. However, the problem with this technique is thatradiographic quality varies depending upon the size of the patient andthe concentration of contrast medium to be introduced in the lung. Thisstudy had two goals. One was to improve the image quality of SAB by FujiComputed Radiography (FCR). FCR provides radiographs with a good contrastand stable density throughout a wide range of exposure factors whichoccur in the use of SAB. The other goal was to separately evaluate morphologicalabnormalities in the outer and inner zones of the lung using X-ray CT.This idea was derived from our observations in positron emission tomographyusing {sup 13}N which revealed air trapped in the outer layer of thelung in diffuse panbronchiolitis. Fourteen patients underwent SAB, includingtwo cases of bronchiectasis, one of cancer, one of silicosis, one ofpost-inflammatory scar, four of diffuse panbronchiolitis and five ofchronic pulmonary emphysema. Of these fourteen cases ten and twelve casesreceived FCR and CT examinations, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
