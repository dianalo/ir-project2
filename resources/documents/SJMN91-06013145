Some critics question its reliabilityand assail it as a ploy to justify what they see as the administration'sgo-slow policy on global warming.;    They say that even if the findings arereliable, enough of the gases are already in the atmosphere to requirestronger action.;    Scientists say, further, that a substantial reduction inemissions will be required if the global concentration of the gases is to bestabilized at current levels.;    But William Reilly, the EPA administrator,said in an interview that the study showed that the United States had alreadyacted to stabilize its overall contribution to warming.;    Reilly has longadvocated emissions targets, provided they encompass all the implicated gases,not just carbon dioxide.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  WILLIAM K.
