Stevens and Thomas F. O'BoyleStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   A profit-taking rally lifted the dollar in foreign exchange trading, but only after the U.S. currency plunged to new lows earlier in the day.    Traders contended that the dollar's rebound was only temporary, however, and that a resumption of its decline is all but certain.    The dollar's initial drop to record lows yesterday also put upward pressure on the West German mark within the European Monetary System. That prompted central bank intervention in Europe to support some of the weaker currencies in that eight-nation system of managed exchange rates.    Early in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at a record low of 1.7001 marks, well under the previous low of 1.7062 reached Jan. 3, 1980. The dollar also hit an intraday low of 136.06 Japanese yen, another in a series of 40-year lows against the yen in recent days.    The dollar's early drop continued the currency's downward trend of the past several weeks. The move has been fueled by speculation among currency traders that major industrial nations have modified or abandoned their policy of supporting the U.S. currency.    In addition, the major central banks that intervened to slow the dollar's decline last week and Monday were believed to have stayed out of the market yesterday. That further encouraged bearish sentiment on the dollar.    Facing uncharted territory in exchange rates, however, traders said market participants chose to take profits yesterday by buying back dollars they had sold earlier at higher levels.    &quot;There was a pretty good rush for dollars because there were so many people (who had sold dollars earlier),&quot; Andrea Ligammari, a yen trader at Royal Bank of Canada's New York branch, said.    The dollar got a boost later in the day as the Dutch central bank cut its discount rate by one-quarter of a point to 4.25%. Although traders seldom take much note of Dutch rates, the fact that the West German and Dutch central banks closely coordinate their monetary policies led to expectations of a similar rate cut by the West German Bundesbank. That central bank's governing council will hold its regular meeting tomorrow in Frankfurt.    Yesterday, however, the West German central bank passed up an opportunity to lower short-term interest rates amid suggestions that it is waiting for the U.S. to move. Lower West German rates could help the dollar, but a unilateral cut might conflict with Bonn's domestic economic policy goals.    The Bundesbank yesterday canceled an expected offering of repurchase agreements, at which it had been speculated the central bank would set lower interest rates. Bundesbank Director Claus Koehler said in an interview: &quot;The market has quite enough liquidity. It was not necessary to add more to the system.&quot; He said the central bank's decision to cancel the offering was based on technical factors.    Still, market speculation was that the Bundesbank was acting to delay a cut in rates until it could be coordinated with a similar move by the U.S. Federal Reserve. West German market sources maintain that the Bundesbank favors reducing rates, however, particularly if the dollar falls below 1.70 marks.    Mr. Koehler said he &quot;fully agrees&quot; with the need for lower rates. But he said that if the Bundesbank were to cut rates independently, the current interest-rate differential between the U.S. and West Germany would be lost. He said he considers the current differential of 3.6 percentage points between West German rates and the higher U.S. rates &quot;appropriate&quot; in view of trade flows and currency values.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.7165 marks, compared with 1.7108 late Monday. It also rebounded to 137.51 yen from 136.95. The Tokyo market was closed for a holiday yesterday.    The dollar was quoted at 137.07 yen in early Wednesday trading in Tokyo. The Bank of Japan was reported to be buying the U.S. currency as that market reopened.    Yesterday's dollar rebound didn't alter the widespread negative market sentiment on the U.S. currency.    &quot;It's a correction that's long overdue, and we may not have seen the full extent of it,&quot; John Lynam, vice president, foreign exchange, for Security Pacific National Bank in New York, said. He said that &quot;nothing has changed fundamentally&quot; for the dollar and predicted that it will &quot;definitely&quot; fall to 1.70 marks and 135 yen.    &quot;And there's no reason to think that it will stop there,&quot; he said.    According to traders, the huge U.S. trade and budget deficits continue to drag down the dollar as they have done throughout its 2 1/2-year decline.    The currency's renewed plunge in recent weeks, however, is linked to evidence that the U.S., West Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy and Canada have abandoned efforts to support the dollar at the levels it has held since the nations agreed in February to keep it stable, through market intervention if necessary.    &quot;The currency is being depreciated. The central banks have gotten together and agreed that the dollar must go lower,&quot; Mr. Lynam said.    A side effect of the dollar's recent weakness is an increase in strains within the European Monetary System. Heavy dollar-selling puts strong upward pressure on the mark, the favorite alternative to the dollar among EMS currencies.    The mark advanced to a record high of 3.4090 French francs at yesterday's Paris foreign exchange fixing from the old record of 3.3995 set at the previous fixing Friday. Monday was a holiday in France.    The French central bank didn't intervene yesterday, and traders speculated that its absence is part of a new strategy of allowing wider fluctuation in the mark-franc rate.    The Italian and Belgian central banks intervened in other European trading to support their nations' currencies against the rising mark.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.70 an ounce to $468.40 in heavy trading. Estimated volume was six million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $468.20 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Tuesday, Nov. 3, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.

Analysts said the main reason was currency-marketintervention by the Bank of England to hold the pound's valuedown against the West German mark.   Britain's reserves of gold and foreign currencies rose anunderlying $6.7 billion in October from September, accordingto the U.K. Treasury, after rising $380 million in September.In October 1986, the reserves declined $668 million.   The British pound rose on the news to an intraday high of$1.7505, then eased. U.K. government bonds, or gilts, rose asmuch as 1/2 point as the reserves figures boosted pressuresfor a cut in interest rates.   Analysts said the rise in reserves came mostly fromintervention in foreign exchange markets. The Bank of Englandhas frequently sold pounds and bought marks to try to keepthe pound from rising above 3.00 marks. Its primary aim hasbeen to keep British exports competitive in Europe. The poundwas quoted at 2.9806 marks yesterday in London after thereserves figures were announced.   The other major factor in the rise in reserves was aninflux of $1.54 billion from overseas buyers of BritishPetroleum Co. shares. Britain began its record $12.33 billionBP share offering last week.   But even after subtracting this &quot;BP effect,&quot; the $5.16billion increase exceeded the one-month record of $4.76billion set in May.</TEXT></DOC>
