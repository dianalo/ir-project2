Regulated areas are dividedinto high-risk areas and low-risk areas. Under the regulations an areais designated as a high-risk area when an inspector determines that regulatedarticles exist within or adjacent to an area where defoliation has occurredor where an inspector has reason to believe that 50 or more egg massesper acre of the gypsy moth are present. Low-risk areas are those portionsof regulated areas that are not designated as high-risk areas.Section 301.45-3 of the regulations imposed the following conditions onthe movement of regulated articles from gypsy moth regulated areas:(a) A regulated article shall not be moved interstate from any high-riskarea into or through any nonregulated area unless a certificate or permithas been issued and attached to such regulated articles in accordance withandSection;andSection; 301.45-4 and 301.45-7.(b) A regulated article shall not be moved interstate from any low-riskarea into or through any nonregulated area when it is determined by aninspector that any life stage of the gypsy moth is on the regulated article,and the person in possession thereof has been so notified by an inspector,unless a certificate or permit has been issued and attached to such articlesin accordance with andSection;andSection; 301.45-4 and 301.45-7.(c) A regulated article originating outside of any high-risk area, exceptany regulated article in any low-risk area determined by an inspector topresent a hazard of spreading the gypsy moth pursuant to paragraph (b)of this section, may be moved interstate directly through any high-riskarea without a certificate or permit, if the point of origin of the articleis clearly indicated by shipping documents, their identity has been maintained,and they have been safeguarded against infestation while in any high-riskarea.Section 301.45-11 of the regulations imposes the following conditions onthe interstate movement of outdoor household articles from gypsy moth high-riskareas:(a) No outdoor household article shall be moved interstate from a gypsymoth high-risk area into or through any nonregulated area unless:(1) Such outdoor household article is free from all life stages of thegypsy moth at the time of the interstate movement; or(2) Such outdoor household article is accompanied by an OHA document issuedby a qualified certified applicator in accordance with the provisions ofandSection;andSection; 301.45-12 and 301.45-13 within five calendar days ofthe interstate movement from a gypsy moth high-risk area; or(3) Such outdoor household articles are brought in by vacationers to thegypsy moth high-risk areas.These regulations are designed to restrict the interstate movement of regulatedarticles in those circumstances where there would be a significant riskof spread of gypsy moth. A certificate or limited permit is authorizedto be issued based on treatment of a regulated article or based on a determinationthat movement of a regulated article without treatment would not resultin the spread of the gypsy moth.<ITAG tagnum="84">Deletion of Areas From List of Regulated Areas and Removal of StatesFrom Quarantine</ITAG>We made several changes to the Gypsy Moth Quarantine and Regulations inan interim rule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 8, 1986 (51 FR 16993-17001, Docket No.85-343). The addition of Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsinto the list of states quarantined because of the gypsy moth was explainedin the supplementary information of the May 8, 1986, document. Althoughthat document amended andSection; 301.45-2a of the regulations by designatingportions of these states as low-risk areas, the designation of these statesas quarantined states was inadvertently omitted from the list of quarantinedstates in andSection; 301.45. However, for all practical purposes, thesestates have been treated as quarantined states.Prior to the effective date of this document, the following areas in Illinois,Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, Washington and Wisconsin were designated as gypsymoth low-risk regulated areas. This document removes these areas from thelist of gypsy moth low-risk areas:Illinois<T3>Kane County. </T3>SE\1/4\ sec. 3 and NE\1/4\ sec. 10, T. 39 N., R.8 E.<T3>Lake County. </T3>SE\1/4\ sec. 28, T. 43 N., R. 10 E.<T3>Peoria County. </T3>Sec. 28, T. 9 N., R. 8 E.Indiana<T3>Allen County. </T3>SE\1/4\ sec. 32, T. 30 N., R. 13 E.<T3>Marion County. </T3>SE\1/4\ sec. 20.

Accordingly, there is no longer a basis for continuing to list theseareas as regulated areas for the purpose of preventing the artificial spreadinterstate of gypsy moth. Therefore, as an emergency measure, it is necessaryto delete these areas from the list of regulated areas in order to deleteunnecessary restrictions on the movement of gypsy moth regulated articles.Further, the effect of deleting the above-described areas in Illinois,Indiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Washington from the list of gypsy mothregulated areas is to remove all areas in these states from the list ofregulated areas. As a result, there is no longer a basis for quarantiningIllinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin or Washington for gypsy moth. Therefore,insofar as Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin were quarantined,this document releases them from quarantine. This document also deletesWashington from the list of States quarantined because of gypsy moth inandSection;301.45(a). Ohio is not released from quarantine because previouslynonregulated areas are designated as low-risk areas, as explained below.This document corrects an earlier omission by adding Ohio to the list ofstates quarantined because of gypsy moth.<ITAG tagnum="84">Removal and Redesignation of Portions of Regulated Area in Lane County,Oregon; Designation of Areas as Low Risk Areas</ITAG>Prior to the effective date of this document, a portion of Lane County,Oregon, was designated as a gypsy moth high-risk area. This document removesa portion of the previously regulated area from quarantine and redesignatesthe remaining regulated area as a gypsy moth low-risk area. The newly designatedlow-risk area in Lane County, Oregon, is as follows:Oregon<T3>Lane County.</T3> That portion beginning at the northwest corner ofsec. 15, T. 17 S., R. 6 W.; then due east along the section lines to theintersection of the north boundary of sec. 15, T. 17 S., R. 3 W. and Interstate5; then north along Interstate 5 to its intersection with Coburg Road;then northwest along this road to its intersection with Powerline Road;then north along this road to its intersection with the north border ofsec. 7, T. 16 S., R. 3 W.; then due east along the section lines to thenortheast corner of Section 7, T. 16 S., R. 2 W.; then due south alongthe section lines to the southeast corner of sec. 31, T. 16 S., R. 2 W.;then due east along the section lines to the northeast corner of sec. 5,T. 17 S., R. 1 E.; then due north along the section lines to the northwestcorner of sec. 21, T. 16 S., R. 1 E.; then due east along the section linesto the northeast corner of sec. 20, T. 16 S., R. 2 E.; then due south alongthe section lines to the southeast corner of sec. 20, T. 17 S., R. 2 E.;then due west along the section lines to the southwest corner of sec. 23,T. 17 S., R. 1 E.; then due south along the section lines to the southeastcorner of sec. 10, T. 20 S., R. 1 E.; then due west along the section linesto the southwest corner of sec. 9, T. 20 S., R. 2 W.; then due south alongthe section lines to the intersection of the east border of sec. 32, T.20 S., R. 2 W. and Row River Road; then west along this road to DorenaDam; then south along Dorena Dam spillway to a point intersecting the southboundary of sec. 32, T. 20 S., R. 2 W.; then due west along the sectionlines to the southwest corner of sec. 34, T. 20 S., R. 5 W.; then due northalong the section lines to the northwest corner of sec. 10, T. 20 S., R.5 W.; then due east along the section lines to the northeast corner ofsec. 9, T. 20 S., R. 3 W.; then due north along the section lines to thenorthwest corner of sec. 27, T. 18 S., R. 3 W.; then due west along thesection lines to the southwest corner of sec. 20, T. 18 S., R. 4 W.; thendue north along the section lines to the northwest corner of sec. 5, T.18 S., R. 4 W.; then due west along the section lines to the southwestcorner of sec. 34, T. 17 S., R. 6 W.; then due north along the sectionlines to the starting point.This document also designates previously nonregulated areas in Maine, Maryland,Michigan, and Ohio as gypsy moth low-risk areas. These newly designatedlow-risk areas are the following:Maine<T3>Penobscot County.</T3> The townships of Sherman and Stacyville.MarylandThe entire counties of Calvert, Charles, St. Marys, and Somerset.MichiganThe entire counties of Alcona, Allegan, Alpena, Antrim, Barry, Benzie,Berrien, Cass, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Crawford, Emmet, Grand Traverse,Hillsdale, Kalamazoo, Kalkaska, Kent, Lake, Leelamau, Manistee, Mason,Monroe, Montmorency, Muskegon, Oceana, Oscoda, Otsego, Ottawa, PresqueIsle, St. Joseph, Van Buren, and Wexford.OhioThe entire counties of Ashtabula, Geauga, Lake, and Trumbull.Based on recent surveys, inspectors have determined that infestations ofgypsy moth occur in these areas designated as gypsy moth low-risk areas,but that the number of egg masses per acre is not high enough to meet thecriteria referred to above for gypsy moth high-risk areas.The restrictions concerning the gypsy moth are imposed on movements ofregulated articles from gypsy moth low-risk areas only if it is determinedby an inspector that any life stage of the gypsy moth is on the regulatedarticle, and the person in possession thereof has been notified by an inspector,unless a certificate or permit has been issued and attached to the regulatedarticle in accordance with andSection;andSection;301.45-4 and 301.45-7 of theregulations. It is necessary to designate these areas as gypsy moth low-riskareas in order to advise persons of the likelihood that inspectors wouldconduct inspections in these areas and that, based on their findings oflife stages of gypsy moth, restrictions could apply to the movement ofregulated articles from the areas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Designation of Areas as High-Risk Areas</ITAG>This document designates previously nonregulated areas in Virginia andWest Virginia as gypsy moth high-risk areas and redesignates areas in Michigan,New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia from gypsy moth low-risk areas togypsy moth high-risk areas. These areas are indicated below. If a portionof a county is designated, the specific area is set forth in the regulationsportion of this document.Michigan The entire counties of Arenac, Bay, Genesee, Gladwin, Gratiot, Huron, Iosco,Lapeer, Mecosta, Missaukee, Montcalm, Ogemaw, Osceola, Roscommon, Saginaw,Sanilac, Shiawassee, St. Clair, and Tuscola; and Portions of Clare, Isabella, Midland, and Oakland counties. New York The entire counties of Genesee, Lewis, Niagara, Orleans, Wayne, and Wyoming;and Portions of Cayuga, Chenango, Cortland, Erie, Jefferson, Livingston, Madison,Oneida, Onondaga, Ontario, Oswego, Seneca, and St. Lawrence counties. Pennsylvania The entire counties of Armstrong, Crawford, and Fayette. Virginia The entire cities of Charlottesville, Chesapeake, Fredericksburg, Hampton,Harrisonburg, Manassas Park, Newport News, Norfolk, Poquoson, Portsmouth,Virginia Beach, and Waynesboro; and The entire counties of Accomack, Albemarle, Augusta, Caroline, Culpeper,Fluvanna, Gloucester, Goochland, Greene, Hanover, Henrico, King George,Lancaster, Louisa, Madison, Mathews, Middlesex, Northampton, Northumberland,Orange, Powhatan, Richmond, Rockingham, Spotsylvania, Stafford, Westmoreland,and York; and Portions of Augusta, Fauquier, Page, and Rappahannock Counties. West Virginia The entire counties of Barbour, Grant, Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral, Monongalia,Pendleton, Preston, and Tucker. Based on recent surveys, inspectors have determined with respect to allof the areas added to the list of gypsy moth high-risk areas, that defoliationhas occurred in these areas because of the gypsy moth or that there isreason to believe that 50 or more egg masses per acre of the gypsy mothare present in these areas. Also, outdoor household articles and regulatedarticles exist within or adjacent to these areas. Accordingly, there isa substantial risk of artificially spreading the gypsy moth by unrestrictedinterstate movement of these articles. Therefore, as an emergency measure,it is necessary to designate these areas as gypsy moth high-risk areasand impose restrictions on the interstate movement of outdoor householdarticles and regulated articles from these areas in accordance with theregulations in order to prevent the artificial spread of the gypsy moth.<ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Action </ITAG>James W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, has determined that a situation exists that warrants publicationof this rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Because of thepossibility that the gypsy moth could be spread artificially to noninfestedareas of the United States, it is necessary to act immediately to controlits spread. Also, where gypsy moth no longer occurs, or when there is reasonto believe that the density of egg masses per acre has decreased sufficientlyto remove the area from a gypsy moth high-risk or low-risk area classification,immediate action is needed to remove unnecessary restrictions on the interstatemovement of regulated articles. Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this ruleare impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions,there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 for making this rule effective uponpublication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. We will consider comments postmarked or receivedwithin 60 days of publication of this interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Any amendments we make to this interim ruleas a result of these comments will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> following the close of the comment period. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on information compiledby the Department, we have determined that this rule will have an effecton the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individuals, industries, federal, state,or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will not causea significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291. This action affects the interstate movement of regulated articles fromgypsy moth regulated areas in Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan,Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington,West Virginia, and Wisconsin. For areas designated as high-risk areas,individual and commercial movers moving outdoor household articles to areasoutside the quarantined area must determine that their articles are freeof gypsy moth. Mobile home haulers, loggers, nurserymen, and firewood haulersare required to obtain certification or limited permit from an inspectorthat their articles are free of gypsy moth. For areas designated as low-riskareas, the same conditions apply for movement of regulated articles whenit is determined by an inspector that the movement of an article presentsa hazard of spreading the gypsy moth. For areas determined to be free ofgypsy moth and deregulated, no restrictions are imposed for movement ofregulated articles. All regulated articles are inspected and certified without charge to thebusiness. A business not requesting this service in advance of shipmentmay be delayed in moving the product until service can be provided. A homeownermoving outdoor household articles from a high-risk area to an uninfestedarea may pay a qualified certified applicator (QCA) to inspect his goods.These charges average between $50-100. In some instances the company movingthat person reimburses the mover for their expense. Most QCA's are smallbusinesses. By declaring an area as a high-risk area the regulations mayincrease business for the QCA's located in high-risk areas. These businesseswill average $50 to $150 per month in additional income per business. Approximately90 new businesses will be trained to inspect outdoor household articlesand will offer this service to the general public. Based on informationcompiled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture it has been determined thatthere are many hundreds of small entities that move regulated articlesinterstate from gypsy moth regulated areas and many thousands of smallentities that move regulated articles interstate from other states. However,based on such information, it has been determined that approximately 759small entities move regulated articles interstate from the specified areasaffected by this action. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372 which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
