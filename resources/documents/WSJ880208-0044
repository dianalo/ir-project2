For the moment, the U.S. is the sole supplier of beans on the world market. But this spring Brazil and Argentina are expected to harvest record-breaking crops. Already, these prospective crops have depressed soybean futures prices by 3% to 4% at the Chicago Board of Trade. Traders say potential customers for U.S. beans are holding off on major purchases in the hope of getting better deals from Brazil or Argentina.    &quot;Every day that passes and every rain shower that you get eliminates potential crop damage,&quot; said Mickey Luth, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago. Some analysts estimate the potentially huge South American crop may reach 28 million metric tons, 14% more than last year and 12% bigger than the record output of 1985.    This looming bumper harvest underscores the mixed signals that the U.S. has been sending lately to its major agricultural competitors. In an attempt to reduce mammoth world stocks and lift depressed prices U.S. farm programs encourage farmers to idle cropland. Last year some 70 million acres of cropland -- a land mass the size of Colorado -- were taken out of production. U.S. bean acreage being tilled fell to its lowest level since 1976.    But rather than follow suit, foreign competitors have viewed U.S. limits as an opportunity to expand. Brazil and Argentina planted nearly six million acres of soybeans last fall, a 41% increase from 1982, when U.S. soybean acreage was at its peak.    &quot;A bigger U.S. crop would have meant larger supply and lower prices with less incentive for the Brazilians to plant,&quot; said Mr. Luth.    As it stands, soybean meal prices are likely to be most affected by the South American crop. Brazil is expected to crush most of its crop, turning the soybeans into soybean meal and soybean oil, then consume much of the oil and sell the meal. The prospect of that has dropped meal futures contracts for spring and summer delivery an average of $6.13 a ton since the beginning of January. On Friday, the contract for May settlement closed at $178.70 a ton, down 70 cents.    Analysts are quick to point out that the declines would be even steeper if world demand for soybeans and bean products weren't steadily rising. This fall, the Soviets returned to U.S. meal markets after a seven-year absence. Their buying spree -- a total of 1.3 million tons was purchased -- lifted prices to three-year highs and sharply reduced government soybean stockpiles.    Moreover, analysts and traders worry that despite increases in world demand, the U.S. land-idling policies may be positioning U.S. farmers to lose rather than gain market share.    Analysts and traders are waiting for the Agriculture Department's March 31 announcement of farmers' spring planting decisions. How big an increase in domestic production might be indicated then is still open to debate.    Although cash prices, now at $5.96 a bushel, are 25% higher than year-earlier levels, several economists say it would take about $7 a bushel to entice farmers to leave the safety of ensured profits in government farm programs. These programs, which guarantee prices for wheat, corn and other feed grains, provide little incentive for bean plantings.    If U.S. soybean farmers don't respond to the growing demand by increasing plantings, it is likely Brazil and Argentina will. &quot;This doesn't bode well for U.S. farmers,&quot; said Steve Freed, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. &quot;Brazil is planting on about half of the land they can plant on. If prices stay around this level it could encourage more (foreign) production.&quot;    If the 1988 U.S. crop only matches last fall's 52.5 million metric-ton harvest, surpluses are likely to shrink further and prices are likely to rise. But most of the benefits will be realized overseas. Price increases at the end of the growing season would occur just as the South American planting season begins, giving them first crack at expanding to meet demand.    &quot;We'll be allowing prices to go up high enough so that they will continue to encourage foreign expansion,&quot; says Richard Loewy, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. &quot;Our farmers get caught holding the bag.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
