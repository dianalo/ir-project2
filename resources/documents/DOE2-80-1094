The latest large eruptionsof this volcano took place at two recent times the present lava domeextruded at the summit crater, only small phreatic eruptions have occurredat other times. At the latest small phreatic eruption in 1981, intensiveseismic activity occurred, but after that the seismic activity graduallydecayed and now stays in very low level. On the contrary, the geothermalactivity at the souther half of the summit dome and the surrounding areahas increased. Since 1981, small tilt recurrent levellings and continuousobservation of tilting have been carried out by Usu Volcano Observatory.The results of measurements at the northeastern, southeastern and southwesternnets,show that the center of the summit atrio where the dome is locatedseems to be upheaved. The result of measurements at the northwesternnet where there is no significant geothermal anomaly, however, revealesreverse tilt change which shows that the dome side down. The tilt changesseem to be related with the geothermal activities at the summit, butthis does not actually mean the dome increased in height. Further tiltmeasurements may be necessary in order to clarify what the tilt changesmeans. (4 figs, 1 tab, 18 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
