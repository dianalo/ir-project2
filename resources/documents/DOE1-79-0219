One factor in the revivalof interest is the widely shared concern over potential natural-resourceshortages resulting from rapid world population and economic growth.Resource problems cause various types of threats to different countries.This study represents an effort to incorporate an ecological dimensioninto national security planning. Concentrating on South Korea, it explorestwo general concerns: enhancing carrying capacity, and evaluating supplysecurity. South Korea has a very deficient natural resource endowmentdespite having one of the highest population densities in the world.The findings can be generalized into theoretical and policy arguments:(1) an adequate supply of natural resources is seen as vital to nationalsecurity; (2) foreign trade is seen as a useful instrument to improvea nation's resource position, but heavy involvement in internationaltrade causes other security problems of sensitivity and vulnerability;and (3) national supply security is determined by the varying supplyconditions and the variable policy planning to avoid any supply interruptions.</TEXT></DOC>
