Schwartz, president and chief executive officer, said. That would be up from $61,000, or four cents a share, a year earlier.    Revenue is estimated to have jumped to $1.7 million from $1.3 million.    Healthwatch, which operates eight outpatient-care centers in the Denver area, expects to post net for the fiscal first half of $220,000 to $240,000, equal to 12 or 13 cents a share, compared with $100,000, or six cents a share, the year before. The company estimates six-month revenue at $3.2 million, a 60% increase from the year-earlier $2 million.    Mr. Schwartz said a rise in the average charge per patient as well as an increase in the total number of patients fueled the earnings increase. He said the company expects to see about 100,000 patients in fiscal 1988, compared with 80,000 in 1987. The average charge per patient rose to $59 at the end of 1987 from $51 in 1986.    The company is negotiating to buy additional care centers in another city and expects to complete at least one acquisition in the third quarter, Mr. Schwartz said in an interview. With the acquisition, Healthwatch should double the number of its centers by the end of 1988, he said.    Healthwatch expects to earn $700,000, or 40 cents a share, on revenue of about $7 million in fiscal 1988. This compares with profit of $288,000, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $4.9 million in fiscal 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
