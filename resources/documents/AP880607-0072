The latest session, at the Alliance of Motion Picture andTelevision Producers headquarters, ended at 2 a.m. today, Ms. Rhodensaid. The next round of talks was scheduled for 1:30 this afternoon,she added.   The two sides began meeting Friday.   Ms. Rhoden declined to comment on the issues discussed.   The writers walked out March 7 in a dispute centering on paymentsor residuals for reruns of one-hour television shows. Demand forsuch programs in rerun, or syndication, is declining, and theproducers want to tie payments to a show's success in the rerunmarket.   The two sides also have been at odds over writers' demands formore creative control over changes made in scripts during filmingand more on- and off-screen credit.   The guild has signed full-term contracts with about 80independent producers, but the alliance contends none of its largemembers has signed and the producers who did defect employ only afraction of the writers.</TEXT></DOC>
