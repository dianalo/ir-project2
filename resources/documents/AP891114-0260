The orders and options announced Tuesday are in addition to $13billion in plane orders announced earlier by the Atlanta-basedcarrier. Delta has orders and options now on a total of 519 newjets.   Delta Chairman Ronald W. Allen said the new aircraft are neededto keep the carrier's fleet modern by replacing older planes and tosupport the airline's planned expansion in the next decade. Thecurrent fleet has an average age of 8{ years.   Delta will become the first customer for the MD-90, the latestin the St. Louis-based aircraft maker's MD series. Delta has ordersfor 50 of the jets and options for another 110.   The McDonnell Douglas jets are scheduled to be deliveredbeginning late in 1994.   The MD-90s will be powered by International Aero Engines' V2500series engines. For Delta's use, the MD-90s will seat 150passengers.   Separately, Business Express Airlines of Westport, Conn., aDelta connection carrier in the Northeast and eastern Canada, saidit had agreed to buy up to $250 million worth of commercialairplanes from Saab Scania.   The plans announced Tuesday by Delta also include orders for 50Boeing 737s and options for another 50. Delta said these planeswill be delivered starting in 1993.   Seattle-based Boeing's machinists, however, were in the 42nd dayof a strike Monday that has virtually halted production of newairplanes.   The 737-300s will add to Delta's Boeing fleet, which alsoincludes 727s, 757s and 767s.   The Boeing 737-300s will seat 120 passengers and will have CFMInternational's CFM56-3 series engines.   Delta said the engines for both the MD-90s and the 737s arehighly fuel efficient and meet the quieter Stage III engine noisereduction standards.   The investment in the aircraft includes spare engines and parts,Delta said.   Allen, speaking to a convention of bankers earlier this week,said that Delta plans considerable expansion during the 1990s andthat jet purchases are a major part of the company's strategy.   ``We have a tremendous amount of growth planned ahead for DeltaAir Lines,'' Allen said. ``Many of these airplanes will be used tomaintain a modern fleet. To do that, of course, we have to keepreplenishing our fleet and replacing our old airplanes.''   He also said the plans make Delta officials leery of anyinvolvement in a debt-financed takeover. Delta often is mentionedas an attractive acquisition target.   ``We want to be positioned to fly through a recession and tocontinue to grow through a recession,'' Allen said. ``We have a bigcommitment to (buy new) airplanes. We cannot maintain thatcommitment if we're heavily leveraged, particularly during arecession.''</TEXT></DOC>
