The maker of tools and hardware reported third-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $27.8 million, or 63 cents a share. A $3 million loss from discontinued operations, plus a $3.7 million loss on disposition of those operations, made net $21 million, or 48 cents a share. Stanley divested itself of three specialty-steel producers this year. It also has sold part of Stanley Structures Inc., a Denver-based maker of concrete structures, and is negotiating to sell the rest of the unit.    A year earlier, earnings from continuing operations were $20.5 million. A $79,000 loss on discontinued operations resulted in net of $20.4 million. Per-share net was 48 cents in both periods because more shares were outstanding in the latest one.    Sales surged 29%, to $454.4 million, from the restated $350.9 million a year earlier. The company attributed the improvement largely to higher volume and to price and currency gains. Both recent acquisitions and older businesses contributed to the volume gains, Stanley said.    Richard H. Ayers, president and chief executive officer, said the company expects record sales and earnings for the year and is &quot;well-positioned for strong world-wide performance in 1988.&quot; For 1986, the company had record sales of $1.37 billion and record net of $78.7 million, or $1.86 a share.    For the first nine months, earnings from continuing operations rose 27% to $70.2 million, or $1.61 a share, from $55.2 million, or $1.31 a share, a year earlier. Including operating and disposal losses totaling $9.7 million, net for the period rose 7.5% to $60.5 million, or $1.39 a share. In the year-earlier period, net was $56.3 million, or $1.33 a share, including $1 million in profit from discontinued operations.    Sales for the period rose 32%, to $1.3 billion, from the restated $987 million a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
