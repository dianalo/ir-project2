Pete Wilson ofCalifornia, said they were encouraged enough to introduce a plan for low-cost,no-fault auto insurance that would run about $220 a year.;    Sen. PatrickJohnston, D-Stockton, who has been pushing a similar proposal for more thantwo years, said Wednesday that he will put the plan into a bill Friday, thelast day to introduce legislation this year.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  California News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NO-FAULT CAR INSURANCE BILL REVIVED  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     An identical no-fault bill will be introduced in the Assembly byAssemblyman Bill Lancaster, R-Covina.;    Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, D-SanFrancisco, is also drafting a low-cost auto insurance bill likely to besimilar to one that passed the Legislature in 1989 but was vetoed by formerGov. George Deukmejian.;    That bill would have reduced the coverage requiredfor low-income drivers and would have mandated a variety of safety and otherrequirements aimed at reducing the cost of supplying insurance, but it wouldnot have changed liability laws.;    Under Johnston's plan, California driverswould no longer be required to carry liability insurance to pay for injuriesto people in the other car.;    Instead, drivers would buy a much-cheaperminimum policy under which they would collect the first $15,000 in lost wagesand medical expenses from their own companies. Drivers could opt for moreextensive coverage, including protection against lawsuits, which would only beallowed if injuries were serious or permanent.;    Johnston, Lancaster and ahandful of others met with Wilson earlier this week to get a sense of thegovernor's position on auto insurance, a sticky issue that had confounded theLegislature and Deukmejian for years.;    Wilson, who has supported thegeneral idea of no-fault in the past, did not take a position on the plan,according to a governor's spokesman. Johnston was still heartened by themeeting.;    &quot;The governor asked questions and clearly was seekinginformation,&quot; Johnston said. &quot;That is a big contrast to the previous governorwho simply showed no interest in the subject matter, let alone any specificproposal. It was encouraging.&quot;;    However, Johnston said his bill still has a&quot;less than 50-50&quot; chance to survive the Legislature. In 1989 and 1990, whenJohnston was an assemblyman, similar bills died in Assembly committees.;   Johnston's proposal, along with Brown's, is likely to be part of a months-longprocess of haggling, maneuvering and negotiating that could result in verydifferent bills, said lawmakers, lobbyists and others involved in theinsurance fight.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  McClatchy News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Sacramento  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910307  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  414  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday March 7, 199100067009,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
