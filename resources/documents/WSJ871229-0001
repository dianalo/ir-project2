The White House appeal helped the dollar stage a modest recovery from historic lows in overseas trading, but traders and economists continued to predict that it will take more than words from the Reagan administration to restore the dollar's health.    Stock and bond prices tumbled yesterday as well, in part reacting to the dollar's initial weakness. The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded 56.70 points, to 1942.97, on light volume of 131.2 million shares. Bond prices were generally lower, with the 30-year Treasury bond off about $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Stocks and bonds narrowed their losses slightly late in the day, after the White House statement was issued shortly before 2 p.m. EST.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in Los Angeles, where the president is vacationing, that &quot;the United States wants to see stability in the dollar.&quot; Borrowing language from an agreement announced by the Group of Seven allied industrial countries last week, Mr. Fitzwater said: &quot;We feel strongly that any further decline or excessive fluctuation could be counterproductive.&quot;    The dollar rose about half a Japanese yen after the statement, in a thin year-end market. But analysts and traders said they had heard such statements before and predicted the effects of the pronouncement would quickly fade.    In early trading Tuesday in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 123.50 yen, up from 123.38 at the open of trading in Japan, but down slightly from 123.55 at Monday's Tokyo close. Sources said the Bank of Japan intervened minutes after the start of Tokyo trading Tuesday, buying a &quot;small amount&quot; of dollars at 123.40 yen.    Mr. Fitzwater declined to say what further steps the U.S. might take to boost the dollar's value. Some analysts say that without higher interest rates in the U.S., the dollar will continue to fall. But officials at the Federal Reserve and in the Reagan administration have made it clear that they are still reluctant to boost interest rates to support the dollar.    Indeed, some administration officials, including White House economic adviser Beryl Sprinkel, argue the Fed should ease monetary policy -- a move that could keep interest rates down and push the dollar still lower.    Official reaction to the dollar's drop was muted yesterday in part because so few government officials were in Washington. Treasury Secretary James Baker, as well as most of his top advisers and most members of the Federal Reserve Board were on vacation.    In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 123.65 yen, down 1.7% from the previous New York quote of 125.82 yen late Thursday. It also stood at 1.5980 West German marks, down 1.4% from 1.6200 late Thursday.    The currency reached intraday lows of 122.90 yen during European trading and 1.5880 marks in Tokyo activity. Both were its lowest levels since the modern exchange-rate system was established shortly after World War II, eclipsing a series of lows set last week and over the weekend.    The dollar also was trading yesterday at its lowest level in at least 30 years against the Swiss franc and the lowest since 1981 against the French franc, according to data from Irving Trust Co., New York. The British pound rose as high as $1.8750, its highest since early 1982, before settling at $1.8612 late yesterday in New York. The London market was closed for the Boxing Day holiday.    As the dollar struggled to recover from its latest ebbs yesterday, economists and traders cited a long list of reasons for expecting the currency to head even lower when 1988 begins.    --The Group of Seven's statement last week that the major industrial nations don't want to see any substantial further fall in the dollar's value wasn't backed by any specific pledge of action and has been written off by the markets as basically &quot;worthless,&quot; according to Steven Cerier, senior financial economist at McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei Inc., New York.    --With presidential and congressional elections coming up in November, U.S. political leaders will tend to &quot;take the path of least resistance, which is to let the exchange rate fall,&quot; Francoise Soares-Kemp, treasury vice president for Credit Suisse in New York, said. Most U.S. voters, she said, &quot;won't care whether the dollar is at 1.60 marks or 1.20.&quot;    --When traders and major clients return to the market in force next week, &quot;they'll be taking short positions (in effect, selling dollars) to test the central banks' resolve,&quot; John Lynam, vice president in New York for Los Angeles-based Security Pacific National Bank, said. That could set off a further decline unless the U.S. and its allies are prepared to continue buying large quantities of dollars to prop up the currency's value. Many traders and economists expressed doubt that the governments are making the purchases, citing the unwelcome surge in money-supply growth in West Germany and Japan that already has resulted from this year's intervention efforts.    --Much of the dollar-selling in the Tokyo market in recent days has been done by major commercial customers, not currency speculators, according to Eishi Wakabayashi, executive vice president of Nippon Kangyo Kakamura International Inc., the New York unit of a Japanese securities concern. This indicates a fundamental concern with the dollar's weakness that will be difficult to overcome, he said.    --In the longer term, fuller evidence of how badly the October stock market crash affected the U.S. economy might not come until data on retail sales and consumer spending for the first months of 1988 are released in February and March, Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, said. If those reports indicate weakness in the economy, he said, the U.S. Federal Reserve may be forced to ease money by letting interest rates fall. That would further weaken the appeal of short-term dollar investments.    Most of the dollar's decline came in Asian and European trading, despite intervention by several major central banks, as most markets were reopening after the Christmas holiday weekend. The move extended the decline it had posted in extremely thin trading in Tokyo Friday and the Middle East Saturday.    Mr. Cerier of McCarthy Crisanti and several traders also said there were signs of &quot;very light&quot; intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve in the New York market, where trading continued to be seasonally thin.    Once the year-end doldrums are over, however, Mr. Cerier said, &quot;January could be very bloody&quot; for the U.S. currency.    &quot;We're going to open very weak in the new year,&quot; he said. Central bank intervention may be stepped up then, but it probably won't have much effect, he said. With the U.S. apparently unwilling to raise interest rates substantially to defend the dollar, Mr. Cerier said, the currency's only short-term hope for a turnaround would be an improvement in the U.S. trade balance.    The U.S. is scheduled to report on Jan. 15 its merchandise trade balance for November. The dollar is still reeling from some previous disappointing trade figures, especially the record $17.6 billion October deficit posted this month. If the trade gap doesn't start to shrink soon, Mr. Cerier said, &quot;I don't have a bottom for the dollar.&quot;    The only positive note for the dollar at present, according to Ms. Soares-Kemp, is that &quot;most people (in the market) are flat&quot; and don't have any more dollars to sell. &quot;There is no market, to be honest,&quot; she said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.60 an ounce to $487.70 in light trading. Estimated volume was 1.9 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $488.35 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---   Ellen Hume in Los Angeles contributed to this article.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Monday, Dec. 28, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
