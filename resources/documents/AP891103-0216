Foreign Minister Pik Botha of South Africa said Wednesday thatU.N. peacekeepers radioed each other about more than 600 fightersof the South-West Africa People's Organization infiltrating fromOct. 23 to Tuesday.   U.N. officials in Namibia examined transcripts of the radiomessages provided by South Africa and pronounced them ``forgeries''that did not conform to the style or content of radio transmissionsby U.N. peacekeepers.   ``The Security Council deplores the false alarm by South Africaon Nov. 1 concerning the alleged movement of SWAPO forces acrossthe Angola-Namibia border,'' said the statement, adoptedunanimously by the 15 council members.   ``The Council expresses its profound concern about this incidentas well as the potential implications for the elections of theinitial South African reaction to it.''   Botha had put South Africa put troops on alert and said hisnation was prepared to take action even if such action delayed theU.N.-supervised elections scheduled to begin Tuesday.   The Security Council said it ``calls on South Africa to desistfrom any such further actions.''   An estimated 1,600 SWAPO guerrillas did cross into Namibia onApril 1, apparently intending to surrender their weapons to U.N.peacekeepers and be confined to base, like 1,500 South Africansoldiers confined to barracks under U.N. supervision.   However, that action violated the southern Africa peaceagreement that called for all SWAPO fighters to be in bases wellnorth of the Namibian border.   U.N. officials allowed South African-led Namibian police andSouth African troops to meet the SWAPO fighters, leading to offclashes that killed at least 273 guerrillas and 23 South Africansecurity force members.   Between April and November, South Africa raised at least twofalse alarms about impending guerrilla incursions, according tonews reports and U.N. officials.   On Tuesday through Nov. 11, Namibians are to vote for aconstituent assembly that will adopt a constitution for theterritory of over 1.3 million, leading it to independence with ablack majority-ruled government next year.   South Africa captured the territory from Germany in World War I,and has governed it since. In 1966, the General Assembly canceled amandate from the League of Nations allowing South Africa toadminister Namibia, but South Africa continued its rule.   Last year, South Africa agreed to cooperate with the U.N. planfor Namibia's transition to independence when Cuba agreedsimultaneously to withdraw its 50,000 soldiers from neighboringAngola.</TEXT></DOC>
