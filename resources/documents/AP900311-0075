Augusto Pinochet surrendered thegovernment to elected President Patricio Aylwin on Sunday, ending16{ years of military rule and completing South America'stransition to civilian government.   However, Pinochet remains chief of the 60,000-member army,despite a request from Aylwin that he give up that powerful post.   Street celebrations of the partial return of democracy touchedoff scattered disturbances in downtown Santiago. Bands of leftistyouths blocked streets with burning debris and clashed with police.More than 20 people were reported injured.   To thunderous applause and cheers, Aylwin put on the red, whiteand blue presidential sash in the inaugural ceremony in Valparaiso,a seaport city 70 miles northwest of Santiago.   ``Chile returns to democracy without violence, without blood,without hate,'' he later told supporters in Santiago. ``Chilereturns by the road of peace.''   Aylwin's first official act was to pardon all politicalprisoners under the Pinochet regime.   Pinochet shook the new president's hand at the inauguration andthen quickly left the hall, where his entrance brought competingchants of ``Pinochet! Pinochet!'' and ``Murderer! Murderer!'' fromthe galleries.   Upon the 74-year-old Army general's arrival for the ceremony, agroup of protesters tossed tomatoes, stones and other objects atPinochet's open-top limosine and shouted insults.   The car, surrounded by military bodyguards, momentarily sped up.It bumped into a soldier on horseback, but no injuries werereported.   A military band saluted Pinochet as he left the ceremony, heldin a half-finished congressional palace being built to house anelected senate and house of deputies, which also assumed powerSunday. Under Pinochet, a military junta had acted as thelegislature.   Aylwin, a 71-year-old centrist politician, won elections inDecember. A Christian Democrat, he is backed by a coalition of 17centrist and leftist parties.   He has vowed to restore respect for human rights and civilliberties and put more emphasis on social services for the poor.But he plans no major changes in Pinochet's largely successfulfree-market economic program.   Sunday evening, Aylwin stood on the balcony of the presidentialpalace in Santiago and urged Chileans to put aside differences andunite behind democracy.   Hundreds of thousands of jubilant Chileans lined the route intoSantiago from Valparaiso to cheer Aylwin's motorcade. They packedthe square in front of the presidential palace, waving banners andchanting anti-Pinochet slogans.   Just before Aylwin spoke, some celebrants broke through a policeline beside the palace, and police scattered them with tear gas.First-aid workers at a nearby hotel treated three peopleoverwhelmed by the gas and one man who was bleeding from the head,according to witnesses.   As evening approached, people clashed with police up and downthe capital's main boulevard. Authorities used tear gas and watercannons.   Several people were seen bleeding or otherwise hurt, and localradio stations reported about 20 people injured. Police hauled offsome protesters, but a police spokesman said he had no total forarrests.   Pinochet was obliged to call the election when voters, in a 1988referendum, rejected an extension of his rule to 1997.   A clause in the 1980 constitution, written by Pinochet'sadministration, bars any new president from replacing him as armycommander before 1998. Aylwin's term ends in 1994.   Pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, ending a longdemocratic tradition in Chile. He toppled the elected government ofPresident Salvador Allende, an avowed Marxist, during a period ofeconomic and social turmoil.   The general began his last morning as president by receivingVice President Dan Quayle at his home in eastern Santiago for a30-minute private meeting.   Pinochet supporters outside booed and jeered Quayle. ``Gringo,understand, Chile isn't for sale,'' some chanted. Others held upsigns saying, ``Go Home.''   Pinochet has bitterly criticized the United States forsupporting the push for democracy in Chile and for cutting offweapons sales to Chile in 1976 because of systematic human rightsviolations.   The arms embargo was proposed by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,D-Mass., who came to Chile with Quayle and attended theinauguration. The embargo remains in effect.   ``This is the dawn of a new era,'' Quayle said in Valparaiso.``Democracy is here. We hope it is here to stay.''   ``I'm proud of what the Chilean people have done,'' Kennedy said.   Chile is the last in a series of South American countries torestore elected civilian rule in the last decade, ending thedominance of authoritarian military leaders.   Also in Chile for the inauguration was Joyce Horman, the widowof Charles Horman. He was an American free-lance journalist whosearrest and slaying during the 1973 coup inspired the movie``Missing.''   According to the family and testimony collected by human rightsgroups, Horman was among many suspected dissidents held andexecuted at Santiago's National Stadium. The military governmenthas denied the allegations.   Mrs. Horman of New York was invited by the new government andwas expected to attend several events surrounding the inauguration.   In his first act as president, Aylwin decreed a pardon for all``prisoners of conscience'' jailed by the Pinochet government.   About 450 people are imprisoned for politically related crimes,although most are charged in connection with guerrilla activity.Aylwin has said he opposes freeing anyone guilty of blood crimes,and it was not immediately clear whom the pardon would affect.   As the change in government was taking place, many foreign headsof state were arriving _ having delayed their visits untilPinochet's rule was formally ended. They included presidents CarlosAndres Perez of Venezuela, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Alan Garciaof Peru, and prime ministers Felipe Gonzalez of Spain and GiulioAndreotii of Italy.   In Santiago, thousands of Pinochet supporters lined a two-milestretch to bid him farewell before he attended a final militarymass and flew off to the Valparaiso ceremony.   ``You will return,'' many chanted. Some wept openly. The crowdsrepeatedly surged through police lines trying to touch the general,who was in an open car.   The crowd grabbed and punched reporters accompanying Pinochet,who repeatedly has accused the press of unfairly attacking his ruleand exaggerating human rights abuses.   In Santiago, small bombs were tossed from moving taxis at ornear the homes of three military officers, police said. Only minordamage was reported, and no one claimed responsibility for theattacks.   Leftist extremist groups have operated in Chile for years, butit is widely speculated that many of the attacks attributed to themare carried out by right-wing organizations trying to dramatize theleftist threat.</TEXT></DOC>
