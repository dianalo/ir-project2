McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s net income fell sharply, butthat was because of a year-earlier gain from the settlementof certain pension-fund obligations. Operating earnings atthe St. Louis concern climbed more than fivefold, led by astrong showing at its commercial aircraft division.   Meanwhile, General Dynamics Corp. reported a 4.4% increasein net. Earnings from continuing operations, which excluderesults from the company's Cessna commercial aircraftsubsidiary, jumped 7%. General Dynamics, also based in St.Louis, announced last week that it's planning to divestitself of Cessna.</LP><TEXT>   Underlying the results were two divergent strategies.McDonnell Douglas has pinned its hopes on further improvementin its commercial aircraft lines. The company reiterated itsintention to bolster those operations by possibly embarking&quot;on strategic alliances with partners in other parts of theworld, principally the Asia/Pacific region.&quot;   General Dynamics, on the other hand, is bent on &quot;focusingon . . . our defense businesses,&quot; said Chairman WilliamAnders. By better managing its resources and only taking onPentagon projects that promise a reasonable return, thecompany figures it can thrive during the industry's downturn.   Either way, the quarter marked the continuation of aremarkable turnabout for both companies. In January,McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics were sent reeling whenthe Pentagon canceled the Navy's A-12 aircraft program,citing huge cost overruns and delays by the twomanufacturers. Since then, they have hunkered down, cuttingcosts and implementing more iron-handed financial controls.   Investors have taken notice. McDonnell Douglas shares hita January low of $26.50, but they've soared since, and werequoted at $71.50, up 62.5 cents, in late trading Friday onthe New York Stock Exchange. General Dynamics, whose shareprice also has more than doubled since the A-12 termination,was quoted in late Big Board trading at $50.125, up 37.5cents.   PaineWebber Inc.'s Jack Modzelewski said that bothcompanies still face plenty of risks, with the Pentagonbudget shrinking. That's especially true of McDonnellDouglas, which eventually may be forced to take write-downson several of its military aircraft programs and isstruggling to regain market share in the commercial airlinerbusiness.   Nonetheless, said Mr. Modzelewski: &quot;Let's face it, they'remaking progress.&quot;   McDonnell Douglas earned $77 million, or $2.02 a share,compared with $248 million, or $6.46 a share, a year earlier.The latter figure includes a $234 million, or $6.11-a-share,gain from the adjustment made to the pension funds. Revenuerose 8.8% to $4.47 billion from $4.11 billion.   There were a few weak spots, including write-downs takenat the company's missiles division and at its financesubsidiary. In all, the charges cost McDonnell Douglas about50 cents a share. Also, the company managed to ship only sixof its new MD-11 jetliners during the quarter, two fewer thanhad been planned. That means reaching its goal of 36 MD-11deliveries this year may be impossible. &quot;In all candor, wemay be a little short on that,&quot; acknowledged Herbert Lanese,McDonnell Douglas's chief financial officer.   Still, overall, the company appears to be moving in theright direction. The company's transport-aircraft segmentearned $65 million in the quarter compared with a $98 millionloss a year earlier. The commercial jetliner programs,excluding any unusual items, earned $73 million vs. a loss of$5 million last year. Mr. Lanese anticipated thatfourth-quarter earnings would be &quot;a lot stronger&quot; across theboard.   At General Dynamics, net grew to $71 million, or $1.70 ashare, from $68 million, or $1.63 a share. Sales slipped to$2.1 billion from $2.28 billion.   But what caught analysts' eyes at both companies was thebettering of their balance sheets. At McDonnell Douglas, debtdeclined to $2.69 billion from a March peak of $3.3 billion.Mr. Lanese said that by the end of the year, the numbershould fall as low as $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion.   For its part, General Dynamics keeps piling up cash andbuilding its backlog, which now represents three years ofsales. The company's cash balance at the end of the quarterwas $600 million. The more cash the company has &quot;the moreflexible we can be,&quot; said Jim Cunnane, chief financialofficer, adding, &quot;And flexibility is the key in thisenvironment.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
