The oil and gas exploration and production company, which put the unit on the block last month, had hoped to sell it by year's end so a purchaser could take advantage of the unit's $160 million federal income tax-loss carry-forward.    A spokesman said that because it couldn't close a sale by year's end, it would no longer try to sell the entire unit, but may still consider selling some of the unit's oil and gas properties. The unit holds about 13 million barrels of proven oil reserves and 65 billion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves.    Texas International wanted a bid that would let it pay off about $100 million in senior debt and have some operating cash left over. &quot;We didn't receive any acceptable bids that met what we felt the properties and the (tax) loss carry-forward was worth,&quot; the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
