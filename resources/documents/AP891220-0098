Kohl, during a news conference closing a triumphant two-dayvisit, also said he expects a treaty expanding East and West Germanties to be completed by May.   Kohl met with Communist Premier Hans Modrow on Tuesday, and thetwo later announced plans for the treaty and a number of otherchanges:   _The famed Brandenburg Gate, isolated in East Berlin since theBerlin Wall was built in 1961, will be reopened by Christmas.   _Germans will be allowed to travel without visas between the twostates beginning Christmas Eve.   _East Germany will free all political prisoners, with many to bereleased before Christmas.   Kohl pledged to take into account the concerns of other Europeancountries as the two German states, created after World War II,move closer together.   ``It's the most natural thing that Germans want to livetogether,'' Kohl said.   Kohl pledged to avoid ``destabilization,'' a reference to thepower vacuum in East Germany that has followed the virtual collapseof Communist Party control here since a popular revolution began inthe fall.   Kohl added: ``Fears based in the past are understandable, butthere is nothing to be feared from the future. It's absurd to talkabout a Fourth Reich.''   East German Communists and other opponents of reunification havesaid joining the two states could create a ``Fourth Reich,'' andhave reminded people of the atrocities of Nazi dictator AdolfHitler's Third Reich.   In meeting with several opposition groups, including New Forum,Democratic Awakening, and others, Kohl said he heard none of themvoice opposition to eventual reunification.   New Forum representative Arnold Vaatz told the official newsagency ADN he found ``broad agreement'' with Kohl and that hisgroup was ``thankful'' for the results of the summit.   Earlier today, Kohl met with the Roman Catholic bishops ofDresden and Berlin, Joachim Reinelt and Georg Sterzinsky.   Sterzinsky said he and Reinelt explained their views on futurecooperation with West Germany in the meeting with Kohl.   Sterzinsky said he expects West Germany to ``treat us as apartner and help with our renewal.'' He viewed the visit by Kohl, aconservative Christian Democrat, as ``entirely positive,'' theofficial news agency ADN reported.   West Germany's Bild newspaper quoted unidentified officials inDresden as saying Berlin's Brandenburg Gate will be open topedestrians Friday. The newspaper said its report would appear inThursday's editions. It was sent in advance to other news mediatoday.   The Brandenburg Gate is a symbol of German unity to millions andwas a centerpiece of a major Berlin thoroughfare before the wallwas built 28 years ago.   Under the pressure of massive pro-democracy demonstrationsstarting in October, openings have been made in the wall, two setsof Communist leaders have been ousted, and free elections arescheduled in May. At the same time, West Germany has warmlyaccepted all East German refugees and offered to help revive itsneighbor's struggling economy.   At a joint news conference after their summit, Kohl and Modrowsaid their talks had made progress toward what the two nationsrefer to as a ``treaty community.'' Such an arrangement wouldsafeguard the sovereignty of both states.   Talks leading up to the planned bilateral treaty could focus onimproving traffic connections, telecommunications and pollutionproblems, Kohl said.   Both leaders agreed to meet again in late January or earlyFebruary in West Germany.   While Kohl stressed the ``right of self-determination'' forcitizens in both Germany on the issue of reunification, Modrowcalled for the continued existence of two German states.   Kohl joined his host in counseling caution and patience.   Later, Kohl received an emotional welcome from a crowd of about20,000 at an outdoor evening rally.   People repeatedly burst into wild cheers, applause and chants of``Unity!'' ``Unity!'' as Kohl addressed them as his ``countrymen.''   Many waved West German flags, outnumbering those carrying signsinsisting on East German sovereignty or attacking Kohl.</TEXT></DOC>
