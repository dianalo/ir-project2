The reported rebuffs came as market analysts world-wide debated whether Mr. Holmes a Court will be forced into a &quot;fire sale&quot; of his multibillion-dollar assets to raise cash to service debt in coming months.    The stock price of Mr. Holmes a Court's two major listed companies -- Bell Group Ltd. and its 42.5%-owned unit, Bell Resources Ltd. -- has taken a beating in the recent world market plunge because of investor worries that Mr. Holmes a Court faces a cash squeeze.    In Sydney yesterday, Bell Group closed with a gain of 15 Australian cents (10 cents), at 2.10 Australian dollars ($1.44), which is 79% below its price before the Oct. 19 crash. Bell Resources closed 25 cents higher at 1.65 dollars a share, off 68% from its pre-crash level. The All Ordinaries index, the general indicator of the Australian market, has fallen about 40% from its close before Black Monday.    Talk of asset sales intensified late last week after Bell Group said it was selling 206 million dollars ($141.3 million) of commercial property in Perth's central business district to the state-owned insurance concern of Western Australia.    A senior executive of Bell Group said Bell Resources received four offers Friday for its Texaco shares, but none would have allowed the company to recoup its initial investment of an average $37.50 a share, or about $900 million. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Texaco shares closed with a gain of 37.5 cents, at $30.25.    The Bell Group executive said two of the offers came from U.S. interests that he called &quot;serious first-party buyers.&quot; The other offers came from intermediaries, such as U.S. investment bankers, he said.    Bell Group also rebuffed approaches from potential buyers of its 8% stake in the British retailer Sears PLC, the executive said (Sears PLC isn't related to Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. of the U.S.). And a source close to Bell Group said several media interests, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., the Australian publisher Kerry Packer and London-based Pearson PLC, have approached Bell about buying holdings it agreed to acquire recently from John Fairfax Ltd. The Fairfax interests include financial newspapers in Australia and New Zealand, which Bell has said it doesn't want to sell.    In London, a Pearson spokesman declined to comment on the reports. A News Corp. spokesman in New York also declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mr. Packer in Australia.    The Bell executive denied the necessity of asset sales. &quot;We have positive cash flow in Bell Group and Bell Resources,&quot; he said. &quot;And we can quite adequately&quot; service the obligations without dumping assets. But he added that if &quot;somebody makes a realistic offer, we'd have to consider it.&quot;    Indeed, Bell Group officials, including Mr. Holmes a Court -- known here as the Great Acquirer -- have gone out of their way in recent days to calm investors' fears, partly by talking to reporters. &quot;If they are desperate, they have made a point of creating an impression they aren't,&quot; said an international corporate adviser who watches Bell Group closely. &quot;They act like they are sitting pretty comfortably. On the face of it, it is hard to believe.&quot;    Mr. Holmes a Court is talking tough. In the just-released Bell Group annual report, he reassured shareholders that he is poised to pounce on companies in which Bell already holds an interest.    He and other Bell Group officials maintain they still have a war chest of about 10 billion dollars in bank credit lines, though several analysts who monitor the group doubt it can muster that much credit after the market crash. The bank lines were arranged several months ago, and Mr. Holmes a Court met his bankers recently to renew the agreements.    Bell Resources owns about 24 million Texaco shares, or slightly less than 10% of the U.S. oil company, and hasn't added to its stake in about three months. Mr. Holmes a Court has permission from U.S. securities regulators to buy as much as 15% of Texaco, and some analysts said his failure to buy up Texaco shares as their price has sagged indicates he is in a cash bind.    But a source close to the group said raising the Texaco stake beyond 10% isn't attractive because U.S. law would require that any profit from the subsequent sale of those shares be split with Texaco.    Analysts who follow Bell Group said Mr. Holmes a Court would be willing to sell Texaco shares, even at a loss, to raise cash to fund a takeover of another cash-producing company. Because Texaco is in bankruptcy proceedings, it can't pay dividends to shareholders, which means Bell Resources isn't getting any return on its investment.    The Australian stock market is rife with rumors that Mr. Holmes a Court will make an offer for Broken Hill Proprietary Co., a resources and steelmaking concern that is Australia's biggest company in terms of market capitalization.    Bell Resources already owns about 30% of BHP, and under a so-called peace agreement Mr. Holmes a Court signed with BHP, Bell can't acquire significant blocks of stock without mounting a full takeover of the company.    Some analysts doubt Mr. Holmes a Court would pay the eight billion dollars needed to buy the BHP shares he doesn't already own, which would increase his debt burden considerably. One option, analysts said, is to structure an offer with a partner. There also is market talk of BHP buying Bell Resources to rid itself of Mr. Holmes a Court's interest. </TEXT></DOC>
