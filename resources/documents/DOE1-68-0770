<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-68-0770 </DOCNO><TEXT>An experimental solar-assisted heat pump system with a hybrid ground-coupledstorage at the F.U.L. in Arlon, Belgium, is described. It includes a382 m{sup 2} solar roof, two types of water storages, heat storage inearth by horizontal exchangers, and heat pumps. One operating period(1984-1985) is analyzed. The data processed has shown that each of thesubsystems has apparently performed adequately: annual collector efficiencyis 0.41, heat pump C.O.P. range around 4. Despite important energy lossesfrom the underground storage, the storage efficiency reaches 0.7. Thiseffectiveness is mainly due to heat recovery below natural soil temperatureand also to the use of buried tanks for short-term storage. The maindifficulties are controlling the flow between these subsystems and developingan operating strategy that matches both the building's heat requirementsand a good solar fraction.</TEXT></DOC>
