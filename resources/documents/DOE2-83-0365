The generationof stellar shells produced by the interaction between a parent and alight disk galaxy is examined. The simulation is a restricted three-bodycalculation using 2000 particles. Dissipationless and dissipative dynamicalmodels were used. In the dissipationless case, the effect of orbitaleccentricity and the ellipticity of the parent potential are separated.In the dissipative case, the parent galaxy is assumed a rotationallysupported elliptical or SO, various parameters are investigated for theireffects on shell production: dynamical friction, parent mass and rotation,companion mass, orbit, core size, disk velocity dispersion and spin orientation.B. Ring Galaxies. The generation of ring galaxies produced by the galaxy-galaxycollision is investigated. The simulation is an N-body approach using52,000 particles. The target system is a realistic disk with a live halo,the intruder is of a rigid Plummer potential and moves along a rectilinearorbit with constant velocity. Sixteen experiments were performed: differentorientations and impact parameters of the trajectory of the intruderare considered.</TEXT></DOC>
