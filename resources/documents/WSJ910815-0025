They command princely prices frominvestors, who have bid up the shares to trade at 40 to 64times reported earnings.   But before you join the crowd that worships these stocks,consider what happened to the stock market aristocrats ofyesteryear. Many of them got beheaded.</LP><TEXT>   The accompanying table shows what became of the mostcelebrated stocks of five years ago, 10 years ago andDecember 1972, when Kidder Peabody first started keepingtrack of market favorites. The table, a snapshot of thepinnacle of Kidder's &quot;Top 50&quot; list, shows the New York StockExchange companies with the very highest P-E ratios, that is,the stocks that were trading at the highest multiples ofpershare earnings.   These old lists are full of names that once seemedinvinciblev -- names such as Polaroid, McDonald's and WaltDisney. Many are fine companies, but most have disappointedinvestors. That's because investors' expectations were sohigh, it would have taken a superhuman performance to live upto them.   The same fate may await stocks such as Wal-Mart, U.S.Surgical and Home Depot. You don't hear the term &quot;glamourstocks&quot; much any more, but that's exactly what these are. Thecompanies are fastgrowing and extremely successful. Thestocks are well known, widely owned by institutions andindividuals. And they are high-priced in relation to recentearnings.   So skillfully do these companies manage their businessesthat it's hard to see what could possibly go wrong. But itwas hard, years ago, to imagine how Polaroid, McDonald's orWalt Disney could falter.   Of the 10 stocks leading the Kidder high-multiple list atthe end of 1972, only one -- Automatic Data Processing -- hasoutperformed the market in the 18 1/2 years since.   Topping that list back in 1972 was Polaroid, which sold at90 times earnings to investors who revered itsquick-developing photo technology. Polaroid stock hasactually lost money for investors who have held it the full18 1/2 years through Julydeclining 35.9%.   Also prominent on the 1972 list was McDonald's, priced at83 times earnings as investors saw no limit to the billionsof hamburgers it could feed the world. The subsequent returnon McDonald's stock, 418%, was far below the Sandamp;P's 625%.   International Business Machines ranked 11th back then, at37 times earnings. It has provided buy-and-hold investorswith only one quarter the return of the Sandamp;P.   Fans of growth-stock investing reply that price/earningsmultiples back in 1972 were among the highest ever. Trueenough. But the most popular stocks of mid-1981, whosemultiples were less exorbitant -- 23 to 45 times earnings --fared even worse. All 10 underperformed the market averages.   Fans of glamour stocks can take more comfort from the 1986list. Six of the top 10 stocks in 1986 have beaten the Sandamp;P,by Kidder's tally. The biggest gainers are two retailers thatremain popular today, namely Wal-Mart and Toys `R' Us. Bothrose over 300%.   If buying and holding glamour stocks isn't a goodstrategy, what about trading them briskly? Each month, Kidderpublishes an estimate of what would happen to an investor whobought the Top 50 each month, discarding any stock that felloff that select list. For the past two years, the strategyhas worked great, with price appreciation of 25%, versus 12%for the Sandamp;P. Long-term, it's a virtual tie with the Sandamp;P.   But that's assuming it costs nothing to trade. Stayingwith the hot stocks would probably require 20 to 60 trades ayear, making the hot-stock strategy trail the marketaverages.   Ralph Wanger, president of Acorn Fund in Chicago, says heavoids glamour stocks. &quot;It's not hard to find people whoremember when IBM was a hot growth stock,&quot; he says. &quot;SearsRoebuck was a hot growth stock. Xerox, Digital Equipment,Burroughs. . . .Wall Street people tend to overestimategrowth rates.&quot;   Not even fast-growing Wal-Mart, the nation's largestretailer with $40 billion in annual sales, tempts Mr. Wanger.&quot;I calculated at one point that in a dozen years, Wal-Martwould be doing all the retail sales in the United States,&quot; hesays, tongue firmly in cheek. &quot;So far, Wal-Mart's on course.But once they do become the sole retailer in the U.S., theirgrowth rate will have to drop.&quot;   Chris Bertelsen, who runs the Colonial Fund in Boston,utters the unthinkable: &quot;I'm tempted to short Wal-Mart. Theirgrowth rates have become almost unsustainable. They've donejust about all they can in Spearfish, South Dakota.&quot;   Once Wal-Mart has to fight it out with other retailers inmore populated areas, Mr. Bertelsen asserts, profit marginsand growth will have to decline. Also, Wal-Mart reminds himof Sears Roebuck in the 1950s or Kmart in the 1970s.Investors thought they saw &quot;unlimited growth. Well, it didn'tturn out that way.&quot;   The road to profits is &quot;to buy growth at a discount,&quot; saysTerence McLaughlin, a portfolio manager at Ashland Managementin New York. By that standard, he says, Home Depot and U.S.Surgical are too expensive. As for Wal-Mart: &quot;We still ownthat, but that could become a source of funds. We're notmarried to any company.&quot;   David Katz of Matrix Asset Advisors says U.S. Surgical,Wal-Mart and Home Depot are expensive not only compared withother stocks, but to their own historic norms. &quot;Any one ofthem could be down 30% to 40% if it merely fell back to itsown average valuation level for the period 1985-1991,&quot; hesays.   Growth-stock managers, by the legion, feel differently, ofcourse. &quot;People have been saying that those stocks are tooexpensive for two or three years now,&quot; says Lanny Sachnowitz,associate manager of AIM Charter Fund. &quot;If you weren'tinvested in them, you have missed big moves.&quot;   Everyone is convinced that his favorite high-P-E growthstock will defy the odds. And in any single case, thebeliever may be right. James Craig of Janus Fund says HomeDepot &quot;can grow 30% to 35% a year for many years to come.&quot;Every bit of news we get is that its competition is closingdown.&quot; Roger Engemann, a money manager in Pasadena, Calif.,has held Wal-Mart for many years, and says he would buy moreon dips. &quot;No matter what price you paid for a company, if theearnings growth really came through for you, you made a lotof money,&quot; he says.   Several managers, including Stephen D. Cutler, presidentof Essex Investment Management in Boston, say high P-Es arefine just so long as the earnings growth is higher than theP-E.   And Patricia Chadwick of Chancellor Capital Managementargues that investors in market-favorite stocks can protectthemselves by getting out in time -- not waiting for earningsto decline, but selling when earnings growth slows.   Kenneth Heebner, portfolio manager at Capital GrowthManagement in Boston, agrees. &quot;Managements will tell you, `Ohthese horrible investors, one slip in a quarter and out theygo.' Well, I think it's smart to go out. Usually {a quarterlydownturn} is the first sign of a change.&quot;   Mr. Heebner says he doesn't shy away from expensivestocks. &quot;My favorite stock {is one that} has already doubledin three months,&quot; he says. &quot;You tell me a stock is up threepoints in a day and I'm interested.&quot; Still, he generallyprefers stocks that aren't high-priced institutionalfavorites. One he likes is International Game Technology, aleading maker of slot machines. He counts on increasedgambling in Australia and on the Mississippi River, plusvideo lottery games for state governments. &quot;State governmentsare drooling for revenue,&quot; he says.   Mr. Heebner's conclusion: &quot;What Wall Street thinks aregrowth stocks are not necessarily what the growth companiesare.&quot;   ---            Where Are the Stars of Yesteryear?                                                                                                          Investing in most popular stocks is a dangerous game --witness what happened to many past market favorites.
