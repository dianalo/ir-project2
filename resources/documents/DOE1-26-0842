Interpretation ofthe seismic data is normally made by geophysicists to define subsurfacestructure. However, considerable information of great value to the drillingengineer is also contained in the seismic information. This paper discusseshow the drilling engineer can use these data to estimate depth and magnitudeof subsurface formation pressures, predict gross changes in lithology,and warn of possible drilling problems. Techniques are also presentedfor predicting relative drillability and fracture gradients in rank wildcatareas. The predictive techniques described have been used with good resultsover a wide area along the Texas Gulf Coast including Continental Shelflocations and might possibly be applicable to any sedimentary basin.</TEXT></DOC>
