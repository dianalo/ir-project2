The front door. She's here!;    &quot;Hi, Dad! I decided not to goafter all. I'm going to spend the weekend with you!&quot;;    &quot;Bill! It's you, heybuddy, great! Wonderful! Not going after all, eh? Hey, that's great! Soooooo,y'hungry?&quot;;    Bill, your beloved teen-age son, has decided not to go to Mom'safter all. He's going to spend the weekend with you! And, yep, he's hungry.;   What a precious child. And to think, some people don't even want kids.;   Frame 2: You've become Very Close Friends now. Bill Jr. is away and yourteen-age daughter has gone to a long-awaited party. She won't be in until atleast 1 a.m.;    You and your Very Close Friend enjoy a quiet dinner, somewine, a movie, some more wine, some furtive glances.;    Well, shoot, you'retwo consenting, over-40 adults. Just sitting there. Alone. Taking two at atime, you are able to clear the stairs in approximately five-eighths of asecond.;    The only telltale sign as you close the bedroom door is a pair ofwomen's shoes parked discreetly under the living room coffee table.;    What'sthat? The front door. She's here?!;    But it's only 11 o'clock!;    Nyeh, theparty was lousy: She decided to come home early; she picked up a couple ofmovies on the way home. Thinks she'll just settle in with the VCR. In theliving room. Next to the shoes.;    Such are the tales of single parenthood inthe '90s.;    Normal, full-grown, consenting, responsible, caring, nurturingparents are finding it increasingly difficult these days to have a normal,full-grown, consenting, responsible, caring, nurturing relationship withanother adult of the same inclination.;    Putting aside arguments aboutwhether one ought to have such a relationship -- out of wedlock and all that-- how in the world does one do it?;    Millions want to know.;    &quot;Let's justsay there's something unappealing about the back seat of a car when you're 43years old,&quot; says Bill Sr.;    The single-parent generation, alas, is coming ofage. Which means that their children, also having come of age, are old enoughto figure out what's going on.;    The cold truth is, a teen-ager's radar forparental goings-on is only slightly less sophisticated than a Patriotmissile's.;    Give a teen-ager the car, an American Express credit card andthe key to the front door, and he'll be home in time for Arsenio if he knowsyou've got a date. He just loves Arsenio.;    It's not intentional sabotage,you understand. He doesn't know exactly why he's coming home. He just knowsinstinctively that whatever's going on at home is far more interesting thanwhatever's going on wherever he is.;    And he is your kid. And this is hishome!;    You can't very well say, &quot;No, Bill, you can't stay here this weekendbecause, well, I was planning to commit some crimes against nature in thisvery household. So why don't you just take the car and play a little chickenwith some of your friends?&quot;;    Of course you don't mean that! No. So, youlump it, take a cold shower, and begin careful reconsideration of yourdecision not to send your child to boarding school.;    The fact is, it's mucheasier for teen-agers to enjoy intimacy these days than it is for adults.;   For one thing, teen-agers have no objection to back seats. Back seats are toteen-agers what couches are to Labrador retrievers. Irresistible.;    On theother hand, teen-agers don't have to resort to back seats. While America'ssweet, loving, bovine parents are out working all afternoon, teen-agers --who, incidentally, get out of school at 3 o'clock -- are at home playinghouse.;    If we were truly serious about halting teen-age pregnancy, we'dinsist on a national policy to either end the workday at 3 p.m. or extend theschool day until 5 p.m.;    Better yet, why not do both? Teen-agers wouldn'tbe at home alone without parental supervision, and parents would be at homewithout teen-age intervention.;    Think of the savings on boarding-schoolfees. And don't forget. . . .
