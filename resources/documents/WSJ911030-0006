Rumors of an easing started coursing through bond marketsMonday after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S.economy is &quot;having significant difficulty bouncing back fromthe recession.&quot; They were bolstered yesterday morning by aspate of data confirming Mr. Greenspan's suspicions of a weakrecovery.</LP><TEXT>   First, the Commerce Department said U.S. gross nationalproduct grew at a 2.4% annual rate between July andSeptember.   Although the number -- which is subject to revision --seemed to end a string of three quarters of declining GNP,market participants saw signs of continuing economic softnessin the report, particularly in its weak inflation data.Prices as measured by the GNP-based implicit price deflatorrose at a 1.8% annual rate in the third quarter, down from a4.5% annual rate in the second quarter.   Adding to the pessimistic economic outlook was yesterday'sannouncement of a stronger-than-expected drop in theConference Board's consumer confidence index. The ConferenceBoard, a business research organization, said the index fell12.5 points to 60.4 in October, a level last seen when theU.S. economy was in recession earlier in the year.   &quot;Consumer confidence was a shock number,&quot; said LeonardSantow, a managing director at Griggs andamp; Santow Inc., aneconomic and financial advisory firm.   The poor economic data suggested that the Fed again hasroom to cut short-term interest rates to try to stimulate theeconomy -- a move that would boost prices of bonds with shortmaturities. But prices of bonds with long maturities rose themost yesterday, spurred by the weak inflation data.   The bellwether 30-year U.S. Treasury bond ended up nearly1 5/8 points -- or nearly $16.25 for a bond with a $1,000face amount -- to yield 7.89%. By contrast, the two-yearTreasury note auctioned last week gained only 1/4 point toyield 5.749% in late trading.   Traders said some big money managers sold five-yearTreasury notes and bought bonds yesterday, reflecting adesire to take profits on the shorter maturities, whereyields have declined already. Such moves also point toexpectations that yields now will make relatively biggerdrops in the longer maturities. Bond yields move in theopposite direction from bond prices.   Meanwhile, bond market participants probably will revive adebate on monetary policy that seemed all but dead two weeksago. Many of them agree that Mr. Greenspan is under pressureto cut short-term rates before the auction of three-year,10-year and 30-year U.S. securities scheduled for next week.But how, exactly, will he make the move?   One trader suggests that investors are betting on a&quot;series of eases&quot; in the federal funds rate -- the rate thatbanks charge one another for overnight loans. Mr. Santow, onthe other hand, argues that the Fed will want to send astrong easing message by cutting both the federal funds rateand the discount rate -- the rate the Fed charges banks -- inquick succession.   The current federal funds rate target is 5.25%. Thediscount rate is currently 5%.   But James Somers, president of Somers Asset Management inRadnor, Pa., continues to believe in last week's conventionalwisdom: that only one more easing is in the works.   &quot;I still think that we've reached the edge of monetarypolicy,&quot; he says, explaining that as short-term interestrates fall, so does the income of consumers who hold cash inmoney market funds. &quot;You reach the point where the ease canhave negative effects in the economy. Other people havechanged their minds about that, and I think they're deadwrong.&quot;   Many traders expect to see some sign of the Fed'sintentions as soon as Friday, when the October employmentstatistics will be released.   Meanwhile, attention will be focussed on today'sannouncement of the details of next week's quarterly Treasuryauction. The Treasury is expected to sell around $38 billionof three-year, 10-year and 30-year securities.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          The Treasury's 30-year bond finished at 102 18/32, up 119/32 points from late Monday in New York, to yield 7.89%.   The 10-year note finished the session at 102 8/32, up 12/32, to yield 7.48%.   The when-issued five-year note finished the day at 10011/32, up 17/32, to yield 6.78%, and the when-issued two-yearnote was at 100 13/32, up 7/32, yielding 5.77%.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Corporations issued $500 million of new bonds and notesyesterday as lower interest rates spurred a number ofcompanies to sell debt.   The increase in borrowing came as investment-gradecorporate bonds rallied sharply, buoyed by strong gains inthe Treasury market. Prices of long-term corporate bondsadvanced as much as 1 1/4 points, while intermediate-termbonds added 5/8 point.   PepsiCo Inc., the Purchase, N.Y., soft drink and snackfood maker, was the biggest issuer, offering $300 million ofseven-year notes to yield 7.67%.   Also in the market was Oryx Energy Co., a Dallas oil andgas company. Oryx sold $100 million of eight-year notespriced to yield 9.60% through underwriters led by FirstBoston Corp. While the Oryx issue carried a junk bond ratingof Ba-2 from Moody's Investors Service Inc., it was ratedtriple-B-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., which is thatconcern's lowest investment-grade bond rating.   In the high-yield market, junk bonds, or speculative-gradesecurities with low credit ratings or no credit ratings atall, inched higher, registering gains of between 1/8 and 1/4point.   Among high-yield bonds that advanced were bonds ofChrysler Corp., which rose on news that Mitsubishi MotorsCorp. has bought Chrysler's 50% stake in Diamond-Star Motors.The sale ends months of speculation about Mitsubishi'sintention to assume control of the U.S. plant it has operatedjointly with Chrysler since 1985.   Chrysler's Auburn Hills Trust certificates ended at a bidprice of 80 1/2, up about 5/8 point.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          California may face a tough sell when it comes to markettoday with its offering of $441 million of general obligationbonds, dealers said yesterday.   The state's economic slump continues, evidenced by a $344million first-quarter revenue shortfall in the budget andlarger-than-expected job losses.   That coupled with record general obligation debt issuancethis year could limit interest in the state's bonds,especially among institutional investors, traders andportfolio managers said. With today's planned offering,long-term general obligation bond issuance will total $4billion this year, compared with $3.02 billion in 1990.   Price talk circulating late yesterday put the top yield onthe California issue in the 6.40% to 6.50% range for bondsmaturing in 2011. Top-quality triple-A-rated generalobligation bonds are now yielding about 6.35%, dealers said.   Although a top yield around 6.50% would still fall in thetriple-A range, that level would signal that California'sstatus among issuers has declined, dealers said.   California general obligation bonds are rated triple-A byboth Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor'sCorp. Yesterday, both concerns confirmed their rating on thebonds.   Meanwhile, most actively traded municipals finished 1/8 toabout 1/2 point higher.   Among seasoned names, New York City Municipal WaterFinance Authority's 7% issues of 2015 finished 1/2 pointhigher at 99 1/8 to yield 7.05%.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Prices of mortgage securities rose on yesterday's economicand inflation news.   While 8% mortgage securities jumped by 18/32, theTreasury's 10-year note was up 31/32 late in the session.Consequently, yield spreads between the two markets widenedby as much as 0.04 percentage point.   The 8% securities of the Government National MortgageAssociation, the Federal National Mortgage Association andthe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. were yielding 0.72 to0.81 percentage point more than the 10-year Treasury note's7.50%. Late Monday, the yield margins were quoted at 0.68 to0.79 percentage point.   Although yield spreads widened, they remain relativelynarrow. Just two weeks ago, yields on 8% mortgage securitieswere 0.78 to 0.92 percentage point above Treasurys.   There continues to be bidding for mortgage securities tobe used as collateral for real estate mortgage investmentconduit deals, and that demand should keep spreads fromwidening much further in the near term, traders say.   In secondary market dealings, Ginnie Mae 8% issues forNovember delivery were up 18/32 at 99, Freddie Mac Gold 8%issues were 18/32 higher at 98 22/32, and Fannie Mae 8%s wereup 18/32 at 98 17/ 32.</TEXT></DOC>
