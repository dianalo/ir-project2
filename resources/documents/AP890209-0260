(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eastman Kodak Co. said Thursday it wantsto cut its non-essential costs by 15 percent and may do so bytrimming its work force, selling businesses or ending product lines.   ``I think it would be inaccurate to call this a job reductionplan,'' said Kodak spokesman Paul Allen. ``We're asking unitmanagers to start looking very closely at their businesses and startmaking some decisions from the viewpoint of profitability.''   Allen said costs directly related to raw materials and productionwon't be subject to the cutbacks, but that all of the company'sproducts and business units will be reviewed to determine whetherthey're worth keeping.   ``Over the last eight years Kodak has made a lot of strategicacquisitions,'' Allen said. ``What we haven't done is a lot ofstrategic divestment.''   The announcement came a day after Kodak reported record sales andearnings in 1988.   Kodak's 1988 profit rose 19 percent to a record $1.4 billion, or$4.31 a share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $3.52 a share, in1987. Sales rose 28 percent to a record $17.03 billion, up from$13.3 billion in 1987.   The results were boosted by the contribution of Sterling DrugCo., which Kodak acquired in February 1988.   Allen said the comprehensive look at the company is part of thechanges that have taken place at Kodak since the company began amassive reorganization in 1984.   In a presentation to employees Wednesday, part of an ongoingseries, Chairman Colby Chandler outlined the study but didn't saywhich businesses, products or employees would be affected.   Stock analysts said that even the company may not know for sure.   ``It could include some of the things in the electronics area, oroffice equipment, or batteries,'' said Peter Enderlin, an analystwith Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York. ``It doesn't haveto be businesses in trouble. Some of the joint ventures they haveare still very small and may have a lot of potential but aren'tworth the trouble to Kodak.''</TEXT></DOC>
