Decay of macroradicals wasobserved as a function of the concentration of ethylene glycol dimethyacrylateused as a crosslinking agent by the ESR method. The rate constants forfree radical decay were found to decrease with the increasing contentof the the crosslinking agent. The overall activation energies determinedfrom the temperature variations of the rate constants were reduced withthe increasing amount of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate in the copolymersystem. The results are discussed from the point of view of molecularmotions dominating in the temperature interval examined and controllingthe decay process in crosslinked poly(methyl methacrylate).</TEXT></DOC>
