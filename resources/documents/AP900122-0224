Thelast time he lost.   That was more than 40 years ago when the Communists crushed hisSocial Democratic Party and sent him off to a labor camp and prisonfor 10 years.   The Communists still hold an upper hand in Bulgaria but in onerespect the tables have turned for Dertliev: Todor Zhivkov,Bulgaria's longtime Communist Party leader, is under house arreston charges of incitement of ethnic hostility, misuse of stateproperty and malfeasance in office.   After Zhivkov's ouster Nov. 10, Dertliev, now 73, wasted no timecalling a dozen former mates of the dark Stalinist days inconfinement and reactivating his party, which the Communists,through an unexplained oversight, simply forgot to ban and now wasstill legal.   Membership is already 30,000 nationwide _ 10,000 in this capital_ and Dertliev has a seat at round table talks where 12 oppositiongroups negotiate with the Communists for more democracy.   But Dertliev, like many Bulgarians, is skeptical that theCommunists really want to relinquish the power they acquired byruthless repression after World War II.   ``We should not fall into the illusion that they will collapseimmediately, even though they are demoralized,'' the trim, retiredphysician said in an interview. ``The advantages of having realpower are keeping them on their toes.''   Unlike their comrades elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria'sCommunists appear confident they can hold on to a good share ofpower after free elections, which they promise for May but thestill weak opposition wants held off until November.   Petar Mladenov, the longtime foreign minister who took over aspresident and party chief from Zhivkov, has not cut a high publicprofile since losing his temper before an angry crowd of oppositionbackers outside Parliament in December.   But his No. 2 man, Andrey Lukanov, is a skilled politicaloperator and third generation Communist who speaks six foreignlanguages and was born and educated in Moscow. Lukanov, who headsthe Communist team at the round table, has exuded confidence thathis party could win a majority in the elections.   Dertliev thinks the Communists would get 25 percent to 30percent of the vote if elections were held now, while some Westerndiplomats believe they are just as unpopular as those elsewhere inEastern Europe and would fail miserably at the ballot box.   The Communists are trying hard, however. They have so farrefused to relinquish their control over newspapers, television andradio, while promising the opposition a daily publication, althoughlimiting its circulation to one-tenth that of their own newspapers.   Lukanov has encouraged the formation of liberal, almost socialdemocratic factions inside the Communist Party, apparently hopingthese will attract people who might otherwise join Dertliev's partyor another opposition group.   Dertliev and other activists say they have found, on more thanone occasion, that the well-informed Communists skillfullypreempted opposition victories by simply making opposition demandstheir own platform.   Recalling one case, he said, ``We decided in the morning to callfor the resignations of certain ministers.'' By afternoon, headded, the Communist Party announced the ministers were fired.   To some outside the party, such tactics could indicate thedivided Communists are following, rather than directing, the driftof Bulgaria's politics, at least at this stage.   Dertliev notes, however, that the Bulgarian Communist Party,which predates even the Soviet Communist Party, has strongtraditions that go back to the last century and was awell-organized underground body during Fascist rule in World War II.   Today the Communists number about 900,000, or 10 percent of thetotal population, but they have formally relinquished theirguaranteed leading role.   The words ``socialism'' and ``communism,'' however, still appearthroughout the Bulgarian constitution, an intricate 1971 documentthat outlines strict state controls over everything from foreigntrade to authors' copyrights; it even gives a minute descriptionmandating the appearance of the national emblem.   Dertliev thus sees his fight as one of the still-weak (theSocial Democrats) against the still-strong (the Communists).   ``The Communists have at their disposal all the machinery,'' hesaid. ``What we have is the good will of the people on our side.''   Mindful of the repression that wiped out the popular SocialDemocratic Party and one anti-Communist faction of the BulgarianAgrarian Union in the 1940s, Dertliev and other opposition figuresnow seek legal guarantees that one-party rule will not return.   The repression descended on Bulgaria with terrifying force afterWorld War II, with party leader Georgi Dmitrov ruthlessly doingaway with opponents before his death in 1949.   Some of his victims now are being rehabilitated. But it remainstaboo to link the repression directly to Dmitrov, whose embalmedbody lies, as Lenin's does in Moscow, in a mausoleum where theCommunists hold parades on May Day and other important days.   In 1946, Dertliev was 30 years old and one of the 101 SocialDemocrats sitting in a 400-member Parliament.   He recalled the repression.   ``Massive persecution'' and rigging elections were already underway by 1945-46, he said. ``The terror then continued andincreased,'' with the arrest of Social Democrat Krastyo Pastuhovand other party leaders.   Pastuhov ``was sentenced for five years for just two (written)articles,'' Dertliev said. While in prison, he was strangled by acellmate.   Sveta Ivanov, sent to a labor camp for writing just one articleurging Bulgaria not to sever all its ties with the West, wasanother who died. So did Lyudmila Slavova, who was reported to havecommitted suicide while awaiting trial in 1947, the year otherleading Social Democrats were sentenced to terms of 15, 12 and 10years.   Dertliev got 10 years.   ``My wife was 21, and my baby 4 months,'' Dertliev recalled witha smile tinged with bitterness. ``When I came back, she was alreadyin the third class at school.''   Although the Social Democratic Party was not formally banned _Dertliev says this was because ``the Communists thought they wouldstay in power forever'' _ he and others knew it was impossible toreturn to politics.   Dertliev worked for eight years in the obscurity of a sanatoriumfor tubercular children in the mountains of central Bulgaria.   Little by little, he made his way back to Sofia where hemaintained quiet contacts with old cellmates.   Now, brimming with humor and energy, he wants to build ademocratic Bulgaria, but is sanguine about the chances of outsidesupport and internal willingness to restore the nation's shatteredeconomy and morale.   Bulgaria has fewer friends abroad than other East Europeannations, he said, and it alienated the West through Zhivkov'scampaign to assimilate its ethnic Turkish minority.   ``We have no false hopes that very soon we will be able tochange everything,'' Dertliev said. ``For most people, their owninitiative is dead. ... They wait for somebody to command them.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Jan. 28</NOTE></DOC>
