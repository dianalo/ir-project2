LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir does not intendto alter his Palestinian peace plan despite pressure from theUnited States, Egypt and the rival Labor Party, his aides saidMonday.   ``Only five months have passed'' since Shamir presented his planfor elections as a first step toward negotiations and ``the primeminister does not see any reason to change it,'' spokesman YossiAhimeir said.   Egyptian, Israeli and U.S. officials have been meeting in NewYork and Israel's governing coalition _ Shamir's rightist Likudbloc and the center-left Labor Party _ is preparing to debateMubarak's efforts to bring Palestinians and Israelis together inpreliminary talks.   At the United Nations in New York, Foreign Minister Marwan Kasimof Jordan urged the United States, Soviet Union and others topersuade Israel to talk with the Palestine Liberation Organizationand move ``out of the circle of violence and oppression ... into astate of security, stability and constructiveness.''   The Cabinet leadership, including Likud and Labor ministers, isto meet Thursday about Mubarak's ideas.   Likud rejects a formula backed by Egypt and the United Statesthat involves trading occupied land for peace and including peopledeported by Israel in a Palestinian negotiating delegation. Labor,led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, supports both ideas.   Shamir's proposed elections would choose delegates to negotiatewith Israel about interim autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war.   Mubarak raised the land-for-peace proposal after manyPalestinians dismissed Shamir's plan as an effort to end theuprising against Israeli occupation that began Dec. 8, 1987.   At Tammun village in the West Bank, Mahmud Hamed Bani Awde, 22,was stabbed to death Monday for reasons not immediately clear.   The Israeli army said the killing was a family matter and wasunder police investigation, but the national news agency Itim andArab reporters said Awde belonged to the Democratic Front for theLiberation of Palestine, a Marxist group, and the murder may havebeen political.   In the Gaza Strip, a soldier was slightly injured Monday by arock thrown by Palestinians in the Jabaliya refugee camp, the armysaid.   Elsewhere in the occupied lands, Arab hospital officialsreported 11 Palestinians wounded by army gunfire, including a15-year-old boy hospitalized in Israel with a critical head wound.   Shops in Nablus and Bethlehem closed Monday to protest theshooting deaths of two Palestinians youths the previous day, Arabreports said.   Israeli soldiers or civilians have killed at least 581Palestinians in the uprising, and 123 Palestinians have been slainby fellow Arabs, most as suspected collaborators with Israel. FortyIsraelis have died in the violence.   Mubarak telephoned Shamir on Friday to talk about his proposals.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III issued a veiled threat todrop support for the election plan unless Israel moved toward theproposals made by Egypt, the only Arab country to have made peacewith Egypt.   Baker said last week the United States would ``have to go backto the drawing board'' on plans for Middle East peace if Israelrejected Mubarak's ideas.   Avi Pazner, another Shamir aide, said Israel did not see Baker'scomment as a threat but added that the government would not bow toU.S. pressure.   ``Everybody knows you can't twist Israel's arm when you want toget something,'' he told The Associated Press in a telephoneinterview.   Yossi Ben-Aharon, director of Shamir's office, said includingdeported Palestinians in a negotiating team was a ploy to sneak thePalestine Liberation Organization, which Israel defines as aterrorist group, into the peace process.   Peres, the Labor Party leader, noted that Mubarak did notmention two Arab demands Israel has found most objectionable: adirect role for the PLO and creation of a Palestinian state.   He criticized what he called Shamir's effort to create ``a newPalestinian people'' who agreed with Israel on all points.   ``The opinions of the Palestinians, the sentiments of thePalestinians ... must be known not only by every Israeli, but toevery Israeli politician,'' he said on television. ``We mustnegotiate with people who do not agree with us.''</TEXT></DOC>
