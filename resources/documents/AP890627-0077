Negotiations between the premier's Panhellenic Socialist Movementand the communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress ended atnoon without an agreement.   Papandreou was forced to appoint a representative to negotiate onhis behalf.   The 70-year-old premier was admitted to General State Hospital onThursday with pneumonia he contracted eight months after undergoingheart surgery. Hospital officials said he developed heart and kidneycomplications Sunday and was on a dialysis machine for three hours.   A medical bulletin issued by his doctors today said he was``continually improving.''   Papandreou is heading a caretaker government because no partyreceived a majority in elections on June 18 to the 300-seatParliament.   Communist Party leader Harilaos Florakis said Tuesday that thesocialist proposals ``were equally interesting'' as those made tohim last week by the conservatives, who finished first in theelections but failed to build a coalition.   Florakis did not disclose the proposals. The conservative NewDemocracy Party had proposed a government in which the leftistswould control the justice and interior ministries.   Florakis said that he would hold meetings with conservative andsocialist representatives on Wednesday, when his alliance beginsattempts to build a coalition government.   It appeared that the Coalition had little chance of leading analliance with either the support of the Socialists or theconservatives.   If the three major parties cannot form a coalition government,new elections will be called.</TEXT></DOC>
