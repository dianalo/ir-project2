Basing on these specificfindings, nosebleeding, and a positive family anamnesis, the findingscould be classified as belonging to manifestations of Osler's disease(hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia). This rare disease is characterisedby a triad of signs: telangiectasias, recurring bleeding, and heredity.In this article the specific MR image is compared with the CT patternand the results are discussed against the background of literature onOsler's disease which is also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber disease.</TEXT></DOC>
