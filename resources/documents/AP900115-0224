SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>COMPTON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ralphs Grocery Co. has avoided thefinancial woes gnawing at Campeau Corp.'s other U.S. companies,Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., Ralphs'chief said Monday.   ``It's business as usual,'' Chairman and Chief Executive ByronAllumbaugh said after Allied and Federated sought protection fromtheir creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law.   ``Nothing has occurred that will in any way change or alter theway Ralphs does business,'' Allumbaugh said.   Ralphs, with 142 stores, is the third largest supermarket chainin Southern California.   Toronto-based Campeau, the huge retailer burdened with billionsof dollars of debts, acquired Ralphs as part of its 1988 takeoverof Federated.   But Ralphs became an independent corporation under the Campeauumbrella in July 1988, and is unaffected by the bankruptcy filings.   ``We are a separate corporation from Federated, with our owndebt, our own bank financing,'' Allumbaugh said. ``Ralphs needs nofunds from Campeau and the Campeau Corp. is prohibited fromremoving any funds from Ralphs.''   Most Ralphs customers are unaware the company is part ofCampeau, and Ralphs has no immediate plan to advertise to reassurethem, he said.   As part of the spinoff from Federated, Ralphs management boughta stake in Ralphs by paying Federated $1.02 billion, which themanagers borrowed. The cost of paying down that debt has keptRalphs in the red, a circumstance expected as part of the deal.   But analysts say the grocery chain has had no problems payinginterest on the nearly $1 billion debt that remains whileremodeling and adding stores as needed.   For example, Ralphs had $40 million on hand to pay the $11.3million in debt due at the end of this month, said Andrew Leinoff,an analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei in Montpelier, Vt.   When rumors of the impending Allied and Federated filings begancirculating last week, Allumbaugh and Ralphs bankers and financialstrategists met with suppliers to reassure them of the grocerychain's solvency.   Allumbaugh told the suppliers that Ralphs has been able to cutits net losses from $72.6 million in fiscal 1988 to about $31million in fiscal 1989, which ends Jan. 28.   The company projects a net loss of $7 million in the comingyear, followed by a $17 million profit in fiscal 1991, he said.   ``For the year ending this month, we had an operating cash flowof $189 million, and the cash interest on our debt is about $130million. So we have about $59 million of free cash flow to reinvestin our business,'' Allumbaugh said.   For Ralphs customers, the Allied and Federated bankruptcyfilings are a ``non-event,'' Allumbaugh said.</TEXT></DOC>
