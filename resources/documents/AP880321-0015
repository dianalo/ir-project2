The push is being led by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who isthe chief sponsor of a 19-word resolution that he hopes will becomethe 27th amendment to the U.S. Constitution.   Hollings is proposing the amendment as an alternative tolegislation that was stymied by a 53-hour Republican filibusterlate last month.   The amendment seeks to overcome a Supreme Court ruling _ Buckleyvs. Valeo in 1976 _ that says congressionally mandated spendinglimits for election campaigns violate First Amendment free-speechrights.   The Hollings plan specifically would allow Congress to restrictthe amounts candidates can receive and spend. If the amendment wereratified, Congress would have to pass legislation setting limits.   Advocates of limits recite a litany of escalating campaigncosts: The average Senate winner spent $3 million in 1984, up from$600,000 in 1976. Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., says this translatesinto having to raise $10,000 a week during a six-year Senate term.   The legislation the amendment would supplant called for a systemof voluntary spending limits for Senate campaigns, with incentiveslike cheap postal and television advertising rates for participantsand public financing for them if opponents refused to observe thelimits.   That plan has 52 sponsors, 50 of them Democrats, includingMajority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who has been trying to bringit to a floor vote for nearly a year against near-solid Republicanopposition.   Republicans, arguing that limits would hamper their efforts togain strength in heavily Democratic states, held ranks through arecord eight cloture votes, the last coming Feb. 26 to end thefilibuster. Byrd never got more than 55 of the 60 votes needed toshut off Senate debate.   Hollings says he thinks he can get the support to beat anyfilibuster against his plan. But he said he's uncertain whether hecan get the 67 votes needed to get a proposed constitutionalamendment through the Senate.   He said Byrd has assured him the proposal will be brought to thefloor in the near future. ``I'm ready to go and he's ready to go,''said Hollings, adding that he hopes to get it approved this week bythe Judiciary Committee.   There is a different political mixture involved in theconstitutional amendment route than with the Byrd-Boren legislationto set up voluntary limits.   Hollings did not cosponsor the Byrd-Boren bill. Neither didamendment cosponsors Howell Heflin, D-Ala., or Strom Thurmond ofSouth Carolina, Judiciary's ranking Republican. Sen. William Roth,R-Del., is sponsoring a proposed limits amendment with slightlydifferent wording.   A small group of Republicans favors limits but supported GOPleaders in the partisan battle over the Byrd-Boren legislation.Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., voted against cloture eight times butnow says his ``strong inclination is to support this constitutionalamendment.''   He made the statement last week at a hearing by the Judiciarysubcommittee on the Constitution, where battle lines were drawn onboth political and constitutional grounds.   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., one of the filibuster leaders, saidhe still was opposing limits because they would favor Democrats. Iftelevision is driving up the cost of campaigning, he said, don'ttamper with the Constitution, force broadcasters to cut their adrates. If special interest money is becoming too dominant, outlawpolitical action committees, McConnell said.   Also opposing a limits amendment was the American CivilLiberties Union, represented by Joel Gora, the Brooklyn Law Schoolprofessor who was one of the winning lawyers in the Buckley-Valeocase.   ``The ACLU believes that government restrictions on politicalcampaign funding infringe on freedom of speech and association,''Gora said. ``They would enshrine in the Constitution itself thepower of government to restrict campaign activity and hencepolitical speech.''   But Washington attorney Lloyd Cutler, who helped argue thelosing side in the 1976 case, said larger questions are involved.   ``The evidence is overwhelming by now that unlimited campaignexpenditures will eventually grow to the point where they consumeso much of our political energies and so fracture our politicalconsensus that they will make the political process incapable ofgoverning effectively,'' Cutler said.   ``One might fairly paraphrase Lord Acton's famous aphorism aboutpower by saying: All political money corrupts; unlimited politicalmoney corrupts absolutely.''</TEXT></DOC>
