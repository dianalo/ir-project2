The announcement came in the early morning hours Tuesdayafter a full day of talks between the ANC and the government.ANC leader Nelson Mandela said his organization'sinfiltration of trained guerrillas and weapons into SouthAfrica would be stopped immediately, as would all militaryactivities inside the country. In return, the government saidit would begin a phased release of political prisoners andwould grant indemnity to some 20,000 ANC exiles so they canreturn to South Africa. A joint ANC-government committee willwork out the details and the timing of these moves.</LP><TEXT>   The marathon meeting in Pretoria -- the secondface-to-face session between the two sides since thegovernment unbanned the ANC and other opposition groups inFebruary -- seems to have cleared away the major obstacles tofull negotiations on a new constitution. Both the governmentand the ANC say they hope these talks can begin by early nextyear. In a joint statement, the two sides said they wereacting &quot;in the interest of moving as speedily as possibletoward a negotiated peaceful political settlement.&quot;   At a news conference following the meeting, Mr. Mandelacalled the suspension of the armed struggle &quot;a verysignificant concession&quot; on the ANC's part. And South AfricanPresident F.W. de Klerk said it marked an important turningpoint in bringing peace to the country, which has beenwracked by racial conflict for decades. Since the unbanningof the ANC earlier this year and other moves by thegovernment to end its policies of racial segregation known asapartheid, the level of violence has escalated, both from theheightened political activity of the blacks and from aright-wing white backlash.   Mr. Mandela and other ANC activists founded an armed wing,called Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, in 1960following the government's banning of the ANC. A few yearslater, Mr. Mandela and many of the ANC leaders not in exilewere arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment forconspiring to overthrow the government. Mr. Mandela was freedfrom prison after 27 years in February.   During the years of its armed activities, the ANCconsidered itself to be at war with the government. Itsguerrillas mainly targeted their attacks on governmentinstallations and on those in the black community consideredto be government collaborators. Still, occasional bombs inthe segregated white residential areas spread fear among thewhite community. In many shopping centers and cinemas inJohannesburg, visitors are routinely body-searched beforeentering.   In recent months, the ANC's armed struggle has beenlargely dormant, though the organization has continued tomove guerrillas and arms into the country. Last month, thegovernment claimed it uncovered &quot;Operation Vula,&quot; an ANC plandrawn up in 1987 to strengthen its underground in SouthAfrica. The police made dozens of arrests and uncoveredseveral arms caches, and alleged that it was part of a plotby the South African Communist Party to overthrow thegovernment in case the present negotiations fail.   After yesterday's meeting, Mr. Mandela said the CommunistParty, which is an ally of the ANC, also would be bound bythe agreement to suspend the armed struggle. The current andformer leaders of Umkhonto weSizwe are members of theCommunist Party as well as of the ANC.   Despite the suspension of its armed activities, the ANCsays it will continue with its protest politics, whichinclude mass marches, boycotts and strikes, until apartheidis ended and the blacks have a share of the political power.Through these actions, the ANC is also hoping to keep theloyalty of many black youths, who have been the mainsupporters of Umkhonto we Sizwe. Mr. Mandela said the ANCalso will continue to press the government to restrain thepolice in its dealing with black protesters.</TEXT></DOC>
