In a message to the opening session of Congress Wednesday, Sarneysaid Brazil has paid back $55 billion in interest since 1985, butthe total amount it owes hasn't changed.   Sarney will meet with President Bush in Tokyo this month todiscuss new solutions to the debt problem, the Foreign Ministry said.   Brazil's foreign debt is $115 billion, the largest in the ThirdWorld. The government says debt payments this year will totalbetween $12 billion and $14 billion.   ``The country cannot go on being an exporter of capital to therich countries,'' Sarney said.   ``We have normalized our accounts with international creditors,but the total of the debt and its respective servicing stillconstitute a serious restriction to our economy's development.''   Sarney said Brazil doesn't have enough money in its reserves topay $1.3 billion due in March to commercial banks and theInternational Monetary Fund.   He called a recent agreement to reschedule debt payments ``a stepforward,'' but added that it ``cannot be considered a definitivesolution.''   The $82 billion agreement calls for the rescheduling over 20years of debt due between 1987 and 1993, lower interest rates and$5.2 billion in new loans.   Brazil has insisted that new ideas are needed to reduce the LatinAmerican debt, estimated at more than $400 billion.   ``It is fundamental to insist on the political responsibility ofthe industrialized countries for the creation of institutionalmechanisms that permit a quick and definitive lowering of thedebt,'' Sarney said.   The debt will be on the agenda of a private meeting between Bushand Sarney when the presidents attend the funeral of JapaneseEmperor Hirohito in Tokyo this month, the Foreign Ministry said.   Sarney also will meet with Japanese Prime Minister NoburoTakeshita to discuss the release of $600 million in credits by theJapanese government, according to the ministry.   Brazil is counting on the Japanese loan, plus $500 million fromthe World Bank and $600 million from commercial banks to meet itsdebt obligations this year.   The Finance Ministry has warned that Brazil could again suspenddebt payments _ as it did in 1987 _ if its cash reserves fall toolow.   However, the level of Brazil's reserves depends largely on thesuccess of a radical anti-inflation plan announced last month.   The plan aimed at curbing 1,000 percent inflation includes afreeze on wages and prices and sharp cuts in government spending.   On Wednesday night, Sarney went on nationwide television andradio and said the plan was working, despite growing signs of laborunrest.   He said ``the specter of hyperinflation has been halted and priceincreases in February will be minimal.''   However, the president warned that ``a mania for striking'' couldbring instability to the 4-year-old civilian regime. Until 1985,Brazil was ruled for 21 years by a right-wing military government.   Labor unions have called for a national strike on March 14 and 15to protest the end of cost-of-living raises under the anti-inflationplan.</TEXT></DOC>
