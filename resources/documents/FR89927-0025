L. 100-242, approved February 5,1988). Section 165(a) authorizes HUD to require applicants and participants(and members of their households) in any HUD program involving loans, grants,interest or rental assistance of any kind, or mortgage or loan insurance,to disclose to HUD their Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or Employer IdentificationNumbers (EINs). This disclosure is made an explicit condition of initialor continuing eligibility for participation in any of these programs, andis also designed to ensure the proper level of benefits under these programs.The proposed rule implemented the requirements for the disclosure of SSNsand EINs through four independent, but parallel, provisions:1. <T3>24 CFR part 200, subpart T:</T3> This subpart covered the TMAP/Assignment,Occupied Conveyance, and Rent Supplement programs; the section 221(d)(3)BMIR, 235, and 236 programs; and the Management and Preservation of HUDMultifamily Projects authority under 24 CFR part 290.2. <T3>24 CFR part 200, subpart U:</T3> This subpart applied to the otherloan and mortgage insurance and coinsurance programs administered by HUDunder 24 CFR chapter II, subchapter B, including FHA loan insurance forproperty improvement and manufactured home loans under title I of the NationalHousing Act, and mortgage insurance for single family dwellings and multifamilyprojects under title II of the National Housing Act.3. <T3>24 CFR part 501:</T3> This part covered the Rehabilitation Loan, RentalRehabilitation, and Urban Homesteading programs, and elements of the CommunityDevelopment Block Grant (CDBG) and the Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG)programs, under 24 CFR chapter V.4. <T3>24 CFR part 750.</T3> This part covered the section 8 Housing AssistancePayments and the Public and Indian Housing programs administered by HUDunder 24 CFR chapters VIII and IX.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The remainder of the rule contained conforming changes that were designedto incorporate the proposed disclosure and verification requirements intothe regulatory provisions for the authorities involved.The proposed rule contained the following principal features. All applicantsseeking to participate in programs subject to the rule were required todisclose and verify their SSNs or EINs, depending on the nature of theapplicant. In the case of applicants seeking rental assistance (such asunder the section 8 and Public and Indian Housing authorities), the applicantand all members of his or her household had to meet the disclosure andverification requirements. In the case of individuals, and certain officialsof entities, desirous of becoming ``private owners'' of assisted projects,such as under the section 8 project-based subsidy authorities, only theindividuals involved had to disclose and verify SSNs. In the case of corporationsand other entities seeking to participate in cover programs as ``privateowners,'' the entities had to disclose and verify their EINs.The proposed rule also required the disclosure and verification of SSNsby participants (and their family members) in programs providing housingassistance that require determinations of continuing eligibility for theassistance involved. Examples of these programs include the Rent Supplementand the sections 235 and 236 programs, and the section 8 and Public andIndian Housing programs.The proposed rule provided guidance on the documentation required to verifyan SSN or EIN. It also specified that failure to meet the disclosure andverification requirements would result in denial of eligibility, or terminationof assistance or tenancy, as provided by the provisions governing the programinvolved. However, applicants or participants seeking rental assistancewho could provide their SSNs, but could not meet the verification requirements,were given 60 days to remedy the deficiency before losing their place onthe waiting list or having their assistance or tenancy terminated.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Public Comments and Changes Made in the Final Rule</ITAG>The Department received 11 comments on the proposed rule. Eight were fromPublic Housing Agencies (PHAs), and one each from a HUD Field Office, anational association, a city government, and a State Office of Communitiesand Development.Eight of the commenters expressed support for the proposed rule. Threeexpressed concern with it, generally on grounds that the rule was, in theirview, programmatically inflexible or administratively burdensome, or both.A number of commenters proposed changes for inclusion in the final rule.The following is a discussion of the comments on the proposed rule, aswell as any changes made to the final rule.Administrative BurdenSeveral of the commenters expressed concern over the costs of complyingwith the rule. One commenter questioned the cost-effectiveness of the rule'smandatory disclosure provisions, given the ``minimal'' incidence of fraudand abuse problems in its programs. Another commenter argued that fraudand abuse prevention can be carried out most effectively at the local level.This commenter stated that the local approach would be a ``more effectiveprevention measure than the inflexible, onerous and bureaucratic measuresproposed in the rule.''On the other hand, a number of commenters stated that the mandatory disclosurefeature of the rule would be a ``positive undertaking.'' These commentersbelieved that the rule would significantly increase the Department's abilityto combat fraud and abuse in its programs.The Department disagrees that the incidence of fraud and abuse in HUD'sassisted housing programs is minimal. In 1982, the Department's Officeof Inspector General (OIG) conservatively estimated that $200 million ispaid out annually to tenants who falsify their eligibility in order togain a larger assistance payment. It is conservatively estimated that atleast 12 percent of HUD-assisted households are able either to gain eligibilityor to receive more benefits than allowed by law, by underreporting theirincome or otherwise falsifying their eligibility. In some locations thepercentage may be much higher. In the most recent income computer matchingefforts by the OIG, $14.4 million was underreported to one PHA since 1983that resulted in the tenants' share of rent being underpaid by over $2.9million. Like a number of the commenters, the Department agrees that the rule'smandatory disclosure and verification of SSNs and EINs will be an importantweapon in the Department's efforts against this type of fraud and abusein the Department's programs. We do not, however, believe that the rulewill result in significantly increased administrative burdens, time, andcompliance costs. Under HUD Form HUD-50059 (assisted housing programs),PHAs and multifamily owners and agents are now required to collect SSNsfor each member of the family who receives income or who is at least 18years old. The PHAs and IHAs are now recording SSNs for the head of theapplicant/participant household, spouse, and one other adult, if providedby the family at admission or at annual reexamination. Although disclosureof the SSN is currently voluntary with the individual, the vast majorityof tenants do provide their numbers. The results of past HUD-OIG audits and computer matches have shown thatin approximately 75-80 percent of the cases, applicants and participantsare voluntarily providing SSNs/EINs to PHAs and multifamily owners andagents. A 1982 evaluation done under contract for HUD's Office of PolicyDevelopment and Research found that 92 percent of household heads reportname and SSN to HUD. No data was gathered for other than family head ofhousehold. Making disclosure mandatory should, therefore, not impose asignificant new burden on PHAs and other owners and agents. It is true that the rule's procedures for verifying SSNs are not presentlyrequired. In many instances, however, SSNs are routinely verified whenthe 50059s are reviewed for other eligibility factors, such as establishingidentity or family income. The PHAs and IHAs will verify a family's SSNsin conjunction with their verification of income, family status, and preferencecategory. Moreover, the Department has made every effort to limit the processingentity's verification functions to the minimum necessary to carry out therule's purposes. Thus, the Department does not believe that the rule'sverification procedures present a novel requirement that is unduly burdensome.Finally, the Department disagrees that a local approach would be more effective.We believe that an effective approach to fraud prevention requires a partnershipof Federal, State, and local resources, and that lines of communicationmust be established with the various Federal, State, and local agenciesinvolved in verifying information based on SSNs to make this a successfuljoint effort. For these reasons, the Department believes that the mandatory disclosurerequirements of the proposed rule will enhance the Department's abilityto detect instances of fraud, waste, and abuse in its programs, withoutappreciably increasing the administrative burdens on PHAs and private ownersof multifamily housing projects. Accordingly, the final rule is unchangedon this point. One commenter stated that in connection with CDBG-funded rehabilitationof owner-occupied homes and relocation payments to tenants of CDBG-rehabilitatedproperty, the rule's requirement for the disclosure of the SSNs of allfamily members over the age of six would entail additional home interviewswith program applicants, at a cost of $40 per visit, or $5,000 annually,if half of the applicants required such return visits. To this cost, thecommenter continued, must be added the expense of reporting the SSN datato HUD and retaining the data for possible future use. Guidance was requestedon the form and frequenty of the reports, and on the availability of additionalHUD monies for the new expenses. This comment is moot, because the Department has decided to eliminate fromthe rule's coverage the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program,as well as the Urban Homesteading and Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG)program. On further review, the Department does not believe that the benefitsto be derived from requiring the disclosure and verification of SSNs andEINs in these programs is sufficient to justify imposition of section 165'srequirements at this time. One commenter questioned the cost-effectiveness of HUD's expenses in processingdata reports from PHAs and other covered entities, and in carrying outplanned computer matchings. The Department's projected implementation ofthe rule is sufficient response to this comment. The Department does notintend to process data reports from PHAs and other project owners. In addition,the Department routinely conducts cost-benefit analyses before carryingout any computer matching activities_a practice that the Department intendsto continue in carrying out the rule's provisions.Two commenters opposed the provision in the proposed rule that requiresall family members to disclose their SSNs if there is a change in the compositionof the family. They argued that this requirement is redundant and burdensomefor those family members who have previously disclosed their SSNs to theentity involved. The Department agrees, and has made the necessary changesto the final rule.As a related matter, the Department has amended the proposed rule to makeseveral clarifying changes to the assisted housing programs subject tothe rule's requirements_24 CFR part 200, subpart T, and part 750. Thesechanges are designed to identify clearly which family members must disclosetheir SSNs, when the disclosure must take place, and what documentationis required to verify the SSNs. The changes also make clear that the applicantor participant_generally the head of household_is the individual who mustsubmit all required information to the processing entity.A summary chart of the final rule's complete disclosure and verificationrequirements for applicants and participants in these programs follows.The summary only covers family members who are required to disclose theirSSNs. In this regard, the final rule makes no change in those who mustmake this disclosure: Individuals who are under the age of six or who havenot been assigned an SSN are not subject to the rule's disclosure requirements.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r25</C> <H1>Family members who must disclose and when</H1><H1>Nature of disclosure</H1><ITAG tagnum="21">Applicants<R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">All family members: at eligibility determination <D>Complete and accurate SSNs for all SSNs assigned; valid SSN card orsuch other evidence as HUD (and PHA in part 750) may prescribe as proofof each SSN</D><R>sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Those who were participants before effective date of rule<R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">All family members: at next regularly scheduled income reexaminationafter rule's effective date <D>Complete and accurate SSNs for all SSNs assigned; valid SSN card orsuch other evidence as HUD (and PHA in part 750) may prescribe as proofof each SSN</D><R>sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Participants who have made either of the above disclosures<R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Special circumstances<R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">New family member: next interim or regularly scheduled income reexaminationthat includes the new family member <D>Complete and accurate SSNs for all SSNs assigned to the family memberinvolved; valid SSN card or such other evidence as HUD (and PHA in part750) may prescribe as proof of each SSN</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Family member who is assigned a new SSN or who obtains a previouslyundisclosed SSN; next regularly scheduled income reexamination <D/><R>sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Special Circumstances in Administrative Instructions<R/></ITAG>HUD (and the PHA in part 750) may specify in administrative instructionsadditional disclosure and verification requirements, including the natureof the disclosure and verification required, and the time and manner formaking the disclosure and verification.</ITAG>This summary contains the change described above, to require only <T3>new </T3>family members (rather than all family members) to verifytheir SSNs. This is required to take place at the next income reexamination,irrespective of whether the reexamination is interim or regularly scheduled.Finally, it should be noted that all members of participating familieswho are subject to the rule's disclosure requirements are not, in the absenceof special circumstances, subject to further disclosure and verificationof their SSNs.One commenter indicated that HUD's failure to use HUD Form 50058 will resultin duplicate reporting of SSNs_both on the 50058 and some other form tobe submitted to HUD. The commenter asked when the Department intended tobegin using the 50058 as had been intended.The Department intends to use both Form HUD-50058 and Form HUD 50059 togather the SSNs of assisted families. No additional forms will be used,thus obviating any duplicate reporting.Program InflexibilityA number of the comments addressed perceived instances of unnecessary inflexibilityin the proposed rule. One PHA commenter argued that the rule's effectivedate is too abrupt. The proposed rule covered all applicant eligibilitydeterminations initiated on or after the rule's effective date, as wellas each regularly scheduled reexamination of family income conducted onor after that date. The commenter urged adoption of a six-month delayedeffective date, to permit the PHA to devise necessary implementing formsand procedures.As noted earlier, under Form HUD-50059, PHAs and IHAs are not recordingSSNs for certain family members. The Department believes that PHAs' andIHAs' experience with this requirement_as well as the large number of familiesthat voluntarily provide their SSNs_removes any need for a delayed implementationdate. The final rule makes no change in the proposed rule's effective dates.The same PHA commenter argued that the proposed rule was too harsh in requiringthat tenancy be terminated for any participant family that does not meetthe rule's disclosure and verification requirements. The commenter recommendedinstead a two-part process. If the tenant fails to provide SSNs for eachcovered household member, but the PHA believes that eviction is not otherwisewarranted, the unit rent would be increased to eliminate the Federal subsidyuntil the SSNs are provided. Where, however, a tenant has unreasonablyfailed to submit assigned SSNs for each family member, and the PHA believesthat eviction is warranted, tenancy would be terminated.The Department disagrees that the proposed rule's provisions requiringtermination of tenancy for program participants who fail to make the requiredSSN disclosures is unduly harsh. Indeed, section 165 of the 1987 Act specificallyenvisions such a penalty, by making disclosure of SSNs a condition of botheligibility and continuing eligibility for covered programs.Moreover, if a family participating in a covered housing assistance programwas unable to produce the documentation necessary to verify the requiredSSNs, the proposed rule provided a period of 60 days within which the SSNscould be documented. During this period, a participant family would continueto receive assistance. The Department believes that this time period issufficiently long to enable a reasonably diligent individual to obtainthe necessary documentation, and to avoid the more serious penalties oftermination of assistance/tenancy.Given the clear meaning of section 165 and the considerable time providedfamily members to produce the requisite SSN documentation, the Departmentdoes not believe that the proposed rule's penalties for failing to supplythe required documentation of SSNs were unduly harsh. The final rule isunchanged on this point.A commenter indicated that it currently handles income verification bymail for participants (but not applicants) in its section 8 programs. Requiringthese participants to send originals, or even copies, of their SSNs throughthe mail would, in the commenter's view, be unnecessarily burdensome bothfor the individual_especially elderly persons_and the PHA (which must returnthe material to the family).The commenter suggests instead that the rule only require family memberswhose incomes are verified by mail to list the SSNs, rather than send proofof the numbers. Verification of the SSNs would be carried out through computermatch at a later time.The Department believes that verification of participant data my mail isa useful technique to relieve the administrative burdens on PHAs and assistedfamilies alike. The Department also agrees with the commenter that sendingoriginal evidence through the mails is both burdensome and increases thechance of losing important documents.We do not agree, however, that where documentation of the SSN would otherwisebe required, the only means of verification should be by computer match.The proposed rule adopted the most efficacious means of ensuring the completeand accurate disclosure of SSNs_examination of the actual documents involved.The Department believes that although original documents ought not be sentthrough the mail, copies of the documents should be made available to thePHA or other entity processing the family's SSNs.The Department believes that this approach strikes the appropriate balancebetween the legitimate interests of PHAs in reducing administrative burdensand the interest expressed in section 165 of the 1987 Act in ensuring thatthere are adequate safeguards against fraud and abuse in HUD's programs.PHAs would have the ``next best evidence'' of the SSNs involved, withoutthe costs of processing and returning originals and the risk of loss ifthe originals were sent through the mail.Accordingly, where a PHA provides for verification by mail of the continuingeligibility of participant families in the Certificate, Voucher, or ModerateRehabilitation program, it may verify SSNs in this way as well. The tenantmust provide copies of the documentation otherwise required for SSNs underthe rule.As a related point, another commenter asked whether the final rule shouldprovide for waiver of the documentation requirement for elderly families,when the documentation is not readily available. The Department agreeswith the commenter's concern about the ability of some elderly tenantsto comply with the proposed rule's documentation requirements, even withinthe 60 additional days provided by the rule. We do not believe, however,that the commenter's suggested waiver of all documentation requirementsis necessary or faithful to section 165's objective of protecting againstfraud and abuse in the Department's programs.The Department believes that the best approach is to permit PHAs and otherprocessing entities in the covered programs to give elderly families another60-day period, after the proposed rule's 60-day period, to supply the requireddocumentation. We believe that this approach is consistent with section165's purposes, while affording the additional time that some elderly familiesmay need to gather the necessary information. The final rule has been amendedaccordingly.Two commenters questioned the rule's provision that requires all familymembers above the age of six to disclose their SSNs. One commenter askedwhether the PHA will be put in the position of breaking up families byrequiring any member who fails to produce the SSN to move out. The othercommenter argued that some households will have great difficulty in complyingwith this requirement and that the requirement is too inflexible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Specifically, the commenter stated,<ITAG tagnum="21">We do not relish the prospects of insisting on seeing documentationfor every child before payments can be made, when we ourselves know thatthe case is urgent and deserving.</ITAG>Initially, it should be noted that the proposed rule did not require theissuance of SSNs for all family members: only those who are over the ageof five and who have been assigned an SSN, had to disclose it. As notedin the preamble to the proposed rule (53 FR 40627), use of the six-year-oldstandard is consistent with section 6109(e) of the Internal Revenue Codeof 1986. That provision requires taxpayers to include in their tax returnsa dependent's SSN whenever claiming one or more exemptions for dependentsage five or older. Thus, the Department considers this requirement neithernovel nor unreasonably burdensome.With regard to the ``family splitting'' issue, the Department would notethat section 165 of the 1987 Act clearly contemplates that all family memberswho have an SSN will disclose it, as a condition of eligibility, or continuingeligibility, under a covered program. Thus, the rule's statutory authority,and not the rule alone, provides for the ineligibility of a family in whichone or more members fail to meet the requisite SSN disclosure and documentation.In addition, the Department has taken care to ensure that families willnot be rendered ineligible_either as applicants or participants_withoutreceiving adequate time to secure the necessary documentation. The proposedrule only required the disclosure and verification of SSNs that have beenassigned to the individual. If the individual cannot produce the requireddocumentation, he or she would receive 60 days to do so (with an additional60 days for elderly tenants, as discussed above). The Department continuesto believe that this period is adequate to secure the necessary documentation,and that families will not unreasonably be denied initial or continuingaccess to assistance under the covered programs.Other IssuesTwo commenters urged HUD to make the disclosure of SSNs a joint Federal-State-localeffort, by establishing lines of communication with the various Federal,State, and local agencies involved in verifying SSNs under the rule. Thecommenters indicated that these agencies sometimes charge for their verificationservices, and urged HUD to encourage these agencies to waive such chargesfor PHAs and local community development agencies attempting to complywith the rule.Neither the proposed nor final rule requires the third-party verificationto which the commenters refer. As indicated above, however, the Departmentbelieves that intergovernmental cooperation is an essential element inefforts to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in its programs, and intendsto explore ways to develop and enhance these relationships in the future.One commenter indicated that the rule may permit section 8 Certificateand Voucher assistance to commence, even though the project owner may nothave verified the family's SSN. The commenter asked how the owner and familywill know that their subsidies will not be interrupted because of lackof proper identification.This comment appears to proceed from a misunderstanding of how the Certificateand Voucher programs work. Eligibility under these programs is determinedby the PHA. If the PHA finds a family eligible (which will include acceptanceof the applicant's SSN documentation), the family is given a ``certificate''or ``voucher'' with which to rent a qualifying dwelling. The private ownermay select the tenant and enter into a Housing Assistance Payments Contractwith the PHA, but only after the PHA issues the Certificate or Voucher.Thus, the private owner has no responsibilities with respect to SSN information:the disclosure and verification of the family's SSNs takes place beforethe private owner enter the picture.One commenter raised two technical suggestions: That language be insertedto ensure that parents or guardians can sign required certifications onbehalf of minors and that the rule make clear that the Voucher programis covered by the rule. The final rule contains each of these suggestions.Finally, the Department has made several changes in the final rule, basedon its review of the proposed rule. First, the proposed rule would havepermitted PHAs administering the section 8 Certificate, Voucher, or ModerateRehabilitation program:_To determine additional special circumstances under which participantswould have to disclose their SSNs'_To establish alternate documents or other substantiation of SSNs' and_To designate someone other than a minor family member to certify to thefact that the individual has been assigned an SSN, but cannot produce evidenceto verify it.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The final rule permits PHAs to exercise this authority only in conjunctionwith the Department's administrative instructions. This change is necessaryto comply with section 165: HUD is given sole responsibility to implementsection 165_a responsibility that could not be fully discharged if PHAshave unfettered discretion to exercise the cited discretion.Second, for FHA and other programs that provide for one-time eligibilitydeterminations, the final rule requires the disclosure and verificationof SSNs for the applicant and any family member who will be liable on themortgage or loan debt or other instrument. The Department does not believethat subjecting all members of such an applicant's family to section 165'srequirements is necessary to furthering the rule's fraud, waste, and abusepurposes. By the same token, those whom the financing documents identifyas responsible for payment of the indebtedness should be required to discloseand verify their SSNs.Third, the proposed rule imposed its disclosure and verification requirementsonly on ``individual applicants'' who assume an existing, unsubsidizedFHA insured loan. ``Individual applicants'' for both single family andmultifamily mortgages were covered. There is no real distinction between``individual applicants'' and ``entity applicants,'' and subsidized andunsubsidized mortgages, from the standpoint of fraud, waste, and abuseconcerns. Thus, the Department has amended the final rule to make clearthat all types of FHA assumptions are covered by section 165.  Fourth, the proposed rule covered the Temporary Mortgage Assistance Payments(TMAP)/Assignment programs published at 52 FR 6915 (March 5, 1987). Thistreatment was premised on the expectation that the programs would havebecome operational in time for this final rule. This has not occurred,and the final rule deletes them from its coverage. It should be noted,however, that the final rule leaves intact a provision subjecting the currentAssignment program to its provisions. When the new TMAP/Assignment programsare implemented, the Department will take the steps necessary to bringit within the rule's ambit.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Certifications  </ITAG><T3>Environment  </T3>A Finding of No Signifiant Impact with respect to the environment has beenmade in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

The only entities subject to the rule that are covered by the Order arePHAs and State Housing Finance Agencies in their role as ``processing entities.''These entities already perform significant functions with respect to applicantsand participants in HUD assistance programs, including the collection ofSSNs from program applicants and participants. As noted above, the Departmentdoes not believe that the additional burden imposed by the rule to collectand verify SSNs will be substantial.  <T3>Executive Order 12606, The Family  </T3>The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,<T3>The Family, </T3>has determined that this rule does not have potentialfor significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order.  The rules's principal effect on families involves those seeking or receivingrental assistance under several FHA assistance programs (see 24 CFR part200, subpart T) and the section 8 Housing Assistance Payments programsand the Public and Indian Housing programs (see 24 CFR part 750). The ruleprovides that these families must disclose and verify their SSNs if theyare to receive, or continue receiving, Federal assistance. To guard againstthe precipitate denial of eligibility or loss of assistance that couldimpose extreme financial hardship on these applicants and participants,those who cannot substantiate their SSNs are given a reasonable periodto obtain proper evidence of their SSN before they are held ineligiblefor initial or continuing assistance. As noted earlier, the departmentbelieves that this scheme provides families adequate opportunity to complywith the rule's requirements before any action is taken with respect totheir eligibility, or continuing eligibility, for the program. Thus, anyeffect that the rule may have on family formation, maintenance, or well-beingshould not be significant.  <T3>Semiannual Agenda of Regulations </T3>This rule was not listed on the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulationspublished on April 24, 1989 (54 FR 16708) pursuant to Executive Order 12291and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <T3>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance </T3>The catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 14.103,14.112, 14.115, 14.116, 14.117, 14.121, 14.123, 14.124, 14.125, 14.126,14.127, 14.128, 14.129, 14.133, 14.134, 14.135, 14.137, 14.139, 14.151,14.156, 14.161, 14.164, 14.218, 14.219, 14.221, 14.223, 14.225, 14.227,14.230, 14.232, 14.580, 14.850, 14.851, and 14.852.  <ITAG tagnum="84"><T3>Information Collection Requirements  </T3></ITAG>The collection of information requirements contained in this rule havebeen submitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980. Virtually all of the sections of this rule havebeen determined by the Department to contain collection of informationrequirements. Information on these requirements is provided as follows: On September 22, 1988, the Department requested approval of the informationcollection requirements contained in this rule. On November 19, 1988, OMBfiled comments on the request pursuant to section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act. Those comments involved four concerns. These concerns, andthe Department's response, are outlined below.First, the Department listed inconsistently the current information collectionsthat would be affected by this rulemaking. The proposed rule indicatedthat information collections with OMB Control Numbers 2502-0118 and 2502-0267would be affected. The paperwork package submitted to OMB, however, didnot mention these information collections. Also, the paperwork packagesubmitted to OMB indicated that information collection 2502-0018 wouldbe affected, but the proposed rule did not indicate this. OMB asked theDepartment to clarify for the public precisely which information collectionswould be affected by this rule. To clarify this point, there are nine information collections affectedby this rule. They include: (1) 2502-0159; (2) 2502-0268; (3) 2502-0204;(4) 2502-0082; (5) 2502-0118; (6) 2502-0059; (7) 2502-0267; (8) 2506-0076;and (9) 2577-0083. In addition, information collections 2502-0118 and 2502-0267are in the rule and have current OMB approval. Information collection 2502-0018was a typographical error and has been corrected to 2502-0118. The finalrule omits 24 CFR parts 501, 590, and 570; therefore, the following informationcollections have been omitted: (1) ``SSNs/EINs from Urban Homesteaders'';(2) ``SSNs/EINs from Families, Individuals, Businesses, and Farms SeekingRelocation Assistance''; and (3) ``SSNs/EINs on Form SF-424 Urban DevelopmentAction Grants (2506-0040).'' OMB's second concern was that in the proposed rule and paperwork submittedfor OMB review, the Department indicated that two information collectionshad currently valid OMB control numbers (2502-0082 and 2506-0040) for collectionsof SSN and EIN information, when in fact, the OMB approval for these collectionsexpired in March 1988 and January 1988, respectively. In response to this concern, information collection 2502-0082 is pendingapproval by OMB and 24 CFR part 570 (requiring information collection 2506-0040)was deleted from the rule because of the belief that the benefits of disclosingand verifying SSNs/EINs does not justify the imposition of this requirement.The third concern of OMB was that the Department had requested approvalof the collection of SSN and EIN information for only three programs. OMBnoted that for the other programs identified in the proposed rule and paperworksubmissions, the Department did not request paperwork approval and offeredno indication of precisely how this rulemaking will affect program applicantsand participants. OMB stated that if the Department wishes to collect thisinformation for the other programs, the Department must comply with Section3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 by demonstrating either(1) that the implementation of this rulemaking will not affect in any waythe current information requirements imposed on the public for each programor (2) that the imposition of the information requirements in the rulemaking,for each affected program, is consistent with the approval criteria at5 CFR 1320.4. In response to this concern, the Department agrees that the paperwork submissiondid not contain paperwork approval for all programs covered by the proposedrule. The paperwork submission was revised to include nine informationcollections for each affected program. The revised paperwork submissionalso includes an indication of precisely how this rulemaking will affectprogram applicants and participants. For further clarification, the Department notes that the three reportingrequirements submitted for OMB approval are no longer relevant, since 24CFR parts 501, 590, and 570 are not included in the final rule. The Departmenthas excluded requiring SSNs/EINs from Urban Homesteaders, families, individuals,businesses and farms seeking relocation assistance and Urban DevelopmentAction Grant recipients. OMB's final concern was that part 200, subpart U, and part 501 should berevised to indicate that an individual identity need not submit an SSNor EIN to the Department more than once. Changes have been made in therule to eliminate multiple submissions of this data.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Information Collections for FR-</T4>2501<H1>Description of information collection</H1><H1>Section of 24 CFR affected</H1><H1>Number of respondents</H1><H1>Number of responses per respondents</H1><H1>Total annual responses</H1><H1>Hours per response</H1><H1>Total hours</H1><H1>Status</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">SSNs/EINs \1\ on Housing Form HUD-92068F, Request for Financial Information(2502-0159)<D>203</D><D>76,000</D><D>1</D><D>76,000</D><D>0.0056 \2\</D><D>426</D><D>Expires, 11/30/90</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">SSNs/EINs on Housing Form HUD-9539, Request for Occupied Conveyance(2502-0268)<D>203</D><D>4,600</D><D>8.6</D><D>39,600</D><D>0.0056</D><D>222</D><D>Expires, 8/31/90</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">SSNs/EINs on Housing Form HUD-50059, Owner's Certification of Compliance(2502-0204)<D>215, 221, 236, 247, 290, 750, 880, 881, 883, 884, 885, 886</D><D>2,171,256</D><D>1</D><D>2,171,256</D><D>0.0056</D><D>12,159</D><D>Expires, 4/30/90</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">SSNs/EINs \3\ on Housing Form HUD-93101 Recertification of Family Incomeand Composition (2502-0082)<D>235</D><D>150,962</D><D>varies</D><D>199,044</D><D>0.0056</D><D>1,115</D><D>Expired, 2/29/89 (Pending OMB approval)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">SSNs/EINs on Housing Form HUD-2530, Previous Participation Certificate(2502-0118)<D>207, 213, 215, 221, 232, 236, 241, 242, 244, 250, 251, 252, 255</D><D>9,000</D><D>1</D><D>9,000</D><D>0.0056</D><D>50</D><D>Expires, 5/31/92</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">SSNs/EINs on Housing Forms HUD-92900, -92004G Application for HUD/FHAInsured Mortgage (2502-0059)<D>200, 201, 203, 205, 213, 221, 234, 235</D><D>1,603,334</D><D>1</D><D>1,603,334</D><D>0.0056</D><D>8,979</D><D>Expires, 9/30/89</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">SSNs/EINs on Housing Form HUD-92013, Sec. 202 Application SubmissionRequirements (2502-0267)<D>885</D><D>1,300</D><D>1</D><D>1,300</D><D>0.0056</D><D>7</D><D>Expires, 5/31/91</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">SSNs/EINs on Forms HUD-6230, 6243, andamp; 40023, Sec. 312 Loan Program(2506-0076)<D>510</D><D>800</D><D>13.1</D><D>10,536</D><D>0.0056</D><D>59</D><D>Expires, 2/29/90</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">SSNs/EINs on Form HUD-50058, Tenant Data Summary (2577-0083)<D>750,813, 882, 887, 900, 904, 905, 913, 960</D><D>3,500</D><D>754</D><D>2,640,000</D><D>0.0056</D><D>14,784</D><D>Expires, 3/31/91</D><R>n,n,n,n,n,n,s,n</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total Annual Burden<D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>37,801</D><D/><F>\1\ SSNs/EINs = Social Security Numbers/Employer Identification Numbers.</F><F>\2\ 0.0056 hour = 2.0 seconds.</F><F>\3\ This information collection requirement has been submitted to theOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980.
