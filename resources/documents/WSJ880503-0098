In proxy materials for the banking company's annual meeting later this month, Worthen said the family of Jackson T. Stephens bought 1,474,507 common shares for $5.9 million, or $4 a share, from investment companies controlled by Mochtar and James T. Riady, a father and son team operating in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Los Angeles. Based on yesterday's closing price of $7.50 a share for Worthen stock on the American Stock Exchange, the Stephens purchase represents a discount of 46.7%.    Last December, the Stephens family announced that it had tentatively agreed to purchase a 13.7% Worthen stake from the Riady interests but the purchase price wasn't disclosed. The Riadys said at the time that they were refocusing their U.S. investment interests on California and New York. The sale was completed last month. The Riadys continue to hold about 100,000 shares in Worthen, Arkansas's largest banking company. Both Riadys once served on Worthen's board, but they have resigned.    The shares bring the Stephens family's stake to nearly 3.4 million shares, or about 31.2% of Worthen's common stock outstanding. The shares are held by Mr. Stephens's wife, Mary Anne, a trust for his son, Warren A. Stephens, and a family trust of Jackson Stephens's brother, Wilton R. Stephens. The Stephens brothers are principal shareholders of Little Rock's Stephens Inc., a large investment banking and brokerage firm that is considered one of the largest off Wall Street in terms of capital.    Because of federal law separating investment banking from commercial banking, the Stephens interest in Worthen has drawn scrutiny by regulators. No members of the Stephens family are on the Worthen board.    Worthen Banking officials said the Stephens-Riady stock purchase was a privately negotiated transaction and it didn't have any comment on the sharply discounted price. A spokesman for Stephens interests said the discount may reflect the difficulties the Riadys might have had in attempting to sell such a large block to anyone else. Others speculated that the favorable price offset losses the Stephenses had in unrelated foreign investments arranged by the Riadys. The Stephens spokesman said he hadn't any knowledge of such losses.    As for the Riadys, who began accumulating Worthen shares in 1984, their Worthen holdings were once valued at more than $20 million. This sale leaves them with a loss of about $15 million. They couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
