Reagan, meanwhile, helped Bush on a major issuedogging his campaign.   In Washington, the president said he had decided _ against hisbetter judgment _ to allow a plant-closing notification bill tobecome law. He said he wanted to end Democratic ``politicalshenanigans.''   Bush, in a foreign policy speech in Chicago, said: ``I think thepresident made a good decision, and that matter is now resolved andnow we can get the focus where it belongs, on plant openings.''   A Bush spokesman suggested Reagan's action would prevent furtherefforts by presidential rival Michael Dukakis and other Democratsto use the issue against Bush.   But Dukakis rejected the idea that he no longer had the issue inhis battle with Bush.   ``I don't think we lost an issue,'' said Dukakis, who spent theday at the Massachusetts statehouse. ``I think we won a greatvictory.''   And Leslie Dach, Dukakis' spokesman, told reporters after thegovernor's news conference: ``The vice president opposed the bill.The president still said it was a terrible bill. Certainly it'sgoing to be an issue right through November.''   Dukakis credited Congress, and in particular running mate Sen.Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, with forcing Reagan to make the decision.Dukakis said the progress of the plant-closing bill and otherlegislation _ all sponsored by Democrats _ had ``a great deal to dowith the attitude of the American people that they want somethingdifferent.''   Bentsen told reporters at a news conference, ``I certainly thinkthat plant closing is going to remain a very strong issue and itshows the difference, that we are for fairness in this.''   Bentsen said of Reagan, ``I think he saw the polls, and I thinkhe also saw what was going to happen in the Senate.''   Reagan said that Democrats in Congress had exploited publicsentiment on the issue. The president had vetoed an earlier tradebill, citing the inclusion of a provision that requires a 60-dayadvance notice of plant closings and layoffs involving companieswith 50 or more employees.   The veto was upheld, but both the House and Senate subsequentlypassed a separate plant-closing bill by seemingly veto-proofmargins.   The Democrats have used the issue to suggest the Reaganadministration lacks compassion for blue-collar workers.   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said Reagan's decisionwould put a damper on Democratic plans ``for the political game tobe played over the plant-closing issue.''   Dukakis has argued strongly in favor of requiring notification,raising the issue in his speech to the Democratic NationalConvention in Atlanta.   Dayton Duncan, a Dukakis aide, said Reagan's decision is a``testament to the people around the nation who supported thisbill.'' Asked if the decision takes an issue away from Dukakis, hesaid: ``Not at all. The point is that Ronald Reagan and George Bushtried to stop it. Where is George on this? He used to oppose it.''   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said after Reagan'sannouncement, ``Even though Ronald Reagan still occupies the WhiteHouse, we can safely say Michael Dukakis has just signed into lawhis first bill as president.''   In his speech, Bush took a sharp jab at his opponent's abilityto succeed in the White House based on experience as governor ofMassachusetts.   ``It is not a time for timidity, hesitancy and on-the-jobtraining,'' Bush told the Mid-America Committee. ``This new erademands from America, and its elected officials, firm, consistentand experienced leadership.''   Bush said, ``President Reagan and I'' have worked successfullyto restore American leadership since taking office and have``repaired our nation's defenses, modernized our strategic nuclearforces, deployed intermediate nuclear forces in Europe and restoredpride in our nation's military services.''   The vice president, outlining his foreign policy plans, said hewould deploy a space-based missile defense system ``as soon asfeasible,'' provide support to freedom fighters around the worldand continue arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union _ butwarily.   On the issue of freedom fighters, Bentsen on Tuesday called fora new aid package for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels that includesstandby military supplies. Unlike Dukakis who strongly opposesContra aid, Bentsen has consistently voted for assistance to therebel forces fighting the Sandinista government.   As Democrats met behind closed doors to work on the aid package,Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., a former Republicanpresidential candidate and possible Bush running mate, sought tohighlight the differences on the issue between Bentsen and Dukakis.   ``It is a political issue,'' Dole told reporters. ``There is aschism between the two candidates. Senator Bentsen was right.Governor Dukakis is wrong.''   In his speech, Bush said the Soviet Union should be judged by``what it delivers'' in arms reductions, human rights, immigrationand lessening of tensions around the globe.   He spoke forcefully in favor of Reagan's Strategic DefenseInitiative, also known as ``Star Wars,'' which Dukakis hascriticized.   In a comment that seemed to open up a new argument for thesystem as well as challenge Dukakis, Bush said, ``It is one thingto say you are committed to Israel's security, but in an age ofballistic missiles, if you are against defensive systems such asSDI, that slogan has little meaning.''   In Boston, Christopher Edley, Jr., national issues director forthe Dukakis campaign, questioned Bush's logic, saying ``the pointmakes no sense whatsoever.''   ``Israel's security is no more an important argument for SDIthan water quality or auto safety is an argument for SDI,'' Edleysaid.   The vice president later returned to Washington where he told arally of ethnic leaders supporting his candidacy that he will winbecause ``I can speak our language of ethnic values and pride,everlasting pride in the United States of America.''   ``We are the only hope for freedom and democracy in the world,''Bush told about 200 members of the Bush-88 Coalition of AmericanNationalities. ``I'll never apologize for the United States ofAmerica, ever. I don't care what the facts are.''   Some may wonder,``what's a nice WASP like you doing '' in thecompany of such ethnic Americans as Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.;Edward J. Derwinski, a top State Department official and formerChicago congressman, and Joseph Evara, president of the Sons ofItaly, Bush said.   ``We'll, it's values. That's why I'm a member.'' he said.   Earlier, Bush's aide, Fuller, said the list of possible runningmates had been narrowed somewhat in recent days, but he gave nofurther information on that issue.</TEXT></DOC>
