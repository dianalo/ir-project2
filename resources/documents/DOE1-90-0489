Our formulas includethe effect of short-range correlations by means of local-field corrections,and reduce to the random-phase approximation when these corrections areneglected. Explicit calculations, using a Hubbard-like approximationfor the local-field corrections, show that the acoustic plasmon existsonly at comparatively small wave vectors. Strong short-range correlationsmay even suppress it.</TEXT></DOC>
