The Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983 (Pub. L. 98-76)altered the manner in which railroad compensation and service months arereported to the Board and credited to an employee's account.On January 23, 1987, the Board published Parts 209, 210 and 211 as a proposedrule and invited comments for 30 days ending February 22, 1987 (52 FR 2553-2557).The Board received three comments from the Association of American Railroadsconcerning the reporting requirements of the Board with respect to employersunder the Railroad Retirement Act. Those recommendations, even if adopted,would not require any change in these regulations. Accordingly, the Boardhas decided to publish the regulations as a final rule and will continueto consider adoption of the comments of the Association of American Railroads.Incorrect citations were also noted in section 10 of the proposed regulationswith respect to its revisions of andSection; 211.2(b)(11). These correctionswere made.The Board has determined that this is not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required. Theinformation collections associated with these amendments have been approvedby the Office of Management and Budget.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>20 CFR Part 209Railroad employees, Railroad retirement, Railroads.20 CFR Part 210Railroad employees, Railroad retirement.20 CFR Part 211Railroad employees, Railroad retirement.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 209_RAILROAD EMPLOYERS REPORTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES</ITAG>1.
