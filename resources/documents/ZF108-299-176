Rosch's review of trackballs criticizesLogitech's TrackMan unjustly.andP;  The trackball actually rests upon threehigh-quality ball bearings.andP;  The two other contact points noted by thereviewer are actually the tracking mechanism and provide no support.andM;TrackMan is unique in that its tracking mechanism is isolated from itssupport structure.andP;  Two springs press the tracking wheels against the ball,ensuring that rotation of the ball is accurately monitored.andP;  Other trackballshave the balls resting directly upon the tracking mechanism, leading toalignment problems.andM;Logitech's driver does emulate the Microsoft Mouse driver interface, and isguaranteed to support any application that supports the Microsoft Mouse.andM;Logitech's driver is different because it supports three buttons.andP;  Most CADapplications take advantage of the three buttons to make their programs moreuseful.andM;Also, the TrackMan cable is nine feet long.andM;Betty SkovandM;Logitech Inc.andM;Fremont, Calif.andM;Winn Rosch responds:andM;Thank you for the clarification.andP;  A Logitech product manager confirmed to PCWeek that TrackMan uses a five-point support system and that the device wasnot hardware-compatible with the Microsoft Mouse.andM;TrackMan's mechanism is in some ways more complex than it has to be and mayrequire alignment.andM;TrackMan does not use the Microsoft Mouse protocol, thus is not plug-and-playcompatible on a hardware level.andM;We agree, however, that Logitech's driver, which emulates the MicrosoftMouse, works with most software applications.andM;CHANGING WITH THE TIMESandM;To the Editor:andM;The recent well-written article by Jane Morrissey (March 12) exploring BanyanSystems Inc.'s marketing efforts may have left the inaccurate impression thatthe company is faltering.andM;Far from it.andP;  Banyan continues to expand its wide area networking technology,and few can equal its reputation for technical excellence.andP;  Like any companyattuned to rapidly changing markets, Banyan occasionally shifts its focus.andO;So does IBM, for that matter -- and virtually every other company thatintends to meet customers' growing needs.andM;Though it's a small point, I must also question the judgment in slightingBanyan for achieving &quot;only&quot; 70 percent annual growth in 1989.andP;  How quickly weforget that last year the overwhelming majority of the industry settled forfar less.andM;As the leading third-party developer of applications for Banyan's VINESnetworks, we remain absolutely assured of Banyan's continued success.andM;Robert SheaandM;Trellis Software Inc.andM;Hopkinton, Mass.andM;AN OPTICAL SOLUTIONandM;To the Editor:andM;In her March 19 column, Diane Danielle asks, &quot;How Can We Get Users To CleanUp Their Disks?&quot; The answer is, &quot;Don't!&quot;andM;Ever figured out the cost of having users look through all their old filesevery month?andP;  It's a lot more than adding optical storage.andM;What's needed is an archiving system that moves files from the users' activedirectories onto cheap optical storage based on a last-use date, and thenlets them retrieve an archived file within a few minutes if it is required.andM;Martin SmithandM;Federal Banyan Users GroupandM;Washington, D.C.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
