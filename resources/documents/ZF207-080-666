Mackichan Jr.andP;  asked the panelto dismiss the challenge with prejudice, because as only a potentialsubcontractor on the procurement, MCI, had &quot;no right&quot; to bring its complaintbefore the board.andM;&quot;MCI's protest complaint represents a late entreaty from a disgruntlednon-offerer who now improperly seeks to use the board as another forum topursue its business objectives and exert competitive pressure on its rivals.andO;A procurement may not be undone by such a party,&quot; Mackichan wrote.andM;Calling MCI's action irresponsible, the GSA official said to permit thecompany's protest to proceed would allow &quot;marketplace rivalries to confoundorderly government processes.&quot;andM;MCI was a key member of the Martin Marietta Corp. team that came awayempty-handed from the competition to upgrade the federal government'slong-distance communications system.andP;  MCI surprised observers by filing acomplaint with the GSBCA challenging GSA's selection of ATandamp;T to supply amajority share of the FTS 2000 services.andM;The filing was made on Feb. 6, almost exactly two months after GSA decided tosplit the contract on a 60-40 basis between ATandamp;T and US Sprint CommunicationsCo., Kansas City, Mo.andP;  Last week, after a hearing before the board, MCIamended the protest.andM;Prime bidder Martin Marietta, which earlier appeared to have taken the lossof the contract in stride, has followed MCI's complaint with anadministrative protest filed with the contracting officer for the FTS 2000award, Carol A. Hall.andM;Telephone calls at press time to inquire about Martin Marietta's reasons forcomplaining were not returned.andP;  The usually reticent defense contractor has areputation for not challenging adverse contract decisions.andM;Both companies' challenges stem from a tariff ATandamp;T filed Jan. 24 with theFederal Communications Commission.andP;  The timing of the filing could cause theprotests to be judged as timely.andP;  The tariff filing, in which ATandamp;T asserts itdid not engage in predatory pricing, also includes the prices ATandamp;T willcharge for its FTS 2000 services.andM;However, the version of the tariff filing that was made public does notinclude the FTS 2000 prices.andP;  ATandamp;T asked the FCC to keep the prices secretbecause GSA expects to ask ATandamp;T and Sprint to compete for the FTS businessanew at the end of the fourth and seventh contract years.andP;  GSA also expectsto change the two vendors' shares if a change is warranted.andM;With the protests, the procurement has again been plunged into controversy,which has dogged the FTS 2000 program for years.andP;  This latest brouhaha,however, may be short-lived.andM;GSBCA Judge Vincent LaBella said at a recent hearing the MCI protest &quot;doesn'tseem very complicated,&quot; and it should not take more than a day to decidewhether the company legally has a right to challenge the ATandamp;T contract.andM;Both MCI and Martin Marietta are keying in on whether the ATandamp;T tariff meetsall the conditions of the GSA solicitation.andP;  They said the tariff does notcomply with certain RFP clauses requiring that the government be protectedfor any price changes for ATandamp;T's services, nor does it prevent ATandamp;T frompassing on to its shareholders some of the costs of those services.andM;MCI also has told the FCC that to keep ATandamp;T's pricing structure secret would&quot;deprive the public of the opportunity to participate fully and effectivelyin the tariff review process.&quot;andP;  But Mackichan, in comments filed with thecommission, said &quot;maintaining the confidentiality of contract prices in allforums is essential to the continued success of the FTS 2000 project.&quot;andM;However, the GSA official's strongest comments were directed against MCI,when he questioned the company's right to come before the GSA panel.andM;Mackichan said cancellation of the ATandamp;T pact and a clarification of thegovernment's tariff-related requirements would not benefit MCI because thecompany did not bid on the contract and was only a Martin Marietta teammember.andP;  &quot;MCI is not next in line for award.andP;  MCI is not further down theline.andP;  MCI is not even in line,&quot; the GSA general counsel said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
