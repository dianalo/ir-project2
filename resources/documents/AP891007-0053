About 1,000 anti-government dissidents staged a peaceful protestat a Seoul college campus to urge the pope to speak out on allegedhuman rights abuses in South Korea. Some 1,000 riot policesurrounded the campus but made no move to halt the protest.   John Paul arrived in Seoul after flying across the Soviet Unionfor the first time and sending greetings by radio to SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev in a sign of recently improvedVatican-Soviet relations. The pope expressed hope he would soonvisit Moscow.   After being greeted with a bugle and drum fanfare byscarlet-clad bandsman and young women in traditional silk dresseswaving white and yellow papal flags, the pope immediately took upthe issue of Korean reunification that has divided the influentialCatholic community in South Korea.   Addressing himself to the ``dear people of Korea'' John Paulsaid:   ``In the face of the tragic division which continues to separateyour own people, do you not have the urgent mission to prove to aworld torn by mistrust, strife and hatred that mankind does havethe resources to end division and war, and to forge an enduringpeace?''   ``Those resources are yours: the spiritual values of mutualtrust and reconciliation, of selfless generosity and brotherlylove,'' he said.   The Korean peninsula, divided in 1945, is the site of one of theworld's most bitter ideological confrontations, with the capitalistSouth locked in a struggle for domination with the totalitarianNorth. The two sides, who fought to a bloody stalemate in the1950-53 Korean War, frequently clash and maintain huge armies alongtheir narrow 150-mile border.   North and South Korea are still technically at war since nopeace treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953.   ``You yourselves are witnesses of the painful divisions thataffect your own people,'' he said. ``You are searching for asolution.''   A heated debate broke out in the Catholic community after adissident priest visited North Korea in July to escort home aradical college student. The two claimed the trip was to promoteunification, but the Seoul government called it an illegal contactwith an enemy state.   The priest and student were arrested when they crossed backacross the border. Three other priests were jailed for organizingthe priest's trip without government approval.   Security was extremely tight today with hundreds of police andsecurity agents guarding the pope. Worshipers attending a Massgiven by the pope at a Seoul church had to pass through metaldetectors and other searches and police guarded surrounding streets.   The dissidents who held a peaceful protest at Sogang Universityurged the pope to denounce the government of President Roh Tae-woofor what they said were human rights abuses. Protesters applaudedas a student leader said the government's claims to have introduceddemocracy were false.   But most South Koreans agree there have been major politicalreforms, and the dissidents have little public support.   In later remarks, during a Mass in a gymnastics hall where the1988 Olympic Games were staged, the pope urged young people toreject violence and hatred. South Korea's radicals have beencriticized for their willingness to stage violent protests.   After South Korea, the pope goes on to Indonesia and acontroversial stop in East Timor, and then to the Indian Oceanisland nation of Mauritius before returning to Rome Oct. 16.   The trip is the Polish-born pope's 44th foreign pilgrimage andthe first time he flew over Soviet territory. Alitalia, the Italianairline that provided the pope's jumbo jet, first sought to flyover China.   But when Beijing's Communist government refused, the airlinereceived permission from Moscow.   As the Boeing 747 flew over the Soviet capital, the pilotradioed a message from the pope to the Kremlin, said Vaticanspokesman Joaquin Navarro.   Addressed to Gorbachev, the leader of a party which hashistorically disparaged religion, the message from the leader ofthe world's 850 million Roman Catholics said:   ``Flying over the territory of the Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics on my way to a pastoral visit to several Asian countries,I want to greet your excellency and assure you of my best wishesfor the wellbeing and prosperity of your fellow citizens.''</TEXT></DOC>
