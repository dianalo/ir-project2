Law later called it ``a wonderful thing.''   The cardinal, a personal friend of Bush's, said he offered aprayer before the private lunch with the president, chief of staffJohn Sununu and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.   Law said they discussed not only ``the terrible situation of thehostages,'' but ``the broader issue of Lebanon.''   ``The hostage situation has to be seen in the context of thequestion of Lebanon as a whole,'' said Law, who expressed hope fora revival of the Arab League efforts to end the factional strifeand provide ``greater integrity of territory for the Lebanese.''   Law said that in the past, Christians and Moslems ``have beenable to forge out a very unique kind of political experiment ...(and) live together in a political system that really was a model''in Lebanon.   Law noted that large numbers of Christians are fleeing Beirutbecause of the shelling there and said, ``if there isn't quicklysome resolution to the Lebanese situation ... then one woulddespair of that Christian presence.''   Reporters asked the cardinal if he was optimistic about Bush'sdiplomatic efforts to end the hostage crisis.   ``I'm in the business of hope, I'm in the business ofconversion, so I'm never ready to assume that the status quo isit,'' Law replied with a smile.   Law said Bush had tentatively agreed to visit Boston Sept. 23 tospeak at a gathering of Catholic lawyers and judges.   He said they also discussed events in Central America and Cuba,a country Law has visited several times.   Law said that despite recent arrests of human rights activistsin Cuba, he has seen progress in the communist island in the pastfive years toward wider freedom.   ``It does seem to me that Cuba, given its geographic location,very naturally ought to be in good relationship with the UnitedStates,'' said the cardinal.</TEXT></DOC>
