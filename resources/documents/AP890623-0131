Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., the committee chairman; and WilliamCohen, R-Maine, the ranking minority member, said the ``head ofstate'' file held three 1985 documents detailing an administrationplan to slip an extra $110 million in aid to Honduras if thatcountry would support the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   President Reagan initialed his approval for the arrangement onone of the documents, which were all originals.   The three documents weren't turned over to the congressionalIran-Contra committees. Copies of the documents found in theNational Security Council files of Oliver North were first disclosedthis year at North's trial stemming from the Iran-Contra affair.   At a news conference, Boren and Cohen said the intelligencecommittee found no evidence in an investigation to suggest that ahalf-dozen documents, including those found in the head of statefiles, had been systematically withheld by the White House.   In a 51-page report, the committee concluded that ``anysystematic effort by the White House to prevent their production''to Congress ``would have been difficult to accomplish.''   It added that the committee ``cannot, however, absolutely ruleout the possibility that selective efforts could have been made ...to remove certain copies of the documents.''   The report attributed the failure to produce the documents toCongress ``most likely ... to the mistaken, but good-faithjudgment'' of FBI agents conducting a search for them in connectionwith the criminal investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal.   The report also said the committee was ``unable to explain withcertainty'' why an Oct. 30, 1985 White House document dealing withairdropping recoilless rifles to the Contras didn't come to theattention of Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
