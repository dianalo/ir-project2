The dollar rose against most of the major currencies in thin trading.    The Culture Day holiday in Japan, which closed Tokyo trading, also cut into market activity. There was no sign of the central banks in the market yesterday following three days of intervention.    In the light market activity, profit-taking and position-squaring during New York trading pushed the dollar above Wednesday's levels against the mark, sterling and the yen.    Despite the U.S. currency's strength, the Australian dollar tested a four-month high, at 82.90 U.S. cents in Australasian trading, and then continued rising to break the 83.00 cents level, the highest the Australian dollar has been since October 1984, according to John J. Ward, senior foreign exchange trader with the Bank of New Zealand. The Australian dollar was quoted late in New York trading at 83.11 cents.    In late trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7789 marks, up from 1.7733 marks late Wednesday, and at 124.58 yen, up from 124.28 yen. Sterling fell to $1.7768, from 1.7815 late Wednesday.    In Tokyo Friday, the dollar opened for trading at 124.72 yen.    After three consecutive days of central bank intervention, some traders said the market was reluctant to try to push the dollar lower yesterday without the liquidity of the Japanese traders behind it.    &quot;Fed intervention has been pretty significant this week,&quot; said a New York trader. &quot;People think they will be pretty aggressive about supporting the dollar and that has scared people from putting any more pressure on the dollar than they did today {Thursday}.&quot;    Traders will be watching the employment data carefully for clues on the future course of the U.S. economy.    &quot;We expect to see basically a growth in employment by 235,000 {non-farm payroll} jobs, slightly slower than last month. In essence, that would not support suppositions that the economy is slowing down remarkably,&quot; said John Lipsky, an economist and vice president with Salomon Brothers Inc. Mr. Lipsky predicted the unemployment rate will probably remain unchanged at 5.4% in October.    With market expectations for the non-farm payroll jobs ranging from 230,000 new jobs to 250,000 new jobs, traders have mixed opinions whether a number within this range would give the dollar a boost.    &quot;Maybe the dollar would find some support,&quot; said Frank Marsico, a trader with Banco Nazionale de Lavoro in New York. &quot;They won't sell the dollar initially on those numbers.&quot;    A second New York trader said he expected the non-farm payroll increase to be reported at 230,000 new jobs and such a number &quot;would be very positive for the dollar.&quot;    The second big consideration for traders is the U.S. election, and although they expect Republican candidate George Bush will win over Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis, they note that the fundamental trend of the dollar will likely remain downward no matter who becomes president.    &quot;There will be a mini-rally after the election because the uncertainty will be gone,&quot; said Axel Coym, manager of foreign exchange at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York. &quot;After the election, we will know there won't be any surprises and so there will be a rally of a few percentage points. But overall, the direction will be down for the dollar.&quot;    On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $421.50 an ounce, down 30 cents. Estimated volume was a moderate 4.2 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Friday, gold was quoted at $420.80 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
