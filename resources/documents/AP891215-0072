Sakharov, the brilliant physicist whobuilt the Soviet hydrogen bomb and became an unwavering beacon forthe world in the cause of human rights, has died at age 68.   The 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner died alone in his studyThursday night of an apparent heart attack, said his son-in-law,Yefrem Yankelevich. Sakharov died as he had lived the last twodecades of his life, struggling for democracy, world peace andhuman liberty.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who freed Sakharov from nearlyseven years of internal exile but clashed with him repeatedly overthe scale and speed of new Soviet political reforms, mourned thedeath as ``a great loss.''   ``He was a man of conviction and sincerity,'' Gorbachev said.``He was not some sort of political intriguer. He was a person whohad his own ideas, his own convictions which he expressed openlyand directly. This doesn't mean I agreed with him, although on manythings we did agree.''   Sakharov risked his status as a national scientific hero and thehonors the Soviet Union had heaped upon him to openly challenge thegovernment when most others were silent. He was vilified, attackedby the authorities and banished from Moscow in 1980. The exilesapped his vitality and undermined his health.   After he was freed by Gorbachev three years ago, he won a seatin the Soviet Congress. He used it as a forum to press for reformand freedom in his country, gaining new stature as a conscience ofthe nation.   Tributes to the brave humanist came from around the world.   Sakharov's death occurred after a long day of struggle toorganize an opposition to the Communist Party. He was preparing aspeech demanding that the Communists' guaranteed hold on power berevoked, Yankelevich said.   The defiant activist's final words to his family were:``Tomorrow there will be battle,'' Yankelevich said.   Sergei Kovalev, a fellow human rights activist in Moscow and afriend, said the body was found by Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner.Bonner was his full partner in their human rights campaigns thatembraced any cause, fought any injustice and gave strength andcourage to victims and to those who wanted to reform the SovietUnion.   Bonner, his strength and his companion during the years ofstruggle and exile, sat in a chair next to the body. A few closefriends were admitted to the apartment, said a friend who spoke oncondition he not be identified.   Just hours before he died, Sakharov stood on the floor of theCongress of People's Deputies and demanded that oppositiondelegates form an alternative party to the Communists.   He told his fellow opposition congressmen that Gorbachev and theCommunist Party leadership were ``leading the country tocatastrophe, prolonging the process of perestroika many years.''   It was the latest call in his final cause: to end seven decadesof guaranteed Communist supremacy.   The 2,250-seat Congress formed a committee to organizeSakharov's funeral, and Gorbachev said he and the entire body willattend. At his own request, Sakharov will be buried alongside hisparents Monday at Vostryakovskoe Cemetery on the southwestern edgeof Moscow, said a scientific secretary at the Lebedev PhysicsInstitute where Sakharov worked.   Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, a member of the Presidium of the Congress,opened today's session with an announcement of the death of one ofthe chamber's best-known deputies, a man who was officiallyvilified for decades.   He paid tribute to Sakharov both as a scientist and publicfigure.   ``All that he did was dictated by his sleepless conscience, hisdeep humanitarian convictions,'' said Vorotnikov, a member of theCommunist Party Politburo and president of the Russian Federation.   Gorbachev joined the Congress in standing for a moment ofsilence out of respect for the Congress member.   Dmitri Likhachev, another scholar-deputy, told the chamber:``With Sakharov, a part of our heart has departed from us.''   Yankelevich told reporters at the apartment that hisfather-in-law ``died last night of what the doctors say was a heartattack. We don't exactly know the cause of death yet.''   Yankelevich said Sakharov had left his apartment about 9 p.m. togo downstairs to another apartment in the same building, where hehad a study crammed with books and papers from his scientific andpolitical careers.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
