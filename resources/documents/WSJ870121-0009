The cargo trailers, plastic containers and restaurant concern said operating profit and sales will increase for its Sewell Plastics operations and its Bickford's Family Fare restaurant operations, both for the fourth quarter and the year.    However, the company's Dorsey Trailers operations will report an operating loss and a decline in earnings and sales for the quarter and year.    In addition, fourth-quarter and yearly earnings will be reduced by 12 cents to 15 cents a share because of a fourth-quarter loss of investment tax credits mandated by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.    In the nine months, Dorsey had earnings $8.6 million, or $1.23 a share, on revenue of $398.9 million.    Dorsey said it previously indicated that it entered into a letter of intent with private investors for the sale of substantially all the assets of its Dorsey Trailers unit through a leveraged buyout. In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    In the 1985 fourth quarter, Dorsey had earnings of $3.2 million, or 95 cents a share, on revenue of $130.3 million. For all 1985, Dorsey earned $10.4 million, or $3.21 a share, on revenue of $532.2 million.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Dorsey closed at $23.375, down 87.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
