The ROD was prepared in accordance with Council on EnvironmentalQuality Regulations, 40 CFR 1505.2. The decision of the Fish and WildlifeService is based on information contained in: The Final Environmental ImpactStatement (FEIS) which was filed with the Environmental Protection Agencyin May, 1987 and became available to the public on May 20, 1987; otherpertinent scientific and technical data; and public comments received onthe proposal. The ROD selects the Proposed Action as the best alternativefor a master plan to manage the Refuge for the next 10 to 20 years.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Curtis Laffin, U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, One Gateway Center, Newton Corner, Massachusetts 02158,(617) 965-5100 ext. 222.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)manages national wildlife refuges to meet the major purpose(s) for whichthey were established. The public is provided opportunities to enjoy naturalresources found on refuges. These uses must be compatible with the purposesfor which each refuge is established. Refuges are periodically analyzedto establish long-range objectives and strategies for accomplishing thoseobjectives. Great Swamp NWR has been planned through such a process. Thisrefuge was established in 1960 through the efforts of concerned citizenswho raised funds to acquire and protect 3000 acres of important New Jerseywetland-upland habitat for migratory birds, other indigenous wildlife andtheir habitats. Acquisition has primarily been for migratory waterfowland wildlife oriented recreation purposes. In addition Congress establisheda 3660 acre wilderness area at Great Swamp NWR in 1968. The Proposed ActionAlternative selected in this ROD takes into account the significant amountof land development that has occurred in the Great Swamp watershed in recentyears. Development has greatly altered the watershed and so disrupted surfacewater runoff that the Refuge habitats have been adversely affected by wetterwet periods and dryer dry periods. Increased development has also broughtmore people closer to the Refuge, thereby greatly increasing demand forpublic use activities on the Refuge.The Proposed Action Alternative addresses these and other pressures onRefuge habitats and wildlife and establishes management strategies to copewith them.<ITAG tagnum="84">Alternatives Considered</ITAG>The following four alternative master plans were considered in reachinga decision:No Action AlternativeProvides for toxic waste clean-up on currently owned Refuge lands; precludesacquisition of other land containing toxic dump sites, and continues currentmanagement practices, outputs, and public use activities. Habitat and wildlifepopulation protection, the annual deer hunt, water management in the Refuge'sfive impoundments, management of upland field and forest habitat, maintenanceof climax forest, wildlife surveys, and bird banding would continue atcurrent levels. Existing facilities, including parking lots, restrooms,boardwalk trails, an observation tower and an observation blind will bemaintained. Pleasant Plains Road will be maintained as a gravel road opento through traffic. Public use activities such as birding and other wildlifeobservation, interpretation, wildlife education and fruit picking willcontinue at present levels. Great Swamp's present permanent staff of ninewill continue to operate from the existing headquarters/maintenance complex.Proposed Action AlternativeMajor changes from current conditions include: Acquisition of land outsidethe presently approved acquisition boundary to prevent further encroachmentand development of wetlands and critical upland edge habitats having highwildlife value and to prevent encroachment on and degradation of existingRefuge land.Updating of a 1982-1984 hydrology study to determine the combination ofwater control modifications required to properly regulate water levelsin Pools 1 and 2 and Middle Brook Pool.Reversion of up to 1,000 acres of red maple dominated habitat to more diverse,earlier successional habitat types that will be more productive of wildlife,especially woodcock.Regulation of public use in the Wilderness Area to assure it is managedto maintain its wilderness qualities.Establishment of a trapping program to be instituted as needed to reduceexcessive raccoon predation on nesting birds and other wildlife. Increasedproduction of black duck, American woodcock, wood duck, red-shoulderedhawk, bluebird and other sensitive species to meet Refuge wildlife productionobjectives.Upgrading and expanding the public use program through the constructionof a wildlife interpretive center, improvement of the existing trail system,construction of a self-guided interpretive trail, and construction of twovisitor information kiosks and one wildlife observation blind. Taking actionto minimize the negative effects of development within the watershed thatthreaten the ecological balance of the swamp through increased runoff,sedimentation and water pollution.Public Use AlternativeThis alternative expands options of public access, and for wildlife educationand interpretation, while maintaining wildlife habitat diversity throughmoderate management activities. Unique features include canoeing, fishing,horseback riding trails, additional visitor contact points and 79 additionalparking spaces. Land acquisition would include floodplains of some streamswhich flow into the Refuge. Self-guided trails and the connection of theRefuge trail system to adjacent county environmental centers will favorrelations between the Refuge and local communities.Wildlife Management AlternativeThis alternative closes Pleasant Plains Road to through traffic and intensifiesmost wildlife management activities, especially for woodcock and waterfowl.Raccoon control will be implemented. Major management changes include acquisitionof land prone to flooding and intensified woodcock habitat management toback succession stages of upland habitat.<ITAG tagnum="84">Basis for the Decision</ITAG>The Proposed Action alternative meets refuge purposes in a comprehensivemanner and minimizes the environmental, social and economic impacts asmuch as is practicable. An exhaustive public participation process identifiedconcerns of interested parties and brought about plan modifications thatsubstantially resolved controversial issues related to items such as roadabandonment and closures, trapping, animal control, hunting, controlledburning, woodcock management and public use facilities. Continued publicparticipation during project implementation will further reduce real orperceived impacts on social and natural resources. Measures to minimizeimpacts of the selected alternative are identified in this document andthe FEIS.The Proposed Action most effectively balances habitat protection, wildlifepopulation management and public use opportunities to maximize the potentialfor Refuge benefits. Land acquisition will be expanded to acquire, fromwilling sellers, tracts of good wildlife habitat that have not been degradedby development. Acquisition of additional wetland and upland adjacent towetland will also reduce the amount of private land that currently floodsdue to accelerated surface water runoff brought on by watershed development.In response to alteration of surface water runoff patterns, the ProposedAction includes updating the 1982-1984 hydrology study that accesses theeffects of altered flows on Refuge water regimes.This alternative includes action to control public use in the wildernessarea while monitoring changes more closely to ensure that action can betaken to curb threats to the area's wilderness qualities.The proposal to control the excessive raccoon population through trappingwas opposed by many individuals and groups in their responses to the DraftEIS. However, no feasible alternative to reducing raccoon predation onnesting birds and other wildlife was presented. The adverse impact on wildlifeproduction caused by raccoons is unacceptable so the trapping program willbe developed. A similar situation exists with the annual deer hunt. Ifnot controlled, the deer population will rapidly expand causing starvation,disease and damage to wildlife habitat and to other species. Browsing onneighboring crops and ornamental plants would increase as would the numbersof road-killed deer. The hunt will continue because there is no feasiblealternative to maintain the herd at numbers compatible with available habitat.Consistent with implementation of wildlife management actions, this alternativeimproves the quality of public use programs while minimizing conflictswith wildlife. The other alternatives do not provide an acceptable balancebetween wildlife and public use management.The selected alternative responds to the concern that more communicationis needed between the Refuge and its ``neighbors.'' A FWS person has beenassigned to work closely with the Refuge to expand communication with surroundingcommunities.The FWS considers the Proposed Action as the Preferred Alternative sinceit will best achieve the effective management of the Great Swamp NWR.<ITAG tagnum="84">Terms and Conditions for Implementing Decision</ITAG>The FWS will implement the Proposed Action alternative by phasing in specificactions through annual budget development as funding allows. Implementationof highly controversial actions such as trapping and controlled burningwill be preceded by appropriate public review.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusions</ITAG>Based on a careful review and consideration of National Wildlife RefugeSystem Laws and Policies, the EIS and public comments, and other relevantfactors, I am selecting the Proposed Action as the best alternative forthe long-term management of the Great Swamp NWR.<ITAG tagnum="6">Dale T.
