The report by the congressional Office of Technology Assessmentsaid ``today's classrooms typically resemble their ancestors of 50years ago more closely than operating rooms or business officesresemble their 1938 versions.''   The agency estimated that schools have spent $2 billion oncomputer hardware over the past decade. There are now 1.2 millionto 1.7 million computers in public schools, and fewer than 5percent have no computers.   But the agency said it would cost $4 billion to buy enoughequipment to reduce the student-computer ratio from 30-1 to 3-1.   The 246-page report, based on two years' research, said thatbetween 1981 and 1987 the percentage of schools equipped withcomputers for instructional use grew from 18 percent to 95 percent.   But ``the vast majority of schools still do not have enough ofthem to make the computer a central element of instruction,'' itsaid.   Computers are not the only new machines in American classrooms.   ``The 1980s witnessed a tremendous expansion in school use ofadvanced technology of all types,'' the report said.   ``In 1980 very few schools had videocassette recorders. Todayroughly 90 percent do,'' it said, adding that the availability ofcable and satellite transmission has made the television a morepotent teaching tool _ especially for schools in remote areas.   ``In practice there is wide disparity _ one computer in aclassroom, clusters of computers in the library or classrooms, fullcomputer laboratories and classrooms with no computers,'' it said.``Not all students use computers and ... those who do spend onaverage a little more than one hour per week on the computer.''   The report said that ``although new interactive technologiescannot alone solve the problems of American education, they havealready contributed to important improvements in learning. Thesetools can plan an even greater role ... both by helping childrenacquire basic skills and by endowing them with more sophisticatedskills so they can acquire and apply knowledge over theirlifetimes.''   To tap the potential of technology, the report said, ``a greaterinvestment will be necessary,'' including a more active federalrole in spurring research and helping spread the new teaching tools.   The report warned that ``the vast majority of those now teachingor planning to teach have had little or no computer education ortraining.'' Most of what they have been taught is to how to usecomputers themselves, not how to teach with computers.   ``Despite a nationwide call to improve teaching, there is almostno federal money for the training of new teachers,'' it said.   It said there are more than 10,000 educational software productson the market, but the quality ``could be much better.''   The Office of Technology Assessment is a nonpartisan analyticalagency for Congress.   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the HouseCommittee on Education and Labor, which commissioned the study,said increasing federal support for high-tech school aids ``wouldbe good public policy and a wise investment for the future.''   The report cited several examples of schools putting computersand other gear to good use, including:   _Poteet High School in Mesquite, Texas, where interactivevideodiscs are used throughout the physical science curriculum,allowing ninth graders to bring a volcanic eruption or solar flareto life at the touch of a computer keyboard.   _Sacred Heart Model School in Louisville, Ky., where fifthgraders recently assembled a computer database of their pets(including 25 dogs, 4 hermit crabs and 1 guinea pig) and arecurrently testing the acidity of the city's tap water for acomparison with data from 199 other schools around the world.</TEXT></DOC>
