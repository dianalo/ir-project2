Yang and David ShribmanStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><TEXT>   Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn ended months of speculation by saying he won't seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988, despite the urgings of conservative party leaders.    Mr. Nunn's decision removes one of the last areas of uncertainty in the Democratic presidential campaign and appears to set the contours for the contest.    In a letter to supporters, Mr. Nunn said his position as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee foreclosed a run for the White House. &quot;If I attempted to run for president and also carry out my Senate duties, I would wind up doing neither well,&quot; he wrote. Mr. Nunn also expressed concern about &quot;the impact of a presidential campaign on my family.&quot;    Mr. Nunn's supporters believe a run for the White House was &quot;something that could be accomplished,&quot; according to Gordon Giffin, an Atlanta attorney and close Nunn adviser. &quot;It just became a question of whether he wanted to pursue it.&quot;    Mr. Nunn, a classic conservative Southern Democrat and a leading voice on defense issues, had been cast as a presidential contender capable of capturing the South for the Democrats and ending the perception that the party is weak on defense.    But those same attributes would have presented substantial hurdles to winning his party's nomination. A number of Mr. Nunn's positions, including his opposition to abortion and support for aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, would have given him trouble with the liberal Democratic activists who have a substantial role in determining their party's standardbearer.    &quot;Sam Nunn could have been the savior of the national Democratic party,&quot; said Claibourne Darden, an Atlanta polltaker who has done work for Mr. Nunn, &quot;but it's pretty speculative if he could have won the nomination.&quot;    Southern party leaders created next year's &quot;Super Tuesday,&quot; when more than a dozen states in the region will hold primaries and caucuses, with an eye toward increasing the region's importance in the nominating process. Now two principal potential beneficiaries, Mr. Nunn and former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, have both declined to run.    In the current field of candidates, only Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. can lay claim to the South, though he grew up in Washington while his father served in the Senate. Mr. Nunn's decision &quot;halfway opens the door for&quot; Mr. Gore, said Mr. Darden. &quot;Now we need to see if he's capable of taking advantage of it.&quot;    At a news conference in Atlanta yesterday, Mr. Nunn said that no candidate had yet emerged &quot;with the expression of the kind of philosophy and the kind of values that the people of the South are looking for.&quot;    Mr. Nunn's announcement frees many Southern politicians and party activists -- and their money -- who had been awaiting his decision before deciding whom to support. Fred Martin, head of Mr. Gore's campaign, said he has already begun hearing from some who had hoped Mr. Nunn would run. &quot;This news has to benefit Al Gore's candidacy,&quot; he said.    Sen. Nunn's decision not to run also could benefit Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who are generally regarded as the leading contenders. Privately, aides to Mr. Dukakis said they regarded Mr. Nunn as a candidate people could easily envision as president and that his withdrawal now, as people begin seriously to consider Mr. Dukakis in that role, is an advantage.    There are six declared candidates for the Democratic nomination: Gov. Dukakis, Rep. Gephardt, Sen. Gore, former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon.    Rev. Jesse Jackson is expected to enter the race and Colorado Rep. Patricia Schroeder is considering running as well. Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste ended speculation earlier this week by saying he wouldn't run.    &quot;Anybody who's going to run is either in,&quot; said Greg Schneiders, a political consultant associated with Mr. Babbitt, &quot;or has said they'll be in.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
