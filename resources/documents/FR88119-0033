W.

L. 99-570), the fee guidelines issued by the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB), and the fee waiver criteria published by the Departmentof Justice.To comply with the OMB guidelines, the Committee is proposing to amend41 CFR Part 51-7 to provide for the collection of fees for the provisionof document search, duplication, and review services; for the handlingof requests from various categories of requesters; for the circumstancesunder which fees shall and shall not be charged; for the advance collectionof fees; for the assessment of interest on requests for which fees havenot been paid; and for the effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 onFOIA requests. The fees set forth in the proposed rule are based upon theguidelines prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) publishedat 52 FR 10012 (March 27, 1987). It is also proposed to include procedurespertaining to the preservation of agency records under the FOIA.This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' within the meaning of ExecutiveOrder No. 12291 (Improving Government Regulations). Nor will these regulationscause a significant economic impact or other substantial effect on smallentities. Therefore, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,5 U.S.C. 606(b), do not apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 41 CFR Part 51-7</ITAG>Freedom of InformationIt is proposed to revise 41 CFR Part 51-7 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">51-7 PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF AGENCY MATERIALS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.1 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.2 Scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.3 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.4 Availability of materials.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.5 Requests for records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.6 Aggregating requests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.7 Committee response to requests for records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.8 Business information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.9 Records of other agencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.10 Appeals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.11 Extensions of time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.12 Fee schedule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.13 Fees charged by category of requester.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.14 Fee waivers and reductions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.15 Collection of fees and charges.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">51-7.16 Preservation of records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 552</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 51-7.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose.</ITAG>These regulations implement the provisions of the ``Freedom of InformationAct,'' 5 U.S.C. 552.

The Act prescribesspecific levels of fees for each category.(b) Commercial use requesters_For commercial use requesters, the Committeeshall assess charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for,reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Commercial userequesters are not entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 freepages of reproduction of documents referenced in andSection; 51-7.12(c)(1).The Committee may charge for the cost of searching for and reviewing recordsfor commercial use requesters even if there is ultimately no disclosureof records.(1) A commercial use requester is defined as one who seeks informationfor a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interestsof the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.   (2) In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this categorythe Committee must determine whether the requester will put the documentsto a commercial use. Where the Committee has reasonable cause to doubtthe use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where thatuse is not clear from the request itself, the Committee may seek additionalclarification from the requester.   (c) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters_Feesfor this category of requesters shall be limited to the cost of providingduplication service alone, minus the charge for the first 100 reproducedpages. No charge shall be made for search or review services. To qualifyfor this category, requesters must show that the request is being madeas authorized by and under the auspices of an eligible institution andthat the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought infurtherance of scholarly research (if the request is from a non-commercialscientific institution).   (1) The term ``educational institution'' refers to a preschool, a publicor private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate highereducation, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institutionof professional education, and an institution of vocational education,which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.   (2) The term ``non-commercial scientific institution'' refers to an institutionthat is not operated on a ``commerical'' basis, and which is operated solelyfor the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of whichare not intended to promote any particular product or industry.   (d) Requesters who are representatives of the news media_Fees for thiscategory of requesters shall also be limited to the cost of providing duplicationservice alone, minus the charge for the first 100 reproduced pages. Nocharge shall be made for providing search for review services. Requestsin this category must not be made for a commercial use.   (1) The term ``representative of the news media'' refers to any personactively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated topublish or broadcast to the public.   (2) The term ``news'' means information that is about current events orthat would be of current interest to the public.   (3) Examples of news media entities include television or radio stationsbroadcasting to the public at large, and publishers or periodicals whichdisseminate news and who make their products available for purchase orsubscription by the general public.   (4) ``Freelance'' journalists may be regarded as working for a news organizationif they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication throughthat organization even though not actually employed by it.   (e) All other requesters-Fees for requesters who do not fit into any ofthe above categories shall be assessed for the full reasonable direct costof searching for and duplicating documents that are responsive to a request,except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hoursof search time shall be furnished without charge.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 51-7.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fee waivers and reductions.   </ITAG>The Committee will waive or reduce fees on requests for information ifdisclosure of the information is deemed to be in the public interest becauseit is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of theoperations or activities of the Government, and is not primarily in thecommercial interest of the requester.   (a) In determining when fees shall be waived or reduced, the Committeewill consider the following six factors:   (1) The subject of the request, i.e., whether the subject of the requestedrecords concerns ``the operations or activities of the government'';  (2) The informative value of the information to be disclosed, i.e., whetherthe disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding of Governmentoperations or activities:   (3) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the generalpublic likely to result from disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure of therequested information will contribute to ``public understanding'';   (4) The significance of the contribution to public understanding, i.e.,whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to publicunderstanding of government operations or activites;(5) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest, i.e., whetherthe requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by therequested disclosure; and, if so,   (6) The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether the magnitude ofthe identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large,in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''   (b) The Committee may waiver or reduce fees associated with a request fordisclosure regardless of whether a waiver or reduction has been requestedin the Committee determines that disclosure will primarily benefit thegeneral public.   (c) Fees shall be waived, however, without discretion in all circumstanceswhere the amount of the fee is $20.00 or less.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 51-7.15</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Collection of fees and charges.   </ITAG>(a) Except when prepayment is required, payments shall be collected tothe fullest extent possible at the time the requested materials are furnished.Payments shall be made by requesters within 30 days of the date of thebilling.   (b) Payments shall be made by check, draft, or money order made payableto the Treasury of the United States.   (c) In instances where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee,the Committee may require the requester to pay the full amount owed, plusany applicable interest as provided below, as well as the full estimatedfee associated with any new request before it begins to process the newor subsequent request.(d) On requests that result in fees being assessed, interest will be chargedon an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which thebilling was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717of Title 31 U.S.C., and will accrue from the date of the billing.   (e) In attempting to collect fees levied under FOIA, the Committee willabide by the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365)in disclosing information to consumer reporting agencies and in the useof collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage payment.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 51-7.16</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Preservation of records.   </ITAG>The Committee shall preserve all correspondence relating to the requestsit receives under this part, and all records processed pursuant to suchrequests, until such time as the destruction of such correspondence andrecords is authorized pursuant to Title 44 of the United States Code, andto the General Records Schedule.
