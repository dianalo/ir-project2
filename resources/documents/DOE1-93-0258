Both reviewof the literature and laboratory research were conducted. Transfer-efficiencymeasurement methods presently used by industry were evaluated and compared.The best characteristics of these methods were incorporated into thefinal proposed standard method. The resulting method was determined tobe viable for laboratory evaluations. It still awaits adaptation andverification for production-line applications.</TEXT></DOC>
