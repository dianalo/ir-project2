Heeding his word, according to the joke, the bank hasn't done anything since. Once that joke had a biting element of truth to it, but no longer.    Friday, Bank of New York initiated a hostile $1.4 billion offer for New York-based Irving Bank Corp. and broke the industry's unwritten gentlemen's code of conduct that bankers have adhered to for generations.    By tradition, bankers have shunned unsolicited or hostile mergers because they have long assumed that a takeover fight would damage customer confidence in an institution's strength. Michael Horn of Ryan, Beck andamp; Co., an investment banker, says, &quot;The unwritten code says institutions just don't do that to one another. It's not considered gentlemanly.&quot;    Polite or not, hostile offers for financial institutions will become more commonplace as banks and thrifts adapt to a new economic landscape, many say. Not only are they merging at a furious pace, but banks and thrifts are experimenting with new financial products and facing new types of competitors like Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. and Ford Motor Co. And they are having to compete in an industry that has seen its profitability erode seriously in recent years as a result of bad loans to developing countries, competition from the commercial paper market and loans to the depressed domestic energy industry.    Eric Gleacher, head of mergers and acquisitions for Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., the adviser to Bank of New York, predicts that the offer &quot;is a precursor of more things to come.&quot; Bank of New York is offering $80 a share for 47.4% of Irving's shares and 1.9 shares of Bank of New York common stock per share for the remainder of Irving shares. Irving has about 18 million shares outstanding.    Edward Furash, a Washington, D.C., consultant to financial institutions, adds: &quot;There is a vast audience out there waiting with baited breath for the outcome of this. If Bank of New York does get control of Irving, not only will there be more hostile offers but managements that have rejected mergers in the past will be more likely to accept unsolicited ones.&quot;    Bank of New York's bid, which would create the nation's 11th-largest bank, is only the latest action that shows how bankers are being forced to go against the grain of their traditional way of conducting business.    The most notable example of this breakdown in collegiality came in May when Citicorp Chairman John S. Reed broke ranks with his peers and unilaterally added $3 billion to loan-loss reserves for debt to troubled countries. More recently, some bankers expressed dismay when Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and Bankers Trust New York Corp. sought to beat Citicorp to the equity markets with common stock offerings to bolster balance sheets sapped by loan-loss reserves.    And as unusual as a hostile offer for a bank is, it is even rarer for shareholders to get a chance to tender their stock. In trading Friday, investors, reacting warmly to the offer, bid up the stocks of both banks. Irving stock rose $25.875 to close at $78.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Bank of New York stock rose $1.50 to close at $43.375, also in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    While the Bank of New York's bid for Irving isn't the first hostile attempt to take over a financial institution, it will be especially noteworthy if it succeeds. So far, the record hasn't been encouraging: In 1986, First Interstate Bancorp stopped short of waging a hostile takeover of BankAmerica Corp. after its $3.39 billion offer was spurned. Earlier this summer, Banc One Corp., Columbus, Ohio, emerged as a friendly suitor to save Milwaukee-based Marine Corp. from a higher bid by another Milwaukee bank holding company, Marshall andamp; Ilsley Corp. In Britain, Lloyds Bank PLC last year made an abortive bid for Standard Chartered PLC.    It would be difficult to imagine a more unlikely pair of banks to become embroiled in a hostile takeover attempt that has trend-setting overtones for the entire industry. Both Irving and Bank of New York are venerable names in the history of U.S. banking that today live in the shadows of the more aggressive New York banks.    Few banks dwell on their heritage as much as Bank of New York. Founded in 1784 by Mr. Hamilton, Bank of New York is the oldest in that state and the oldest in the nation still doing business under the same name. The sense of tradition carries over even into the federal style of architecture that results in many of Bank of New York's branches looking like Colonial brick homes.    Indeed, until J. Carter Bacot took over as chairman and chief executive officer in 1982, many bankers regarded Bank of New York as a sleepy backwater that had seen its heyday.    That changed with Mr. Bacot's appointment. Mr. Bacot, 54 years old, towers 6 feet 4 inches tall with piercing eyes and the mien of &quot;Dragnet's&quot; Jack Webb. A native of Utica, N.Y., he joined Bank of New York in 1960, two years after graduating from Cornell Law School. Acquaintances describe him as unsentimental, hard-nosed and a maverick among New York bank executives. One banker likened him to another banking maverick, Joseph Pinola, the chairman of Los Angeles-based First Interstate.    Since becoming chairman, Mr. Bacot has pursued an aggressive course. He led the bank to drop out of the upstate New York market to concentrate on the affluent suburbs of New York City. As part of the strategy, the bank last year bought North American Bancorp Inc., parent of Long Island Trust Co., for $300 million in cash and notes. It also retains an agreement to buy Northeast Bancorp., a Connecticut-based bank holding company, should that state allow acquisitions there by New York banks.    Under Mr. Bacot, the bank also scrapped plans to build a $450 million headquarters next door to its Wall Street offices and sold the development site for what will be J.P. Morgan andamp; Co.'s new headquarters.    The bank has also pushed further into securities processing, becoming the No. 2 processor for mutual funds. It has targeted credit cards as a growth area, striking an agreement earlier this year with the AFLCIO to offer Visa and MasterCards to the union's members.    Still, the bank has had some missteps, particularly involving construction loans in Florida. The bank still owns Miami Center, a lavish $197 million hotel-office complex that it acquired several years ago after developer Theodore Gould defaulted on a $62 million mortgage.    If Mr. Bacot has set Bank of New York on an aggressive new tack, Irving Bank remains rudderless in the eyes of many bankers and analysts. Founded in 1851, Irving's organizers prevailed upon popular writer and diplomat Washington Irving to let them use his name for the new bank and his likeness on the bank's currency. In those days, banks printed their own bills, and the bank's organizers felt the writer's name would promote confidence in the institution.    Irving was a fairly dynamic bank until the 1920s, when a management change ushered in a conservative style that has persisted ever since. The one legacy of Irving's more dynamic era is its soaring art nouveau headquarters with the prestigious address of 1 Wall St. at the corner of Broadway. Analysts and bankers had high hopes that Irving would shake itself from its slumber when Joseph A. Rice, formerly an aeronautical engineer with Grumman Corp. who joined Irving's operations department, became chairman in 1984. But analysts say those hopes proved unfounded.    James Rosenberg, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., says, &quot;Irving is weak strategically; they have no game plan.&quot; Felice Gelman, an analyst with Fox-Pitt, Kelton Inc., says: &quot;They're pretty dead in the water. I can't use the word 'very' enough to describe how very cautious they are.&quot;    Foreign exchange and computerized processing are two areas where Irving has excelled. Mr. Rosenberg says: &quot;They're an excellent bank operationally, especially in securities processing. I credit Rice with that.&quot;    One measure of Irving's weakness came during the second quarter when banks boosted their loan-loss reserves for dubious debt to developing countries. While most banks set their reserves at 25% or more of their loans to those countries, Irving boosted its to only about 16%.    Still, many believe that Bank of New York faces a tough fight to gain control of Irving. For one thing, Irving management owns only about 1% of Irving's common stock, so the existing management stands to lose more than it would gain from a Bank of New York takeover. Moreover, Irving executives undoubtedly resent the prospect of being taken over by a bank slightly smaller than itself, even though Bank of New York has a bigger capital base and is more profitable. (Irving, the 21st-largest bank, has $24.2 billion in assets; Bank of New York, the 24th-largest, has $22.2 billion.)    And because Mr. Bacot has been talking for five years with Irving executives about some sort of merger, bankers say, Irving executives have had ample time to devise strategies for fending off unwanted suitors. The details of the strategy aren't known; however, it is likely that Irving will rely on the numerous regulatory approvals needed from both state and federal officials.    It remains to be seen how serious those regulatory hurdles will be. Bank of New York apparently informed regulators of its intent. Moreover, new Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, in his testimony at his confirmation hearing this summer, indicated he isn't concerned about concentration within the banking industry.    Analysts say a Bank of New York-Irving Bank combination is a good fit, particularly on the securities processing side. The combined bank would be the top processor of government securities and unit investment trusts, the second biggest for foreign securities and mutual funds and No. 3 in custody and securities lending. The legal lending limit for the combined bank would also rise to $400 million from $200 million to any one customer, allowing it to woo bigger customers.    Mr. Rosenberg of Shearson Lehman says: &quot;This deal makes a lot of sense. Irving is worth more to Bank of New York than anyone else -- there are more synergies there.&quot; Ms. Gelman of Fox-Pitt calls the terms of Bank of New York's offer &quot;a fair price.&quot;    Bank of New York proposes to recoup its investment quickly by disposing of two-thirds of Irving's branches, selling Irving's Wall Street headquarters, which real estate experts say would fetch about $250 million, and selling at least $500 million of Irving's loans to developing countries. Mr. Bacot says Bank of New York, which presently isn't a primary dealer of government securities, hasn't decided whether it would keep or sell Irving's license as a primary dealer of government securities. In addition, certain low-margin businesses would be pared back, so that the combined bank would shrink in asset size to $41.9 billion from $46.7 billion. Mr. Bacot estimates the consolidation will produce a cumulative pretax saving of $265 million over the next three years.    Bank of New York says it would pay for the cash portion of the acquisition using $225 million in cash, $235 million in short-term debt and $200 million of long-term debt. Bank of New York owns 888,634 shares of Irving, or about 4.9%, which it has acquired over the past four years.    So far, Irving management has been relatively quiet, except to say that it has hired Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz, a leading adviser in takeover battles.    Mr. Rice's tone in a letter to employees suggests that Irving will spurn the offer: &quot;That the Bank of New York would proceed as a hostile raider surprises us, and suggests that the Bank of New York is perhaps interested in protecting themselves from takeover rather than seeking to create a stronger banking institution. . . . Management has long believed that the long-term interests are better served by Irving Bank remaining independent to continue the tradition of growth and quality banking that all the staff has striven to achieve.&quot;    Analysts and bankers are hard-pressed to name a domestic bank that might emerge to top Bank of New York's offer. However, they note that a Japanese bank, lured by Irving's primary dealership in government securities, could become a bidder.    Ms. Gelman says: &quot;The only bidder that I could see coming into this is a foreign bank with cheaper dollars. Then it would be up to the Fed. But with the Fed's recent approval of Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Ltd.'s purchase of Marine Midland Banks, I don't see that as a problem.&quot;    In any case, Mr. Furash, the Washington consultant, believes Bank of New York's bid for Irving will have industrywide repercussions. &quot;This is indicative that banks are concerned about being left behind in the consolidation of the industry. Many bankers are frustrated at the rejection by other banks' management to merger proposals. There are a lot of those bankers all over the country.&quot;    ---               Where the Merger Would Rank   The largest commercial bank holding companies in the U.S.,ranked by total assets on June 30, 1987, in billions ofdollars Citicorp .................................. $194.0 Chase Manhattan ............................. 98.9 Bank America ................................ 96.9 Chemical New York ........................... 78.4 J.P.
