Airlines from countries that were highly visible membersof the anti-Iraq coalition generally showed the worstresults. British Airways said that its passenger traffic lastmonth was 13% lower than in March 1990.</LP><TEXT>   But the U.K. carrier saw some reasons for optimism.Although the airline operated a slimmed-down service duringthe period, with 7.5% less space available, overall loadfactor, or percentage of seats filled, fell only 2.3percentage points to 63.3%. Perhaps more importantly, theMarch figures showed substantial improvement from February,when traffic was 26% below the year-earlier level.   Meanwhile, Scandinavian Airlines System says its trafficis now only 2% below prewar levels. An SAS spokeswoman saysthat while the cause of the drop can't be pinpointed, themost likely reason is the Swedish economic slowdown, nottravel fears associated with the Gulf crisis.   SAS says traffic increased on its intercontinental routesduring the Gulf crisis. &quot;During the war, we saw traffic fallon the Nordic and European routes, but rise on theintercontinental routes. We picked up traffic from U.S.airlines,&quot; the SAS spokeswoman says.   Still, airline analysts say some carriers are being hurtby the lingering fear of terrorism. &quot;Travelers wanted to stayaway from airlines of countries that were activelyprosecuting the war,&quot; says Tim Coombs, an analyst with CountyNatWest in London. &quot;So British Airways and the U.S. airlinessuffered particularly badly. Carriers that were seen as beingmore neutral -- such as Swissair, SAS and, less obviously,KLM -- didn't suffer nearly as much.&quot;   A spokesman for KLM says the Dutch carrier's traffic forMarch was 3.2% below the year-earlier level. &quot;Up untilmid-January traffic was up 7%. So the current levels reflectthe . . . influence of the Gulf war. But traffic is pickingup slowly,&quot; he says.   Lufthansa, meanwhile, saw its passenger totals rise 2.2%last month from a year earlier. A spokesman for the Germancarrier says the increase could reflect traffic on newdomestic routes.</TEXT></DOC>
