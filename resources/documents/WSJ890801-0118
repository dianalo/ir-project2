But days after the accidents, travel and airline reservation agents report that customers are avoiding DC-10s and, in some cases, refusing to fly at all.    Psychologists and psychiatrists aren't surprised. They are learning that airline accidents can spark specific biological responses that build tremendous anxiety in some people.    People tend to experience an accident vicariously, researchers say. For example, they say, some people imagine themselves in the spiraling United plane, hurling toward the ground and cartwheeling across the tarmac in a fireball, all the while strapped to their seats.    In doing so, some people have a biological reaction similar to the one they'd probably experience if they were going through the crash themselves.    According to one theory, imagining a crash stimulates nerve impulses to the hypothalamus section of the brain. &quot;We take the image of the past and put it in the present,&quot; says Reid Wilson, a psychologist who does consulting work for American Airlines.    The hypothalamus sends signals to the adrenal glands, which spew extra levels of epinephrine, a hormone commonly known as adrenaline, into the bloodstream. The epinephrine sparks such reactions as a pounding heart, sweaty palms and high blood pressure.    According to the theory, the epinephrine also overstimulates the sympathetic nervous system, causing the skin to flush. The overstimulation partly leads to heartburn as well.    Such reactions are normal for about two weeks after a crash, says David Charney, a psychiatrist at Roundhouse Square Treatment Center in Alexandria, Va.    Public May Submit Bids To Get Bargain Rates    IF YOU FIND the air-fare pricing situation chaotic now, wait till you see what some people have in mind.    If San Francisco-based Marketel International Inc. has its way, travelers will have an electronic stock exchange of sorts for air fares, hotel rooms and car rentals by March 1990.    The proposed system is aimed at people who don't have to travel at a set time and want to go on the cheap.    Here's how the system might work:    To buy an airline ticket, a customer sends Marketel an order including origination and destination airports and preferred departure times. Customers submit the price they're willing to pay. Then, airlines in the system study the bid and accept or reject it.    The system would be set up to take bids for hotel rooms and car rentals as well.    &quot;We were called crazy when we first came up with the idea,&quot; says William Perell, Marketel's senior vice president and a former rice commodity trader. But the solution &quot;to high prices is to allow deregulation to unfold completely. We never allowed consumers to say how much they wanted to pay.&quot;    What the plan really needs to succeed is for at least one major airline to sign on. But it's unclear how interested the airlines are at this point.    Marketel won't say which travel companies, if any, have signed on as vendors, and many airline pricing executives say they are leery of the proposed system.    Frequent Fliers Snap Up    Putters and Puppies    AMERICAN AIRLINES got double mileage out of an auction this spring for about 400 of its best customers.    The airline created good will by wining and dining the frequent fliers, and it got them to burn millions of their mileage points on promotional items such as pedigreed puppies and a weekend in Hawaii with Michael Jordan, the Chicago Bulls basketball star.    American is one of a growing number of airlines that are turning to spiffy vacation packages and nontravel promotions to get customers to use up mileage points. Awards have included golf putters, portable phones and discounts on Volvo cars.    These new promotions are intended to relieve airlines of a growing liability burden that threatens to cut their revenue. Airlines owe members about four million domestic round-trip tickets, says Randy Petersen, editor of a frequent-flier newsletter. That's enough to fly about 120 billion miles free.    Airline analysts say carriers also are trying to prevent frequent fliers from selling their free tickets to coupon brokers that resell the freebies, a violation of industry policy.    The airlines &quot;are doing anything they can do to get people to use their mileage,&quot; says Rolfe Shellenberger, former marketing director at American. &quot;It's a way of adding spice to the program, while bringing the volume of points down.&quot;    Haute Couture Comes    To the Travel Industry    BE PREPARED to do a double take when you whisk past the National Car Rental System counter. National's uniforms clinched first place in the national transportation category of a contest thrown by New York's Career Apparel Institute.    The new National uniform: forest-green sweaters with pale gray skirts and pants. The judges were especially taken with National's striped ties and belts and its maternity outfits.    The Long Island Railroad's uniforms beat out the Chicago Transit Authority's and New York Transit Authority's to grab the first-place trophy in the regional transportation competition. </TEXT></DOC>
