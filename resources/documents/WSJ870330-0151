The offer was scheduled to expire last Thursday.    Elders, an Australia-based concern, said the offer was extended to allow it more time to obtain required approval for the transaction from Investment Canada, a federal regulatory agency that reviews all large foreign investments in Canada.    An Investment Canada spokesman said he is not aware of any reason that the transaction wouldn't win approval. He said the review should be concluded &quot;about the end of April&quot; unless the agency exercises its right to extend it a further 30 days.    Carling is Canada's third-largest brewery. Elders is a beer, wool and financial services concern. </TEXT></DOC>
