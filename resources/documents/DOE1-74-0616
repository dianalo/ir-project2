<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-74-0616 </DOCNO><TEXT>Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) filed an Auxiliary Service Rider(ASR) to its tariff which reflected PECO's position that the normal servicerate and applicable riders was the appropriate basis for pricing notonly firm supplementary power (power supplied by the utility in additionto that which is supplied by cogeneration), but for firm back-up power(power supplied by the utility to replace generation ordinarily providedby cogeneration equipment during periods of unscheduled outage) as well.The ASR also reflected PECO's position that the normal service rate wasthe appropriate basis for pricing firm maintenance power (power suppliedby the utility to replace the generation from cogeneration facilitieswhen those facilities are scheduled out of service for maintenance),except that firm maintenance power charges under the ASR were proratedin accordance with the number of days that such service was supplied.The administrative law judge and the full Pennsylvania Public ServiceCommission found that the effect of the ASR's firm and interruptibleback-up and maintenance power provisions was to assess excessive chargesand discourage cogeneration development in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, thejudge recommended, and the full commission adopted, a rate design whollydifferent from the one proposed by PECO.</TEXT></DOC>
