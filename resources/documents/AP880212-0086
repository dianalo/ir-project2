More than 20,000 of the famous British fighters were built andsaw service from 1938-1954. The wartime cost of a Spitfire was5,000 pounds _ then about $24,000.   ``There aren't many Spitfires left and when the French asked usto try to get one, we were told the cost would be 300,000 pounds($522,000) or more. We couldn't face up to that,'' said Lt. Gen.Sir Ian Harris.   Haris' British support committee for the Memorial Museum of theBattle of Normandy at Caen is now trying to raise the equivalent of$87,000 to buy a secondhand Typhoon fighter-bomber.   ``It's not a bad substitute,'' Harris said.   Harris, 77, was the first British regimental commander to enterCaen on July 9, 1944. He spoke at a news conference to announce hiscommittee's appeal for a total of $261,000 for the museum.   The money will pay for British war relics ranging from aChurchill tank to a miniature radio transmitter used byintelligence agents landed before the invasion of France on June 6,1944.   ``It's somewhat disconcerting that while it was British troopswho first entered Caen, other countries whose forces were never inthe city are giving the museum substantially more importance andsupport than we are,'' Harris said.   He said that in the United States, for example, 300,000 membersof a Normandy Society plan to support the museum project.   Troops from Germany and 11 allied countries fought in the 78-daybattle around Caen, and nearly 300,000 soldiers were killed.   Caen, 115 miles west of Paris, suffered 10,000 civilian deaths.   Caen Mayor Jean-Marie Girault flew to London for the newsconference at the Imperial War Museum.   He said France is spending nearly $21 million on the museum thatwill be opened on the June 6 anniversary.   The nations involved in the battle have been invited to sendrepresentatives for the opening, the mayor said.   He said those countries were France, East and West Germany,Belgium, Britain, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, theNetherlands, Norway, Poland and the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
