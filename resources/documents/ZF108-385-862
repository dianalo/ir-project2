 You've read in these pages how the &quot;client-server&quot;architecture is an efficient method for sharing information across multipleplatforms.andP;  It does this by dividing processing between a &quot;client&quot;workstation and a database &quot;server.&quot;andM;Typically, a distributed database application consists of a user-friendlyspreadsheet or database &quot;client&quot;--such as Paradox or Excel--extended toprovide transparent access to a networked database &quot;server&quot; application--suchas SQL Server.andP;  The client provides an interface to the database server,while the database server stores and retrieves data and processes queriesfrom different client applications.andM;Most of these environments require file servers to support both &quot;back-end&quot;and traditional LAN resource applications, such as file and printer sharing.andO;The servers must provide high-performance processors (often augmented withmemory caches) and very fast, very reliable fixed-disk systems.andP;  Networkservers must also provide a high-capacity interface.andM;Compaq's new SystemPro comes the closest to being an idealmicrocomputer-based server platform for distributed applications.andM;The SystemPro is one of the first microcomputers to deliver multiprocessingcapability.andP;  The SystemPro provides from eight to 16 MIPS (millions ofinstructions per second) of &quot;scalable&quot; computing power using one or two Intel80386 processors, or 20 to 40 MIPS using one or two 80486 processors.andP;  TheSystemPro is available with up to 256M (4M standard) of 32-bit enhanced pageDRAM memory (a technique that packs more memory in the same space), a maximumstorage capacity of 4.28 gigabytes (that's more than 4,000M), room for 11internal mass storage devices, seven EISA 8-16-32-bit expansion slots, andfour 32-bit processor/memory slots.andP;  The current suggested resale prices forentry-level 80386-based SystemPro models are $15,999 to $25,999.andM;So how fast is it?andP;  Compaq has published Neal Nelson benchmarks, a UNIXindustry standard, which puts the SystemPro's computational power intoperspective.andP;  A SystemPro was tested against a DEC VAX Model 6310 and aHewlett-Packard 9000 Series Model 835 in a typical 60-user officeenvironment.andP;  The SystemPro was six times faster than the DEC VAX, which cost$135,000 more.andP;  It was three times faster than the Hewlett-Packard 9000,which costs $68,000 more.andM;The SystemPro incorporates Flexible Advanced System Architecture withMultiprocessing Support or &quot;Flex/MP.&quot;andP;  Flex/MP is an extension of Compaq'sFLEX architecture, which was introduced in their 80386-based systems.andP;  Theheart of Flex/MP is an Intel 82385 cache memory controller, which coordinatesdata flow between the processor and a proprietary 32-bit processor/memorybus.andP;  Flex/MP enables the processor to execute instructions at high speeds,while relatively slower I/O data transfers occur on the EISA expansion bus.andM;The 32-bit EISA bus can support 8-, 16-, and 32-bit industry standardperipherals.andP;  And 32-bit network interface controllers, such as Novell'sNE3200, are already available to improve network throughput.andM;Perhaps the most innovative feature of the SystemPro is Compaq's drive arraytechnology.andP;  A series of two or four synchronized 32-bit fixed-disk drivesare configured as a &quot;drive array&quot; addressed by the Intelligent Drive Array(IDA) Controller.andP;  By distributing the data across several drives, thephysical drives are unified into a single higher-performance drive.andP;  Thislets the SystemPro deliver 3M- to 6M-array transfer rates, which are up tofour times faster than traditional, nonarrayed fixed-disk drives.andM;Compaq has released &quot;average data service rate&quot; benchmarks, which test fixeddrives in a multiuser, multitasking environment.andP;  A Compaq SystemPro equippedwith an 840M four-drive array was 4.6 times faster than an IBM PS/2 Model80-311 with a 314M drive.andM;Data protection and reliability is critical in database server applications.andO;Compaq's IDA Controller supports &quot;data guarding,&quot; disk mirroring, andcontroller duplexing.andP;  Data guarding is a Compaq innovation that uses 25percent of the data storage capacity to safeguard data.andP;  In the event of adrive failure, &quot;data guard&quot; lets the system continue operating by combiningencoded data with data from the remaining drives to reconstruct data from thefailed drive.andM;Disk mirroring allocates half of each drive space to &quot;mirror&quot; or back upanother drive, so that two copies of a file always exist.andP;  Controllerduplexing, which is operating system dependent, can add an additional levelof fault tolerance by providing support for a redundant IDA controller.andO;Novell has recently announced that they'll support controller duplexing forthe SystemPro in a forthcoming version of Netware 386.andM;What's available to operate on this data demon?andP;  So far, the three biggies ofmultiuser operating systems--Novell, UNIX, and LAN Manager--have alliedthemselves with the SystemPro.andM;Microsoft will soon offer LAN Manager 2.0, which was optimized to work withthe SystemPro (as well as Compaq's Deskpro 486/25).andP;  This OS/2-based networkplatform lets you offload network processing to a second system processor.andO;Banyan Systems also offers a version of its network operating system,VINES/386, for the SystemPro (the &quot;VINES/486 upgrade option for (VINES/386&quot;,which company sources say will soon be shipping), as does Novell (NetWare 386combined with the NE3200, a 32-bit bus master Ethernet network adapter builtto EISA specifications).andP;  Likewise, The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc. offers theUNIX Multiprocessing Extension (SCOMPX) to SCO UNIX System V/386 release 3.2(due out by the time you read this).andP;  The latter takes advantage of theSystemPro's 386 and 486 microprocessors and the EISA bus to provide,according to the company, &quot;two to four times the execution speed and 50percent greater I/O performance than that offered by a standard 386-basedmicrocomputer in multiuser and workstation environments.&quot;andM;Compaq's ability to provide high performance, scalability, connectability,reliability, and compatibility with industry standards make it a trulyexceptional server platform for &quot;minicomputer size&quot;
