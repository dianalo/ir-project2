<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-15-1269 </DOCNO><TEXT>Experimental reports of large enhancements (severalfold) in certain elasticmoduli of compositionally modulated transition-metal--noble-metal superlatticeshave appeared over the last decade. Two general classes of explanationshave been proposed for this effect; one depends upon changes in the electronicstructure resulting from the superlattice periodicity, whereas the otheris based on nonlinear elastic effects driven by the coherency strainof the strained-layer superlattice structures. An atomistic analysisof the elastic properties of a Cu/Ni superlattice has been carried outto differentiate between these ideas. In the case of Cu/Ni superlatticeswith (100) interfaces and two, four, or six monolayers in each layer,we find roughly a 15% enhancement in the biaxial stretching modulus,compared to the reported severalfold enhancement. The observed enhancementis therefore not due to nonlinear elastic effects driven by coherencystrain or interfacial energetics, but probably results from electroniceffects associated with the superlattice periodicity.</TEXT></DOC>
