Rosemarie Kuptana, vice president of the Inuit CircumpolarConference, urged delegates to force environmentalists and animalconservationists ``to answer our arguments,'' the Greenlandnewspaper Information reported Friday.   ``Our opponents are much weeker when it is we who set theagenda,'' Ms. Kuptana, a Canadian, told the 500 Inuit delegates ata conference's meeting in Sisimuit, West Greenland.   It was the first time a Soviet delegation attended a generalassembly of the conference, a non-governmental organization forInuit from Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Soviet Union.   Anger is growing among Arctic natives toward conservationistgroups such as Greenpeace, whose campaigns the Eskimos say havedamaged hunting and the fur trade.   ``It never ceases to amaze me how people can react so stronglyagainst traditional hunting on the part of a little group ofindigenous people _ people who during thousands of years of huntingnever have threatened a single animal species _ while at the sametime industrialized society has polluted the planet to such adegree that there is no way back,'' Ms. Kuptana said.   Greenpeace's Kirsten Sander, who attended the conference as anobserver, admitted that the group's campaign against seal skins inrecent years had done unintended harm to Inuit hunters.   To counter future anti-harvesting campaigns, the conferenceunveiled a far-reaching Inuit conservation strategy.   This policy, largely the initiative of conference members fromCanada and Greenland, embraces all aspects of environmental concernin the Arctic.   Peter Jull, a former Inuit adviser to the Canadian government,said the document calls for detailed research on the environmentand wildlife, including all species that Inuits depend on for foodand clothing.   He said the plan was partly ``an expression that the environmentis our interest and not just for the benefit of companies downsouth somewhere.''   The conference also compiled a guide of policy principles onissues including nuclear power, education and self-government foruse at the regional and local levels.   ``What we're basically saying is that we live in the Arctic andwe know what happens when you mess it up,'' Jull said.   About 40,000 Inuit live in Greenland, 28,000 in Alaska and11,000 in Canada. The Soviet Inuit comprise a small part of the150,000 natives of the Siberian north.</TEXT></DOC>
