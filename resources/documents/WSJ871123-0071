According to the settlement, GE will pay $78.3 million to the utilities. In return, the utilities will turn over two unused non-nuclear turbines -- currently carried on the utilities' books at $41 million -- to GE. The turbines originally were purchased from General Electric in 1979 and 1980.    The suit was brought in 1984 by Cincinnati Gas andamp; Electric Co.; Dayton Power andamp; Light Co., a unit of DPL Inc.; and Columbus Southern Power Co., a unit of American Electric Power Co. The suit sought to recover damages incurred at the Zimmer plant because of design and construction modifications made by General Electric.    A week ago, the utilities settled their suit against the architect of the Zimmer plant, Sargent andamp; Lundy Engineers. Neither settlement, the utilities said, will affect the conversion of Zimmer to a coal-fired plant from a nuclear plant. The conversion is expected to be completed in 1991.    GE called the settlement &quot;good news&quot; for it and its shareholders and said it was possible that it could recoup its entire $78.3 million payment through sales of the equipment it received. In addition to getting the non-nuclear turbines, which when new are valued at between $50 million and $60 million, GE has set up a joint venture with the utilities to sell equipment that isn't needed for the converted Zimmer plant. Sales of that equipment could bring in &quot;tens of millions of dollars,&quot; a GE spokesman said, with proceeds split 50-50 between GE and the three utilities.    The settlement is the logical outcome of a mock trial held last September on charges by the utilities that GE was partly responsible for cost overruns at the plant because of changes in the design and construction of the containment vessels. The jury at the mock trial found GE wasn't liable on any counts, a GE spokesman said, and that the company had met its contractual obligations.    Apparently because GE believes it may recoup the cost of the settlement in equipment sales, it said the settlement won't have any material effect on its fourth-quarter earnings.    Separately, because of losses associated with the suits -- only partially offset by the settlements -- Cincinnati Gas andamp; Electric said it will take a $91 million charge in the fourth quarter. In the year-ago quarter, the company earned $35.1 million, or 66 cents a share, on revenue of $332.8 million. </TEXT></DOC>
