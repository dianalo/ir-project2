Authorities said about 300 students were arrested.   Police in armored vans fired tear gas when about 1,000 chantingstudents tried to force their way past lines of riot police blockingYonsei University's main gate. Riot troopers kicked and punchedprotesters.   Students hurled rocks at the police, and there were reports ofminor injuries on both sides.   The clash came after the government deployed about 20,000 riotpolice to block protests by radical students demanding to take partin the 13th World Youth Festival in the North Korean capital ofPyongyang.   About 300 riot police in combat fatigues raided Sogang Universityin western Seoul earlier today to confiscate posters and literatureon the festival to be held July 1-8. Police said firebombs were alsoseized and two students arrested.   Thousands of riot police were deployed around other campuseswhere students held rallies to demand the right to take part in thefestival.   Riot police stopped and searched many students outside campuses,checking bags for firebombs and anti-government literature. Policeofficials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about 300students had been arrested in the spot checks.   The government has banned plans for thousands of students toassemble at Yonsei University during the weekend. The students haveasked North Korean representatives to come to Yonsei on Saturday fortalks, even though the Korean border is sealed.   The government has said students will not be allowed to go toNorth Korea to take part in the festival. The two Koreas are bitterrivals who have clashed frequently over the years.   North Korea has invited South Korean students to attend the youthfestival, an athletic and cultural festival attended mainly bynon-aligned and communist nations. South Korea has accused the northof attempting to incite domestic unrest to weaken the Seoulgovernment.   South Korean radical students and dissidents have been callingfor the fall of President Roh Tae-woo's government, but they lacksupport because of their extremist views. The radicals have curbedtheir normally violent protests since seven riot troopers werekilled in a clash May 3. Most recent protests have been peaceful.   The government launched a crackdown on the radicals after thetroopers were killed. Many dissidents have been jailed and theirrallies blocked by major shows of police strength.</TEXT></DOC>
