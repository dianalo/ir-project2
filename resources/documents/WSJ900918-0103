Keating Jr., the man the federal government hassaid is responsible for the biggest thrift collapse ever, isscheduled to be arraigned today on criminal fraud charges instate court in Los Angeles.   A California state grand jury last week voted to indictMr. Keating, according to individuals who are familiar withthe government's investigation of Mr. Keating. Theindictment, which was sealed, marks the first time thatcriminal charges have been filed against Mr. Keating, theformer chairman of American Continental Corp.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Keating resigned from his post at American Continentallate last month, after a federal judge dismissed Mr.Keating's challenge to the government takeover of LincolnSavings andamp; Loan Association, American Continental's mainoperating unit. The government seized Lincoln in April 1989,shortly after American Continental filed for protection fromcreditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.   The charges filed against Mr. Keating are said to includeallegations that he defrauded 23,000 investors through thesale of $200 million in unsecured debentures. The debentureswere mostly sold through Lincoln branch offices in LosAngeles and Orange counties. Many purchasers of the bondswere retired investors, some of whom claim that Lincolnbranch officers falsely told them the debentures werefederally guaranteed and were as safe as insured certificatesof deposit.   The indictment also is understood to include charges thatMr. Keating violated California state banking laws. AmericanContinental is based in Phoenix, Ariz. Lincoln is based inthe Orange County, Calif., city of Irvine.   Los Angeles County District Attorney Ira Reiner was namedlast December to head a special statewide &quot;prosecutors' taskforce&quot; looking into the collapse of Lincoln Savings. InFebruary, Mr. Reiner asked for a special grand jury to beempanelled in Los Angeles County to assist in investigatingthe Lincoln case.   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Mr. Reiner, yesterdaydeclined to say whether Mr. Keating had been indicted or wasabout to be arraigned. She did read a statement, however,saying that &quot;the district attorney's office has concluded itspresentation of evidence to the grand jury.&quot; She added thatMr. Reiner wouldn't &quot;comment until such time a court liftsthe seal of confidentiality.&quot;   Stephen C. Neal, a Chicago attorney who is representingMr. Keating, declined to comment on the indictment.   Mr. Keating, who claims he is broke, already faces amultitude of civil suits. The federal Resolution Trust Corp.,responsible for the thrift bailout, has filed a $1.1 billioncivil racketeering suit against Mr. Keating. And the federalOffice of Thrift Supervision has filed administrative chargesagainst Mr. Keating and others, seeking $40.9 million.   The state of California also filed civil charges ofinvestment fraud against Mr. Keating earlier this yearseeking restitution for bondholders. The state has come infor criticism, too, however. Bondholders at one point filed aclaim saying that the state Department of Corporations &quot;knewor should have known. . . . that the subordinated debenturesconstituted an extreme risk to the investing public.&quot;   Mr. Keating's position has been that the bondholderswouldn't have lost anything if the government hadn't seizedLincoln and forced American Continental into bankruptcycourt. The outspoken Mr. Keating also has claimed that thegovernment has conducted what amounts to a vendetta againsthim because of his criticism of the thrift regulatory systemafter American Continental bought Lincoln in 1984.   Meanwhile, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles iscontinuing its investigation of Mr. Keating and others,according to individuals with knowledge of thatinvestigation. These individuals say that federal prosecutorsmay soon bring additional charges against Mr. Keating thatare similar to those being brought by the state ofCalifornia. Defense lawyers say that it is likely that Mr.Keating will be tried first on federal charges.   Federal prosecutors may be waiting for the sentencing ofMichael R. Milken, the former junk bond chief of DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc., scheduled for next week. Mr. Keatingwas once a top Drexel client and a close associate of Mr.Milken's. Mr. Milken has agreed to cooperate with thegovernment after he is sentenced.</TEXT></DOC>
