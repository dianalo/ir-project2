The high court ruled 8-0 that the only recourse for such pension and benefit plans is to complain to the National Labor Relations Board.    The decision is a victory for employers and a defeat for employee benefit plans. If plan officials can only complain to the NLRB, they may be forced by the agency to settle for less than the full amount of the contributions under dispute. And even if a plan wins, the NLRB can't order the employer to pay the plan's attorneys' fees and has no authority to award punitive damages.    Ironically, the NLRB supported the position of benefit plan officials that they should be able to sue for damages in federal court, but the Supreme Court rejected this view.    A multi-employer plan is one in which some or all of the companies in an industry, either nationally or regionally, are parties to a joint collective bargaining agreement and make pension and health and disability benefit payments into a common plan. Such plans are common in the construction trades and some other industries, covering an estimated nine million workers.    Federal law generally prohibits employers from altering employment conditions, such as fringe benefits, while negotiations for a new contract are continuing and an old contract has expired.    Plan officials say employers are often recalcitrant about contributing during such periods, and legal disputes arise.    In one such dispute -- the one on which the high court ruled -- the Laborers Health and Welfare Trust Fund and seven other plans, all in northern California, sued Advanced Lightweight Concrete Co., after the construction industry employer withdrew from a multi-employer plan in 1983, offered to negotiate separately with the unions, and stopped contributing to benefit plans.    A federal district court and appeals court, both in San Francisco, dismissed the suit. The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice John Stevens, agreed that the federal courts have no jurisdiction over such suits. The high court said the intent of Congress to leave such disputes to the NLRB &quot;is so plain&quot; that the plans should appeal to Congress, not to the courts.    Justice Anthony Kennedy didn't participate in the case because it was argued before he joined the court.    Missouri River Water   The high court ruled 8-0 that the Interior Department exceeded its legal authority when it agreed in 1982 to provide water from the Missouri River, stored in the Oahe Reservoir in South Dakota, for a proposed coal slurry pipeline from Wyoming to the Gulf Coast.    In an opinion by Justice Byron White, the high court agreed with arguments by the states of Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska that the water in the reservoir, which was built by the Army Corps of Engineers, was intended for those states and can't be used for industrial purposes without the Army's approval.    A federal district court in Omaha, Neb., and a federal appeals court in St. Louis both ruled that the Interior secretary lacked the authority to provide the water for the pipeline. The Interior Department appeal to the Supreme Court was joined by Energy Transportation Systems Inc., which was planning the pipeline.    Justice Kennedy didn't participate.    State Tideland Leases   The justices, 5-3, upheld the right of Mississippi and other coastal states to control and lease for oil and gas exploration lands under non-navigable waters that are influenced by tides. In an opinion by Justice White, the court said such underwater lands came under state control when Mississippi became a state, just as the 13 original states gained control of similar lands. The court rebuffed claims by Phillips Petroleum Co. that it has title to Mississippi tracts that predates the state's entry into the union in 1817.    Justice Sandra O'Connor dissented, joined by Justices Stevens and Antonin Scalia. Justice Kennedy didn't participate. </TEXT></DOC>
