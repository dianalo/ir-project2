In accordancewith the provisions of the procedural regulations at 10 CFR Part 205, SubpartV, the ERA requests in its Petition that the OHA establish special proceduresto make refunds in order to remedy the effects of alleged regulatory violationswhich were settled by the Exxon consent order. On September 10, 1987, theOHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) which tentatively set forthprocedures for disbursement of the Exxon consent order fund. 52 FR 35313(September 18, 1987). We provided a 30 day period for submission of commentsregarding the proposed procedures. The present Decision will address commentsin connection with the procedures proposed for disbursement of the portionof the Exxon fund allocated to purchasers of Exxon refined products andwill set forth final procedures for distribution of the Exxon refined productpool.Section I below summarizes the tentative procedures set forth in the PDOfor distributing the Exxon refined product pool. Section II reviews andconsiders the comments we received regarding those procedures. SectionIII sets forth the final Exxon refund procedures applicable to partiesclaiming refunds based upon Exxon's alleged overcharges in sales of refinedproducts. The Appendix to this Decision is a suggested application formthat refund applicants may use. Applications for refund from the Exxonrefined product pool must be postmarked by February 28, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Summary of Proposed Exxon Refund Procedures</ITAG>As we stated in the PDO, Exxon is a major integrated refiner which producedand sold crude oil and a full range of refined petroleum products duringthe period of federal price controls. The firm was therefore subject tothe Mandatory Petroleum Price and Allocation Regulations set forth at 6CFR Part 150 and 10 CFR Parts 210, 211, and 212. During the price controlperiod, the ERA conducted an extensive audit of Exxon's operations andalleged in several judicial and administrative proceedings that Exxon hadviolated certain applicable DOE price and allocation regulations in itssales of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Settlement discussionswere held, and on October 8, 1986, the ERA and Exxon finalized a consentorder (Consent Order No. REXL00201Z) that resolved issues pertaining toExxon's crude oil and refined petroleum product operations during the periodJanuary 1, 1973 through January 27, 1981 (the consent order period). Pursuantto the consent order, Exxon remitted a total of $37,798,318 (the consentorder fund) \1\<NOTE/> to the DOE for distribution through Subpart V. These fundsare being held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at theDepartment of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their properdistribution.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ This amount consists of the principal consent order amountof $36,930,356 plus $867,962 in interest which accrued prior to Exxon'spayment to the DOE.In the PDO, we noted that the Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelineswhich may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing a plan ofdistribution of funds received as a result of enforcement proceedings.We further stated that the DOE policy is to use the Subpart V process todistribute such funds. We therefore tentatively granted the ERA's petitionand assumed jurisdiction over disbursement of the Exxon consent order fund.Because the consent order resolves alleged violations involving both salesof crude oil and refined petroleum products, we proposed to divide theconsent order fund into two pools. As we stated in the PDO, 25 percentof the alleged violations settled by the consent order concern Exxon'sproduction and sales of crude oil. We therefore proposed that this samepercentage of the Exxon principal, or $9,449,579.50, plus accrued interest,be set aside as a pool of crude oil funds available for disbursement. Wefurther proposed that 75 percent of the principal contained in the Exxonescrow account, $28,348,738.50, plus interest accrued on that amount, bemade available for distribution to purchasers of Exxon refined petroleumproducts who demonstrate that they were injured as a result of Exxon'salleged regulatory violations. It is this latter sum which is the subjectof this Decision and Order.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The final procedures for disbursing the Exxon crude oilrefund pool were set forth in <T3>Ernest A. Allerkamp, </T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,079 (1988).The PDO set forth the procedures under which purchasers of Exxon refinedproducts could apply for refunds from the $28,348,738.50 pool apportionedto refined products. In this regard, we first presumed that the allegedovercharges were dispersed equally in all sales of refined product madeby Exxon during the consent order period and that refunds should thereforebe made on a pro-rata or volumetric basis. Under the volumetric refundapproach, a claimant's allocable share of the refined product pool is equalto the number of gallons of covered products purchased during the consentorder period times the per gallon refund amount. In the PDO, we tentativelyset the per gallon refund amount at $0.0002419 per gallon. We derived thisfigure by dividing the consent order funds allocated to the Exxon refinedproduct pool ($28,348,738.50) by the approximate number of gallons of coveredproducts other than crude oil which Exxon sold from March 6, 1973, thedate that Exxon became subject to the Federal price controls under SpecialRule No. 1 (38 Fed. Reg. 6283 (March 8, 1973)), through the date of decontrolfor the relevant product (117,185,000,000 gallons).In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, we also proposed to adopta number of presumptions regarding injury for certain categories of Exxonrefined product purchasers. First, we tentatively adopted the presumptionthat an end-user or ultimate consumer of Exxon petroleum products whosebusiness is unrelated to the petroleum industry was injured by the allegedovercharges settled by the consent order. Unlike regulated firms in thepetroleum industry, members of this group generally were not petroleumindustry, members of this group generally were not subject to price controlsduring the consent order period, and were not required to keep recordswhich justified selling price increases by reference to cost increases.Consequently, analysis of the impact of the alleged overcharges on thefinal prices of goods and services produced by members of this group wouldbe beyond the scope of a special refund proceeding. We therefore proposedthat end-users of Exxon refined petroleum products need only document theirpurchase volumes from Exxon during the consent order period to make a sufficientshowing that they were injured by the alleged overcharges and to receivea full volumetric refund.We also proposed that, in order to receive a full volumetric refund, aclaimant whose prices for goods and services are regulated by a governmentalagency, e.g., a public utility, or by the terms of a cooperative agreementneeds only to submit documentation of purchase volumes used by itself or,in the case of a cooperative, sold to its members. However, we stated thata regulated firm or cooperative will also be required to certify that itwill pass any refund received through to its customers or member-customers,provide us with a full explanation of how it plans to accomplish the restitution,and certify that it will notify the appropriate regulatory body or membershipgroup of its receipt of the refund. This latter requirement is based uponthe presumption that, with respect to a regulated firm, any overchargeswould have been routinely passed through to its customers through the operationof automatic adjustment mechanisms. Similarly, any refunds received wouldbe passed through to its customers. With respect to a cooperative, in general,the cooperative agreements which control prices would ensure that the allegedovercharges and, similarly, refunds would be passed through to its member-customers.We also tentatively adopted the presumption that a firm who resold Exxonproducts and requests a small refund was injured by the alleged regulatoryviolations. Under the proposed small claims presumption, a refiner, reseller,or retailer seeking a refund of $5,000 or less, exclusive of interest,would not be required to submit evidence of injury beyond documentationof the volume of Exxon covered products it purchased during the consentorder period. As we have noted in numerous prior proceedings, there maybe considerable expense involved in gathering the types of data necessaryto support a detailed claim of injury; in some cases, that expense mightpossibly exceed the expected refund. Consequently, failure to allow simplifiedapplication procedures for small claims could deprive injured parties oftheir opportunity to obtain a refund. Furthermore, use of the small claimspresumption is desirable in that it allows the OHA to process the largenumber of routine refund claims expected in an efficient manner.We also tentatively adopted a 40 percent presumptive level of injury forall medium-range claimants in this proceeding, whereby, in lieu of makinga detailed showing of injury, a refiner, reseller, or retailer claimantwhose allocable share exceeds $5,000 may elect to receive as its refundthe larger of $5,000 or 40 percent of its allocable share up to $50,000.We stated that the us of this presumption reflects our conviction thatthese claimants were likely to have experienced some injury as a resultof the alleged overcharges. We therefore tentatively determined to adoptthe single general presumptive level of injury of 40 percent for all medium-rangeclaimants, regardless of the refined products they purchased, based uponthe analyses in prior proceedings, most notably in <T3>Gulf Oil Corp., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,381 (1987). Consequently, weproposed that an applicant in this group would only be required to providedocumentation of its purchase volumes of Exxon refined petroleum productsduring the consent order period in order to be eligible for a refund of40 percent of its total allocable share.<ITAG tagnum="81">II. Comments Regarding Distribution of the Exxon Refined Product Pool</ITAG>The only comments we received concerning our proposed procedures for disbursementof the Exxon refined product pool were submitted by the Petroleum Marketers'Association of America (PMAA). In its comments, the PMAA expressed generalsupport for the proposed procedures. However, it questioned the appropriatenessof a general presumptive level of injury of 40 percent for all medium-rangeclaimants, regardless of the products they purchased. Specifically, thePMAA suggests that we adopt higher presumptive levels of injury for medium-rangerefiner, reseller, and retailer purchasers of natural gas liquid products(NGLPs) and middle distillates as we did in <T3>Getty Oil Co., </T3>15 DOE andpara; 85,064 (1986).The PMAA has not provided us with convincing reasons why we should abandonor revise the general presumptive level of injury tentatively adopted inthe PDO. The analysis in the Getty special refund proceeding was largelybased upon data specific to that proceeding. There is no evidence thatthe firm-specific data utilized in the Getty proceeding should have anybearing in the present case. Furthermore from an administrative standpoint,a single cross-the-board presumptive level of injury allows us to streamlinethe process of evaluation of the numerous applications expected. We willtherefore adopt the 40 percent presumptive level of injury for all medium-rangerefiner, reseller, and retailer purchasers of Exxon covered products asproposed in the PDO.The PMAA also urges that we allow all refund applicants to submit in supportof their Applications yearly schedules of their purchase volumes of Exxoncovered products instead of the monthly schedules which we have requiredin most prior proceedings. We are not persuaded that a blanket approvalof the use of yearly purchase volume schedules is appropriate. In evaluatinga refund application, we are willing to accept reasonable estimates ofthe applicant's purchase volumes. In those cases where an applicant submitsestimates, submission of only an annual schedule masks certain factorswhich help us to determine the authenticity of the estimates, such as seasonalpatterns in purchases. In such cases, it is clearly beneficial to be ableto rely upon monthly figures. However, we will accept annual purchase volumedata if submitted in a form that convinces us that the data is reasonablyaccurate, such as a computer printout of purchases provided by Exxon, orif submitted with supporting documentation.Having considered these comments, we will assume jurisdiction over theExxon consent order fund and will issue the final refund procedures applicableto refund claims from the Exxon refined product pool. These proceduresare set forth in Section III below.<ITAG tagnum="81">III. Refund Procedures for the Exxon Refined Product Pool</ITAG>A. <T3>Standards for Evaluation of Refined Product Refund Claims. </T3>ThisSection sets forth the standards applicable to refund claims from the Exxonrefined product pool by purchasers of Exxon products who demonstrate thatthey were injured by Exxon's alleged violations. From our experience withSubpart V proceedings, we expect that potential applicants will fall intothe following categories of Exxon refined product purchasers; (i) End-users,i.e., ultimate consumers; (ii) regulated entities, such as public utilitiesor cooperatives; and (iii) refiners, resellers, and retailers.In order to receive a refund, each claimant will be required to submita schedule of its purchases of Exxon refined petroleum products duringthe consent order period. If the product was not purchased directly fromExxon, the claimant must provide a statement setting forth its reasonsfor maintaining that the product originated with Exxon.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Indirect purchasers who establish that the purchases originatedwith Exxon will be eligible for a refund unless the direct purchaser hasfiled a refund claim and established that it did not pass through the allegedExxon overcharges to its customers. <T3>Compare Southern Union Co./Union Carbide Corp., </T3>16 DOE andpara;85,026 (1987) (full refund to indirect purchaser) with <T3>Resources Extraction andamp; Processing Co./Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>15DOE andpara; 85,145 (1986), <T3>reconsideration denied, </T3>15 DOE andpara; 85,334 (1987) (no refundto indirect purchaser). The level of the refund will depend on (i) whetherthe indirect purchaser falls within one of the classes of applicant whoseinjury is presumed, or demonstrates injury, and (ii) whether the intermediatesupplier demonstrates that it absorbed a portion of the alleged overcharges.In addition, a refiner, reseller, or retailer claimant, except those whochoose to utilize the injury presumptions set forth below, will be requiredto make a detail showing that it was injured by the alleged overcharges.This showing will generally consist of two distinct elements. First, theclaimant will be required to show that it maintained ``banks'' of unrecoupedincreased product costs (banked costs) in excess of the refund claimed.\4\<NOTE/> <T3>See </T3>10 CFR 212.83(e) (refiners) and 212.93(e) (resellers and retailers).Second, because a showing of banks alone is not sufficient to establishinjury, the claimant must provide evidence that market conditions precludedit from increasing its prices to pass through the additional costs associatedwith the alleged overcharges. <T3>See National Helium Corp./Atlantic Richfield Co., </T3>11 DOE andpara;85,257 (1984), <T3>aff'd sub nom. Atlantic Richfield Co. v. DOE, </T3>andpara; 618 F. Supp.1199 (D. Del. 1985). Such a showing could consist of a demonstration thatthe firm suffered a competitive disadvantage as a result of its purchasesfrom Exxon. <T3>Id., See also Allied Materials Corp./Great Plains Corp., </T3>13 DOEandpara; 85,289 (1985).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Claimants who have previously relied upon banked costsin order to receive refunds in other special refund proceedings shouldsubtract those refunds from the cumulative banked costs submitted in thisproceeding. <T3>See Husky Oil Co./Metro Oil Products, Inc. </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,090at 88,179 (1987).1. <T3>Presumptions for Claims Based upon Refined Product Purchases.</T3>As discussed above and in the PDO, refunds will generally be made on apro-rata lor volumetric basis.\5\<NOTE/> In the present case, we expect an exceedingly large numberof refund applications to be filed. As a result of our experience in previousspecial refund proceedings, especially those arising from global settlementswith large refiners, we have decided to simplify the calculation of refundsby increasing the per gallon volumetric refund amount to $0.00025  (1/40thof a cent).\6\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Because we realize that the impact on an individual claimantmay have been greater than the volumetric amount, we will allow any purchaserto file a refund application based upon a claim that an allocation on thebasis of a specifically alleged overcharge amount should be used in consideringits refund application. <T3>See, e.g., Standard Oil Co. (Indiana)/Army and Air Force Exchange Service,</T3>12 DOE andpara; 85,015 (1984).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ This represents a 3% increase from $.0002419. <T3>CF. Conoco Inc., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,316 at 88,791 n. 6 (1985) (volumetricamount rounded to nearest 1/100 of a cent for the sake of simplicity ofcalculation). In addition, as in previous cases, we are establishing aminimum refund amount of $15.00. We have found through our experience thatthe cost of processing claims for amounts less than $15.00 outweighs thebenefits of restitution in those instances. <T3>See Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985).  We will also adopt the presumptions set forth in the PDO regarding injuryfor claimants in each category listed below. These presumptions will generallysimplify the refund proces and will help to ensure that refund claims areevaluated in the most efficient and equitable manner possible.  a. <T3>End-users.</T3> In order to make a sufficient showing that they wereinjured as a result of Exxon's alleged overcharges, end-users of Exxonrefined petroleum products need only document their purchase volumes fromExxon during the consent order period.\7\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ A firm that purchased products from Exxon for use as fuelor raw materials in business operations that were subjected to the DOEregulations will be treated as refiner, reseller, or retailer, as applicable.<T3>See Seminole Refining, Inc., </T3>12 DOE andpara; 85,188 at 88,576 (1985);<T3>National Helium Corp./Farmland Industries, </T3>11 DOE andpara; 85,257at 88,472 (1984).  b. <T3>Regulated Firms and Cooperatives. </T3>A claimant whose prices forgoods and services are regulated by a government agency, e.g., a publicutility, or by the terms of a cooperative agreement, will not be requiredto make a detailed demonstration of injury.\8\<NOTE/> Such a claimant (i) must submit documentation of purchasevolumes used by itself or, in the case of a cooperative, sold to its members;(ii) must certify that it will pass any refund received through to itscustomers or member-customers, provide us with a full explanation of howit plans to accomplish the restitution; and (iii) must certify that itwill notify the appropriate regulatory body or membership group of itsreceipt of the refund.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ A cooperative's sales to non-members will be treated inthe same manner as sales by other resellers. <T3>See Marathon Petroleum Co., </T3>14 DOE andpara; 85,269 at 88,515 (1986). c. <T3>Refiners, Resellers, and Retailers Seeking Refunds of $5,000 or Less.</T3>A refiner, reseller, or retailer seeking a refund of $5,000 or less, exclusiveof interest (i.e., who purchased less than 20,000,000 gallons of Exxonrefined petroleum products during the consent order period), will not berequired to submit evidence of injury beyond documentation of the volumeof Exxon refined petrolum products it purchased during the consent orderperiod.  d. <T3>Medium-Range Refiner, Reseller, and Retailer Claimants. </T3>In lieuof making a detailed showing of injury, a refiner, reseller, or retailerclaimant whose volumetric share exceeds $5,000 may elelct to receive asits refund the larger of $5,000 or 40 percent of its allocable share upto $50,000.\9\<NOTE/> These claimants will only be required to provide documentationof their purchase volumes of Exxon refined petroleum products during theconsent order period.\1\\0\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ That is, claimants who purchased between 20,000,000 gallonsand 500,000,000 gallons of Exxon refined petroleum products during theconsent order period (medium-range claimants) may elect to utilize thispresumption. Claimants who purchased more than 500,000,000 gallons mayelect to limit their claim to $50,000.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ A claimant who makes a detailed demonstration of injurywill be eligible to receive a refund equal to its full allocable share.However, a claimant who attempts to make a detailed showing of injury,but instead provides evidence that leads us to conclude that it passedthrough all of the alleged overcharges will receive no refund. If we concludethat claimant who attempts to prove injury absorbed some of the allegedovercharges, we will grant a partial refund based upon the extent of theinjury shown and not the $5,000 or 40 percent presumptions. <T3>See Union Texas Petroleum Corp./Arrow Enterprises, Inc., </T3>15 DOEandpara; 85,087 (1986); <T3>Quaker State Oil Refining Corp./Campbell Oil Co., </T3>15 DOE andpara;85,089 (1986).e. <T3>Spot Purchasers. </T3>We also are adopting the rebuttable presumptionthat a refiner, reseller, or retailer who made only spot purchases fromExxon did not suffer injury as a result of these purchases.\1\\1\<NOTE/> Accordingly, a spot purchaser claimant must submit specificand detailed evidence to rebut the spot purchaser presumption and to establishthe extent to which it was injured as a result of its spot purchases fromExxon. In prior proceedings we have stated that refunds will be approvedfor spot purchasers who demonstrate that (i) they made the spot purchasesfor the purpose of ensuring a supply for their base period customers customersrather than in anticipation of financial advantage as a result of thosepurchases, and (ii) they were forced by market conditions to resell theproduct at a loss that was not subsequently recouped. <T3>See Quaker State Oil Refining Corp./Certified Gasoline Co., </T3>14DOE andpara; 85,465 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ As we have previously stated, spot purchasers tendto have considerable discretion as to the timing and market in which tomake purchases and therefore would not have made spot market purchasesfrom a firm at increased prices unless they were able to pass through thefull amount of the firm's selling price to their own customers. <T3>See Office of Enforcement, </T3>8 DOE andpara; 82,597 at 85,396-97 (1981).f. <T3>Consignees. </T3>A consignee agent is a firm that distributed coveredproducts pursuant to a contractual agreement with a refiner, under whichthe refiner retained title to the products, specified the price to be paidby the purchaser and paid the consignee a commission based upon the volumeof covered products it distributed. 10 CFR 212.31 (definition of ``consigneeagent''). We are adopting our proposed rebuttable presumption that consigneesof Exxon refined petroleum products were not injured as a result of theirarrangement with their refiner/supplier. <T3>See, e.g., Jay Oil Co., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,147 (1987). However,a consignee may rebut this presumption of non-injury by establishing that``[its] sales volumes, and [its] corresponding commission revenues, declineddue to the alleged uncompetitiveness of [the consent order firm's] practices.''<T3>See Gulf Oil Corp./C.F. Canter Oil Co., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,388 at88,962 (1986).2. <T3>Allocation Claims. </T3>We also recognize that we may receive claimsbased upon Exxon's alleged failure to furnish petroleum products that itwas obliged to supply to the claimant under the DOE allocation regulations.<T3>See </T3>10 CFR Part 211. We will evaluate refund applications basedupon allocation claims by referring to the standards set forth in Decisionssuch as <T3>Standard Oil Co. (Indiana), </T3>10 DOE andpara; 85,048 at 88,220 (1982),and <T3>Aztex Energy Co., </T3>12 DOE andpara; 85,116 (1984). Under those standardsan allocation claimant first must demonstrate the existence of a supplier/purchaserrelationship with the consent order firm and the likelihood that the consentorder firm failed to furnish petroleum products that it was obliged tosupply to the claimant under 10 CFR Part 211. Secondly, the claimant mustprovide evidence that it contemporaneously notified the DOE about, or otherwisesought redress from the alleged allocation violation. Finally, it mustestablish that it was injured and document the extent of the injury.B. <T3>Refund Application Requirements. </T3>We will not accept Applicationsfor Refund from purchasers of refined petroleum products sold by Exxonbetween March 6, 1973 and January 27, 1981. There is no specific applicationform that must be used. However, a suggested format for Exxon Applicationsfor Refund is set forth in the Appendix to this Decision. Retailer applicantsusing the suggested format must file a separate form (with supporting schedules)for <T3>each </T3>retail station for which a refund is requested. All Applicationsfor Refund must contain the following information:(1) A conspicuous reference to ``Exxon Refund Proceeding_Case No. KEF-0087''and the name and address of the applicant during the period for which theclaim is filed, as well as the name to whom the refund check should bemade out and the address to which the check should be sent.(2) The name, title, and telephone number of a person who may be contactedfor additional information concerning the Application.(3) The manner in which the applicant used the Exxon product e.g., whetherthe applicant is a refiner, petroleum jobber, gas station, consumer, consigneeagent, public utility, or cooperative.(4) Monthly schedules of the applicant's purchases of each refined petroleumproduct that it purchased from Exxon from March 6, 1973 through the dateof decontrol of that product (see p. 3 of suggested application form).The applicant must indicate the source of this volume information and,if estimates were used, the estimation method must be explained. Alternatively,the applicant may submit yearly schedules that are (i) convincingly accurateon their face (such as computer printouts provided by Exxon), or (ii) accompaniedby adequate supporting documentation.(5) If the applicant was supplied directly by Exxon, it must provide itsExxon customer number. If the applicant was an indirect purchaser, it mustsubmit the name and address of its immediate supplier and indicate whyit believes that the covered product was originally sold by Exxon.(6) If the applicant is a refiner, reseller, or retailer whose volumetricshare exceeds $5,000, it must indicate whether it elects to receive asits refund the larger of $5,000 or 40 percent of its allocable share upto $50,000. If it does not elect to use the presumptions, it must submita detailed showing that it was injured by the alleged overcharges. <T3>See</T3> Part IIIA, <T3>supra</T3>. (7) A statement whether it or a related firm has filed, or authorized anyindividual to file on its behalf any other refund application in the Exxonproceeding, and if so, an explanation of the circumstances surroundingthat filing or authorization. (8) If the applicant is or was entirely or partly owned by Exxon, it mustexplain the nature of the affiliation. (9) If the applicant has been involved in an enforcement proceeding broughtby DOE or private action under section 210 of the Economic StabilizationAct of 1970, it should describe the action and its current status. If theapplicant was a party to any such action which is no longer pending, itshould indicate how the proceeding was resolved. The applicant must keepthe OHA informed of any change in status during the pendency of its Applicationfor Refund. (10) The Application should also contain the following statement signedby the individual aplicant or a responsible official of the business ororganization applying for a refund: ``I swear (or affirm) that the informationcontained in this application and its attachments is true and correct tothe best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that anyone who is convictedof providing false information to the federal government may be subjectto a fine, a jail sentence, or both, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001. I understandthat the information contained in this application is subject to publicdisclosure. I have enclosed a duplicate of this entire application whichwill be placed in the OHA Public Reference Room.'' All Applications should be sent to: Exxon Corporation Special Refund Proceeding,Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 IndependenceAvenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. All Applications must be filed in duplicateand postmarked by no later than February 28, 1989.
