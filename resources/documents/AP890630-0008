The causes of the strained relations are complex often involvingland, religion, economics or political freedom and are sometimespart of a legacy of countries carved out after World War I.   Tens of thousands of ethnic Turks are fleeing Bulgaria. Balticrepublics demand more freedom from Moscow and Italians resent theGerman-speaking minority in the mountainous north.   In the Soviet Union, some of the most bitterly contested ethnicunrest has hit Central Asia.   While the disputes stem from such different causes thatcomparisons are difficult, the overall picture is dramatic.   A flow of ethnic Turkish refugees has been heading south fromBulgaria into Turkey, and U.N. officials in Geneva say the number islikely to hit 100,000 by July 1.   ``Everyone is packing his bags. A huge wave of immigration is inthe offing and hundreds of thousands may come if the rules do notchange,'' said Mustafa Ahmedov, a 25-year-old teacher who recentlyarrived in Turkey.   The exodus, sparked by Bulgaria's forced assimilation program forthe approximately 1 million ethnic Turks, is bound to strainTurkey's economy and hobble parts of Bulgaria's farm and factoryproduction.   Athens and Ankara, meanwhile, remain at odds over the 120,000Moslems in western Thrace, bordering Turkey. Officials in Ankarainsist on naming the minority ``Turkish'' and periodically expressconcern the rights of the minority are being trampled.   In the mountainous Alto Adige province of northern Italy, theneo-fascist Italian Social Movement has been picking up support fromItalian speakers resentful of the German-speaking majority. The areaalso has been hit by bombings blamed on proponents of separatism.   In Yugoslavia, the most visible of several ethnic splits is thestruggle between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the southern provinceof Kosovo.   More than a half-million Serbs rallied in the provincial capitalof Pristina on Wednesday to mark the 600th anniversary of the Battleof Kosovo, increasing tensions between the two sides. The 1389battle sparked the Serbs' centuries-long fight against Islam.   Serbia's drive to regain more control over its province led torioting by ethnic Albanians in March that killed 25 people in bloodyclashes with security forces.   Romania, under President Nicolae Ceausescu, is trying toeradicate separate ethnic minorities, leading thousands of ethnicHungarians to seek asyslum.   Still, each ethnic conflict has its own roots, often heightenedby different religions and economic imbalances.   ``We can't just lump together the Meskhi Turks in Uzbekistan,northern Ireland and the Germans in northern Italy,'' says WaltraudKokot, an ethnologist at the University of Cologne.   ``We have to understand the conflicts as being restricted both incultural and historical terms,'' she said in an interview.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, during a visit to WestGermany in June, signed a joint declaration with Chancellor HelmutKohl that called for ``a common European home.''   Yet, in his own home, Gorbachev must cope daily with a wide arrayof tensions that could threaten his reforms.   The restive Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuaniahave kept their battles for greater independence violence-free, asthey demand more local control over their relatively well-offeconomies.   After years of tension with their German minority members, Sovietbloc countries have opened a virtual floodgate of emigration. Moscowalone let 33,352 ethnic Germans emigrate to West Germany in thefirst five months of this year, the West German interior ministrysaid.   Seeking ways to stem the flow, the Soviet Union is consideringthe possible establishment of an autonomous ethnic German settlement.   Parts of the Soviet Union have been wracked by ethnic violence.   People have been killed and injured in riots in the Central Asianrepublic of Kazakhstan.   The June 17-20 riots were in the oil production center of NovyUzen between Kazakhs and settlers from the Caucasus Mountainsregion. Native Kazakhs complain the settlers dominate oil industryjobs and receive preferential treatment in housing and otherbenefits.   Earlier in June, a wave of murder and arson swept the FerganaValley region of Uzbekistan, another predominantly Moslem CentralAsian republic.   Rioters there fixed on another ethnic minority: this time theMeskhi Turks, who had been deported to the area from their homelandin Georgia by Josef Stalin in 1944. About 100 people died in theFergana Valley unrest.   Both cases of Central Asian violence came against a background ofpoverty and unemployment in regions whose crops and industries havelong been dictated by Moscow.   On Sunday, Georgians and Azerbaijanis clashed in Soviet Georgiaand five people were wounded, a news editor in the southern republicsaid.   In April, 20 people were killed in the Georgian capital ofTbilisi when troops were called in to quell a pro-democracydemonstration.</TEXT></DOC>
