New casualty estimates putthe number of dead at nearly 470.   The government rejected the rebels' claims. ``The situation isalmost totally under control of the army,'' said Miguel Salavarria,El Salvador's ambassador to the United States.   A rebel communique said guerrillas had liberated parts of eightof the country's 14 provinces. It said people's governments wouldbe established in them.   At least 466 people have been killed in the fighting that hasparalyzed the capital since Saturday night, when the leftistguerrillas mounted their largest offensive of the 10-year-old civilwar.   Despite the government denials, it was clear that rebels heldparts of northern and eastern neighborhoods in San Salvador,controlling some from positions in tall buildings.   The armed forces declared a 24-hour curfew today in sevenneighborhoods, saying it was because of the danger of snipers.   Thousands of residents were trapped after combat intensifiedMonday night between rebels and the government, whose jets andhelicopter gunships rocketed rebel positions in poor neighborhoods.   Looting was reported in supermarkets in some poor neighborhoods.   Rebel leaders in the occupied zones called on the armed forcesto observe a brief cease-fire to allow residents to get food, waterand medical supplies. An armed forces spokesman said he was notauthorized to respond to the proposal.   As combat intensified, hundreds of people fled the denselypopulated Zacamil neighborhood, a working class area. Residentssaid they feared the army would attack. A photographer was unableto enter the zone because of the heavy fighting.   One Zacamil resident said by telephone that the rebels wereadvancing and taking up new positions closer to militaryinstallations.   Civilian casualties were high as government troops and rebelsexchanged gunfire in densely populated districts.   Along a wide arc on San Salvador's northern fringe, rebelsinstalled themselves in homes and apartments and put snipers inchurch towers and tall buildings. People in rebel-held areas saidfood and water were in short supply.   Fighting intensified Monday night in northeastern San Salvadorwhen rebels attacked the San Benito national police batallion nearthe military headquarters.   ``We came down from the mountains and we're going to stayhere,'' a guerrilla who identified himself only as Porfirio saidearlier Monday. ``We're winning so far and we have their moraledown.''   He gestured with his AK-47 assault rifle toward soldiers in thedistance.   ``The combat is hard, the boys (guerrillas) are in all the highbuildings and control the movement of the soldiers,'' said a rescueworker with the Salvadoran Red Cross.   Col. Raul Arturo Lopez, a spokesman for the joint chiefs ofstaff, said today that 309 guerrillas and 106 soldiers had died inthe fighting nationwide. He gave the number of civilian deaths as17, but morgues on Monday said there were at least 51.   Hospitals said 421 civilians had been injured in San Salvador.Lopez said 160 guerrillas, 231 soldiers and 86 civilians had beenwounded.   Medical workers at the main public hospital said the majority ofpeople brought in today had been wounded by rocket fire innorthern, eastern and southern parts of the city.   Few of the city's 1 million people were on the streets Mondayand nearly all downtown stores were closed.   The U.S. Embassy said 1,500 of the rebels' estimated 7,000regulars were fighting in the capital. The government has 45,000soldiers.   The embassy listed the six other provinces where combat wasreported as Santa Ana, San Miguel, La Paz, Usulutan, Chalatenangoand San Vicente. The rebels launched the offensive with attacks on35 to 40 military outposts in the capital and provinces.   In San Miguel, 85 miles to the east, a hospital employee saidMonday by telephone, ``We have heard the fighting since Saturday.The guerrillas have occupied outlying neighborhoods and the peopleare discouraged, without electricity, and only some people dare togo out.''   The rebels said the offensive was intended to pressure therightist government into negotiating in good faith. They suspendedpeace talks last week to protest the Oct. 31 bombing of a leftistunion hall that killed 10 people, blaming the government.   President Alfredo Cristiani on Sunday announced a state ofsiege, suspending free speech, freedom of movement and the right toassemble. He also imposed a dust-to-dawn curfew.   Television stations broadcast their usual programs, but were notallowed to transmit news.   Cristiani, who took office in June, heads the NationalistRepublican Alliance. His party has been linked to death squads thatoperated with virtual impunity early in the war and are blamed formost of the 70,000 deaths in the conflict. Most victims werecivilians.   Col. Rene Ponce, the armed forces chief of staff, said Mondaynight in a television address that government troops hadencountered ``problems'' in neighborhoods around the capital.   He insisted, however, that ``there is no zone under their(rebel) control.''   Military planes fired rockets Monday afternoon into the easternneighborhoods of Venecia and Conacaste, trying to drive outguerrillas. Some rockets struck homes, killing several civiliansand wounding others.   Ponce, however, insisted ``The air force has not bombed anywherein San Salvador.'' He said: ``The men in uniform are working 24hours a day and soon we will gain control.''   The rebels' Radio Venceremos claimed every army attempt toreclaim rebel positions ``has turned into a profound bloodbathamong their troops and elite corps. They have lost whole companies,producing a big demoralization in enemy ranks.''   The insurgents said their presence in urban zones ``has begun toproduce popular uprisings.''</TEXT></DOC>
