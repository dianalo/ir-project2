These data must form part of the documentation to be presentedin proof of the reliability of a reactor's safety system power supply,in accordance with KTA rule 3701.1, 'Principal requirements to be metby the power supply to the safety system of nuclear power plant', (amendment6/78). For determination of disturbance-induced non-availability, failurerates and LOSP times for the units under review have to be known. Thesedata are presented for 380 kV units of a power supply system, drawn fromdocumentation of several years of operation of the 380 kV grids of allutilities under review. For 110 kV units, data can be found in the literature.</TEXT></DOC>
