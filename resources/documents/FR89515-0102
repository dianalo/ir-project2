The proposed amendment requested changes to section 6, Administrative Controls,and requested modification of the audit frequencies for the Security, Emergencyand Fire Protection plans to be consistent with 10 CFR 73.40(d). Noticeof Consideration of Issuance of this amendment was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 24, 1984 (49 FR 7035).  The licensee's application for amendment was dated April 14, 1983, as modifiedDecember 13, 1983, July 25, 1984, January 24, 1986, October 16, 1986 andAugust 18, 1987.  One of the requested changes to section 6, Administrative Controls, involvedthe addition of a footnote to Figure 6.2-1, ``Corporate Organization,''and Figure 6.2-2, ``Facility Organization,'' which would have stated thatthe organizations may be changed ``without prior License Amendment providedthat a revision to Figure 6.2-1 (and Figure 6.2-2) is included with thenext License Amendment request.'' The staff determined that the proposedfootnote was not acceptable, even though the staff does not disagree withits intent. The staff recognizes the addition of the footnote as an attemptby the licensee to address the problem of burdensome administrative effortand delays in implementation of desired organizational changes. However,the proposed footnote would permit unilateral licensee changes to the TechnicalSpecifications (TS) without prior NRC review and approval. This would violatethe regulations. A more appropriate solution is presented in NRC GenericLetter 88-06, which permits removal of the organization charts from theTS with appropriate changes to the administrative control requirementsof the TS.  By letter dated April 27, 1989, the licensee committed to proceed expeditiouslyto request an amendment removing the organization charts from the TS inaccordance with Generic Letter 88-06.  The licensee was notified of the Commission's denial of this request byletter dated May 5, 1989.  By June 14, 1989, the licensee may demand a hearing with respect to thedenial described above and any person whose interest may be affected bythis proceeding may file a written petition for leave to intervene.  A request for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of theCommission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention:Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission'sPublic Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
