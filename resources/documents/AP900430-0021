The U-2 plane, piloted by Francis Gary Powers, was shot down onMay 1, 1960, disrupting a summit meeting 19 days later in Parisbetween President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita S.Khrushchev and forcing the cancellation of another summit plannedfor later that year.   The newspaper Red Star said in the article Sunday that theSoviets mistakenly shot down a MiG-19 and its pilot in theoperation.   The paper also disclosed that the Soviets sent up a new fighterplane and ordered its pilot to ram the U-2 in a suicide mission.The new fighter reached the U-2's altitude but failed to ram it.   Red Star said that Khrushchev was atop Lenin's Mausoleum on RedSquare watching the May Day parade when he learned that a Sovietnew model SA-2 surface-to-air missile had brought down the U-2.   The commander of the Soviet air defense forces, Marshal SergeiBiryuzov, climbed the mausoleum ``carrying happy news, that theplane had been hit by the first rocket,'' the article said. ``AndKhrushchev, standing right there on the tribune, congratulated themarshal.''   Khrushchev, in memoirs smuggled to the West and published in1974, wrote that diplomats watching the parade knew something bighad happened because Biryuzov wore a duty uniform rather than theparade dress worn by the other military officers in Red Square.   Soviets hurrying to the May Day parade in the Ural Mountain cityof Sverdlovsk saw a far different sight, what appeared to befireworks high in the air, said the article, signed by a Col. A.Dokuchayev.   The fiery debris was not fireworks, but a Soviet MiG-19 that washit by the same type of missile that exploded behind Power's U-2and damaged it, Red Star said in the most detailed version of theSoviet military action.   Powers' mission began in Pakistan and was to have carried himover Sverdlovsk for a landing in Norway.   He used neither the automatic destruction device nor poison hehad been given in case the mission failed, and he was captured at acollective farm near Sverdlovsk. He was held for three years, thenexchanged for the Soviet spy Rudolph Abel. Powers published hismemoirs in 1970.   The Soviet article disclosed for the first time that the Sovietshad ordered a new model Sukhoi-9 fighter to pursue the U-2 in anunsuccessful ramming attempt. The Su-9 was unarme but was ablereach nearly to the 70,000 feet at which the U-2 operated, thereport said.   The Soviets also used two MiG-19's, which were not capable offlying that high. The pilot of one MiG-19, Boris Ivazyan, reportedto ground control that the debris from the U-2 was actually thatfrom a missile that had missed the U-2, prompting the groundbattery to fire another.   The next Soviet missile struck the MiG-19 flown by SergeiSafronov, 30, who was killed. He was one of 21 Soviets given medalsfor their role in bringing down Powers, and the Red Star articledisclosed for the first time that he was honored posthumously.   Ivazyan survived and later married Safronov's widow.   U.S. accounts say that the decision to send Powers wascontroversial within the Eisenhower administration. The Soviets hadtried to shoot down a U-2 over the same area on April 9, and somewithin the administration feared sending another mission couldjeopardize U.S.-Soviet relations.   The U-2 incident ended a thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations and wasfollowed by some of the worst moments of the Cold War: the Bay ofPigs landing of U.S.-backed forces in Cuba in January 1961, theconstruction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, and the Cuban missilecrisis in October 1962.</TEXT></DOC>
