(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Divers located the bodies of twomaintenance workers killed Monday when an early morning explosionrumbled through the underpinnings of Ford Motor Co.'s Rouge complex.   The victims were identified as Billy Stiener, 27, of Redford andJohn L. Hatch, in his early 50s, of Detroit, Ford spokesman JohnSpelich said.   The bodies were located at 7:30 p.m. Monday in a half-mile-longportion of a utility tunnel that carries electric, water, steam andcompressed air services to several buildings at the 1,100-acrefacility.   The tunnel, 7 to 8 feet in diameter, was flooded with 4 to 6feet of water after the blast apparently ruptured a water pipe,Spelich said.   The blast tore gaping holes in parking lots, flipped cars, blewwindows from a three-story power substation and forced the companyto shut down a number of operations, including the Mustangautomobile assembly line.   John Schultz, a driver for a bus company Ford contracts to carrypeople around the huge complex, said he saw ``flames shooting 300to 500 feet into the air for a short period of time'' shortly afterthe 6:20 a.m. blast.   There was no fire damage.   Spelich said the two victims were employed by Doetsch IndustrialServices Inc. of Detroit. A woman answering the Doetsch telephone,who refused to give her name, said the company has done maintenancework at the Rouge complex for years.   While the divers searched below, workers on the surface somewearing masks and protective clothing, picked up and bagged debrisout of concern that asbestos, which had been used to wrap the steampipes, might escape into the air. The fibrous mineral has beenshown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Spelich said workersimmediately watered down any areas which might have been affectedby airborne asbestos.   About 6,500 first-shift employees at the complex were sent homeafter the explosion. The afternoon shifts at the Mustang assemblyplant, a metal stamping plant and part of a glass-making operationwere told not to report for work, affecting about 2,500 workers,Ford spokesman Jay Meisenhelder said.   It wasn't clear how long any of the 16,000 workers at thecomplex would be away from their jobs. The assembly plant has beenmaking about 46 Mustangs an hour recently, Spelich said.   The Rouge complex, located in Dearborn a few miles west of theDetroit city limits, includes steel-making and engine plants inaddition to the operations shut down by the blast.</TEXT></DOC>
