An administration official said the project, which would involve the first foreign purchase of the top-of-the-line U.S. tanks, would be part of U.S. efforts to deepen defense cooperation with Egypt. The Reagan administration sees Egypt, the only Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel, as a moderate bulwark in the region against neighboring Libya.    The project will be financed from $1.3 billion in grants that Egypt receives annually from the U.S. under the Foreign Military Sales program.    The administration can undertake the project unless Congress rejects it within five weeks of receiving formal notification. Reagan administration officials already are campaigning to overcome almost certain congressional resistance stemming from concerns about the potential for lost U.S. jobs and the transfer of sensitive technology. Those fears were expressed loudly when news leaked in September that such a project was being considered.    Some congressmen also have voiced fears that the project would enable Egypt to produce its own advanced tanks and to sell them to Arab states that still don't recognize Israel diplomatically.    &quot;I think we've satisfied all of these concerns and will be able to convince congressmen that we haven't taken leave of our senses,&quot; an administration official said.    A General Dynamics Corp. spokesman said the 555-tank project would start with the delivery of some tanks and kits for assembly in Egypt beginning in late 1991 and 1992, and that the portion of the tanks produced by Egypt gradually would grow.    A draft Pentagon paper on the economic impact of the sale, to be given to Congress March 4, says at least 81% of the work over the 10-year period will be done by Americans. Even in the final stages of the project, it says, Egypt will be producing only 35% of each tank.    The report says the Egyptian M-1 program &quot;will generate at least $1.6 billion in direct and indirect income for the American economy and create a minimum of 52,000 man-years of employment in the United States.&quot; A man-year represents one person working for one year.    Egypt won't be sold advanced technology such as armor metallurgy, laser range finders, weapons systems, engine, transmission or fire control systems. It also won't be able to sell any tanks assembled in Egypt to third countries without prior approval of the U.S. government.    The Egyptians were unhappy with many of the restrictions on their participation, but nevertheless opted for the M-1 over alternatives from Britain, France and Brazil. &quot;The bottom line was that they could use our grants to buy in,&quot; said an administration official. &quot;It's not going to cost them a thing.&quot;    Egyptian Defense Minister Abu Ghazala has lobbied Washington for two years for a tank co-production agreement. U.S. military figures warned him the cost would be far greater than simply buying the tanks, and that Egypt's poor quality-control could pose problems. Still, he pushed for the project because of the national prestige that would result from being the first Arab country to produce its own main battle tank.    Initial reports that such a joint production scheme was being studied raised controversy in September. And Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) pushed through an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill that required the administration to report by March on all its plans to export M-1 tank technology and the economic impact of such action.    &quot;I would prefer not to have a fight about Egyptian arms,&quot; said Sen. Metzenbaum, who hasn't yet seen the Pentagon report. He said neither Israel nor pro-Israel lobbyists have raised objections to such a project. &quot;The issue isn't Egypt. It is the export of technology and jobs,&quot; he said.    As part of its policy to phase out Soviet equipment that it bought in the 1960s, Egypt has already bought some 900 M-60 tanks from the U.S. The new plant to build M-1s will be part of a facility also designed to overhaul and repair M-60s. </TEXT></DOC>
