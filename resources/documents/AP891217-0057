(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal agents Sunday searched thesecluded estate of a federal judge killed by a mail bomb deliveredto his home. Investigators said a drug-related motive was onepossibility being examined.   Robert S. Vance, an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge,was killed instantly when the package exploded Saturday afternoonin the kitchen of his suburban Birmingham home, authorities said.His wife, Helen, was injured and remained hospitalized Sunday inserious condition.   Vance, 58, a progressive force in Alabama during 11 years asstate chairman of the Democratic Party, was the third federal judgeto be assassinated in 10 years. The three are believed to be theonly federal jurists killed this century.   FBI spokesman Tom Moore said there were ``specific leads'' butdeclined to elaborate, saying only that investigators were pursuingnumerous possibilities.   Asked whether Vance's death was connected to drug cases handledby his court, ``It is not being ruled out, but it is no moreprominent than several other avenues we are following. We arereviewing his full case load.''   Agent Allen Whitaker said every FBI agent in the Birmingham areawas working on the case. He said many details could not disclosedbecause of the ``very rapid, breaking nature of thisinvestigation.''   U.S. Marshal Thomas C. Greene said Vance had not asked forprotection and the marshal's office was not aware of any threats onhis life. Greene would not say whether security has been increasedfor judges because of the slaying.   Asked about security for other federal judges, Moore said,``They have been warned,'' but declined to say if any were underguard. Judges may request security at any time, he added.   Vance, appointed to the federal appeals court in 1977, served ina circuit that reviewed cases from Florida, Georgia and Alabama.   ``As a member of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, they heardmany appeal cases related to drugs from Miami,'' Sen. HowellHeflin, D-Ala., a longtime friend of Vance, said Saturday.``There's speculation in that regard, but nobody knows.''   The circuit has 12 judges, as well as six judges on senior, orsemi-retired, status. The judges generally serve on three-judgepanels that review rulings made by trial-level courts.   In Miami, U.S. District Judge Lawrence King said if Vance'sdeath were related to drug trafficking, ``you would be more apt tosee this type of violence directed toward a judge or magistrate atthe trial level in Florida, or perhaps Alabama.   ``But who knows?'' King told The Birmingham News.   Vance's two-story home in Birmingham's most exclusive suburb wascordoned off Sunday as federal and local authorities searched it.   Whitaker said FBI agents and postal inspectors spoke with Mrs.Vance at the hospital, and she ``has provided information that willbe helpful in an investigation.''   Whitaker said Mrs. Vance apparently was not standing close toher husband when the bomb exploded. She was able to call aneighbor, who then summoned police to the home, Moore said.   ``Indications are that it was delivered by regular U.S. mail,''not special delivery, Moore said.   Moore said Vance's family was being guarded, but declined togive details. The couple, which had been married 36 years, had twosons, Robert S. Vance Jr., a Birmingham lawyer, and Charles Vance,whose residence wasn't known immediately.   Whitaker and Jefferson County District Attorney David Barberjoined investigators inside the home on a narrow, curving roadlined by houses set deep in wooded estates.   Vance was appointed to the federal appeals court in 1977 byPresident Carter and took his seat the following year. He continuedto live and work in the Birmingham area, although the court isbased in Atlanta.   As state Democratic Party chairman from 1966 to 1977, Vance wasa force for racial moderation, fighting off attacks by then-Gov.George C. Wallace against the national Democratic Party.   In 1974, Wallace sought to wrest control of the state party fromVance, but in a secret ballot in Birmingham, Vance turned backWallace's handpicked choice for chairman.   ``He was a voice of sanity in turbulent times and a leader ofreasoned action,'' said Heflin, who met Vance more than 30 yearsago when they were young trial lawyers. ``Alabama and America'sjurisprudence has suffered a tremendous loss.''   It was believed that only two other federal judges have beenassassinated this century.   U.S. District Judge Richard Daronco, 56, was shot and killed athis home in Pelham, N.Y., in 1988 by a former policeman angry atDaronco's dismissal of a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by hisdaughter. Charles Koster, 67, killed himself after gunning down thejudge.   District Judge John H. Wood Jr., 63, was killed by a sniperoutside his home in San Antonio in 1979. Charles Voyed Harrelsonwas convicted of the contract killing and is serving two lifesentences in a Texas prison. El Paso drug trafficker Jamiel``Jimmy'' Chagra, who authorities say ordered the hit, wasconvicted of conspiring to obstruct the investigation of Wood'smurder and various drug charges. He is serving a life sentence infederal prison.   Chagra had been scheduled to go on trial on drug charges beforeWood the day the judge was slain.</TEXT></DOC>
