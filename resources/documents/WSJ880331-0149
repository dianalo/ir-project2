The economy wasn't given a chance.    International banks were pulling their credit, foreign debt was unpayable, economic sanctions were being applied ever more widely against Pretoria's race-separation policies, and multinational corporations were disinvesting in droves.    But perceptions changed, and so has South Africa's economic outlook.    &quot;Things are looking up,&quot; Gerhard de Kock, South Africa's central bank governor, told foreign journalists. &quot;Prosperity is returning. Confidence in the economy is improving every day. The political pressure on South Africa hasn't declined, but perceptions have improved.&quot;    Among economic data released by the central bank yesterday: South Africa's gross domestic product, stagnant for the past two years, grew at an annual rate of 5% in 1987's fourth quarter, resulting in a 2.5% increase for the entire year; domestic spending rose nearly 5% last year after falling 8% since 1984; fixed private investment increased for the first time since 1981; capital continued to flow out of the country but it slowed to 3.1 billion rand ($1.43 billion) in 1987 from 6.1 billion rand in 1986; and the current-account surplus narrowed as imports jumped 11% to fuel the expanding economy.    Traditionally a capital importer, South Africa became a capital exporter almost overnight as its problems mounted a few years ago. In three years, nearly 20 billion rand fled the country. Business confidence slumped into deep depression. Economic activity came to a halt.    Changing perceptions have made all the difference. In the middle of 1986, the government imposed a state of emergency, rounded up its black opponents and slapped restrictions on the media. Unrest disappeared from television and, slowly, the perception spread that revolution wasn't around the corner and that the government was in control. The economy rose from the dead.    This turnaround in perception hasn't reversed the flow of foreign capital or stopped the sanctions and disinvestment drive. But it has fostered a less-panicky climate. Foreign creditors agreed to reschedule the country's international debt, which amounted to $22.6 billion at the end of 1986. International interest in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is reviving: In the 1987 fourth quarter, foreigners were net purchasers of securities for the first time since early 1985. New export markets have been found. Mr. de Kock says some West European banks have even begun offering trade credits to South African companies again.    All this has done wonders for the local business mood. &quot;If you had told me three years ago that we would lose 20 billion rand, I'd have said it would be disastrous for the country,&quot; says Mr. de Kock. Instead, he's talking about prosperity. &quot;We won't shatter any growth records. We won't do a Korea or Taiwan. But we have made an adjustment and recovery.&quot;    Mr. de Kock says South Africa has adjusted to the fact that sanctions and disinvestment pressures won't go away, and that access to important markets will remain limited. And, he says, the country is learning to live without foreign capital. Businessmen realize that without this international fuel, the economy can't be turned loose. Minibooms will have to do.    &quot;Unlike other countries, we can't make mistakes,&quot; says Mr. de Kock. &quot;We can't enjoy a boom and then always figure we can borrow from the IMF {the International Monetary Fund}. We can't.&quot;    Mr. de Kock figures that with foreign capital the South African economy could grow 5% annually, which would provide enough jobs for the expanding labor force. Without it, the country will have to settle for 3% growth, he says.    But considering all the economy has been through, that is enough to keep businessmen happy, at least for the moment. &quot;When I play golf these days, nobody talks to me about sanctions anymore,&quot; Mr. de Kock says. &quot;They ask, 'Should I buy another house by the ocean?'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
