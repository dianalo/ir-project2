(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The punishment of fallen TV evangelistJimmy Swaggart was left to his church's key governing body today,in an effort to settle a dispute between state and national leadersof the Assemblies of God.   The Pentecostal denomination's 250-member General Presbyteryopens a two-day meeting, with a decision on Swaggart's punishmentexpected Tuesday afternoon, church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said.   The General Presbytery will have the final say on Swaggart'srehabilitation. Swaggart has been linked to a prostitute, but theexact nature of his transgression has not been disclosed since hetearfully stepped down from his pulpit Feb. 21.   The Louisiana Presbytery of the Assemblies of God hadrecommended that Swaggart undergo two years of rehabilitation andbe suspended from his Baton Rouge, La., pulpit for three months.   But the Executive Presbytery, 13 men who serve as a nationalboard of directors for the church, asked the state district toreconsider what some called an unprecedentedly lenient response toa minister's moral lapse.   After gathering again on Feb. 29 in a nine-hour session, theLouisiana Presbytery stood by its original decision. The GeneralPresbytery, whose members include representatives from each of thechurch's state districts, has been charged with resolving theconflict.   Reports circulated that Swaggart would leave the Assemblies ofGod if church officials suspended him from his pulpit for longerthan three months. But a spokesman for Swaggart's ministry said hehas made no decision on how he might react to the nationalcouncil's decision.   Mrs. Turnage said she did not believe the General Presbyterywould be swayed by ``rumors heard through the media.''   Church officials refused to comment on a newspaper report that acompromise proposal has been offered that would bar Swaggart frompreaching for one year, but would order him to give publictestimony about his sin.   The 10-page proposal, obtained Sunday night by The SpringfieldNews-Leader, was worked out by Cliff Jackson, a Little Rock, Ark.,lawyer and church member who said the plan has been endorsed byboth Swaggart and Louisiana church leaders.   Swaggart, who addressed his congregation briefly in Baton Rougeon Sunday as he has done several times since formally relinquishingthe pulpit, is not expected to appear at today's meeting, Mrs.Turnage said.   In response to reporters' shouted questions as he drove from theservice, Swaggart said he wasn't planning to leave the ministry,adding, ``Why should I?''   The General Presbytery is a court of last resort on ministerialcredentials. A minister usually appeals to it after his course ofrehabilitation has been set by the Executive Presbytery and a statecouncil. The Executive Presbytery short-circuited that process whenit decided March 3 to turn the Swaggart case over to the largerbody.   The Louisiana Presbytery has close ties to Swaggart's JimmySwaggart World Ministries, a television-church-school complex basedin Baton Rouge that broadcasts Swaggart's fiery sermons to severalcountries. Louisiana Superintendent Cecil Janway, for example, sitson Swaggart's board.   Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries took in an estimated $150million in 1986. Donations have fallen off since Swaggart'sconfession, forcing the ministry to lay off about 100 people andsuspend construction at the Jimmy Swaggart Bible School.   But Swaggart seems undaunted and apparently is counting on theGeneral Presbytery to follow the Louisiana district'srecommendation that he be barred from the pulpit for only threemonths.   Swaggart told the congregation Wednesday that he was going outof his mind but ``when I'm back in the pulpit on May 22, I'll beback in my mind.''   May 22 would be three months from the day Swaggart confessed andvoluntarily stepped down from his pulpit.</TEXT></DOC>
