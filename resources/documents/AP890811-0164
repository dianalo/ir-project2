(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge heard arguments behind closeddoors Friday in a man's request to prevent his estranged wife fromhaving an abortion, but made no decision.   ``I'm going to have to study a little bit of the law,'' saidHarrison County Circuit Judge Daniel McCarthy, who granted requestsby each side to make the proceedings private, and adjourned thehearing after more than three hours, He gave no indication of whenhe would rule, saying, ``We're going to have to move quickly inthis case and we will. But we need to do more research.''   Burton Anderson, 24, asked McCarthy to prevent his estrangedwife, Melonie, from ending her 4{-month pregnancy on the groundsthat it would cause him irreparable harm and suffering.   On Monday, McCarthy issued a temporary order blocking theabortion. The judge was being asked to issue a permanent injunction.   Anderson's attorney, Mike Aloi, said McCarthy wanted both sidesto submit briefs by Monday. ``Hopefully, he'll have a decision tous by early next week,'' Aloi said, adding that the judge hassealed the file.   Aloi said the judge's temporary order involved a pending divorceand that such cases in West Virginia traditionally are heard in ajudge's chambers.   ``This is a very private and personal matter and we want tolimit the public's involvement as much as possible,'' added MelonieAnderson's attorney, Mary Kay Hansen. She declined comment as sheleft the hearing with her client.   Aloi said the case could break new legal ground in light of theU.S. Supreme Court's recent ruling in a Missouri case which gavestates greater power to regulate abortions.   The high court also refused to hear the case of a Michigan manwho wanted to block his estranged wife from having an abortion,clearing the way for her to terminate her 11-week pregnancy.   ``The Supreme Court made an erroneous decision to make it anabsolute right for a woman to have an abortion. An abortionobviously impacts on the father. It also impacts on the siblings,''said Wanda Franz, president of West Virginians for Life and a vicepresident of the National Right to Life Committee.   The Supreme Court ruling ``opens the door for us to evaluatewhat rights need to be considered besides the rights of themother,'' Franz said. ``I think any ruling that would recognizethat the father also has a concern for his own children and a rightto care for that child would be a victory.''   The Andersons, who have no children, have been married a year.   Mrs. Anderson, 20, has expressed concern about her husband'sability to financially support her and a child and has maintainedthat she should be able to decide whether to continue her pregnancy.   Anderson, a truck driver, says he should have an equal say onwhether the pregnancy should be terminated.   Aloi said Mrs. Anderson aborted an earlier pregnancy withouttelling her husband.   ``He thought it was going to be different this time. He thoughtthey were going to have the baby,'' Aloi said. ``Then he found outfrom a third party that she was going to have an abortion.''   Aloi said the divorce action was filed to get the court to stopMrs. Anderson from ending her pregnancy.   ``This is not a divorce action,'' Aloi said. ``My client'sinformation was that she had an abortion planned for Tuesdaymorning. Time was of the essence. We needed to get into court assoon as possible.''   About a dozen women and children, most of them Anderson'sneighbors, gathered outside the courthouse Friday to support him,carrying signs that read ``Abortion Out, Family In'' and wearingT-shirts which read ``Kids Have A Right To Live.''</TEXT></DOC>
