The London daily quoted unidentified Syrian intelligenceofficers as saying the hostages are imprisoned inside the Hay Madibarracks of Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Beirut's southernsuburbs.   The report could not be independently confirmed.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said``that report is not new. We have never been able to confirm theexact location of the hostages and we cannot confirm this latestreport.   ``Although information on the hostages is conflicting and rarelyreliable we have always believed that some of them are in Beirut'ssouthern suburbs. We continue to pursue all leads about thehostages.''   The Independent said the Syrian officers are convinced thehostages and their kidnappers ``are bottled up in an area no morethan 1,000 yards square and that there is no possibility of thecaptors moving out.''   But the Syrians also acknowledged that the hostages cannot berescued by force and that negotiations are needed with Hezbollah, apro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militant faction, if the hostages ``areto be extricated alive,'' wrote correspondent John Bulloch.   The barracks is situated close to the line dividingHezbollah-controlled territory from the Chiyah suburb dominated bythe pro-Syrian Amal militia, the newspaper said.   Amal and Hezbollah guerrillas had been fighting for control ofLebanon's slums until a cease-fire was called in May.   The report said the single-story building is guarded by about250 men, including Iranian Revolutionary Guards, and contains threesections, including a closed section for ``special guards'' whogive the orders.   The newspaper quoted unidentified intelligence officers inBeirut as saying U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, 43, whowas kidnapped near Tyre on Feb. 17, was moved to the barracksbefore the Syrian army entered south Beirut last month.   The Syrians entered the slums as part of the cease-fireagreement between Amal and Hezbollah.   The Syrians established the hostages' whereabouts fromobservation and tip-offs and from Amal fighters captured duringfighting with the Hezbollah who were later released in prisonerexchanges, the report said.   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing inLebanon. The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped inBeirut on March 16, 1985.   Anderson was also reportedly among the hostages in the barracks.   The three hostages reportedly missing from the barracks wereAlec Collett, 66, a British citizen, and two other hostages ofunknown nationality.   Collett, a New York-based journalist, was kidnapped March 25,1985, while traveling south of Beirut. On April 23, 1986, theRevolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems said it killedCollett in retaliation for British complicity in the April 15 U.S.air attack on Libya. A videotape purporting to show Collett hangedwas made public.   The two unidentified hostages were kidnapped on Jan. 26, 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
