Now, it's ending witha crash.   Entering the 1980s, Loudoun was known primarily for CivilWar battlegrounds, horse farms and the underused Dullesairport. The twin cinema in downtown Leesburg, the sleepycounty seat, was named Tally Ho 1 andamp; 2.</LP><TEXT>   But like many rural areas on the fringe of big cities --Leesburg is only 40 miles northwest of Washington, D.C. --Loudoun boomed during the 1980s. The county's real-estatevalues took off like a missile, and a frenzy of speculationand development lifted its total property value from $1.6billion in 1980 to $12.6 billion in 1990. One confidentdeveloper even called his new shopping strip &quot;ProsperityCenter.&quot;   As the county boomed, its tax revenues soared. The boardof supervisors slashed the property tax rate 25%, and themoney still flooded in. Revenue from real-estate leviesjumped from $38 million to $100 million between 1986 and 1990alone.   The newly rich county established 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. daycare for the two-career couples moving in, built its firstpublic swimming pool for $500,000, offered counseling tocrime victims and started a roommate matching service. Itpoured funds into new group homes for the mentally retarded.It bought an advanced IBM mainframe computer that's the envyof nearby counties with two and three times its population.   The county supervisors even treated themselves to atwo-day retreat at a mountain resort with a $700-a-day&quot;facilitator&quot; who told them how to speed up decision-makingand improve relations with county employees. Among hissuggestions: think of themselves as &quot;Team Loudoun&quot; and usesoccer as a model of cooperation.   Those palmy days are over. This year, for the first timein decades, the value of Loudoun property will decline, by$300 million or more. The value of vacant land, whichattracted the hottest speculation, is down about 10%. Andjust as tax revenues multiplied when real estate boomed, nowthey are shrinking as the county reassesses property values.   The result: &quot;It's going to be just beating our brains outfor the next four years,&quot; says Steve Stockman, a member ofthe board of supervisors. The county's fiscal problems are sosevere that they make Mr. Stockman's woes seem as vexing asthose once confronting his brother David, President Reagan'sbudget director.   A similar squeeze is afflicting scores of other countiesacross the country, from Gwinnett County, Ga., to Santa ClaraCounty, Calif. These exurban areas, which raise the largestportion of their revenues from real-estate taxes, were flushwith cash in the 1980s as their once-rural land filled upwith office buildings, strip malls and housing developments.They became hooked on steadily rising revenue; and now, withreal estate weak, they are suffering sharp pangs ofwithdrawal.   &quot;It's a big problem,&quot; says Bonnie Dyga, budget director ofHillsborough County, Fla. In the mid-1980s, the county, whichsurrounds Tampa, enjoyed 20%-a-year increases in itsreal-estate tax base. This year, some projects are plungingin value, and the county is hoping for, at best, a 5% rise inthe tax base. Hillsborough cut 300 of its 7,800 jobs lastyear, and more cutbacks are coming, Ms. Dyga says.   Even if the end of the Persian Gulf war bolsters somesectors of the U.S. economy, no one expects commercial realestate to rebound quickly after the excess of the 1980s. Thenext year or two will be &quot;tough times for most countygovernments,&quot; says John Thomas, executive director of theNational Association of Counties.   Loudoun's problems are immense. The average family in thecounty receives about $5,800 in services each year, accordingto Albert Van Huyck, a retired international-developmentexpert now running for chairman of the board of supervisors.But the average household's tax payment is only $1,280 --less than a quarter of the cost of services. In the 1980s,tax payments from developers covered the gap. But withdevelopment ground to a halt, the shortfall has become ayawning menace.   To maintain services instituted in the 1980s and to carryout its ambitious plans, Loudoun would have to raise taxesnearly 40%. But supervisors, who fear getting scalded in thisfall's elections by an already-simmering taxpayer revolt,aren't willing to do that. And so Loudoun -- which, like mostlocal governments but unlike the federal government, mustbalance its books -- is pushing an intense belt-tighteningcampaign.   &quot;Now, the bills have come due,&quot; County AdministratorPhilip Bolen remarks.   Some blame the county's problems partly on profligacy.While officials argue that purchasing the big computer waswise planning for the future, others say it far exceeds thecounty's needs. &quot;We could hire monks with quill pens andparchment and come out ahead on that one,&quot; Mr. Van Huycksays.   Two big projects put on the drawing boards late in the1980s epitomized for many the idea that the government wasfollowing &quot;the yellow brick road,&quot; as Stephen Wagner,president of Community Bank andamp; Trust in Sterling, puts it.   One was a $45 million, 300,000-square-foot administrativebuilding that struck many citizens as extravagant -- costingmore than $500 for every man, woman and child in the county.Officials maintain nonetheless that, in the long run, thebuilding would actually save money on rent.   The other was the plan for a $35 million high school andregional athletic center. Though the originally planned3,000-seat football stadium was a sandlot by Texashigh-school standards, some county residents wondered whetherschool officials weren't driven by a desire to oversee grandregional events. Frank Raflo, a supervisor for 14 years whois now a newspaper columnist, says he found out that otherhigh schools built recently in Virginia cost $12,000 perstudent; Loudoun's would have cost $22,000. Jacking up thebill were such amenities as classrooms big enough to providespace for personal computers.   &quot;It was the height of rosy scenario,&quot; Mr. Raflo says.   But such excesses alone can't explain the surge in thecounty's budget from $49.2 million in 1980 to the $271million plan adopted for the fiscal year ending in June. Thatgrowth far outstripped increases in on, which rose during the1980s from 57,000 to 86,000, and inflation.   Some of the spending was mandated under federal and statelaw, and most of it went to the myriad costs of turning arural county into a hotbed of growth: waste disposal, forinstance, and big staff increases to handle necessities suchas planning, zoning and building inspections. Some officialsinsist that the county had to catch up on items once ignored,such as building libraries and developing parks for futureresidents who don't have horse farms.   More important, some contend, is the way demographicchanges increased the number of families needing variousforms of assistance. The growth in two-career families hasincreased demand for day care, after-school programs andmental health care, they say. And they cite more subtleeffects as well.   &quot;The family situation puts more cars on the road&quot; and thusincreases the wear and tear and the county's repair costs,says Charles Bos, vice chairman of the Board of Supervisors.&quot;Working parents and divorced parents create new socialproblems for the schools.&quot; And he worries that the countycan't afford new programs such as one, started last year,that provides day care for Alzheimer's patients.   Even Mr. Van Huyck, who criticizes the government's lackof planning for leaner days, says, &quot;The county wasn't intothis huge social-service delivery to relatively well-offpeople. These are programs designed to relieve stress onfamilies who are desperately trying to make ends meet.&quot;   So, the county is facing difficult choices in decidingwhere to cut. Dropping the frills -- which the county isdoing -- won't solve the $30 million-plus deficit looming infiscal 1992 if Loudoun tried to keep up its current spendingpace. Already, the $45 million administrative building hasbeen postponed for five years, and the highschool price tagpared to $30.7 million. (The size of the stadium hasn't beendecided.) County staffing is frozen; layoffs are looming.There isn't enough money for the teacher raises that havekept the county's salaries competitive.   Just last month, Mr. Bolen, the county administrator, gavethe supervisors a sobering list of 243 service cutbacksrequired if the current tax rate is to be maintained.   Though some cuts won't be hard to swallow -- the sheriff'sdepartment says it can save $20,000 in rental-car costsbecause it is using more cars confiscated from drug dealers-- others will hurt. Substance-abuse counseling at the youthshelter would be halved even though drug problems aregrowing. Twenty mentally retarded people waiting forcounty-subsidized housing wouldn't get it; that saves$300,000. Libraries would have to cut back their purchases ofbooks, magazines and newspapers by 35% -- for a saving of$165,000. Eliminating day-care subsidies to 40 families with96 children would save another $165,000.   &quot;Many of those families are headed by single women whowill have a tough time hanging onto their jobs,&quot; says CarmenNazario, Loudoun's director of social services. Herdepartment is especially squeezed because the number ofpeople asking for food stamps, income subsidies and otherhelp is double that a year ago.   In elementary schools, all art, music andphysical-education teachers would be laid off, with homeroomteachers picking up the slack. The pupil-teacher ratio wouldrise from 21-to-1 to 24-to-1. Also possibly targeted is$500,000 that Loudoun pays to a nearby county to enroll about50 students in a science high school. &quot;These are things thatmake this a nice place to live,&quot; says C. Carroll Laycock, theschool board chairman. &quot;I hate to see that damaged.&quot;   In smaller ways, too, the cuts would affect wide areas ofcounty life. The volunteer firefighters each would pay $50for their instruction manuals. Community centers would close,tossing boy and girl scouts out of their meeting places, andthe parks and recreation department couldn't replace its22-year-old tractor.   Making the cuts won't be easy. At a budget hearing heldrecently in a junior-high-school auditorium, 500 peoplegathered for a meeting that dragged on for five hours. Nearly60 people spoke against reductions in education andmental-health programs. Though a few opposed tax increases,some practically begged for one. One man even offered towrite a check on the spot for the extra taxes he's willing topay. &quot;I'll try to get my neighbors to do the same,&quot; he said.   But the supervisors don't believe that is the sentiment ofmost county residents, including many farmers and retirees.They are dead set against a tax increase of more than 10% orso. In mid-March, county voters defeated, 2 to 1, a proposalto raise $5 million to buy and preserve ecologicallysensitive land; many people viewed that as indicatingwidespread anger about the government's spending.   &quot;We have to decide whether a spot in a group home is wortha job in the government or raising the teacher-pupil ratio,&quot;Mr. Bos says.   Even before the spending cuts go into effect, the hugeswings in the county government's fortunes have stirreddistrust among many once-neighborly residents. That'sespecially true, says Mr. Bolen, when the recession isstirring up anxiety and cynicism, and &quot;local government isthe focus of that.&quot; Record numbers of angry homeowners arechallenging their sharply higher real-estate assessments, forinstance.   &quot;The public's money is a lot like drugs,&quot; says JamesBurton, a retired Air Force colonel. &quot;It's very easy tobecome addicted to it.&quot; His solution: &quot;Send the supervisorsto a detox center.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
