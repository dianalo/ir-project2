The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, saidJamie officials agreed they should disband it because of Mulheren'sincapacitation.   Fred Stone, Jamie's general counsel, confirmed that ``Jamie isin the process of dissolution'' but would not elaborate on why.   Officials at the New York Stock Exchange and American StockExchange said Tuesday that Jamie resigned its membership from bothexchanges April 7.   Once one of Wall Street's most aggressive speculators in stocksof companies targeted for rumored and actual takeovers, Jamie hadmore than $300 million under management.   Jamie's activities have declined sharply since Mulheren,carrying a loaded rifle, was seized by police Feb. 18 outside hisRumson, N.J. home and charged with threatening to kill Boesky andBoesky's former trader Michael Davidoff.   Both men were said to have implicated Mulheren in a Wall Streetcorruption scandal that centers around Boesky, formerly aflamboyant speculator who traded stocks based on illegal insideinformation. Boesky is now in a federal prison.   Mulheren, who suffers from manic depression, has been in a NewJersey private psychiatric hospital since March 10, when a federalcourt denied a government motion to keep him jailed because ofclaims that he is dangerous.   He is said to be under investigation by both the Securities andExchange Commission and a federal grand jury.   The government has submitted an affidavit to a federalmagistrate in Manhattan that says prosecutors and Mulheren'sattorneys are talking about disposing of the case, which has led tospeculation that plea bargaining is taking place.   Otto Obermaier, Mulheren's chief attorney, said in response that``the prosecution and defense in all cases talk about a variety oftopics, including possible resolution of their differences and alsopossible preparation for trial.''</TEXT></DOC>
