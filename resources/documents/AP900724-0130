The winners of the viewer poll: stories on the controversialanti-depression drug Prozac and an Alabama marijuana eradicationprogram.   ``This was the shakedown cruise,'' executive producer JoshuaLoory said after the show, which was the network's first attempt atinteractive television. ``I think there were some minor productionproblems, but all in all, it went pretty well. I'm tickled rightnow.''   Near the beginning of the hour-long show, which starts atmidnight, viewers were presented with a menu of six stories and the900 number, which costs 75 cents to call. The calls were tabulatedby computer and the two most popular stories were fit into theregular newscast, one in the top half-hour, the other in the secondhalf-hour.   Besides the two winners, viewers had a choice of stories on thelatest testimony in Washington Mayor Marion Barry's drug trial, asailing program designed to keep native American teens off drugs,summer jobs and efforts to save the spotted owl.   The story on Prozac received 35 percent of the vote, while thedrug eradication program received 26 percent. The stories on thesailing program, summer jobs and the spotted owl got few votes, hesaid.   Loory said the show's producers are content to leave viewerselection at two stories.   ``We're still very much in control of what's going into theshow,'' he said.   Although the network has no current plans to use the poll as along-term guide, ``it'll probably be pretty interesting to look atthe choices down the road and see what the viewers are selecting,''Loory said.</TEXT></DOC>
