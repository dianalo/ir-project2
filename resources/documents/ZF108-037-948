 This, however, will only be realized if you have thehardware to bring out the best in your machine.andP;  This is where the PC'salmost unique expandability makes it so versatile: the more you're preparedto put into your playing, the more you're going to get out of it.andM;By the way, before we go any further I'd just like to point out that thisupgrading business is not only expensive, it's also highly addictive and onceyou've started you may never want to stop -- so think carefully beforereading on.andM;Still with us?andP;  Right, let's divide the mechanics of PC gaming into threeseparate sections and tackle them accordingly.andP;  The three elements in orderof importance are: manipulation, graphics and sound.andM;I could also mention machine speed here, but it seems that people somehow getused to the speed of their own machine.andP;  As long as you're not driving an Xtalongside some whizz-kid with a 486-equipped racing machine, you'll neverknow that you're missing.andP;  Besides, faster doesn't necessarily mean better,as some games actually move too quickly on the quicker machines and end upvirtually unplayableandM;So, back to the list of three--and indeed, the first element on that list.andM;ManipulationandM;There are three basic game control methods: keyboard, mouse and joystick.andO;There are also a number of others, including trackballs, paddles and flightsticks (basically advanced joysticks which more accurately simulate aircraftcontrols for those who really enjoy their simulated trips to the clousd), but these are so obscure that I'm almost sorry I mentioned them.andM;Everyone who owns a PC has a keyboard, so I've got no problem selling youthat paticular avenue of exploration.andP;  The trouble is that many games aresimply too difficult to be handled by this clumsy interface (PalaceSoftware's wonderful mediaeval swordplay game Barbarian uses a range of keysso vast that a doublejointed octopus would be hard pressed to find time toscratch her nose -- if the had one).andM;Basically, the keyboard is okay for most text adventures (a style of gamethat's apparently been popular since Arthur first pulled Excalibur from thestone) and shoot'em ups, but if you want to deve any deeper you'll have tobite the bullet and get yourself a mouse.andM;The great thing about buying a mouse is that you can always pretend that youneed it for business (you see, there's the first sign of addiction -- ropeyrationalizations).andP;  Also, games with mouse control somehow feel more'sophisticated' -- Sierra's range of graphic adventures is a good examples ofrodent-driven epics and if published sales figures are true then it wouldseem that just about everyone onethe US has at least one of them already.andM;The final advantage of using a mouse is that you'll probably already have aplace to plug it in -- which may not be the case if you finally dive inhead-first and go for a joystick.andM;Now, suddenly we're on dodgy ground.andP;  There's something a little bit sinisterabout these phallic boxes with their shiny red buttons--visions spring tomind of spotty youths drooling from the corners of their mouths as they takeout yet another wave of reptillions from the planet Zog.andM;Unfortunately, using one of these sticks is not only the best way to enoymost games--it's the only way to enjoy some.andM;Dogier still is the fact that to use a joystick you'll almost certainly haveto take the back off and install a games card, and although most joysticksare cheaper than mice, there's no way that you'll be able to justify the costas for anything other than pure entertainment.andM;One final note of caution on the manipulation front: you may find that onceyou've got your mouse and joystick neatly on the desk in front of you, thegame won't let you use either of them.andP;  So always remember the first rule ofPC games buying -- read the specification sticker!andM;GraphicsandM;If the last section seemed unnecessarily confused, wait until you see whatyou have to go through here.andP;  Basically, computer games can look likeanything from monochrome word processor screens (text adventures again) to'interactive' animated films.andP;  But unless you've got the necessary chipsinstalled, the graphic artist's endeavours could be entirely wasted.andM;At the risk of covering old ground, here's a quick summary of PC graphicsstandards.andM;First there's good old fashioned mono.andP;  Unfortunately, this will only displaytext, so it's of almost no relevance to the subject we're trying to coverhere.andP;  Next up is Hercules, and although this too is monochrome, it doesproduce some crisp single-colour graphics -- the big drawback is that verylittle software supports it.andM;So it looks as though you're going to have to plump fr one of the Gee Ayfamily -- Cee, Eee or Vee.andP;  CGA is a step up from Hercules, supporting fourcolours, but these usually include cyan and an unspeakable mauve and make anygame look at least five years out of date.andP;  Avoid.andM;Any semi-serious games player will have to invest in either EGA or VGAgraphics.andP;  VGA's 64-colour display may seem more appealing than EGA's morehumble 16, but you'll find that 16 colours is usually enough to add spice toyour shooting so maybe EGA is the more reasonable option (although there'ssomething strangely beautiful about good use of VGA graphics -- check outMicroprose's F-15 Strike Eagle II, for example).andM;Of course, you'll probably have to upgrade your monitor if you install one ofthe latter two cards making the upgrade decision even more painful cost-wise.andM;Once again, observe the first rule strictly (remember the one about actuallyreading the packaging?), as there's almost no telling which standard anyparticular game will support.andP;  Some will only support the two high-endformats, while others will only utilize CGA and Hercules--don't expect logic.andM;SoundandM;And now for some sound advice.andP;  Anyone who expects the standard PC squeakerto add to a game's atmosphere or entertainment value has spent for too longlistening to Radio 4 through an old crystal set.andP;  A suitable soundtrack andrealistic spot effects go a long way towards creating a 'virtual world'within a game--in other words if it sounds real you're more likely to believein what you're doing.andM;Unfortunately, there's no cheap way to squeeze suitable notes out of yourexisting hardware.andP;  The only course therefore is to invest (and I use theword in its loosest possible sense) in one of the many sound boards whichhave become available over the past year.andM;Names to watch out for include the Adlib, the Game Blaster and Roland'sincredible LAPC-1, which is essentially a synthesizer on a card.andP;  The qualityof sounds and range of uses for these varies greatly, but each is asignificant improvement over standard PC sound.andP;  (More information on GamesBlaster from Data Liberation on (0983) 864674; Roland will talk sound senseon (01) 568 1247.)andM;Unfortunately, software compatibility is an even greater problem here than inthe graphics department, with most programs supporting none of the availablehardware, some supporting it all and others going for a single (seeminglyrandom) choice.andP;  This situation should improve over the next year or so, asevent he UK software publishers (who are still relatively new to developingPC games) are beginning to accept these new sonic additions as standard.andM;Like the joystick, it's difficult to see how you could justify the heavyexpenditure for one of these upgrades (audio business presentations,anyone?), but once you've heard some real sound coming from your desktopworkhorse it's difficult to go back to the blips and squeaks of old.andM;So there you have it--in order to play games of any worth you may have toadapt your present hardware beyond recognition.andP;  On the other hand, therehsnothing wrong with a quick blast of RoboCop on a standard Amstrad 1512either.andP;  You ays your money and you makes your choice.andM;For what it's worth though, I work in an office that's particularly wellendowed with the modern generation of 16-bit wonder computers, yet ourrecently-upgraded PC (which sports VGA, a joystick, a mouse and a Rolandsynth card played through a 50-watt stereo) is never out of action, while theCommodore Amiga and Atari ST remain stragely silent -- food for thought isn'tit?andM;FIRM DECISIONSandM;Could you ever see yourself going into a book store and choosing a newpot-boiler because it was published by Penguin?andP;  Or how about going to thecinema, turning to your beloved and saying: &quot;Oh look dear, they're showingthe latest from Paramount!&quot;andP;  Stranger still, who'd go into their local recordemporium to pick up the new CD from CBS?andM;Things like that happen every day in the computer entertainment business.andO;For some reason, software consuers have grown to know and love certaincompanies and labels, and now trust them to deliver the goods with each newrelease.andP;  But then, this isn't quite as dumb as it seems, as labels do tendto have their own particular 'type' which they stick to, for better or worse.andM;So, for the record, here's a list of ten of the top PC publishers in the UKleisure software business -- in no particular order (other thanalphabetical).andM;ACCOLADEandM;* (01) 585 3308andM;Based in San Jose, but recently set up in Clapham, Accolade is best known forits driving 'simulators', although it's just begun to expand its range withsome sports titles (Hard Ball II and Jack Nicklaus Golf), a tank simulator(Steel Thunder), a flight simulator (The Blue Angels) and a couple ofadventure games (Don't Go Alone and The Third Courier).andP;  It's the driversthat count though: Test Drive, Test Drive II, Grand Prix Circuit, The Cycles-- the list is almost endless.andM;ACTIVISIONandM;* (0374) 310003andM;Activision (Europe) is a Reading-based division of one of the US's largestsoftware publishers, and for this reason it has one of the strongest pccatalogues currently available.andP;  Add to this its European distribution dealfor the Sierra range (Leisure Suit Larry et al) and the company emerges aaspossibly the strongest contender in this market.andP;  The list is almost endless(and the range and diversity of its catalogue makes choosing a particulartype of game almost irrelevant anyway), but watch out in particular for the'Quest' series from the Sierra list.andM;DOMARKandM;* (01) 780 2222andM;A very 'British' company (owned and run by two ex-advertising types who liketo portrary themselves as fairly silly Sloanes), Domark has recently signed adeal with a US major, Broderbund, and has simultaneously begun to develop itsown catalogue for the IBM-compatibles.andP;  Previously knoon for its 'dinnerparty' type products (Trivial Pursuit, Pictionary etc), it's now begun todevelop a lot of younger 'arcadey' material due to a licensing deal with themassive Atari corporation.andM;ELECTRONIC ARTSandM;* (0753) 49442andM;It likes to describe itself as &quot;an association of electronic artists whoshare a common goal&quot;, but this is as hard-nosed a US corporation as any ofthem.andP;  A strong streak of originality runs through its catalogue -- afterall, this is the company behind the extrarordinary 'God simulator'sPopulous--and it does seem to pay more than lip service to new developmentssuch as synthesized sound and high-end graphics.andP;  All this and Deluxe PaintII.andM;MICROPROSEandM;* (0666) 504326andM;For many years this US giant was almost solely dedicated to producingmilitary-style simulators, and while it continues to dominate this field ithas recently purchased two of the most creative and respected UK labels,Rainbird and Firebird, and is now beginning to push back the boundaries oforiginal software development.andP;  Flight and fight simulators to watch out forinclude F-15 Strike Eagle II, M1 Tank Platoon and F-19 Stealth Fighter.andM;MINDSCAPEandM;* (044486) 545andM;Another off-shoot of a major US firm Mindscape's UK arm is probably thesmallest of the Yankee invaders'.andP;  However this doen't stop it producing awide range of diverse and idiosyncratic games -- Fiendish Freddie's Big TopO' Fun (a comical circus compendium), Life and Death (a surgery simulator!),andO;Star Trek V (the processor cannae take it Cap'n) and a host of utilitysoftware.andM;MIRRORSOFTandM;* (0) 928 1454andM;Part of Robert Maxwell's growing empire, its in-house label, Image Works, isactually its least prolific PC producer.andP;  Most of its IBM-compatible outputcomes from US affiliates Spectrum holobyte (whose simulators include theexcellent Falcon), FTL (watch out for the imminent Dungeon Master, completewith a top secret sound attachment) and last, but by no means least,Cinemaware, the King of the 'interactive movie'.andM;OCEANandM;* (061) 832 6633andM;Although it's by far and away the biggest UK leisure software publisher, thisManchester-based company is something of a newcomer to developing productsfor the PC.andP;  This is about to change, however, with the release early nextyear of a futuristic flight simulator, F-29 Retaliator.andP;  Its back catalogueis aimed primarily at a younger audience and includes arcade conversions suchas RoboCop (the game fo the film) and Arkanoid (a bat and ball game).andM;US GOLDandM;* (021) 625 3388andM;Once again, a major UK developer which imports most of its PC product from USaffiliates.andP;  Most notable are Lucasfilm (George 'Star Wars' Lucas's spin-offprogramming team, responsible for the latest Indiana Jones game) and Epyx(best known for its multi-format 'Games' series, including World Games andCalifornia Games).andM;VIRGIN/MASTERTRONICandM;* (01) 727 8070andM;Yep!andP;  Old Dickie Branson has his finger in this pie too, although his companyhas failed to make any impact in the full-price PC market.andP;  However, a newspin-off, 16-Blitz, is about to flood your stores with heaps of software forunder a fiver!andP;  Although some of this is poor quality and probably wouldn'thave been released at any other price, the majority is back catalogue whichoriginally saw the shelves at a whopping 25 pound sterling and is probablywell worth checking out.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
