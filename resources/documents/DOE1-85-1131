<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-85-1131 </DOCNO><TEXT>The X-ray and gamma-ray spectra expected from SN 1987A have been calculated.Results for the TWOBF7 model are inconsistent with Ginga observation,but the X-ray flux and its spectral shape strongly depend on the chemicalcomposition and expansion velocity of the ejecta. The distributions ofdensity and chemical compositions for SN 1987A are described. For theTWOBF7 model, the X-ray flux between 10 and 20 keV reaches a peak of6.7 photons/s/sq m about 1 yr after the explosion. For the 15B5 model,the peak flux is larger by a factor of five. The implications of theGinga satellite's detection of an excess X-ray flux from the directionof the supernova for the models of SN 1987A are considered. How observationsof gamma-ray lines can determine the optical thickness of the expandingshell is discussed. 22 references.</TEXT></DOC>
