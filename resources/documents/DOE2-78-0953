The test shows thatthe magnet achieved about 90% of the &quot;short-sample&quot; performance withouttraining. The recovery of the normal zone has been observed till G =0.55 W/cm/sup 2/. At higher magnet current, the normal zone propagateswith quite high velocity, so the magnet could be also self-protective.</TEXT></DOC>
