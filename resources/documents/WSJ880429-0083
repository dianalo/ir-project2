In the bond market, prices of long-term Treasury issues sank to their lowest levels in about 2 1/2 months. Some 30-year government bonds dropped about seven-eighths of a point, or $8.75 for each $1,000 face amount.    Although wage increases generally have been moderate, many investment managers remain far more concerned about inflation than the possibility of recession. Some fear the economy is heading for both sluggish growth and higher inflation, or &quot;stagflation.&quot;    Fearful that borrowing costs will continue rising, some large companies have been scrambling to raise funds in the bond market. About $1.5 billion of new issues hit the market yesterday, including a $500 million issue by International Business Machines Corp.    As of late yesterday, the most actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds yielded 9.10%. That was up from 9.02% Wednesday and was the highest since Jan. 12. Most short-term rates also rose, adding to fears that banks soon will raise their prime lending rate. The prime, or base, rate has been 8 1/2% since early February.    &quot;It all started with the jobless claims&quot; report yesterday morning by the Labor Department, said Robert H. Chandross, a vice president at Lloyds Bank in New York.    That report, which rarely has much impact on the bond markets, showed an unexpectedly large drop in initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits during the week ended April 16. Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 275,000 from 314,000 the previous week.    Although some analysts argue that weekly figures such as this can be misleading, bond prices quickly slumped and continued sliding throughout the day. Several traders concluded that the figures might be a signal that the Labor Department's monthly employment report, to be released a week from today, also will show strength.    Another strong monthly employment report could persuade the Federal Reserve to drive up short-term interest rates slightly further. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that if the unemployment rate drops much more, that could trigger inflationary pressures. Several Fed officials say privately that they pay more attention to the monthly employment report than any other single government statistic, even the monthly trade balance.    The next regularly scheduled meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee is May 17. But a credit-tightening move could come sooner than that, analysts say, especially if the employment report next week provides additional confirmation of the economy's resilience.    &quot;I don't think it's clear just yet that the Fed will tighten -- but every piece of strong economic data increases the probability they (Fed officials) will move further,&quot; said Mr. Chandross of Lloyds Bank. &quot;The market is concerned that a whole series of strong economic reports will inevitably force their hand.&quot;    A few Fed officials are reluctant to tighten credit any further because they consider inflation fears to be exaggerated, especially since commodity prices have remained well under control. Some private economists also fear another round of credit-tightening could damage the economy and possibly lead to a replay of last October's stock market collapse.    Before the release of the initial claims report yesterday morning, bond prices drifted aimlessly in very light activity, as they had all week. But the calm quickly was shattered. The Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 wound up late yesterday at 97 22/32, down from 98 1/2 Wednesday. The government's 8 1/8% notes due 1998 fell to 95 5/32 from 95 20/32, while the yield increased to 8.87% from 8.80%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 8.91 points to 1237.26. That also was the low for the day. The high was 1244.05.    Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills, which declined earlier this week, reversed direction yesterday. As of late yesterday, three-month Treasury bills were quoted at 5.98% bid, up from 5.86% Wednesday, and six-month bills were quoted at 6.35% bid, up from 6.22%.    The federal funds rate also climbed, averaging about 7 1/8%. That was up from 6.83% Wednesday. Several specialists said the increase in the funds rate, which is the rate on overnight loans between banks, probably was caused merely by temporary technical pressures. The funds rate often is distorted at this time of year because of big flows of funds associated with federal income tax payments.    Several analysts expect the funds rate to drift back down to the 6 3/4% to 6 7/8% area soon. But some also predict the Fed eventually will push the funds rate to 7% in an effort to demonstrate its commitment to containing inflation pressure. </TEXT></DOC>
