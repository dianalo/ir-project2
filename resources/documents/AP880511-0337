Byrd, D-W.Va., said at a congressional bill-signingceremony.   The signing and a Capitol Hill rally held outside Democraticnational headquarters were parts of a show of political muscleorchestrated by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, as a sendoff forthe bill before it goes to the president's desk.   With 15 television cameras trained on him and scores of baffledtourists wandering through, Wright signed the massive bill at aceremony in ornate Statuary Hall near the House chamber. Supportersof the legislation applauded and Wright passed out pens that wereused in the ceremony.   Senate President Pro Tempore John Stennis, D-Miss., was expectedto sign the measure quickly and return it to Wright for delivery tothe White House. Democratic leaders indicated they planned to haveit there by the end of the week.   Wednesday's ceremonies clearly were aimed at casting the bill ina flattering light and thus make a veto sound all the more harsh.   Democrats said the issue was bound to strike a resonant chord onthe campaign trail. Party Chairman Paul Kirk said voters would``rally to the banner of the Democratic Party'' in House and Senateraces.   On hand for the rally were lawmakers, their aides, religious andlabor leaders and a handful of laid-off workers brought in by theAFL-CIO for the occasion. Republicans were absent.   At the bill's signing, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., thechairman of the House-Senate conference committee that drew up thebill, urged Reagan to sign the measure.   There have been recurrent reports of friction betweenRostenkowski and Wright over provisions of the bill that appearedto guarantee a veto. Notable among them has been a featurerequiring companies with at least 100 employees to give 60-daynotice of plant closings and major layoffs.   Rostenkowski's office said he had not been invited to the rally.``But our nose isn't out of joint about it and neither should yoursbe,'' press secretary Jim Jaffe said. He said the affair was``being blown up.''   In explaining his veto plan, Reagan has pinpointed theplant-closings provision as well as the bill's curbs on Alaska oilexports.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reaffirmed thatReagan will veto the bill.   The trade bill was one of the items discussed by Reagan in aprivate meeting with Republican leaders of Congress. Afterward,talking with reporters in the White House driveway, Senate MinorityLeader Bob Dole, R-Kan., expressed confidence that the veto will besustained.   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill, said that afterReagan's veto is upheld, the House could move ``very quickly'' toenact a replacement bill, minus the provisions on Alaskan oil andplant-closing notification.   The centerpiece of the bill are provisions that would overhaulthe system under which the United States uses trade restrictions toaid U.S. industries threatened by imports and retaliate againstinternational trade violations. For example, authority to orderretaliatory tariffs and quotas would be transferred from thepresident to the U.S. trade representative.   The bill has hundreds of other provisions, ranging from apotential $2 billion in agricultural subsidies to repeal of thewindfall profits tax on oil company earnings.   At the rally, Wright described House Majority Leader ThomasFoley, D-Wash., as ``the architect'' of the legislation. Foley saidthe support of Americans for the plant-closings feature were``indicated in every poll.'' But he did not cite any specific pollresults and a morning news conference at which pollsters weresupposed to release results was canceled.   The legislation passed the House 312-107, a margin more thanenough to override the expected veto. But it won final passage inthe Senate on April 27 three votes short of the two-thirds neededfor an override, and Democrats were still uncertain of just wherethey would find the additional support.   ``We'll consult the stars,'' Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., saidwryly.   The bill won final passage on April 27 but has been sitting onCapitol Hill while the Democrats tried in vain to win over twovotes for a veto override by reopening the measure and strippingout its restrictions on Alaska oil exports.</TEXT></DOC>
