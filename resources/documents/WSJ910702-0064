In asking the U.S. Supreme Court to consider overturning aruling that had invalidated the company's patent, Geneticsyesterday delivered the court a petition written by HarvardUniversity Law professors Laurence H. Tribe and CharlesFried.</LP><TEXT>   The move is the latest round in a long-running patentbattle between Cambridge, Mass.-based Genetics and competitorAmgen Inc., based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., over the rightsto the drug erythropoietin (EPO).   In March, the court that usually has the final word onpatents, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,blocked Genetics from selling its version of EPO. The courtruled that Genetics' patent was invalid because it failed toshow how to make the drug with the claimed degree of purity.   The court upheld Amgen's claim to the patent, thus ineffect granting it a monopoly over domestic sales to kidneydialysis patients. The decision was a boon to Amgen but ablow to Genetics, which had been counting on revenue bothfrom royalties on U.S. sales and from manufacturing the drugin the U.S. for European sales.   Messrs. Tribe and Fried are seen as a potent combinationthat is likely, at the very least, to get the High Court'sattention. Mr. Tribe, usually associated with politicallyliberal causes, is one of the most successful Supreme Courtadvocates of the past decade. Mr. Fried, a conservative, is aformer U.S. Solicitor General, the Justice Department's chiefadvocate at the Supreme Court.   Nonetheless, in large part because the separate FederalCircuit makes final rulings in most patent cases, the SupremeCourt seldom agrees to hear such disputes. And some observerspredict that the Genetics petition represents a long shot,despite the presence of Messrs. Tribe and Fried.   In the petition filed yesterday, Messrs. Tribe and Friedargued, among other things, that the ruling by the FederalCircuit violated the patent clause of the U.S. Constitutionand exceeded the lower court's jurisdiction.   The constitution's patent clause gives exclusive rights toan invention for 17 years but also requires that the inventorpublicly disclose how the invention works. The petition thusargues that in order to get a patent, genetic engineers mustmake available to the public samples of laboratory-createdmicroorganisms and written directions for making thelife-forms. The Federal Circuit ruled that only writtendirections were necessary, which Mr. Tribe contended was anillegitimate exemption to the patent clause.   In an interview, Mr. Tribe said the federal constitutionalissue is &quot;whether the federal courts have the authority tograft exemptions onto&quot; the patent clause. &quot;It's Congress'sduty to carve out exemptions,&quot; Mr. Tribe said.   Based on the Federal Circuit's decision, a trial ondamages for patent infringement by Genetics is pending infederal trial court in Boston. If Genetics wins in theSupreme Court, however, it will avoid the possibility ofhefty damages to Amgen. Also, it would put itself in aposition to gain a patent that covers the process of makingEPO, Genetics said.   Meanwhile yesterday, Amgen asked the federal trial courtin Boston to order Genetics not to produce EPO for domesticuse and to put $13 million into escrow to cover potentialdamages. A Genetics spokeswoman said the company isn'tproducing any EPO for domestic use and already has put aside$11 million for damages.   Concerning the Supreme Court petition, Amgen said it is&quot;considered unlikely that the Supreme Court will grant thispetition and also very unlikely that Genetics will prevail ifthe petition were granted.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
