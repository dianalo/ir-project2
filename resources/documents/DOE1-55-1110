The second algorithm,an on-line planning algorithm, at the same time, selects the currenttarget state and the current forbidden joint coordinates for the firstalgorithm. Since the task is a point to point transfer movement, theproblem is dealt in robot joint space directly and the kinematic problemcan be bypassed completely. A simulation example using a 2 degree-of-freedomplanner robot is given. 12 references.</TEXT></DOC>
