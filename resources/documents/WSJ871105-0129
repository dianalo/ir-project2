The Journal has carried this torch for some time. Apparently the torch has been so bright that you have been blinded to the realities that a simple lesson in political economy provides.    Overexpansion of the public sector has a simple cause. Individual government spending programs concentrate their benefits in the hands of a few. At the same time our tax system disperses the costs of these programs among the many. Members of spending constituencies have every incentive to lobby for their particular programs. The average taxpayer, however, has every incentive to remain silent. The political deck is stacked against fiscal restraint.    The efficacy of the line-item veto centers on the notion that the executive branch has an inherent immunity to these political realities. This is a mind-boggling notion. Regardless of whether there is a line-item veto, benefits from spending programs are still concentrated relative to costs. Why should a president respond to this skewed lobbying pressure any differently than 535 congressmen and senators currently do? Indeed, the asymmetry in the lobbying effort would be more pronounced with a line-item veto, because the effort would focus on only one person, the president.    Although many would claim that Ronald Reagan is a president who would resist such lobbying efforts, it's important to remember that the line-item veto would outlive the Reagan presidency.    Cecil E.
