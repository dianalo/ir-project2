It's alove-hate relationship with heavy machinery.   The vice president appears to be perpetually climbing intocockpits of airplanes, easing himself behind the wheels of trucksand farm equipment, climbing into boats, pulling levers on assemblylines and donning helmets, hard hats and laboratory smocks.   Hardly a campaign day goes by without at least one carefullyorchestrated event in which Bush gets a chance to pose for camerasinside, around or on top of some form of heavy equipment.   Plant visits are standard campaign fare, and Democraticfront-runner Michael Dukakis has been doing his own share offactory tours. But Bush, without any Republican opposition to worryabout, seems to have more time to squeeze such events into hisschedule. And he approaches machinery with a certain gusto all hisown.   But not all of Bush's encounters with technology are successful.   At a Procter and Gamble plant near Cincinnati, Bush pressed aswitch to start a machine that sent toothpaste flowing through alabyrinth of pipes. He was invited to hold a waiting emptytootpaste tube, its bottom open, under a spigot.   A quizzical expression flashed across his face as only a fewdrops trickled into his tube, while a torrent of the green gooeystuff gushed out of a nearby pipe into a waste barrel.   At the General Dynamics aircraft production plant in Fort Worth,Texas, Bush climbed inside a flight simulater to ``fly'' an F-16fighter jet. But the former World War II torpedo bomber pilotadmitted sheepishly afterward that he had brought the plane downtoo hard on the runway, unintentionally simulating a near-crashlanding.   Bush dresses up _ or down _ as each occasion warrants, so flightjackets and pilot helmets appear for those frequent climbs intoaircraft cockpits. At a semiconductor plant in Oregon, Bush wasgarbed in a ``full FAB bunny suit,'' special head-to-toe overallsdesigned to keep dust at a minimum.   But even for Bush there are limits. After all, there are stillthose ``wimp'' accusations that come up from time to time.   So on a tour of the Hershey chocolate factory in Pennsylvania,reporters, Secret Service agents and Bush aides were ordered to donhairnets (a gesture to cleanliness), while the vice president wasallowed to cover his head with a hard hat.   Unlike Walter Mitty, the James Thurber character who could onlydaydream of a secret life, Bush gets to act out other people's jobs_ at least for the duration of a five or 10-minute ``photoopportunity.''   At the Cleveland Clinic, Bush donned a white medical coat andheld a mechanical heart in his hands as he conferred with a groupof physicians and researchers. Bush said he thought the heartseemed awfully heavy, suggesting the patient would have to be``fairly robust.''   That is a potential problem, he was told. It was one site whereBush wasn't invited to participate further.   He toured an IBM center in Thornwood, N.Y., and was given anexhibit of a computer-aided robotics manufacturing system andwatched as a robot arm assembled a delicate piece of equipment. Didhe want to take a stab at making the robot reassemble the device?   ``I don't know what the hell it is,'' Bush confessed.   At Fort Wayne, Bush toured a plant that makes military radios.He was invited to get behind the wheel of a Jeep to inspect one. Hepromptly climbed into the passenger seat instead _ possiblyexhibiting a long-ingrained vice presidential tendency.   A few days later, Bush helped drive a few rivets into a``Hummer,'' the all-purpose military vehicle that is replacing theJeep, and was invited to take one out for a spin.   ``I'm going to get in the right side of the car this time,'' hejoked.   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said the candidate'sfrequent visits to plants are intended to ``show clearly that he isconcerned about the economy as it relates to people, toindividuals... You can talk about jobs, but it's important torelate to people on a personal level.''   The campaign also wants to suggest that Bush is looking to thefuture and that's why high-tech plants are favored, Fuller said.``These are jobs that are going to lead up to the 21st Century,''he said.   But sometimes even nature seems to conspire against Bush.   There he was, in an open barn on a family farm in southeasternIdaho, ready to go out and inspect some irrigation equipment inthis dry region of the country where it almost never rains.   It poured.</TEXT></DOC>
