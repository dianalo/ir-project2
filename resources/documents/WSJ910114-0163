But the cheers died out fast.</LP><TEXT>   The Indian development company, named after two Oklahomatribes, had trouble sewing the complicated suits. Since itcouldn't deliver, it couldn't get paid. When chemical warfarebecame an immediate threat in the Persian Gulf, the Armybrought in other suppliers and canceled half of the contract.Result: Sac andamp; Fox workers in Temple, at least temporarily,are out of work.   The Sac andamp; Fox cancellation highlights an unpleasant factof life for the numerous small businesses supplying OperationDesert Shield. The business may seem like a boon, but it isfull of risks. As war clouds gather, a company may suddenlybe subject to pressures and deadlines that it is ill-equippedto meet. But if the political climate changes, the work coulddry up overnight.   Businesses that have won contracts say the business isanything but a soft touch. &quot;We don't make $450 hammers here,&quot;says Warren Dotson, a vice president at Centre ManufacturingCo. in Centre, Ala. &quot;We make a $45 coat.&quot;   Centre expects to ship the first of its desert camouflagefield jackets in late January. By that time, of course, thenation may be at war -- or at peace. Because the DefenseLogistics Agency needed the jackets yesterday, but perhapswon't need them tomorrow, it is furiously recruitingadditional suppliers -- potential competitors for Centre --and insisting on its standard right to cancel the contract atany time.   Would-be Desert Shield suppliers solicit the agency daily,says Lloyd Alderman, its acting small-business director.&quot;They want to know what guarantees I can give them that Icould help them out down the road,&quot; he sighs. His answer: &quot;Nopromises.&quot;   Industry has responded nonetheless, Mr. Alderman says,partly because the government does promise to reimburse thecontractors' costs, even if it cancels. Besides, the militarywill be replenishing its stores, even if Saddam Hussein backsdown. And in the case of desert gear, it will be belatedlybuilding stockpiles.   Yet the field is loaded with pressures, and businessowners sometimes end up taking a gamble on the outcome. Thelogistics agency faced a major crunch in supplying fieldrations for its Operation Desert Shield forces. Thegovernment pushed the eight companies that pack MREs(Pentagon talk for Meals/Ready to Eat) to an annualproduction rate of 24 million cases from three million. Eventhen, the agency wound up supplementing its supply withcommercial versions of the MRE boxed meals, like Hormel's TopShelf and Dial's Lunch Bucket entrees.   The suppliers of the Army's field-kitchen staples facedeven tougher demands. From a monthly production of 200,000T-rations, tray containers serving 18 soldiers, T-rationcompanies moved to one million per month. At that point, theybumped up against the maximum capacity at Cincinnati-basedCentral States Can Co., the only producer of a rectangularcan designed to drop directly into a field kitchen steamtable.   The Army offered to pay for an expansion, says CentralStates manager Daniel P. Hines. But the company decided touse $1 million of its own money to hasten a doubling of itscapacity, it hopes, by next May. Mr. Hines concedes, &quot;We'rehoping after all this is over that T-rations will berecognized as a superior system.&quot; In Berkeley, Ill., VaneeFoods also used $1.5 million of its own money to expand itsT-ration packing capacity.   Of course, even a brief boom is welcome to many defensecontractors who had already been feeling the business effectsas the Cold War ended. By July of last year, reduced ordersfor combat boots had forced McRae Industries Inc. to lay off100 of its 220 employees in Wadeville, N.C. The drought endedabruptly in August, with a frantic plea from the logisticsagency for $8 million of footwear. Company owner BransonMcRae says he expects to win a second contract this week forboots designed especially for desert warfare.   Mr. McRae is so confident that he already has purchasedleather and canvas. &quot;My bet is that we will maintain a forcein the Persian Gulf for the next 30 years,&quot; he says. He alsobelieves that the military will think twice before makingdeep cuts in its basic suppliers.   But as the Sac andamp; Fox workers can attest, the governmentactually means it when it says &quot;no promises.&quot; The governmentfrantically recruited four new companies to tackle the suits,comprising a needle-defying exterior fabric and a messycharcoal foam liner, and subject to exacting qualitystandards.   Sac andamp; Fox spent 40% of its production time inquality-assurance tasks, says President James R. Branum. Hesays the government then held the suits for an additional 30days for inspection, flunked some of his production and heldup payments of $450,000. The defects cited were the wrongshading of green camouflage, he claims. &quot;The governmentshould slack off on the aesthetic questions,&quot; he grumbles,although he concedes that Sac andamp; Fox has met less than half ofits delivery requirements.   &quot;We need the suits, but we also have a signed, validcontract,&quot; said Frank Johnson, a spokeman for the DefensePersonnel Support Center in Philadelphia, a unit of theDefense Logistics Agency in charge of the chemical protectionsuits.   Mr. Branum expects to be back in business in Temple andthe company's three other plants within two weeks.   But the world moves quickly in two weeks. The governmentscaled back the chemical-suit production when the Berlin Wallfell, notes John Nicholson, whose Tennessee Apparel Corp. isone of the new contractors. &quot;Certainly there's no need to buya lot of the items if the Gulf crisis ends,&quot; he says. &quot;We'llsee some of it reduced.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
