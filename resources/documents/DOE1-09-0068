<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-09-0068 </DOCNO><TEXT>The spatial and temporal distribution of radiation dose to tissues ofthree species of animals was defined following inhalation of one of threeparticulate materials representative of aerosols produced in the manufactureof mixed uranium and plutonium oxide nuclear fuel. Rats, dogs and monkeysreceived a single inhalation exposure to one of three materials and groupsof five rats, two dogs or one monkey were sacrificed at selected timesup to four years after exposure. The three aerosol materials used werea mixture of UO{sub 2} and PuO{sub 2} powders treated at 750{sup 0}C,a solid solution of (U,Pu)O{sub 2} treated at 1750{sup 0}C, and PuO{sub2} treated at 850{sup 0}C. The data defining retention, distributionand excretion of plutonium and americium present in these materials werecompared using a biokinetic model to highlight similarities and differences.Lung retention of the plutonium component of these particulates for anyone of the three species was not different. In contrast, lung retentionof the plutonium component was dependent on the species of animal, apparentlydue to differences in the rate of mucociliary clearance. The synthesisof information from each aerosol and each species studied indicated thatradiation dose distribution in tissue was essentially the same as thatmeasured in animals exposed by inhalation to laboratory-produced aerosolsof PuO{sub 2}. There was no indication that the hazard to humans exposedto these industrial materials would be appreciably different than hasbeen estimated for laboratory-produced aerosols of PuO{sub 2}. 28 refs.,12 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
