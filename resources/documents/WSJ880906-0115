Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.    In its September issue, Liberty Report attacked Sassy for the second time in recent months, concluding its article with the names and addresses of three of Sassy's biggest advertisers -- Tambrands Inc., Revlon Group Inc. and Levi Strauss andamp; Co., already a target of Liberty Report's effort.    The July issue of Liberty Report had kicked off the campaign against Sassy, supplying the addresses of Schering Plough Corp., maker of Maybelline cosmetics; Noxell Corp., maker of Cover Girl and Noxema products; and Levi Strauss. Schering-Plough and Noxell said last week they won't advertise in Sassy in the foreseeable future. Levi Strauss said it has an ad scheduled for Sassy's November issue but none after that.    Sassy, a magazine for teen-age girls, was launched in March. It is owned by New York-based Matilda Publications Inc., which also owns Ms. magazine. Sassy's frankness about sexual and social topics, including abortion, homosexuality and virginity, provoked criticism from the beginning. But it also attracted readers. Sassy's ad rate base has jumped from 250,000 to 400,000 in just seven issues.    None of the advertisers targeted by Liberty Report, based in Lynchburg, Va., said they had ceased advertising in Sassy because of pressure from letter writers.    A spokeswoman for Noxell said the company had made its decision independently. &quot;We decided some of the content wasn't appropriate for young teens,&quot; she said. A Schering-Plough spokesman confirmed that the company had no ads scheduled in Sassy this year or next, but wouldn't give any reason for its decision.    Paul Konney, vice president of Tambrands, said the company has received fewer than 20 letters so far, which he described as &quot;a small but unusual number for us because we get very little correspondence about our advertising.&quot; Mr. Konney said the company has an ad scheduled for the September issue, but even before receiving any letters hadn't planned to advertise in Sassy for the rest of the year.    Liberty Report's September article quotes Mr. Konney as saying that the company's ad agency will take another look at Sassy's content to see if it is acceptable for &quot;a respectable company.&quot;    At Levi Strauss, Dean Christon, a marketing specialist, said the company has received some 50 letters about Sassy. The campaign prompted Levi Strauss to ask its ad agency to review the magazine. &quot;We're going to monitor it a little closer than other magazines because it's frank,&quot; Mr. Christon said. &quot;But we haven't knocked them off our list.&quot;    Daniel Moriarty, a spokesman for Revlon, said the company had already received some letters complaining about Sassy. &quot;Anything like that makes you pause for a moment,&quot; Mr. Moriarty said.    The campaign against Sassy began in Wabash, Ind., where two women succeeded in getting the magazine removed from a local supermarket and a drugstore. The women wrote to Liberty Report suggesting that it alert its 150,000 to 200,000 readers to Sassy's frank editorial content.    Sandra Yates, president of Matilda Publications, said the impact of the lost advertising will be felt in Sassy's November and December issues, which will carry 30 pages of ads rather than the 36 or 37 pages planned. But she said Sassy has just signed up a major fashion advertiser, which will provide more revenue than Maybelline, formerly its biggest advertiser.    Ms. Yates said without the letter-writing campaign, the magazine would be doing &quot;incredibly well.&quot; To Ms. Yates, a native Australian, the whole episode has come as a &quot;terrible shock,&quot; she said. &quot;I thought you guys believed all that stuff about free speech.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
