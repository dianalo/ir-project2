Schmidt, a computer architecturespecialist with Architecture Technology Corp., a Minneapolis company thatassisted FAA in the accuisition and evaluation of the LCN.andM;Phil DeCara, the manager of FAA's automation research and development branch,describes the LCN as the &quot;glue that ties the processing elements of the AAStogether and .andP;  .  .  the vehicle that will allow us to implement futureupgrades in manageable incremental steps.&quot;andM;&quot;As the processing elements wear out or become obsolete, a standards-basedLCN appears to offer the best solution for replacing these elements with theleast trauma to the system and software architecture,&quot; the FAA official said.andM;If FAA appears to put too fine a point on the terminology, it is because theconsiderations of reliability, availability and maintainability helped tipthe contract in IBM's favor.andP;  These are the same considerations the agencyextended to its requirements for the LCN.andM;&quot;The agency was looking for something more reliable, more extensive than anygiven single LAN today could provide,&quot; Schmidt said.andM;&quot;The whole context of the LCN was to support a concept in AAS calledcommonality.andP;  This was a term that was coined to mean the use of commoncomponents across the whole system so you would have the ability to replicatethe use of components such as processors, displays and so on,&quot; Schmidt said.andM;Easy Add-onsandM;Described by former FAA Administrator Allan McArtor as the &quot;largestreal-time, computer-controlled system ever developed,&quot; the distributedprocessing environment of the AAS will allow new hardware to be brought onwithout disturbing the rest of the system, once the interface to the networkhas been established.andM;&quot;With a certain number of air traffic controllers in a room and eachresponsible for a given air space, it was felt that providing them their owncomputing capability was considered just a good system design technique.andP;  Sothe use of a distributed approach was encouraged and the use of the LCN was arequirement of the AAS,&quot; Schmidt said.andM;Schmidt said that when FAA officials wrote the specifications for the LCN,they had to guess the direction the Open Systems Interconnection standardswould take.andP;  The officials had no way of knowing that the token-ringprotocols would be incorporated into the seven-layer reference model forinteroperable communications.andM;The only other prime vendor for the AAS contract, Hughes Aircraft Co. ofFullerton, Calif., proposed during the design competition a 100-megabit/secnetworking scheme that was based on the Fiber Distributed Data Interface, thespecifications for data transmission at 100 megabits/sec over optical fiberusing a token-ring protocol, Schmidt said.andM;Under FAA's plans there will be 23 area control facilities across the countryand each will have its LCN, which will consist of multiple 802.5 token-ringnetworks interconnected by bridges.andM;Common consoles based on the IBM RT UNIX workstation will be configured inclusters of two to four consoles, an arrangement FAA officials call sectorsuites.andP;  A typical area control facility might have as many as 320 commonconsoles.andM;The Ring CycleandM;Each of the common consoles will be connected to a set of four token-rings,Schmidt said, collectively called an access ring set.andP;  Each access ring setis expected to host as many as 85 common consoles, he added.andM;Meanwhile, each of the rings will be partitioned in terms of function,Schmidt said.andM;For example, one ring will be a dedicated broadcast ring for carryingprimarily surveillance information, a second will be a point-to-point ringfor carrying acknowledged messages back and forth, and the third ring willfunction as a data recording ring and will record all significant actionswithin the system for later analysis, Schmidt said.andM;The fourth ring will serve as a spare ring to supply networking capabilityshould any one of the three rings fail, he said.andM;The same four-ring configuration will be reflected in the backbone rings,which will interconnect the access ring sets via bridges.andM;The first AAS along with the LCN is to be delivered to FAA's technical centerin Atlantic City, N.J., in the first quarter of 1991 for a one-year test andevaluation.andP;  The first system the following year will be installed inSeattle.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
