ATandamp;T's proposals, which were expected, follow those of one of its major competitors, MCI Communications Corp., which filed a proposal with the Federal Communications Commission last week that also would ease restrictions on ATandamp;T. The MCI proposal was widely seen as an effort by that company to halt FCC-mandated price cuts that have forced ATandamp;T and its competitors to cut prices, thus eroding profits throughout the industry.    The requests by New York-based ATandamp;T and Washington-based MCI are in response to an FCC proposal to sharply reduce regulation of certain parts of ATandamp;T's long-distance business. Albert Halprin, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau, said he didn't know whether the commission could act on ATandamp;T's request to lift profit regulation on all its long-distance business under the current FCC proceeding.    But the FCC could probably consider as early as this summer an alternative ATandamp;T proposal that would replace profit regulation with price controls on ATandamp;T's basic long-distance service, Mr. Halprin said.    ATandamp;T proposed that in addition to lifting profit regulation, the FCC allow new rates to go into effect in 14 days instead of the current 45 days and that competitors be required to show ATandamp;T's rates are unreasonable instead of placing the burden of proof on ATandamp;T. The company also called for a reduction in the amount of documentation it must file each time it proposes a new rate or service. Larry Garfinkel, an ATandamp;T vice president, said the company envisions that its proposals for reduced regulation will last three years before it becomes fully deregulated.    In return for the reduction in regulation, ATandamp;T said that for three years it would refrain from charging more for calls placed to regions that are more costly to service. Consumer groups have feared that if deregulated, ATandamp;T would charge more to call small towns than to call between cities.    ATandamp;T also said it would maintain basic long-distance service nationwide. In addition, Mr. Garfinkel said ATandamp;T would continue to reduce rates by the same amount that its costs to connect to local phone companies fall, assuming those connection costs continue to fall.    Because Mr. Garfinkel said ATandamp;T would continue to cut prices as its connection costs fall, deregulating ATandamp;T might not stem the tide of ATandamp;T price cuts that have forced competitors to cut prices and incur losses, analysts said. The bulk of the 30% drop in ATandamp;T's long-distance rates in the past three years has resulted from reduced connection costs. In the past, ATandamp;T executives have said the company might keep some connection cost cuts for itself. Analysts said that if profits were deregulated, ATandamp;T might simply not cut prices as much as it has in the past three years.    Although ATandamp;T's incentive would be to maximize long-distance profits to offset losses in its computer and phone equipment business, &quot;if it looked like there was collusion among carriers&quot; to maintain or even increase prices, &quot;the FCC would step in and reimpose regulations, or they would push&quot; to let the Bell operating companies into the long-distance business to increase competition, said Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. ATandamp;T, MCI and other long-distance companies have vehemently opposed allowing Bell concerns into the long-distance business, fearing that the Bells would unfairly use their monopoly of local service to sell long-distance service. </TEXT></DOC>
