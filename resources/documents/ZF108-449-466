(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Computers and computer networks are tools best used for automating anyrepetitive process.andP;  This applies to things that most of the work force doesregularly like word processing or accounting, but also to highly specificfunctions associated with a single industry.andP;  These function specificindustries are known to the hardware and software vendors who exploit them asvertical markets.andM;Long before the days of LANS, vertical markets were lucrative formanufacturers precisely because they had such specific needs, and themarketplace has only gotten better since networks were introduced.andM;Take the legal profession, an example of an industry that needs asophisticated version of a common product, word processing software.andP;  Lawyersgenerate a staggering number of documents and hate to throw any of them away.andO;Word processing systems designed for law firms have evolved from the basicWang word processing mini to complex networks involving scanners for readingin documents, document managers to keep track of each version, and opticaldisk jukeboxes for archiving.andM;Similarly, a factory needs to control the assembly floor process, and itssystem could include everything from bar code readers to robots on thefactory floor.andM;As in the legal field, networks are becoming prevalent enough in factories towarrant their own protocolMAP or Manufacturing Automation Protocol.andP;  Ineither legal or factory environments, networks are used to automate arepetitive process specifically associated with that industry.andM;The healthcare industry as a whole, and hospitals specifically, defies thatsimple definition of a vertical market.andP;  Hospitals, although they have uniquefunctions, have so many of them that systems designed for hospitals resemblebusiness applications more than vertical markets applications.andP;  A hospitalnot only has to track patients, but must order supplies, schedule shifts,file insurance claims, and bill patients, among other tasks.andP;  Many hospitalsalso interface with private practices to speed the whole admissions process.andO;The future holds more than just these basically administrative processes,however.andP;  In the very near future, networks will also be used in diagnosticapplications.andP;  Making Its First StridesandM;Networks have been slower in acceptance in the hospital environment than inthe rest of the business world, although the evolutionary process has beensimilar.andP;  For years hospitals used mainframes because they were the onlysolution available, and also because they happened to be ideal fororchestrating all their functions.andP;  As a result, all the early medicalsoftwareandM;was  written  for  the mainframe.andM;The demand for PCs in the hospital has only arisen in the last three or fouryears, according to Dr. Richard Covert, associate director of the HealthcareInformation and Management System Society of the American HospitalAssociation.andP;  &quot;When the cost of a micro got down to the point where they wereaffordable, departments began acquiring standalone machines with standaloneapplications,&quot; says Covert.andP;  &quot;Unfortunately, they ended up with severaldifferent types of hardware and software, and nothing could communicate withany degree of fluency, nor did they connect easily to the mini or host usedin the hospital.&quot;andM;There is definitely a demand for something that would allow standalone PCs tocommunicate with the hosts and one another.andP;  To further that end, a newprotocol designed specifically for medical applications is under development.andO;The protocol, HL7, is the first attempt to develop a standard for data setsin health care.andM;Medical software written to HL7 specifications will use standard fieldlengths and placements to allow information to be transferred without anyproblems inherent in doing that now.andP;  &quot;Up until now, to make use of disparatesoftware, you had to write a custom interface,&quot; says Covert.andP;  &quot;That can beexpensive and time consuming.andP;  HL7 is the first major step towards networkingon a hospitalwide basis.&quot; Not All Are WaitingandM;Not all hospitals are waiting for the development of a standard to takeadvantage of networking.andP;  St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston is astate-of-the-art facility that is using networks in conjunction with itsmainframes to run every facet of its operations.andM;St.andP;  Luke's is a 949-bed institution founded in 1954 and located in the Texasmedical center.andP;  They have 4,100 employees and 320 volunteers that care forabout 31,000 inpatients, 8,000 outpatients, and 19,000 emergency patientseach year.andP;  In excess of 4,000 procedures are performed yearly in thecardiovascular operating suite.andP;  The hospital's specialties includeorthopedics, neurology, neurosurgery, high risk obstetrics, gastroenterology,hematology, urology, hand  surgery, pulmonary, and oncology.andM;St.andP;  Luke's Episcopal is also a teaching hospital affiliated with the TexasHeart Institute, Baylor College, and the University of Texas Health ScienceCenter at Houston Medical School.andP;  Altogether St. Luke's has a medical staffof 1,400 doctors, more than 60 percent of whom have teaching appointments.andO;Among the physicians based at St. Luke's is Dr. Denton Cooley, the celebratedcardiovascular surgeon.andM;According to John Sabo, administrative director of Respiratory Care at St.andO;Luke's, the hospital has always made extensive use of its IBM mainframe.andO;They are now in the process of implementing more than a dozen networks, bothon the administrative and clinical sides of the hospital, that willcommunicate with the mainframe and with one another.andM;The major purpose of the networks is to assimilate clinical information onpatients and their treatments for use in documentation, work assignments,ordering procedures, report generation, charge capture, billing, auditing,recordkeeping, quality assurance, and some personnel communications.andP;  Thenetworks will also meet the standard business needs of the hospital, such asword processing and spreadsheet analysis.andP;  &quot;We can perform the businessfunctions for no more than the cost of the clinical network,&quot; says Sabo.andO;&quot;We're merging the whole operation.&quot;andM;Hospitals are organized into four basic areas, according to Sabo: the medicalstaff, nursing staff, business operations, and ancillary departments.andP;  Thelatter two are the primary focus of the networking effort at St. Luke's.andO;Just Like Fed ExandM;Ancillary departments are those that treat patients as the result ofphysicians' orders, such as physical therapy, respiratory care, or radiology.andO;The trend in healthcare today is towards the development of more and moresophisticated ancillary information systems.andP;  Ancillary departments resemblevertical markets within the vertical markets.andM;The ancillary departments at St. Luke's with networks in place includecardiology, physical therapy, and radiology.andP;  &quot;Whether it's two nodes or 25,the efficiency of networks is becoming essential to clinical departments,&quot;says Sabo.andM;The two major clinical PC-based systems in place are in the respiratorytherapy lab and the cardiac catheterization lab.andM;The catheterization lab, which happens to be the largest one in the world,has a 40-node network.andP;  Like all the networks at St. Luke's, it is a TokenRing network running Netware 386.andM;St.andP;  Luke's chose Token Ring because it already had the IBM mainframe andwanted to be able to maintain some sort of standardization so that futurenetworks could be easily connected.andP;  &quot;Token Ring just seemed to be thenatural choice,&quot; says Carol Lamb, manager of network services at St. Luke's.andM;The respiratory lab is a 26-node Token Ring, with a Compaq SystemPro 840 fileserver.andP;  There is also a backup server with a hard disk that mirrors theprimary server.andP;  The majority of the nodes are Compaq 386s, with a sprinklingof IBM PS/2s.andM;A Token Ring-to-ethernet bridge is also being implemented to connect therespiratory lab to the pulmonary function lab.andP;  Clinical equipment such asblood analyzing devices will also be interfaced to the respiratory network.andM;Mainframe connectivity is provided through DCA 3270 emulation boardsinstalled in seven machines (see Figure 1).andP;  Several of these nodes arelocated outside the department at nursing stations.andP;  These nodes also includelight pens for mainframe menu selection and share functionality with nursingservices.andM;Each ancillary department needs to track a patient through a system, keepingtrack of information, such as patient identification, treatmentsadministered, results, and so on.andP;  Randy Scheib, president of NationalMediServe, the Irvine, Calif.-based installer responsible for implementingseveral of the ancillary networks at St. Luke's, likens the process to theFederal Express system.andP;  &quot;Federal Express is a $10 billion company thatdelivers 875,000 packages a day, and they can tell you within a matter ofminutes where any package is,&quot; says Scheib.andP;  &quot;It's the same thing in ahospital.andP;  We're tracking a patient through a healthcare delivery system.&quot;andM;The analogy isn't just an illustrative one: The therapists in the ancillarydepartments at St. Luke's use the same handheld bar code readers that theFederal Express delivery people use, only St. Luke's therapists use them tocollect patient information.andM;The bar codes are generated through a Hewlett-Packard Laserjet printer with aworklist that identifies the therapist, patient, and each procedure or supplythat is to be provided.andP;  The therapists first scan their own bar codes thatpermit them to log on to the handheld machine.andP;  They then scan theirpatients' codes and a separate list of charting bar codes that measure thepatients' response to certain treatments.andM;The therapists then download the information from the handheld bar codereader to a network node.andP;  The network nodes are conveniently placedaccording to the workflow patterns of the therapists in each unit or floor.andO;&quot;The current affordability of PCs creates a situation to increase theproductivity of healthcare personnel,&quot; says Scheib.andP;  &quot;We put the nodeswherever there's a concentration of work, and the utilization of hand-heldPcs enables data collection and documentation to be completed at thepatient's bedside.&quot;andM;The information in bar code readers, such as patient identification, type andduration of treatments administered, who administered them, and how much timeit took, is fed into the LAN and used for everything from billing toinventory control.andP;  Says Scheib, &quot;Having uniform responses also gives themthe ability to generate quality assurance reports.&quot;andM;Users of the ancillary department networks include not only therapists whointeract indirectly with the network through the handheld computers, butsupervisors and secretaries, who make direct use of the LAN for basic officefunctions such as scheduling and word processing.andP;  Approximately 100 peoplewere trained to use the respiratory network, with about 30 people using it oneach shift.andM;The Extended NetworkandM;St.andP;  Luke's networks span two major buildings on one campus, and a fiberOptic backbone connects the ancillary departments, the mainframe, and theadministrative networks.andP;  Networks on the business side of the hospitalinclude a materials information and ordering system and an accounting system.andM;Although the clinical and business networks don't communicate at this timeexcept through the mainframe, future plans for the network might includeconnecting to a new professional office building on campus so that physicianscould have direct access to information on the network.andM;St.andP;  Luke's extended network is critical in that users need to be able toenter, if not access, information 24 hours a day.andP;  The mainframe is scheduledfor a half-hour of downtime for maintenance daily, during which time any dataentered is stored in a buffer.andP;  The longest tolerable length of downtime is afew hours, according to Sabo.andP;  After that, things like shift reports becomedelayed.andM;Users are trained an average of eight hours as part of an extensiveorientation process.andP;  The users are trained not only on the network but onthe mainframe terminals and handheld computers as well.andP;  In general, thehospital staff has had little trouble assimilating to the new network sincethey've been used to using some sort of computer in their daily routine.andO;Practical ManagementandM;The medical world is a business like any other, in which patients are boththe consumers and the products.andP;  Private practices need to schedule and billpatients, as well as keep track of their own schedules, accounts, andpersonnel.andP;  There is an abundance of practice management software on themarket, but they all basically perform the same functions.andM;Like accounting software, practice management software generally comes inmodules, ideal for networks since different modules can be loaded ontodifferent machines.andP;  Modules generally include an appointment scheduler,billing package, patients' records module, insurance claims modules, a reportwriter, and some sort of word processor, both for patient correspondence andmedical transcription.andM;A practice management system should be able to track multiple physicians in asingle practice and support several users.andP;  It should also have anaccessable, intuitive user interface.andP;  Doctors and nurses have already spentyears acquiring their specialized training.andP;  They have no desire to spendmore time learning to use a computer.andM;Accounts management is probably the single most important function in adoctor's office because of the complexities of patient billing.andP;  Patients areoften responsible for only a portion of their medical bill, so the accountingsystem has to be able to accommodate schedules both for normal billing andfor bills that are paid in some part by Medicare, a health managementorganization (HMO), or some other type of insurance.andM;A private practice's nearly constant communications with insurance companiesis often best regulated by a practice management package.andP;  Most packagesallow their users to generate insurance forms, resubmit claims, and handlepartial payment.andP;  The software also allows the practice to submit procedureestimates to insurance companies, since in some cases certain proceduresrequire pretreatment approval.andM;More and more, practices can also file insurance claims electronically, overa modem or diskette, and a good accounting module supports that operation.andO;The practice management package should support prebilling analysis, as wellas monitor batches of claims that have been submitted and their status,whether they have been accepted or rejected or have completed the billingcycle.andP;  The accounts module should maintain clear audit trails of patients'accounts, on the basis of daily and period activity.andP;  Also common to mostpractice management packages is the ability to track aging&quot; accounts, meaningthose with outstanding balances.andM;Doctors need to keep track of their patients' clinical histories as well astheir account histories.andP;  Most packages allow users to defines databases ofpatients and their histories, including information on treatments and drugsadministered, either on an outpatient or inpatient basis.andP;  The best packagesallow flexible definitions of these databases so physicians can maintain onlythe information useful to their specific requirements.andM;The appointment module lets a doctor's office maintain a more organized wayof scheduling patients.andP;  A complete module lets the user both schedule andcancel appointments, in addition to noting when an appointment has beenrescheduled.andP;  Such information that can be useful in analyzing howefficiently the practice is running.andP;  The  software  scheduler should also beable to handle unscheduled walk-ins, guard against conflicting appointments,assign intervals between appointments, define the beginning and end of theday, and reserve time for the physicians to be away from the office.andM;Equally important is the ability to generate reports based on the informationin the accounting system.andP;  All practices need to generate daily andperiodic-weekly and monthly, for example-reports, detailing all the itemsposted since the last report.andP;  Especially useful is the ability to producedreports on all accounts, whether aging or not, that have not yet been paid,complete with details on each open item.andP;  The practice should also be able togenerate reports on individual patients, including clinical and financialhistory and referring physician.andM;Finally, a word processing program lets practices not only manage thedoctors' correspondence, but allows the practice as a whole to orchestratetheir subtle direct mail campaigns.andP;  With a word processing module, users canstore a set of form letters, reminding patients how long it's been sincetheir last appointment, informing them of outstanding balances, or evenwishing simple birthday greetings.andM;There are literally hundreds of practice management packages available.andP;  Onecompany, the Cranford, N.J.andP;  based Physician Computer Network (PCN), providesa somewhat innovative service.andP;  In conjunction with several hardware vendors,including IBM and SunRiver (Jackson, Miss.), PCN provides doctors' officeswith all the necessary equipment for a physician to interface to itsinteractive clinical information network.andP;  Through the PCN, more than 15,000doctors across the country are able to access information on recentlyreleased pharmaceuticals.andM;Each physician is provided with a PS/2, equipped with a SunRiver fiber opticadapter.andP;  The 32 Mbps fiber optic network is used to carry encrypted andcompressed images of various drugs to the physician's office.andP;  The doctorsare provided with the equipment free of charge and respond to market researchquestions on each drug, which takes 10 to 15 minutes a month.andM;Untapped PotentialandM;St.andP;  Luke's Episcopal Hospital is fairly typical, if slightly more advancedthan other hospitals, in its networking strategy.andP;  The potential of networksin medicine has not yet been fully exploited, however.andP;  Computers have beenused extensively in the diagnostic imaging fields for several years.andP;  Imagesproduced through ultrasound imaging and computer tomagraphy (commonly knownas a CatScan) are naturally digitized and can be stored on standard mediasuch as magnetic or optical drives.andM;Transmitting these images over high-capacity  networks,  such  as broadbandor fiber optic metropolitan area networks (MANS), is the wave of the future,although perhaps not of the immediate future.andP;  The theory is that,eventually, doctors could view digitized images from remote sites and makediagnoses without ever having to see the patient.andM;Trials in this new field of &quot;telemedicine&quot; have been conducted over the lastfive or six years at hospitals across the country, including the GeorgetownUniversity Medical Center.andP;  Before these kinds of networks can become areality, reliable media and terminals that provide sufficient resolution mustbe developed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
