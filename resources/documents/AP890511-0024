FRAZIER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Electoral Tribunal nullified theelection late Wednesday after paramilitary forces beat theopposition presidential and vice presidential candidates with pipesand baseball bats as soldiers stood by.   Both sides had claimed victory in Sunday's balloting, whichinternational observers and the opposition claimed were rigged byforces loyal to strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who headsthe 15,000-strong Defense Forces.   ``The elections of May 7, 1989, are declared annulled in theirentirety,'' Yolanda Pulice de Rodriguez, head of the ElectoralTribunal, said in a nationwide broadcast. ``Constant vote stealingat the polls, vote buying, and missing tally sheets madeproclamation (of a new president) impossible.''   She said the outcome of the elections was ``altered by theobstructionist action by the many foreigners called in by foreignor domestic political forces without invitation.''   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega for more thana year and President Bush, charging that Noriega's forces plannedto fix the elections, had sent an uninvited U.S. delegation.   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis condemned the attack on thecandidates and said dependents of the 12,000 military anddiplomatic personnel in Panama who live off-base would be moving tomilitary bases Thursday.   ``By this action Noriega has demonstrated his contempt for thePanamanian people,'' he said.   After the election was declared null, the city went quiet astruckloads of soldiers moved into the streets. The soldierssearched any vehicle that moved as the trucks dropped squads offthroughout the city.   Calls to opposition leaders found none at home.   The government meanwhile said nothing about rescheduling theelection.   While the White House and State Department had no immediatecomment, Terry Kneebone, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Panama Citysaid, ``It makes it worse.''   ``Noriega has closed out his options,'' he added.   Earlier Wednesday, supporters of Noriega, Panama's de factoleader since 1983, beat opposition presidential candidate GuillermoEndara and his two running mates with iron bars and bats as he ledprotesters alleging electoral fraud.   Soldiers made no attempt to intervene during the attack, inwhich Endara suffered a gash in the head that required eightstitches.   Officials said one of Endara's bodyguards was killed and foursoldiers were wounded in a gunfight. Witnesses said some of thecandidates' bodyguards leaped out of cars and fired at theattackers.   Later Wednesday, Endara was taken from his campaign headquarterson a stretcher after a second attack. The New York Times reportedEndara ``had difficulty walking and his speech was slurred. Hisdoctor said the left side of his body was partly paralyzed.''   Paitilla Hospital early Thursday denied Endara was being treatedthere.   Endara's two vice-presidential candidates, Guillermo Ford andRicardo Arias Calderon, were bloodied but not injured as seriously.News reports said scores of others were injured.   The three candidates were leading a motorcade through thecapital when they were attacked by civilians wearing red ``DignityBattalion'' T-shirts and wielding an assortment of sticks, bats,pipes and rubber whips.   Armed civilian Noriega supporters, often members of paramilitary``Dignity Battalions,'' have frequently taken part in breaking upopposition demonstrations.   ``They beat me in the head with an iron bar,'' said Endara in abrief hospital interview. ``I saw Arias on the ground with me,'' hesaid, referring to his first vice presidential candidate.   Arias Calderon told The Associated Press that Ford had beenarrested and taken to an undetermined location.   The incident took place at a Defense Forces blockade, andopposition bodyguards shot four soldiers, said Defense Forcesspokesman Capt. Eduardo Lim Yueng. He said a second lieutenant wascritically injured.   Davis said one of Endara's bodyguards was killed.   It was the first time soldiers suffered gunshot wounds sinceNoriega came to power in this nation of 2.2 million.   Endara, sitting in a wheelchair, displayed the stitches doctorsput in the top of his head.   ``I blame Noriega for everything bad that has happened in theRepublic of Panama. I hope he leaves soon,'' he said.   Angry crowds broke windows and burned at least six cars in thedowntown area. Police broke up scattered groups of demonstratorswith tear gas and gunshots fired in the air.   The motorcade was part of an opposition campaign to gaininternational support and prevent an official victory proclamationin favor of Noriega's hand-picked candidate, Carlos Duque.   Duque was ahead by a 2-1 ratio in the secretive official countof the estimated 800,000 votes cast Sunday.   More than 300 observers, including Europeans, the U.S.delegation as well as former President Jimmy Carter, called theelection fraudulent and said Endara actually won by a 3-to-1 margin.   The TV announcer repeated government accusations that theopposition is trying to help the United States abrogate the PanamaCanal treaties, under which Panama gains control of the canal onDec. 31, 1999.   The U.S. Southern Command had told its personnel to stay out ofpublic places unless on official business, and then to appear onlyin civilian clothes.   Davis said five members of the U.S. armed forces were detained,three of them reservists who were quickly released. He said heexpected the other two to be released shortly and that they werebeing treated well.   U.S.-Panama relations have been poor since Noriega orchestratedPresident Eric Delvalle's ouster in February 1988, and the CIAreportedly contributed $10 million to the opposition campaign.Delvalle was replaced by the acting president, Manuel Solis Palma.   Delvalle tried to fire the general after he was indicted inFlorida on drug-smuggling and money-laundering charges, but theNoriega-dominated National Assembly removed him from office.Noriega claims the U.S. charges are a smokescreen to keep the canal.</TEXT></DOC>
