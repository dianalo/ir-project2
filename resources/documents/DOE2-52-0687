The organizershad one thing in mind when this workshop was planned. It was wanted tomake a record of mistakes in designing and building the electronic system.The time when this workshop was held was just before the completion ofthe TRISTAN detectors when everyone was very busy. Brilliant achievementshave been published every year in the world, but the hard earned experienceon what should not be done does not appear on publication. To recordit while it is still hot was the basic motivation of this workshop. Morethan 100 people attended the workshop, and some speakers did excellentlywhat the organizers hoped to do, but some talked on their great achievementsonly. The organizers are very thankful to everybody who helped before,during and after the workshop. If possible, it should be asked all speakersto hand in their write-ups on the day of the workshop. Actually, thelast write-up was received almost one year late, and the publicationof this report delayed. In this book, those write-ups are collected.(Kako, I.).</TEXT></DOC>
