He gave one woman an award for translating questions into theliterary code; another got an award for translating equations intothe math code; the third award was for handling the text code forgeography; and the last was for translating computer exercises.   ``None of these ladies could read the other's code, yet an11-year-old is supposed to get all this stuff,'' Duran said. ``Thiswas the final straw!''   Duran and four other blind men from academia and industry havelaunched a battle to unify the system of dots into one consistentlanguage.   ``The current Braille system is one of the blind child's greatesthandicaps,'' according to the first newsletter from Braille Researchand Literacy Inc., Duran's group. ``BRL intends to remove this quiteunnecessary burden by creating a single unified but simple Braillecode.''   Floyd Cargill, chairman of the Braille Authority of NorthAmerica, the standard-setting organization for Braille, says Brailleworks and does not need fixing. The National Federation of the Blindhas not taken a stance one way or the other.   Braille patterns of one to six raised dots in variouscombinations represent the letters A through Z, and 37 othercombinations form common contractions or symbols. The 64th possible``cell'' is a blank space.   The five common Braille codes _ literary, math, computer,geography and music _ share the 26 symbols representing thealphabet, but the other 37 can have entirely different meanings fromcode to code.   A semicolon in the literary code is a 2 in the math code, andsome contradictory symbols are much more confusing. A blind studentmay grow up believing there are different kinds of periods but beunable to distinguish between open or closed parentheses _ asignificant handicap when working with a computer.   ``In print you almost have an infinite variety of squiggles thatyou can use to form letters and numbers and punctuation,'' not tomention type styles, said Abraham Nemeth, the blind designer of theinternationally recognized Nemeth Braille Math Code.   ``Those 64 Braille symbols have got to make do for all thenotations that you have in print,'' Nemeth added.   He said a unified Braille code could encourage some blind peopleto rely less on tape recordings and audio computer programs inbusiness and education.   Tim Cranmer, director of research for the National Associationfor the Blind and a designer of the computer code for Braille,supports unifying the Braille codes by building on the existingmodes.   ``It would be a mistake to invent a new code,'' Cranmer said.``What we want to do is combine the best elements of the existingcodes so there would be very little learning to do.''   But as far as Duran and his associates are concerned, developingthe new code, with the help of a computer programmed for codingtheory, is the easy part. Convincing people of the need to adapt isthe hard part.   When they've accumulated adequate backing, Duran, physicist JohnCovici, computer programmers Richard Gage and Robert LaGrone, andjob placement specialist Don Breda will launch a national effort tosway people toward a better Braille.   Duran noted that many magazines and technical manuals are neverread by the blind because they are too complicated to translate, andsaid a unified code could make it easier to produce more currentreading material.   ``The reality is that there's so few books and it takes so longto produce them that they're out of date,'' said Duran, 46, whosecomputer products company provides computer access to the blind andvisually impaired through audio accessories and large-print screens.   ``We have to convince adults that there's more to read. ... Ifthey're willing to change a litle and to grow, they'll have moreaccess to the world than they ever realized.''</TEXT></DOC>
