SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mankind needs to begin considering how it willcope with a warmer climate in the future, instead of just trying tofigure out ways to head off the ``greenhouse effect'' on theatmosphere, a scientist said Wednesday.   ``One effect (of warming) could be to present us with a futurethat is remarkably different from the present,'' said William E.Riebsame of the University of Colorado.   ``We ought to be thinking, as a society, about how we can adaptto changes,'' Riebsame, director of the Natural Hazards Researchand Applications Center at the school, told a symposium sponsoredby a consortium of Colorado colleges.   ``We all know that climate has changed on this planet in thepast ... and it's likely to change again,'' agreed Thomas H. VonderHaar, who heads Cooperative Institute for Research in theAtmosphere at Colorado State University.   The hot, dry summer of 1988 helped attract considerableattention to the greenhouse phenomenon. Scientists believe theeffect occurs when increasing amounts of carbon dioxide and othergases trap the heat of the sun, warming the planet, although theyare not sure if this summer was an example or was just unusuallyhot.   Response to warnings about climate change have concentrated onlegislation and international agreements seeking to reduce thegases involved, in hopes of preventing the overheating of the Earth.   That is a worthwhile effort, Riebsame said, noting that theeffort could also reduce acid rain and reduce fossil fuel use.``But some climate change is going to occur anyway,'' he said.   ``The bottom line is, it doesn't take much change to put you innew social conditions,'' Riebsame said ``Small changes in means(averages) can bring large changes in extremes.''   Some researchers have estimated that the greenhouse effect couldincrease the planet's average temperature by 2 degrees to 3 degreesCelsius (3.2 to 4.8 degrees Fahrenheit) over the next few decades,Riebsame said.   That may not sound like much, but the seemingly small numbersgive a false sense of security, he said.   For example, the decade of the 1930s, the Dust Bowl years thatparched the nation in the worst heat and drought on record,averaged only 1.2 degrees Celsius above normal, he pointed out.   ``I'm not saying we're going to hell in a hand basket, but weneed an insurance policy,'' said Riebsame.   At the least, he said, ``we ought to be looking at past climatechanges and asking ourselves, what would we do if that happenedtoday to come through with flying colors.''   Pinning our hopes on avoiding the greenhouse warming would be amistake, he said. Instead, research needs to be done on adaptation,new methods of agriculture, forestry, flexible planning for changeand reconsideration of the policy of seeking a maximum sustainedyield from the land.   Warming will change crop growth patterns, water availability andmany other things, Riebsame noted. This year, for example, lowwater disrupted transportation on the Mississippi River.   A variety of potential threats have been reported by scientistslooking into the greenhouse effect, including a northward shift inthe major grain growing areas, drought in many areas and melting ofthe polar ice caps, resulting in a rise in sea levels that couldthreaten coastal communities with inundation.   The planet's average temperature has warmed about one-halfdegree Celsius in the last century, Riebsame noted, a period whenindustrial development sharply increased the carbon dioxide in theatmosphere.</TEXT></DOC>
