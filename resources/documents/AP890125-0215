Robert Keppel, a state attorney general's investigator whotracked Bundy for nearly 15 years, said he believes Bundy may havekilled more than 100 girls and women.   As Keppel spoke at a news conference, the Florida prosecutor whosent Bundy to the electric chair Tuesday estimated he may have slainas many as 50 young women. The FBI said it was still analyzing theconfessions given to a parade of law enforcement officers Bundyinvited to the Florida State Prison beginning late last week.   ``The whole thing was orchestrated from the very beginning,''Keppel said of the confessions, in which he participated. Hedismissed as phony Bundy's final interview putting some of the blamefor his activities on pornography.   ``Pornography is maybe one-one-thousandths of the whole problemhe had,'' Keppel said, adding that the interview with James Dobson,a religious broadcaster and psychologist, ``was totallyself-serving.''   He said the only remorse Bundy felt in his final hours was forhimself.   Bundy, 42, admitted during his final days to killing 23 women,including 11 in Washington state, officials said. He was convictedof killing three others.   Keppel said he believes the toll is much higher, and that theexact numbers and details will never be known.   ``My feeling is he has killed way over 100,'' said Keppel, who asa King County detective investigated the eight ``Ted'' killings inthe Seattle area that occurred in 1974.   Bundy confessed to those crimes, and to killings in Utah,Colorado and Idaho.   Keppel has interviewed Bundy several times in the past few years,and said he would take the information gathered in his latestsessions and present it to other law agencies in hopes it will helpsolve still-unexplained murders.   During the final interviews, Keppel also questioned Bundy aboutthe Green River killings of western Washington and Oregon, primarilyto gain insight into how a serial killer thinks and acts. Bundy wasimprisoned in Florida when the Green River killings began in theearly 1980s.   Keppel played a tape he had recorded during a session with Bundyon Friday, when the former Tacoma resident and law school dropoutadmitted to killing the eight ``Ted'' victims.   In the tape, Bundy describes how he lured a University ofWashington student, Georgann Hawkins, to his car, beat her with acrowbar, and then drove her to a secluded, grassy spot in the hillsnear Issaquah, east of Seattle.   Keppel would not play the part of the tape where Bundy detailedhow he killed and apparently mutilated her and other victims, out ofrespect for the families of the victims.   ``I was shocked,'' he said of the way the victims were treated.He said investigators hadn't known Bundy's methods because thevictims were found weeks and months after their deaths, and manybones had been strewn by animals.   Keppel said Bundy used stalling tactics during the last days,even as he invited law enforcement officers from various states tothe prison to talk about murder cases.   Bundy would ``let 'em squirm, let 'em dangle, for a little moreinformation,'' said Keppel, hopeful that such tactics would win hima last-minute respite from the death penalty, if only temporarily.   However, it was only because death was imminent that Bundy didconfess at all, added Keppel. Had the Florida governor indicated inthe slightest way he would spare Bundy to allow law officers moretime to question him, Bundy would have clammed up, Keppel said.   He also said law enforcement officers would have been welladvised to use a different method in questioning Bundy, with thosewho were successful given more of the task.</TEXT></DOC>
