Ridgely Bullock,the bank's interim chairman, said in a statement Monday. ``We areright on track with our strategic plan.''   Bullock was named interim chairman last week after the boardforced out the previous chairman, Walter Connolly.   Bank of New England announced earlier this month it was tryingto sell $6 billion worth of assets because it expected to post aloss of more than $1 billion in 1989 because of bad real estateloans.   The bank said it expected to make a profit of about $176 millionfrom selling the credit card business. Analysts said the ability toraise more than $800 million in cash was more important.   ``This relieves some of the funding pressure on them,'' saidGerard Cassidy, a banking analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc. ``Itgives them a little more breathing room.''   The bank last week had to borrow money from the Federal ReserveBank of Boston as small and large depositors withdrew millions ofdollars.   Bank and federal officials have not confirmed the amountborrowed, but it was believed to be around $450 million.   The sale of the credit card business must be approved by bankingregulators. Tom Lavelle, a bank spokesman, said approval normallywould take about a month, but both Bank of New England and Citicorpare trying to get the deal cleared ``in short order.''</TEXT></DOC>
