Not guilty on both counts:   When then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III, at Reagan's request,questioned North about the diversion of arms profits to the Contrason Nov. 23, 1986, North is accused of telling Meese the NSC was notinvolved, that the Israelis determined the amount that went to theContras and that rebel leader Adolfo Calero had been ordered toopen Swiss bank accounts to receive arms profit money from Israel.   Meese testified North told him those untruths, but underquestioning by the defense he agreed he was conducting only an``administrative inquiry'' and North was under no legal compulsionto answer. The judge's instructions to the jurors said that toconvict North, they would have to find that he had been ``correctlyinformed of the true nature of the proceeding'' and that hisspecific intent was to obstruct the inquiry.   North denied making untrue statements, saying he readilyadmitted to the attorney general and his aides the diversion ofIran arms proceeds to the Contras.   The only written records of the attorney general's meeting withNorth are 29 pages of what North described as ``very crypticnotes'' taken by one of Meese's aides.</TEXT><TEXT>   Count 9, destroying, altering or removing documents from theNSC. Guilty:   North said McFarlane told him to alter five ``problem memos''North wrote in 1985, to wipe out references of North's secretassistance to the Contras and McFarlane's knowledge of it. Northsaid he believed Reagan wanted the documents changed ``becauseeverything I had done that was described in the documents ... I hadbeen told was at the direction of the president of the UnitedStates.''   McFarlane contradicted North's testimony, saying it was Northwho suggested altering the memos in 1985 when Congress firstinquired about North's Contra activities. North directed hissecretary, Fawn Hall, to make the alterations in November 1986 asthe Iran-Contra affair was about to be disclosed.   Miss Hall said she shredded the originals without instructionfrom North, testifying that ``it seemed the logical thing to do.''   To convict on that count, the jury was told, ``the defendantmust have known his conduct was unlawful.'' Asked at the trialwhether he knew that, North replied ``No, they were his(McFarlane's) documents. It never occurred to me that that would beunlawful.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Count 10, illegally accepting a $13,800 home security systemfrom Iran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord, who North had hiredto run arms to the Contras. Guilty:   North admitted he never paid for the system, but said he nevergot a bill for it. He said he didn't know Secord had footed thebill, although it was a meeting with Secord and former CIA employeeGlenn Robinette that led to the installation. After he was firedfrom the NSC, North admitted he tried to conceal the fact he hadn'tpaid for the system by sending two backdated letters to Robinette.   North said he had gotten the system installed after beingtargeted for assassination by terrorist Abu Nidal and just beforeNorth was scheduled to go to Iran in an attempt to win release ofU.S. hostages held in Lebanon. North said he tried to get thegovernment to protect his home but was turned down because hewasn't high-ranking enough.</TEXT><TEXT>   Count 11, converting traveler's checks to his own use. Notguilty:   Contra leader Calero testified he gave $90,000 in traveler'schecks to North, partly to help in securing release of Americanhostages in Lebanon and partly for the Contra aid effort. Northkept the money in his office safe. The government charged Northspent $4,300 of it on personal expenses. Calero testified he didn'tdemand an accounting because ``I would trust him with my life.''North denied spending the money on himself, saying he used it toreimburse himself for out-of-pocket expenses connected with his job.   The jury was told that to convict North, it would have to findhe used the checks ``in a manner not authorized in advance by theowner'' and ``for purposes other than the purpose under which thetraveler's checks came into his possession as a governmentemployee.''   In an attempt to bolster its charge, the prosecution brought outthat North had paid $8,000 in cash in October 1985 for a family carand that until mid-1985 he had complained repeatedly to an NSCemployee about not having enough money to buy lunch and gasoline toget home. North denied dipping into the office-safe fund forpersonal expenses, saying he bought the car out of a $15,000 cashfund he kept in a metal box bolted to his closet floor at home.</TEXT><TEXT>   Count 12, the only conspiracy count against North, charged hetook part in a scheme with fund-raisers Richard Miller, Dan Conradand Carl Channell to defraud the Treasury of the United States bydrumming up funds for the Contras' military effort under the coverof a tax-exempt organization, the National Endowment for thePreservation of Liberty. Not guilty:   North insisted McFarlane authorized him to brief potentialcontributors with the stricture ``that I would not say to a singleperson, `Would you give me money?' I never did that.'' While hesometimes would explain how much weapons would cost, he could notrecall ``a single donor ever giving money in my presence or ...ever asked to give me money in my presence, not one.''</TEXT></DOC>
