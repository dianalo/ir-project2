This revision is necessary to implement the Debt CollectionAct of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), the Federal guidelines for Agency debt collectionissued by the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office (4CFR 101 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and the guidelines of the Office of Personnel Management(5 CFR 550 <T3>et seq.</T3>) on offsets against employee salaries.This regulation will enhance EPA's ability to collect its debts and reducedelinquencies by providing guidance to its officers and employees on theprocedures authorized by the Debt Collection Act of 1982.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>October 24, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Ray E. Spears, EPA Claims Officer,at (202) 382-4548.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On August 25, 1987, the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) requested public comment on its proposed claimscollection standards. We received comments from one commenter. The commenterquestioned whether EPA continues to have ``common law authority'' to assessinterest on delinquent debts owned by State and local governments. We reviewedthe Government's position on the issue of the continued validity of commonlaw authority for interest assessments. We have concluded that continuedassessment of interest on State and local governments is consistent withthe United States' position that the Debt Collection Act did not abrogatethe assessment of interest on outstanding debts authorized outside of thatstatute.The commenter also raised several questions concerning the relationshipof the claims collection standards to EPA's procedures for grant resolutionsunder 40 CFR Part 30. The claims collection standards control EPA's collection,compromise, suspension, termination, offset and referral of delinquentdebts. The regulation clearly states at andSection; 13.4 that it does notsupersede or require omission or duplication of administrative proceedingsrequired by contract, statute, regulation or other Agency procedures. Assuch, the regulation does not alter the grant requirements of Part 30.Accordingly, we do not find that further clarification of the regulationis needed.Lastly, the commenter suggests that the concept of retroactive applicationprecludes applying the procedures of the regulation to existing grants.As indicated above, the regulation controls EPA's collection and resolutionof its debts, it does not address either the rights or available proceduresof grantees under grant agreements; such rights and procedures are definedby EPA's grant regulations and the grant agreement itself. Accordingly,the issue of retroactive application of the regulation to grantees is notrelevant and changes to the regulation have not been made.The Administrator has determined that this final regulation is not a ``majorrule'' as defined in Executive Order 12291, dated February 17, 1981, becauseit will not result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with Foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Administrator further certifies that this regulation will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,including small business, small organizational units and small governmentaljurisdictions.This regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written comments fromOMB and any EPA response to those comments are in the public docket forthis rule making.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 13</ITAG>Claims, Government employees, Wages.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 15, 1988.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.

EPA will not recover interest where the debt is paidwithin 30 days of the date of the notice. EPA will assess an annual rateof interest that is equal to the rate of the current value of funds tothe United States Treasury (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the Treasury tax and loan account rate) as prescribed andpublished by the Secretary of the Treasury in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual Bulletins,unless a different rate is necessary to protect the interest of the Government.EPA will notify the debtor of the basis for its finding that a differentrate is necessary to protect the interest of the Government.(2) The Administrator may extend the 30-day period for payment where hedetermines that such action is in the best interest of the Government.A decision to extend or not to extend the payment period is final and isnot subject to further review.(3) The rate of interest, as initially assessed, remains fixed for theduration of the indebtedness. If a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement,interest may be set at the Treasury rate in effect on the date a new agreementis executed.(4) Interest will not be assessed on interest charges, administrative costsor later payment penalties. However, where a debtor defaults on a previousrepayment agreement and interest, administrative costs and penalties chargeshave been waived under the defaulted agreement, these charges can be reinstatedand added to the debt principal under any new agreement and interest chargedon the entire amount of the debt.(b) <T3>Administrative costs of collecting overdue debts. </T3>The costs ofthe Agency's administrative handling of overdue debts, based on eitheractual or average cost incurred, will be charged on all debts except thoseowed by State and local governments and Indian tribes.

Where EPA determines thatthere is a need to contract for collection services it will_(a) Retain sole authority to resolve any dispute by the debtor of the validityof the debt, to compromise the debt, to suspend or terminate collectionaction, to refer the debt to DOJ for litigation, and to take any otheraction under this part which does not result in full collection of thedebt;(b) Require the contractor to comply with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended,to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m), with applicable Federal andState laws pertaining to debt collection practices (<T3>e.g., </T3>the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692 <T3>et seq.</T3>)), and with applicable regulations of the Internal RevenueService;(c) Require the contractor to account accurately and fully for all amountscollected; and(d) Require the contractor to provide to EPA, upon request, all data andreports contained in its files relating to its collection actions on adebt.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 13.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Use of credit reporting agencies.</ITAG>EPA reports delinquent debts to appropriate credit reporting agencies.(a) EPA provides the following information to the reporting agencies:(1) A statement that the claim is valid and is overdue;(2) The name, address, taxpayer identification number and any other informationnecessary to establish the identity of the debtor;(3) The amount, status and history of the debt; and(4) The program or pertinent activity under which the debt arose.(b) Before disclosing debt information, EPA will:(1) Take reasonable action to locate the debtor if a current address isnot available; and(2) If a current address is available, notify the debtor by certified mail,return receipt requested, that:(i) The designated EPA official has reviewed the claim and has determinedthat it is valid and overdue;(ii) That within 60 days EPA intends to disclose to a credit reportingagency the information authorized for disclosure by this subsection; and(iii) The debtor can request a complete explanation of the claim, can disputethe information in EPA's records concerning the claim, and can file foran administrative review, waiver or reconsideration of the claim, whereapplicable.(c) Before information is submitted to a credit reporting agency, EPA willprovide a written statement to the reporting agency that all required actionshave been taken. Additionally, EPA will, thereafter, ensure that the creditreporting agency is promptly informed of any substantive change in theconditions or amounts of the debt, and promptly verify or correct informationrelevant to the claim.(d) If a debtor disputes the validity of the debt, the credit reportingagency will refer the matter to the appropriate EPA official. The creditreporting agency will exclude the debt from its reports until EPA certifiesin writing that the debt is valid.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 13.15</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Taxpayer information.</ITAG>(a) The Administrator may obtain a debtor's current mailing address fromthe Internal Revenue Service.(b) Addresses obtained from the Internal Revenue Service will be used bythe Agency, its officers, employees, agents or contractors and other Federalagencies only to collect or dispose of debts, and may be disclosed to creditreporting agencies only for the purpose of their use in preparing a commercialcredit report on the taxpayer for use by EPA.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 13.16</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Liquidation of collateral.</ITAG>Where the Administrator holds a security instrument with a power of saleor has physical possession of collateral, he may liquidate the securityor collateral and apply the proceeds to the overdue debt. EPA will exercisethis right where the debtor fails to pay within a reasonable time afterdemand, unless the cost of disposing of the collateral is disproportionateto its value or special circumstances require judicial foreclosure. However,collection from other businesses, including liquidation of security orcollateral, is not a prerequisite to requiring payment by a surety or insurancecompany unless expressly required by contract or statute. The Administratorwill give the debtor reasonable notice of the sale and an accounting ofany surplus proceeds and will comply with any other requirements of lawor contract.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 13.17 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Suspension or revocation of license or eligibility. </ITAG>When collecting statutory penalties, forfeitures, or debts for purposesof enforcement or compelling compliance, the Administrator may suspendor revoke licenses or other privileges for any inexcusable, prolonged orrepeated failure of a debtor to pay a claim. Additionally, the Administratormay suspend or disqualify any contractor, lender, broker, borrower, granteeor other debtor from doing business with EPA or engaging in programs EPAsponsors or funds if a debtor fails to pay its debts to the Governmentwithin a reasonable time. Debtors will be notified before such action istaken and applicable suspension or debarment procedures will be used. TheAdministrator will report the failure of any surety to honor its obligationsto the Treasury Department for action under 6 U.S.C. 11. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 13.18 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Installment payments. </ITAG>(a) Whenever, feasible, and except as otherwise provided by law, debtsowed to the United States, together with interest, penalty and administrativecosts, as required by andSection; 13.11, will be collected in a single payment.However, where the Administrator determines that a debtor is financiallyunable to pay the indebtedness in a single payment or that an alternativepayment mechanism is in the best interest of the United States, the Administratormay approve repayment of the debt in installments. The debtor has the burdenof establishing that it is financially unable to pay the debt in a singlepayment or that an alternative payment mechanism is warranted. If the Administratoragrees to accept payment by installments, the Administrator may requirea debtor to execute a written agreement which specifies all the terms ofthe repayment arrangement and which contains a provision accelerating thedebt in the event of default. The size and frequency of installment paymentswill bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor'sability to pay. The installment payments will be sufficient in size andfrequency to liquidate the debt in not more than 3 years, unless the Administratordetermines that a longer period is required. Installment payments of lessthan $50 per month generally will not be accepted, but may be acceptedwhere the debtor's financial or other circumstances justify. If the debtis unsecured, the Administrator may require the debtor to execute a confess-judgmentnote with a tax carry-forward and a tax carry-back provision. Where theAdministrator secures a confess-judgment note, the Administrator will providethe debtor a written explanation of the consequences of the debtor's signingthe note. (b) If a debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a voluntaryinstallment payment is to be applied among the debts, that designationwill be approved if the Administrator determines that the designation isin the best interest of the United States. If the debtor does not designatehow the payment is to be applied, the Administrator will apply the paymentto the various debts in accordance with the best interest of the UnitedStates, paying special attention to applicable statutes of limitations.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 13.19 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Analysis of costs; automation; prevention of overpayments, delinquenciesor defaults. </ITAG>(a) The Administrator may periodically compare EPA's costs in handlingdebts with the amounts it collects, (b) The Administrator may periodically consider the need, feasibility,and cost effectiveness of automated debt collection operations. (c) The Administrator may establish internal controls to identify the causesof overpayments and delinquencies and may issue procedures to prevent futureoccurrences of the identified problems. <ITAG tagnum="52">SUBPART C_Administrative Offset </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 13.20 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Administrative offset of general debts. </ITAG>This subpart provides for EPA's collection of debts by administrative offsetunder section 5 of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3716), otherstatutory authorities and the common law. It does not apply to offsetsagainst employee salaries covered by andSection;andSection; 13.21, 13.22 and13.23 of this subpart. EPA will collect debts by administrative offsetswhere it determines that such collections are feasible and are not otherwiseprohibited by statute or contract. EPA will decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether collection by administrativeoffset is feasible and that its use furthers and protects the interestof the United States. (a) <T3>Standards.</T3> (1) The Administrator collects debts by administrativeoffset it_ (i) The debt is certain in amount; (ii) Efforts to obtain direct payment from the debtor have been, or wouldmost likely be, unsuccessful or the Administrator and the debtor agreeto the offset; (iii) Offset is not expressly or implicitly prohibited by statute, regulationor contract; (iv) Offset is cost-effective or has significant deterrent value; (v) Offset does not substantially impair or defeat program objectives;and (vi) Offset is best suited to further and protect the Government's interest.(2) The Administrator may, in determining the method and amount of theoffset, consider the financial impact on the debtor. (b) <T3>Interagency offset.</T3> The Administrator may offset a debt owed toanother Federal agency from amounts due or payable by EPA to the debtor,or may request another Federal agency to offset a debt owed to EPA. TheAdministrator may request the Internal Revenue Service to offset an overduedebt from a Federal income tax refund due a debtor where reasonable attemptsto obtain payment have failed. Interagency offsets from employee salarieswill be made in accordance with the procedures contained in andSection;andSection;13.22 and 13.23. (c) <T3>Multiple debts. </T3> Where moneys are available for offset againstmultiple debts of a debtor, it will be applied in accordance with the bestinterest of the Government as determined by the Administrator on a case-by-casebasis. (d) <T3>Statutory bar to offset.</T3> Administrative offset will not be mademore than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt firstaccrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect thedebt were not known and could not have been known through the exerciseof reasonable care by the officer responsible for discovering or collectingthe debt. For purposes of offset, the right to collect a debt accrues whenthe appropriate EPA official determines that a debt exists (e.g., contractingofficer, grant award official, etc.), when it is affirmed by an administrativeappeal or a court having jurisdiction, or when a debtor defaults on a paymentagreement, whichever is latest. An offset occurs when money payable tothe debtor is first withheld or when EPA requests offset from money heldby another agency. (e) <T3>Pre-offset notice.</T3> Before initiating offset, the Administratorsends the debtor written notice of: (1) The basis for and the amount of the debt as well as the Agency's intentionto collect the debt by offset if payment or satisfactory response has notbeen received within 30 days of the notice; (2) The debtor's right to submit an alternative repayment schedule, toinspect and copy agency records pertaining to the debt, to request reviewof the determination of indebtedness or to apply for waiver under any availablestatute or regulation; and (3) Applicable interest, penalty charges and administrative costs. (f) <T3>Alternative repayment.</T3> The Administrator may, at the Administrator'sdiscretion, enter into a repayment agreement with the debtor in lieu ofoffset. In deciding whether to accept payment of the debt by an alternativerepayment agreement, the Administrator may consider such factors as theamount of the debt, the length of the proposed repayment period, whetherthe debtor is willing to sign a confess-judgment note, past Agency dealingswith the debtor, documentation submitted by the debtor indicating thatan offset will cause undue financial hardship, and the debtor's financialability to adhere to the terms of a repayment agreement. The Administratormay require financial documentation from the debtor before consideringthe repayment arrangement. (g) <T3>Review of administrative determination.</T3> (1) A debt will not beoffset while a debtor is seeking either formal or informal review of thevalidity of the debt under this section or under another statute, regulationor contract. However, interest, penalty and administrative costs will continueto accrue during this period, unless otherwise waived by the Administrator.The Administrator may initiate offset as soon as practical after completionof review or after a debtor waives the opportunity to request review. (2) The Administrator may administratively offset a debt prior to the completionof a formal or informal review where the determines that: (i) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice EPA's abilityto collect the debt; and (ii) The time before the first offset is to be made does not reasonablypermit the completion of the review procedures. (Offsets taken prior tocompletion of the review process will be followed promptly by the completionof the process. Amounts recovered by offset but later found not to be owedwill be refunded promptly.) (3) The debtor must provide a written request for review of the decisionto offset the debt no later than 15 days after the date of the notice ofthe offset unless a different time is specifically prescribed. The debtor'srequest must state the basis for the request for review. (4) The Administrator may grant an extension of time for filing a requestfor review if the debtor shows good cause for the late filing. A debtorwho fails timely to file or to request an extension waives the right toreview. (5) The Administrator will issue, no later than 60 days after the filingof the request, a written final decision based on the evidence, recordand applicable law. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 13.21 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Employee salary offset_general. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Purpose.</T3> This section establishes EPA's policies and proceduresfor recovery of debts owed to the United States by installment collectionfrom the current pay account of an employee.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each employeefrom whom the Agency proposes to collect a debt by salary offset underthis section is entitled to receive a written notice as described in paragraph(c) of this section. (3) Each employee owing a debt to the United States which will be collectedby salary offset is entitled to request a hearing on the debt. This requestmust be filed as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. The Agencywill make appropriate hearing arrangements which are consistent with lawand regulations. Where a hearing is held, the employee is entitled to awritten decision on the following issues:(i) The determination of the Agency concerning the existence or amountof the debt; and(ii) The repayment schedule, if it was not established by written agreementbetween the employee and the Agency.(b) <T3>Exceptions to entitlement to notice, hearing, written response andfinal decision. </T3>The procedural requirements of paragraph (a) of thissection are not applicable to any adjustment of pay arising out of an employee'selection of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program(such as health insurance) requiring periodic deductions from pay, if theamount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less. However,if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over more than four pay periodsthe full procedures prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section willbe extended to the employee.(c) <T3>Notification before deductions begin. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph(b) of this section, deductions will not be made unless the employee isfirst provided with a minimum of 30 calendar days written notice. Noticewill be sent by certified mail (return receipt requested), and must includethe following:(1) The Agency's determination that a debt is owed, including the origin,nature, and amount of the debt;(2) The Agency's intention to collect the debt by means of deductions fromthe employee's current disposable pay account;(3) The amount, frequency, proposed beginning date and duration of theintended deductions. (The proposed beginning date for salary offset cannotbe earlier than 30 days after the date of notice, unless this would compromisethe Government's ultimate ability to resolve the debt);(4) An explanation of the requirements concerning interest, penalty andadministrative costs;(5) The employee's right to inspect and copy all records relating to thedebt or to request and receive a copy of such records;(6) If not previously provided, the employee's right to enter into a writtenagreement for a repayment schedule differing from that proposed by theAgency where the terms of the proposed repayment schedule are acceptableto the Agency. (Such an agreement must be in writing and signed by boththe employee and the appropriate EPA official and will be included in theemployee's personnel file and documented in the EPA payroll system);(7) The right to a hearing conducted by a hearing official not under thecontrol of the Administrator, if a request is filed;(8) The method and time for requesting a hearing;(9) That the filing of a request for hearing within 15 days of receiptof the original notification will stay the assessment of interest, penaltyand administrative costs and the commencement of collection proceedings;(10) That a final decision on the hearing (if requested) will be issuedat the earliest practical date, but no later than 60 days after the filingof the request, unless the employee requests and the hearing official grantsa delay in the proceedings;(11) That knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations or evidencemay subject the employee to_(i) Disciplinary procedures under 5 U.S.C.

The request must state the bases upon which the employee disputesthe proposed collection of the debt. The request must be signed by theemployee and be received by EPA within 15 days of the employee's receiptof the notification of proposed deductions. The employee should submitin writing all facts, evidence and witnesses which support his/her positionto the Director, Financial Management Division, within 15 days of the dateof the request for a hearing. The Director, Financial Management Division,will arrange for the services of a hearing official not under the controlof the Administrator and will provide the hearing official with all documentsrelating to the claim.(e) <T3>Requests for hearing made after time expires. </T3>Late requests fora hearing may be accepted if the employee can show that the delay in filingthe request for a hearing was due to circumstances beyond the employee'scontrol.(f) <T3>Form of hearing, written response and final decision. </T3>(1) Normally,a hearing will consist of the hearing official making a decision basedupon a review of the claims file and any materials submitted by the debtor.However, in instances where the hearing official determines that the validityof the debt turns on an issue of veracity or credibility which cannot beresolved through review of documentary evidence, the hearing official athis discretion may afford the debtor an opportunity for an oral hearing.Such oral hearings will consist of an informal conference before a hearingofficial in which the employee and the Agency will be given the opportunityto present evidence, witnesses and argument. If desired, the employee maybe represented by an individual of his/her choice. The Agency shall maintaina summary record of oral hearings provided under these procedures.(2) Written decisions provided after a request for hearing will, at a minimum,state the facts evidencing the nature and origin of the alleged debt; andthe hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions.(3) The decision of the hearing official is final and binding on the parties.(g) <T3>Request for waiver. </T3>In certain instances, an employee may havea statutory right to request a waiver of overpayment of pay or allowances,e.g., 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 5 U.S.C. 5724(i). When an employee requests waiverconsideration under a right authorized by statute, further collection onthe debt will be suspended until a final administrative decision is madeon the waiver request. However, where it appears that the Government'sability to recover the debt may be adversely affected because of the employee'sresignation, termination or other action, suspension of recovery is notrequired. During the period of the suspension, interest, penalty chargesand administrative costs will not be assessed against the debt. The Agencywill not duplicate, for purposes of salary offset, any of the proceduresalready provided the debtor under a request for waiver.(h) <T3>Method and source of collection. </T3>A debt will be collected in alump-sum or by installment deductions at established pay intervals froman employee's current pay account, unless the employee and the Agency agreeto alternative arrangements for payment. The alternative payment schedulemust be in writing, signed by both the employee and the Administrator andwill be documented in the Agency's files.(i) <T3>Limitation on amount of deduction. </T3>The size and frequency of installmentdeductions generally will bear a reasonable relation to the size of thedebt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted forany period may not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which thededuction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deductionof a greater amount. If possible, the installment payments will be in amountssufficient to liquidate the debt in three years or less. Installment paymentsof less than $25 normally will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.(j) <T3>Duration of deduction. </T3>If the employee is financially unable topay a debt in a lump-sum or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent ofdisposable pay, collection will be made in installments. Installment deductionswill be made over the period of active duty or employment except as providedin paragraph (a)(1) of this section.(k) <T3>When deductions may begin. </T3>(1) Deductions to liquidate an employee'sdebt will begin on the date stated in the Agency's notice of intentionto collect from the employee's current pay unless the debt has been repaidor the employee has filed a timely request for hearing on issues for whicha hearing is appropriate.(2) If the employee has filed a timely request for hearing with the Agency,deductions will begin after the hearing official has provided the employeewith a final written decision indicating the amount owed the Government.Following the decision by the hearing official, the employee will be given30 days to repay the amount owed prior to collection through salary offset,unless otherwise provided by the hearing official.(l) <T3>Liquidation from final check. </T3>If the employee retires, resigns,or the period of employment ends before collection of the debt is completed,the remainder of the debt will be offset from subsequent payments of anynature due the employee (e.g., final salary payment, lump-sum leave, etc.).(m) <T3>Recovery from other payments due a separated employee. </T3>If thedebt cannot be liquidated by offset from any final payment due the employeeon the date of separation, EPA will liquidate the debt, where appropriate,by administrative offset from later payments of any kind due the formeremployee (<T3>e.g., </T3>retirement pay). Such administrative offset will be takenin accordance with the procedures set forth in andSection; 13.20.(n) <T3>Employees who transfer to another Federal agency. </T3>If an EPA employeetransfers to another Federal agency prior to repaying a debt owed to EPA,the following action will be taken:(1) The appropriate debt-claim form specified by the Office of PersonnelManagement (OPM) will be completed and certified to the new paying officeby EPA. EPA will certify: That the employee owes a debt; the amount andthe basis for the debt; the date on which payment is due; the date theGovernment's rights to collect the debt first accrued; and that EPA's regulationsimplementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by OPM.(2) The new paying agency will be advised of the amount which has alreadybeen collected, the number of installments and the commencement date forthe first installment, if other than the next officially established payperiod. EPA will also identify to the new paying agency the actions ithas taken and the dates of such actions.(3) EPA will place or will arrange to have placed in the employee's officialpersonnel file the information required by paragraphs (n) (1) and (2) ofthis section.(4) Upon receipt of the official personnel file from EPA, the new payingagency will resume collection from the employee's current pay account andwill notify both the employee and EPA of the resumption.(o) <T3>Interest, penalty and administrative cost. </T3>EPA will assess interestand administrative costs on debts collected under these procedures. Thefollowing guidelines apply to the assessment of these costs on debts collectedby salary offset:(1) A processing and handling charge will be assessed on debts collectedthrough salary offset under this section. Where offset begun prior to theemployee's receipt of the 30-day written notice of the proposed offset,processing and handling costs will only be assessed after the expirationof the 30-day notice period and after the completion of any hearing requestedunder paragraph (d) of this section or waiver consideration under paragraph(g) of this section.(2) Interest will be assessed on all debts not collected within 30 daysof either the date of the notice where the employee has not requested ahearing within the allotted time, completion of a hearing pursuant to paragraph(d) of this section, or completion of waiver consideration under paragraph(g) of this section, whichever is later. Interest will continue to accrueduring the period of the recovery.(3) Deductions by salary offset normally begin prior to the time for assessmentof a penalty. Therefore, a penalty charge will not be assessed unless deductionsoccur more than 120 days from the date of notice to the debtor and penaltyassessments have not been suspended because of waiver consideration byEPA.(p) <T3>Non-waiver of right by payment.</T3> An employee's payment under protestof all or any portion of a debt does not waive any rights which the employeemay have under either these procedures or any other provision of law.(q) <T3>Refunds.</T3> EPA will promptly refund to the employee amounts paidor deducted pursuant to this section, the recovery of which is subsequentlywaived or otherwise found not owing to the United States. Refunds do notbear interest unless specifically authorized by law.(r) <T3>Time limit for commencing recovery by salary setoff.</T3> EPA willnot initiate salary offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after theGovernment's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts materialto the right to collect the debt were not known and could not have beenknown through the exercise of reasonable care by the Government officialresponsible for discovering and collecting such debts.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 13.23</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Salary offset when EPA is not the creditor agency.</ITAG>The requirements below apply when EPA has been requested to collect a debtowed by an EPA employee to another Federal agency.(a)<T3> Format for the request for recovery.</T3> (1) The creditor agencymust complete fully the appropriate claim form specified by OPM.(2) The creditor agency must certify to EPA on the debt claim form: Thefact that the employee owes a debt; the date that the debt first accrued;and that the creditor agency's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 havebeen approved by OPM and send it to the Director, Financial ManagementDivision (PM-226F), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M StreetSW., Washington, DC 20460.(3) If the collection is to be made in installments, the creditor agencymust also advise EPA of the number of installments to be collected, theamount of each installment, and the commencement date of the first installment,if a date other than the next established pay period.(4) Unless the employee has consented in writing to the salary deductionsor signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required proceduresand this information is attached to the claim form, the creditor agencymust indicate the actions it took under its procedures for salary offsetand the dates of such actions.(b) <T3>Processing of the claim by EPA_</T3>(1) <T3>Incomplete claims.</T3> If EPA receives an improperly completed claimform, the claim form and all accompanying material will be returned tothe requesting (creditor) agency with notice that OPM procedures must befollowed and a properly completed claim form must be received before anysalary offset can be taken. The notice should identify specifically whatis needed from the requesting agency for the claim to be processed.(2)<T3> Complete claims.</T3> If the claim procedures in paragraph (a) ofthis section have been properly completed, deduction will begin on thenext established pay period. EPA will not review the merits of the creditoragency's determinations with respect to the amount or validity of the debtas stated in the debt claim form. EPA will not assess a handling or anyother related charge to cover the cost of its processing the claim.(c) <T3>Employees separating from EPA before a debt to another agency is collected_</T3>(1)<T3>Employees separating from Government service.</T3> If an employee beginsseparation action before EPA collects the total debt due the creditor agency,the following actions will be taken:(i) To the extent possible, the balance owed the creditor agency will beliquidated from subsequent payments of any nature due the employee fromEPA in accordance with andSection; 13.22(1);(ii) If the total amount of the debt cannot be recovered, EPA will certifyto the creditor agency and the employee the total amount of EPA's collection;and(iii) If EPA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from theCivil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar payments,it will forward a copy of the claim form to the agency responsible formaking such payments as notice that a debt is outstanding. EPA will alsosend a copy of the claim form to the creditor agency so that it can filea certified claim against the payments.(2) <T3>Employees who transfer to another Federal agency.</T3> If an EPA employeetransfers to another Federal agency before EPA collects the total amountdue the creditor agency, the following actions will be taken:(i) EPA will certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt;and(ii) The employee's official personnel folder will be sent to the new payingagency. (It is the responsibility of the creditor agency to ensure thatthe collection is resumed by the new paying agency.)<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart D_Compromise of Debts</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 13.24</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General.</ITAG>EPA may compromise claims for money or property where the claim, exclusiveof interest, penalty and administrative costs, does not exceed $20,000.Where the claim exceeds $20,000, the authority to accept the compromiserests solely with DOJ. The Administrator may reject an offer of compromisein any amount. Where the claim exceeds $20,000 and EPA recommends acceptanceof a compromise offer, it will refer the claim with its recommendationto DOJ for approval. The referral will be in the form of the Claims CollectionLitigation Report (CCLR) and will outline the basis for EPA's recommendation.EPA refers compromise offers for claims in excess of $100,000 to the CommercialLitigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC20530, unless otherwise provided by Department of Justice delegations orprocedures. EPA refers offers of compromise for claims of $20,000 to $100,000to the United States Attorney in whose judicial district the debtor canbe found. If the Administrator has a debtor's firm written offer for compromisewhich is substantial in amount but the Administrator is uncertain as towhether the offer should be accepted, he may refer the offer and the supportingdata to DOJ or GAO for action.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 13.25</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Standards for compromise.</ITAG>(a) EPA may compromise a claim pursuant to this section if EPA cannot collectthe full amount because the debtor does not have the financial abilityto pay the full amount of the debt within a reasonable time, or the debtorrefuses to pay the claim in full and the Government does not have the abilityto enforce collection in full within a reasonable time by enforced collectionproceedings. In evaluating the acceptability of the offer, the Administratormay consider, among other factors, the following:(1) <T3>Individual debtors. </T3>(i) Age and health of the debtor;(ii) Present and potential income;(iii) Inheritance prospects;(iv) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferredby the debtor; (v) The availability of assets or income which may be realized by enforcedcollection proceedings; or (vi) The applicable exemptions available to the debtor under State andFederal law in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection.(2) <T3>Municipal and quasi-municipal debtors. </T3>(i) The size of the municipalityor quasi-municipal entity; (ii) The availability of current and future resources sufficient to paythe debt (<T3>e.g., </T3>bonding authority, rate adjustment authority, or taxingauthority); or (iii) The ratio of liabilities (both short and long term) to assets. (3) <T3>Commercial debtors. </T3>(i) Ratio of assets to liabilities; (ii) Prospects of future income or losses; or (iii) The availability of assets or income which may be realized by enforcedcollection proceedings. (b) EPA may compromise a claim, or recommend acceptance of a compromiseto DOJ, where there is substantial doubt concerning the Government's abilityto prove its case in court for the full amount of the claim, either becauseof the legal issues involved or a bona fide dispute as to the facts. Theamount accepted in compromise in such cases will fairly reflect the probabilityof prevailing on the legal issues involved, considering fully the availabilityof witnesses and other evidentiary data required to support the Government'sclaim. In determining the litigative risks involved, EPA will give proportionateweight to the likely amount of court costs and attorney fees the Governmentmay incur if it is unsuccessful in litigation. (c) EPA may compromise a claim, or recommend acceptance of a compromiseto DOJ, if the cost of collection does not justify the enforced collectionof the full amount of the debt. The amount accepted in compromise in suchcases may reflect an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigativecosts of collection, taking into consideration the time it will take toeffect collection. Costs of collection may be a substantial factor in thesettlement of small claims, but normally will not carry great weight inthe settlement of large claims. In determining whether the cost of collectionjustifies enforced collection of the full amount, EPA may consider thepositive effect that enforced collection of the claim may have on the collectionof other similar claims. (d) Statutory penalties, forfeitures or debts established as an aid toenforcement and to compel compliance may be compromised where the Administratordetermines that the Agency's enforcement policy, in terms of deterrenceand securing compliance (both present and future), will be adequately servedby accepting the offer. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;13.26 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Payment of compromised claims. </ITAG>The Administrator normally will not approve a debtor's request to pay acompromised claim in installments. However, where the Administrator determinesthat payment of a compromise by installments is necessary to effect collection,a debtor's request to pay in installments may be approved. Normally, whereinstallment repayment is approved, the debtor will be required to executea confess-judgment agreement which accelerates payment of the balance dueupon default. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;13.27 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Joint and several liability. </ITAG>When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, collection actionwill not be withheld against one debtor until the other or others pay theirproportionate share.

Additionally, the Administratormay waive the assessment of interest, penalty charges and administrativecosts during the period of the suspension. Suspension will be for an establishedtime period and generally will be reviewed at least every six months toensure the continued propriety of the suspension. DOJ approval is requiredto suspend debts exceeding $20,000. Unless otherwise provided by DOJ delegationsor procedures, the Administrator refers requests for suspension of debtsof $20,000 to $100,000 to the United States Attorney in whose districtthe debtor resides. Debts exceeding $100,000 are referred to the CommercialLitigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, for approval.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;13.30 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Standards for suspension. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Inability to locate debtor. </T3>The Administrator may suspend collectionon a debt where he determines that the debtor cannot be located presentlybut that there is a reasonable belief that the debtor can be located inthe future. (b) <T3>Financial condition of debtor. </T3>The Administrator may suspend collectionaction on a claim when the debtor owns no substantial equity in real orpersonal property and is unable to make payment on the claim or effecta compromise but the debtor's future financial prospects justify retentionof the claim for periodic review, provided that: (1) The applicable statute of limitations will not expire during the periodof the suspension, can be tolled or has started running anew; (2) Future collection can be effected by offset, notwithstanding the 10-yearstatute of limitations for administrative offsets; or (3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the debt and suspension is likelyto enhance the debtor's ability to fully pay the principal amount of thedebt with interest at a later date. (c) <T3>Request for waiver or administrative review</T3>_<T3>mandatory. </T3>The Administrator will suspend collection activitywhere a statute provides for mandatory waiver consideration or administrativereview prior to agency collection of a debt. The Administrator will suspendEPA's collection actions during the period provided for the debtor to requestreview or waiver and during the period of the Agency's evaluation of therequest. (d) <T3>Request for waiver or administrative review</T3>_<T3>permissive. </T3>The Administrator may suspend collection activitieson debts of $20,000 or less during the pendency of a permissive waiveror administrative review where he determines that: (1) There is a reasonable possibility that waiver will be granted and thedebtor may be found not owing the debt (in whole or in part); (2) The Government's interest is protected, if suspension is granted, bythe reasonable assurance that the debt can be recovered if the debtor doesnot prevail; or (3) Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship to the debtor. (e) <T3>Refund barred by statute or regulation. </T3>The Administrator willordinarily suspend collection action during the pendency of his considerationof a waiver request or administrative review where statute and regulationpreclude refund of amounts collected by the Agency should the debtor prevail.The Administrator may decline to suspend collection where he determinesthat the request for waiver or administrative review is frivolous or wasmade primarily to delay collection. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart F_Termination of Debts </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;13.31 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Termination_general. </ITAG>The Administrator may terminate collection actions and write-off debts,including accrued interest, penalty and administrative costs, where thedebt principal does not exceed $20,000.
