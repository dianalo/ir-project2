The truck-trailer and auto-parts maker began layoffs last weekin its engineering department, Fruehauf spokesman David Hladik saidMonday.   About 40 percent of the department's 78 engineers received pinkslips, and others will be transferred, he added.   ``There will be some layoffs in personnel and an earlyretirement program has been implemented,'' Hladik said.   Low profit margins and hot competition have depressed Fruehauf'strailer division, which lost $29 million in 1986 and broke evenlast year.   The company has been struggling since a management-led leveragedbuyout in 1986 left it saddled with debt. Fruehauf has sold anumber of operations and trimmed its long-term debt to $705million, down from $1.6 billion in 1986.   Last week, the company in part blamed that debt forthird-quarter losses of $19.1 million. That compares to a loss of$14.3 million or $1.77 per share in the third quarter of 1987.   The company is discussing a possible merger with farm andindustrial machinery manufacturer Varity Corp. of Toronto.</TEXT></DOC>
