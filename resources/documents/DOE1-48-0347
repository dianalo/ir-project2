<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-0347 </DOCNO><TEXT>Computerized tomography (CT) is a nondestructive testing technique forgenerating quantitative density (linear attenuation coefficient) mapsof a cross section through an object. By using a series of parallel tomographicimages taken at different elevations, a three-dimensional (3-D) map ofthe object can be obtained. To demonstrate the power of tomography, a3-D region of a motorcycle carburetor has been imaged using twenty-fourparallel two-dimensional images. From these data, new images in planesorthogonal to the original planes have been generated, thereby improvingthe user's ability to visualize the position of components within thecarburetor. The data have also been used to demonstrate the relationshipbetween tomography and radiography.</TEXT></DOC>
