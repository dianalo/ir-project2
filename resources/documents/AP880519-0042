Calvin got word that herSouth Bend, Ind., elementary school had been chosen as one of thenation's best, she made good on a promise to her pupils and kissedthe concrete steps to the building.   ``I told you if we won this, I'd kiss the steps you walk on,''said the overjoyed principal of Muessel School as students watchedher fulfill the pledge.   Her jubilation was shared by the principals, pupils, teachersand parents at 286 other schools across the country Wednesday, froma posh private academy in Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich., to a largelyHispanic public school in Chandler, Ariz., to a Chevy Chase, Md.,school for the learning disabled.   All made the U.S. Department of Education's list of exemplaryelementary schools.   Sidney I. DuPont, headmaster ofGrosse Pointe Academy inMichigan, said, ``As an independent school in a pretty sharp place,I'm not really too surprised we got it.''   ``The real question remains, how close are we to No. 1?'' addedDuPont, whose school charges up to $5,700 tuition and whose parentsraised more than $500,000 at the school's spring auction lastweekend.   At Frye Elementary School in Chandler, Ariz., one of 230 publicschools in the winners' circle, more than half the children areHispanic and nearly two-thirds qualify for free or reduced-pricemeals because of their families' low incomes. But 75 percent readat or above grade level, and their math scores are even higher.   The award shows ``that a school doesn't have to have ademographic breakdown that is mostly high socioeconomic to beconsidered an excellent school,'' said Frye principal Ray Polvani.``Too often in this country, a school is evaluated by the color ofthe kids and their ethnicity or the socioeconomics. ... Itshouldn't be that way.''   A power-sharing arrangement with Frye's teachers has helped theschool rack up achievement gains, said Polvani, as has a ``very,very effective'' bilingual education program.   At the Hebrew Academy of Greater Washington in Silver Spring,Md., Rabbi Pinchos Hecht said the award ``means a lot. I can tellyou until tomorrow that we really do a good job. But when somebodyfrom the outside says it, it feels good.''   The selections were made by 100 people from outside government _only a third of them educators _ who reviewed more than 600 schoolsnominated by state school superintendents and the Council forAmerican Private Education.   Every state except Delaware and South Dakota produced at leastone winner. South Dakota did not nominate any school; one Delawareschool failed to make the final cut.   Principals and other school representatives will be invited toWashington in the fall to receive ``flags of excellence.''President Reagan has hosted the ceremony in past years at the WhiteHouse.   The schools were judged by their stated philosophy and goals,organization, leadership, curriculum, instruction, climate,character development and community relations.   The program also gave extra attention this year to schools withspecial math and science programs.   The department honors exemplary elementary schools one year andsecondary schools the next. Junior highs usually compete among thesecondary schools.</TEXT></DOC>
