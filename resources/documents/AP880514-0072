REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   They turn out faithfully to wavebanners and chant slogans for their exiled leader's return, butsupporters of Ferdinand Marcos are dwindling, and some of hisformer champions believe the ousted president is history.   The death May 4 of Marcos' mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos,revived the spirits of his die-hard followers. They havetransformed her wake into an ongoing rally to demand that Marcos,70, be allowed to return from exile in Hawaii for the funeral.   ``Give Us Marcos or Give Us Death,'' read the banners indowntown Manila on Saturday as thousands rallied to demand theousted leader's return.   Nearly 10,000 Marcos supporters turned out Wednesday for a noisyrally and vowed to camp near President Corazon Aquino's residenceuntil she changed her mind and allowed their leader to come home.   But most of the crowd drifted away in the hot summer night, evenbefore the 4 a.m. deadline imposed by the military for them todisperse.   More than two years after a popular uprising drove Marcos frompower, thousands of Filipinos still long for the return of the``Apo,'' or the ``grand old man,'' who dominated Philippinepolitics for two decades.   But most Filipinos don't expect, let alone want, him to returnto power.   Mrs. Aquino refused to let Marcos come home for his mother'sfuneral, citing his continued threat to national security in thewake of several attempts to topple her.   ``Another fact that the loyalists would have to accept is thatMarcos is already part of history and that Mrs. Aquino is presidentof the Philippines, for better or worse, until 1992,'' wrotecolumnist Alvin Capino in the Philippine Daily Globe, which hasbeen critical of her leadership.   Marcos loyalists are loosely organized into several politicalgroups, including the ``I Am a Filipino Movement,'' and the NewSociety Movement.   Those groups routinely muster crowds of several hundred, whoturn out for pro-Marcos rallies at public squares and in front ofthe American embassy.   The crowds are a curious mix of middle-aged men and women, agingmovie queens, former Marcos-era officials and northerners studyingin Manila.   Reliable figures on the number of Marcos supporters areunavailable. His lawyer, Rafael Recto, insists that Marcos stillenjoys broad albeit discreet support.   ``After all, Marcos was elected and proclaimed by the peoplewhile Cory was just put in the chair by two men _ Ramos andEnrile,'' Recto told the newspaper BusinessWorld.   He was referring to the role of Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, a formerdefense minister, and Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, the formermilitary chief, in the February 1986 uprising that toppled Marcos.   But results of congressional elections in May 1987 and ofregional balloting last January show the New Society Movement withlittle support except in Marcos' native north and in scatteredareas of Mindanao island.   Loyalty to Marcos remains strongest in his home province, IlocosNorte, and other areas of northern Luzon where the Ilocano languageis spoken. Ilocanos make up about 10 percent of the 58 millionFilipinos and have a reputation here for clannishness.   ``The trouble with us Ilocanos is we feel prouder of the honorof having a president from among us rather than the benefits itbrings,'' said Rosario Lazo, an Ilocano member of a pro-Aquinoparty, in a recent interview.   Elsewhere, there are numerous signs that most Filipinos nolonger believe Marcos has a role to play in Philippine politics.   A survey of about 2,000 Manila residents, conducted in March andreleased Thursday by the respected Ateneo Social Weather Station,found that the percentage of those who opposed Marcos' returndeclined from 68 percent in October to 39 percent in March. But itappeared the decline was due more to a feeling that Marcos was nolonger a danger than to any new support for him.   Even some military dissidents who have tried to topple thegovernment seem reluctant to link themselves to Marcos.   Right-wing sources say former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''Honasan, leader of the Aug. 28 coup attempt, has refused to joinwith two other renegades _ former Lt. Col. Reynaldo Cabauatan andformer Brig. Gen. Jose Marie Zumel _ because of theiridentification with Marcos.   Honasan, who escaped from a prison ship last month, played a keyrole in the February 1986 military revolt that triggered the massuprising against Marcos.   Rep. Ramon Durano Jr., a congressman from Cebu island and son ofMarcos' longtime friend and political ally Ramon Durano Sr., saidrecently that despite personal ties to the Marcos family, politicalreality has forced him to cooperate with the Aquino administration.   ``If I don't cooperate with the administration, my bills won'tget passed and I can't work for my constituents,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
