The group also denounced Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, whoseized Estonia, according to the report in Tuesday's edition ofSoviet Estonia newspaper, seen in Moscow on Friday.   The call for a Soviet federation of republics with the right tomanage their own affairs came at a rally organized by the NationalFront, a group of Communist Party members and other people foundedin April with official backing.   The paper quoted leaders of the rally in the Baltic republic assaying Estonia's 32 delegates to next week's party conference inMoscow should seek approval to turn the region into a sovereignrepublic.   Five of the delegates spoke at the meeting. They said theywanted Estonia to be given the right to fix its own prices, pay andinvestments, and to formulate its own cultural, ecological andother policies.   Tiit Vyakhi, a delegate from an Estonian auto repair shop, toldthe crowd, ``I think it's very important for Estonia and allrepublics to get their sovereignty recognized. It's necessary toconfirm the principle of a united federation composed of sovereignstates with fully equal rights.''   Hundreds of intellectuals in Latvia have made similar demandsfor a form of home rule for the Soviet Union's 15 republics. TheBaltic republics, incorporated into the Soviet Union under a secretprotocol of the 1939 Soviet-Nazi pact, have long been the country'smost economically developed and Westward-looking regions.   Other delegates and speakers at the unprecedented meeting in ameadow outside the Estonian capital of Tallinn demanded immediatecondemnation of Stalinism and, by implication, of the Sovietseizure of the Baltic republics in 1940.   The official news agency Tass reported Friday that Estonia hasset up a commission chaired by republican president Arnold Ruutel``to do justice'' to thousands of victims of Stalinist deportationsin 1941 and 1949.   ``Dear delegates,'' a lathe operator from Tartu told the rally,``you don't have any time to wait for the final, titanic works ofdoctors of science about our history.   ``Within a few days, you must make clear who it was in 1940 whohacked up our science books and children's books with axes and makeclear that we are a people of many centuries of culture.''   The report said speeches at the rally were greeted ``not justwith applause, but with the thunder of ovations.'' Picturespublished with the accounts showed crowds waving banners callingfor an end to privilege and praising the new Estonian Communistparty leader Vaino Vyalyas, named to his post June 16.   Although speakers emphasized nationalist demands, they stressedthey did not want to secede from the Soviet Union, and none wasquoted as challenging the rule of the Communist Party.   Dissatisfaction has been rising in Estonia over the migration ofethnic Russians into the republic where ethnic Estonians are now aminority, and over what is seen as the diminishing role of Estonianlanguage and traditions.   Conference delegate Mare Rossmann, a teacher, was quoted assaying Estonians ``simply want to live freely and happily on ourland.''   ``We want to decide ourselves what happiness is. We think thisis the right of all peoples,'' she said.   The newspaper did not explain why it took four days to publishan account of the meeting, which it said was held June 17, a daybefore Estonia's state-run media published the republic's platformfor next week's national party conference in Moscow.   The account of the rally suggested the militant mood in Estoniahas at least the tacit backing of the republic's Communist Partyand that citizens expect immediate results from the Moscowconference opening on Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
