In the appendix, there is a shortdescription of all the agricultural solar energy research projects fundedby Agriculture Canada's Energy Research and Development in Agricultureand Food (ERDAF) program. The research projects have focussed on livestockbuilding heating, greenhouse heating and crop drying. For the first twoapplications, some of the projects are showing positive results. However,for the crop drying application, results have not yet shown that solarenergy can be a viable alternative. For heat deficient livestock buildings,field trials have shown that preheating ventilation air with solar collector/storageuints built into the south wall is cost effective in new construction.Further research on the storage aspect of this technology is requiredfor retrofit applications. For greenhouse heating, project results haveshown there are several viable techniques for improving the performanceof the greenhouse as a solar collector, such as reducing heat losseswith fixed and moveable insulation and developing dehumidificaton andheat exchanger systems to utilize the solar energy that plants convertto non-useable latent heat in evaportranspiration. 18 refs., 33 figs.,2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
