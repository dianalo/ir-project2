Shintaro Abe, secretary general of the governing LiberalDemocratic Party, acknowledged earlier news reports that RecruitCo. paid his wife, Yoko, about $2,300 monthly as a consulting feefrom February 1986 to August 1988.   ``I put my secretary entirely in charge of my fund-raisingaffairs and neither my wife nor myself knew anything about it,''said Abe in a news conference this morning. ``But I have found sucha deal took place and I admit it was a result of my ignorance.''   Abe refused to give any further details. He said the feestotaling about $60,000 were deposited into a bank account of hissecretary, who has been sick and hospitalized.   Abe, the second most powerful Liberal Democrat after Takeshita,was foreign minister and secretary general of the party when hiswife was paid the money. His disclosure followed statements byTakeshita in Parliament Tuesday that he received about $1 millionfrom Recruit, an information services conglomerate.   Both Abe and Takeshita are among 17 politicians and about 150other influential people known to have bought at discount priceshundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in a subsidiary of Recruit_ transactions that generated substantial profits when the shareprice soared after over-the-counter trading began.   The stock transactions were not considered illegal, but Recruitalso paid hundreds of millions of yen to dozens of influentialpoliticians as political contributions, raising suspicions that itwas seeking favors in return.   So far, 14 people, including two former vice ministers and anex-chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., HisashiShinto, have been arrested on charges of bribery and securities lawviolations in connection with the affair, and three Cabinetministers, including former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, havebeen forced to resign due to their links to the scandal.   Today's disclosure showed Abe continued to receive funds fromRecruit even after the scandal surfaced last summer andcontradicted a declaration by the Liberal Democratic Party earlierthis year that no members of the current Takeshita administrationreceived donations from Recruit after last summer.   Opposition parties, which are stalemating parliamentary debateon the national budget for the fiscal year that began April 1,quickly stepped up their criticism of Takeshita and hisadministration.   ``How can he not know about the deposits?'' said YukihisaYoshida, a official of the Democratic Socialist Party, a majoropposition group. ``It is extremely serious that he was receivingmoney even after the Recruit scandal surfaced.''   Shun Ohide, a official of the Japan Socialist Party, the largestopposition group, said: ``Abe has been reported to be closelylinked to Recruit and I think it (today's revelation) was only partof it. After all these revelations, the Liberal Democratic Partyshould resign.''   Despite media surveys showing his public support rate hasdropped below 10 percent _ to 7.8 percent in a poll by thenationwide television network TV-Asahi _ Takeshita has refusedcalls for his resignation, vowing to carry out political reformsand restore public trust in his administration.</TEXT></DOC>
