For many years he extolled the virtues ofSyrian President Hafez Assad. Immediately after theconviction of Syrian-backed Nizar al-Hindawi, the Palestinianwho tried to plant a bomb on an El Al plane via his innocentIrish fiancee, Mr. Seale vanished from the media. It waspresumably impossible for him to explain away the 45-yearprison term given to Nizar al-Hindawi, the longest sentenceever handed down in the history of the British legal system.He was also no longer able to act as an apologist for theSyrian regime since Britain severed diplomatic relations withthat country.</LP><TEXT>   So far from being &quot;respected,&quot; the author has sufferedfrom a profound lack of credibility in recent years.
