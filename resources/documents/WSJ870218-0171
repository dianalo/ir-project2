The tax act limits deductions for business meals and entertainment to 80% of actual costs, effective with tax years starting in 1987. Regular corporations on fiscal years aren't affected until fiscal 1988 begins; one with a year ending next June 30 may deduct 100% of such costs through that date. Fiscal-year partnerships and S corporations (taxed like partnerships) assumed that they too would benefit from this delay in deduction reductions.    But the IRS won't allow that, it says in Notice 87-23, just issued. The deduction effects pass through to individual partners and S-corporation shareholders whose tax years began Jan. 1, it says, and the new limits must be applied at their level. Thus, new rules will let fiscal-year partnerships and S corporations deduct 100% of the costs only through last Dec. 31; since Jan. 1, 80% has been deductible.    That interpretation needs new supporting legislation, contends J. Leigh Griffith, a Nashville, Tenn., lawyer who has studied the issue.    STATISTICAL SAMPLING becomes a tool in audits of multinational concerns.    The IRS often tries to save resources in audits by projecting tax errors from samples of company data; it does this for travel and entertainment deductions. Now, says Leon Nad of Price Waterhouse, CPAs, the IRS is using sampling in challenging prices that a company charges for items sold to foreign subsidiaries; in such cases, the IRS claims that a parent is avoiding U.S. tax by undercharging its foreign units.    In a Tax Court dispute, Halliburton Co. says the IRS seeks to raise its taxable 1978 and 1979 income by $62.5 million for alleged underbilling; $29.5 million of that is from &quot;adjustment(s) for statistical sample population.&quot; Halliburton denies the claim, but a spokesman won't discuss the case. A company may refute an IRS claim by verifying specific transactions, Nad notes. But he says the pending case shows that the IRS is using sampling more aggressively.    S-CORPORATION CONVERTS may be greeted with a year-ending surprise.    Tax revision spurred thousands of closely held regular corporations to apply in 1986 to be S corporations (taxed like partnerships). Fiscal-year concerns knew they also would have to go on the calendar year, but many expected to be able to change in 1988 after short transition &quot;years&quot; ending next Dec. 31, says Marvin Brockman of Trager, Glass andamp; Co., New York CPAs. That way, a special tax-act rule would let shareholders spread the tax effects of the one-time short year equally over four years.    But a combination of old and new IRS rules has upset those plans by making many convert companies switch to the calendar year in 1987 after short years ended last Dec. 31; thus, their owners miss out on the four-year spread and must pay tax on all the short-year income at higher 1986 rates. Further, Brockman notes, those converts now must prepare reports for the short 1986 year.    In states that don't recognize S corporations, the converts must pay state tax for the short 1986 year.    STATES AND LOCALITIES imposed taxes averaging $1,465 per capita in fiscal 1985, up by $109 from the 1984 level, the Census Bureau says. Alaska's burden of $4,585 was the highest, but came in the only state to show a decline (from $4,704). Averages are found by dividing all tax collections, not just personal, by population.    THE IRS AUDITED 1.1% of returns processed in 1986, down from 1.3% in 1985 (it projects a 1.47% rate in 1987). But it audited 4.68% of people with income topping $100,000, including business income. It audited 2.2% of all corporations, but 78% of those with assets exceeding $250 million.    THE TAX COURT BACKLOG at Dec. 31 jumped 13.5% to 83,340 cases from 73,444 a year earlier; the court disposed of 39,387 cases in 1986, but 48,939 were filed. In fiscal 1986, ended Sept. 30, the court assessed damages against 182 taxpayers for pursuing frivolous or delaying actions.    AN EX-SPOUSE'S DUTY was to ask about the source of a big refund.    Soon after Sue S. Levin of Pensacola, Fla., was divorced from Dr. J. Curtis Williams Jr. in 1978, she was asked to sign a joint return for 1977. Although it covered a business of hers, she signed the return without examining it, for she expected to get half of a claimed $23,274 refund. When Williams kept all the refund, she went to court and recovered half. But then the IRS rejected Williams's claimed loss from a coal-mining shelter and billed the two for $50,815 in tax, plus penalty interest.    Levin asked the Tax Court to absolve her as an innocent spouse from liability; she said that if she had been told about the shelter, she had forgotten. But Judge Korner ruled against her: She didn't prove that she didn't know or have reason to know of the shelter deduction; she had a duty to ask about it and couldn't escape the responsibility of signing a return by &quot;turning a blind eye&quot; to facts disclosed in it.    Further, Levin fought for and got a refund based on the deduction.    BRIEFS: The tax act now lets individual retirement accounts invest in U.S. gold and silver coins, but not those made into jewelry, the IRS notes. . . . What luck! New York state mailed its first 1986 refunds -- 26,363 checks for $4.5 million -- last Friday, the 13th. Last year, the state sent out its first refunds on March 7. </TEXT></DOC>
