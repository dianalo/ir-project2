In accordance with this invention, there is provided a combustioncylinder construction for an oil burner comprising: a flame spreadingmeans, and a second heat-permeable cylinder provided above the firstheat-permeable cylinder to constitute a cylindrical side wall of thecombustion chamber. There is also provided a combustion cylinder constructionfor an oil burner of the heat-radiation type. 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
