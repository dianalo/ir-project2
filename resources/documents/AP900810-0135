The decision by the National Association of Broadcast Employeesand Technicians was made Thursday after NBC rejected the union'sbid to resume negotiations with a federal mediator present, a unionspokesman said.   ``NBC's position is that we've had a number of meetings overseven months and there has been ample opportunity to discuss keyissues,'' said Betty Hudson, an NBC spokeswoman. ``The contract ison the table and we have no intention of modifying it.''   There will be no salary increases when NBC puts the contractinto effect because union members haven't ratified it, she said.``They'll operate under the old wage provisions until we have aratified contract.   NBC's previous contract with NABET expired March 31. Unionmembers have twice rejected NBC contract offers.   When NBC implements its new four-year contract, ``it appearsthat we'll be countering with every legal means at our disposal,''said the union's spokesman, John Krieger.   This means a court challenge of NBC's action, said Krieger,whose union says it has 2,373 members at NBC, 1,300 of themengineers.   Major issues in the dispute include jurisdiction, daily hiresand NBC's proposals to let outside producers rent its facilities tomake new programs without union members employed by NBC.   No walkout is imminent. The union's members, who struck NBC for17 weeks in 1987, have not taken a strike vote, Krieger said.   NABET members work at NBC and NBC-owned facilities here and inBurbank, Calif.; Washington; Cleveland;and Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
