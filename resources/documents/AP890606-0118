These analysts said Fed policy-makers had apparently becomeconvinced the economy had slowed sufficiently to ease inflationarypressures.   The Bush administration, which at times has been openly criticalof the Fed's previous tight-money policies, reacted to the apparentchange by saying the administration had ``utmost confidence'' in thecentral bank.   Starting in March 1988, the Federal Reserve had pushed short-terminterest rates up by 3 percentage points in an effort to fightinflationary pressures by raising the cost of consumer and businessborrowing and thus dampening demand.   But in a sign of an apparent shift, a closely watched barometerof Fed policy, the federal funds rate, declined on both Monday andTuesday.   The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge eachother to make overnight loans. The central bank influences the ratethrough daily decisions on how much money it will make available tothe banking system.   The federal funds rate, which had been averaging between 9.75percent and 9.88 percent, fell to around 9.63 percent on Monday anddropped further to around 9.56 percent on Tuesday.   ``We feel the Federal Reserve is easing and I expect they willallow the federal funds rate to drop even further,'' said ElliottPlatt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette.   He predicted a host of business and consumer loans would beheaded lower in the months ahead as the Fed loosens credit in aneffort to keep the economy out of a recession.   On Monday, major banks announced they were cutting their primelending rate by one-half percentage point to 11 percent, the firstreduction in this benchmark lending rate in more than a year.   Platt said he looked for the prime rate to fall to 9.5 percentover the next three to six months, reflecting in part the Fed'seasier money policy.   Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, refusedto comment specifically on whether the Fed had begun drivinginterest rates lower, but he expressed confidence in the decisionsof Fed policy-makers.   ``We in the administration have a great deal of confidence in theFederal Reserve's ability to make sure that we don't let theinflation genie out of the bottle on the one hand while making surethat we do not overdo monetary tightening and throw the economy intoa recession,'' he said during an appearance before the NationalPress Club.   Earlier this year, Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady hadopenly criticized the central bank for being overly concerned aboutinflation while disregarding the threat that high interest ratescould topple the country into a recession.   Boskin said Tuesday that it made sense for the central bank toerr on the side of fighting inflation in January and February wheninflationary pressures were higher.   But he said current signals showed that the jumps in consumerprices earlier in the year were related to temporary boosts in foodand energy costs and had not become embedded in the economy. He saidalso there were many signs that economic growth was slowing to amore sustainable pace.   ``We have more balance now and we seem to be getting someslowdown,'' Boskin said. ``I have utmost confidence in the FederalReserve.''   Analysts said the May unemployment report released last Fridayprobably provided the final bit of evidence the central bank neededto decide that it could begin loosening its credit grip. Theunemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, but it was accompanied by asluggish increase in the number of jobs the economy created.   Former Fed governor Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the MortgageBankers Association, said he believed the Fed would move cautiouslyin lowering interest rates until it was more certain that inflationwas under control.   ``I think the Fed will be cautious because we are not entirelycertain that our inflation problem is behind us,'' Gramley said.   Gramley predicted that mortgage rates will drop further asinflationary fears ease in financial markets. Fixed-rate mortgagesdropped to a national average of 10.48 percent last week, down fromclose to 11 percent at the beginning of May.</TEXT></DOC>
