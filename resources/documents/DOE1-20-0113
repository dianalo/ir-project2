<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-20-0113 </DOCNO><TEXT>A time-of-flight speed measurement technique utilizing ions formed ina flowing gas by the process of laser-induced breakdown (LIBTOF) is described.Breakdown is produced by focusing a pulsed, high energy laser beam inthe flow. The ions are collected downstream of the breakdown volume witha suitable probe. Flow speeds are deduced from measurements of the ionflightpath distance and flight time. Because the breakdown volume issmall, LIBTOF measurements can be made with a high degree of spatialresolution. This technique is used to measure flow speeds in the far-field,low density portions of a CO/sub 2/ free-jet expansion. Free-jet expansionsare important mediums for low temperature molecular spectroscopy as wellas sources of supersonic flow for molecular beams and other gas dynamicapplications.</TEXT></DOC>
