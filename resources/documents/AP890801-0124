Reflecting an ambivalent attitude toward one of the president'smajor legislative initiatives, the multi-industry Clean Air WorkingGroup objected strongly to Bush's planned alternative fuels programfor motor vehicles, and a ``cap'' on utilities' sulfur dioxideemissions, the major cause of acid rain.   Despite these reservations, the coalition of major petroleum,oil, auto, chemical, utility and other companies said Bush'slegislation remains the best hope for breaking a decade-longstalemate on improving the nation's air pollution law.   ``It is tough to get co-sponsors on a bill we don't support,''coalition administrator William Fay, told a news conference. ``Wedid hold our nose.''   By supporting the Bush legislation, industry is trying to steerlawmakers away from rival bills supported by environmental groups,who argue the Bush proposal is loaded with concessions forindustry. The competing legislation would give industry far fewerchoices than the Bush plan in deciding how to curb air pollution,which Fay said is not as bad as some people think.   ``The air in every city but Los Angeles is healthy 99 percent ofthe time,'' he declared.   Besides giving industry's most comprehensive assessment of theBush legislation so far, Fay accused rival environmental groups ofusing a ``rhetorical slight of hand ... to argue the bill is soft.There's no gift here, for consumers, workers or businesses.''   Describing intensive industry lobbying to line up sponsors forthe Bush legislation, one House staffer said she was visited by aGeneral Motors lobbyist even though her boss has announced supportfor the rival legislation.   According to the staffer, the lobbyist argued that automakers``were being unjustly accused'' of causing the nation's airpollution problems even though vehicle pollution has been largelycontrolled by new technology.   The Bush legislation was introduced in the House with 90Republican and 57 Democratic sponsors, and was to be introduced inthe Senate this week.   The provisions that upset the industry group the most have beencited again and again by administration officials as cornerstonesof the legislation.   The alternative fuels plan would require that in areas withsevere ozone pollution _ at least nine cities _ vehicles withclean-burning fuel must be sold according to the followingschedule: 500,000 in the 1995 model year; 750,000 in the 1996 modelyear; and one million in each of the model years from 1997 through2004. Those figures represent only a percentage of the total numberof vehicles expected to be sold in those cities each year.   The Bush plan also would reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 10million tons by the end of the year 2000, based on 1980 levels. Butthe measure also would ``cap'' emissions at the reduced level, thusrestricting growth of utilities unless they could further reducetheir emissions from existing plants.   Speaking of the alternative fuels plan, Fay said, ``We'resuggesting the mandate should not be there'' because automakers arenot certain the technology is perfected for such a program.   The leading alternative fuel is methanol, currently made fromnatural gas but which also can be manufactured from coal. Theindustry group said methanol would be the most likely alternativefuel if the Bush program went into effect.   Michael Mason, a lobbyist with the American Petroleum Institute,told the news conference that his oil industry trade group believesthe proposal to be ``a big mistake'' because ``there should be alevel playing field in which all fuels should be able to compete.''   Mason said most methanol would have to come from Saudi Arabia,Iran or the Soviet Union, and suggested that oil companies may beable to produce a cleaner-burning gasoline as an alternative.   The cap on sulfur dioxide emissions, Fay said, ``isunnecessarily restrictive, limits economic growth, and makes itdifficult to build new factories and power plants.''</TEXT></DOC>
