During his midyear testimony to Congress, Chairman Greenspan said the Fed &quot;at this juncture might be well advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness rather than of stimulus.&quot; Although he refused to discuss the outlook for interest rates, his comments made it clear that the Fed is prepared to continue nudging rates higher in order to head off the threat of inflation.    The Fed's policy will be aimed at slowing economic growth to an annual rate of 2% to 2.5% over the remainder of the year, compared with the rapid 3.6% pace in the first quarter. Mr. Greenspan said the slower pace is more in line with &quot;the long-run potential of the economy.&quot;    Moreover, the Fed chairman said a &quot;leveling&quot; of both the unemployment rate and the factory operating rate are needed &quot;if more-intense inflationary pressures are to be avoided in the period ahead.&quot; The jobless rate is currently at 5.3% of the work force, and Mr. Greenspan has said in the past that unemployment cannot drop much below the &quot;low five percent&quot; range without causing inflation to accelerate. Many economists believe low unemployment rates cause wages to rise, which in turn contributes to inflation.    Mr. Greenspan said the members of the Reserve Board and the presidents of the district reserve banks projected the economy would grow at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2.75% to 3% this year and 2% to 2.5% next year. They projected the unemployment rate would be in a range of 5.25% to 5.75% this year and would move up to 5.5% to 6% next year.    Despite the chairman's tough anti-inflation talk, however, he gave no indication that the Fed was preparing drastic action. And he suggested the Fed's board of governors remains pleased with the current level of the bellwether discount interest rate. The discount rate, the rate the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions, has remained at 6% since last September.    Some analysts say the Fed cannot easily push short-term interest rates higher without also boosting the discount rate. The federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge on loans to each other and is heavily influenced by Fed policy, has already been pushed to more than 7.5% recently from 6.5% in late March.    But Mr. Greenspan suggested the so-called fed funds rate can be pushed higher without changing the discount rate. &quot;The relationship between the fed funds rate and the discount rate has varied quite considerably over the years,&quot; he said, adding that the Reserve Board feels &quot;to date, the current relationships are satisfactory.&quot;    Reserve Board members are known to be reluctant to raise the discount rate now because it might have a disruptive effect on financial markets and could also cause further increases in the value of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets.    Asked about the dollar's recent rise, Mr. Greenspan said he &quot;hasn't seen any evidence&quot; to suggest it is slowing U.S. export growth. He declined to say where he expected the dollar to go in the coming weeks. But he did say that &quot;exchange rate stability is a desirable goal,&quot; and that declines in the dollar could be &quot;counterproductive.&quot;    The Fed chairman also unveiled new targets for money growth for next year. Once again, the Fed declined to set a target for M1, the narrowest money measure, which includes currency and checking accounts. But for M2, which includes M1 plus most savings accounts, the growth target for next year was lowered to 3%-7% from this year's 4%-8% range. For M3, which includes M2 plus bank certificates of deposit, the growth target was set at 3.5%-7.5%, down from 4%-8%. And for total debt, the monitoring range was lowered to 6.5%-10.5% from 7%-11%.    While acknowledging that the money measures have been an unreliable guide to short-term policy in recent years, Mr. Greenspan said they nevertheless have &quot;an important role, and it is quite possible that their importance will grow in the years ahead.&quot;    On other matters, Mr. Greenspan:   --Acknowledged that Fed tightening now is unlikely to have much effect on the overall economy before the November election. &quot;Most of the effects of monetary policy occur with a lag,&quot; he said.    --Opposed an array of proposed legislation that would require businesses to increase the minimum wage, provide workers with expanded health insurance, and give notice to workers before layoffs -- all of which he said could add to inflation.    --Defended Treasury Secretary James Baker's strategy for dealing with Third World debt, saying it was the best way to ensure that debtor nations adopt policies necessary to deal with their problems.    --Repeated his belief that the federal budget should over time be brought into surplus to increase national savings.    --Obliquely criticized banking-deregulation legislation recently proposed by House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St Germain, saying, &quot;My cursory opinion is it could probably accept some amendments from the Senate.&quot;    --Opposed a plan to use the interest earnings of the Fed to help ailing savings and loan associations.    --Said cuts in the federal government's budget deficit would reduce interest rates and boost the dollar &quot;partly by instilling confidence on the part of international investors in the resolve of the United States to address its economic problems.&quot;    ---        The Federal Reserve's Economic Projections                              CURRENT        FEB. 1988    1988    GNP growth*    (inflation adjusted)      2.75%-3%        2%-2.5%    Inflation rate*    (GNP deflator)            3%-3.75%        3.25%-3.75%    Average unemployment rate    (4th quarter 1988)        5.25%-5.75%     5.75%-6%    1989    GNP growth*               2%-2.5%            ...
