He is abiological-control entrepreneur. The bugs he catches are usedto eat weeds.   Though small, the bug business is prospering all over thecountry because people worry about the safety (and the cost)of pesticides and herbicides. Good weevils, beetles and fliesare especially welcome in Montana, which has so many weeds itneeds 56 weed-control districts. They spend millions ofdollars a year spraying herbicides, on spotted knapweed forexample, which blankets half of Missoula County.   But lately word has spread like tumbleweeds around theseparts that Mr. Poritz is not just a bug salesman but maybe abug rustler. He has been accused here in Big Sky country ofpoaching bugs from U.S. government research sites, thenselling them to ranchers and landowners.   Mr. Poritz, a boyish 32-year-old, says he is innocent.   The bug brouhaha pits BCW, Mr. Poritz's tiny company,against (among others) the state Legislature, which he thinkshad him in mind when it considered (but didn't pass) a billimposing a user fee on those who buy bugs to eat weeds. Healso has been the object of criticism from Department ofAgriculture and university researchers who seek to controlweeds with bugs. Even the FBI is investigating Mr. Poritz andsays so. He suspects his critics called up the law becausesome flying insects he captured may have belonged to afederal research project.   Government researchers such as Norm Rees of theAgriculture Department don't accuse any bug rustlers by name.But since BCW is the only private concern in thebiological-weed-control business in Montana, Mr. Poritzdoesn't think he is being paranoid in looking over hisshoulder.   He also feels people are making a mountain out of ananthill. From April to August and two months every fall, heand his wife, Leona, ride in their 1977 Chevrolet Suburban tothe foothills outside town to collect bugs. The Poritzesround up 11 species of beetles, weevils and flies that attackseveral weeds.   Wearing thick knee and elbow pads, they pick bugs by thehundreds off weeds. Some are so tiny the Poritzes needforceps. Others can be caught with the swoop of a net. Mr.Poritz sees a dollar every time he finds a Canada thistlestem-mining weevil, a bug that looks like a tiny tank with along snout.   He puts his catch into cloth bags, plastic buckets orcoolers, depending on the species and its life cycle. Thebugs are sorted, then shipped within 24 hours in papercartons that allow the creatures to breathe but keep themfrom fleeing. He ships more than 400,000 bugs a year,charging between $4 and $100 per 100 insects. BCW is one ofthe few companies marketing weed-munching bugs. Most of theroughly 60 U.S. bio-control concerns sell insects that eatother insects.   Despite careful handling, accidents do happen. A clientrecently complained that all his bugs had died. &quot;I told himto put the bugs in the refrigerator if they arrived too hot,&quot;Mr. Poritz says, &quot;and, well, this guy put them in hisfreezer.&quot;   Biological control, while appealing to people hostile tochemicals, is no panacea. It can take years for good bugs tokill off weeds and bad bugs -- assuming predators don'tgobble up the good bugs first.   But rangeland owners in Montana readily embraceweed-eating bugs as an alternative to expensive and sometimesineffective herbicides. Weeds, which displace natural grassesand can make livestock sick, cost the state an estimated $48million a year. Spotted knapweed alone has spread over aboutthree million acres. A bumper sticker distributed by theButte-Silver Bow Weed Board pleads: &quot;Spread the word, not theweed. Knock out knapweed.&quot;   Most of the pesky weeds are foreign invaders that came tothe U.S. in grain or hay shipments, or as ornamental plants,or in soil used as ballast in 19th-century clipper ships.Lacking natural enemies in America, they proliferated. Itwasn't till early in this century that researchers realizedthat the weeds' natural enemies, imported, could just aseasily eat weeds here, too. Scientists today bring in insectsfrom around the world for testing.   The Agriculture Department, university researchers andstate agencies occasionally release approved bugs into theenvironment -- and they don't charge a dollar a bug, either.The service is free, albeit slow. It's these government-bredinsects and their progeny that indirectly built Mr. Poritz'sbug business -- and added to his woes.   He joined a USDA research station in 1980 as a biologicaltechnician. Six years later, he says, his bosses let him sellbiocontrol insects after he noticed that tight budgets keptthe agency more focused on research than bug releases infields. His orders grew. In February last year, Mr. Poritzquit to start his own company.   &quot;I welcomed him,&quot; says John &quot;Lars&quot; Baker, weed and pestdistrict supervisor in Fremont County, Wyo. Mr. Baker hasbought $30,000 in insects from Mr. Poritz since last year.   Mr. Poritz's troubles began when he decided to collect theshoot-tip gall midge. Imported from Italy and about half thesize of a mosquito, the midge is one of several insects usedto control leafy spurge, a yellowish-green plant hard to killwith poison because of its pervasive root system. TheAgricultural Research Service released the midge in a numberof fields in 1985, and is still studying the insectpopulation on several of those sites.   In May 1990, Mr. Poritz says a pair of landowners let himgather midges on two eight-acre fields where the bugs &quot;hadexploded in population.&quot; Signs identified the spots as USDAresearch sites, but the Poritzes, knowing it was private landand having the owners' permission, collected scores ofmidges.   &quot;Some people are having trouble understanding the signs,&quot;grumbles Robert M. Nowierski, a Montana State Universityassociate professor who coordinates bio-control projects.   Landowner Donald Laubach says he signed a $12-a-monthlease in May 1990 giving Mr. Poritz approval to use his plot.   Mr. Poritz realized what a hornet's nest he had stirred upwhen a former USDA colleague told him the FBI was askingquestions.   Then last January, at a meeting of the Montana NoxiousWeed Trust Fund Advisory Council, a university researcherstood up to complain that somebody was taking insects fromresearch sites and slowing the government's distribution ofbugs. &quot;Everyone in the room knew who he was talking about,&quot;recalls Dave Pickett, Butte-Silver Bow Weed Board chairman.Mr. Pickett wishes it were possible to distinguish betweengovernment and private-sector insects. But, he asks, &quot;how inthe heck can you brand a bug?&quot;   Mr. Poritz says he has had to combat rumors that he wastrafficking in stolen bugs. Some customers canceled orderswithout saying why. &quot;My reputation as a business is beingharmed,&quot; he says, &quot;and, personally, fighting these actionshas really taken its toll.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
