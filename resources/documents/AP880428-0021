During a one-hour meeting on Wednesday, Reagan held to theadministration's 7-year-old position that more research is neededbefore targets are set for reducing the pollution blamed for acidrain.   Mulroney had used the meeting and a subsequent speech toCongress to renew Canadian pleas that the United States follow hiscountry's lead by setting specific pollution-reduction targets andtimetables.   Canada's program will cut pollution levels there to half the1980 levels by 1994, Mulroney told Congress.   ``But that is only half the solution, because the other half ofour acid rain comes across the border, directly from the UnitedStates, falling upon our forests, killing our lakes, soiling ourcities,'' Mulroney said.   The Reagan administration has rebuffed pleas from Northeasternstates as well as Canada to set targets and timetables, callinginstead for more scientific investigation to establish the mosteffective cleanup methods before spending money on acid rainreduction.   A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthat Mulroney gave Reagan ``some private ideas'' on how they mightnarrow their differences on the issue.   The talks, however, did not alter the administration view thatthere is little possibility an acid rain accord sought by Mulroneywill be reached before Reagan leaves office next January, theofficial said.   Prior to his Washington visit, Mulroney said the U.S. acid-rainemissions drifting into his country are tantamount to ``dumpinggarbage'' on Canada. Using more elegant language in his speech toCongress, he said, in effect, the United States is doing the sameto its own environment.   ``The one thing acid rain does not do is discriminate,'' hesaid. ``It is despoiling your environment as inexorably as ours. Itis damaging your environment from Michigan to Maine, and threatensmarine life on the Eastern Seabord.''   He welcomed additional research into ways to reduce emissionsfrom coal-fired furnaces, but said more action is needed.   ``Canada will continue to press fully its case to rid our commonenvironment of this blight, and we shall perservere until our skiesregain their purity and our rains recover the gentleness that giveslife to our forests and streams. And we hope the U.S. Congress andpeople will respond exactly the same way,'' he said.   ``The cost of reducing acid rain is substantial, but the cost ofinaction is greater still,'' he added.   While the leaders remained apart on the acid rain issue, theyjoined in an appeal to both nations' legislatures to ratify theU.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, designed to abolish tariffs andfurther enrich what is already the world's biggest tradingpartnership.   Mulroney noted that the United States sells more goods in Canadathan it does to Britain, France, West Germany and Italy combined.   ``This is a good, balanced and fair agreement, the mostimportant ever concluded between two trading partners,'' Mulroneysaid.   Reagan and Mulroney also said they do not believe the pact willbe endangered by Reagan's threatened veto of a trade bill beingconsidered in the Senate, the official reporting on their meetingsaid.   Reagan also gave his permission for the Canadian purchase oftightly-held U.S. nuclear submarine technology. The Canadians areconsidering the purchase of 10 or 12 nuclear-powered attacksubmarines from France or Britain. If they choose the British``Trafalgar'' class subs, U.S. permission will be required becausethe submarines use American power plants.   An amendment to current U.S.-Canadian agreements would also berequired and thorough Capitol Hill discussion of the issue islikely.   John Warner of Virginia, senior Republican on the Senate ArmedServices Committee, said ``the president's decision to transferclassified technology must rest on national security interests, notpolitical considerations.''   He said Congress will explore the issue ``extensively.''   Reagan and Mulroney set aside their differences over acid rainand accentuated the positive at a White House state dinnerWednesday evening. Reagan lauded his Canadian counterpart as ``agood neighbor and a firm friend,'' and Mulroney reciprocated bycalling Reagan ``honest and wise.''</TEXT></DOC>
