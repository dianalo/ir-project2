The firm made the settlement last Friday with attorneys for2,850 investors who lost a total of more than $20 million in afailed tax-shelter program audited by Laventhol.   The settlement must be approved by a judge in the U.S. DistrictCourt in Sacramento, Calif., Laventhol General Counsel Barry S.Augenbraun told The Associated Press Monday.   Laventhol, based in Philadelphia, is the nation's ninth-largestaccounting firm.   A jury found in favor of the investors in February, makingLaventhol the first big accounting firm to lose a jury trial underthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Under thefederal law, known as RICO, plaintiffs are automatically eligiblefor triple damages.   Under the racketeering charge, Laventhol was accused ofcomplicity in the tax-shelter scheme. The shelters were offered byDairy World Genetics Partnerships, a series of limitedpartnerships, in 1970, 1980 and 1981.   The settlement of the class-action suit is entirely covered byLaventhol's liability insurance, Augenbraun said.   Some attorneys believe the magnitude of the Laventhol settlementcould have negative implications for the accounting profession.   ``As long as the plaintiffs allege that accountants are incahoots with the company in defrauding investors, any accountingfirm can get caught up in RICO,'' Victor Earle, former generalcounsel of accounting firm Peat Marwick, told the Wall StreetJournal.</TEXT></DOC>
