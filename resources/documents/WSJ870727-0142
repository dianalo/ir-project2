At the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japan's largest, individuals are the biggest users of margin trading, or borrowing to buy stock. Regulated margin trading is conducted through securities companies, with lending and collateral subject to exchange and Finance Ministry controls. The amount of official margin trading is within generally accepted bounds, analysts say.    But a lot of individuals also are buying stock by borrowing from consumer credit companies and banks, sometimes using already leveraged stock as collateral or otherwise overextending themselves, analysts say. This unregulated margin trading doesn't show up in official tallies, and some analysts worry that the general flood of leveraged buying in the stock market may at some point turn into a tide of forced selling.    Some analysts even are reminded of the situation that preceded the Japanese stock market's sharp decline in 1965, when issues of large, heavily capitalized companies fell 44%.    Trading overall by individuals has swelled in the last year, and many of them have entered the market for the first time. The presence of so-called amateur investors in itself concerns analysts.    &quot;Salary-men and housewives are now in on the money boom,&quot; says Nobuyoshi Kobayashi, manager of international investment at Nomura Securities Co., Japan's largest brokerage firm.&quot;You have to worry when you look around on the train and they're reading the stock market daily instead of comic books.&quot;    Meanwhile, on Japan's three major exchanges -- in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoyathe balance outstanding of regulated margin trading is about 25% higher than a year earlier and five times higher than 10 years ago.    At the Tokyo exchange, where one-third of trading by individuals is leveraged, margin trading is at near-record levels -- although with the stock market's growth it has declined as a percentage of overall trading value to less than 20% from about 28% five years ago.    Regulated margin trading was made easier last week when the exchange allowed stocks used as collateral to be rated at 70% of the value, up from 50%.    However, when individuals go outside regulated channels to borrow money for stock purchases, collateral may be shaky. In addition, shares bought with unregulated financing may become collateral for another loan-creating a pyramid of credit that many analysts say threatens the market's stability.    In an economic downturn, analysts say, heavy stock sales by people trying to raise cash to pay off debts could cause the market to plunge. At best, thousands of investors could get burned; at worst, the stock slide could reverberate in markets around the world as Japanese sell foreign holdings to obtain cash.    The Tokyo stock market's recent 5% drop in four days, which many analysts considered a correction rather than the start of a crash, forced some individual margin buyers who put up stock as collateral to raise additional collateral, which often is done by selling some shares.    Many analysts believe that a continuing ready flow of cash from institutions would prevent any market crash stemming from individuals' margin buying. Institutional investors remain by far the biggest players in the Tokyo stock market, accounting for about 70% of trading value.    At the same time, though, vigorous institutional investment has helped stock prices double in the 18 months ended June, firing individuals' interest in stocks. In the year ended March 1986, the value of individuals' trading doubled from a year earlier to 94.3 trillion yen ($624.5 billion), and it continues to grow.    A popular way to take the temperature of the Japanese stock market is to measure the ratio of margin buying outstanding to the total value of listed shares. Regulated margin buying outstanding on the Tokyo Stock Exchange represents about 1% of the total capitalization of the first section, well below the 2% level that analysts say sets off warning bells.    Unofficial margin buying, however, doesn't show up in the exchange's figures. While exact figures aren't available on how much financing from consumer credit companies is used to buy stocks, the amount can be estimated based on a breakdown of lending by Family Shinpan Co., a mid-sized, representative consumer credit company.    In the year ended September 1986, about 70% of the general consumer loans made by Family Shinpan were used to buy stock, estimates Tatsuo Saegusa, a company executive.    Based on figures on total lending by members of the National Credit Company Association, it appears that at least 1.7 trillion yen of financing from consumer credit companies made its way into the stock market through September 1986. An analyst estimates the current balance outstanding may be about half that amount.    Adding the unofficial tally to the Tokyo exchange's official margin-buying balance of about 3.9 trillion yen boosts the ratio of margin buying outstanding to 1.3%.    However, Finance Ministry officials say that outside borrowing to buy stocks is considerably less significant than official margin trading and that controls on margin buying are adequate.    &quot;Market information is out every day, it's well known what's going up or down, so it's really the individual's judgment,&quot; says Mineo Hatakeda of the ministry's securities bureau. &quot;If information flows fairly, that's enough. We can't legislate investment.&quot;    Financing from consumer credit companies, whose business has swelled about 30% a year for the past few years, comes on relatively easy, and therefore risky, terms.    Individuals can borrow as much as 50 million yen. The loans run for years, compared with the six-month limit on settlements of most official margin transactions. Also, when leading stocks are used for collateral, consumer credit companies value them at 85% of their current price.    &quot;Anybody can see from the way the market moves that 85% is too high,&quot; says Simon Smithson, manager of research at the Tokyo office of Kleinwort Benson International Inc. &quot;It's quite common for a given share to lose 15%.&quot;    Banks offer loans of as much as 300 million yen, with stock or land as collateral. Ostensibly the loans are for home purchases, weddings or education; but some analysts estimate that as much as 40% makes its way into stocks.    &quot;If you have collateral, they're happy to lend,&quot; says Masakazu Kobayashi, a stock market expert who runs a school that teaches individuals how to invest.    &quot;They don't ask many questions because they're short of lending opportunities.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
