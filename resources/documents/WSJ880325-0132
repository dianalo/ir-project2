The troubled fitness and health-club concern disclosed details of three separate transactions -- two of them already completed -- that dispose of its principal non-operating assets. The company claimed that the restructuring is, at least in part, necessary because of misdeeds by former LivingWell managers whom it is now suing.    In the first transaction, LivingWell said it sold its Powercise International Inc. computerized exercise equipment subsidiary to a group of investors in exchange for $1.1 million in cash, cancellation of $650,000 in manufacturing, leasing and other obligations and assumption by the investors of $1 million of Powercise liabilities.    LivingWell also gave up its 30% ownership of T.H.E. Fitness Centers Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Fla. In that transaction, LivingWell and its finance unit canceled agreements with T.H.E. Fitness for managing clubs and buying membership contracts. LivingWell also got four clubs in South Florida from T.H.E. Fitness by canceling $600,000 in debt and agreeing to lend about $1.1 million to T.H.E. Fitness.    In a third, pending transaction, LivingWell's largest shareholder, Saudi Arabian businessman, Ahmed Mannai, will convert his 20% stake in LivingWell common shares into shares of LivingWell's finance unit, Paramount Acceptance Corp., then swap that Paramount stake and $1.6 million for LivingWell's interest in HFund Inc. HFund, a private investment concern, controls real-estate holdings in Houston, including the Houstonian, a 300-room hotel and fitness complex.    The fitness concern, places blame for its woes on Paul Randal Watson, former president of LivingWell (South), and other managers. LivingWell sued Mr. Watson and the others, charging that they violated federal racketeering laws and deceptive trade practice statutes in several states in a conspiracy to defraud LivingWell and deliberately weaken its operations.    Celeste Jones, an attorney for Mr. Watson, declined to comment on the litigation.    The fast growing concern stumbled in the third quarter when it disclosed a &quot;high number&quot; of membership contracts that had to be canceled &quot;because of the way they were sold,&quot; Senior Vice President Robert L. Waters said at the time. Attorneys general and consumer protection agencies in several states where LivingWell operates said they had had numerous complaints, some of which resulted in investigations and refunds or settlements. </TEXT></DOC>
