<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-14-1047 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new tracer technique and a measuring system consisting of electrochemicaland nuclear measuring units were developed for the in-situ investigationof corrosion and contamination processes. The adsorption of sulfate ionslabelled with sulfur 35 on the powdered surface of austenitic steel 08X18H10Twas studied. The kinetics of the sorption, the effect of Na/sub 2/CrO/sub4/ and the electrode potential were studied. It can be stated that theCr/sup 3+/ containing species of the oxide layer play an important rolein the selective equilibrium sorption. (V.N.) 20 refs.; 12 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
