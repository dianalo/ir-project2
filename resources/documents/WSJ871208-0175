The decision marks the latest setback for the German auto industry, which has been hurt by the dollar's weakness and the world stock-market crash.    Porsche said last month that it was reducing output of its luxury sports cars because of a sharp drop in U.S. sales following the October crash. Audi has a contract with Porsche to assemble two of the latter company's models.    The models are assembled in Neckarsulm, West Germany, near Stuttgart. Audi officials said that shifts will be shortened for 43 workdays between January and June and that about 1,850 of Audi's 11,500 workers will be affected. </TEXT></DOC>
