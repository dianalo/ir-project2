Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, who was recently elected president of theinterim government, also offered an amnesty for Afghanistan'scommunist government troops if they switch sides in the 10-year-oldcivil war.   Fellow guerrilla fighters based in Iran today reportedly rejectedthe interim government the insurgents hope will take over ifPresident Najib's communist government falls in Kabul.   At a news conference ending a stormy three-week meeting ofPakistan-based guerrillas, Mojaddidi said the guerrilla governmentwould become functional inside Afghanistan within a month, ``Godwilling.''   He asked foreign countries to recognize the proposed governmentand for the United Nations to give it a General Assembly seat.   The religious and political strains among the guerrillas wereevident when their council elected Mojaddidi, considered a moderateamong the Moslem guerrillas, as president and and Rasul Sayyaf, afundamentalist from the Ittehad-e-Islami guerrilla group, aspremier. Fundamentalist factions advocate a strict Moslem system,and moderates have favored a broad-based government in Afghanistanembracing Islam as its official religion.   Afghan Shiite guerrillas, most of whom are in Iran, boycotted the440-delegate council after the Pakistan-based guerrillas, themajority of whom are Sunni Moslem, refused to give them therepresentation they sought.   Tehran radio reported today that leaders of the smallerIran-based resistance rejected the appointment of the interimgovernment, saying they were denied representation to the council.   The radio quoted Mohammad Karim Khalili, spokesman for theIran-based alliance, as saying: ``We consider the formation of theinterim government as one sided, and cannot recognize it.'' Thereport was monitored in Cyprus.   The Shiites, Afghanistan's largest minority, represent only 17percent of Afghanistan's population of 15 million but make up 40percent of the 5 million refugees who have fled to Pakistan and Iran.   Moslem guerrillas have fought the government in Kabul since thecommunists seized power in a violent 1978 coup. Soviet forcesintervened in December 1979.   Moscow withdrew its troops by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediatedaccord.   Guerrilla and Western observers have predicted Kabul will fallwithin months in the absence of Soviet forces, but Najib says hisarmy is strong enough to withstand a guerrilla assault.   A Western diplomatic source, speaking in Islamabad on conditionhe not be further identified, said: ``I think it's too early to talkabout recognition. Their first test will be to get a capital.''   He said the first movement toward the world's acceptance of theguerrilla government might be a ``de-recognition of Kabul.''   Communist forces, heavily armed by the departing Red Army, holdthe capital and Afghanistan's key cities but insurgents, backedmainly by Pakistan and the United States, reportedly control about90 percent of the countryside.</TEXT></DOC>
