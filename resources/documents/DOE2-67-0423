<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-0423 </DOCNO><TEXT>Precise measurements of the Knight shift at Cu(1) (chain) and Cu(2) (plane)sites have been made in the normal state of a YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub7} powder sample, for which the c axis of each grain has been alignedin a magnetic field. By combining these data with the Knight shift datain the superconducting state and the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility,it is shown that: (1) the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility ismainly due to the orbital moment of the 3d electrons, (2) the magnitudeof the spin contribution to the Knight shift is similar at both sites,and (3) the isotropic part of the Cu hyperfine field is large and positive(112 kOe/{mu}/sub B/).</TEXT></DOC>
