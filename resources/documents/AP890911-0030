Upcoming clashes over the clean air bill will pitenvironmentalists against industry, region against region andpowerful lawmakers against their colleagues. But when the fight isover, the nation may have the first major revision in the law since1977.   A House subcommittee Tuesday will be the first panel to tacklethe Bush legislation, which proposes to reduce the main component ofacid rain, sulfur dioxide, by 10 million tons over the next decade,and force severely polluted cities to take pollution-cuttingmeasures that would change residents' lifestyles.   Also, for the first time, the measure would control poisonouschemical substances that can cause cancer and other devastatingdiseases.   Other key issues before Congress this week are the president'sdefense budget, the controversial nomination of Donald P. Gregg asambassador to South Korea, a permanent smoking ban on domesticairline flights and a proposed statute to prohibit flag burning.   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., member of the House Energy and Commerceenvironment subcommittee, said, ``there's going to be a lot ofposturing'' in the panel's hearings this week. Before compromisesare made, ``there are politics that have to be considered as well aspersonal friendships of people who are going to have long careerstogether,'' he said.   Synar is among nine Energy and Commerce Committee members tryingto steer a middle ground between the two main combatants:subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., the champion ofenvironmental organizations; and the chairman of the full committee,John D. Dingell, D-Mich., who usually expresses concerns of theauto, utility and other industries.   Among the issues to be argued before the subcommittee:   _Should the Bush anti-pollution requirements for cars be madetougher over objections of the auto industry? Waxman wants to drop aproposal to average pollution emissions by engine categories. Hewants to double the current manufacturers' warranty onanti-pollution equipment from 50,000 miles to 100,000 miles. And hefavors expanding a Bush proposal for requiring use of alternativemotor fuels.   _Toxic chemicals. Should the legislation cover more substancesthan the Bush legislation, force companies in all cases to installexpensive anti-pollution equipment, direct the chemical industry tobetter prepare for accidental spills, and eliminate economicconsiderations in setting emissions standards?   _Acid rain. Should customers of polluting power plants in ninestates pay a disproportionate share of the cost of cleaning up acidrain emissions? Under the Bush legislation, the brunt of the costwould be paid by electric customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana,West Virginia, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, and Georgia.   On Sunday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator WilliamReilly defended the proposal to require alternate fuels in theworst-polluted cities, saying ``there is no other way'' to curb smog.   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Reilly said alternativefuels such as methanol and ethanol can compete economically withgasoline.   The petroleum industry contends the alternative fuels proposalwould put its members at an unfair disadvantage against the makersof the other fuels. Methanol, for instance, is derived from naturalgas or coal.   Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee is tovote Tuesday on the president's defense package that stressesbig-ticket items such as Star Wars, the B-2 stealth bomber and theMX and Midgetman nuclear missiles.   The full Senate is to vote on the Gregg nomination as ambassadorto South Korea. The one-time aide to then-Vice President Bush hasdenied under oath allegations that he was involved in Oliver North'ssecret operation to resupply the Nicaraguan rebels.   An $11.9 billion transportation spending bill before the Senateincludes language to prohibit cigarette smoking on all domesticairline flights. The current ban on smoking aboard flights lastingtwo hours or less is scheduled to expire in April.   The House has scheduled consideration of a law to banflag-burning in response to the Supreme Court ruling June 21 thatsaid that said such protests are constitutional. The Bushadministration and many lawmakers have pushed for a constitutionalamendment rather than a statute.</TEXT></DOC>
