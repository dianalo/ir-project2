Analysts said production from other sources would sharplydiminish the impact of any cutoff of oil from the Persian Gulfstates, but they said the market still reacted with typicalskittishness at the prospect.   They attributed the market's afternoon weakness to profit-takingand technical factors.   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed at$18.52 per 42-gallon barrel, up 15 cents from Friday's closingprice _ but down 40 cents from its midday high of $18.92 on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange.   Among refined products, May contracts for wholesale unleadedgasoline settled up 0.69 cent at 53.30 cents a gallon, whilewholesale heating oil contracts were up 0.75 cents at 50.50 cents agallon.   In Washington, officials said U.S. Navy vessels destroyed twooffshore Iranian oil platforms, sank a defending Iranian patrolboat and bombed two Iranian navy frigates in retaliation for a mineattack that nearly sank a U.S. vessel last week. Iran attacked oilfacilities off Sharjah and fired on at least two U.S. vessels.   ``There's an overall recognition that if you shut down the gulf,there's not so big an impact'' on world oil supplies, because ofthe number of other producers has grown, said Jayne Ball, ananalyst at the Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. investment firm.   But markets still worry, to the point that ``anything thathappens in that area has got to have an impact on prices,'' sheadded.   Other analysts agreed that the hostilities spurred the earlyjump in prices, attributing the later decline mainly to technicalfactors and profit-taking.   The May crude contract expires at the close Wednesday, and so``a lot of people took advantage of the higher prices and soldoff,'' said Stephen J. McKiernan, president of the McKiernan andamp; Co.commodities trading firm.   Ms. Ball said the failure of the May crude contract to breakabove $19 discouraged traders, who then began the afternoon selloff.</TEXT></DOC>
