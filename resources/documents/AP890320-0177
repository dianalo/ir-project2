Reps. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., and Don Ritter, R-Pa., said in aletter to Commerce Undersecretary Paul Freedenberg they wereconcerned ``about affording the Soviet Union access to advancedtelevision cameras, displays, video recorders and signal processingtechnology'' that could ``result in the transfer to the Soviet Unionof sensitive technology that has potential for both military andcommercial applications.''   The Soviet Union has offered to conduct the first side-by-sidetests of competing HDTV technologies being developed in Japan, theUnited States and Europe. The Soviets say the tests would be anobjective assessment of the differing systems and could speeddevelopment of a single system for worldwide use.   At hearings earlier this month before the House Energy andCommerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, which ischaired by Markey, questions were raised about possible violationsof export-control accords.   HDTV, which promises motion-picture quality images, has a numberof potential uses, including entertainment, medicine, education andthe military.   The Commerce Department has jurisdiction over COCOM, theCoordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control, which is aninternational watchdog agency regulating the flow of high-technologyproducts from Western nations to the communist bloc.   Markey and Ritter asked Freedenberg to report back within 30 dayson whether advanced television technologies are subject to the COCOMrestrictions and if they had been approved for transfer to theSoviet bloc.   Their letter asked Freedenberg to spell out ``what actions theCommerce Department and other federal departments, agencies orentities presently are taking or, prospectively, will take to ensurethat HDTV or advanced television technologies, if they areprohibited technologies, are not transferred to the Soviet Union orother Eastern bloc nations by domestic or foreign entities.''   They also asked Freedenberg to outline how Commerce determineswhat is prohibited by COCOM and how the United States monitorsadherence to the accords by other nations.   Ken Robinson, a policy adviser in the Commerce Department'sNational Telecommunications and Information Administration, saidagency officials could not comment on the letter until they had seenit.   But he noted that Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, during arecent appearance before the subcommittee, ``said he was not infavor of exporting potentially strategic sensitive technology to theEastern bloc.''   Mosbacher also told the subcommittee his department had notagreed to any such transfers, Robinson said.</TEXT></DOC>
