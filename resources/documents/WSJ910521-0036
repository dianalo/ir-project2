To reach these goals, Southern California Edison Co., thenation's second-largest investor-owned utility, and the LosAngeles Department of Water and Power, the largest municipalutility, outlined separate approaches that rely heavily onexisting and proposed energy conservation and efficiencyprograms.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The potential threat {of global warming} is incompletelyunderstood but of a magnitude that it makes sense to takesteps not overly costly today in order to minimize a prospectthat may or may not be confirmed later,&quot; said John E. Bryson,chairman and chief executive officer of Edison and of itsholding company, SCEcorp.   In steps that for the most part recast existing programs,Edison said it will reduce carbon dioxide emissions from itspower plants to about 28.3 million tons by the year 2000 andto 25.9 million tons by 2010. The utility said it emittedabout 31.8 million tons of the gas in 1988, the most recentyear for which reliable figures are available.   DWP said its electric generation facilities produced about17.7 million tons of carbon dioxide in 1989. DWP hopes toeliminate 1.8 million tons of the gas a year by 2000, at anannual cost of about $12 million. By 2010, the utility aimsto eliminate an estimated 3.6 million tons of the gas eachyear.</TEXT></DOC>
