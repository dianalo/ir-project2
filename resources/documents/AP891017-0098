Voting in the world's largest democracy will start Nov. 22 andcontinue Nov. 24, chief election commissioner R.V.S. Perisastritold a news conference. He said subsequent dates would be announcedif two days appear insufficient.   Gandhi's decision came on the heels of fresh charges ofhigh-level corruption and his failure to push two constitutionalamendments through Parliament last week. Gandhi took office fiveyears ago.   ``By deciding to face the people, the government has been forcedto take the only option available to it,'' said Gandhi's chiefpolitical rival, Vishwanath Pratap Singh.   Singh is the leader of the Janata Dal, one of five groupscomprising the opposition National Front.   United News of India and Press Trust of India said Gandhi'sCabinet decided to set November elections rather than wait for theconstitutional deadline of late December or early January.   Gandhi and his Congress Party want to turn the election into areferendum on the constitutional amendments defeated Friday inParliament's upper house, the Press Trust said.   Gandhi said the amendments were designed to give village andmunicipal governments more autonomy.   They fell three votes short of the necessary two-thirdsmajority. Opposition parties charged the bills were intended toconsolidate the federal government's power.   Some analysts said that by pushing power-to-the-people measures,Gandhi hoped to divert attention from charges that he is presidingover a corrupt government.   The 45-year-old prime minister has been dogged for the past twoyears by charges that people close to him or his party receivedkickbacks paid by the Swedish arms company, AB Bofors.   Indian newspapers have alleged that Bofors paid as much as $50million in commissions or kickbacks to secure its 1986 contract tosell $1.4 billion worth of artillery to India.   Gandhi has repeatedly denied he profited from the deal, and hassaid no Indians received commissions. The Indian press has chargedthe money went to companies whose ownerships are largely a mystery.   At stake are 542 seats in the Lok Sabha, or house of the people,Parliament's policy-making lower house.   Gandhi's Congress Party won 415 seats in the last vote, held inDecember 1984 two months after his mother, Prime Minister IndiraGandhi, was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards.   The wave of sympathy that propelled Gandhi to an unprecedentedlandslide subsequently eroded with allegations of corruption.   An August poll published by the respected news magazine IndiaToday projected Gandhi's party would win only 314 seats this time.   An opposition victory would mean an end to the Nehru-Gandhidynasty that has governed the world's largest democracy for all butabout three years since independence from Britain in 1947.</TEXT></DOC>
