(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Andrew OuldandM;Whether you cheered or booed Lotus Development Corp.'s courtroom victory overPaperback Software International, steel yourself for more copyright courtroombattles.andP;  The computer industry faces four to five years of similar casesbefore the courts clarify how much protection software developers areentitled to have under copyright law, experts say.andM;U.S.andP;  District Judge Robert Keeton ruled on June 28 in Boston that the Lotus1-2-3 user interface, including its menu command structure, is entitled tocopyright protection and that Paperback Software's VP-Planner spreadsheetinfringes Lotus copyrights because its copying of the 1-2-3 interface is&quot;overwhelming and pervasive.&quot;andM;Less than a week after winning its case against Paperback Software, Lotusfiled similar copyright infringement suits against Borland International Inc.andO;and The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.andM;Thomas Lemberg, Lotus' vice president and general counsel in Cambridge,Mass., hailed Keeton's ruling as &quot;a landmark opinion,&quot; but law expertspointed out that Keeton's decision is not binding on other judges.andM;Other federal judges &quot;are not at all obligated&quot; to follow the Keetondecision, said Ron Laurie, a copyright attorney with Irell andamp; Manella, a lawfirm in Menlo Park, Calif.andP;  &quot;This is just one trial court,&quot; he said, addingthat &quot;appellate court decisions are more important in determining what thelaw is.&quot;andM;Still, Keeton's 110-page ruling could be significant because it may influenceother judges' thinking &quot;if they think the reasoning is sound,&quot; Laurie said.andM;The main sticking point in copyright law, experts say, is differentiatingbetween an idea and its expression.andP;  &quot;You can copyright the expression butnot the idea.andP;  That's a bedrock principle of copyright,&quot; said Ron Palenski,general counsel for the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations(ADAPSO), a software publishers trade group in Arlington, Va.andM;Making that distinction has always been hard for the courts.andP;  But now theyface the added difficulty of dealing with a new medium of expression --software -- where there are few, if any, precedents, said Paul Goldstein,professor of law at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., and author of athree-volume treatise on copyright.andM;He predicts that &quot;for every Lotus case, there will be other cases&quot; that grantnarrower copyright protection.andP;  &quot;There will be an era of fumbling around,&quot;Goldstein said, as judges interpret the copyright law differently.andM;The most controversial aspect of Keeton's ruling is that he extendedcopyright protection to the 1-2-3 menu command structure, said MichaelJacobs, an attorney with the law firm of Morrison andamp; Foerster in San Franciscoand chairman of an American Bar Association subcommittee on copyrightprotection.andM;By expanding copyright protection beyond screen appearance, Keeton's ruling&quot;may be inconsistent with the basic protection of copyright principles,&quot;Jacobs said.andP;  &quot;The more you depart from appearance issues, the more you getinto the methods of operation, which are unprotectable&quot; under the copyrightlaw.andM;Thus, &quot;it is entirely possible&quot; that other judges across the country willdraw their own interpretations of how much of a software program is entitledto copyright protection, said Laurie of Irell andamp; Manella.andM;It's also likely that as these cases are appealed, the appellate courts indifferent circuits will issue different rulings.andM;&quot;These issues will be dealt with, but it will be over time,&quot; ADAPSO'sPalenski said.andP;  &quot;Unfortunately, the legal system does not provide for quickfixes.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
