The rating service said the downgrade reflects &quot;reduced profit prospects resulting from weak demand and increased competitive pressures for (General Signal's) semiconductor and telecommunications equipment product lines.&quot; The ratings concern affirmed the company's commercial paper rating at single-A-1-plus. In Stamford, Conn., a General Signal spokesman said, &quot;We're not very happy about&quot; Sandamp;P's action. But he said the new rating is still &quot;very high.&quot;    ---   FIRST REPUBLICBANK CORP. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered the credit ratings of the Dallas-based bank holding company and some of its subsidiaries, affecting about $890 million of securities. It cited &quot;unexpectedly large growth in nonperforming assets&quot; in the fourth quarter. The rating concern downgraded First RepublicBank's senior debt to single-B-3 from Ba-3, subordinated debt to Caa from single-B-2, and preferred stock to Ca from single-B-3. Moody's also downgraded the senior debt of First RepublicBank's IFRB Corp. unit to single-B-3 from Ba-3 and its subordinated debt to Caa from single-B-2. A First RepublicBank spokesman said the moves were &quot;a reaction to the continuing perception of weakness in the Texas real estate market.&quot;    ---   UNION TEXAS PETROLEUM HOLDINGS INC. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it upgraded the ratings on about $528 million of the independent oil and gas producer's subordinated debt. The ratings concern cited the Houston-based company's success in reducing its financial leverage and its prospects for modest improvement in net income and cash flow. Moody's also noted that Union Texas had cut its high debt level in half since a 1985 restructuring, without resorting to the sale of core assets. But Moody's said the company's financial leverage, including redeemable preferred stock, remains high. Moody's raised the ratings on Union Texas's senior subordinated debt to Ba-3 from single-B-2 and on its junior subordinated debt to single-B-1 from single-B-3. Moody's also said the company should be able to reduce debt further with cash proceeds generated from its Indonesia liquefied natural gas production and North Sea oil and gas production, &quot;without sacrificing a capital spending program capable of maintaining its reserve position.&quot; A spokesman for Union Texas said &quot;the upgraded ratings for our debt instruments are indicative of Union Texas's strengthened financial position and its improved financial and operating results.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
