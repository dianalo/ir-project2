<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-27-0234 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method is described for collecting light from scintillation countercalorimeters by means of an optical fiber connected to a wave lengthshifter, covering the edge of a scintillation plate. The optical fiberpasses between continuous metallic plates and guides the light to a photomultiplier.The measurements with the calorimeter prototype give the energy resolutionof 8% (FWHM) for 26-GeV electrons and +- 6% uniformity across the calorimetersurface. The method proposed has a number of new advantages. 3 references,3 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
