James Ketelsen, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that Tenneco hasn't had any discussions yet with potential buyers and isn't certain if there will be one buyer for all of the Tenneco Oil Co. unit or if it will be sold in pieces. &quot;It takes more than one bidder to maximize prices,&quot; he said.    The debt-laden conglomerate, with interests as varied as shipyards, shock absorbers, natural-gas pipelines and tractors, won't comment on an expected sales price for its huge oil and gas properties. Investment bankers, securities analysts and industry consultants put the price tag as high as $5 billion to $7 billion. Tenneco has some of the nation's largest oil and natural gas reserves and is the eighth-biggest refiner and marketer.    &quot;The majority of the proceeds will go to debt restructuring,&quot; Mr. Ketelsen said. Tenneco carries a huge $6.4 billion of debt on its books, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio above 65%. Mr. Ketelsen also said the company would consider buying back some of its shares with the proceeds.    For Tenneco, the sale would mark the end of more than four decades of exploring for and producing oil and gas, and would mean the shedding of operations that generated nearly a quarter of the company's 1987 revenue. But even after the sale, Tenneco will continue to operate numerous, unrelated businesses, and the company said it hasn't any plans to make any other large sales soon.    Tenneco amassed much of its mountain of debt by expanding during two of the most severe downturns in its primary businesses, agriculture and energy. In 1985, for example, its slumping farm-equipment unit acquired International Harvester Co.'s farm-equipment business. Tenneco said that only this year is the unit expected to return to profitability.    Wall Street has long been clamoring for Tenneco to restructure, and the company has also been a rumored takeover target at various times in recent years, largely because of its potential breakup value.    Wall Street's reaction to the planned sale was swift and positive, as Tenneco shares surged $4.375 to close at $45.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It was the second most-active issue, with 3.9 million shares changing hands.    Potential acquirers run the gamut, industry officials say, from giant international oil companies to major domestic companies as well as European and Asian interests. Pennzoil Co., Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. were mentioned most frequently because of their recent and sizable cash infusions. Those three companies declined to comment on Tenneco's announcement.    But numerous other large oil companies could finance an acquisition of all or part of Tenneco's properties. As of Jan. 1, Tenneco had proven oil reserves of 407 million barrels and natural gas reserves totaling 2.95 trillion cubic feet. The Tenneco unit had sales of $3.3 billion and operating profit of $233 million last year. The parent had a 1987 loss of $218 million on revenue of $14.79 billion.    Tenneco's oil and gas reserves are valued at about $4.3 billion, according to Tom Tracey, a consultant with John S. Herold Inc. of Greenwich, Conn., an oil industry appraisal and consulting firm. In addition, Herold values Tenneco's so-called prospective acreage -- undrilled properties -- at $390 million. In some recent acquisitions, prospective acreage captured a hefty premium. The firm valued Tenneco's refining, marketing and chemical operations at $480 million.    But Mr. Tracey notes that recent acquisitions of oil and gas in the ground have exceeded Herold's conservative estimates. &quot;It will sell (for) in excess of $5 billion,&quot; said Laura Sloate, a partner in the New York brokerage of Sloate Weisman Murray andamp; Co., who has been critical of the company for not making restructuring moves earlier.    Investment bankers Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and First Boston Corp. will manage the sale, and are expected to offer the properties in packages beginning next month, Tenneco said. The company said it hopes to conclude the sale by the end of the year.    Mr. Ketelsen said it is &quot;likely&quot; that Tenneco would sell its refining and marketing operations to a different buyer than its exploration and production operations. A number of oil-producing countries have expressed interest in getting direct access to U.S. marketing operations.    But the most valuable properties in Tenneco's package are its oil and gas reserves. For instance, industry consultants and analysts said Tenneco's 123 million barrels of oil reserves in Colombia could be of particular interest to Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which both have producing properties there.    Tenneco has 270 million barrels of oil reserves in the U.S. and almost all its gas reserves are domestic. The company could offer separately its Gulf of Mexico properties, its onshore Gulf Coast properties as well as other domestic onshore reserves.    The time is ripe to sell energy properties, Tenneco said, because an expected upturn in natural gas prices will be built into the sales price.    Despite all the rumors, Tenneco said it hasn't received any takeover proposals. The company, however, announced yesterday adoption of an anti-takeover measure. Mr. Ketelsen said Tenneco felt more vulnerable to a hostile attempt while it is going through the sale process than before it was disclosed.    After the acquisition, the new, leaner Tenneco will consist of seven businesses: Case IH; Tenneco Gas Pipeline Group; Tenneco Automotive; Packaging Corp. of America; Newport News Shipbuilding andamp; Dry Dock; Albright andamp; Wilson Ltd, a chemical and phospate maker; and Tenneco Minerals, a producer of soda ash and developer of gold properties.    Tenneco said the pipeline unit will make up 23% of estimated revenues, while its farm and construction unit, the problem-plagued Case IH, will become the dominant unit with a 31% share of estimated revenues. After several depressed years, Mr. Ketelsen said, he expects the nation's second largest farm-equipment manufacturer to reap profits by this quarter from the upturn in the agricultural industry.    ---                 Restructuring Tenneco       1987 Net Sales and Operating Revenue by Business                         Segment            Industrial    78%            Oil andamp; Gas     22%       Estimated Post-Sale Revenue By Business Segment            Farm/Construction  31%            Pipeline           23%            Shipbuilding       14%            Autoparts          13%            Packaging          10%            Chemical            9%</TEXT></DOC>
