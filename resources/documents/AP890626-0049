The tightly controlled media stepped up a propaganda blitzencouraging support for the ruling Communists' decision to relieveparty head Zhao Ziyang of all his party posts for ``supporting theturmoils and splitting the party.''   A senior military official today reiterated previous governmentclaims that there was ``no bloodshed'' on Tiananmen Square whentanks and troops cleared it of pro-democracy demonstrators on June3-4.   ``The whole process was nonviolent. No one used guns,'' said LiZhiyun, one of the commanders of the assault, during a tour of thesquare to foreign reporters.   Li acknowledged some innocent people ``may have been wounded'' astroops battled to reach the square, but said people had been warnednot to go out on the streets that night.Li said he had ``noregrets'' about the street battles to reach the square.   The government said nearly 300 people died in the street battlesin Beijing, about half of them soldiers. Chinese witnesses andWestern intelligence sources said the death toll may have been ashigh as 3,000.   The leadership shake-up, announced Saturday, replaced the69-year-old Zhao with Shanghai party secretary Jiang Zemin, 62, aproponent of economic reforms who supports the current hard linethat dissent must be dealt with harshly.   Zhao is believed to have been stripped of power last month forrefusing to endorse plans by Premier Li Peng and senior leader DengXiaoping to declare martial law in Beijing and have the army clearcentral Tiananmen Square.   The party's Central Committee on Saturday also announced thedismissal from the Standing Committee of the ruling Politburo of HuQili, another moderate said to have opposed the military crackdown,and several Zhao supporters in top party positions.   There were also suggestions the purge would be extended to lowerlevels of the party and government.   The party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, in areport appearing in Chinese dailies today, said party members ``whodeviated from the correct political stand and violated party'sdisciplines during the turmoils and the counterrevolutionaryrebellion should be strictly punished ... including expelling themfrom the party.''   It added that ``those party organizations which had maderesistance against the decisions made by the party's CentralCommittee or had been controlled or manipulated by bad people duringthe turmoils and counterrevolutionary rebellion should be firmlyoverhauled and strictly dealt with.''   ``Turmoils'' alludes to the seven weeks of student-ledpro-democracy demonstrations that were joined by hundreds ofthousands of people including journalists, workers, professionals,party members and government workers.   ``Counterrevolutionary rebellion'' is the government's term forpopular resistance to the introduction of troops in Beijing and forthe nationwide unrest that followed the military assault on thecapital.   The official media, which in the first weeks following theassault reported about 1,800 arrests nationwide and paradedhandcuffed detainees before television screens every night, hasrecently stopped publicizing detentions.   It was not clear whether the government was responding to theinternational statements of protest and outrage over the harshsuppression of dissent, which has included the execution of 27people.   Chinese sources said students, teachers and others who joined thepro-democracy demonstrations were still being picked up by police,although some were being released after questioning.   National television and radio and the official press were filledwith statements from party officials, soldiers, intellectuals,farmers and workers, all solidly backing the party's hard-linestance toward those who failed to stand up against the ``party'senemies.''   The carefully orchestrated propaganda campaign showed a peopledramatically changed from a month ago, when both blue- andwhite-collar workers showed strong support for the students andtheir demands that the party allow greater freedom and endcorruption.</TEXT></DOC>
