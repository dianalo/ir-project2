(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An ominous warming of the atmosphere anddepletion of Earth's protective ozone shield have given urgency toplans by NASA, Japan and Europe to launch four satellites to studythe planet's ecological system.   The project ``will bring about a revolution in our understandingof the Earth as a whole system,'' said Dixon Butler, projectscientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,which plans to spend more than $2 billion on its share.   Instruments planned for the first satellite include a laser tomeasure movement along faults such as the San Andreas inCalifornia; radar that can by peer through clouds and vegetation,and devices to measure wind speed and direction, air temperatureand humidity.   Officials said the polar-orbiting satellites could improveweather forecasts by allowing meteorologists to study developingweather patterns worldwide.   Other instruments also are scheduled to be placed on the spacestation, which is set for operation in the mid-1990s, but the EOSis being designed so it will work even if the space station isdelayed.   The program recently moved into high gear because of ominouschanges in the Earth's atmosphere, Butler said Tuesday, speakingvia satellite to scientists at NASA centers across the country,including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.   The four satellites will operate for 15 years, and one of theirtasks will be to monitor the greenhouse effect, in which Earth'stemperature is gradually rising because of increased carbon dioxidein the atmosphere, Butler said from NASA's Goddard Space FlightCenter in Greenbelt, Md.   The satellites also will keep track of depletion of Earth'sprotective ozone layer, he said.   Scientists fear the greenhouse effect may cause crop failuresand raise sea levels, threating threaten coastal cities. Loss ofhigh-altitude ozone will let more harmful solar ultraviolet raysreach Earth, increasing skin cancer and possibly killingmicroscopic ocean organisms that are at the bottom of the foodchain, scientists say.   NASA plans to launch its first EOS satellite, a 60-foot-longspacecraft carrying 20 instruments, in 1995, followed by the launchof a European Space Agency satellite in 1997. NASA's secondsatellite could lift off in 1997, followed by a 1998 launch for thefourth satellite, which would be Japanese.   Butler said the Soviet Union, which has many satellites in polarorbit, also may participate.   NASA is asking for $20 million in next year's budget todetermine what instruments should be placed on the satellites, thenwill seek money in 1991 to build the equipment, NASA spokesmanCharles Redmond said.   Satellites in polar orbit circle Earth from north to south,allowing onboard instruments to study the whole planet as itrotates.</TEXT></DOC>
