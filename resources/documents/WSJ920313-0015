After his National Party lost a local election to theright-wing Conservative Party last month, Mr. de Klerk calledfor a vote of confidence from the country's five millionwhites. If he loses the March 17 referendum, he has pledgedto resign and call new elections.   If Mr. de Klerk wins, the country is expected to moverapidly towards an interim nonracial government that willhelp make its securities more acceptable to U.S. and othercountries' fund managers, many of whom are prohibited frominvesting in the country. On the other hand, traders predicta negative vote will lead to renewed racial conflict,sanctions and isolation, a brew that will send stocks, bondsand South Africa's currency into a tailspin.   &quot;I feel nervous,&quot; concedes John Taylor, a South Africanspecialist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London. Still, he adds,&quot;this is the best buying opportunity we have seen for almosta year.&quot;   That's largely because within hours of the referendumannouncement late last month, South African stocks and bondstumbled, and the financial rand -- South Africa's investmentcurrency that foreigners must use to buy and sell securitiesin the country -- plummeted. The combination shrank the valueof foreign investors' South African stocks and bonds bynearly 10%.   Also dragging down the &quot;finrand,&quot; as traders call it, havebeen concerns that a future black government will renege onforeign loans. Other drags have included recent divestituresby foreign corporations of South African holdings, plusunfounded fears that the current government will impose newtaxes on interest paid to foreigners. The finrand's discountto the commercial rand, the base currency for domestic andforeign trade transactions, has widened to 25% from 6% lastautumn.   As a result, foreigners can now purchase South Africansecurities at steep discounts to their prices on theJohannesburg Stock Exchange. For example, long-termgovernment bonds are trading to yield about 16.5% for localinvestors, while overseas investors can buy them at yields ofaround 21%.   Meanwhile, South Africa's main international stock -- DeBeers Centenary AG, the Swiss-registered unit of miningbehemoth De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. -- is down 27%since last fall.   While European investors have been big buyers of SouthAfrica government bonds, Americans' appetites are lightbecause of past sanctions. U.S. government sanctions havebeen lifted, but several state and local divestiture programsand prohibitions are still in place.   In the two years since Mr. de Klerk began to dismantleapartheid, foreign investors have &quot;alternated betweeneuphoria, gloom, euphoria and now gloom once again,&quot; saysDana Wakefield, an analyst at stockbrokers Davis Borkum Hareandamp; Co. in Johannesburg.   The finrand's deep discount reflects the currentpessimism. But, according to analysts at Credit LyonnaisLaing in London, the finrand's discount to the commercialrand is probably overdone. They expect it to narrow to 10% to15% from 25% now.   They suggest investors buy blue chip stocks such as miningand investment giants Anglo American Corp. of South Africaand Gencor Ltd., plus De Beers. They also like the SouthAfrica Electricity Commission (Escom) bonds that carry an 11%coupon and mature in 2008 and the 12.5% Republic of SouthAfrica bonds maturing in 1994. For foreign investors, the twobonds currently yield to redemption about 21.5% and 21%,respectively.   Ms. Wakefield of Davis Borkum also expects a sharprecovery in South African securities. Driving this optimismare polls showing Mr. de Klerk will win about 60% of whitevote.   But J. Mark Mobius, president of Templeton EmergingMarkets Fund Inc., thinks South African stocks are tooexpensive. Prices of industrial companies on the domesticmarket are selling at 13.7 times prospective per-shareearnings. Analysts say they have been this expensive onlytwice in the past 30 years.   &quot;The problem of South Africa is that there is too much{local} money chasing too few shares,&quot; says Mr. Mobius. &quot;Thebig institutions can't put money outside the country.&quot; Mr.Mobius is looking for South African shares to fall 30% beforehe starts buying again.   By contrast, John van Eck, chairman and president of VanEck Associates Corp. in New York, thinks the referendumjitters offer &quot;a great opportunity to accumulate gold miningshares. Everybody thinks South Africa is going to go to hell;we don't see that.&quot;   Others aren't so sure. Richard Gray, a director of bondresearch at UBS Phillips andamp; Drew Research Ltd., notes thatinflation is high and economic growth is weak, and thatgovernment spending must rise to meet blacks' aspirations.   Betting on a de Klerk victory &quot;is a perfectly reasonabletrading stance for a speculator but not necessarily aninvestment recommendation,&quot; says Jeremy Archer, a seniorinvestment analyst at Lombard Odier Investment ManagementServices Ltd. in London. &quot;Whatever happens, economic recoveryand political rehabilitation are going to be a long,drawn-out process,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
