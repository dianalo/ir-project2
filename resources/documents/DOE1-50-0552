<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-50-0552 </DOCNO><TEXT>The reaction /sup 3/He(d,p)/sup 4/He has been investigated for E/sub CM/= 5.9-41.6 keV with the use of D projectiles and /sup 3/He atomic gastarget nuclides as well as with /sup 3/He projectiles and D/sub 2/ moleculargas target nuclides. These studies show for the first time the effectsof electron screening on low-energy fusion cross sections, i.e. a nearlyexponential enhancement of the cross sections compared to the case ofbare nuclei. The enhancement is about a factor 2 smaller for the cased(/sup 3/He,p)/sup 4/He due to the molecular nature of the D/sub 2/ targetnuclides.</TEXT></DOC>
