To characterize the atomic structure of defects andgrain boundaries in these materials, a high resolution electron microscopystudy has been initiated. Emphasis has been placed on the technique ofphase contrast imaging with corresponding computer simulation and processingfor optimum interpretation of results.</TEXT></DOC>
