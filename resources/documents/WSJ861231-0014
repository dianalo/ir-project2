The trade dispute has involved Canadian lumber exports to the U.S. totaling about $3 billion a year.    The agreement, reached late last night, calls for Canada to impose a 15% fee on its exports of softwood lumber to the U.S., officials said. This fee would be phased out later when Canadian provincial governments take action to increase so-called stumpage fees for logs cut on government land.    A coalition of U.S. lumber producers filed the trade complaint with the Commerce Department several months ago, charging that imports from Canada have been subsidized by the Canadian government.    In its initial ruling on the case, the Commerce Department determined that the subsidies averaged 15%. A final ruling in this case was required by midnight yesterday.    But the compromise settlement negotiated by the two governments and the withdrawal of the trade complaint means that the case will be terminated and the U.S. won't impose penalty duties on the imports. </TEXT></DOC>
