SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A massive undersea current and earthquakes onthe floor of the Pacific Ocean may be related to the El Nino, aperiodic climate change that can disrupt weather around the world,according to a pair of new studies.   Scientists at the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration reported Thursday that the huge current flowingbeneath the surface of the Pacific may have signaled the end of the1986-87 El Nino.   The American Geophysical Union, meanwhile, published a report,which it acknowledged was controversial, disclosing an apparentrelationship between El Nino and seafloor earthquakes.   The term El Nino refers to a complex series of atmospheric andocean events that occur every two to seven years. It attractedwidespread attention in 1982-83 when the phenomena disruptedweather patterns around the world. It was eventually blamed for1,500 deaths and damage ranging from $2 billion to $8 billion.   That, however, was the strongest El Nino of this century. Mostfit the much milder pattern seen in 1986-87, when some weatherchanges were noted, but little major damage was done.   The disruptions of 1982-83 included a worsening of Africa'sdeadly drought, severe winter storms in California, reduced fishcatch in South America, Australia's worst drought in 200 years,heavy rainfalls i Peru and Ecuador and the first typhoon to hitFrench Polynesia in 75 years _ followed by five more in five months.   Scientists measure the arrival and departure of an El Nino(pronounced el-neen-yo) by changes in ocean surface temperaturesalong the west coast of South America and changes in the airpressure differential between northern Australia and the central oreastern Pacific.   Falling air pressure at Easter Island tends to be a goodindicator of an El Nino, according to an analysis by Daniel A.Walker of the University of Hawaii.   His findings, reported in the American Geophysical Union'sweekly periodical ``Eos,'' found a correlation between that airpressure drop and increases in seafloor earthquakes in the EasterIsland region.   The article was ``published with our recognition that itpresents controversial material. ... Even the possibility oflinkages here should be of interest to both geophysicists andoceanographers,'' wrote Eos oceanography editor Robin D. Muench.   Increased earthquake activity occurred at about the same time asthe El Ninos of 1965, 1976-77 and 1986-87 and just ahead of the ElNinos of 1972-73 and 1982-83, Walker found.   While he doesn't draw any conclusions about cause and effect,Walker points out that the likelihood of these things occurringtogether by chance is one out of 313 cases.   And he notes that the seafloor fractures in the Easter Islandregion which tend to generate the earthquakes vent large amounts ofheat into the ocean.   If this heat were enough to warm the waters above, it could helpgenerate rising air currents, reducing the normal air pressure inthe region. Some scientists have been skeptical about thispossibility, however.   Meanwhile, Michael McPhaden of NOAA's Pacific MarineEnvironmental Laboratory in Seattle, reported on the interruptionof the Equatorial Undercurrent in the Pacific Ocean.   Under normal conditions, westward-blowing winds push the waterat the ocean's surface to the west, and that flow is balanced bywater moving easterly in a current about 175 miles wide about 150to 800 feet beneath the sea surface.   When an El Nino occurs the trade winds weaken, however. Thesurface water flow eases up and thus the balancing deep-sea currentdoes, too, McPhaden found.   That occurred in 1986 and 1987, he reports. Indeed, for a timethe undersea flow of water even was reversed, according to datacollected from moored instruments.   ``Perhaps the origins of El Nino's demise may be found in theweak winds which typify it at its peak,'' McPhaden speculated.   This current moves a volume of as much as 800 million gallons ofwater a second, and climate experts have pointed out that the heatfrom warm ocean water has major impacts on the world's climate.</TEXT></DOC>
