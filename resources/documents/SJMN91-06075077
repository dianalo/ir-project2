When he first started to see &quot;Mona,&quot; she told him that she was notlike other girls. Well, she was right. I've found her hiding in Hugh's bedroomcloset, and she comes to our house in the morning after I've gone to work. Ifhe tries to go to an athletic event without her she harasses him unmercifullyon the phone.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  STOP BEING THE ENEMY TO SON'S GIRLFRIEND  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     I finally called Mona's mother and asked if Mona was on the Pill. I wastold in no uncertain terms that Mona would never have sex before marriage, butI'm sure her mother is mistaken.;    This girl's obsession with my son hascaused me to develop an obsession to rid him of her. It's also causingproblems between my son and me. Of course, this is exactly what the girlwants.;    My common sense tells me to let this puppy-love thing ride itselfout, but I'm afraid if I don't insist that they obey the rules about being inthis house alone, my son's life could be ruined. Any suggestions?;    --Obsessed mother, Oklahoma City;    DEAR O.M. -- Obviously you're convincedyour son and Mona have crossed that line. Since Mona's mother is bat-blind,it's up to you to do what you can to keep these kids out of trouble. Impresson your son the importance of being well-informed and well-equipped. I fearabstinence is unrealistic when the girl is so aggressive and the boy is inhormonal overdrive.;    If you could make a friend of Mona, it would behelpful. After she recovers from the initial shock, she might be open tofriendship and you could then step out of the role of Enemy No. 1 and bereally helpful.;    DEAR ANN -- It looks like somebody lied to you. I readyour column in Stars and Stripes. A letter from a reader said the tobaccocompanies were sending free cigarettes to our troops in the gulf. You printeda statement made by the Army chief of public affairs saying it wasn't true.The Army spokesman denied categorically that the military accepted such giftsfrom the tobacco companies. The very next day I opened a copy of the Novemberissue of Overseas Magazine and on Page 15 is a story about how 10,000 cartonsof Marlboro cigarettes were given free to our troops in Saudi Arabia,delivered Sept. 26.;    I mentioned this to a friend. He said, &quot;I'll betanything those cigarettes were given to the USO by the cigarette company,which then took a tax write-off.&quot; You and I know that if the men and women inthe Persian Gulf get cigarettes free they are going to smoke them. What aswell way to get a few hundred thousand new customers.;    -- Bev Keaveny,Bremerhaven, Germany;    DEAR BEV IN GERMANY -- According to the mail I'vereceived from Saudi Arabia, free cigarettes are all over the place. The Armychief of public affairs was telling the truth, however. Our armed services donot accept free cigarettes, but the USO does. You can be sure I'll be hearingmore about this, and when I do, I'll pass it on.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ann Landers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910315  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  548  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 15, 199100075077,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
