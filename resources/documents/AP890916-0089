Participants at the Paris conference failed to come up with apolitical solution for easing tension among warring factions inCambodia after the Vietnamese leave. Hanoi has said it will pull itstroops out by Sept. 30, ending a 10-year occupation.   The vacuum has created the ``very real possibility that thegenocidal Khmer Rouge could battle its way back to power in PhnomPenh,'' said Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the HouseForeign Affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs.   Fred Brown, an expert on Indochina and former scholar at theCarnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank, said theadministration is in a ``genuine dilemma'' about Cambodia. ``In thewake of the Paris conference, there are serious questions'' aboutU.S. policy, he said.   A major concern are the ties between the Khmer Rouge and PrinceNorodom Sihanouk, the former Cambodian monarch the United Statessupports with millions of dollars in aid. Washington would like tosee Sihanouk head an interim government pending free electionssupervised by the United Nations.   Although members of Sihanouk's family were murdered by the KhmerRouge, which ruled Cambodia between 1975-1979, Sihanouk has endorsedthe idea of including the Khmer Rouge in a transitional governmentin Cambodia.   Both the Khmer Rouge and Sihanouk receive military aid fromChina. Other factions in Cambodia are the Vietnamese-backedgovernment of Hun Sen, and a smaller non-communist faction.   Some observers at the Paris conference said Sihanouk abdicatedtoo much of his authority to the Khmer Rouge. ``Is he every going toloosen himself from the Khmer Rouge?'' Brown asked. ``Nobody cancome up with a leader to replace Sihanouk.''   Vice President Dan Quayle, who is expected to discuss theCambodian situation with Asian allies on a trip to the Far East thisweek, told a group of reporters last week that ``the non-communistresistance has always been, from our viewpoint, the best hope to seea political settlement occur in Cambodia.''   Members of Congress echoed concern about Sihanouk.   ``I think we ought to make clear to Sihanouk that either he andthe non-communists break all their ties to the Khmer Rouge, or theydon't get any help from us,'' said Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass.   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, suggested Pol Pot be brought before aninternational tribunal on charges of genocide. He said the UnitedStates should not go along with Sihanouk's apparent acquiescence onthe Khmer Rouge.   ``The United States does not have the luxury of recusing itself''on moral issues,'' he said.   The Bush administration says its adamantly opposes a return topower of the Khmer Rouge, an extreme nationalist group with about40,000 fighters.   ``We want to ensure that there are not more Cambodian killingfields,'' said Richard Solomon, assistant secretary of state forEast Asian affairs.   At the same time, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher saidthe administration has noted that Sihanouk as well as Washington'sAsian allies have ``said that the Khmer Rouge elements shouldparticipate in the political process.''   Atkins claimed administration officials used ``the most twistedand distorted logic that I've ever seen in foreign policy'' indefending a policy that opposes the Khmer Rouge while seeming to goalong with Sihanouk's idea of including it in the government.   But Solomon said on Capitol Hill last week that it would be``self-delusional'' to ignore the Khmer Rouge, a force to bereckoned with in Cambodia.   And one administration official explained the dilemma. Excludingthe Khmer Rouge means the rebels assuredly would launch a militaryoffensive to seize power, creating a ``little Lebanon in SoutheastAsia,'' he said.   By bringing some Khmer Rouge ``under the tent, there's apossibility that peace will break out,'' he said.   As Solomon put it: ``The chances of avoiding conflict are notvery good,'' but they are better with a political settlement.   Complicating the situation are the Soviets and the Chinese.Solomon said the United States believes Moscow has stepped up armsshipments to the Hun Sen regime in recent months. ``The SovietUnion, as a primary supporter of Vietnam and Hun Sen, must restrictits increasing flow of arms into Cambodia,'' he said.   Brown said Secretary of State James Baker III is likely to broachthe issue in talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadzelater this month. The United States also wants China to end its armssupplies to the Khmer Rouge.   Meantime, the administration has asked Congress _ and receivedapproval _ to spend about $7.5 million in humanitarian aid forCambodia in fiscal 1990, up about $2.5 million from the previousyear.   But sources on Capitol Hill said Bush administration have notrequested any covert assistance for military equipment in theupcoming fiscal year. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
