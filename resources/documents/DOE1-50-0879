They show that this conditional distribution is approximatelyGaussian under certain conditions. In particular, given a single observationfrom a continuous multi-Gaussian process, the conditional distributionunder a small change of support is approximately Gaussian unless, roughlyspeaking, the observed process is twice differentiable and the observationsite is at the center of mass of the support region. A Gaussian approximationfor the conditional prediction error of the total ore in a fixed regionis considered also, although an example demonstrates that a naive analysiscan give incorrect limiting conditional means.</TEXT></DOC>
