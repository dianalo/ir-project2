It is the longest journey of any mammal, from the waters ofnorthern seas off Alaska to the lagoons of Mexico to give birth andthen mate each winter.   Mexican officials say the land and sea ``reserve of thebiosphere'' is necessary to protect the whales and other speciesfrom the effects of development and overzealous tourists, as wellas to provide facilities for scientists to carry out their studies.   They take special glee in noting that the other stops along thewhales' route, Canada and the United States, have yet to take suchstringent measures to protect the once nearly extinct species.   The whales leave the northern waters each October and traveltoward Baja California, swimming four to five miles each day andstaying five to 10 miles off the coast the entire way. Theygenerally reach Mexico in December and remain until March.   Spouts of water vapor glistening in the sun announce the whales'presence at Scammon's Lagoon, whose Spanish name is Ojo de Liebre(Eye of the Hare), almost midway down the long peninsula.   Then the noise of their movement, a powerful swoosh, breaks thesea's stillness. Parts of the 35-ton whales themselves are visibleafter the noise.   The gray whale, unique in its coast-hugging habits, was huntedvirtually to extinction by 1930. Restrictions on commercial whalingsince have helped bring about a comeback, and scientists nowestimate that there are as many as 18,000 gray whales.   The 7.2 million acre reserve takes in much of the peninsula'sBiscayne Desert and extends into the open sea.   Three previous decrees had established refuges for the whales inthe waters of the four major lagoon areas used by the whales, butecologists say it was not enough to consider the marine zone as aseparate entity from the land.   ``We have acted responsibly,'' Urban Development and EcologySecretary Manuel Camacho Solis said in announcing the plans. ``Itis an integral system ... to protect the habitat.''   Scientists and ecological activists caution that the decree,although important, must be followed by serious control andsupervision of the area if it is to prove effective.   ``I think it is a very great effort of Mexico to decree such alarge area a biological reserve, in a country that is economicallyin crisis,'' said the poet Homero Aridjis, leader of the ecologicalactivist Group of 100. ``I couldn't think of anything better. It'smagnificent.''   Aridjis campaigned for the past year calling for greatergovernment protection for the whales.   Although the mid-part of the Baja California peninsula issparsely populated, the major industrial Salt Exporting Co. complexis located close by Scammon's Lagoon, a center of the whales'activity.   The complex, known as ESSA, has joint government and Japaneseprivate ownership. It is the largest open salt mine in the world,exporting some 5 million tons annually.   The maritime traffic has raised concern that diesel fuel spillscould affect the lagoons.   The government plan requires ESSA to present an environmentalprogram.   An Ecology Department study found that construction of piers andcanals and the increase of solid waste in the area as the humanpopulation grew had affected the lagoons that are crucial to thewhales' reproduction.   Mexican communal farms known as ``ejidos'' also are in the area,with agricultural and part-time fishing operations that affect thewhales' habitat.   Tourism, especially boats that travel down the coast fromCalifornia in the area, is noticeable and would be regulated morestrictly under the government's new program.   T-shirts sold in Guerrero Negro, essentially a salt company townwith few tourist attractions, trumpet: ``Visit Baja California.15,000 Whales Can't Be Wrong.''   Tourism within reasonable limits is not regarded asautomatically harmful to the whales, although the noise of theboats disturbs them.   Biologist Luis Fleischer, director of the national researchprogram that has studied the marine mammals each winter for thepast decade, said, ``Well-run tourism can be beneficial, creatingsympathy and interest.''   Anelio Aguayo, a leading researcher on whales at the NationalAutonomous University of Mexico, said some whales now have beenfound that round the tip of Baja California to reproduce on theGulf of California coastline.   He also said he hopes Canada and the United States will followMexico's example and protect other areas along the whale'smigratory corridor, where industrial development often is greater.   ``It's not only up to the government of Mexico to declare zonesof refuge and areas of protection for the gray whale,'' he said inan interview in Mexico City.</TEXT></DOC>
