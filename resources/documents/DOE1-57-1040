The geological resourcesof oil in foreign (excluding socialist) countries are estimated at approximately1.2 trillion tons. Of this quantity, about 473 billion tons are technicallyextractable (not allowing for costs). At the beginning of 1984, the current(residual) extractable resources were about 415 billion tons, of which35% applied to resources of exploitable deposits, including 20% in provenreserves. Of the total amount of current extractable reserves of oil,about 36% constituted resources which may be exploited with costs ofup to $45 per ton (US), including 22% with costs of less than $10 perton. The gas potential of foreign countries (except socialist) has beenestimated at 565 trillion m{sup 3}. Of this, about 350 trillion m{sup3} are technically extractable (without consideration of cost). At thebeginning of 1984, the current gas resources were 318 trillion m{sup3}, of which 17% were confined to exploitable deposits. More than halfof the gas resources which may be exploited at costs not greater than$10/1000 m{sup 3} (US), have already been discovered. Again, 47 trillionm{sup 3} may be exploited at costs of $10-45/1000 m{sup 3} and 19 trillionm{sup 3} at $45-80/1000 m{sup 3}, that is, a total of 112 trillion m{sup3}, of which about 48% are concentrated in already-discovered deposits.About 206 trillion fall in the category of very expensive gas. Theseare as yet mainly undiscovered resources in remote, polar, and deepwaterregions. 4 references.</TEXT></DOC>
