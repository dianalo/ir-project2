Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said the flames in the leftengine were caused by a compressor stall, a problem that can occurwhen the even flow of air to the engine turbine blades isinterrupted, causing too much jet fuel to accumulate.   A DC-10 has three engines, but can safely land on two, said RichTornquist, Federal Aviation Administration regional duty officer.   Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen said Flight 84 arrived in LosAngeles from Honolulu. Mechanics examined the engine and repairedthe problem, he said.   The Minneapolis-bound passengers went to a nearby hotel to restafter the landing at 2:20 a.m. and then boarded a later flight,Gibbons said.</TEXT></DOC>
