In London, prices were down slightly at the close, as a weak early trend in New York erased the market's earlier gains. In Frankfurt, prices also ended mixed as uncertainty over the near-term prospects for the dollar prompted some traders to pull back or take profits from Monday's gains.    Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which gained 13.19 points Monday, lost 60.11 points to close at 23,672.21. Declining issues outpaced advancers narrowly by 493 to 392, while 159 issues were unchanged. Dealers said that almost all sectors were mixed in directionless trading.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index fell 9.99 points to 1,915.84, on light volume of 500 million shares, against 630 million shares Monday.    The second section index, however, rose 29.27 points, to 2,674.84, on heavy volume of 40 million shares, up from 33 million shares.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, share prices were mostly lower. The Nikkei index fell 80.66 points to 23591.55 at the end of the morning session.    Dealers said the smaller-issue second section has been outperforming the first section in recent weeks, reflecting uncertainty over the market's direction.    The better performance of the second section &quot;reflects confidence in the economy, rather than confidence in the market,&quot; said one trader. He said the added uncertainty over the effect of the U.S. quarterly refunding on the dollar and interest rates prompted many investors yesterday to concentrate on smaller issues with good economic fundamentals.    One trader noted that after the Nikkei index and the second section both hit post-crash lows on Nov. 11 last year, the Nikkei index had risen about 12.5% as of the end of trading Monday, but the second section index has risen 18.5%.    Another trader said that although no sectors turned in stellar performances yesterday, auto makers, heavy industrials, pulp and paper shares, and retailers posted modest gains.    Auto makers were led by Hino Motors, Japan's top maker of trucks, which closed higher on expectations the company's earnings would be aided by increased public works spending, which could mean construction companies will need to buy more trucks. Construction issues, however, were mostly lower.    Pulp and paper companies were higher in a reaction to a recent bout of profit-taking, one dealer said. Prominent among the gainers was Oji Paper, which rose 10 yen to close at 1,200 yen ($9.28).    Dealers said retail stocks were higher on renewed speculation of a faster pace of growth in consumer spending.    Nippon Mining rose 32 yen to 507 yen. Dealers said the company attracted buyers with its announcement yesterday that it has developed a new video recording head for high-resolution television systems.    In London, the Financial Times 30-share index was off three points to close at 1420.10. Volume was a very modest 353.2 million shares, down from 399.9 million Monday. The 100-share index was off 2.5 points at 1774.40, after being as high as 1784.50 earlier in the day.    The market rose to its intraday peak during the morning session as participants began to recover from Monday's surprise increase in base lending rates. Major British banks put up their base rates by half a percentage point to 9% following a signal from the Bank of England, which raised its dealing rates. The move provoked Monday's 13.9-point drop in the Financial Times 100-share index.    After recovering from the surprise of the base lending rate increase, market participants were relieved the increase was limited to half a point. But the market then drifted back into negative territory after a weak early trend on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 4.15 points in New York at midafternoon yesterday, soon after the London market closed.    Major shares were mixed at the close, with 46 of the stocks in the 100-share index showing losses, 42 showing gains and the remainder unchanged. Among widely traded stocks, Imperial Chemical Industries was off 15 pence at #10.58 ($18.60), Glaxo Holdings was off 16 pence at #10.34 and General Electric Co. was off a penny at 156 pence.    Bank shares were generally higher following a warning from the Bank of England's governor to major banks against excessive loss provisions for developing-country debt. The banks currently are preparing their 1987 balance sheets.    Dealers said bank shares were also helped by speculative buying ahead of the declaration of their final dividends. Barclays rose four pence to 489, Lloyds was up 11 at 259 and National Westminster rose four to 602. Grand Metropolitan was up three pence at 457 after confirming its withdrawal from the battle for control of the French cognac maker Martell andamp; Cie. Grand Met said it intends to sell its 21.8% stake in Martell to the rival bidder Seagram Co. of Canada.    Life insurance shares were weaker after newspaper reports that their actuaries had been told by the government to take into account the potential effect of AIDS in the valuation of their liabilities from the end of 1987.    Prudential was off 20 pence at 843 and Legal andamp; General dropped 14 to 274.    In Frankfurt, dealers said that although the market sentiment remains on the positive side for West German stocks, the trading volume yesterday was very low.    &quot;The market is uncertain where the dollar is heading now,&quot; said a trader with a major bank in Frankfurt. &quot;Many people are staying on the sidelines.&quot;    Foreign investors also weren't active yesterday, traders said. But those who were, mostly were selling.    &quot;The entire market felt a bit wishy-washy today,&quot; said one dealer.    In automotives, Porsche fell 12 marks to 408 marks ($241). Traders said the luxury-car maker's shares remain under pressure after its announcement that it will cut production and investment in the current fiscal year as well as dividends for the past year.    Other car makers weakened on profit-taking, traders said. Bayerische Motoren Werke dipped five marks to 485 marks, while Daimler-Benz declined 3.50 marks to 547.50 marks.    Among electricals, Siemens eased three marks to 342 marks. The company said Monday its group net income fell 4% to 285 million marks ($168.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 1987.    Meanwhile, stocks closed higher in Paris, Brussels and Johannesburg, and were lower in Amsterdam, Zurich, Milan and Stockholm.    Shares were up across the board in Paris in active trading, boosted by signs that long-term interest rates may be coming down in the U.S. and by a growing perception that many French companies are vulnerable to takeover attempts. Food, retailing and electrical companies generally were up, but oil shares mostly retreated.    In Milan, trading in shares within the Ferruzzi-Montedison group was suspended. Investors continued to express their unfavorable view of the Ferruzzi-Montedison restructuring plan, unloading the group's shares for the second straight day. The massive move out of these stocks helped drag other issues down, brokers said.    Asian markets varied. Prices closed lower in Hong Kong, Singapore and Wellington, were mixed in Sydney and closed higher in Manila and Taipei.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                      % This                                  Feb 1   Jan 29      Year U.S. ........................... 236.7    238.5     +  3.2 Britain ........................ 537.0    541.6     +  4.1 Canada ......................... 336.0    338.5     -  4.2 Japan ......................... 1136.1   1132.9     + 11.1 France ......................... 262.3    258.1     -  9.1 Germany ........................ 147.9    145.6     -  5.5 Hong Kong ..................... 1654.3   1688.5     +  0.6 Switzerland .................... 143.7    141.4     +  2.1 Australia ...................... 243.4    247.3     -  6.1 World index .................... 413.8    417.2     +  1.4</TEXT></DOC>
