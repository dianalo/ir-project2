The U.N. hasbeen scratching its head, for example, over what to do aboutthe veto, that is, the permanent Security Council seat.Officially it belongs to Gorbachev's Soviet Union, but thereal power seems to be Boris Yeltsin's Russia. The StateDepartment, meanwhile, is wondering whom to ring up about the&quot;details&quot; left dangling when Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachevsigned a strategic-weapons treaty in St. Vladimir's Hall ofthe Kremlin in July.   There will be a whirlwind of such issues until the formercommunist empire shakes itself out. But in the confusion,there is one issue that carries a special urgency, becauseit's dangerous, because it's timely, because Boris Yeltsinhimself has something personally to contribute. This issue isthe Soviet programs of bacteriological warfare.</LP><TEXT>   Western powers have a primary interest in all arms of theSoviet military, of course. Presumably a democratic Russiawould not only agree but actively want to cut these forces toa more reasonable and less threatening size. But even whilesaluting the dawn of a new age, the Western powers shouldn'tlet their attention slip too far from the Soviet nucleararsenal, the tank armies that have threatened Europe and theintercontinental missiles that threaten the U.S. Do theRussians, as the START agreement allows, really plan a newgeneration of heavy missiles?   For all the dangers of nuclear radiation and all thehorrors of chemical warfare, though, at least these weaponsdo not breed and multiply on their own. We do not tend totake an alarmist view of environmental dangers, but we aregiven pause by the possibility of a newly virulent virusbeing released from a germ-warfare laboratory and bringing usa new plague. Even in normal times the Soviet safety recordis nothing to brag about, and while the coup has beenoverturned with little bloodshed there is a still a potentialfor strife and unrest in disputes between factions or ethnicgroups.   Most attention has focused on the possibility of a nuclearaccident, but at least in this case we have a reasonable ideaof what dangers we're dealing with. The same is true ofchemical agents, though the possibility of surprise remains.But we know almost nothing about the potential range ofbiological agents, or especially about refugees' reports thatthe Soviet military has pursued a program of using geneticengineering to produce new biological-warfare agents.   These pages have done their best to call attention to theSoviet biological programs. Most of the attention, of course,focused on two incidents. One was the &quot;yellow-rain&quot; attacksin Southeast Asia. The U.S. government charged that theseinvolved a biological toxin that had to be of Soviet origin.The second incident was the anthrax epidemic near Sverdlovskin 1979, which the U.S. government charged was caused by anaccident at a biological-weapons facility. No one could everprove either charge to the satisfaction of Harvard ProfessorMatthew Meselson, the intellectual godfather of the treatyoutlawing biological weapons. And while the &quot;arms-controlcommunity&quot; tended to find his credibility higher than ourgovernment's, the latter never withdrew its assertions.   Glasnost has already been shedding some light on thematter. Last August the Literaturnaya Gazeta publishedinterviews with medical personnel who treated some of theSverdlovsk victims, excerpted here November 28. They givesome hint of the potential. N. Bezrukov, an anesthesiologist,was quoted: &quot;The symptoms were unlike those of pneumonia;everything flared up instantaneously and went to emphysema.The patients died on an artificial respirator, receivingtremendous doses of medicine. Then a culture arrived from ourlaboratory -- probably malignant anthrax, but not absolutelyfor certain.&quot; This is a description not of skin or intestinalanthrax, the common kind, but of rare pulmonary anthrax, theonly plausible explanation of which would be a biologicalagent.   Mr. Yeltsin does not have to pry information on this eventfrom his military bureaucracy. He was first secretary of theCommunist Party in Sverdlovsk when it happened. In hisbiography, &quot;Against the Grain,&quot; he mentions discussing theepidemic with officials of the KGB. It would have been unfairto press the incident when he already had enough problemswith the forces its revelation would disturb. But now he haswon and is a free man. Indeed, getting out the truth is asmuch in his interest as in everyone else's. The Americangovernment ought to ask him.   Especially so since it's time for the five-year reviewspecified by the Biological Warfare Convention of 1972. TheU.S. has officially raised the issue of Soviet noncompliance,and the Soviets promised some discussions. But right now, andmaybe for the next five years, it's caught up in theanyone-to-talk-to? dilemma. The review session convenes inGeneva on September 9, which is to say, less than two weeksfrom today.</TEXT></DOC>
