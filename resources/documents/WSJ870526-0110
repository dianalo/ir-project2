But the court restricted access to the report to Chris-Craft Chairman Herbert Siegel. Under the ruling, Mr. Siegel can't disclose the contents to anyone, including his son and fellow Chris-Craft executive, William Siegel, unless Warner agrees to the disclosure. Herbert Siegel must seek court approval if Warner, a New York-based entertainment concern, objects to any further disclosure.    New York-based Chris-Craft, which has interests in energy and communications, filed the suit May 15, seeking access to the report after negotiations broke down over Warner's attempts to purchase a 20% block of its stock held by Chris-Craft's BHC subsidiary. Warner owns a 42.5% interest in BHC.    In court papers filed Friday, Chris-Craft disputed Warner's account of the negotiations, saying that it was Mr. Siegel, and not Warner, who terminated buyback discussions. The papers also said that Mr. Siegel had asked for a copy of the report well before the negotiations broke down.    A summary of the report was presented to Warner's board last May. According to Warner, the summary said the report exonerated Warner's chairman and chief executive officer, Steven J. Ross, and other current Warner executives from any wrongdoing in connection with the company's 1973 purchase of stock in Westchester Premier Theatre of Tarrytown, N.Y., a now-defunct company linked by federal prosecutors to organized crime interests.    Mr. Siegel has said he wants to review the report to determine whether he should support the reelection of two Warner directors at the annual meeting scheduled for June 24 -- Mr. Ross and Lawrence Buttenwieser, a director involved in an audit committee that reviewed the Westchester report.    Chris-Craft, which has declined to comment on the fight, said in its court filing Friday that Warner has made &quot;intemperate and inflammatory&quot; statements regarding Mr. Siegel's conduct at Warner board meetings. Chris-Craft added that Warner wrongly accused it of extortion regarding the buyback negotiations and of using the request for the report as &quot;a sham and a pretext,&quot; raising issues that are &quot;15 years old and totally unrelated to Warner's current business affairs when (Warner executives) well know the matter had been subject of board and committee actions within the last year.&quot;    While the ruling appears to be a victory for Chris-Craft, Warner said it regards it as favorable because of the Delaware judge's ruling that Warner &quot;has established an important corporate interest in the confidentiality of the report.&quot; Warner had argued that all the executives who testified for the report did so under promise of privacy. </TEXT></DOC>
