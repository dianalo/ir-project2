Yes, you read it correctly.   This seemingly illogical, almost impossible state of affairs _cost cutting leading to inflation _ illustrates the perniciousfinancial nature of the health-care beast, which avoids the mostcarefully laid anti-inflation traps.   The origins of the latest price spurt go back to the early andmid-1980s when, you might recall, health-care officials in everyarea of the industry felt drastic measures were required.   At that time, according to a consultant on corporate benefits,the William M. Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen concern, many state Medicaidprograms, private-sector benefit plans and Medicare tackled costswith a vengeance.   Among other things, they implemented case-based hospitalreimbursement systems, set up hospital utilization review programsand shifted costs from employers to employees. Dispensers and usersof services, therefore, would be put on the side of costcontainment. It would be in their financial interest.   It worked. Hospital utilization and occupancy rates fell.   While that might seem to be a positive result, it wasn'tentirely so. The reason: To hospitals, each dollar saved throughcost containment was a revenue dollar lost. To correct it, they hadto cut expenses _ or rebuild revenues.   Cutting expenses can appear easier than it is. For example,hospitals have many fixed costs for plant and equipment that do nodecline as occupancy rates fall. The situation can forceadministrators to seek higher revenues.   The most frustrating illustration of this, according to theconsulting firm's report, is in ambulatory surgery.   In designing cost-containment strategies, many sponsors ofhealth insurance plans identified hospital surgical procedures thatcould be performed safely in an outpatient surgical facility.   These sponsors began to encourage workers to have certain typesof surgery performed on an outpatient basis, thus saving the costof a one-day or two-day hospital stay. Employees were offeredfinancial incentives to do so.   Now, says Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen, these corporate sponsors arefinding that outpatient facility charges are as high as $3,000 foras little as a few hours use.   ``Ironically,'' it states, ``in many instances plan costs wouldactually be reduced if these surgeries were again performed in thehospital, since the cost of one day there can be less expensivethan the surgical facility charge.''   This is just one illustration of the difficulties involved inholding the line on health care costs. There are plenty of otherreasons, including the changing natures of health and illnessthemselves.   AIDS, for instance, was not a cost factor until relativelyrecently. Now, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that totalexpenses for one patient might be as high as $150,000 betweendiagnosis and death.   Other cost problems involve the increasing price of medicaleducation, an investment that must be recovered; the surging costof certain malpractice insurance, and the defensive medical testsand procedures now being used.   But much of the inflation problems lie within the nature of theindustry itself. Putting a dollar cost on life remains one of man'smost difficult challenges, one from which even the most hardnosedexecutives retreat.   Meanwhile, many companies and others who sponsor healthinsurance plans are confronted with enormous increases in theirbills.   While the economy in general worries about 4.5 percentinflation, the consulting firm's report states that many plansponsors have seen their bills rise this year by 30 percent to 80percent.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Friday, Oct. 7.</NOTE></DOC>
