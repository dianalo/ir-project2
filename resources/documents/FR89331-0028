This prohibitionwas applicable only to farm labor contractors. Until 1986, FLCRA and MSPAwere the only Federal laws with such a prohibition. Sanctions for violationincluded assessment of civil money penalties, injunctive action, and therevocation or refusal to issue or renew a contractor's certificate of registration.Enactment of IRCA made the prohibition against the knowing employment ofunauthorized workers applicable to all employers. The prohibition becamepart of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and was removed fromMSPA. Determinations regarding the status of aliens are the responsibilityof the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and are subject toregulations issued by that agency. Accordingly, MSPA regulations are amendedto reflect the changes required by IRCA. It should be noted, however, thata determination by INS that a farm labor contractor has knowingly employedan unauthorized alien is still a basis for DOL action regarding that contractor'scertificate of registration.IRCA also requires the furnishing of certificates to an agent of the UnitedStates Government by all employers who, during the period October 1, 1988to September 30, 1992, employ workers whose status was adjusted under Sections210 (seasonal agricultural workers) and 210A (additional seasonal agriculturalworkers, or replenishment agricultural workers) of the INA in seasonalagricultural services. Additional reports are required during the periodOctober 1, 1989, to September 30, 1992, to replenishment agricultural workerswho are admitted under section 210A engaged in seasonal agricultural services.Special employment protection is also provided with respect to such replenishmentworkers. All of these requirements are set forth in full in 29 CFR Part502, 53 FR 35154 (September 9, 1988). Therefore they are not included inthis regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>Three comments were received concerning seven sections of the proposedregulations. The following summarizes the comments received, states theDepartment's response to those comments and indicates any changes whichhave been made as a result of those comments on a section-by-section basis.Discussion of comments on andSection;andSection; 500.171 and 500.172 concerningprotections afforded with respect to replenishment workers is not includedbut these comments were considered in the promulgation of Part 502.Section 500.20(y) DefinitionsOne commenter expressed the view that the language in paragraph (y) statingthat ``the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as amended by the ImmigrationReform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) is codified in 8 U.S.C. 1101 <T3>et seq. </T3>. . .'' is in error and has, in fact, never been codified.INA has, however, been set out in the U.S. Code at Title 8. The languagein paragraph (y) is, therefore, amended to read ``set out'' instead of``codified.''Section 500.51(g) Refusal To Issue or To Renew, or Suspension or Revocationof Certificate of RegistrationOne commenter suggested that the taking of certificate action against afarm labor contractor who is found to have violated section 274(a) (1)or (2) of INA, which prohibits the knowing employment of illegal aliens,should be reserved for ``pattern and practice'' violators under INA and/orfor violators who have not paid fines and penalties levied by INA afterissuance of final orders. This section lists the criteria under which theSecretary may initiate an action to deny a farm labor contractor certificateof registration. Since paragraph (g) reflects the actual criteria of theINA, no change was made to this section.Section 500.212 Request for HearingOne commenter expressed concern that the time period for requesting a hearingwas being changed from ``. . . no later than thirty (30) days after serviceof the notice . . . `to' . . . no later than thirty (30) days after thedate of issuance of the notice. . . .'' The time period for requestinga hearing has not been changed. The new language provides clarificationof the existing procedures as governed by the ``Rules of Practice and Procedurefor Administrative Hearings Before the Office of Administrative Law Judges''as stated in andSection; 500.219 of these regulations. No change was made.Other ProvisionsNo comments were received on the following proposed amendments, which arebeing adopted as final.Section 500.1(i)(4) Purpose and ScopeSection 500.1(i)(4) discusses the fact that MSPA prohibits a farm laborcontractor from recruiting, hiring, employing, or using, with knowledge,the services of aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence orwho have not been authorized by the Attorney General to accept employment.It also discusses the use of optional form WH-509 to self certify thatan applicant is a citizen of the U.S. Since IRCA removes the prohibitionconcerning illegal aliens from MSPA and these regulations, this sectionand form WH-509 are deleted.Section 500.20 DefinitionsBoth ``migrant agricultural worker'' (defined in paragraph (p)) and ``seasonalagricultural worker'' (defined in paragraph (r)) are defined as ``an individualwho is employed in agricultural employment of a seasonal or other temporarynature. . . .'' Following this common beginning, each definition explainedthe provisions unique to that category of worker. The term ``on a seasonalor other temporary basis'' was defined within the discussion of ``seasonalagricultural worker,'' although it was intended to apply equally to bothtypes of agricultural worker. In order to clarify that ``on a seasonalor other temporary basis'' pertains equally to both a ``migrant agriculturalworker'' and a ``seasonal agricultural worker,'' this definition is beingredesignated as paragraph ``s.'' All subsequent paragraphs are also redesignatedto maintain the proper alphabetical sequence.Section 500.50(b)(1) Duration of CertificateSection 500.50(b)(1) is expanded to fully explain what constitutes the``filing'' of an application for renewal of a certificate of registration.Section 500.58 Prohibition Against Recruiting, Hiring, Employing, or Usingan Alien not Lawfully Admitted for Permanent Residence or Authorized byAttorney General to Accept EmploymentSince IRCA removes the prohibition concerning illegal aliens from MSPAand these regulations, this section is deleted.Section 500.59 Good Faith Reliance on DocumentsSince IRCA removes the prohibition concerning illegal aliens from MSPAand these regulations, this section is deleted.Section 500.147 Continuation of Matters Involving Violations of Section106 of MSPAIRCA removed the prohibition concerning illegal aliens from MSPA and theseregulations. This new section provides that any matter involving a certificateaction or a civil money penalty assessment, for a violation of section106 of MSPA or section 500.58 of these regulations, which occurred priorto June 1, 1987, shall continue through final administrative determination.Additional Procedural ChangesThe following procedural amendments contained in andSection; 500.220 andandSection;andSection; 500.263 through 500.269 are designed to clarify theadministrative procedure under which a party may request review by theSecretary of an Administrative Law Judge Decision and Order, and are beingadopted as a final rule without prior notice and comment. The Departmenthas determined that these amendments need not be published as a proposedrule, as generally required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),since this rulemaking merely reflects agency organization, procedure, orpractice, which is thus exempt from notice and comment by virtue of section553(b)(A) of the APA.Section 500.220 GeneralA minor amendment is made to andSection; 502.220 to conform to the rulesof the Department's Administrative Law Judges at 29 CFR Part 18. Thus theregulation provides that where an exception is filed by mail, five dayswill be added to the prescribed time for filing.Section 500.263 Authority of the SecretarySection 500.263 is amended to provide that the Secretary may modify a decisionwhenever in the Secretary's view it warrants modification.Section 500.264 Procedures for Initiating ReviewA new andSection; 500.264 spells out the procedures for petitioning for reviewby the Secretary.Section 500.265 Implementation by the SecretarySection 500.265 makes it clear that the Secretary may exercise review onthe Secretary's own motion or acceptance of a party's petition, and providesthe content of the Secretary's Notice of Intent to Modify or Vacate theDecision. Section 500.267 Filing and ServiceThis section specifies filing procedures. Section 500.268 Final Decision of the Secretary This section has been amended to provide that the Secretary's decisionshall be issued within 120 days from the Secretary's Notice of Intent,granting the petition for review. Section 500.269 Stay Pending Decision of the Secretary This section has been amended to provide that the Secretary will seek astay of proceedings in district court where the Secretary has issued aNotice of Intent. In addition, the section makes it clear that filing apetition with the Secretary does not toll the time for filing an appealin district court. <ITAG tagnum="84">Editorial Changes</ITAG>The following editorial changes have been made to improve the rule. Authority The authority citation for Part 500 is revised to reference the Immigrationand Nationality Act, section 210A(f), Pub. L. 99-603, 100 Stat. 3359 (8U.S.C. 1161(f)). Table of Contents Subparts B, E, and F, of the Table of Contents have been revised. Section 500.20 DefinitionsIn paragraphs (p)(1)(ii) and (r)(2)(i)(C), the section reference is correctedto read 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a). Section 500.220 Service of Determinations and Computation of TimeThe heading for this section has been changed but the content is essentiallythe same as stated in the proposed rule. The Department has concluded thatthe rule will be improved by adopting the language of those sections in29 CFR Part 18 which were previously referenced. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These regulations are not a major rule under Exective Order 12291 becausethey are not likely to result in (1) an annual effect in the economy of$100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, orgeographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofthe United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or foreign markets. Accordingly, no regulatory impact analysisis required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Department believes that this rule will have no ``significant economicimpact upon a substantial number of small entities'' within the meaningof section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354.94 Stat.1164 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)). The Secretary has certified to the Chief Counselfor Advocacy of the Small Business Administration to this effect. Thisconclusion is reached because the rule does not, in itself, impose anyadditional requirements upon small entities. This rule implements changesto MSPA that result from the enactment of IRCA and makes other changesfor clarification purposes. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysisis required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This regulation does not contain any new information collection requirementsand does not modify any existing requirements. Thus, the regulation isnot subject to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.3504(h). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 500</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural associations, Agriculturalworker, Aliens, Carpooling, Day-Haul, Farmer, Farm labor contractor, Health,Housing, Housing standards, Immigration, Insurance, Investigation, Migrantagricultural workers, Migrant labor, Motor carriers, Motor vehicle safety,Occupational safety and health, Penalties, Reporting requirements, Seasonalagricultural workers, Transportation, Wages, Manpower training programs,Labor, Safety.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Chapter V of Title 29 of the Codeof Federal Regulations, Part 500, is amended to read as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC this 23rd day of March, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Elizabeth Dole, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of Labor. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Alan C.
