President Bush is riding high with a war victory and amajor arms agreement with the Soviets. The economy showssigns of a rebound. Even many Democrats think the GOP is agood bet to win its sixth presidential election in the pastseven.</LP><TEXT>   So why can't the Republicans persuade some of their moreattractive figures to run for higher office, especially whensome of the Democratic incumbents won by slim margins?   Candidate recruitment -- the gritty process of findingpolitical talent and then persuading people to run for office-- is one of the principal leading indicators of politics,and as the election season approaches, the Republicans arestumbling. Despite their advantages and the disarray amongtheir Democratic foes, the Republicans show few signs ofmaking any gains on Capitol Hill.   The Republicans are outnumbered by more than 100 seats inthe House and are at a 57-43 disadvantage in the Senate. Onlya political earthquake would make the GOP competitive in theHouse, and the chances of improving its position in theSenate, to say nothing of regaining control of the chamber,seem to be slipping away.   While Democrats recruited strong Senate challengers inIdaho, Indiana, New York, Oregon, Utah and Wisconsin, theRepublicans tried and failed to persuade sitting GOPgovernors to take on potentially vulnerable Senate Democratsin Alabama and South Carolina. Two GOP House members declinedinvitations to run for the Senate in Florida. Only inWashington state are Republican House members running for theSenate.   Many of these Republicans may be scared off less by thefuture than by the past.   &quot;The traditional place you go to recruit Republican Senatecandidates is to persuade perfectly safe House Republicansthat they can win Senate races,&quot; says John Buckley, aRepublican political consultant. &quot;They end up losing theSenate race, and the party ends up losing the House seat.&quot;   In 1970, 11 Republican House members ran for the Senate,and six of them, including Rep. George Bush of Texas, lost.More recently, five Republican House members took on sittingDemocratic senators last fall, and all of them lost. Thethree Republican House members who moved to the Senate wonseats that were being vacated by retiring Republicans, two ofthem in dependably GOP states.   &quot;If you're a member of the House and look over thecasualty list, it sure has to reduce your enthusiasm forwalking into this sort of thing,&quot; says Eddie Mahe, aRepublican political consultant.   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, chairman of the RepublicanSenatorial Campaign Committee, is making a virtue out ofnecessity by playing down efforts to attract House members toSenate races.   &quot;Congressmen can make great candidates for the Senate, butthey're not always the best candidate,&quot; says Mr. Gramm, whohimself moved from the House to the Senate after moving fromthe Democratic Party to the GOP. &quot;And when the public wantsbig change in Washington, they might not regard moving a guyfrom one house to the other as a very big change.&quot;   Even so, Mr. Gramm and the Republicans endureddiscomfiting public dismissals from Gov. Guy Hunt of Alabama,who declined a challenge to freshman Sen. Richard Shelby, andGov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, a former Housemember who declined a challenge to Sen. Ernest Hollings, whois regarded by members of both parties as vulnerable. Theirrefusals were all the more disappointing because bothgovernors have terms that end in 1995 and thus would not havejeopardized their positions had they accepted the challenge.   Mr. Gramm insists he's on the lookout for what he callsthe &quot;Wendell Wilkie type,&quot; a person who has never run foroffice but who could run as a politically attuned outsider.Like GOP House recruiters, who have an eye on returning warveterans, Mr. Gramm has been courting people like state Rep.Jim Gibbons of Nevada, a Vietnam veteran and decorated pilotin the Persian Gulf War. But Mr. Gibbons said last week hewon't challenge incumbent Sen. Harry Reid.   &quot;I'm not going to be the coach who is so caught up withwhether the media rates the players as blue-chip,&quot; says Mr.Gramm. &quot;I'm not worried about what the media says about myrecruiting.&quot;   Even so, many Republicans are troubled by their party'sfailure to enlist attractive candidates. Just as Democratsare frustrated by being locked out of the White House,Republicans have grown impatient with the decades ofDemocratic rule on Capitol Hill.   &quot;This is the election where we have to make significantgains to end that Democratic entrenchment, and it's nothappening,&quot; says Edward Rollins, former head of theRepublican Congressional Campaign Committee. &quot;You always haveto worry when candidate recruiting wanes. We have clearopportunities in the Senate, without candidates, and that'sbad. It takes a long time to get a candidate up to speed, andit's getting very, very late. The clock is running, and we'rebehind.&quot;   Even the assumption of Democratic rule of Congress worksto Democrats' advantage. &quot;We find that people are eager tocome to a majority,&quot; says Laura Nichols, communicationsdirector for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.&quot;They (Republicans) don't have that to offer.&quot;   At the same time, the Republicans' efforts are stymied bytheir own success at portraying Congress as a hopelesslymuddled bastion of partisanship and privilege.   &quot;Congress's lack of performance has made Republicans askwhy they would want to be a part of it,&quot; says Kevin Phillips,a Republican political theorist. &quot;The Democrats areperfecting the `forwardfumble' theory of politics.&quot;   But the Democrats, with an overwhelming advantage in thestate legislatures, are better positioned to find candidatesthan are the Republicans, whose power center is the WhiteHouse.   &quot;We have a much better farm system,&quot; says Sen. CharlesRobb of Virginia, chairman of the Democratic SenatorialCampaign Committee. &quot;We have traditionally had morewell-qualified people who have started in state legislaturesand in other state offices. That gives us an advantage. Butyou would think with a federal election with a popularpresident, they would have more people eagerly stepping up tothe plate.&quot;   Tom Cole, executive director of the National RepublicanCongressional Committee, says he believes the GOP has a&quot;strong crop&quot; of House candidates for 1992. But the shape ofnext year's House races is uncertain because states haven'tfinished drawing new congressional districts. And in Senateraces, where 21 Democratic seats and 15 GOP seats are atstake, the Democrats have a large cushion and are in a strongposition.   Although Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is expected tomake a strong run against newly appointed Democratic Sen.Harris Wofford, and a number of Republicans are preparingchallenges to Democratic Sen. Brock Adams of Washington, anumber of sitting Republicans -- including John Seymour ofCalifornia, Alfonse D'Amato of New York, Bob Packwood ofOregon and Steve Symms of Idaho -- face strong Democraticchallenges.   But political analysts warn of the uncertainties ofpolitics. At this point in the last campaign cycle,Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz -- well-liked, well-financed-- seemed in a commanding position in Minnesota. Hardlyanyone paid any attention to an unknown professor and JesseJackson supporter -- who won 50.4% of the vote and now isSen. Paul Wellstone.</TEXT></DOC>
