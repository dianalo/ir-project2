Minor amounts of (Fe,Ni) silicides and silicon sulfides are also produced. The distributioncoefficient for Ni/Fe exchange between (Mg, Fe)S and (Fe, Ni)S is about24 and is significantly greater than that for coexisting niningeriteand troilite in EH enstatite chondrites. Experimental studies in theNi-free system, at both subsolidus and liquid iron sulfide temperatures,are in good overall agreement with the calculated phase relations forniningerite. The quenched experimental assemblage is equivalent to thereduced mineral assemblage of EH enstatite chondrites. The present phaserelations suggest that niningerite in EH chondrites could have been producedby sulfidation of Mg-rich silicates during either accretion of metamorphismat low fugacities of CO. However, niningerite is not stable under theanticipated conditions of recrystallization of EL enstatite chondrites.The assemblage is unstable under magmatic conditions at low and moderatecrustal pressures.</TEXT></DOC>
