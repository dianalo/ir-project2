There have been no signs of violence, no signs ofillness _ nothing to suggest who or what may have killed them.   Was it a serial killer who knows how to hide signs of violence?A deadly new form of drug abuse? Investigators don't know.   Last week, after a new wave of publicity, Dade County MedicalExaminer Joseph Davis officially declared the cases homicides. ButDavis acknowledges that the cause of death remains unknown, andinvestigators say they are as frustrated as before.   ``If, in fact, there is a killer or killers out there, or ifit's caused by crack cocaine, we just don't know yet,'' says JohnFarrell, chief of the headquarters division of detectives forMetro-Dade police. ``We consider them open cases and we'reinvestigating them as if they were homicides.''   FBI behavioral scientists and experts from the national Centersfor Disease Control in Atlanta have been called in by localauthorities to study the sparse data. Their reports are notcomplete.   Farrell notes that there is not even a proven link among thedeaths, which began in September 1986. However, there is a pattern.   The bodies of all but one of the women were found in a narrow,predominantly black section of Miami and an adjoining,unincorporated area of Dade County. They were lying in overgrownvacant lots, abandoned houses or back alleys. The victims' skirtswere up or pants down, indicating recent sexual activity. All buttwo had traces of cocaine in their blood. Most were known aswilling to trade sex for crack money.   None, however, showed any signs of trauma or violence, and thecause of death is listed as unknown. The latest known victim, PeggyGooden, 27, was discovered April 2.   ``The geographic distribution of these cases lends support to apresumption of probable homicide based on ... the absence of otherproven alternatives at this time,'' Davis said.   There are several theories on what is killing the women, butthere are problems with each.   If a serial killer is at work, he has gone to great lengths tohide his method of killing the women. The working assumption isthat the killer would somehow strangle or smother them _ adifficult cause of death to establish.   And police say it strains credulity that the women would quietlysuffocate without screaming, fighting or resisting enough to showsigns of trauma.   The serial killer theory has a different problem. There are noreports from other street people of suspects, and no close escapesmatching the circumstances of the deaths.   Dr. Lee Hearn, chief toxicologist for the medical examiner'soffice, says the bodies were even checked for cyanide, but notraces were found. People who are poisoned generally show signs ofillness before their deaths, and none of the women did.   That leaves the possibility of a previously unknown kind ofchemical reaction in which small amounts of cocaine _ perhapscoupled with genetic factors, a rundown physical condition orsexual stimulation _ resulted in sudden death.   But that theory too has holes, Hearn notes. Why isn't the samephenomenon occurring outside this narrow area, in New York, LosAngeles or even neighboring Fort Lauderdale? And why is itaffecting only black women? There are plenty of white crack addictsas well.   Two of the women had no cocaine at all in their bloodstreams,Hearn notes, although it is always possible that their cases areunrelated to the rest.   One possible explanation for the narrow geographicaldistribution of the deaths could be a single dealer distributingcrack that is cut with a deadly chemical. But officers sent outinto the area to buy samples have found nothing unusual. Hearn saystests didn't disclose any such toxic agent.   ``We just don't know what's killing them,'' Farrell says. ``Andthe people in the street are just as confused as we are. Some thinkit's a killer, and some think it's the crack. But we'll keep oninvestigating, and we'll find an answer.''</TEXT></DOC>
