It isn't just microwave field rations and &quot;smart&quot;anti-aircraft missiles that set this army apart. Its mostradical departure is its people.</LP><TEXT>   They are a demographic mix the nation has never sent intobattle before. Much higher percentages are women, are blacks,are married, are parents. More of them are high schoolgraduates, and most of them have been trained in the desertconditions they will have to fight in. In short, they seem tobe a far cry from the ill-prepared, mostly draftee armies theU.S. cobbled together for Korea and Vietnam.   On paper, they make the post-Vietnam, all-volunteer Armylook like a grand social experiment that has succeeded. Whatremains to be seen is whether, in fact, this Army is reallyready to fight.   The limited evidence sometimes runs contrary toexpectation. Today's soldier, for instance, is apt to beolder and more settled than his or her Vietnam counterpart,and &quot;conventional wisdom would say that young single peoplewould be more risk-takers than older married people,&quot; saysMartin Binkin, an analyst at the Brookings Institution. &quot;Butwe've seen studies that show that sometimes your Rambos breakdown and your Woody Allens rise to the occasion.&quot;   Adds Charles Moskos, a military sociologist atNorthwestern University, &quot;The general finding we have is thatthe older soldiers fought better than younger ones.&quot;   The ultimate test of this army's readiness to fight, if itcomes, would begin here in the Saudi desert near the Kuwaitiborder, where Col. Douglas Starr's non-regulation,Bedouin-like tent is pitched under a clear desert skybrimming with stars. The colonel commands the Third ArmoredCavalry Regiment. Led by tanks and armored personnelcarriers, its several thousand troops -- military regulationsbar publication of more specific figures -- would likely beamong the first to face Iraqi bullets, because the regiment'swar mission is to scout and make initial contact with theenemy.   The cautious West Pointer says the most accurate test ofhis unit's fighting ability so far came at the Army'sNational Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif. There, itfought three mock battles in the Mojave Desert against the&quot;Opposition Force,&quot; an elite unit that uses Soviet-styletactics. The Opfor, as it is known, is rarely beaten, but theThird Cavalry routed them in 1987 and performed well in twomore recent engagements.   It's axiomatic that no one knows how well an army willperform in combat until it has taken casualties. &quot;How thisone is going to fight is something a lot of people would liketo know,&quot; Col. Starr says over the ever-present purring ofelectrical generators needed to power his command post's wallof radios and computers. He is confident, though, that theyare better prepared than a conscript army would be. &quot;Becauseall of them chose to do this . . . you can say that they hada better understanding of what it is that they were gettinginto.&quot;   Positioned a few miles behind Col. Starr in the Saudidesert is the 553rd Corps Support Batallion, which is 14%female. The 553rd's mission is to keep the cavalry unitsupplied with food, fuel, ammunition, water and body bags.Under the Army's rules, women are not supposed to be incombat, but in the quick, highly mobile battle anticipatedhere, the 553rd and the largely male cavalry regiment itsupports will be joined like &quot;Siamese twins,&quot; says Lt. Col.Robert Humberson, commander of the 553rd.   Contrary to Col. Starr's assertion, many of the women heresay they never chose this life. Cpl. Sharpel Bell joined theArmy to get college money to become a lawyer, she says; &quot;itnever occurred to me when I signed up that I would be doingthis.&quot; She worries especially about her three-year-old son,Joshua. Because she is unmarried, Cpl. Bell left her boy backin Shreveport, La., with her mother.   The almost constant presence of women is one of thehallmarks of the new Army. In Vietnam, women made up only aminuscule 1.5% of the Army. Here, over 11% of the soldiersare female; in some support units, the figure is as high as25%. The Army says 16% of its women are, like Cpl. Bell,single parents.   Sergeants who served in the Vietnam era say anotherhallmark of today's Army is that the troops enjoy a morerelaxed discipline, and complain a lot. &quot;You still tell themto do things, but you explain why they're doing it,&quot; saysSgt. Rick Hunt. &quot;You couldn't have the Jack Webb style ofsergeant any more.&quot;   For all their grousing, these troops also have beenbehaving. According to Army statistics, disciplinaryinfractions here are one-third of the Army's normal patternfor a deployment. The fact that G.I. Joe (or Joan) can't getdrunk at the local bar or fraternize much with the locals isonly a partial explanation for the good behavior. An equallyimportant reason is that 53% of today's Army is married,compared with 29% in Korea and 38% in Vietnam.   But those new proportions mean that the Third Armored left3,000 families behind when it left Fort Bliss in El Paso,Texas. Many soldiers at the front have lots to worry about.   Maj. Bob Blackwood, commander of the Third Armored's reardetachment in Texas, recalls walking out of his office oneSaturday afternoon last fall to find the wife of a soldierand two toddlers sitting on the front steps of regimentalheadquarters. Her husband, now deployed to Saudi Arabia, hadfallen far behind on the rent. His paychecks hadn't startedcoming through to her. She had been evicted from herapartment and had no food or money.   Maj. Blackwood tried the local churches, but couldn't findhelp. He gave the woman $60 out of his own pocket. Then, hesays, &quot;I went home to my bedroom and cried.&quot;   Another lesson of the Saudi deployment has been howmarkedly race relations have improved in the military. Racialincidents, an everyday phenomenon in the jungles of Vietnam,seem to be almost nonexistent in the desert. This isespecially important because the enlisted ranks are now 31%black, more than double the percentage in Vietnam.   Sgt. Maj. Ray C. Elliott, a lanky, 46-year-old blackveteran, puts it this way. &quot;In Vietnam you had a {racial}line drawn. Here we've crossed over that line and people areworking together well,&quot; he says. &quot;That's another thing that'sgoing to mean we'll win this thing.&quot;   Col. Starr, the Third Armored Cavalry commander, says themix in other respects is also different from the soldiers heknew in Vietnam. There, he recalls, &quot;I had a Ph.D. in mytroop. I also had guys from the lowest mental category. Theywere virtually unteachable.&quot; Today the college-educateddraftees are gone, but so are the high school dropouts.What's left is from solidly middle-class and lower-middleclass America. Almost all -- 95% -- are high schoolgraduates.   For many Vietnam draftees, the Army was something to beendured and forgotten. To many volunteers here, it is aninstitution that has become entwined with every aspect oftheir lives.   Sgt. Josefina N. Morere, 35 years old, sits in one of thetents doing the Third Armored's paperwork. In high school sheplanned to become a nun, but a chum talked her into joiningthe Army.   Then she married a soldier, who is now serving here inanother combat unit. (The situation isn't all that unusual inSaudi Arabia, since 7% of the troops are married to someoneelse in the Army.) When the call came, both parents shippedout. Sgt. Morere's younger sister assumed full responsibilityfor the couple's two children, aged eight and 11.   Transfer of responsibility for children is an elaborateprocedure under Army regulations, requiring a guardianshipplan, prepared wills and formal financial arrangements toprotect the kids in case both parents die in battle. Onecomplicating factor in the arrangement is that Sgt. Morere'ssister is a lieutenant in the Army Reserve and also couldwind up in Saudi Arabia. If that happens, the children may beshipped to their grandmother in Mexico.   As the waiting in the desert drags on, Sgt. Morere seesher husband, also a sergeant, once a week. &quot;There are nofemales over there {in his unit}, so they're always glad tosee me,&quot; she says. &quot;We play cards and talk about theirfamilies.&quot;   It is sergeants like the Moreres that are the glue of theArmy, teaching their troops to operate complicated weaponssystems, keeping an eye on morale and providing theleadership for small units. One crucial advantage of today'sArmy is that its average sergeant is far more experiencedthan his counterpart in Vietnam. That Army was often led by&quot;shake-and-bake&quot; sergeants, men who had served less thaneight months in the military.   &quot;A lot of people just gave up and got out because ofnon-support at home, more than anything else,&quot; recalls Sgt.Maj. Dennis E. Worley, a beefy 44-year-old man with a largemoustache. Tons of Christmas mail, including letters fromschoolchildren addressed to &quot;any soldier&quot; in Saudi Arabia,are among the signs that tell him that the first venture ofthe all-volunteer Army will be different.   &quot;There's still question marks,&quot; he says. &quot;But we thinkwe've had the best training in the world.&quot;   ---                       In the Army Now...                           and Then                                                                                                          Breakdown of U.S. Army, in percent                                                                                                                                           Desert       Vietnam                                    Shield         Era                                                                                                        High School Graduates              95%            82% Married Soldiers                   53%            38% Black Soldiers                     31%            14% Female Soldiers                     1.5%          11.4%                                                                                                        Private's pay (per month)          $669.00        $115.20                                                                                                          Source: U.S. Army</TEXT></DOC>
