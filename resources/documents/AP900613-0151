In a speech Monday to the annual convention of theAmerican-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a major pro-Israellobbying group, Quayle described two trips he took to Israel. Onone, Quayle said, he was taken by helicopter to the West Bank ofthe Jordan River, an area which Israel captured from Jordan in the1967 Arab-Israeli war.   ``From the hills of Judea and Samaria, you can see the land ofIsrael stretched out before you,'' Quayle said in his preparedremarks. He was referring to the strategic location of those hills,which command a view of Israel's most populated area and theMediterranean Sea beyond.   Israel cites the narrowness of the corridor between the hillsand the Mediterranean as one reason why it needs to control theWest Bank, whose Palestinian population wants independence fromIsraeli and Jordanian control.   Clovis Maksoud, the ambassador of the 21-nation Arab League,said he had asked President Bush to clarify Quayle's remarks.   Maksoud said he had asked whether the Bush administration nowaccepts the definitions of Israeli hardliners, such as PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir, for the occupied territories.   U.S. officials generally refer to the West Bank, as well as tothe Gaza strip which Israel captured from Egypt in 1967, as theoccupied territories. The United States does not recognize Israelisovereignty over those lands and urges negotiations on theirfuture. It views Jewish settlements in those areas as an obstacleto peace.   ``There has been no change in policy,'' said Quayle's spokesman,David Beckwith. ``The vice president was just using the Biblicalnames of those hills.''   ``If the U.S. administration is to hold the PLO responsible forany and all statements and actions by its representatives, we alsohold the Bush administration responsible for statements made by itsvice president,'' Maksoud said.   The administration has demanded the Palestine LiberationOrganization condemn an aborted May 30 raid by one of its factionson Israel's coast.</TEXT></DOC>
