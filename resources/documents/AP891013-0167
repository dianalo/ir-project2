It was the first sales period of the 1990 model year and thefirst in what analysts have said would be a soft three-month period.   The eight major companies making vehicles in North America saidtheir cars and light trucks sold at an average rate of 30,734 a dayduring the Oct. 1-10 period this year, compared with 34,867 duringthe same time last year.   The decline was led by a 24.2 percent fall in GM's car sales anda 28.7 percent decline in the company's truck sales. Overall, theindustry leader's car and truck sales were off 25.6 percent for theperiod.   Ford Motor Co.'s total vehicle sales were down 0.3 percent inearly October and Chrysler Corp.'s were off 2.3 percent.   GM's sales dive may have been spurred by its program ofrewarding dealers who cleared out stocks of 1989 vehicles beforeSept. 30, the end of the 1989 model year.   ``We had a strong, strong, strong month of September and also Ithink there is a lull here in some of the buying,'' GM spokesmanTerry Sullivan said. ``One cannot judge a year on 10 days.''   For the year to date, GM's car sales were down 6.2 percent whiletruck sales were up 2.4 percent. At Ford, year-to-date car saleswere up 0.1 percent and truck sales were down 2 percent, while atChrysler, car sales were off 11.1 percent and truck sales were up0.2 percent.   For months, as word of 1990 model price increases spread,analysts and others have been saying sales in the fourth quarter ofthis year would be considerably softer than during the thirdquarter, when incentives helped.   That ``payback'' may be coming true, said analyst Tom Webb ofthe National Automobile Dealers Association.   ``Sixty to 75 percent (of the early October sales) should havebeen '90s,'' he said.   Webb said he wanted to see how sales go later in the monthbefore saying whether the payback was under way.   GM said its cars sold at an average daily rate of 8,538 duringthe early October period this year, compared with a rate of 11,273during the same period last year. Its early-October truck saleswere reported at an average daily rate of 3,654 compared with arate of 5,126 last year.   Ford said it sold an average of 7,169 cars a day during theperiod this year, compared with 7,301 during the same time lastyear, for a 1.8 percent decline. Truck sales, meantime, rose to anaverage daily rate of 4,299 for the period this year, up 2.4percent from the 4,197 truck-a-day rate in early October last year.   Chrysler's car sales were off 7.5 percent in early October,falling to a daily average of 2,840 this year compared with a rateof 3,071 last year. Truck sales at Chrysler were up 4.3 percent,rising to a daily rate of 2,515 during the period this year,compared with 2,412 last year.</TEXT></DOC>
