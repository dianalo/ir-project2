Thisincrease or decrease in oil quality is due to an increase or decreasein the amount of low boiling to mid-distillate fractions in the shaleoil. In addition, the effects of carbon dioxide and nitrogen retortingon shale oil quality were investigated. It was found that carbon dioxideretorting, in addition to increasing shale oil yield, also increasedshale oil quality. It is thought to increase the quality of the oil byincreasing the amounts of components in the low boiling to mid-distillatefractions.</TEXT></DOC>
