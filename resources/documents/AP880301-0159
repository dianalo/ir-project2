But he added that ``I don't think it is very useful to simplyberate the Europeans on this.''   Carlucci's comments came as President Reagan was heading forEurope to attend a two-day summit meeting of leaders of the16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., the Budget Committee chairman,criticized NATO nations for what he said was ``unequal sharing.''He told Carlucci ``our allies in NATO are not doing, in myestimation, enough for their own defense.''   Criticism of NATO has long been popular on Capitol Hill, wherelegislators have complained time and again that American taxpayersare footing a disproportionate share of the alliance's defense bill.   Gray said the United States is devoting about 6 percent of itsgross national product to defense while no other NATO countriesspend a little more than 3 percent.   Carlucci agreed that ``we need to make every effort to get ourallies to do more,'' but he said they now do more than is``generally recognized.'' For example, Carlucci said, NATO supplies90 percent of the ground troops which would be used to halt aSoviet attack.   America's defense budget is 5.7 percent of the nation's GNP, not6 percent, Carlucci said. He also noted that American defensebudgets have generally stayed even or declined in recent years.   That wasn't good enough for Gray, who noted that the recentreductions came atop large increases in Reagan's first term.   NATO has long set a target for each member to increase spendingby 3 percent a year after inflation, and most nations don't meetthat target, Carluicci said. The United States hasn't met the 3percent target for at least four years, he added.   Both Carlucci and Adm. William Crowe Jr., chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff, told the committee that NATO needs to improve itsconventional defenses in the wake of the treaty banningmedium-range atomic missiles from Europe.   That is similar to the message Reagan is carrying to NATO alliesand echoes a theme which the administration has been pushing sincethe treaty was signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev.   Crowe detailed NATO's shortcomings in non-nuclear weapons, butadded, ``surely the prospect of having to fight 16 nations at onceremains a sobering one for the Kremlin.''   ``But, put candidly, both the level of (nuclear) deterrence andthe nuclear threshold remain too low,'' Crowe said. ``The chiefshave for a number of years consistently testified to that effect.''   ``It is essential for the NATO members to correct'' the problemsin non-nuclear weapons, he said.   At the Senate Budget Committee, Yale historian Paul Kennedy saidthat U.S. allies ``ought to bear a larger share of the defenseburden'' now that they have been rebuilt with U.S. help after WorldWar II.   Kennedy, author of the best-selling ``The Rise and Fall of GreatNations,'' said the United States should spurn protectionism andincrease spending for basic technologies and for commercialresearch and development.   Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,agreed with Kennedy that U.S. allies should bear more of theburden. But she criticized his view that there is a directcorrelation between military spending and economic growth.   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the panel, noted that``the help we gave and the protection we've given have helpedEurope and Asia grow back into power. Now, they are friendlycompetitors. But while they've taken us to the woodshed ininternational trade, we're the ones paying for the guards at thewoodshed door.''   ``It seems to me we are draining our power trying to do toomuch,'' said Chiles. ``Our adversaries are happy to see us try. Ourallies haven't done as much as they can to help.''</TEXT></DOC>
