(Industry Insight) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Vinzant, David R.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>With increasing numbers of business users considering the adoptionof database server technology, major concerns include anevaluation of the speed and the savings that will result.andO;Potential users want to know if a database server can handle theload on their minicomputer and how many users it is capable ofsupporting at how fast a rate.andP;  The advantage of the servertechnology is that it transfers the workload from the workstationto the LAN-connected server through Structured Query Languagemessages.andP;  Recent TP1 benchmarks indicate that Microsoft andAshton-Tate have SQL Server speeds of 10 transactions per secondand that Oracle's MVS product on mainframes can achieve 256 tps.andO;One should bear in mind that these speeds relate to data additionspeed rather than to retrieval time.andP;  Variables such as the numberof users, database size and hardware configuration must be kept inmind for an informed decision.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Distributed Data BasesData Transfer RateStructured Query LanguageBenchmarksInformation Storage and RetrievalCost of Communications.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
