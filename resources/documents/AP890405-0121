About 250 students at China's foremost university, meanwhile,defied a school prohibition and met to discuss political change.   Chinese sources said hundreds of Chinese soldiers filledTiananmen Square early Wednesday morning to prevent against anydemonstrations to commemorate the April 5, 1976 protest thatsignaled the end of the Cultural Revolution.   Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army sealed off aboutthree-fourths of the huge square, including the Monument toRevolutionary Martyrs and the mausoleum of Mao Tse-tung.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said troopsdetained the man when he tried to enter the sealed-off area tocommemorate the 1976 demonstration, held just after the death ofPremier Zhou Enlai.   Thousands of people took part in the demonstration, which markedthe end of the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution. The protest,crushed by police, became a rallying cry for political activists.   One source said the man was detained because he was handing outpamphlets critical of the current regime. Another said he wasdetained because he tried to walk in the restricted area.   At Beijing University, about 250 students gathered to defy whatthey said was a school prohibition on political meetings.   Students said that in recent weeks, university and citygovernment authorities have been stopping the meetings of the``Democracy Salon,'' a student group organized to discuss currentsocial issues.   On Wednesday, Li Shuxian, wife of China's most famous dissident,Fang Lizhi, addressed the students and urged them to pursuedemocratic change.   Student activists also called on classmates to convince theschool to allow the ``Democratic Salon'' to continue. The reaction,although supportive, was tame.   Some students said they were afraid they would be denied accessto good jobs if they supported the movement. Others said theythought calls for freedom of speech and association were hopelessin China.   ``I feel a kind of formless pressure on me that keeps me fromspeaking out,'' said one bespectacled student in a worn Mao suit.``We all do. Many of us don't know what to do. We want to speak outbut we are afraid of all the people here listening.''   Students said the crowd contained many plainclothes police.Throughout the meeting, men hovered around taking photographs.   The open-air meeting began near a statue of Miguel Cervantes,author of ``Don Quixote.'' As the crowd swelled to about 250, itmoved to pavilion a few yards away.   The meeting came two days after a wall-poster appeared atBeijing University urging the university to stop interfering in thesalon. The poster, signed by more than 60 students, said democraticchange in China ``is not simply a matter of saying a few emptywords.''   A school official said the university permitted students to takepart in activities ``as long as they were healthy and good for thestudents.'' But school spokesman Yan Huajiang said if theuniversity believed the activities were ``unhealthy,'' the schoolwould stop them.   History major Wang Dan, an author of the poster, said thepurpose of the group was to ``enliven thought.''   The most recent interference occurred March 29 when cityofficials stopped a professor from another school from addressingthe salon, he said.   Li teaches physics at Beijing University. In 1987, she waselected to the lowest-level People's Congress in the district thatcontains the university.   Fang, her 52-year-old husband, is popular among students andintellectuals because of his view that China's efforts to developits economy won't succeed unless it becomes more democratic.   An increasing number of Chinese intellectuals have been callingfor political change. Since January, intellectuals have writtenfour open letters calling for the release of political prisonersand democratic change.   But government officials have ruled out an amnesty andsoftpedaled any talk of democratic change. China also maintains ithas no political prisoners.</TEXT></DOC>
