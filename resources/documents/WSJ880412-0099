Martini andamp; Rossi for Benedictine S.A. was approved by the French Economics Ministry, portending a resumption of Martini andamp; Rossi's fight with Remy-Martin S.A. for control of the French liqueur and luxury-products group.    The battle has been suspended since February while Martini andamp; Rossi's bid was considered by the Economics Ministry. A ministry spokeswoman yesterday said the Swiss-controlled drinks group obtained the approval required for companies from outside the European Community to bid for French concerns.    She said the proposed bid of 6,550 French francs ($1,154.29) a share can proceed as soon as it gets approval from the Paris Stockbrokers' Association. Martini andamp; Rossi's bid values Benedictine at 917 million francs ($161.6 million), based on the current number of shares outstanding, or at 971 million francs if the target company carries out plans for a capital boost meant to defend itself from Remy Martin.    Martini andamp; Rossi launched its bid for Benedictine in order to fend off Remy Martin, the French cognac maker, which is seeking 60% of Benedictine at a price of 6,200 francs a share. Remy Martin officials couldn't be reached yesterday to comment on the possibility of a higher bid. They have indicated in the past, however, that such a bid was a serious possibility.    French rules allow Remy Martin to raise its offer as long as the new bid is at least 5% more than the current high bid. That would force it to offer at least 6,877.5 francs a share, and some analysts have expressed doubt that it wants to spend that much. Benedictine's stock is suspended at 6,100 francs a share. </TEXT></DOC>
