The government of Russia, the largest and richest of the 15Soviet republics, was among 20 organizations and individuals whichfounded the exchange last month.   ``We would like to take in the first place a very primitivestep,'' Fyodorov said of the decision to start by trading bondsbefore gradually introducing securities. He spoke at a seminar onRussia's economic future.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued sweeping decrees inOctober permitting individual Soviets to buy stocks, bonds andother securities for the first time in 73 years.   Trading in shares was outlawed following the 1917 BolshevikRevolution and allowed only a brief revival during the 1920s beforebeing abolished by Josef Stalin.   The Russian-supported exchange is smaller and separate from theMoscow Stock Exchange founded in November by 187 companies. TheMoscow Stock Exchange has not yet set an opening date, but hasambitious plans to open offices in the New York, Frankfurt, Tokyoand Singapore stock exchanges.   Fyodorov said the Moscow International Stock Exchange has only10 million rubles, or about $5.5 million, in capital, compared with61.5 million rubles, or about $34.1 million, for the Moscow StockExchange.   ``We hope that the first session will be in the beginning ofJanuary with the state bonds,'' he said.   Bonds, usually issued by governments, are considered less riskythan stocks because they pay the buyer a fixed annual interest rateand mature at a specified future date.   Western advisers helping the Soviet government revive tradingsay bonds will also be easier for inexperienced investors tounderstand.</TEXT></DOC>
