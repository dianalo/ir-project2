Not Banc One Corp.    The Columbus, Ohio, banking concern draws attention to itself with innovative -- and controversial -- moves in retail banking and in non-bank activities, moves since widely imitated in the industry. It was first to help securities firms offer bank-like services, it installed the first automated teller machines and was the first affiliate to issue BankAmericard, the forerunner of Visa.    Want a bank credit card that gives you Sandamp;H Green Stamps? Or maybe you'd like to plan an overseas vacation. Banc One will soon offer such products and services in several redesigned branches, which will resemble small shopping malls with separate storefronts for banking services, brokerage sales, travel planning and insurance.&quot; And, when the giant American Association of Retired Persons last month sought help to market a new credit union for its 29 million members, it tapped Banc One.    As other super-regional banks pushed aggressively into the hot middle-market corporate lending business and some investment banking activities, Banc One has pursued the low-key consumer banking market. It processes and issues millions of credit cards and has become a leading financier of what some bankers consider penny ante business -- such as health club memberships and consumer appliances.    &quot;Some laughed when we said we wanted to finance health club memberships,&quot; says John B. McCoy, Banc One's 44-year-old chief executive officer. &quot;But we like the consumer side of the business because the profit margins are high.&quot;    Banc One's consumer business, led by its personal loans and credit cards, is clearly a powerful profit source. In 1987, the company generated net interest margins of 5.8%, compared with a 4.4% average for the 35 regional banks tracked by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. The average yield of Banc One's loan portfolio last year was 11.58%, compared with a 12-bank average of 10.35% for super-regionals. The regional and super-regional banks have grown steadily in recent years as interstate banking laws are relaxed. They also have been stronger than money-center banks because they generally have little or no problem Third World debt in their portfolios.    Charles N. Cranmer, a Goldman Sachs banking analyst, considers Banc One one of &quot;the strongest and best-managed&quot; of the major regional banks the investment firm follows.    Still, the banking concern's reliance on the consumer has some investors uneasy. Banc One's $1.5 billion credit card portfolio makes it especially vulnerable to economic downturns. Should a recession emerge, a sharp drop in consumer spending and rising interest rates could wipe out the generous spreads that Banc One has come to enjoy. Credit cards alone, which amount to 10% of its loans outstanding, contribute 20% to 25% of Banc One's net interest income. &quot;To a certain extent, Banc One's growth is based on consumers' ability to keep on buying,&quot; said Timothy C. McCombs, a banking analyst at Ohio Co. in Columbus.    Banc One's large consumer exposure already has led to above-average loan losses. Net domestic charge-offs in 1987 measured 1.02% of loans, much higher than the 0.7% Goldman Sachs average for regionals. Credit card write-offs accounted for half of that, or roughly 5% of total credit card receivables.    But, Mr. McCoy contends, &quot;I've never seen a bank go under because of bad consumer loans. Banks fail because of bad real estate and bad commercial loans. The consumer side is safe and easy.&quot;    Beneath that confident exterior, Mr. McCoy has a cautious approach. To reduce its consumer exposure, the company has securitized large portions of its credit card receivables and is selling them to investors. To spot potential credit problems quickly and to keep losses per card low, the bank limits credit lines to an average of $1,000, much lower than other major credit card issuers such as Citibank and Chase Manhattan.    And Banc One has been expanding into nonbanking computerized services that generate fee income, providing more stability and higher growth potential than volatile interest income.    Already, some banking executives consider Banc One a data-processing powerhouse. In addition to the 3.2 million credit cards it processes for itself, the company handles 3.5 million cards for third parties such as credit unions and savings associations. It also provides check-clearing and other &quot;back office&quot; accounting services for dozens of smaller banks and several securities firms, including Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    Processing Merrill Lynch's cash management accounts was Banc One's most successful non-banking venture. The accounts allowed Merrill Lynch to compete head-on with commercial banks by permitting customers to tap their margin accounts through the use of a check or special Visa charge card.    That venture has proven profitable -- and controversial. While the venture was pulling in one million new accounts, Banc One was being castigated by fellow bankers who were angry that it had &quot;let Merrill Lynch into our henhouse,&quot; recalls one executive.    The new arrangement with the AARP is again upsetting many in the industry who dislike the idea of a bank helping non-bank institutions offer competing services. However, Banc One sees the arrangement as especially lucrative. It will obtain a fee for each transaction it processes for the AARP, which expects to sign up as many as five million credit union members.    Since the credit union itself will not have branches, members must access their accounts and withdraw cash through automated teller machines. Some industry executives, noting that senior citizens tend to resist electronic banking, say the credit union could sign up fewer people than expected.    Still, the venture gives Banc One valuable marketing information and access to the fastest-growing and wealthiest segment of the U.S. population.    Banc One's willingness to leap into new ventures has produced its share of failures -- about 50% of ventures. They include the home banking systems that Banc One tried to get off the ground with several electronic information systems, including Knight-Ridder Co., Times Mirror Co. and CompuServe.    Banc One also teamed up with International Business Machines Corp. to offer point of sale purchasing (using debt cards to pay for store merchandise). That failed because too few consumers were interested in using it.    But its successes predominate. Since it was formed in 1968 with the merger of City National Bank andamp; Trust Co. and Farmers Bank of Ohio, Banc One has acquired 58 banks and grown to $18.7 billion in assets, making it among the nation's 50 largest banking concerns, from $4.8 billion in assets 10 years ago.    No one symbolizes Banc One's high-energy style better than Mr. McCoy, who seems more the industrialist than bankerat staff meetings discussing product cycles, sizing up potential venture partners, questioning the need for added research and development spending. Banc One sets aside an unusually large amount each year -- 4% of its gross profit -- for Randamp;D, with much of the funds spent to develop new data-processing products the bank sells to retail and commercial customers.    A number-cruncher, Mr. McCoy spends an inordinate amount of time going over minute performance details of his 21 bank subsidiary presidents. But he rarely gets involved in the day-to-day operations of the individual banks. &quot;What he does best is assemble and retain talented managers,&quot; says John Cornwell, a banking analyst at Blunt, Ellis andamp; Loewi Inc. in Milwaukee.    Mr. McCoy tends to seek people outside the industry for top posts that aren't lending-related; his senior vice president of marketing was a former radio advertising executive. &quot;Historically, bankers would simply get someone who wasn't a great credit analyst and make him head of marketing,&quot; contends Roman Gerber, an executive vice president.    The third generation of his family to run the banking concern, Mr. McCoy succeeded his father as president and chief executive in 1984, and added the chairmanship last year. His grandfather ran City National Bank. Like his father and grandfather, Mr. McCoy has sought to be &quot;successful by being different. The market appreciates that we are not dependent 100% on the old-fashioned banking business.&quot;    ---           Banc One: Diversified and Profitable                           IQ 1988    1987    1986   1985 Earnings per share          $2.67*  $1.98   $1.94  $1.75 Net income (in millions)    70.3   208.8   199.8  176.8 Return on average assets  Banc One                    1.53%   1.19%   1.23%  1.23%  Other regional banks         .96%    .79%    .92%   .88% Source of income (in millions)  Net interest income      $234.3  $907.3  $830.4 $719.9  Non-interest income        75.3   284.0   250.7  235.0  Fiduciary activities       12.9    47.9    41.9   36.0  Service charges            17.4    64.8    58.2   52.4  Credit card services       25.6   103.5    89.4   84.5  Other                      19.5    67.8    61.3   61.6   *Analysts' forecast for full year   Source: Company reports, Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
