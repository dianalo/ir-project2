The method is for use in Kuzbass mines, and is based on empiricaldata recorded in roadways in 20 mines (169 km of roadway). These datarevealed that 60% of roadway length was subject to rock movement of lessthan 0.1 m, and 96% to less than 0.5 m. Of the 169 km, 147 km were ina satisfactory state (reliability 0.87). The method involves the plottingof graphs of collected values for the support bearing capacity, stabilitycoefficient and reliability, and rock movement. From these graphs theminimum necessary support bearing strength can be identified. Becauseof the breakdown of roadways into sections with specific mining/geologicalconditions, it is possible to get a picture of the intensity of rockpressure manifestations for different conditions. 4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
