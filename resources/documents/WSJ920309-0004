The bank now sees profits totaling 30 billion yen ($227million), compared with the 90 billion yen figure itprojected in November. Pretax profits, meanwhile, are nowexpected to total 140 billion yen, down from the 190 billionyen it forecast in November when Fuji Bank announced resultsfor the first fiscal half. The bank didn't change its earlierforecast for revenue of 3.8 trillion yen in the year.</LP><TEXT>   In the prior fiscal year, which ended in March 1991, FujiBank reported pretax profit of 205.91 billion yen, net profitof 119.61 billion yen and revenue of 4.132 trillion yen. Ifthe revised predictions prove accurate, Fuji Bank would seefiscal 1991 pretax profit fall by 32% from a year earlier,and net plunge 75%. Revenue would decline 8.0%.   For the prior fiscal year, Fuji Bank reported a decline inpretax profit of 31% from the year before, and a 19% declinein net. Revenue climbed by 15%.   A spokesman said the bank lowered its projections becauseit decided to add about 100 billion yen to a taxable reserveaccount for protection against bad loans. In particular, thereserves will likely be needed because of the forgeddocuments allegedly issued by a former Fuji Bank branchmanager in one of last year's prominent financial scandals.The manager was fired when the bank said he issued fraudulentreceipts for deposits, which associates then used ascollateral to gain financing elsewhere.</TEXT></DOC>
