Fahd had expressed the same view ahead of April's meeting of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, whereministers discussed means of propping up the flagging oil pricesaround an $18-a-barrel benchmark.   Six non-OPEC oil producers earlier had proposed a 5 percent cutin output by oil producers inside and outside the cartel, a demandbacked by Iran. But it was rejected by Saudi Arabia and other Gulfcountries within OPEC, and the meeting ended inconclusively.   The issue will be taken up again when the cartel convenes againon June 8 in Vienna.   Saudi Arabia is the leading OPEC member state, and sits on morethan a quarter of the world's oil proven reserves.   Separately, a report issued by the Saudi Arabian MonetaryAgency, the kingdom's equivalent of a central bank, showed the oilsector's contribution to the gross national product had droppedfrom 55 percent a decade ago to 30 percent last year.   The report said that this affirmed the success of the kingdom'sefforts to diversify its economy away from dependence on crude oilexports.   The private sector's share in the GNP rose from 30 percent 10years ago to 49 percent in 1987, while non-petroleum exportsincreased from $31.5 million to $2.1 billion in 1987, the reportsaid.   Dependence on imports dropped from 70 percent of total demand 10years ago to 43 percent last year, it said.   The main Saudi exports are petrochemicals, but the kingdom alsois developing an agricultural base and has begun exporting produceto other countries.   The report said petrochemicals contributed 11 percent to GNP andagriculture 7 percent last year, compared with 6.5 percent and 3percent a decade ago, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
