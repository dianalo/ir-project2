(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Questions haunt the relatives of 47 sailorskilled last April in the fiery blast aboard the USS Iowa andalthough the World War II-era warship may retire, the families'nightmares may not end.   ``With most accidents, you have the accident and then it's over.With all the press and the problems related to the investigation,this just doesn't go away,'' said Dale Schelin, whose son,Geoffrey, was one of those killed.   On April 19, 1989, seconds before the Iowa was to fire testshots from its three-gun No. 2 turret, an explosion in the centergun killed all 47 men in the upper turret. Thirteen sailors in theturret's bottom compartment escaped.   The Navy, which plans to mothball the battleship, concluded themost likely cause of the blast was sabotage by gunner's mateClayton Hartwig, who died in the blast. The Navy said Hartwig wassuicidally despondent over a broken friendship with another sailor.   The families, however, doubt the Navy's conclusion. They want toknow more about the age of gunpowder that ignited in the blast offPuerto Rico and about possible malfunctions within the huge gunturret.   ``The gunpowder in the turret was stored in the summer of 1988on barges for 60 days when the temperature exceeded 100 degrees,''said Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina. ``It is supposed to bestored at 70 degrees. The high temperatures cause it todestabilize.''   Autopsy reports indicate the dead sailors were wearing jewelryand watches in the turret that could have caused a spark, Ms.Kubicina said.   ``I have evidence that indicates the gunpowder was starting toturn green,'' Ms. Kubicina said. ``When it turns green, that meansit is starting to destabilize. ... In my brother's autopsy andother ones, it says there were green foreign materials in theirbodies.''   Ms. Kubicina said she has asked the Navy for a chemical analysisof the propellants removed from the bodies, ``but but I've beentold no chemical analysis was don.,''   Sharon Ziegler's husband, Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald OwenZiegler, 39, was the senior enlisted man in the Iowa turret. He waskilled less than four months before he was to retire.   ``It's so hard to believe that men working side-by-side witheach other, depending on each other, that the Navy would pinpointone man,'' she said. ``If they had picked on my husband, I wouldhave fought them just like the Hartwig family.   ``My husband always said there were many things that could gowrong. He always said it all depended on his kids pushing the rightbuttons. Their lives depended on that.''   Tests by Navy experts found residue in the center gun ofmaterial the Navy concluded was a detonating device. Those findingswere not duplicated by FBI experts.   The Navy's report also was criticized by members of Congress andoutside experts, who argue the Navy was looking for a scapegoat andignored other possible causes.   A subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee said theNavy's conclusion were not supported by the facts.   Krieg Brusnahan, a lawyer for the Hartwigs, said any legalaction will be announced on the anniversary of the blast Thursday.``The Navy is not going to get away with trashing of the Hartwigfamily name with its uncorroborated accusations,'' he said.   The future of the Iowa is uncertain. One of four Iowa-classbattleships, the second-largest such ships ever built, the Iowa hasnine 16-inch guns that can hurl projectiles as heavy as VolkswagenBeetles as far as 23 miles.   Launched in August 1942, it is the only warship with a bathtub,which was installed for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Iowawon nine battle stars in World War II and two battle stars in Korea.   Changes in Eastern Europe have Navy officials reconsidering itsusefulness. But former Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr., whobrought the Iowa out of retirement in 1983, said mothballing theship is a mistake.   ``We still need naval power to deter and contain state-sponsoredterrorism,'' Lehman said. ``The battleship, next to the carrier, isthe most effective and important means of deterrent.''   Three months after the explosion, the battleship left on adeployment to the Mediterranean with the damaged gun turret sealed,then returned to its Norfolk base in December.   Today, the Iowa is at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard undergoing $13million in preparations for mothballing.   ``We will hold a private memorial service April 19 for theship's crew and the families of men killed. It's really somethingvery private _ the best way for us to remember our shipmates,''said Lt. Cmdr. Brad Goforth.   A plaque listing the 47 sailors who died, including Hartwig,will be dedicated. The Iowa's commander, Capt. Fred Moosally,called Hartwig ``a good sailor and a good shipmate.''   The families don't want to see the warship in mothballs.   ``She belongs at sea,'' Mrs. Ziegler said. ``There is the prideof all the guys who went to sea on her, who fought on her. That'show she needs to be remembered _ proudly riding the waves. Thatship carries the ghosts of 47 men in her turret.''</TEXT></DOC>
