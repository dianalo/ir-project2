Politicians and union leaders are invoking Germany's economic collapse of the 1920s and 1930s. As jittery capital markets drive up interest rates, West German policy makers are giving domestic monetary stability priority over harmony with the U.S. and other industrial countries. (The Reagan administration has been pressing Germany and Japan to loosen fiscal and monetary controls, not tighten them, in the hope of stimulating demand for imports and narrowing the U.S. trade deficit.)    The result is increasing pressure on West Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, to tighten the money supply. And the Bundesbank has been doing just that with three successive rises in its key open-market interest rate. Some economists predict more increases this year.    What's all the excitement about? West Germany's inflation rate is well under 1%, its economy certainly isn't overheating and comfortably low import prices don't appear to be threatened by a sudden drop in the mark. In September, West Germany's consumer price index was up only 0.4% from a year ago and was actually down 0.2% from the preceding month.    What worries West Germans is that continued strong growth in the money supply implies an inflationary trend. The Bundesbank's primary indicator of monetary growth rose at a 7.4% annual rate in August, well over the 3%-to-6% growth target for 1987 that the Bundesbank had pledged last December to enforce.    &quot;The rapid increase in central bank money stock has led to fears among the more hard-line monetarists that inflationary pressures are being built up within the economy,&quot; said Mushtaq Shah, an economist for Phillips andamp; Drew in London.    Growing pressure to nip inflation in the bud poses a dilemma for Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, whose restrictive interest-rate policy contradicts calls by West Germany's major trading partners for Bonn to stimulate economic growth for the good of world trade.    Mr. Poehl has built a reputation as a monetary pragmatist, willing to forge West German monetary policy in cooperation with other leading industrial countries. But Mr. Poehl can be only as accommodating as the majority of his central bank council will let him.    Last spring, for instance, Mr. Poehl was able to steer an expansive course with West Germany's monetary policy. He convinced monetarists that Germany's money supply would begin to sink back into its assigned range later in the year as currency speculation subsided and as capital left West Germany for higher-yielding investments elsewhere.    It didn't work. Mr. Poehl is now facing increasing opposition from the hard-liners on his board. The council consists of Mr. Poehl, five directors, and the mostly conservative presidents of West Germany's 11 regional central banks. Alarmed over creeping inflation, the conservatives pressed for increases in the interest rate on the central bank's one-month securities repurchase agreements, a refinancing facility for banks that has eclipsed the discount rate in importance.    The latest increase came Tuesday when the Bundesbank raised the minimum bidding rate on the repurchase agreements to 3.6% from the minimum rate of 3.5% tendered for the previous transaction two weeks ago. Sources said Mr. Poehl opposed raising the rate but was outvoted. As a result the rate at which funds were paid out yesterday was 3.75%, up from 3.65% two weeks ago and 3.55% in early July.    In public, Mr. Poehl has taken great pains to convey the message abroad that the Bundesbank's rate increase was a temporary measure to stave off inflation rather than waiting for it to arrive. But when explaining the move Tuesday, the central-bank chief gave no clue how long the Bundesbank's anti-inflation policy would be in effect.    Mr. Poehl will face another test before the council in December. Indeed, many economists suspect the Bundesbank's recent spurt of interest-rate increases was meant to reassert its credibility after nearly two years exceeding money-supply targets, while setting up a system of rates that will ensure it doesn't happen again in 1988.    &quot;The recent rate increases show that the closer the Bundesbank gets to that December decision the more nervous it gets,&quot; says Diethard Simmert, a monetary analyst for Commerzbank AG. &quot;Right now the monetarists seem to be in full swing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
