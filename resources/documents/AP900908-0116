Michael S. Dukakis' staff will assess thebudget-cutting proposals unveiled by his rebellious lieutenantgovernor, but some observers said Saturday her plan won't solve thestate's fiscal troubles.   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy seized command as acting governor afterDukakis left the state on a European trade mission, and on Fridayshe issued her own program.   But Dukakis' staff is still carrying out the orders he issuedbefore he left Thursday.   Murphy, needing some life in her lagging campaign for governor,had raised expectations about her proposals by refusing to disclosethem as long as Dukakis was still in Massachusetts. She said shewas waiting for the former Democratic presidential candidate toleave so she could assume authority.   She will face two other opponents in the Sept. 18 Democraticprimary, and public opinion polls put her well behind. Dukakis,whose popularity has dived, is not seeking re-election.   Among Murphy's steps were cutting management positions in eachcabinet secretariat by 25 percent, as well as slashing by 10percent the payroll of the Department of Administration and Finance.   Murphy said her proposals would save up to $150 millionannually. Earlier in the week, Dukakis had ordered cabinetsecretaries to find $150 million worth of cuts for the currentfiscal year.   Dukakis refused to comment on her proposals Saturday. ``I've gota very good team in place (at home) and I want to get on with thistrip,'' he said in Bitterfeld, East Germany.   Dukakis administration officials said Murphy's numbers weremisleading, and that her plan would realistically save only about$17 million this fiscal year.   ``In terms of real dollar savings, it doesn't match up to the$125 million to $150 million which she says it is,'' said StephenCrawford, a Dukakis spokesman.   ``For people looking to an end to this yearlong nightmare, Idon't think we saw it yesterday,'' said James Braude, head of theTax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts, a group that has supportedhigher taxes to help solve the state's fiscal woes.   Crawford said the governor's staff would assess Murphy's plansover the next week. Dukakis is scheduled to return Friday.   Dukakis had said he might cut his trip short if any actionMurphy took threatened to hurt the state's stability. But afterMurphy issued her orders, Crawford said he saw no reason for thegovernor to return early.   He noted that executive orders requiring payroll cuts would nottake effect before Dukakis comes back, since such actions take 10days to implement. Once the governor returns, he can rescindMurphy's action, but Crawford could not predict what action Dukakismight take.   Murphy's orders do not supersede the instructions Dukakis issuedearlier in the week to make cuts, which means cabinet secretarieswill still carry out those plans, Crawford said.   A spokesman for the Executive Office of Human Services said hisagency would proceed with the spending cuts ordered by Dukakis.   ``The secretary's strong position is that he works for MikeDukakis,'' said Kenneth Schwartz, chief of staff for Human ServicesSecretary Philip Johnston.   Mark Longabaugh, a spokesman for the lieutenant governor, saidSaturday that she stands behind her savings projections.   One element of her plan did not receive as much as attention asthe payroll cuts, he said, but was highly important. That orderwould require the department of Administration and Finance tosubmit monthly budget reports, documenting whether the state'sbooks are in balance.   Cabinet secretaries who fail to remedy their deficits could losepart of their salaries and possibly their jobs.   While Murphy has downplayed the political aspects of her action,saying she was simply looking out for the state's well-being,Longabaugh acknowledged her supporters believe the campaign hasgained ground from the episode.   ``From a political standpoint, she looked like a leader, shelooked like she was ready to act,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
