And how many grams does it take to fill you up anyway?   What's a health-conscious consumer to do?   Frank E. Young, who heads the federal agency that regulates thelabels on much of our food, can sympathize. He's a doctor, and evenhe has trouble.   It's hard ``to read labels and figure out what to eat,'' saidYoung, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, whichis responsible for labels on foods not regulated by the U.S.Department of Agriculture. Labels on food, he said, are ``a relic.''   He'd get no argument from consumer groups.   Statements on food packages by law must be true, butmanufacturers may not tell consumers all they want to know. Thatsugar-free snack, for example, or an oat bran muffin with severaltablespoons of fat, at 100 calories a tablespoon.   ``Saturated fat is still not listed, cholesterol is still notlisted, and fiber is still not listed... These are the nutrientsthe surgeon general has told the American public to watch for whenthey go shopping,'' said Bruce Silverglade, director of legalaffairs for the Washington-based consumer advocacy group Center forScience in the Public Interest.   Food processors say the problem is that many consumers aren'tsufficiently informed about ingredients to interpret informationalready on labels.   ``You get into good food-bad food, good ingredient-badingredient, when what you want to look at is your overall diet,''said Allen Matthys, director of regulatory affairs for the NationalFood Processors Association. Its 450 processors favor currentregulations making many nutrition labels voluntary.   ``You can reduce risks by modifying diet,'' Young said. ``Thatmeans you have to give much more information, you have to giveinterpretations of the information.''   The FDA was sidetracked from food label reform by such issues asAIDS and food additives, he said. But labeling will be a dominantissue this year, and the agency is considering new regulations onfiber and cholesterol.   Young wouldn't speculate what those rules might require.   Silverglade agreed that prospects for reform appear better.``What's changed is that several very important reports have beenissued ... advising Americans to modify their diet.''   Among them was Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's report lastsummer that nearly 1.5 million people died in 1987 from diseasesassociated with diet.   Also, consumers ``are becoming increasingly frustrated'' withlabels, Silverglade said. A coalition that includes several medicaland dietary groups, the National Council on the Aging and ConsumerFederation of America is meeting with federal officials to lobbyfor changes this year from the FDA or Congress.   The Center for Science in the Public Interest has proposedlabels with a ``traffic light'' system of colored panels forcalories, fiber, fat and salt. Its proposal would require labelsfor fast foods; percentages of major ingredients in a food; anddisclosure of cholesterol, saturated fat and fiber.   ``Food labels could be one of the greatest measures we couldtake to benefit the health of Americans,'' said Silverglade, notingthe costs in lives and dollars from diet-related disease.   Still, Young said, it likely will be years before consumers seechanges.   The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service approves labelsfor products that contain at least 2 percent poultry or 3 percentmeat. Its standards say, for example, that a product called beefwith gravy must be at least 50 percent beef, while gravy with beefmust be 35 percent beef. It also regulates eggs.   Of the rest of food, regulated by the FDA, only about 55 percenthave nutrition labels. Regulations the FDA adopted in 1973 requirethem only if nutrients are added or if a nutritional benefit claimis made.   All food labels must provide the name of the product; the nameand location of the manufacturer, packer or distributor; and thenet contents or net weight. But not all foods must list even theingredients; the FDA has a ``standard of identity'' for about 300foods _ such as mayonnaise and ketchup _ and doesn't requireingredient lists for products that fit the standard.   There are two issues the FDA must consider:   One is nutrition labels, now on the back or side of packageslisting ingredients in descending order by weight, and per-servingamounts of calories, protein, and certain vitamins and minerals.   The second is health claim labels, which first appeared in 1984,usually on the front of a package.   ``Health claims are claims that talk about the people that eatthe food. Nutrition claims are claims that are made about theproperties of the food,'' said John L. Stanton, professor of foodmarketing research at St. Josephs University in Philadelphia.   ``We really need a strategy that includes both of them,'' Youngsaid. But there is no consensus whether all packaged foods shouldhave labels, what information should be included or how it shouldbe provided.   In the meantime, the FDA has a proposal _ its second such effort_ awaiting Office of Management and Budget approval that wouldregulate health claims.   ``The FDA is taking a cautious approach, limiting labelstatements to things on which there is a consensus, based on thesurgeon general's report,'' said F. Edward Scarbrough, deputydirector of the FDA's Office of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Centerof Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.   Five things would be addressed: fats and heart disease, fats andcancer, fiber and cancer, calcium and osteoporosis, and sodium andhypertension. The FDA would come up with model label statementsthat manufacturers could use, or companies could write their ownwithin certain guidelines.   Young would not even guess whether OMB would act on the proposalthis year, and some consumer groups say there's little chance arule would be adopted.   Silverglade said FDA and OMB are ``caught in a bureaucratictrench warfare over the wording of the rule. OMB is insisting on avery weak rule that will allow manufacturers to write their ownticket and slap practically whatever health claims they choose ontheir product.''   FDA inaction has prompted nine states to start negotiating withfood companies directly, said Steve Gardner, assistant attorneygeneral in Texas. ``We've seen a plethora of pretty outrageousclaims of health benefits. Even with the good products, the basicvenal nature of the companies is such that they can't avoid makingmisleading or untruthful claims.''   In addition, legislation has been submitted to Congress thatwould require disclosure of more information about saturated fatsand establish standards for ``lite'' foods. Currently, ``lite'' or``light,'' except on meats, can mean fewer calories or just alighter color or texture.   Other bills are expected, including one requiring nutritionlabels on all FDA-regulated foods.   Despite a lack of regulation, health claims already appear onmany foods.   Kellogg Co. broke the ice in 1984 when it linked consumption ofAll-Bran cereal with reduction of cancer risks. The label said inpart: ``The National Cancer Institute reports that high-fiber,low-fat diets may reduce some kinds of cancer. All-Bran is ahigh-fiber cereal.''   FDA's options were to declare the cereal a drug and forceKellogg to undergo the lengthy procedures for drug approval, or totry to come up with a regulation that would allow such labels.Seizing All-Bran, Young said, would have been ridiculous. Theagency still is seeking a solution.   Because many consumers are trying to eat better, some officialsfear poorly regulated health claims might do more harm than good.   A food high in fiber might brag about that without owning up toalso being high in salt. ``So you don't have a heart attack,''Gardner said. ``You would have a stroke instead.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for April 6</NOTE></DOC>
