<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-88-0897 </DOCNO><TEXT>The efficiency of thermally and magnetically controlled superconductingrectifiers is analyzed under the conditions imposed by two applications:energizing high-current super-conducting loads and recapturing the lossin a previously energized load by means of demountable current leads.Formulas are derived for determining rectifier heat and current losseswhich can be implemented in their design. The effects of such parametersas primary waveform, primary amplitude, frequency, and fraction of pumpingtime are determined. The formulas are tested in determining the efficiencyof two experimental rectifiers at the University of Twente.</TEXT></DOC>
