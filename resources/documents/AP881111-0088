So say experts on the initiative process as they survey theresults of the 229 statewide issues and hundreds of local questionsthat citizens confronted on Election Day.   ``It's definitely an expression of impatience with the regularpolitical process,'' says David Schmidt, editor of the newsletter``Initiative and Referendum: The Power of the People'' published inSan Francisco _ the city where voters on Tuesday waded through noless than 29 statewide initiatives and 24 local issues.   Of the 229 statewide issues, a record 54 were citizeninitiatives, topping the previous high of 52 in 1982, according toPat McGuigan, an authority on ballot issues at the Washington-basedInstitute for Government and Politics.   Citizen initiatives find their way onto ballots mainly becauseenough people believe they have a problem that they feel legislatorsaren't doing much about _ soaring auto premiums in California, forexample.   But that's not the entire explanation, said McGuigan.   ``There are certainly elements of public disgust. But what you'reseeing now is that well-funded interest groups see this initiativeprocess as a good way to promote their agendas,'' he said.   Such populist lawmaking is possible only in the 26 states plusthe District of Columbia where citizen initiatives are allowed.Those states are mostly in the West and Midwest and the numberhasn't changed significantly in years.   Some of this year's upsurge in initiative activity is simply thenormal pattern of having many more initiatives in even-numberedyears when voter turnout is heaviest. In 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1987,there were six, five, four, and five citizen initiatives on stateballots, respectively. But in 1982, 1984, 1986 and 1988, there were52, 40, 42 and 54.   In the past, environmental activists have forced states to enactbottle bills. The early 1980s saw scores of nuclear freezeinitiatives. Tax rebels have forced states to curb spending,starting with California a decade ago.   State legislative spokesmen don't deny the public's frustrationwith their workings. But William Pound, executive director of theNational Conference of State Legislatures, said that increasingly itis special interests who are turning to the initiative process afterfailing to get their way in the statehouse.   Even so, the failure of big money to sway voters in so manyballot contests this year was extraordinary.   On Tuesday, pro-life groups forced an end to state funding ofabortions in Michigan, Arkansas and Colorado. But trial lawyersspent $15 million in a losing effort to promote an auto insurancereform measure in California; in Florida doctors lost an expensivebattle to limit liability claims for bodily injury to $100,000 fornon-economic losses such as pain and suffering.   Tobacco companies spent some $15 million opposing a 25-cent hikein California's cigarette tax _ and lost.   The National Rifle Association spent upwards of $4 million to getMaryland voters to repeal its new law banning cheap handguns _ andlost also.   California's auto insurance battle was the bitterest and mostexpensive of all.   ``People had a real financial incentive in this,'' said Schmidt.``The legislature couldn't or wouldn't do anything about (risingauto premiums). Trial lawyers fought the insurance lobby to astandoff.''   The result was that Californians decided to tackle the issuethemselves. They chose among five ballot measures, some backed bythe legal community, some by the auto insurers, and one by consumeradvocate Ralph Nader.   As with gun control in Maryland and tort reform in Florida, theside with the least money won the most votes. The Nader-backed issuecutting auto rates by at least 20 percent defeated rival measuresthat insurers and trial lawyers had spent $75 million unsuccessfullypromoting.   Usually, nothing has talked louder or more successfully in theinitiative process than money, says Thomas E. Cronin, a politicalscientist at Colorado College who is finishing a book on theinitiative process.   ``Money plays an important role in almost all aspects of directdemocracy devices,'' Cronin wrote recently. ``Money may not alwaysbe a decisive factor, yet money, especially large amounts of money,well spent can usually defeat ballot questions.''   That citizen action triumphed in 1988 over money in several caseshasn't erased other concerns some have raised about the growth ofthe initiative process.   Some fear initiatives are a vehicle for majorities to tyrannizeminorities. Homosexuals aren't the nation's most popular group, andsure enough, a gay rights measure lost in Oregon on Tuesday.   ``But that happens in legislatures, too,'' said Schmidt. ``I justdon't buy the argument that voters are so much more emotional oranti-minority than legislators.''</TEXT><HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE _ Lee Mitgang has written about ballot issues</HEAD><TEXT>   since 1978.</TEXT></DOC>
