The justication for automatingis not only productivity but also reliability of results. Film remainsin the automated system of the future because of its extremely high imagecontent, approximately 8 x 10/sup 9/ bits per 14 x 17. The equivalentto 2200 computer floppy discs. Parts handling systems and robotics appliedfor manufacturing and some NDT modalities, should now be applied to filmradiographic NDT systems. Automatic film handling can be achieved withthe daylight NDT film handling system. Automatic film processing is becomingthe standard in industry and can be coupled to the daylight system. Robotsoffer the opportunity to automate fully the exposure step. Finally, computeraided interpretation appears on the horizon. A unit which laser scansa 14 x 17 (inch) film in 6 - 8 seconds can digitize film informationfor further manipulation and possible automatic interrogations (computeraided interpretation). The system called FDRS (for Film Digital RadiographySystem) is moving toward 50 micron (*approx* 16 lines/mm) resolution.This is believed to meet the need of the majority of image content needs.We expect the automated system to appear first in parts (modules) ascertain operations are automated. The future will see it all come togetherin an automated film radiographic NDT system</TEXT></DOC>
