Gorbachev should leave the superpowers``better prepared to make substantial progress'' on a treaty toslash long-range nuclear weapons, Secretary of State James A. BakerIII said Wednesday.   However, he emphasized anew that no such agreement would bereached during the two-day meeting.   In a pre-summit news conference at the White House, Baker alsosaid the democratic reforms that are bringing down Eastern Europe'shard-line communist regimes are ``the only path to long-termlegitimacy and stability in the region,'' and he warned against anycrackdown by authorities.   While saying Moscow has not stood in the way of the stunningchanges, Baker declared, ``We firmly believe that any attempts toforcibly intervene and prevent continued reform will be extremelydestabilizing and dangerous.''   He made a clear distinction between ``forcibly suppressingpeaceful dissent'' and intervention by authorities to restoreorder, such as in possible ethnic violence in the Soviet Union.   ``I see those as two distinctly different things,'' Baker said.   The secretary spoke on the eve of the president's departure forthe Mediterranean island of Malta. Bush and Gorbachev will holdtalks Saturday and Sunday on U.S. and Soviet warships anchored inMalta's Marsaxlokk Bay.   In Rome, unidentified Soviet officials quoted in Thursdayeditions of The Washington Post told reporters Gorbachev also wouldfocus on arms questions, with the aim of winning a commitment fromBush for rapid progress on nuclear and conventional armsagreements, including the establishment of a 1990 deadline for atreaty on strategic missiles clear statement   Bush spent Wednesday preparing for his first meeting aspresident with Gorbachev, discussing the talks in a telephoneconversation with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the twoleaders also talked about Kohl's new proposal Tuesday for aconfederation with East Germany as a step toward eventualreunification.   On that point, Baker said, ``If there's unification, it shouldoccur in the context of Germany's continued alignment with NATO andan increasingly integrated European Community.''   He ruled out any ``trade'' with Moscow in which the two Germanyswould be reunited as a neutral government.   Mindful of some reservations among U.S. allies in Europe, Bakersaid he preferred a gradual, step-by-step process of bringing thetwo Germanys together.   Bush also planned to discuss the summit at a dinner withCanadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.   At his news conference, Baker said Bush would complain toGorbachev about what U.S. officials say is a continuing flow ofSoviet-made weapons to the Moscow-backed government of Afghanistan,as well as to leftist rebels in El Salvador through Nicaragua.   ``This pattern is a Cold War relic,'' Baker said.   Noting that Soviet officials have promised to prevent Nicaraguafrom shipping Soviet arms to El Salvador, Baker said, ``Either theNicaraguans are lying to the Soviet Union or the Soviet Union islying to us.   ``We prefer to believe it's the former.''   Baker said the Malta meeting would not be an arms-controlsummit, emphasizing that no agreement would be reached either onlong-range nuclear weapons or reductions in troops and conventionalarms in Europe.   However, he said, ``this meeting should permit us to be in muchbetter shape and much better prepared to make substantial progress,particularly on arms control'' at the full-blown summit schedulednext year in the United States.   U.S. and Soviet leaders have expressed hopes of signing anagreement at that later meeting to cut strategic weapons, thedeadliest arms in the superpowers' arsenals, by as much as 50percent.   This weekend, Baker said, ``they will exchange new ideas butthey're not going to negotiate and they're certainly not going tonegotiate on anything that would involve our allies.''   The secretary also said the two leaders would discuss steps theUnited States might take to improve economic relations with theSoviet Union, such as waiving trade restrictions linked with Sovietemigration and possible Soviet participation in an internationaltrading organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT).   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell proddedBush to waive the trade barriers, known as the Jackson-Vanikamendment.   ``While I welcome the administration's offer to providetechnical advice to the Soviet Union, I believe a more meaningfulresponse is necessary,'' Mitchell told a news conference.   At the White House, Baker hailed warmer ties between Washingtonand Moscow and said, ``We want reforms in Soviet domestic, foreignand defense policy to succeed, and ... we believe that thereformers are for real.''   In an acknowledgement that the changes in Eastern Europe will beaccompanied by hardships for its citizens, Baker said, ``We arequite realistic about the staggering tasks which face thereformers.''   However, he said, the important question for the United Statesis not whether Gorbachev's reforms succeed or fail.   ``The real question is this: Do you engage the Soviet Union in asearch for mutual advantage in this time of uncertainty? And ouranswer to that question is a resounding `yes.'''</TEXT></DOC>
