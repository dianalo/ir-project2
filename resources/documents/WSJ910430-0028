Well-organized and young, the AIDS advocates got thepolitical establishment's attention and support.   On March 15, an FDA advisory committee declined torecommend approval of THA to treat Alzheimer's. THA'spositive effect was first reported by Dr. William Summersfive years ago. Unlike AIDS patients, persons withAlzheimer's are poorly equipped to attract political or mediaattention. We've provided this space to their families tostage their own &quot;demonstration&quot; about the bureaucracy'shandling of THA. A related editorial appears nearby {seerelated editorial: &quot;REVIEW andamp; OUTLOOK (Editorial): The FDA'sWaiting Room&quot; -- WSJ April 30, 1991}.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   THA has benefited my wife for over four years without anyside effects. Our experience with THA as a palliative drughas been outstanding at 200 mg/day taken during the patient's12 waking hours. Now in her 10th year since diagnosis, mywife enjoys her day, is more manageable when on THA, hasattended Adult Day Care three days a week for the past 2.5years, dines out in restaurants two or three times a week,and with assistance as needed enjoys other normal activities.My wife also continues to sleep well at night.   These benefits have continued despite her severe, gradualcognitive failure and increased spatial and physicalproblems. I still care for my wife at home and just recentlyemployed some household help.   In early 1988 the FDA forced Dr. Summers to stop supplyingus with THA for 35 days. My wife became unable to followsimple commands, disruptive, noncooperative, verbally andphysically abusive, and hallucinated. Washing, toiletting,dressing and eating routines became extremely difficult.Nighttimes were a nightmare when she became particularlythreatening or picked up lighted lamps and threw them down.   Such behavior caused me to move out of the bedroom and tomonitor her with an audio system and an infra-red beam todetect when she got out of bed.   Clearly, THA has been of great benefit to my wife and tome as the caregiver. For the FDA to continue to deny somefour million other families normal access to THA, given thedrug's already demonstrated efficacy for a minimum of 40% ofthe patients and a benign toxicity level at 20%, less thanmany other approved drugs, seems to me to be unusually cruel.   On July 1, 1990, Dr. Summers was forced to stop his THAproject. He advised us four months earlier that this wouldprobably take place. After three other occasions of FDAthreats over four years' time to stop the project, inaddition to the previously described 35-day stoppage, Iprepared for the worst and made arrangements to obtain THAfrom other sources at great potential quality risk,inconvenience, and considerable extra cost. It is a sad daywhen an average senior citizen is forced into such a shamefulsituation.   Robert H. Rogge   Chapel Hill, N.C.   ---   In May 1984, my husband, John, was diagnosed at DukeUniversity. He participated in the Lipton Soup/Cholineresearch for three months, drinking two bowls of soup a dayduring the heat of summer. In January 1985 he participated inNimodopine research at Duke. We moved to New Jersey in Apriland he continued on Nimodopine for one year, which requiredmonthly travel to Tarrytown, N.Y., to participate incontinued research.   At the last visit, I was told by a new doctor at theresearch center that all the travel had been in vain: None ofthe tests on my husband were valid because he had eatenbefore each appointment at noon.   We moved to Vermont in 1986. When the FDA/Warner-Lambertresearch was announced, I drove my husband to the Universityof Massachusetts to enroll him. He was rediagnosed as havingPick's Disease, which disqualified him for the research]   I had tried the &quot;legal&quot; way; now I was determined to getTHA for my husband anyway I could. Finally, in 1989, Iordered my first supply of THA. I also found a person tomonitor his liver functions, blood pressure, etc. There wereno side effects.   John was much more spontaneous and alert, could get out ofhis favorite chair without help, was continent again. Hestayed awake in the evenings watching TV, laughing atsitcoms, until bedtime at 11. He slept through the night andwas dry in the mornings. Now in good weather he went in andout of the house and walked around the grounds withoutstraying. His appetite was excellent.   This lasted until the summer of 1990, when THA was nolonger effective. It gave us an extra year to keep John athome with us. He died at the VA Hospital on Oct. 2, 1990,when he was not quite 63.   Patricia A. Baxter   Montpelier, Vt.   ---   I've watched my best friend's mother go from a healthy,loving lady to a vegetable in four years. Thank God, she isnow dead. In two years, my favorite nurse doesn't recognizeme and is filthy. She can't get THA. Lord, please take her.   But, thanks to THA, which I have been able to getoverseas, my mother, Mina Dee, is enjoying life although shehas had Alzheimer's for four years. My mother is living in anassisted-living facility still playing bingo, dancing, goingout shopping and to lunches with the other residents. Shestill visits us every week.   We noticed an improvement within weeks of her first takingTHA.   Peter S. Lang   Clearwater, Fla.   ---   My wife, Glenda, is nearing the age of 77. Ten years ago,it was determined that she was in the latter part of thethird stage of Alzheimer's. Over five years ago, Glenda wasplaced in a protocol approved by FDA in which THA wasadministered.   There have been no negative medical side effects. She eatswell; sleeps well; walks with assistance; follows a designedschedule; and often indicates warmth, love and humor. Sherecognizes me and others of our family, as well as nurses whowork with her regularly. She communicates vividly with facialexpressions, with her eyes, and arm movements. She oftenattempts verbal communication and occasionally uses clearaccurate words. She registers approval and disapproval, joyand sorrow, pain and pleasure. She is still living inmeaningful dignity.   Why not release THA for larger public use throughcarefully selected physicians with the freedom to medicatewithin a scientific research protocol?   Joseph J. Copeland   Gatlinburg, Tenn.   ---   THA has given my mother, Adelia, the means for somemeasure of dignity and independence. I cannot understand whyshe was allowed access to its benefits only to have thisaccess taken away. I cannot understand why most of the fourmillion victims of Alzheimer's Disease have no access at allto THA. And I cannot understand why these millions are anyless deserving than the victims of AIDS, for whom the FDA hasexpedited the approval of new medications with much higherlevels of toxicity.   Michael Antill   San Rafael, Calif.   ---   How could anyone give such a decision when we know howmuch my father improved with THA? Can't the FDA please giveour drowning families a life raft?   Dee Cash   Cartersville, Ga.   ---   My father, Charlie Neely, was a good man who loved hiswife, Willie, and devoted the last years of his life tocaring for her. He would telephone me at least three or fourtimes a day to help reason with my mother. She would bescreaming and crying because she wanted to go home (eventhough she had lived in the same house for 20 years), or tosee her mother (who had been dead for 10 years), or to killmy father (because this sick, aging man was stealing herclothes and passing them out the windows to all hisgirlfriends), or she refused to eat or drink (because he waspoisoning her).   Dr. Summers's program was one last chance instead ofputting my mother in a nursing home. THA did not cure mymother's illness, but she came to my house and made toast] Tous it was a miracle. My mother continued to live at homeuntil her death in 1987.   Shelia N. Crawford   Knoxville, Tenn.   ---   It was with great difficulty that I managed to get myhusband, Frank, into the program Dr. Summers was starting.   It worked, and it worked amazingly well for a long time.One of the most helpful things was that his night wanderingsdecreased. Only someone who has to get up constantly duringthe night, making sure the patient is OK, day after day, canappreciate how much that meant.   Ruth Harris   San Clemente, Calif.   ---   My husband was steadily deteriorating with Alzheimer'suntil February 1990 when we read an ad for a clinic in theBahamas that evaluates patients to see if they would belikely candidates for THA. My husband was accepted.   His neurologist in Florida (who hadn't seen him in threeyears) examined him last week and was utterly amazed in thechange that had occurred. He has never had an adversereaction to THA, but still has liver tests every two months.   Elizabeth C. Davies   Gulfstream, Fla.   ---   After about a month's treatment with THA, Mom wasbeginning to respond. We were all delighted. But after goingback home, Dad could not take care of Mom and maybe sometimeshe would not give proper medication at the proper time. Aftera year of desperation, Dad agreed to put Mom in a nursinghome.   It then became the nursing home's responsibility toadminister the drugs, and the staffers were not doing a goodjob of it. Also, since Mom was in a study, she was given aplacebo. Dad found out and dropped out of the study. We thenpurchased THA elsewhere and achieved some temporaryimprovement. The end result was that, to my disappointment,most everyone directly involved decided the administration ofTHA was an almost impossible task with very minimal results.Mom passed away in September at age 83.   THA, in my opinion, is beneficial when used under properguidance by someone who really cares about the patient andhas the knowledge and patience to persist. THA is only apartially inflated life raft with an unstoppable leak. Is ittherefore a good thing to administer this drug? If thepersons involved are willing to sacrifice time and money toachieve this short-term improvement, then the answer is yes.   Richard L. Landrum   La Grange, Texas   ---   My brilliant husband, Gustave, who had been president of alarge retail chain could not hold a train of thought longenough to complete a conversation, even read a children'sbook to our grandchildren, tie his shoes, choose his ownclothes, or drive.   THA did not restore Gus to normalcy, but he no longerwalked five feet behind me, could cut his own food, feedhimself, recognize me and play limited golf. He again hadhope and would smile and laugh and try]   The FDA allowed us to import THA for our own use. Afterseveral months, it rescinded the permission. Under the guiseof protecting us, the FDA is making a criminal of me.   Marge Handly   Knoxville, Tenn.   ---   I write with great reluctance. There is nothing thisletter can accomplish for myself or for my father, CharlesH., who was an Alzheimer patient for about 10 years until hisdeath last winter.   One must wonder why the FDA so stubbornly and stupidlyclings to its claim that the safety and efficacy of THA havenot been proven. The FDA's absorption with the &quot;clinicaltrial&quot; would be ludicrous if it were not so tragic. It isunforgiveable that their multi-center trial should beconducted in such secrecy and that no trial but their own bepermitted here.   The majority of the research community's sycophanticacquiescence to the FDA's intimidation is disgusting.   Charles M. Greene   Tequesta, Fla.   ---   My wife, Joyce, has had Alzheimer's Disease for severalyears now. She has been on THA since September 1987. If wedid not have it, she would be in a nursing home or havepassed on to the maker.   I first found out about THA through a radio broadcaststating there was a pharmacist filling a doctor'sprescription for THA. This was later stopped by the FDA, andthen a Canadian company began to fill prescriptions. The FDAfirst allowed this. Later, it changed its mind. From then on,I had to get THA from sources not permitted by law. (That iswhy I am using a pseudonym.) My wife is able to go on tripswith me to the Caribbean and enjoys it very much. Without theTHA she does not know anything, as happens when we run out ofthe medication every once in a while.   Carl Peterson   ---   After much effort, I was able to obtain THA from Canadauntil the FDA forbade importation. Certainly, THA's benefitsfar outweigh any risks. It is very difficult to understandthe FDA's lack of compassion for the victims of Alzheimer'sDisease and their families.   Madeline Pritchard   White Lake, N.Y.   ---   My wife, Lucille, was the first person to receive THAorally. She first tried THA intravenously back in May 1982under Dr. Summers, and the change was miraculous. I startedimmediately trying to get the FDA to allow Dr. Summers togive THA orally. It took two years of fighting the FDA withthe help of President Reagan to get a compassionate IND forLucille to receive THA. Within a few months she was able todrive the car, cook and do housework again.   When she was given a placebo unbeknownst to me, I calledDr. Summers to tell him that the THA was not working. He toldme to continue giving Lucille 100 mg of the THA, as this washer beginning dosage. Within a month she improved again.Lucille was on THA for 5 1/2 years, and was receiving up to175mg of THA per day, along with lecithin. She showed notoxicity of the liver. The lecithin makes more acetylcholine,the enzyme that carries the message from one nerve cell toanother.   At the end the THA was not doing much good. Lucille hashad symptoms of Alzheimer's for around 19 years. She's beenin a nursing home for the past 18 months and is only onsedatives now.   George D. Rehnquist   Knoxville, Tenn.   ---   After my wife underwent two unsuccessful experimentalprograms, a respectable medical source gave me a contact forpurchase of THA, albeit illegally, and at an exorbitantprice. My wife has been taking six 25mg capsules daily sinceNovember.   Although there have been no miraculous results, she ismore alert, cheerful and responsive than before. I have herblood tested monthly, and thus far there have been no adversechanges.   Lloyd J. Ryman   Sugar Land, Texas   ---   Picture a very energetic graduate of West Point, S. ThomasScarborough, a nationally known and awarded optometrist whoat the age of 57 started showing signs of memory loss andconfusion. I was taken aside and told to prepare myself forwatching my father turn into a vegetable. Then we discoveredTHA. For the first year my father was on THA, he was able tofunction as a normal individual, doing everything a healthymiddle-aged man should be able to do.   He then went on the NIH program and rapidly showedphysical and mental deterioration. After six months, I wastotally convinced it was a mistake to have taken him off theTHA and put him back on. He never regained all the functionshe had lost but could take up some of the hobbies he had donebefore, such as golf, going to parties and cultural events,and carrying on intellectual and intelligible conversations.   After about five years of being on THA, my father showed arapid decline and then died. I feel very fortunate that ofall those years he had Alzheimer's, most of them were qualityones because of the THA.   Vivian Scarborough   Sullivan Island, S.C.   ---   In a project supervised by Adm. Hyman Rickover, BernardSchwartz developed ceramic material for the nuclearsubmarine. He headed the teams that created the processes formanufacturing multilayer ceramic capacitors and multilayerinterconnection modules that form the basis for computerindustry technology.   Today, Bernie can be seen on the Pace University campus,accompanying me as I hurry to teach my classes. Students knowhim as the gentle man sitting quietly in the back of theroom. They do not know that he is almost incapable of speech,is often incontinent and has difficulty swallowing.   Nor do they realize that the FDA has denied my husbandTHA. We tried THA -- but had to get it in a clandestinefashion. We couldn't get &quot;measured doses,&quot; and the drug wasso expensive. I fervently wish that we could obtain measureddoses of THA openly and legally.   Bernice E. Schwartz   Hartsdale, N.Y.   ---   My husband, Marshall, died June 25, 1988. With Dr. Summersand THA our life was almost as it had been since we weremarried in 1940. If I were demonstrating against the FDA, Iwould throw rocks even though I am not a violent person.   Mae Stern   Knoxville, Tenn.   ---   Get off your butt] Get on the fast track and release THAfor Alzheimer's patients as you released AZT for AIDS.   My wife died of Alzheimer's on Jan. 21. She had it for sixyears. After she was diagnosed, I waited six months to gether into Dr. Summers's program.   Before she was on THA she scored six to 10 on the60-question memory test. After being on THA for only twoweeks she was scoring from 25 to 32. THA kept her fairlystable for three years. She enjoyed life and travel with ourtwo travel-trailer groups.   THA gave my wife three fairly good years beforeAlzheimer's gained the upper hand and I finally had to placeher in a nursing home in July 1990.   People with Alzheimer's are sentenced and on death row.Help them, FDA, while medical science searches for a cure.   O.A. Vaniman   LaVerne, Calif.   ---   There are millions of Alzheimer's victims in this country.But the FDA continues to thwart free access to THA.   My own experiences with THA have been rewarding. My wife,Jane, ill for 10 years with Alzheimer's before coming to Dr.Summers, could neither walk nor talk. She choked on her food,aspirating it into her lungs. She failed to recognize me.Within three weeks on 200 mgs of THA, she could walk. Shestopped choking, stopped aspirating, could recognize me from90 feet and lift her face to be kissed, smiling all the time.She had an extra three years of a quality of life worthliving.   Most families are willing to go to any lengths just tohave closure -- to say once again to their loved ones &quot;I loveyou&quot; and to have them understand, to smile and respond &quot;Ilove you, too.&quot;   Will the FDA ever stop trying to establish a risk-freesociety among the terminally ill?   Woodrow Wirsig   Palm City, Fla.   ---   My beautiful, warm, intelligent wife was diagnosed as aprobable Alzheimer's victim in 1986. Jan was 53 years old.   She had been turned down for three other medicationstudies (two because she was too young; one because she hadonce had cancer). Through a roundabout source, I was able toget some THA. Her thinking was clearer, her personality waslivelier, and she showed no serious side effects. Because Ihad given up a job to care for her, however, my incomecouldn't support continuing to buy a nonapproved medicationnot covered by health insurance.   I love Jan very deeply, and the FDA's decision means thatlove is the only thing I can give her. Love is not enough.   Martin A. Makela   Waconia, Minn.</TEXT></DOC>
