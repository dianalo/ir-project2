The official, an aide to Interior Minister Abdullah Rassi, saidthe 55-year-old businessman was freed at midnight in west Beirut'sVerdun neighborhood, outside the minister's home.   The aide demanded anonymity.   It was not clear why the captors chose to free him there,despite earlier statements saying he would be released at theseaside Beaurivage Hotel, close to the command headquarters of theSyrian army's peacekeeping contingent in west Beirut.   In their third and final statement delivered Monday, handwrittenin Arabic, the captors threatened to delay the release unless theambassadors, Ahmed Dastemeljian of Iran and Wolfgang Gottelmann ofGermany, and an unspecified Syrian official showed up by a 9 p.m.deadline at the hotel.   That statement was accompanied by a polaroid photograph of thecaptive to prove its authenticity.   Gottelmann arrived an hour later. After a 20-minute stay at thehotel, he was whisked away by Syrian escorts and driven in hisbullet-proof Mercedes car to an undisclosed destination.   Beirut's An-Nahar newspaper on Monday published a letter fromCordes that it said was delivered to its west Beirut offices atdawn today along with a statement signed by the Holy Warriors forFreedom. A second statement signed by the same group was deliveredlate Monday afternoon.   The third and last statement, delivered to a Western newsagency, said Iran and President Hafez Assad of Syria haveguaranteed the problem of Mohammed Ali Hamadi and his brother,Abbas, who are jailed in West Germany, will be resolved.   The second statement said the decision to release Cordes ``doesnot in any way mean the abandonment of Mujahed (holy warrior)Mohammed Hamadi.   ``He remains in our heart and mind. But we will take legal andjudicial ways to release him. If these fail, then we shall beobliged to again resort to violence,'' the statement said.   The letter attributed to Cordes said: ``To the government of theFederal Republic of Germany, I am to be released on Monday.   ``Please inform my family, but please do everything regardingMohammed. Please help. The hostage-takers expect something,especially now that I am freed.''   Mohammed Ali Hamadi is being tried in Frankfurt, on murder andair piracy charges in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner duringwhich U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed. Hamadi hasacknowledged taking part in the hijacking, but says an accomplicekilled Stethem.   Hamadi's brother, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, is believed to head theHoly Warriors for Freedom, which claimed responsibility for theJan. 17, 1987 kidnapping of Cordes, 55, Beirut manager for HoechstAG, one of West Germany's largest chemical companies.   Abdul-Hadi is Beirut chief of the security apparatus of theIranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to bean umbrella group for Shiite factions holding foreign hostages inLebanon.   Mohammed Ali Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in 1987after explosives were found in his luggage. Another brother, Abbas,was convicted by a West German court in April of complicity in thekidnappings of Cordes and West German engineer Alfred Schmidt in abid to free Mohammed.   Abbas was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Schmidt was releasedlast September in what the Holy Warriors for Freedom called agoodwill gesture.   Seventeen foreigners are missing and believed kidnapped inLebanon. The hostage held the longest is Associated Presscorrespondent Terry Anderson, who was abducted March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
