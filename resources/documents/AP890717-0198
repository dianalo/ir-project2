It quoted Rafsanjani, Iran's Parliament speaker, as saying in aninterview with the radical Jomhuri Islami daily published Sundaythat Iran should intensify exploitation of its gas reserves ``as thebest and richest sources of energy.''   This should be a key part of Iran's post-war reconstructionprogram, he said.   Iran has natural gas reserves estimated at 700 trillion cubicfeet, the second largest reserves in the world after the SovietUnion. But these have been largely left untapped.   Building up gas as a major export and energy source most likelywould involve major foreign financial and technological assistance,indicating that Rafsanjani could be planning to revive his effortsto rebuild Iran's links with the West.   His moves to end Iran's isolation suffered a setback in Februarywith a radical resurgence triggered by British writer SalamRushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' which the late AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini charged blasphemed Islam.   With Khomeini's death June 3 and the ascendance of Rafsanjani'sso-called pragmatists, the prospect of renewed moves to patch updifferences with the West has emerged again.   The newspaper apparently did not elaborate on Rafsanjani'sremarks regarding gas.   But Western and Iranian economic analysts have noted in recentmonths that Iran's leaders must make decisions soon on a majorrestructuring of the economy to take the country into the 21stcentury.   The most crucial decision, they say, is whether Iran willcontinue to base its economy on the long-term value of its oil withcostly investment, or focus on gas, which energy specialists believewill be in more global demand than oil in the decades to come.   Iran has rebuilt much of its oil industry, which was badlydamaged in the eight-year war with Iraq, and is seeking to developnew fields.   But because of aging equipment and high production costs, Iran'scurrent oil output is about 3 million barrels a day, and experts sayit cannot produce any more than that economically. This makes Iranprey to price fluctuations since it cannot compensate for pricedrops by boosting output.   Some industry specialists estimate that for every $1 drop in theprice of a barrel of oil, Iran's revenue from oil exports tumbles by$2 billion a year.   Oil provides 90 percent of Iran's foreign exchange earnings.   Rafsanjani noted in the interview that the Iranian economy is inpoor shape.   He confirmed estimates by analysts that industry is running atonly 30 percent to 40 percent of capacity ``due to a shortage ofmaterials, energy and parts,'' and that there has been massive wasteof resources in the first decade of the Islamic revolution.   Most analysts agree that the Iranian leadership must move fast oneconomic strategy.   Before the revolution, Iran could feed itself. Now because ofpoor economic management, failure to carry out land redistributionfollowing the revolution and an urban drift away from rural areas,the country has a food import bill that runs $2 billion to $3billion a year.    </TEXT></DOC>
