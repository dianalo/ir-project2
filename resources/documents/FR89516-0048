FERC Contact: Brian Romanek, (202) 376-9042.j. Comment Date: June 20, 1989.k. Description of Project: The Pennsylvania Electric Power Company (PENELEC),licensee for the Deep Creek Lake Project, proposes to amend its recreationplan for the subject project. The proposed amendment was initiated by theMaryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) because the DNR, througha 1980 Settlement Amendment, acquired limited management responsibilitiesto control recreational use of the lake and its buffer zone area. As acondition of the Settlement Agreement, the DNR agreed to formulate a lakezoning plan and to implement the recreation plan for the project. The DNRintends to fulfill its agreement but requests authorization to modify therecreation plan by adding and deleting certain items. The DNR proposesto: (1) Develop a public access site at the southside of the route 219bridge where it crosses the lake. The site would provide parking for 15cars and a connecting pathway to the fishing area; (2) make several improvementsto the State Park that include relocating beach area No. 3 to a betterlocation within the park, construct two handicapped fishing piers withpaved pathway access, and construct an additional boat ramp and parkingfacilities next to the existing ramp at the park; (3) provide additionalsigns at all public access areas to the lake; (4) to deed the unimprovedrecreational sites A and B (identified in the approved recreation plan)to the PENELEC to be reserved for future development; and (5) to issueuse permits (for such facilities as boat docks) to property owners adjacentto sites A and B, provided the use does not interfere with future recreationalopportunities at the sites.The DNR has also prepared a zoning plan to better control the increasingrecreational use of the lake and its shoreline. The proposed controls setforth in the plan were derived from the results of a recently conductedcarrying capacity study at the lake. The plan, as currently proposed, wouldbe implemented by DNR, after FERC approval and the promulgation of Stateregulations. DNR is in the process of developing these regulations andwould implement them following the appropriate State procedures, that includespublic hearings.Within the constraints of PENELEC's license, onsite enforcement of thelake zoning plan would be accomplished by the DNR.l.
