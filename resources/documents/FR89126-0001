In addition, this action doesnot involve any of the designated categories for ``reserved nonmajor''actions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940, SubpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' FmHA has determined that this action doesnot constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the qualityof the human environment and in accordance with the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-190, an Environmental Impact Statement isnot required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder numbers 10.405, 10.411, 10.415 and 10.427 and is subject to the provisionsof Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultationwith State and local officials (7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, 48 FR 29112,June 24, 1983).<ITAG tagnum="84">General Information</ITAG>1. Before passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, RRH borrowers were ableto report operating ``losses'' on their investment in RRH projects dueprimarily to accelerated depreciation and mortgage interest paid on suchproperties. Such ``losses'' could legitimately be applied against otherincome for individual income tax purposes. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 replacesthis type incentive with tax credits. Section 515(p) of the Housing Actof 1949 has been amended to reflect the provisions of the Tax Reform Actof 1986. This amendment to the regulation implements the amendment to theHousing Act of 1986 setting forth conditions regarding renting of the projectunder which borrowers may qualify for the tax credit without undue penaltiescaused by FmHA occupancy requirements. This amendment further providessafeguards for higher income tenants who may be displaced by the borrower'selection to receive tax credit. Finally, this amendment will not affectprojects not receiving tax credit consideration and will not materiallyaffect existing tenant selection criteria.2. In administering the rental assistance (RA) program, the FmHA has experiencedtwo concerns. First there has been limited RA appropriation to meet thetotal RA need nationwide. Second, in some instances a few projects havenot needed or utilized their full RA allotment on a sustained basis. Thischange will permit the FmHA to transfer sustained unused portions of RAallocations to other projects, as provided for in the rental assistanceagreement, Form FmHA 1944-27, to fully utilize available RA funds. Suchdecisions would be appealable by the borrower.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Administrator, Farmers Home Administration, (FmHA) USDA, has determinedthat this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. It provides direction to rural rental housingborrowers receiving tax credits with regard to tenant selection, establishesauthority for the FmHA State Director to transfer unused rental assistanceand informs FmHA staff of their responsibilities with respect to the aforementionedchanges.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>On June 8, 1988, FmHA published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 21460) a proposed rule giving interestedparties until August 8, 1988, to submit comments. A total of five commentswere received in response to the proposed rule. Three comments were fromthe public sector and the other two were from FmHA field office staff.All commentors expressed opposition to the tax credit provisions in generaland to the provision regarding the six-month vacancy period before rentingto other eligible tenants in particular. While the opposition is understoodby the Agency, the inclusion of these provisions is statutory and not justan administrative requirement.Two commentors suggested ``* * * threat to financial viability * * *''should be defined and they stated their opposition to leaving the decisionon this matter to the discretion of the FmHA District Director (D.D.).The Agency agrees and has responded to this expressed concern by includingin the regulatory language a description of financial conditions in a projectthat defines ``* * * threat to financial viability * * *''.One commentor suggested that any action taken by the D.D. to require occupancyby tax credit-ineligibles should be covered by the appeals process as providedby FmHA Instruction 1900-B. The Agency agrees and an amendment in the regulationpertaining to those units under tax credits will reflect this.One commentor suggested that before transferring RA, the project shouldbe operating, at least, at a break-even cash-flow position for six monthsand the project should have a waiting list showing the ability of the projectto maintain a stable financial position. The Agency does not believe thatthis is a valid argument. It is not the intent of the Agency to involuntarilytransfer RA from a project which clearly <T3>needs </T3>the RA already assigned to that project. The intent is totransfer RA from those projects where it is <T3>not </T3>needed, specifically where the owner has demonstrated a lackof eligible tenants and/or applicants who need it.One commentor suggested that at least five RA units remain unused beforeFmHA considers a transfer. The Agency believes that a threshold of five(5) unused RA units is too high because of the large number of projectsthat have less than five (5) rental assistance units, yet are not usingpart of those units. The Agency addressed this issue by changing the regulationto provide that the State Director may transfer the number of unused, minusat least one. This will provide some degree of flexibility.One commentor suggested that upon transfer of units from a project, theowner should have the first choice of reassignment of the units to oneof that owner's other projects, the second choice to the discretion ofthe District Office in which the units are located, then to the State Office,etc. The existing regulation authorizes the State Director to decide whereany transferred units are to be reassigned to meet the greatest need. TheAgency believes that this policy should not be changed.Finally, the two FmHA employees expressed their belief that unused RA shouldbe transferred regardless of whether the RA agreement is on Form FmHA 1944-27or otherwise. While the Agency fully understands this line of thought,this is not legally defensible since earlier versions of the RA agreementcontained specific language which would not permit the Agency to carryout this action.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1930</ITAG>Accounting, Administrative practice and procedure, Grant programs_Housingand Community Development, Loan programs_Housing and Community Development,Low- and moderate-income housing_Rental, Reporting requirements.Accordingly, Chapter XVIII, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations, is amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1930_GENERAL</ITAG>1.
