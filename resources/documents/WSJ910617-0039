National City Corp., a bank holding company based here,disclosed three weeks ago that it has made two unsolicitedbids to buy its crosstown rival in a stock transaction valuedat $870 million. Ameritrust, which is trying to reverse lastyear's bleak performance, has been steadfastly silent. Now adetermined National City soon may be forced to take a moreaggressive approach.</LP><TEXT>   National City Chairman Edward B. Brandon says he has nocurrent plans to either sweeten the offer or make a hostilebid. That approach, he notes, would trigger a shareholderrights' plan, which would increase the purchase price, andshield National City from reviewing Ameritrust's books in thethe due-diligence process.   Nonetheless, Mr. Brandon is clearly growing impatient.&quot;I'm disappointed we haven't yet heard from the Ameritrustboard, and as time goes by, that disappointment increases,&quot;the chief executive says.   National City has in its arsenal one of the nation's topguns in bank mergers. The merger specialist, H. Rodgin Cohen,is a New York lawyer who was considered the driving force inBank of New York's hostile takeover of Irving Bank in 1988.Mr. Cohen knows Ameritrust well. He represented Alfred Lernerin 1987 when the Cleveland investor tried to take control ofAmeritrust.   Observers contend that National City doesn't want to loseAmeritrust to a regional rival, which could make quickinroads into the lucrative northern Ohio market. Pride isalso at stake: National City, after touting the merger as aboon to Cleveland, doesn't want to be stood up at the altarby a bank less than half its size.   Meanwhile, a number of other banks, including oneout-of-state, are said to be positioning themselves to maketheir own bids for Ameritrust, which despite recent loanlosses has a formidable retail franchise in northern Ohio anda much-envied trust department. In addition, Ameritrust issearching for a new chief executive and has seen a number ofhigh-ranking executives leave, so buying the bank now wouldnot create the usual problems in merging two top managements.   Bank analysts doubt a hostile takeover will occur butinstead think a sweetened offer is more likely. &quot;If Nat Cityreally wants Ameritrust -- and all indications suggest thatthey do -- they may find they have to sweeten the offer tosit down and talk,&quot; says Ray Archibold, a bank analyst atFox-Pitt Kelton Inc.   While the battle for Ameritrust will likely take months toplay out, it's already demonstrated how dicey intra-marketbank consolidations can be. Such marriages can drive downcosts and wring out excess capacity, but the banks themselvesmay resist the mergers because of ego or civic pride, or thesheer aversion of embracing a longtime competitor.   National City first approached the Ameritrust board with aprivate offer in September, then followed up with a secondletter on May 2. Under the terms of the proposal, NationalCity would exchange 0.66 share of its stock for each share ofAmeritrust common, or an estimated value of $24 a share. Innational over-the-counter trading Friday, Ameritrust closedat $21, up 25 cents. That's up from the low teens in March,when takeover rumors began spreading. In late trading Fridayon the New York Stock Exchange, National City closed at$37.125, up 37.5 cents.   Mr. Brandon's hunger for Ameritrust is understandable. Theproposed merger would create the nation's 17th-largest bankholding company, with $40 billion in assets, and combine twoof the top three banks in the Cleveland area as measured bydeposits. (Mr. Brandon says the merger would pass antitrustmuster.)   National City, which has been a consistent money makerdespite loan problems of its own last year, estimates thatthe combined banks would save $125 million in annual costs byconsolidating operations. The move would also keep Detroit'sNBD Bancorp out of northern Ohio. NBD entered central Ohiolast year and has said it wants to expand, though it won'tcomment on Ameritrust.   So far the Ameritrust board, which meets Wednesday, hasshown no inclination to sell the bank. For one thing,insiders say the directors are betting that Ameritrust canreverse its decline, driving up the price of National City'sbid or perhaps future bids. Last year the bank lost $96.4million, largely from bad real estate loans and highlyleveraged transactions, but it posted a modest first-quarterprofit of $11 million.   Some board members and top management are said to want tokeep Ameritrust independent. Merging the bank, particularlywith National City, would mean job losses and branchclosings, and cast doubt upon the completion of theAmeritrust Center, a proposed 60-story headquarters thatwould include a Hyatt Regency Hotel.   In addition, sources say interim Chairman Craig R. Smith,a former machine tool executive, doesn't want to beremembered as the man who oversaw the dissolution of a97-year-old institution with strong civic ties.   Another option for Ameritrust is to look for a whiteknight. NBD is one possibility. So are Banc One Corp.,Columbus, Ohio, which has had difficulties expanding inCleveland, and Society Corp., another large Cleveland bankholding company that may fear getting left in the dust if itstwo main competitors consolidate. Banc One and Societydeclined to comment.</TEXT></DOC>
