The aim has been to study if it is possibleto detect by seismic tomography major fracture zones and determine theirdimensions and orientation. The analysis was based on both compressional(P) and transversal (S) waves. The Young's modulus has been also calculatedfor a sub-set of measurements as a cross check for the P and S wave velocities.The experimental data was collected at the crosshole site in the Stripamine during 1984-1985. A down-the-hole impact source was used togetherwith triaxial detectors and a digital seismograph. Five tomographic sectionswere obtained. The number of records per section was appr. 250. Measurementswere done down to 200 m depth in all boreholes. The main conclusion isthat it is possible to detect major fracture zones by seismic tomography.Their position and orientation can also be estimated.</TEXT></DOC>
