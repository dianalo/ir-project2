Carr, deputy assistantsecretary of State for information services.andM;&quot;Resources both monetary and human, are a key problem.andP;  Obviously we aregoing to re-examine our priorities very closely.&quot;andM;Russell S. Rice, NASA's deputy assistant associate administrator for IRMpolicy and systems, said the same thing.andM;&quot;It's going to be a tough budget year with the sequestration and a potentialGramm-Rudman-Hollings cut in our agency's budget,&quot; Rice said.andP;  &quot;To us in IRM,this means we will have to look even more closely at the cost and benefitsassociated with proposed IRM activities.&quot;andM;Rice mentioned a familiar Catch 22: Although agencies depend on IRM to reducetheir manpower needs, the budget constraints that justify automation alsolimit the resources available for ADP equipment and software.andP;  Withoutfunding, agencies cannot afford much automation.andP;  Without automation,agencies cannot save much money.andM;&quot;It's  difficult to start up new systems that require up-front funding beforethe benefits accrue,&quot; Rice said.andP;  &quot;And it's difficult to make those kind ofstrategic investments during tight budgets.&quot;andM;Many of those interviewed said ADP programs will be funded only if theyproduce major savings fast.andM;&quot;In many government calculations, you have to deal with [costs and benefitsin] a single fiscal year,&quot; Carr said.andM;&quot;That doesn't mean you don't make investments that promise savings in outyears.andP;  But in a period of fiscal restraint, there are things you just can'tdo, even though they will save a little money 2-1/2 years from now.andP;  Thesavings and the impacts have to be major.andP;  That's how we identify ourhigh-priority projects.&quot;andM;Paul Wohlleben, director of the Environmental Protection Agency'sAdministrative Systems Division, said agencies often invest in IRM only afterfunding other programs.andP;  &quot;When the base programs are covered, you look tomake improvements through information technology,&quot; he said.andM;Managers now must decide whether to invest scarce funds into new programs orto rely on proven but old systems.andP;  The State Department for example, islooking at dropping some of its older programs that have run their course,Carr said.andM;&quot;It's normal when you add new programs, you very often have to shavesomething off the back to get it all done,&quot; he said.andM;The Army, on the other hand, will focus on maintaining existing systems.andM;&quot;IRM managers will have to make some tough decisions,&quot; said servicespokeswoman Paige Eversole.andP;  &quot;The Army will no longer be able to stretch outprocurements and modernization programs.andP;  In terms of investment, the firstpriority will go toward maintaining existing baseline services.&quot;andM;Col.andP;  Dennis R. Shaw, head of Marine Corps IRM, said the Corps is respondingto funding problems by rethinking its entire IRM support structure for the1990s.andP;  In November, Corps IRM managers met, with high-level officials inQuantico, Va., to discuss options for the future.andM;To save money, the Corps may eliminate some of its processing centers orconsolidate software design activities, Shaw said.andP;  Officials also discussedusing automation to control applications processing remotely at regionalcenters and to manage networks, he said.andM;&quot;These are things we need to look at,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;By taking these approaches,we can hopefully still provide the same level of service with fewer peopleand fewer dollars.&quot;andM;State and EPA will look to image processing to save time, money and space.andO;This year, EPA officials will field their first image processing systems andplans to incorporate the optical disk technology into the agency's businessmethods, Wohlleben said.andM;Carr said State will study this year how imaging systems can help the agencysave money and whether the technology is affordable.andP;  &quot;Fortunately, studiesdon't cost a lot of money,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;You can at least think about doingthings with technology even if you're broke.&quot;andM;This year also will see an increased effort on behalf of many agencies toshare data with each other and perhaps other governments.andP;  For example,Wohlleben said EPA will participate in the development of standards forsharing geographical information with agencies such as the U.S.andP;  GeologicalSurvey and the Census Bureau.andM;He said he expects the agency to work with other nations in the same manner.andM;&quot;Our administrator has been to Europe numerous times speaking about thesethings,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;They talk about what can be done to look at environmentalproblems more globally, and a lot of that has to do with sharinginformation.&quot;andM;But NASA's Rice has another view on what should happen with informationsharing this year.andP;  Rice said he would like to see the government establishregulations that could limit access to scientific and technical data.andM;This information &quot;has unique characteristics that require special handlingwhen dealing with issues such as freedom of information, public access andtransfer of technology,&quot; Rice said.andP;  &quot;This is technology paid for by the U.S.andO;government, and we want to make sure it is disseminated appropriately.&quot;andM;Rice said he hopes 1990 will be the year that laws governing IRM begin todeal with the special requirements of scientific data systems.andP;  &quot;Laws orregulations dealing with IRM have to take into account it is a complex,heterogeneous world with more than one kind of information,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
