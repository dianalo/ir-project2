Psychologists say this happens because fast-trackers arepsychologically out of sync with older peers. &quot;They'rebright, clever and creative, but they often lack the breadthof experience in dealing with people that makes them wise,&quot;says Kenneth Settel, a psychiatrist at the LevinsonInstitute, Belmont, Mass. Colleague Tim Havens says theiryouthfulness makes such managers more vulnerable to harshself-criticism.   Chubb Corp. finds that the fast-track process doesn'talways give those in the fast lane the competence necessaryto do a job well, so an up-and-coming manager'sself-confidence erodes. &quot;If you put fast-trackers in the deepend of the pool too early, they'll drop to the bottom,&quot; saysDavid Fowler, Chubb's senior vice president for humanresources.   Bosses can help reduce the risk of problems by recognizingthat a young manager is out of sync. &quot;Listen hard to graspissues and viewpoints that are foreign to you,&quot; Dr. Havensurges.   Some companies send fast-trackers for special training inhow to deal with people. At others, young managers benefitfrom peer groups of fast-trackers, which provide support and&quot;relief from that odd-duck feeling,&quot; Dr. Havens says. AtChubb, young managers in distress may be reassigned to areaswhere they can restore their confidence.                                                                                                          Handling Bad News   In Annual Reports                                                                                                          FOUR MAJOR accidents forced airline managers to face thesensitive topic of how to treat the crashes in their latestannual reports to shareholders. Some bit the bullet. Onecarrier decided it was better to say nothing.   USAir Group Inc.'s report mentions the troubles thatHurricane Hugo and the California earthquake caused to itsoperations. But there was no mention that one of itsairplanes ran off a runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport inSeptember, killing two passengers and injuring 21. A USAirspokesman says the company's decision against mentioning thecrash was &quot;no attempt to sweep anything under the rug.&quot;   By contrast, UAL Corp.'s annual report details the&quot;tragic&quot; United Airlines accidents last year over the Pacificand in Sioux City, Iowa. It said rescue work by its flightcrews and Sioux City residents are now &quot;a part of UnitedAirlines' legacy.&quot; A United spokesman said there was &quot;nevermuch debate&quot; whether to mention the fatal accidents.   In a letter to shareholders, Pan Am Corp. Chairman ThomasG. Plaskett refers to the &quot;senseless murders of 270 innocentpeople&quot; who died in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight103 in December 1988. He said their deaths &quot;were personallydevastating . . . to the people of Pan Am.&quot;   Generally, investor-relations consultants favor disclosingbad news with the good. &quot;The issue is credibility,&quot; saysDenver consultant Carl Thompson. &quot;If you don't address thebad news, people won't believe your good news.&quot;                                                                                                          Computer Aids May Hurt   In Decision Making                                                                                                          COMPUTER programs designed to assist managers in makingdecisions don't always help, and sometimes can hamperperformance, a team of researchers finds.   Jeffrey E. Kottemann, assistant professor of computerinformation systems at the University of Michigan, simulateda manufacturing-production process in a growth industry. Hehad M.B.A. students decide on output and staffing, givenuncertain demand, over 24 mock quarters. One group used aspreadsheet-oriented computer aid that helped membersevaluate alternatives. The other group was on its own,relying on intuition and experience.   Contrary to Mr. Kottemann's expectations, thecomputer-assisted people significantly underperformed theunaided, in the initial experiment as well as two follow-ups.With the computer aids, he says, people appear to have soughtshort-term results by understaffing and underproducing. Butthose decisions, over time, meant lost sales and extra costs.   Oddly, the computer-aided group didn't recognize thatusing the programs led to poor decisions. &quot;They weresignificantly more confident in their performance than theunaided group,&quot; Mr. Kottemann says. He and two colleagues,Fred D. Davis Jr. and William Remus, plan further work tohelp explain when and how computer aids affect actual andperceived performance.                                                                                                          Companies Do More   Than Test for Drugs                                                                                                          DRUG TESTING by employers soared in the 1980s, but signsemerge that companies are looking to other methods to curbdrug abuse by employees.   The number of employers that test for drugs rose only 7%in the latest survey by the American Management Association,after jumping 33% in 1989.   Meanwhile, the number of big companies that trainsupervisors and managers to spot behavior that might indicatedrug use jumped 24% this year. Now 36% of respondents providesuch training, including one in five that train managers butdon't test for drugs.   Companies that provide drug education and awarenessprograms surged 38% in the latest survey, and more than half-- 51% -- of major firms now support employee-assistanceprograms for drug abusers, up from 42% in 1988. &quot;The smallincrease in the number of companies that test, and the largerincrease in the number pursuing other initiatives, is apositive finding,&quot; says Eric Greenberg, editor of themanagement group's research reports.</TEXT></DOC>
