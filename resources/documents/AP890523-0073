In Tunisia, where the Arab leaders are meeting, the PalestineLiberation Organization issued an ``official version'' of thelatest uprising leaflet, omitting an earlier call for retaliatoryslayings of Israelis.   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shotand wounded five Palestinian youths during stone-throwing proteststoday, Arab news reports said. A general strike continued in theterritories.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejected U.S. Secretary of StateJames Baker's call for Israel to stop building Jewish settlementson occupied land and essentially ignored Baker's appeal to give upthe idea of a ``greater Israel'' including the West Bank and Gaza.   ``I don't know how it is possible to speak at all of a greaterIsrael. Israel is a very small country. ... It sounds really ironicto speak of a `greater Israel,''' he said on Israel radio.   Shamir, in London meeting British officials, also said: ``I donot see any connection between settlements and the issue of thepeace process.''   Palestinians in the occupied lands reacted favorably to Baker'scomments, which came Monday in a speech in Washington, but noted hestill said the United States does not favor a Palestinian state.   ``I believe Baker's statement is positive ... but it is not thechange that the Palestinian is asking for,'' said newspaper editorZiad Abu Ziad.   The Arab League convenes today and the appeal to be presented toparticipants was published by the East Jerusalem-based Al Fajr, adaily allied with the mainstream Fatah branch of the PLO.   It urged Arab nations to form a ``higher committee'' to supportPalestinian peace proposals, which call for Israeli withdrawal fromthe occupied lands and an international peace conference.   It also sought ``support for Palestinian opposition in rejectingthe Israeli government plan to hold elections under occupation.''   Shamir's peace plan calls for Palestinians in the territories toelect representatives to negotiate with Israel on an interim periodof self-rule.   Palestinians object because the proposal does not guaranteeindependence or an end to military rule.   Arab leaders also were asked to call on the United States for``clear recognition of Palestinian rights to self-determination,''meaning an independent state.   Meanwhile, a Palestinian man from the West Bank town of Dura waskilled Monday when his car was stoned in southern Israel.   The death brought to 497 the number of Arabs killed since thePalestinian uprising against Israeli rule began 17 months ago.Twenty-two Israelis also have been killed.   WAFA, the Palestinian news agency, published the official textof leaflet No. 40, which supports killing Palestinians whocollaborate with Israel, but drops an earlier appeal to ``kill asettler or a soldier for every martyr of our sons.''   PLO spokesman Abdel Abdul-Rahman said such a call could havebeen included in a first draft.   Also today, an army spokesman confirmed soldiers had plowedthrough Arab land to build a road just inside the border with theGaza Strip ``for security reasons.''   An international development worker in Gaza said the road wasabout 8{ miles long and 20 yards wide. The development worker, whospoke on condition of anonymity, said small farms that containedorange and olive trees and wheat and chickpea fields had beendestroyed to build the road.</TEXT></DOC>
