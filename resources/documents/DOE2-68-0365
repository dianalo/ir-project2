A growing number of genetic diseasescan be accurately diagnosed, and more genetic information of potentialvalue to individuals and families is now available. By providing thisimportant information, well-designed and carefully implemented geneticscreening and counseling programs give individuals greater opportunitiesto make informed, autonomous decisions about their own health and aboutreproduction. Screening and counseling programs can also make major contributionsto public health and personal well-being by reducing the incidence ofgenetic disease and by facilitating more-effective management and treatment.In the next decade, the authors anticipate the expansion of genetic servicesincluding genetic screening due to increased research efforts and theability to rapidly apply new knowledge to a myriad of clinical problems.Each new advance will pose new problems and new questions, all of whichwill continue to be addressed by concerned geneticists, physicians, legislators,and the public.</TEXT></DOC>
