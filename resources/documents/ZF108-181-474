 The shareware philosophymakes it possible for computer users, from novices to professionals, to tryout software without violating the author's intent.andP;  If you decide to adoptthe software, you send the author a specified license fee and, voila, you'rea registered user.andP;  PC-File:dB maintains the proud tradition of thisphilosophy.andP;  While shareware products are occasionally an expression ofhubris, Jim Button's pride in this product is justified.andM;PC-File:dB is an easy-to-use flat-file manager that accesses DBF files.andP;  Allits operations are menu driven.andP;  The main menu even tells you how manyrecords can be accommodated on your current drive and what index is active(see Fig.andP;  1).andP;  Going one step further than most flat-file systems,PC-File:dB lets you define &quot;relational fields.&quot;andP;  These can be real or virtual(calculated values or expressions) bits of data that enable look-ups intoother data files.andM;Presto!andP;  A new databaseandM;Defining a new data file is refreshingly simple.andP;  You're presented with twomethods for specifying the file structure.andP;  Your choice will depend onwhether you're a left- or right-brain oriented individual.andP;  Linear types willprefer to list the field names in neat columns and rows.andP;  But if you givePC-File:dB to new users, they're more likely to prefer painting the screenand marking the lengths of the fields (see Fig.andP;  2).andP;  This approach is easierto conceptualize, and it creates a data entry form that's attached to thedata file for input and display.andM;The thrill of the huntandM;PC-File:dB doesn't sacrifice ease of use by eliminating searchoptions--instead it pours them on, separating them into &quot;simple&quot; and&quot;complex&quot; categories.andM;When you search for data the simple way, PC-File:dB presents a screen formwith all of the fields--a query-by-example approach.andP;  Enter values, andthey're found (see Fig.andP;  3).andP;  Specify values in more than one field andyou're creating an AND search condition.andP;  Type in the leading characters andyou'll select all records starting with them (equivalent to the dBASE SETEXACT OFF).andP;  For example, typing &quot;Al&quot; finds &quot;Albert,&quot; &quot;Alfred,&quot; and&quot;Alberta.&quot;andM;GoodiesandM;Veteran dBASE users will find a thing or two that they can't get elsewhere(you might come close with add-ons like Friendly Finder from ProximityTechnologies).andP;  If you've ever wanted to search for characters located in aspecific position in a field, PC-File:dB gives you a way.andP;  Type in anunderscore as the wildcard character and literals in the other positions.andO;For example if you're searching for records with the letter &quot;a&quot; in the secondposition of a last name field, you key in: &quot;a&quot;.andM;There's also a search strategy for identifying characters anywhere in afield.andP;  The PC-File:dB manual calls this &quot;scan across.&quot;andP;  When you want tofind records containing &quot;are&quot; in the LASTNAME field, you'd type &quot;~are&quot;.andO;There's also a soundex-type search.andP;  These are all simple search options, andit doesn't stop there.andM;To create a search with the OR operator, opt for a &quot;complex search.&quot;andP;  This iswhere you use Boolean formulas.andP;  The syntax and structure of PC-File:dBsearch formulas is eclectic, with more than a passing resemblance to the Clanguage.andP;  To find all Californians with the last name Castro or Kalman,you'd key in:andM;(1name = 'CASTRO' | 1name = &quot;KALMAN&quot;); andamp; state = &quot;CA&quot;)andM;How it worksandM;Until dBASE IV came around, dBASE products left most of the work to users andprogrammers.andP;  If you wanted to view a data file in indexed order, you had toopen the index file.andP;  If you forgot what indexes were associated with whichdata file, you were out of luck.andP;  Ashton-Tate's built a solution into thedBASE IV catalogs.andP;  PC-File:dB solves the same problem.andP;  It creates acompanion HDB header file.andP;  Create BUDGET.DBF, and BUDGET.HDB is also placedin the directory.andP;  Since this is a modified flat-file system (primarilymanaging just one data file at a time), this header file is only concernedwith objects that serve that particular file.andP;  BUDGET.HDB tracks the dataentry screen, calculated fields, and index files.andM;Other cornersandM;Going back to COBOL, there have always been input masks for data control.andO;PC-File:dB includes them too, but doesn't observe the dBASE conventions.andP;  Tospecify upper case only, type in :AZ: (meaning upper case from A to Z).andM;PC-File:dB can't handle linked files, but it does accommodate a special typeof calculated field, called a &quot;relational field,&quot; which makes look-upspossible (look-ups are operations where the input triggers a seek intoanother data file).andP;  In my user group database, you enter a code for themember's status.andP;  A relational field (STAT Name) is placed in the membersfile to display the full description of the status code.andP;  This relationalfield's definition indicates which field contains the data key, what datafile to consult (you can specify the path if necessary), what field to scanin that file, and what field from that record to display.andP;  If the status codeappears in the &quot;related&quot; status code file, its description appears on screen.andM;Are look-ups hard to implement?andP;  Not terribly--for someone comfortable withthe product.andP;  but you have to create the look-up file first.andP;  Then it's amatter of typing a look-up function &quot;(@status, status, status, describe)&quot;into a field definition box.andP;  The menu system guides you and the manualexplains the process step-by-step.andP;  A capable manager or skilledadministrative assistant should pick up the idea in an hour or so.andP;  My onlygripe is that the related field isn't always displayed--it appears only afteryou add or modify a record.andP;  Searches only reveal a blank field.andM;You don't have to be programmer to include calculated fields in your screens.andO;If you'd like to display unit profit on a sale, calculate the field.andP;  Priceis tracked in your master data file, while cost is located in a look-up.andO;Instead of defining a standard field, you type in a formula combining anarithmetic calculation and a look-up formula (price - @profit, parts, partno, cost).andM;Reports are flexible and easy to create.andP;  You can specify one of fourformats: page format outputs one record per page with field names to the leftof the data.andP;  Row format creates a dBASE III PLUS-type report, with onerecord per row.andP;  You can paint a report in free-form mode.andP;  The last methoduses a report command language.andP;  This approach requires the most effort andis best left to those who enjoy creating Lotus macros.andP;  Labels are a specialcase of reports.andM;Graphic proofandM;With the exception of dBXL, you just can't get graphs from anyother dBASEDBMS without an add-on.andP;  And you'd be hard pressed to find features likesmoothed averages or least squares regressions among the add-ons.andP;  PC-File:dBhandles these, and many other graph types, including line, horizontal bar,stacked bar, vertical pie, scatter, and others, and provides output driversfor Epson, HP LaserJet, IBM Graphics, and Okidata printers.andM;The array of possibilities is impressive.andP;  Grids can be applied, and you canuse a logarithmic Y axis.andP;  You can also request curve fitting.andP;  You cannotspecify increments for the Y axis, nor can you indicate the starting andending values.andM;Thoughtful touchesandM;Keystrokes can be stored as macros (called &quot;smart keys&quot;).andP;  This minimizes theagony of experienced users who want to bypass menus for routine operations.andO;An &quot;autoexec&quot; kind of macro can also be specified in the configurationscreen.andP;  You can edit any of the smart keys from within PC-File:dB.andM;Software vendors often use the Roach Motel model for data; they'll importfrom other file structures--they just won't send it back out.andP;  PC-File:dBwrites and reads the following formats: WordPerfect, dBASE SDF, SYLK,PeachText, comma delimited, user-defined delimited, Lotus, and DIF.andM;PC-File:dB may be menu driven, but it gives you a feeling of control overyour data.andP;  Before starting batch processes, the product often shows you asample record, asking you to confirm that you want to proceed.andP;  This isespecially helpful in assuring a successful import session.andP;  You can then optto accept and reject records one by one or to do the entire job.andM;DocumentationandM;Even that best software can suffer from poor manuals.andP;  You won't have thatproblem here.andP;  Two perfect-bound manuals are provided in the direct saleversion: one for the beginner and one for the user.andP;  The beginner's guide isa reasonable introduction to the product's fundamentals, including mail mergeand graphs.andP;  Both books are written in everyday English and abstract conceptsare elaborated with crisp examples.andP;  While bigger software publishers canpour greater resources into prettier packages, they could still learn fromthe contents of these two exemplary books.andM;Limitations and quirksandM;Often you'll want to index your data using a compound key (for example, onlast name and first name).andP;  PC-File:dB can't do that--yet (see theaccompanying article on version 2.0).andM;You can have default values entered into the database as you add records.andO;Oddly enough, when you want a default numeric value (in this case, user groupdues are $60), you must enter the value in quotes.andP;  This isn't likely todisturb users who are less computer literate, but it's still inconsistentwith data typing.andM;Since writing my article on TSR dBASE utilities (&quot;dBASE In Residence,&quot; July1989), I make it a practice to check for date validation.andP;  PC-File:dBneglects this simple data checking at input time.andM;When I exited the graph module after examining the sample graph and data fileprovided with the package, an error appeared as the main module reloaded.andP;  Itseems the graph format contains the drive and directory information of themachine that created it.andP;  I was working on drive E, and the sample graph anddata file was created on drive C.andP;  When PC-File:dB encountered the problem,it prompted me for the correct drive and path, quickly skirting the problem.andO;Once I created graphs of my own, the problem disappeared.andP;  If you'veinstalled PC-File:dB according to the defaults, all goes as planned.andM;In a data file with more than 550 records, I got a pie chart on screen inless than a minute.andP;  Decimals didn't appear, so percentages less than oneappeared as zero percent.andP;  The menu doesn't offer a way to specify decimalpositions or rounding.andP;  Printing time on a LaserJet II was reasonably--about90 seconds.andP;  Printer memory was fine at the default configuration of 512K.andM;Leader of the PACKandM;Although a pack utility program is provided, don't bother.andP;  Records markedfor deletion are reused rather than removed as you add new records.andP;  You canrecall deleted records but you must do it before they're reclaimed.andP;  Theprocess of recalling deletions is typical of the product--it's comprehensiveand you're guided through every step.andP;  PC-File:dB scans the entire file fordeleted records, displaying them one at a time for you to approve.andP;  I wouldrate the deletion and packing functions as excellent.andM;A winnerandM;Because of its reputation as an &quot;easy&quot; product, I would never have dreamedI'd be saying this: I expect to use PC-File:dB for routine queries on DBFfiles.andP;  That's not to say I'll abandon programmable database managers.andP;  Butthere are times when everyone needs an unobtrusive file manager, andPC-File:dB fits this category at a reasonable price.andP;  PC-File:dB comes froman established software company with progressive distribution and supportpolicies.andP;  You can't beat the price, and the manufacturer hasn't skimped onfeatures.andP;  Jim Button has evolved a mature product (PC-File in one version oranother has been on the market for years) and in keeping with the goals ofuser computing, he's developed a product that's deceptively simple--andsurprising powerful.andM;If this sounds appealing, you can go off and do your own review--fly now andpay later.andP;  You can download a version of PC-File:dB from the Data BasedAdvisor Readers Exchange BBS, (619) 270-2042, obtain it on this month'sProgram Disk, or call the company.andM;PriceandM;PC-File:dB is available for $89.95.andP;  PC-File:dB requires an IBM PC.andP;  PS/2 orcompatible, DOS 2.0 or later, 416K RAM, two 720K floppies or a hard disk.andO;(If you're working strictly off 360K floppy drives, ButtonWare sells PC-FilePlus, recently upgraded to version 2.0.)andP;  ButtonWare, Inc. is located at P.O.andO;Box 5786, Bellevue, Wash.andP;  98006, phone (206) 454-0479.andM;UPDATE:andM;A First Look at PC-File 5.0andM;Buttonware promised an impressive set of features for release 5.0, so I askedfor an early look.andP;  The product is due to ship this month.andP;  (If you'rewondering where the &quot;5.3&quot; came from, the company counted up all the releasesfor their product, and this one will be their fifth.)andM;The cosmetics are overhauled.andP;  The main menu has been streamlined while therest of the package has benefited from &quot;prettification.&quot;andP;  Just abouteverything appears in a &quot;shadow-box&quot; menu with light bar selections (see thefigure).andP;  Indexing progress is measured in percentages rather than absoluterecord counts.andP;  Someone at Buttonware must have been eavesdropping around myoffice; they've addressed my deficiency list.andP;  Compound index keys, forexample, will be possible.andP;  Select &quot;user-defined keys&quot; and you'll be able totype in a legitimate dBASE language expression.andP;  And you can generatedescending indexes too.andP;  Searches will attempt to pull in the appropriateindexes when available.andM;dBASE product vendors have all had to confront the poor structure of dBASEmemo files.andP;  They grow and grow--in 512-byte increments.andP;  And when you deletethe contents of memos or records, the disk space isn't typically released.andO;Ashton-Tate addressed that design flaw in dBASE IV, which resulted in somefile incompatibilities.andP;  Everyone else has had to copy packed files toanother name using their database product.andP;  This isn't acceptable with largedata files or full hard disks.andP;  Buttonware's built some memo efficienciesinto version 5.0, so text-based data files are easier to manage.andM;Some of the new features are beyond my wildest dreams.andP;  The graph moduleseems faster in the beta version and includes Postscript support.andP;  Also addedis support for C.andP;  Itoh, NEC, Diablo dot matrix, Radio Shack, and Toshibadevices.andP;  While PC-File:dB 1.1 had a shell-to-DOS feature, release 5.0 hasjoined the swap-to-disk club, making it possible to free up most of DOSmemory to run big applications from a suspended PC-File session.andP;  A telephonedialer is slated to appear.andP;  Although this feature wasn't operational atreview time, complete documentation was available.andP;  This feature will be asnap if you have a Hayes-compatible modem or dialer.andM;Even in its beta version, operations such as sequential searches and indexingseem to be faster, and screen I/O is noticeably crisper.andP;  If the early betaedition I examined is any indication, this one is going to be worth the wait.andM;Marc Schnapp operates Micro Business Services, Inc. of Queens, New York andserves as president of the Professional Association of Database Developers inNew York City.andP;  He trains programmers and new users in the nuances ofClipper, dBASE IV, FoxPro, and Framework III and also provides technicalwriting services to developers and corporate clients.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
