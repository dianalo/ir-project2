HIDLAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Japan operated a secret chemical weapons factoryduring World War II, bombed China with poison gas grenades andtested poison on prisoners of war, including Americans, a newreport charges.   The report in the October issue of the Chicago-based Bulletin ofthe Atomic Scientists also contends the U.S. government knew aboutJapan's use of chemical weapons but failed to prosecute Japaneseofficers at the Tokyo war crimes tribunal in 1946.   The report's author, Yuki Tanaka, speculated the U.S. governmentdecided against prosecuting because it wanted to learn from Japan'sknowledge of bacteriological warfare.   ``The use of chemical weapons (by the Japanese) was covered upby the U.S. government,'' Tanaka said Saturday in a telephoneinterview from his home in Australia.   Tanaka, a lecturer in Japanese at the University of Adelaide inAustralia, drew on newly discovered Japanese war documents, his owninterviews and previously published material to piece together theaccount, said Len Ackland, the Bulletin's editor.   ``I think what you have here is the first full story of Japan'spoison gas enterprise and its grim results both on the Chinese andon the Japanese workers,'' he said Friday.   Tanaka said his research was prompted partly by the Japanesegovernment's long-time insistence that it never used chemicalweapons in World War II. Japan signed the 1925 Geneva Conventionthat banned use of such weapons.   Tanaka said his research showed that Japan built a factory forchemical weapons on Okunoshima, one of dozens of tiny islands inthe Inland Sea. To help keep the factory secret, Tanaka contends,the Japanese government erased the island from maps in 1939.   The factory operated from 1929 until the end of World War II,when it was destroyed at the direction of Allied officers. Theplant manufactured a variety of chemicals, including mustard gas,lewisite, nausea gas and hydrocyanic acid gas for use againstChina, Tanaka's report said.   Neither the Japanese nor U.S. governments would respond to thereport in the Bulletin, a monthly magazine founded in 1945 andsupported by scientists concerned about the implications of nuclearweapons development.   The Japanese foreign ministry would not make an official commentdespite repeated calls from The Associated Press. But a Ministry ofEducation official said, ``We have not gathered enough evidence tospecify it as a historical event.''   The U.S. Defense and State departments also declined comment onthe report through several public affairs officers, all of whomrefused to be identified.   Atrocities committed during the Japanese invasion of China,which began shortly before World War II, have long been a source ofcontroversy between the two countries. Chinese army records allegethat at least 2,000 Chinese were killed and 35,000 injured byJapanese chemical weapons, Tanaka's report said.   Tanaka wrote that in 1983, researchers from Keio Universityobtained a two-volume report on Japan's experiments withbacteriological and chemical weapons on Chinese, Soviet, Americanand Polish prisoners in the early 1940s.   The article gave no detail on the tests on Americans but saidChinese were subjected to mustard gas attacks and it quotedresearch notes on the resulting damage to their skin.   In another test, Chinese prisoners had to drink a liquid form ofthe chemical; in a third, some of the liquid was dropped in the eyeof a prisoner, Tanaka reported. Documents do not say what happenedto the prisoners.   In his article, Tanaka contends that U.S. Col. Thomas Morrow, alaw officer assigned to investigate Japanese war crimes, uncoveredevidence of Japan's use of chemical weapons and wrote two reportsabout it.   But Tanaka said Morrow ``was summoned home abruptly'' from Tokyoin the early stages of the war crimes trials, ``and the issue wasdropped, possibly because the U.S. government was interested inkeeping information relating to biological and chemical warfare forits own use.''   ``My intention was to warn of the danger of chemical weapons,''Tanaka said. ``So I hope the U.S. and other major countries whichare producing chemical weapons will reconsider.''   The report also said medical specialists from HiroshimaUniversity have tracked nearly 5,800 former employees of thechemical weapons factory who suffered lasting injuries from workingwith the substances.   ``Cancer of the respiratory organs is particularly high,suggesting a direct link with the inhalation of poison gas,'' thereport said.   One worker ``recalled in an interview that the factory was socontaminated that workers had to keep an eye on caged parakeets,which dropped dead when gas leakage rose,'' the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
