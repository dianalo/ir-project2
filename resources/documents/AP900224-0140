He was 63.   Ray, who had entered Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Feb. 16 withliver failure, died at 4 p.m., said hospital spokesman Ron Wise.   ``His family and friends were with him at the time of hisdeath,'' Wise said.   In the early 1950s, the slender, boyish singer revolutionizedpopular music with his unique blend of rhythm and blues, countryand gospel punctuated with real-sounding sobs.   Some said his raw and emotional style opened the door to a newtype of music that later became rock 'n' roll.   Ray's first hit record was ``Cry,'' followed by ``The LittleWhite Cloud That Cried,'' ``Please Mr. Sun,'' ``Brokenhearted, ''``What's the Use,'' ``Somebody Stole My Gal,'' ``Who's Sorry Now,''and ``Yes Tonight Josephine.''   ``Cry,'' perhaps Ray's greatest hit, has sold more than 25million copies since its original release, said his publicist, AlanEichler.   Ray's raw and emotional style was controversial for the early1950s, and he drew huge crowds in nightclub appearances in New Yorkand elsewhere.   As the press reached for phrases to describe his performance,Ray was crowned at various times as ``The Prince of Wails,'' ``TheNabob of Sob,'' ``The Howling Success,'' `The Song Wringer,'' ``TheCry Guy'' and the ``Master of Misery.''   ``Of course the days are gone of the screaming teen-agers _ andnobody had them screaming more than I did,'' Ray recalled in a 1984interview with the Associated Press.   ``But even in those days I had the same kind of audience I havenow _ the elderly, the middle-aged and the young kids,'' he said.``I don't have a TV series, I've had no hit records.   Ray was born Jan. 10, 1927, in Dallas, Ore., a tiny town nearSalem.   It was there he saw his first movie when he was 3 or 4. ``It wasEdna Mae Oliver in `Murder on the Blackboard,' and from then on Iwanted to be a movie star,'' he told the AP.   In 1954, Darryl F. Zanuck gave him a seven-year contract with20th Century Fox and he appeared with Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey,Marilyn Monroe, Donald O'Connor and Mitzi Gaynor in ``There's NoBusiness Like Show Business.''   His movie career ended, however, when Zanuck resigned to becomean independent producer. Ray recalled that the new chief at Fox wasnot a fan.   Ray's success as a recording artist also waned in the UnitedStates as other forms of rock 'n' roll gained popularity.   But he remained popular in England and Australia, Eichler said,and he continued to perform there until last year.   His last public appearance was Oct. 7 at the Grand Theatre inSalem, Ore.   Ray married Marilyn Morrison in 1952, but the union lasted onlytwo years, the publicist said. He is survived by his sister, ElmaMoney, and several nieces and nephews.</TEXT></DOC>
