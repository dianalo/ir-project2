Distributioncoefficients and separation factors of the elements were determined inthe media at 90 deg C as a function of concentrations of nitric acidand methyl alcohol. Separation factors decrease significantly but theresolution of eluted elements improves with increasing temperature. Chromatographicseparation of those elements was rapidly performed by using a very smallcolumn at 90 deg C. The effluent of the column received on a metal diskcan be readily evaporated and samples can be immediately prepared foralpha-ray spectrometry. (author) 19 refs.; 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
