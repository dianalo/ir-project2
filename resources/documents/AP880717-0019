The Sandinistas have put the brakes on recent moves to restorebasic freedoms and have cracked down on opponents with a vengeance.The measures came just days before July 19 anniversary ceremoniesbeing held in the city of Juigalpa, 85 miles east of the capital.   The government began easing restrictions on civil liberties tocomply with a regional peace plan signed in August by thepresidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and CostaRica.   The plan, aimed at ending the war here and guerrilla wars in ElSalvador and Guatemala, called on signatory nations to grantamnesties, negotiate cease-fires and undertake democratic reforms.   To comply, the Sandinistas in January lifted a 6-year-old stateof emergency. Discontent started surfacing immediately.   Opposition news media that had been shuttered or censored underthe emergency law reappeared and harshly attacked the government.   Anti-Sandinista marches, which had been prohibited, began.   With their more liberal policies, the Sandinistas achieved theirmain goal: Congress voted down a request by President Reagan torenew military aid to the Contra rebels fighting the Nicaraguangovernment.   But last week, the Sandinistas lashed out, indicating they hadhad enough and wouldn't take any more.   President Daniel Ortega and his cabinet also came under pressurefrom party hard-liners opposed to the concessions, which includedthe previously taboo step of opening negotiations with the Contras.   In a series of quick moves, the government expelled U.S.Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other American diplomats July11, a day after police beat up opponents at an anti-governmentdemonstration.   It jailed three dozen opposition figures, closed the RomanCatholic Church's Radio Catolica and a private news program, andordered La Prensa, the only opposition newspaper, to suspendpublication for 15 days.   The Sandinistas said the crackdown was a response to adestabilization plan fostered by the U.S. Embassy and increasingrebel attacks. But they offered little proof to back up theiraccusations.   Barricada, the newspaper of the Sandinista National LiberationFront, published a list Saturday of dates on which Melton and theother U.S. diplomats met with opposition groups. The headline read,``Subversive Itinerary of Melton and the CIA.'' The StateDepartment called the visits normal.   The Sandinistas have become increasingly frustrated by theirinability to end the Contra war, which is wrecking the economy andfueling public discontent.   In a move that took Washington off guard, Sandinista and rebelleaders signed a cease-fire agreement March 23, but since then theyhave made almost no headway in discussions to achieve a permanenttruce.   The initial cease-fire, extended for 30-day periods by tacitagreement on both sides, has been wearing thinner and thinner inrecent weeks, with the government recently reporting almost dailyrebel attacks.   Opposition leaders said the crackdown was motivated by thegovernment's fear that the usually fragmented opposition wasunifying. Some claimed the crackdown showed the true face of theSandinistas.   ``The mask came off and the people didn't see smiling faces.They saw gas masks,'' said Virgilio Godoy, a former Sandinistalabor minister and now president of the Independent Liberal Party,referring to the opposition protest July 10 which police broke upwith tear gas.   When the Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolution thatousted the rightist, pro-American dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza,they promised a better life to a poverty-stricken people. Theyenjoyed widespread support.   ``We knew they were Marxists, but we thought they were differentMarxists who would deal realistically with the situation here,''Godoy said. ``Many people felt deceived.''   In 1981, the United States cut off all economic aid toNicaragua, claiming the Sandinistas were exporting revolution tothe rest of Central America and serving as a Communist beachhead inthe region. A U.S.-imposed trade embargo followed in 1985.   The measures, together with U.S. support for the Contras andSandinista government mismanagement and corruption, almost scuttledthe economy. About half of Nicaragua's budget now goes to the fightagainst the Contras.   ``The economic situation, the hunger, the misery has gatheredmomentum by all citizens, and we were tapping it,'' said anotheropposition leader, Enrique Bolanos, head of the Superior PrivateEnterprise Council.   Meanwhile, supermarket shelves stand bare. The nation that onceexported rice and cotton has now turned to foreign donations forbasic food staples. Children rummage through trash piles seekingscraps of food and the average worker doesn't earn enough to feedhis family.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Bryna Brennan is an Associated Presscorrespondent in Managua who has been covering Central Americanaffairs since 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
