However, it is the image manipulationcapability which is of singular advantage in these cases. The spatialresolution of computed tomography has matched that of conventional pluridirectionaltomography in current generation equipment. Since a set of axial CT sectionscan be obtained with automatic table incrementation within 12 minutes,the information content per time of study ratio is improved over thatof conventional tomography, despite the fact that image reformation requiresextra time on the part of the radiologist. Radiation savings are significantlyin favor of computed tomography as well. In the authors' experience,computed tomography is the primary diagnostic imaging modality used inthe evaluation of complex facial trauma, after routine screening filmsare obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
