So she wasn't quite sure what she'd do when the time came tohold up the big card that announces which round it is.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BOXING RING JOINS BIKINIS AND TUXEDOS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Yet she smiled brightly, revealing that the massive lipstick attack she'dlaunched against her lips had struck teeth that were innocent bystanders. &quot;Iused to do oil wrestling,&quot; she said. &quot;We're professionals. We'll pull itoff.&quot;;    The sport of boxing, love it or hate it, has the unique andfascinating capability of joining culture and subculture. You have your tuxedoworld here and your bikini oil-wrestler world there, and for a couple of hoursthey synthesize into something else entirely.;    This certainly held true atthe Fairmont on Thursday night when a mostly male audience of 400-plus paid$250 each to dine, watch four boxing matches and smoke cigars, which created ahaze that slowly rose to envelop the ballroom chandeliers.;     THE EVENT wasstaged as a fund-raiser for the Silicon Valley Chapter of the NationalAssociation of Industrial and Office Parks. The connection between such agroup and boxing was explained to me by spokeswoman Beverley Bryant: &quot;Thetheme was, developers have been knocked around long enough -- now it's time tofight back.&quot;;    And fight back they did. The affair fostered a glitzy,stylish air, harkening to a time when a fight's significance could approximatethis era's Super Bowl. There was back-slapping and bonhomie and cigar-waving,much in the manner of our forefathers.;    Most of those in attendance dressedin the requested formal attire, but a subculture wore only silk shorts. It wasthey who, to the delight of the Tuxedos, obligingly pummeled one another withan unblinking single-mindedness one rarely sees anymore, even among realestate agents.;    Although the Tuxedos cheered wildly, few admitted to beingavid fight fans. &quot;Maybe once a month&quot; he'll watch a fight on TV, said San Joseattorney Jeff Essner.;    &quot;I think all the boys just wanted a night out,&quot; saidCheryl Piha, one of the few spouses in attendance. Her assessment of theproceedings echoed that of several of the other women: &quot;It's, um,interesting.&quot;;     THE REAL fans floated on the periphery. There was waiterCarlos Calvillo, who'd lost his name tag and had to borrow one that said&quot;Fred.&quot; I asked him: &quot;You like the fights, Fred?&quot;;    He indicated vigorousassent with an engaging smile, then added this startling confidence:&quot;Sometimes I would like to fight in the street with somebody.&quot;;    And therewas Steve Garrison, 20, a sous-chef and sometime boxer himself. Perhaps notunderstanding the developers' need to make a statement about fighting back,Steve didn't buy a ticket. &quot;Nah, I ate earlier,&quot; he said.;    He stuck closeto a door and studied the action, sucking on a plastic straw instead of acigar.;    After the last match, many of the attendants and some of the boxersadjourned to a &quot;fighter's reception&quot; at the Heartthrob Cafe across the street.At about 11:30 p.m., Benny Benjamin of Bakersfield, the manager of one of thefighters, was engaged in a losing discussion with a bouncer.;    &quot;Everybody'sgot to show a driver's license or a passport,&quot; the bouncer told Benjamin, whohad two young daughters in tow.;    Benjamin later told me the promoter hadpromised he could bring his family to the party to eat.;    What would he donow? He shrugged. &quot;Go back to the motel.&quot;;    So he and his kids proceededdown Second Street against the flow of oncoming Tuxedos. Fight night was over,and culture and subculture were separate again.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Larry slonaker column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910202  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  642  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday February 2, 199100033147,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
