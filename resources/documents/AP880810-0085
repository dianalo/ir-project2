Radicals staged protests in Seoul and other cities to preparefor a march Monday to the border truce site of Panmunjom for talkswith North Korean student delegates on reuniting the divided Koreanpeninsula. The Seoul government has banned the march and talks.   ``March to Panmumjom'' and ``Yankee go home,'' students chanted.   The government mobilized 34,000 riot police today to containdemonstrations. Police said they arrested some 200 students inSeoul for taking part in the demonstrations.   Authorities declined to give figures on the number of protests,but Korean news reports said several thousand students took part indemonstrations at about 30 universities. Turnout appeared less thanradical leaders had called for.   Students armed with firebombs and rocks clashed with riot policeat four colleges in Seoul when they were blocked from marching intothe streets. The clashes were sporadic and no injuries werereported, witnesses said.   Some 300 students shouting slogans and brandishing firebombs andclubs demonstrated around Myongdong Roman Catholic Cathedral in thecenter of Seoul. Hundreds of riot police ringed the area, but didnot try to disperse the students.   About 60 students were arrested by police when they tried tomarch to the Blue House presidential mansion.   Scattered street clashes were reported in the southern port cityof Pusan where about 500 students clashed with riot police whofired tear gas to disperse the demonstrations.   Bands of students attacked a police station and an office of thegoverning Democratic Justice Party in Pusan, police said. Twopolice officers were injured by rocks and a police bus was setablaze, they said.   Protesters demanded the Seoul government agree to North Korea'sdemand to be allowed to be a co-host for the Olympic Games thatstart Sept. 17. The International Olympic Committee has rejectedNorth Korea's demand.   ``The south and the north to the Olympic. Yankees to America,''shouted protesters, who also want withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S.troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.   The government has warned it will block the march to the borderand said no talks will be allowed with North Koreanrepresentatives. A similar march attempt in June was blocked by thegovernment.   The government insists it alone can handle contacts with NorthKorea. It has promised to arrange student meetings with the north.   Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to tryand mobilize public support. The radicals, a small but powerfulminority on college campuses, have failed to gain support becauseof their violent tactics and open advances to the north.   Most South Koreans fear the totalitarian north is determined toconquer the peninsula and recall how the north invaded the south in1950 to start the Korean War.   The students say they are not communists, but insist that thepeninsula must be reunited immediately with political differencesbeing worked out later.</TEXT></DOC>
