With 96.2 percent of the votes counted, New Democracy, led byConstantine Mitsotakis, had 46.3 percent. It was followed by formerPremier Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement with40.7 percent and the Coalition of the Left and Progress, headed byCommunist Harilaos Florakis, with 10.8 percent. The rest went tosmall parties. Official returns were broadcast by state television.   New Democracy needed 151 seats in the 300-seat single-chamberParliament to control the government after eight years of socialistrule and a brief coalition administration.   Government projections showed New Democracy with 148 seats, 128seats going to the socialists and 21 to the leftist Coalition. Theother three seats would go to independents, including oneenvironmentalist.   A tough period of bargaining was expected to begin shortly onforming a new government. The leading parties are widely dividedover such major issues as economic policy and the presence of U.S.military bases in Greece.   Mitsotakis told a news conference his party would ``act in a waythat is best for the nation'' but did not spell out his plans forworking out a coalition. ``Without a doubt our political life isentering a difficult phase,'' he said.   Papandreou said, ``It gives us special satisfaction that afterthe June elections we have had such a significant rise ... despitethe unbelievable barrage of attacks made against us and despite thefact that we were out of the government.''   Papandreou's party did not appear to be damaged by its leader'sindictment on corruption charges in September.   Polls were open from sunrise to sunset, with voting compulsoryfor the estimated 8 million citizens aged 18 and over. Finalresults were unlikely before Monday afternoon.   In Athens, motorists waving green socialist party banners orblue-and-white New Democracy flags sped through the centralSyntagma Square, leaning on their horns.   Although a national election June 18 produced no majority, theCoalition of the Left and Progress agreed to team with its enemies,the conservatives, in a short-term government dedicated only toinvestigating scandals that dogged the final years of the 1981-89socialist administration.   The coalition government resigned last month after indictingPapandreou on charges of involvement in a multimillion-dollarbanking scandal and of ordering wiretapping of the telephones offriends and foes.   Papandreou has said he is innocent and maintains the indictmentswere politically motivated.   The leader of the Communist-led coalition, Florakis, said: ``Itis an undisputed fact that the coalition will be at the center ofpost-electoral developments in our country.''   Florakis' group wants to evict U.S. bases from Greece andopposes extraditing a Palestinian suspected of terrorism, MohammedRashid, to the United States.   Mitsotakis, 71, campaigned on promises to cut the government'sheavy role in the economy and strengthen ties with NATO and theUnited States. He accused the former government of ruining theeconomy, citing a $58 billion public debt.   Papandreou, 70, promised to boost pensions and other benefits ifelected and to hold a public referendum before approving any newbase treaty with the United States.   Greece's simple proportional system makes it difficult forparties to gain an overall majority. In June, New Democracy won 145seats; the socialists got 125 seats; the Coalition got 28 seats andtwo went to independents.   Many observers said before Sunday's elections that Greece couldface a period of political instability even if one party won amajority.   That is because Parliament must elect a new president in March.While the president is largely a figurehead and has far fewerpowers than the prime minister, Greek law dictates that Parliamentmust be dissolved and new elections held if no candidate can musterthree-fifths of the vote in Parliament.   One voting irregularity was reported. The spokesman for thecaretaker government, Nikos Themelis, said authorities wereinvestigating a report that socialist supporters prevented anunknown number of sailors on two ships from disembarking to vote onthe southeastern Aegean island of Kalimnos.</TEXT></DOC>
