In a speech before the Chicago Economic Club, Mr. Baker said he believes the industrial nations should work instead to &quot;refine&quot; the international economic policy-coordinating machinery that they agreed upon at the Tokyo economic summit in May. He said finance ministers still hadn't agreed on what they might want in any new monetary system.    Mr. Baker is expected to make the recommendations to President Reagan, who asked in his State of the Union address in January that the Treasury secretary study the performance of foreign-exchange markets and report back by year's end on whether to convene an international conference.    The secretary cautioned last night that he wasn't ruling out the possibility of calling such a conference in the future -- particularly &quot;if exchange rates are volatile.&quot; He is expected to convey those views in talks with European finance ministers today and tomorrow.    He also said the administration plans to proceed cautiously in deciding whether to propose new securities laws or regulations in the wake of the Ivan F. Boesky case on Wall Street. &quot;We should wait to see what other shoes drop,&quot; Mr. Baker said. </TEXT></DOC>
