Most market analysts expect the combination to keepprices, which have been trading at around $20 a barrel in theU.S., fairly constant into the summer.</LP><TEXT>   For the current quarter, the Paris-based agency reportedyesterday that it expects world oil demand to decline by some500,000 barrels a day to 64 million barrels a day. It citedweak economic growth as a reason for the anticipated decline,which the IEA said will follow a drop of one million barrelsa day in world oil production in the first quarter.   These comparisons are on a year-to-year basis in the IEA'sMonthly Oil Market Report, released in Paris yesterday. Butthe report also supported other recent estimates that oilproduction declined as much as 1.2 million barrels a day inApril from the March level. The declines, according to theIEA, were about evenly divided between the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers.   The latter group includes the Soviet Union, the world'slargest producer, and the U.S. The IEA represents the24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment, or OECD. It now includes in its estimates supplyand demand figures for the Soviet Union and other countriesformerly grouped separately as Centrally Planned Economies.   According to the IEA, oil demand in the major Westernnations increased slightly in the first quarter from a yearearlier. For the OECD as a whole, demand rose to 38.4 millionbarrels a day from 38.3 million a year earlier although itdropped in North America to 18.5 million barrels a day from18.9 million.   For the second quarter, the IEA projects that OECD oildemand will decline 400,000 barrels a day to 36.1 million aday. North America will account for 300,000 barrels a day ofthe decline.   For all of 1991, however, the IEA still predicts thatworld oil demand will rise slightly -- by 100,000 barrels aday from the 1990 average -- to 65.8 million barrels a day.The increase will come outside the OECD, where oil demand isexpected to stay flat at 37.5 million barrels a day for theyear, although the IEA has further cut its projection for oiluse in the Soviet Union.   On the production side, the IEA confirmed previous reportsthat oil supplies in April fell significantly for the firsttime since the Persian Gulf crisis began last August. The IEAestimated that OPEC's April production, as inferred fromexports and crude oil deliveries to domestic refineries,declined 600,000 barrels a day from March to 22.6 millionbarrels a day.   The OPEC decline was due mainly to lower production inSaudi Arabia, the IEA said. But Iran also cut back by 200,000barrels a day, according to the IEA figures.   &quot;Non-OPEC output,&quot; the IEA added, &quot;is also expected tohave recorded a fall of 600,000 barrels a day since March dueto the beginning of maintenance shutdowns in the U.K. NorthSea, which are expected to depress output throughout thesecond quarter.&quot; The IEA also cited continued erosion inSoviet oil output.   The IEA's estimates support the views of others whomonitor OPEC's production. But some OPEC experts say thedecline was bigger than the IEA's figures show, possiblybringing down OPEC's current wellhead production as low as 22million barrels a day.   &quot;Supply appears to be down more than one million barrels aday for April,&quot; said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-basedconsultant on OPEC affairs. &quot;Definitely, there is an elementof cooperation between Iran and Saudi Arabia&quot; in supportingoil prices at current levels, he added.   At OPEC's headquarters in Vienna, production figures forApril haven't yet been circulated. But one official notedthat the average price of the OPEC basket of crudes, whichusually lags behind U.S. prices by about $2 a barrel, reached$18 a barrel in April after beginning the month at $16.42.&quot;My feeling,&quot; he said, &quot;is that the price wouldn't hold thatwell if production wasn't down.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
