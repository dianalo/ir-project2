Because of thisconcern, Batesville's New Progressive Warranty establishes warranty periodsthat more closely relate to the expected periods during which its casketscan be expected to remain protective.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part IV</ITAG>It is further ordered that respondent shall forthwith distribute a copyof this order, together with Attachment A to this order, to each of itsoperating divisions, and to each of its officers, agents, representativesor employees engaged in the preparation or placement of advertisementsor other sales materials.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part V</ITAG>It is further ordered that respondent notify the Commission at least thirty(30) days prior to the effective date of any proposed change in the corporaterespondent such as dissolution, assignment or sale, resulting in the emergenceof a successor corporation, the creation or dissolution of subsidiaries,or any other change in the corporation which may affect compliance obligationsarising out of this order.It is further ordered that respondent shall, within sixty (60) days afterthis order becomes final, file with the Commission a report in writing,setting forth in detail the manner and form in which it has complied withthe order.Attachment A to Order<ITAG tagnum="81">Notice About Batesville's Protective Claims</ITAG>The Federal Trade Commission has indicated that it has reason to believethat Batesville's warranty language could be understood to mean that mostBatesville caskets will remain protective throughout the warranty periodunder typical conditions of interment.<T3>Batesville's pre-1988 warranties should not have been understood tomake any claims about normal or ordinary casket durability. </T3>Pursuantto an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, Batesville wishes toremind Funeral Directors that those warranties constituted no more thana promise to replace any of its metal caskets which are found to have failedto completely resist the entrance of air, water or any outside elementduring the stated warranty period.Batesville has revised its product warranties so that, unless otherwisestated on the warranty, the replacement periods shall more closely relateto the average or typical period during which the products can be expectedto remain protective under varying interment conditions.<ITAG tagnum="81">How This Affects Funeral Directors</ITAG>Although Funeral Directors are not covered by this agreement, Funeral Directorsare prohibited from making any untrue protective claims for caskets, underthe Commission's Funeral Rule.<ITAG tagnum="29">Signed:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Batesville Casket Company, Inc.</ITAG>Attachment B to Order<ITAG tagnum="20">Batesville Casket Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Batesville, Indiana</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Dear     ,Within the past few months we provided to you materials explaining ournew warranty program. At the request of the Federal Trade Commission staff,we are replacing those materials with the enclosed materials, to removeany implication that the FTC has approved Batesville's products or warrantyprogram. The FTC, of course, does not approve the products or programsof any company. We would appreciate your substituting the new materialsfor the old ones.Please understand that the new warranties themselves remain in effect,and will be honored.<ITAG tagnum="20">Sincerely,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Batesville Casket Company.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Enclosures:</ITAG>Summary To Aid Analysis of Consent OrderThe Federal Trade Commission has accepted subject to final approval anagreement to a proposed consent order from Batesville Casket Company (Batesville).The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty(60) days for receipt of comments by interested persons. Comments receivedduring this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments receivedand will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and takeother appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained inthe agreement.This matter concerns claims about the length of time Batesville's casketscan be expected to remain airtight and watertight, and thus protective,after interment.The Commission's complaint charges Batesville with misrepresenting, throughits warranties and advertising, that its caskets would ordinarily remainprotective for the warranty period, when the reasonably expected protectiveperiod in most soil conditions was actually far shorter. The complaintalso charges that Batesville made these long-term protective claims withouta reasonable basis for them.In addition, the complaint charges that Batesville misrepresented thatthe Commission had approved or endorsed the company's warranty programand product design.The complaint alleges that the misrepresentations and the use of unsubstantiatedclaims are unfair and deceptive in violation of Section 5 of the FederalTrade Commission Act.Part I of the proposed consent order would prohibit future misrepresentationsand unsubstantiated claims concerning casket durability or Commission endorsementof the company's products or programs.Part II of the order would require the company to keep records of its substantiationfor durability claims, as well as any information it has that may tendto contradict the claims.Part III of the order would require Batesville to notify its customersand the media in which it advertises that its caskets could not be expectedto remain protective for the past warranty periods. Because Batesvillehas recently changed its warranty durations and product design, and hasnotified customers specifically as to which new warranty durations representsubstantiated durabiltiy claims and which do not, the order would not requireadditional notification to those who were sent the recent notice.Parts IV through VI of the proposed order are standard notice and reportingprovisions to ensure compliance with the order.The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposedorder. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of theagreement and proposed order or to modify their terms in any way.<ITAG tagnum="6">Benjamin I.
