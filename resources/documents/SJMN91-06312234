You toldher, &quot;Money belongs in a bank where it is safe from fire and theft, and cangenerate interest.&quot;;   Well, Ann, I put a pencil to this one and here's what Idiscovered: Had &quot;Secret Saver&quot; banked her money at 5 percent, she would have$124,642 today.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MATTRESS SAVINGS IN HER WORST INTEREST  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Say it again. It's not smart to put your money under the mattress.;   --R.L., Orland Park, Ill.;   DEAR R.L. -- Thanks for your good letter. You wereclose, but no cigar.;   Peter R. Frye, senior vice president of LaSalleNational Trust, Chicago, wrote as follows:;   &quot; 'Secret Saver' is an excellentexample of what can be lost in compounding interest rates when money is hiddenat home instead of doing something much safer and more creative.;  &quot;Alternative A: 'Secret Saver' probably added to her fund each year. Assumingshe contributed $760.87 ($35,000 divided by 46 years) at the end of each yearand earned a 5 percent (after-tax or tax-deferred) yield, she would have abalance today of $128,347.41.;   &quot;Alternative B: Assume 'Secret Saver' startedwith $35,000 in an investment 46 years ago and averaged a 5 percent (after-taxor tax-deferred) return for 46 years. In 1991, she would have a balance of$330,199.04.;   &quot;Those who read your column will readily appreciate the valueof compounding interest rates. It should also make them aware of the benefitsof prudent financial guidance.&quot;;   DEAR ANN -- My husband died in 1988. Ourmarriage was wonderful.;   Ten months ago, I started to see a nice gentlemanwho has since proposed. I have put off giving him an answer because I feltthat I was being unfaithful to my deceased husband.;   Yesterday whilecleaning out a closet, I came across an old wallet that belonged to my latehusband. It contained two pictures of our children and two photos of a marriedwoman co-worker. The pictures were about 15 years old. His co-worker wasmarried then and still is. I liked her a lot.;   I am deeply hurt and havecome to the conclusion that he had an affair with this woman. With thisdiscovery came the feeling that I no longer have to be tied to my husband, andI have accepted my friend's marriage proposal.;   My children think I amreplacing their father and they are unhappy. Part of me feels that if theirfather had a secret affair, it should remain a secret. The other part of mesays I should tell my children so they would not be so bitter about myremarrying.;   -- Freedom Anonymous;   DEAR FREEDOM -- Say nothing to sullyyour husband's image. You need not drag your discovery into the picture tojustify your remarriage. After your three years alone, your children should bethrilled that you have someone with whom you can share your life.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ann Landers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911107  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  495  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, November 7, 199100312234,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
