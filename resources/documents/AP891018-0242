The worm, a piece of software similar to a computer virus, isrelatively harmless but annoying, said Ron Tencati, securitymanager for the Space Physics Analysis Network in Greenbelt, Md. Itflashes a message saying:   Worms Against Nuclear Killers   Your System Has Been Officially WANKed   The network links a wide range of universities and governmentinstallations such as NASA and Defense Department research centers,but none of the computers on it are involved in top-secret work,Tencati said Tuesday.   The worm was spotted early Monday, soon after the triggering ofa rare but harmful virus last Friday. That virus, known asDatacrime or Columbus Day, attacked personal computers, not the bigcomputers affected by the worm.   The Wank worm has not caused damage to any NASA installation _especially the Kennedy Space Center, which is preparing to launchthe shuttle Atlantis on Wednesday _ according to Charles Redmond, aNASA spokesman.   ``No secret data, no classified data, nothing of a nationalsecurity nature has been violated,'' Redmond said.   The worm can only get into computers whose users have neglectedfairly basic security procedures, such as keeping their passwordsdifferent from their user names, Tencati said.   Security at most computer centers is good enough that the wormshould not spread too widely, he said.   The worm attacks a network of Digital Equipment Corp.'s Vaxcomputers known as DECnet Internet. That network is similar to butseparate from the main Internet network, which was attacked lastyear by a worm created by a Cornell University graduate student.   Besides flashing its anti-nuclear message, the worm frightenscomputer users by making them think incorrectly that their fileshave been deleted. It also scrambles passwords and flashes shortfortune cookie-style messages to other, uninfected computers.   The main components of the DECnet Internet are theNASA-administered Space Physics Analysis Network, with about 5,500computers, and its European counterpart, the European Space PhysicsAnalysis Network, with about 500; as well as the High EnergyPhysics Network, with about 8,000 computers, and its Europeancounterpart, European HEPnet, with about 1,000.   The worm gets into the computers through a ``backdoor'' openingin the software program designed to let users do some tailoring ontheir computers for their own purposes.   The U.S. government previously advised users to close theopening, but many have not done so because the software change incomputers takes about two hours to perform, Redmond said.   Several of the 99 messages that the worm can broadcast areracially or ethnically offensive, said Michael Alexander, areporter for Computerworld, a weekly newspaper, who researched theissue.</TEXT></DOC>
