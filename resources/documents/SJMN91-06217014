Skirmishes were reported in the Slavoniaregion of eastern Croatia and in the coastal region west of Knin, areas thatappear to be continuing targets of rebel Serbs, who oppose Croatia'sindependence ambitions and who want to link Serb-populated areas of Croatia toSerbia.;     Sources in Serbian guerrilla units have indicated in recent daysthat they plan to consolidate their gains in the Slavonia region, targetingareas north and east of the town of Osijek, along the Danube River. Croatianauthorities said 158 mortar rounds hit Vukovar, 21 miles east of Osijek, onFriday night and early Saturday.;     Incidents also were reported in thecoastal region towns of Obravac and Bentkovac, where electricity was said tohave been cut off.;    The guerrilla leaders also said they do not plan tohalt their campaign until Croatia indicates that it is willing to negotiate aredrawing of the borders between Serbia and Croatia. Serb territorialambitions range from about half to approximately two-thirds of Croatianterritory.;    Croatia's representative to the collective federal presidencyvoted against the presidency's cease-fire order, complaining that it failed toname the aggressor in the conflict, &quot;which is Serbia,&quot; he said.;    ButCroatian President Franjo Tudjman, reflecting some of the sense that Croatiais against the wall militarily, said, &quot;We do accept the cease-fire as such.But what we do not accept is one part of this decision.&quot;;    Tudjman saidCroatia refused to accept the appointment of Branko Kostic, a Montenegranregarded as an ally of Serbia's communist government, as head of a trucemonitoring body. Serbia was repeatedly criticized, along with the officiallyneutral Yugoslav federal army, in a 15-point resolution approved by theCroatian parliament.;    But in approving its third government in eightmonths, the parliament appeared to be ready to take a more conciliatoryapproach to the crisis, with the apparent recognition that the militarycampaign, so far, has gone decisively against Croatian interests.;    Tworelative moderates, Luka Bebic and Ivan Vekic, were appointed, respectively,as defense and interior ministers. Bebic replaces hard-liner Sime Djodan.Martin Spegelj, a former defense minister and the present head of the nationalguard, was fired by Tudjman.;    The new government includes representativesfrom seven parties besides Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union, analliance billed as a &quot;national unity government.&quot; It includes one ethnic Serb.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Zagreb, Yugoslavia  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910804  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  509  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday August 4, 199100217014,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
