Defense Minister Abdul-Maguid Khalil said the coup was attemptedon Saturday against the Moslem government, whose factions arequarreling over a proposed peace agreement with Christian andanimist rebels.   He confirmed a report in the newspaper Al-Siyassa, which saidsecurity personnel arrested 25 retired military officers and formercivilian officials from the former government of President GaafarNimeiri.   Nimeiri was ousted in a coup April 6, 1985.   The Al-Siyassa report was the third newspaper report of anattempted coup in Sudan in the past two weeks.   After the report appeared, about 300 demonstrators ignored anemergency government order, gathering in Khartoum's Liberty Squareto demand government approval of a tentative agreement to stopSudan's civil war.   Relief officials estimate at least 500,000 people died this yearfrom famine due to drought and civil war.   Riot police and plainclothes security men ringed the square asprotestors chanted ``No, no to war'' and ``Yes, yes to peace.''   The Democratic Union Party, the second-largest member of thegovernment coalition led by Mahdi's Umma Party, signed the peaceagreement with the Sudan People's Liberation Army on Nov. 16.   The tentative pact calls for a cease-fire, a conference tonegotiate a permanent peace, a new constitution and a freeze onimplementing Sudan's Islam-based legal code.   Rebel leader John Garang began his civil rebellion in early 1983to press demands for what he considers fairer economic, politicaland administrative treatment for southern Sudan.   The crowd broke up only after they were asked to leave by AbbasAwad, a member of the organizing committee representing 54 politicalparties and labor groups supporting the peace agreement.   ``We have specific information about plots aimed at jeopardizingdemocracy in the country and that the demonstration of today wouldhave been used as a springboard for this purpose,'' Abbas told thecrowd.   Interviewed later, he said the Democratic Union Party canceledthe demonstration because a ``group was planning to counter (it) ... to spread chaos so that the army would intervene.''   Parliament voted 136-78 Wednesday to authorize Mahdi to convene aconstitutional peace conference Dec. 31 and invite the rebels toattend, according to the Egyptian state-run Middle East News Agency.   The conference is a key clause of the peace agreement, but theDemocratic Unionist Party and Garang have been insisting that theentire accord be approved before convening the conference.   The vote in effect overruled the Democratic Unionist Partydemand, prompting some of its members to threaten to withdraw fromthe coalition that also includes the Moslem Fundamentalist NationalIslamic Front.   The front oppposes the peace plan because it calls for freezingSudan's Islamic legal code until an alternative was reached.</TEXT></DOC>
