It is shown that according to calculationresults of structural vacancies critical concentration Z/sub c/ the highestdeviation from stoichiometry in terms of carbon are observed for 4 grouptransition metal carbides, and among them - for TiC/sub 1-z/ titaniumcarbide. On the whole, results of calculating position of homogeneityregion lower boundary for B1 type structure MC/sub 1-z/ nonstoichiometriccarbides well agree with available experimental data as to quality andquantity.</TEXT></DOC>
