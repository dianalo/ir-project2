Jason Davis drew laughs from reporters when he ended a briefmeeting with Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., by asking the senator if hewould run for governor now that George Deukmejian has announced hewill not seek re-election.   ``I don't know,'' a surprised Wilson said. ``A lot of people areasking me to think about it; a lot are asking me to do it. ... Bothare great jobs; I wish I had two lives.''   Davis got a taste of politics as he sat in the senator's chair,posed for photographs and placed a call to Senate Minority LeaderBob Dole's office. The Kansas Republican was not in and Davis left amessage for him to call Wilson.   Earlier in the day, Davis toured the White House and the Capitol,and met Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. Davis was scheduled to attendthe inauguration and a black-tie ball Friday. Wilson also arrangedfor Davis to meet Vice President-elect Dan Quayle.   The Sacramento teenager was in Washington under the auspices ofthe Make-A-Wish Foundation, which helps make dreams come true forchildren with life-threatening diseases. At the age of five, Daviswas diagnosed as having Fanconi anemia, which severely affects hisblood count.   Davis had worked for the campaign of President-elect Bush andwanted to attend the inauguration. His doctor, Mary Retzer,contacted the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which picked up the expensesfor Davis' trip.   ``I like science and politics. I'll get into both,'' said Davis.</TEXT></DOC>
