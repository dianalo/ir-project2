A West German television station, meanwhile, reported thatWestern diplomats negotiating with the kidnappers of Westernhostages in Lebanon were making progress in efforts to win thecaptives' release.   Ash-Shiraa said Paris and Tehran had agreed on the release oftwo French hostages in Lebanon in return for ``the release ofIranian assets frozen in France in addition to a $1 billioncompensation to Iran.''   The magazine apparently was referring to full repayment of abillion-dollar loan made by the late Shah of Iran to France anddisputed interest which could amount to an additional billiondollars.   ``Last minute snags delayed the release,'' the magazine saidwithout further elaboration.   There had been reports of an imminent French hostage releaseearlier this month. But the April 5 hijack of a Kuwait Airwaysjetliner by Shiite extremists apparently delayed the negotiations.   Ash Shiraa aslo indicated that France's insistance on therelease of a third French hostage was delaying implementation ofthe alleged deal.   ``The deal (to release the two) was not carried out pendingcompletion of negotiations for the release of a third Frenchhostage in Lebanon,'' the report said. It did not disclose furtherdetails.   The magazine Ash-Shiraa gained international fame when it brokethe story of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in 1986.   The pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, a group ofLebanese Shiite extremists, holds French diplomats Marcel Cartonand Marcel Fontaine in addition to journalist Jean-Paul Kaufmann.The three were kidnapped in 1985 in Moslem west Beirut.   The West German SAT 1 television station, quoting unidentifiedsources, also said that missing Anglican Church envoy Terry Waitewas being held in a Beirut school cellar, guarded by Iraniandiplomatic employees.   Western diplomats are negotiating with Hezbollah, a pro-Iranianradical Shiite Moslem group believed to be holding Westernhostages, SAT 1 said. It said progress was being made, especiallyin the case of Rudolf Cordes, who is reported to be seriously ill.   Cordes, a West German businessman, was kidnapped in Beirut inJanuary 1987. Aother West German, Alfred Schmidt, was kidnappeddays later but was released last September.   Twenty-two foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing inLebanon.   Terry Anderson, 40, the chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. He has been heldthe longest.</TEXT></DOC>
