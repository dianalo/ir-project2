LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Justice Ministry today prohibited14 relatives of former President Chun Doo-hwan from leaving thecountry while the government investigates alleged corruption byChun and his family.   The travel ban followed a resolution passed Aug. 4 by a specialNational Assembly committee in a move to force the former presidentto testify about corruption under his administration.   Ministry officials said Chun and his wife were excluded from thetravel ban as they deserved due courtesy. Chun left office inFebruary at the end of a seven-year term.   Among Chun's 14 relatives subject to the ban were Chun's twobrothers, a father-in-law and several brothers-in-law and theirwives. All 14 are under investigation for alleged corruption.   The opposition has denounced Chun and his family overallegations of widespread corruption and financial scandals. Chun'syounger brother, Chun Kyong-hwan, is on trial on charges ofembezzling millions of dollars in his former position as head of arural development group.   The opposition wants the ex-president to testify before theopposition-controlled assembly about the allegations, but PresidentRoh Tae-woo's governing party opposes the idea.   A former army general, Roh played a key role in helping Chunseize power with military backing in 1980. Roh won election inDecember last year over divided opposition candidates.   Chun's wife, Lee Soon-ja, and her family have been under publicfire for alleged influence-peddling and corruption during herhusband's administration.   Also today, Roh's governing party proposed a parliamentary probeof allegations that Chun's family sent fortunes to the UnitedStates and Australia. The opposition rejected the offer, contendingit was intended to divert public attention abroad.</TEXT></DOC>
