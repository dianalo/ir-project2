The Institute of International Finance, which is based inWashington and represents about 170 banks worldwide, calledon finance ministers and central bank governors of the majorindustrialized countries to address the growing amount ofoverdue payments. It also appealed for action on the world's&quot;growing capital shortage&quot; and on the increasing tendency ofborrower nations to fail to service their obligations.</LP><TEXT>   Interest-payment arrears -- most of which are owed byArgentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Ivory Coast, Peru and Poland --have spun out of control since Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady launched the current U.S. debt strategy in March 1989.It effectively ended most new bank lending to the developingworld and swept away some established rules for financing andrescheduling the debts of hard-pressed developing nations.   Several debtor countries have turned increasingly towithholding interest payments as a way to finance themselves.The willingness of the U.S. and some other nations to forgivethe obligations of some debtor nations also is helping toproduce a climate where other hard-pressed nations arestarting to seek debt relief.</TEXT></DOC>
