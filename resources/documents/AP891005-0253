The move appeared to be aimed at curbing inflation andsupporting European currencies, which have weakened against thedollar despite concerted central bank intervention in recent days.   The widely expected announcement by the Bundesbank sent thedollar sliding. In Frankfurt, the U.S. currency dropped one pfennigto 1.8653 marks from 1.8760 in early morning trading. In London thedollar, which had risen against the pound on Wednesday, fell to$1.6165 from $1.6055.   Currency analysts said before the announcement that ahalf-percentage point increase already was factored into the marketand would not affect the dollar but that a bigger increase woulddampen the U.S. currency.   The Bundesbank set the new discount rate at 6 percent, with theLombard rate at 8 percent. It was the fourth interest-rate risethis year for the West German central bank.   Meanwhile, central banks in Britain, Austria and the Netherlandsraised their rates by 1 percent to 15 percent, 6.5 percent and 7percent respectively.   The Bank of France increased its key rate by 3@4 percent to 9.5percent, and the five to 10-day repurchase rate by the same amountto 10.25 percent. And the Swiss National Bank boosted its discountrate by a half percentage point to 6 percent.   The discount rate is the cheapest, or bottom rate at which abank can borrow funds, using treasury bills as collateral. Nearlyhalf of bank financing comes from discount rate funds in WestGermany.   The Lombard rate is the rate at which European central banksloan short-term funds using securities as collateral. It's theceiling of the money market rates. Banks normally borrow Lombardfunds only in emergency.   Bundesbank officials, in a statement released to the news media,said the rate increases, the fourth since the beginning of theyear, ``were intended to combat continued inflationary danger,''resulting from the country's strong economy.   Some commercial banks in Europe followed the central banksannouncement with rate increases of their own.</TEXT></DOC>
