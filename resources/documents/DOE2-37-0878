Experimentaldevices and operating characteristics of the total energy were comparedwith the differences in the sunlight and operating conditions takinginto consideration and solar thermoelectric power generating plants developedin Japan as example. Improvement of the system utilization was demonstratedby using the thermal energy at many temperature levels. A low temperatureloop is separately constructed in this facility so that the thermal energyat low temperatures can be collected on slightly cloudy days when directsunlight is not available. The operating conditions are described indetail. The sunlight characteristics, heat collection characteristicsof the heat collection loop and the changes in the reflection factorof mirrors are also described. Improved heat collection efficiency wasshown by arranging the pipings as short as possible and the effect ofreflection factor and the amount of sunlight on the heat collection factorare also discussed.
