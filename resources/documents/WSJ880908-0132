This action should result in a more even flow of products over time than would have occurred had current stocks been sold and not stored, thus easing the impact of the drought. The observed effect is to raise prices as soon as the reduced future flow of new products is recognized. Those fortunate enough to have stocks of products will recognize a windfall gain. However, these are pretty much the same people as those who were unfortunate enough to hold stocks when crops were unexpectedly good and prices fell sharply, when they suffered a windfall loss!    Analysis of events such as these are part of elementary economics courses, in which instructors emphasize that historical cost is and should be irrelevant to current decisions, which must be based on current and expected future alternatives.
