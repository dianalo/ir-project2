Anexhibition of Gruau's work, priced from $700 to $4,000, brought theVenetian-born artist to the San Francisco gallery for a reception last Fridayevening.;    Unlike some artists who have no use for photographs, Gruaubelieves both fulfill a need. &quot;A photo is more real. You can see the texture,the girl, the makeup -- you see everything. But maybe a drawing gives a moreartistic vision of the dress.;    &quot;I've never been against photographs, butwhen it's good, a drawing can be more effective,&quot; he says.;    A look atGruau's illustrations over the years, such as one he did for Christian Diorstockings in 1960, proves his point. In that particular drawing, a black catis insinuating itself around two long, endless legs, evoking a sensuous aurathat a photograph could never capture.;    Harper's Bazaar summed up Gruau asa &quot;visual poet . . . whose style is as evanescent and luminous as the flare ofa match.&quot;;    In 1989 Gruau had a retrospective exhibition at the PalaisGalleria Museum in Paris, which is now on exhibit through March 20 at theFashion Institute of Technology in New York and will travel in 1992 to theVictoria and Albert Museum in London.;    A true diplomat, Gruau hesitates tosingle out any designer as his favorite, demurring, &quot;They're all friends ofmine, or were when they were alive.&quot;;    Pressed, he says, &quot;I was a greatfriend of Dior personally and I am still a great friend of Givenchy and St.Laurent, but to me the greatest of all was Balenciaga. But the others are verygreat too, especially Dior, Givenchy and St. Laurent.&quot;;    As for the state offashion today, Gruau will name no names, but does say, &quot;I don't think it's avery good period for fashion right now. Maybe it will come back, but somedesigners want to be spectacular and want to make the press talk about themmore than they want to make a woman look prettier.&quot;; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; Theexhibition of Rene Gruau lithographs continues through April 1 at the CircleGallery, 140 Maiden Lane, San Francisco. Hours are 10 a.m.-6 p.m.Monday-Saturday and 12:30-5:30 p.m. Sundays.
