The majority will rule,'' he said.   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., chairman of the House DemocraticCaucus, predicted their would be ``no pay raise, no change'' in thelawmakers' $89,500 salary.   Wright, D-Texas, made the announcement from the House floor afteropponents of the $45,500 increase won a key procedural vote on thesubject, defeating an effort by the Democratic leadership to adjournthe House until Tuesday.   An attempt to adjourn is normally such a routine procedure thatit does not require a roll call vote. But in this case one wasordered, and its rejected on a 238-88 vote that showed opponentsheld the upper hand.   The pay raise is scheduled to take effect at 12:01 a.m. onWednesday. The Senate already has voted against the raise.   The vote and Wright's subsequent announcement came after MajorityLeader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., who was presiding over the day's Housesession, refused to recognize a pay-raise opponent who wanted tointroduce a resolution calling for a vote on the hike.   That set the stage for more than 30 minutes of barbed debatebetween the two sides.   Rep. Arthur S. Ravenel, R-S.C., said the House was engaging in a``shameful pay raise conspiracy'' by taking a money without votingfor it.   But Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., accused unnamed House members of``hypocrisy'' by speaking out publicly against the raise andindicating privately that they wanted the money.   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she was going to be watchingpublic opponents of the raise carefully to see whether they pocketthe money. ``I hope the press will be watching,'' added Rep. JohnDingell, D-Mich.   The proposed congressional pay is part of a package that wouldincrease the salaries of federal judges as well as senior officialsand managers in the executive branch. For members of the House andthe Senate, the increase would amount to a raise from $89,500 to$135,000 a year.   It was not immediately clear whether the vote that Wright set forTuesday would affect the recommended increases for judges andadministration officials.   Wright's decision to order the vote capped a remarkable retreatfor the speaker.   As recently as last week he insisted there would be no vote onthe pay raise. He attempted to lessen the political damage byspreading the word that the House would vote swiftly on legislationthat would ban payment for honoraria for speeches and impose othercurtailments on outside compensation.   Later in the week, he conducted a private survey of House membersand said the results showed they did not want a vote before theraise took effect. Despite that, random surveys by The AssociatedPress and other organizations showed that sentiment was in favor ofa vote.   By late last week, Wright had said he would seek to scale the 50percent pay raise back to 30 percent while banning honoraria.   Throughout the maneuvering, House Republican leaders lent theirsilent support to Wright's efforts to avoid a vote. Minority LeaderRobert Michel, R-Ill., sat silently in his seat on the House floorduring today's debate and vote.   The Senate voted 95-5 last Thursday to reject the entire raisefor Congress and other top federal officials, but it will become lawautomatically Wednesday under a special procedure unless the Housealso turns it down.   The raise would apply to Congress, top Bush administrationpolitical appointees and judges, but the Constitution preventsreduction of judges' pay once they receive a raise.   Under Wright's proposal to let the raise become law,rank-and-file lawmakers would see their salaries rise Wednesday from$89,500 to $135,000. The speaker's plan would scale that back to$116,350.   The Senate already has voted to offset the 51 percent raisepartially by banning honoraria while the higher pay is in effect.The House plans to pass its own package to ban speaking fees andlimit other outside income.   Public reaction to the congressional pay raise has beenoverwhelmingly negative. Dozens of protesters shouting ``No payhike,'' ``Read our lips'' and ``Hey Mr. Speaker, haven't you heard,50 percent is quite absurd,'' Sunday night met Democratic Housemembers returning to Union Station from a weekend retreat at theluxurious Greenbrier resort in West Virginia.   The lawmakers had earlier wondered aloud whether any strategywould satisfy the public _ and let them keep a pay raise.   ``It'll sort of be like Andy Warhol said: We'll be rich for 15minutes,'' said Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y.   While lawmakers wrestle with their own pay this week, they'llalso be working on solutions to protect the money that millions ofAmericans have in shaky savings and loans. About 350 insolvent Sandamp;Lsremain operating after regulators ``rescued'' 205 last year withpromissory notes and loss guarantees.   Bush met over the weekend with his top advisers on the Sandamp;L issue,and while he gave no clue to his intentions, administrationofficials said an announcement could come early this week.   The Senate Armed Services Committee, meanwhile, is expected tovote by midweek on the nomination of former Sen. John G. Tower to besecretary of defense. The vote will take place after the panelreceives an FBI report on what congressional sources say are newallegations of drinking and womanizing by the Texas Republican.   The 51 percent pay raise for Congress and executive branchpolitical appointees could remain in effect for some time if the twohouses are unable to resolve their differences.   Wright emphasized last week that his 30 percent rollback wouldn'tbe an increase at all _ but a dollar-for-dollar tradeoff _ for Housemembers who have been pocketing the honoraria maximum of $26,850 _30 percent of salary. A Common Cause study showed that 108 Housemembers were at or near the limit in 1987.   While the 51 percent raise is law, House members giving up themaximum honoraria would gain $18,650 a year in the trade. Sincesenators have been allowed to retain 40 percent of their salary inhonoraria _ $35,800 _ those at the maximum would gain $9,700annually from the full raise.</TEXT></DOC>
