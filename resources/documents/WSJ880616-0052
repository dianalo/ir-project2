Belmont Industries Inc., the suitor, is controlled by Raymond G. Perelman, who is chairman, president and chief executive officer at General. Belmont and affiliates hold 47.6% of General's nearly 3.6 million shares outstanding. At March 31, General had $11.3 million of long-term debt outstanding.    Refractory products resist heat; General makes and installs such things as bricks for kilns. The Audobon, Pa., company also has minerals and other interests. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, General's shares rose $4.375, to $21.75.    Mr. Perelman wasn't available to discuss why Belmont is proposing the takeover.    A committee of General's independent directors will review the proposal, which is subject to approval by General's board and holders. </TEXT></DOC>
