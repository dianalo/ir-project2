Washington has been pressuring Japan since early this year to loosen restrictions on its market for international value-added networks, or VANs, which allow computers to communicate over phone lines. U.S. officials have warned Japan that the dispute could become the first test of the new trade bill signed last week by President Reagan, which makes it easier for the U.S. to apply trade sanctions against foreign countries.    The issue is complex. An expert at one U.S. company says that negotiators on both sides don't really understand the technologies involved and are basically just beating their chests. The underlying conflict appears to be as philosophical as it is technical. &quot;There is absolute solidarity in Washington&quot; on the issue, says John Stern, executive director of the U.S. Electronics Industry Japan Office, a trade group. &quot;The Japanese don't realize they're sitting on a powder keg.&quot;    VANs are used increasingly for such services as computer mail boxes, which store computer messages sent over a phone line. The posturing is over Japan's requirement that vendors of international VAN services use a standard protocol -- the set of rules that determine how computers respond to each other in the network. Simply put, if network A wants to connect to network B but speaks a different internal language, both A and B need a common protocol to communicate.    The telecom ministry wants vendors to use a protocol called X.75, which was developed by the International Telecommunications Union, or ITU, an international standard setting body. The U.S., which permits both standard and proprietary protocols to flourish within its borders, says let the market decide.    U.S. companies, which lead in VAN technologies and often have built networks around their own unique protocols, say Japan's restrictions impede them. International Business Machines Corp., in particular, has developed its networks, and the extremely complex software that runs them, based on their own proprietary protocols. The Japanese position &quot;will deprive {U.S. vendors} of a competitive advantage they have gained through years of experience and significant investments in their networks and protocols,&quot; says Paul W. Sage, chairman of the American Electronics Association's industry committee in Japan.    But without a minimal protocol standard, says Yasushi Yoshida, a Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications official overseeing data communications, Japan wouldn't be able to maintain order in the market and wouldn't be able to persuade other nations to open their markets to international VANs with Japan. &quot;We simply can't agree to complete freedom&quot; in the market, he says.    The dispute is a classic confrontation between market philosophies. Washington believes that Japan profits from free U.S. markets and should reciprocate with completely free Japanese markets. Tokyo government bureaucrats claim to favor free markets; in practice they often are loath to relinquish complete control, especially in promising industries.    In fact, technological hurdles to trade are an issue here. Demanding a standard protocol means requiring vendors to create new software for their networks, a costly, time intensive process. For example, it took General Electric Technical Services, a unit of General Electric Co., 18 months to tailor the X.75 protocol standard to its network. That development period can give the Japanese time to catch up with U.S. technology.    U.S. negotiators have been pressing the telecommunications ministry to tear down its barriers ever since Japan agreed to open its telecommunications markets in 1985. Last year, the ministry agreed to allow companies to start international VAN business between the U.S. and Japan, but required them to use X.75. The telecommunications ministry says it might also allow the X.25 protocol, which contains rules by which data is sent over a line, but lacks certain sophisticated X.75 functions.    International VANs are a new business, so few precedents have been set by other countries. U.S. trade officials say the ITU set the X.75 protocol as a recommendation, not a requirement, and note that the ministry doesn't require the standard for VANs used within Japan's borders.    Last July the Japanese suggested a compromise: A vendor could use whatever protocol it wanted inside its network as long as the final connections offered a standard protocol. &quot;We feel we've already made a big concession,&quot; says the ministry's Mr. Yoshida.    Still, U.S.-Japan trade talks earlier this month in Hawaii didn't produce a resolution. Telecommunications Ministry officials say that U.S. trade officials hinted last week that the issue could flare into the first application of the revised section 301 of the U.S. trade law, under which the president is obligated to apply trade sanctions against a nation found by the U.S. Trade Representative to be practicing unfair trade. </TEXT></DOC>
