The new blows came on Thursday, when the Commerce Departmentreleased a report on the gross national product for the secondquarter and several central banks in Europe raised key interestrates.   The punches knocked the wind out of bond prices, sendinginterest rates higher. The Treasury's closely watched 30-year issueslumped 17-32 point, or about $5.30 for every $1,000 in face value.Its yield, often an indicator of interest rate trends, rose to 9.45percent from 9.40 percent late Wednesday.   ``There's no doubt that both elements were negative,'' saidWilliam Sullivan, director of money-market research at Dean WitterReynolds Inc., referring to the GNP report and the European ratehikes.   The GNP data showed that the U.S. economy expanded at a robustannual rate of 3.3 percent from April through June despite thesevere impact of the drought on farm production. That was up froman earlier estimate of 3.1 percent.   But what really hurt bond prices in the report was a GNP priceindex indicating that inflation accelerated. The index rose at anannual rate of 5.1 percent during the second quarter, the sharpestincrease since a 5.8 percent rise in the third quarter of 1982.   The GNP figures indicated ``that the economy is expanding muchtoo rapidly and inflation will become more of a problem later on,''said Marshall Front, an economist for Stein Roe andamp; Farnham, aninvestment firm in Chicago.   Evidence of accelerating inflation raises fear that the FederalReserve could put the brakes on the economy by tightening creditand forcing interest rates higher.   That's what the Fed did in a dramatic move on Aug. 9, announcinga half-percentage point increase in its discount rate to combatinflation. That put the fee the Fed charges member banks forshort-term loans at 6.5 percent, its highest level in more than twoyears.   It was the first rise in the key rate since September 1987 _ themonth preceding the stock market crash _ and sparked a half-pointincrease in the U.S. prime lending rate to 10 percent.   The ripples sent out by the Fed's discount-rate hike turned intowaves this past Thursday, when the central banks of West Germanyand Britain raised key interest rates. The moves were quicklymatched by France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Austria.   West Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said it raised itsdiscount rate in order to stem the dollar's rise against the mark.British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the baselending rate was boosted to keep domestic inflation under control.   The coordinated European actions, viewed as a ``catch-up'' tothe rise in the U.S. discount rate, rekindled fears of a worldinterest-rate spiral and dealt another body blow to bond prices.   ``It reminded people that the course of global rates may stillbe in an upward direction,'' said Dean Witter's Sullivan.   The double whammy came when the bond market was just recoveringfrom its pummeling two weeks earlier by the discount-rate increase.The unexpected rate boost wreaked havoc on the three quarterlyauctions of Treasury securities that followed the move.   Now, bond traders are looking ahead anxiously to upcomingreports on the economy for an indication of what course the Fedmight take. A critical set of data, the report on the nation'sunemployment in August, will arrive on Friday of the coming week.   Some analysts believe the Fed could push the discount rate stillhigher. Other experts, though, think the central bank would beloathe to take such drastic action again so close to thepresidential election in November. Instead, they expect the centralbank to nudge rates gently higher by using routine operations suchas playing on the federal funds rate, the interest on overnightloans between banks.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Aug. 27-28</NOTE></DOC>
