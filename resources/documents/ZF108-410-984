 But of late, we had become acutely aware that we werewalking around with a bum ticker.andP;  So when a link on the bracelet gave way,we brought the old timer to the shop for an overhaul.andP;  Estimated charge forrepairs: $255.47.andP;  A Rolex emphatically asserts that time is money.andP;  Nextstop, Chinatown.andP;  Canal Street is where New Yorkers shop for cheap watchesthat look an awful lot like expensive ones.andP;  It is lined with uniformtimepiece boutiques, each consisting of a bridge table strewn withbaubles.Two or three technicians are required to manage each tiny enterprise.andO;The taipan handles negotiations from behind the table.andP;  Number two patrolsthe street side of the establishment; most likely armed and certainly fleetof foot, he attempts to foil the ever-present shoplifters.andP;  The optionalthird player keeps watch for representatives of the government, who justmight want to license or tax the entrepreneurs out of business.andP;  Allcollaborate in locating prey like us.andM;HondlingandM;We were prepared for this.andP;  Having observed a trade with similar practicesfor many years, our next step was obvious.andP;  We tried to differentiate amongdozens of nearly-identical machines priced at radically different and oftenpreposterous levels by individuals we did not trust any farther than we couldheave a Bosendorfer.andP;  The three best choices were all ersatz diver's models.andO;Least appealing among them was a $23 Hong Kong fake with a quartz movement.andO;Bad look and feel.andP;  For five bucks more, we were offered a Taiwanese unit,also using quartz technology, that was much more carefully finished.andP;  But itticked every second, while our genuine but temporarily disabled mechanicalRolex had a sweep hand that appeared to move continuously.andP;  The winner was awatch with a Taiwanese case and a Japanese self-winding 21-jewel movement.andO;Alas, it cost $50, and then only after a buyer vigorously participated in theprice-adjustment ritual Oriental merchants call hondling.andP;  Later that day, werealised the watch was showing the wrong date.andP;  In our haste to reset it, weunscrewed and pulled out the winding stem with unaccustomed vigour -unaccustomed by the watch, that is.andP;  The gizmo popped right out into ourhand.andP;  The next day, we went back to Chinatown, intent on upbraiding thevendor and getting a different timepiece.andP;  To our dismay, but not entirely toour surprise, where once dwelled a bustling tabletop jewellery shop there wasnow only a vacant patch of sidewalk.andP;  Our connection to the far Pacific hadtaken on the character of users' ties to Atlantic Computers Plc.andP;  Yes, evenon Canal Street, boulevard of shrewd and cynical survivors, businesses cannotlive on borrowed time - which Atlantic had done for years.andP;  It is also whatother now-defunct lessors had done in the past.andP;  And it will happen again,eventually, leaving customers and investors in the lurch.andP;  If there is alesson here, it isn't one that's confined to computer leasing.andP;  -andM;By Hesh WienerandM;For even though Atlantic's failure occurred in that trade, the company'sunravelling was not a consequence of its speciality.andP;  Rather, the demise ofAtlantic is just an instance, a case in which a company couldn't get awaywith unsound and unethical practices forever.andP;  Atlantic's financial sins areendemic to the whole realm of finance.andP;  They are a common, unwanted sideeffect of prosperity.andP;  During every business boom, there are operators thatride markets upward, convincing investors that their speculation in realestate, stocks and bonds, computers or commodities is the result of brilliantinsight and masterful strategy.andP;  These players may be hard to distinguishfrom similarly inclined, competent and legitimate participants.andP;  Sometimesthe bunco artists seem more appealing than the straight shooters.andP;  The lessthe observer knows about the nitty-gritty of a particular financialspeciality, the more effective are scoundrels' acts of illusion.andP;  In thefullness of time, however, the villains often get their due.andP;  Eventually,business conditions grow more arduous.andP;  And when the wheel of fortune turns,these schemers are wiped out, taking their investors along with them.andO;Computer leasing is only one business that's going through a difficultperiod, and probably not the most significant.andP;  US real estate these days isa house of cards.andP;  The losses are so devastating that the government hasstepped in.andP;  It is trying to pay for the mass looting of savings and loaninstitutions by fools and knaves.andP;  It has taken out a 40-year bond-backedmortgage on the Second Great Depression.andP;  Last we looked, the Administrationwas trying to get the Japanese and Germans to buy this peculiar deal anddiscovering to its dismay that neither had a yen to be a mark.andP;  Computerlessors often use a pint-sized version of this strategy to bridge downturnslike the current one.andP;  They roll their problems forward, using front-endprofits from current transactions to pay for back-end losses on prior dealsthat went sour.andP;  This is not a strategy confined to incompetent leasingcompanies.andP;  Even the best lessors must weather trying times every so often.andM;PreposterousandM;But a strong lessor will ride out the storm that causes weak ones to capsize.andO;When good times return, the survivors will prosper all the more because theywill have fewer competitors putting pressure on profit margins.andP;  In addition,customers favour time-tested leasing companies.andP;  Even in good seasons, thecomputer leasing business has some peculiar characteristics.andP;  To begin with,the very idea of fighting IBM for a dollar is, on the surface, preposterous.andO;IBM gets machines wholesale and sells or leases them at retail.andP;  Thirdparties buy them at retail and then have to market them at wholesale.andO;Nonetheless, computer dealers and lessors have, in the main, prospered.andP;  Mostlessees don't appreciate just how fundamentally sound the computer leasingtrade is, just as they never seem to learn that it is cyclic.andP;  They confuseleasing's volatility with fragility.andP;  They don't seem to realise that IBMcannot destroy the leasing business without causing itself great harm.andO;Customers - however great their investments in software - do not like beingat the mercy of a monopoly.andP;  It's difficult enough for them to accept thedominance of a single supplier, however earnest.andP;  But the prospect of havingonly one place to sell unwanted equipment is too much for users to bear.andO;Eventually, they would bolt.andP;  So the leasing business will survive - andwithin it not only the well-run firms but some that play fast and loose withothers' funds.andP;  There will always be customers who don't realize that a dealthat seems too good to be true probably isn't.andP;  But just as surely, therewill be prudent lessees who will direct their trade to worthy lessors.andP;  Theseusers won't have to hear the words of a bankruptcy trustee presented with apre-petition obligation that will no longer be honoured - coincidentally, thesame words used by a peddler on Canal Street asked to take a broken timepiecein trade: &quot;It wasn't on my watch.&quot;Copyright (C) 1990 Technology News ofAmerica Co Inc.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
