Dan Mahoney, general counsel for the Seattle ProfessionalEngineering Employees Association, said negotiations concludedThursday night between Boeing's second-largest union and thecompany, which is the world's biggest commercial aircraftmanufacturer.   He said negotiators agreed ``to transmit the company's offer tothe membership'' without endorsement.   Mahoney would not give details of the contract other than to sayit contains ``a lot of significant improvements.''   The engineers' union represents nearly 28,000 Boeing workers,with nearly all its members in the Seattle area. It has been intalks to reach a new three-year contract since Oct. 17.   ``What the negotiators did was to virtually rewrite two verylong and complex collective bargaining agreements,'' said WaltBaer, the union's executive director and chief negotiator.   One agreement, he said, covers more than 15,000 engineers andscientists, and the second affects more than 12,000 technicalemployees.   Members of Boeing's largest union, the International Associationof Machinists and Aerospace Workers, ratified a three-year contracton Nov. 20, ending a 48-day strike.   The Machinists' new contract included annual wage increases of 4percent the first year, 3 percent the second and 3 percent thethird, a cost-of-living formula to account for virtually allinflation, plus bonuses of 10 percent the first year, 5 percent thesecond and 4 percent the third.   Engineers' union negotiators agreed to the vote at about 9 p.m.Thursday, three hours before the contract was to expire.   The union originally sought a 35 percent salary boost over threeyears, but later scaled back demands.   Neither the union nor Boeing released details of the offer.   ``The only thing I can give you is that the talks concluded,''Boeing corporate spokesman Paul Binder said. ``We are pleased thatthey have reached a conclusion and we look forward to a favorablevote by the membership.''   Mahoney said the union was going to try to withhold release ofdetails until a Dec. 10 membership meeting at the Seattle Coliseum.The union will vote by mail on the contract offer, with ballots tobe counted Dec. 18, he said.   The union has never struck Boeing. Under its contract, itsmembers were required to continue working through the machinists'strike.</TEXT></DOC>
