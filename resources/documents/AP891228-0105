Juan Ponce Enrile be prosecuted foralleged involvement in the latest attempt to overthrow PresidentCorazon Aquino, an official said.   Enrile, a former Aquino supporter, denied involvement in thecoup attempt, saying the accusations wer meant to harass theopposition. He said he welcomed the opportunity to face hisaccusers in court.   Fernando de Leon, the chief state prosecutor, said the NationalBureau of Investigation recommended prosecution after witnessesclaimed to have seen Enrile with mutiny leaders Dec. 1, whenthousands of troops launched the sixth and strongest attempt totopple Mrs. Aquino.   De Leon said government prosecutors would review therecommendation to decide whether charges would be filed.   Enrile joined with Mrs. Aquino in the military-civilian uprisingthat swept her to power in February 1986. He was named as defenseminister but fired from the post that November after a failed coupby his followers.   De Leon said those reportedly seen with Enrile at his homeincluded former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, believed tohave been a key leader in the failed coup attempt.   De Leon said the witnesses were hotel waiters catering a meal atEnrile's Makati residence.   Enrile denied that there were soldiers at his residence. He saidhe had ``not more than 20'' bodyguards, all in civilian dress.   He said there also were some guests attending a Mass customarilyheld at his house on the first Friday of every month.   ``I know that I have not done anything that is criminal underour laws,'' Enrile said. ``I am not part of the rebellion. I havenot seen any of the participants in this military rebellion.''   He called the accusations a ``machination'' of the presidentialpalace.   ``They want to seal the lips of the opposition in the countryand to threaten them, but I will tell them now ... that they cannotsilence me,'' Enrile said. ``This government is like a woundedtiger flailing its paws.''   In all, 113 people were killed and more than 500 wounded in theDec. 1-9 coup attempt.   Many of the coup leaders, including Honasan, are at large.   Government institutions bought stocks Thursday to easepanic-selling on the Manila Stock Exchange. Dealers blamed astatement Wednesday by Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, chief of thePhilippine Constabulary, that intelligence reports indicated a coupattempt may be launched between Jan. 17 and Jan. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
