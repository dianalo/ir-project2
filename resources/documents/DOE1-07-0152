Theimages were interpreted with the planar scintigram (PS) only and combinationof PS and SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) by 11 physicians.Changes of false positive and false negative rate were calculated toevaluate the influence of the diffuse parenchymal liver disease and thelocalization of the SOLs. Addition of SPECT to PS in the cases who aresuspected SOLs is effective in right hepatic lobe (right anterior andposterior segment) to detect the SOLs, but not effective in left lateralsegment. Addition of SPECT to PS in the cases with diffuse parenchymalliver disease and SOLs increases the false positive rate.</TEXT></DOC>
