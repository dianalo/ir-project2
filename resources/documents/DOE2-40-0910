The composition of diesel exhaust was delineatedand areas for additional studies of possible health effects were identified.Studies have demonstrated that some of the components of diesel exhaustcause mutations in microorganisms and cancer in animals. Health effectsranging from eye irritation to respiratory disease in humans have beenreported. According to the authors, NIOSH cannot definitively affirmor condemn the use of diesel equipment in underground-mining operationsat this time. Exposures should be kept below the Mine Safety and HealthAdministration standards, or NIOSH recommended exposure limits.</TEXT></DOC>
