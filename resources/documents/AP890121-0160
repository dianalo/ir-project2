The Fed's unanimous decision this past week authorizing fivelarge banks to underwrite corporate debt addressed one of the keyelements of rules designed to reduce risks identified as a cause ofbank failures during the Depression.   Limits set by the Fed will prevent banks from challenging thedominance of big Wall Street securities firms in the near future.However, the decision eventually will lead to increased competitionand pinch the profitablity of debt underwriting, analysts say.   Historical banking functions were separated from securitiesbusinesses by the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, but in modern times theline between the two has blurred as banks have been permitted tobroaden their activities and investment houses have createdbank-like services, such as money-market accounts that work likechecking accounts.   The ensuing turf battle has featured brokerages complaining aboutbanks encroaching on their territory while the banks argue thattimes have changed and they should be free to participate in theworldwide trend toward ``universal'' banking, which has led to thecreation of financial conglomerates offering a wide range ofservices.   Even though the Fed's move greatly expands the type ofunderwriting banks may do, it places low limits on the quantity ofunderwriting.   Also, responding to concerns about concentrating too much poweramong banks, the Fed spelled out how banks engaging in underwritingmust structure their operations. Generally, the parent bank mustrefrain from involving itself too closely in operations ofsecurities affiliates.   Debt underwriting is a crucial link in the process of raisingmoney for businesses. Corporations selling bonds depend onunderwriters to purchase them and then resell them to the public.   For acting as a marketer in this way, underwriters collect feesthat in recent years have been shrinking as other financing methodshave gained more widespread use.   Last year, the value of new corporate debt registered with theSecurities and Exchange Commission and sold to the public totaledabout $100 billion, industry estimates show.   On deals lately, an underwriter can expect to make about $7.50per $1,000 of face value of a long-term bond issue. So, of a $100million bond issue, the underwriter's share would be $750,000, minusexpenses, typically netting the underwriter $500,000.   Robert Judge, a vice president in the bond trading department ofNikko Securities Co. International, said that as a result of theFed's decision, underwriters might have to settle for smallerspreads as more competitors vie for a share of the business.   The five banks given debt underwriting authorization also hadasked the Fed for permission to sell new issues of stock, but thecentral bank withheld that power for a year, pending a review of thebanks' activities.   The five banks are: Bankers Trust New York Corp., Chase ManhattanCorp., Citicorp, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. and Security Pacific Corp.   John J. Kriz, senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service, saidbanks will not make much of a dent in the debt underwriting businessof the giants that handle most U.S. deals.   ``In the long term, it signifies a trend toward universalbanking, which is what we already have in most European financialcenters,'' he said, adding that in the future it will ``put severepressure on profits.''   From the view of big money-center banks, the Fed's latest movewas significant only so far as it was part of the evolution of theindustry's financial powers.   It enables them to provide a service in the United States thatsome already have experience with in the Eurobond market. Judging bythe somewhat unimpressive record of U.S. banks in underwriting debtoverseas, one banking analyst who asked that his name not be usedsaid the Fed's decision ``won't amount to a hill of beans.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Jan. 21-22</NOTE></DOC>
