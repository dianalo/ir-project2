Since the violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip began,Israeli viewers only once saw troops beat protesters and rarely seepictures of Arabs wounded by gunfire. TV anchors often refer to thesituation as ``relatively quiet.''   By contrast, TV viewers in the United States often see soldiersbeating Arab protesters and Palestinians who have been wounded orkilled by gunfire.   After nearly three months of violence, U.N. figures show 74Arabs have died in rioting, mostly by Israeli gunfire.   There appear to be three reasons for the low-key coverage inIsrael: concerns that too much publicity will encourage Arabprotesters and spark more violence; ``patriotic journalism,'' orthe reluctance to report stories that weaken the morale ofsoldiers, and, in some cases, official censorship.   ``If I compare the reports we are getting from around the worldto what the Israeli people are watching, it looks like we aretalking about two different places,'' said Israel Peleg, a formermember of the Israel Broadcast Authority's board of directors.   The Israel Broadcast Authority which runs television and radiobarred this reporter from interviewing broadcast journalists.   But Yair Stern, head of the TV's news division, said thecoverage was considered too critical by many Israelis. ``If theaction is tough, we get up to 100 calls a night, most from peoplewho say they don't want to see this or want us to be more favorableto the government,'' he said.   Stern rejected charges that TV intentionally soft-pedaled badnews. He acknowledged the station had only once shown soldiersbeating Palestinians, but cited as the reason lack of footage, notcensorship.   The footage of the only beating shown was provided by CBStelevision and showed soldiers kicking and hitting with rocks twobound Arabs in the West Bank city of Nablus last week.   But Israeli editors cut the most gruesome scenes, including onein which a soldier who seemed to be breaking the arms of one of theArabs.   Israel radio quoted Uri Porat, the director-general of theIsrael Broadcast Authority, as saying the scenes were deletedbecause of a television ban on showing atrocities and because someviewers might not be mature enough to deal with such images.   In defending the coverage, Stern said Israel TV tried to presentlonger background pieces, while American networks ``collect thehighlight of action from here and there, and then wrap it up in 50seconds. That's why the impression in America is of violence, andonly violence.''   But several Israeli print journalists rejected thoseexplanations. Israeli newspapers cover the Arab protests much moreaggressively than television and radio, and have broken severalstories about army brutality, including an incident in whichsoldiers allegedly buried alive four Arabs after a protest.   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper described the television and radiocoverage as ``vegetarian, sterile.''   ``They have this long-winded piece that there were disturbances,and then you hear five people were badly wounded,'' said Ari Rath,managing editor of the English-language Jerusalem Post.   In an editorial, he complained of a ``new clean language byIsrael's radio and television that calls major clashes betweencivilians and troops ... mere `disturbances.'''   Rath said he didn't know of widespread official censorship butsaid some broadcast journalists apparently held back on their own.``In part, it could be a subconscious self-defense to anincreasingly embarrassing and painful situation,'' Rath said. ``Youtry not to call a spade a spade.''   Peleg, a former director of the government press office, added:``The self-restraint in Israel TV has reached a point where thereis no need for censorship or political interference.''</TEXT></DOC>
