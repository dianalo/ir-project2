Besides its technicalproblems, the raw coal combustion is problematic with the occurrenceof pollution. To confront it, following the use of coal mixture, etc.,the CCS using fine ground coal cartbidge for the boiler, etc. was plannedto widely promote the coal utilization and started to be put to practicaluse. By the CCS, problems pertaining to the stock coal, coal dust, coalcinder, etc. were solved with no longer necessitating grinding machines.COM, for the plan to effectively utilize the existing facilities andsave the heavy oil consumption, is slurry, utilizable equivalently toheavy oil and transportable by means of pipeline. Also, the operationof power stations using COM has already commenced. Non-petroleum CWM,mostly taken notice of at present, on account of the advantage and safetyin storage and treatment processes, and lowness in pollution, is beingput to practical use. While MCM, though having various merit, is problematicwith the price for methanol. (1 fig, 4 tabs, 27 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
