Weasked three men and a computer.   Holding their breath for good luck, all of theparticipants sprinkled their lists with cyclical stocks.Cyclicals rise and fall with the tides of the economy -- anduntil Dec. 20, when the Federal Reserve Board lowered theinterest rates drastically -- they had mostly been falling.</LP><TEXT>   Even after the spirited year-end rally, cyclical stocksare inexpensive compared with many others. Some stocks, suchas biotechnology stocks, are selling at &quot;very high values,mania values,&quot; says David Dreman, managing partner of DremanValue Management in New York. But &quot;the cyclicals are prettycheap.&quot;   People who worry too much about the economy or the DowJones Industrial Average &quot;will miss a great year inindividual stocks,&quot; says James H. Morgan, president ofInterstate/Johnson Lane, a regional brokerage in Charlotte,N.C.   Mr. Morgan's selections in this space a year ago rose51.1% (including dividends) through Dec. 10. His biggestgains were 151% in Home Depot Inc. and 96.6% in HealthdyneInc. TW Holdings lost 4%, but Mr. Morgan recommends it againthis year.   TW has $4 billion in sales from its Denny's and Quincy'sFamily Steakhouse restaurants, Canteen food serviceoperation, and Hardee's restaurant franchises, but it hasbeen posting losses. TW has about $1 billion in debt atfloating interest rates, which lately have declined. Given&quot;even a mild recovery,&quot; Mr. Morgan thinks TW will beprofitable by the fourth quarter.   Mr. Morgan and his colleagues think a major trend will be&quot;outsourcing&quot; of some operations by big corporations. Thiswould help SCI Systems, which makes electronics and computerparts, including the newfangled double-sided circuit boards.It is &quot;making money in spite of punk conditions,&quot; he says.Similarly, Intermet, a large foundry, serves the depressedauto industry, yet should show a dime-a-share profit for1991. In a good year, Mr. Morgan says it could earn $1.50 ashare. The stock ended the year at $7.375.   Interstate/Johnson Lane's researchers are sweet onRuddick, a neighbor in Charlotte. The small conglomerate getsmost of its revenue from the grocery chain Harris Teeter. &quot;Ifthe company were called Harris Teeter,&quot; the stock price wouldbe higher, says Mr. Morgan, who figures that investors getthe other operations (American andamp; Efird industrial sewingthread and Jordan Graphics) essentially for free.   Finally, Mr. Morgan likes Durr-Fillauer, a medicalsupplies distributor he believes will grow 20% a year, partlythrough acquisitions that the company can fund with its&quot;great balance sheet.&quot;   Mr. Dreman, whose picks in this space a year ago rose35.4%, favors a quintet of battered stocks for the new year.&quot;Woolworth has really been knocked down&quot; as retail sales havebeen weak not only in the U.S. but also in Germany andCanada, two other countries where Woolworth has a bigpresence. Now that the stock has fallen from $36 to about$26.50, Mr. Dreman thinks it's a bargain.   Compaq Computer was hit even harder, falling from $74.25to a recent $26.375. &quot;There is tremendous price-cutting&quot; inthe personal-computer industry, Mr. Dreman says, and yet&quot;Compaq is still making a little money.&quot; He thinks it has&quot;the potential of surprising with earnings on the upside.&quot;   In a daring pick, Mr. Dreman puts in a good word forColumbia Gas System, which is operating under Chapter 11 ofthe Bankruptcy Code. Within a year Mr. Dreman says he thinksColumbia can settle its disputes with suppliers overlong-term contracts under which Columbia was obligated to paya high price for gas it distributes.   Rounding out his list are Scott Paper, &quot;another cyclicalthat's been beaten up,&quot; and American Express, which he sayshas tightened up standards for issuing its Optima credit cardand &quot;plugged most of the holes&quot; at its Shearson LehmanBrothers brokerage house.   Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis forA.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis says he would wait fora market pullback in January or February before buyingstocks. &quot;The dramatic runup in the market since AlanGreenspan played Santa Claus has overcelebrated&quot; the eventualrecovery of economies in the U.S. and abroad, he says. &quot;TheChristmas eggnog is going to lead into a New Year'shangover.&quot;   As the economy recovers, he thinks AMR, parent of AmericanAirlines, will soar. &quot;The contraction in the industry leavesus with close to a monopoly,&quot; he says. As a technicalanalyst, Mr. Goldman likes AMR's &quot;on-balance volume.&quot; Tradingvolume has been higher when the stock has been rising thanwhen it has been falling.   The same indicator draws him to CML Group, which makesNordic track exercise equipment. CML is also a retailer,selling men's and women's clothes, exercise equipment,nature-related gifts, craft kits and collectibles.   Mr. Goldman calls Genzyme &quot;one of the few biotechs withreal earnings. He isn't fazed that the stock, $58.75 at yearend, was recently selling for more than 200 times the pastfour quarters' earnings, because he expects the earnings toskyrocket.   To complete his list, Mr. Goldman selects National HealthLaboratories (&quot;one of the groups I want to be in is healthcare&quot;) and Waste Management (&quot;an industry that I think isvery attractive both here and in Europe&quot;).   Finally, the MacroWorld computer program gets its picks.The program is sold by Black River Systems Corp. inWinston-Salem, N.C. Douglas Graham, president, says theprogram searches reams of economic data to create a formulafor the normal price of a stock. If the actual price is wellbelow the formula price, the stock is a buy.   Here's what's really unusual: The factors aren'tcompany-specific items like earnings or dividends. Forexample, the formula for Compaq (the program's top choice for1992) is the reciprocal of the Swedish exchange rate, plus aconstant times the price of corn futures, minus anotherconstant times U.S. retail sales. Why would corn futures andthe value of the Swedish krona predict the value of Compaq?Mr. Graham doesn't know, but says &quot;through the years {theprogram} has done quite well with Compaq. It tends to ride upand down quite a bit.&quot;   MacroWorld is keen on Wells Fargo, which is depressed onfears about the U.S. banking system in general and Californiareal estate in particular. The microcircuits are also drawnto Edison Brothers Stores, AST Research, and Lukens. For mostof these stocks, MacroWorld predicts a 15%-25% rise, with atleast a 70% probability that the stock will advance in 1992.   ---                    Picks for the New Year                                                                                                          James H.
