(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York's highest court ruled today that apartner in a long-term homosexual relationship can take over thecouple's rent-controlled apartment when the lover who signed thelease dies.   In a 4-2 ruling, the Court of Appeals ordered a lower court toreconsider its decision to evict a New York City man from arent-controlled apartment he shared for a decade with his now-deadlover.   In doing so, the court expanded the definition of a ``family'' asit applies to New York's rent-control laws. The word is crucialbecause state law says only ``family members'' may take overrent-controlled apartments when the tenant of record dies.   The court said that the definition should include adults who showlong-term financial and emotional commitment to each other, even ifthey don't fit the traditional meaning of a ``family.''   Today's decision is the first time any top state court in thenation has recognized a gay couple to be the legal equivalent of afamily, according to American Civil Liberties Union lawyer WilliamRubenstein, who argued the case.   ``Today's decision is a ground-breaking victory for lesbian andgay men,'' Rubenstein said. ``It marks the most important singlestep forward in American law toward legal recognition of lesbian andgay relationships.''   The ruling comes amid growing fears within the gay communityabout housing discrimination because of AIDS. It's especiallyimportant in New York City, which has the greatest number of AIDScases in the nation and a tight housing market.   Rubenstein said the ruling would also apply to unmarriedheterosexual partners and poor families who can't afford toformalize their relationships.   ``We conclude that the term family ... should not be rigidlyrestricted to those people who have formalized their relationship byobtaining, for instance, a marriage certificate or an adoptionorder,'' Judge Vito Titone wrote.   Furthermore, Titone said that state rent-control law protectionsagainst sudden eviction ``should not rest on fictitious legaldistinctions or genetic history, but instead should find itsfoundation in the reality of family life.''</TEXT></DOC>
