Sympathizers on balconies sprinkled the sweating marchers withwater as they passed through downtown streets chanting slogansdemanding the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide be allowed to remain inHaiti.   The three-hour demonstration, like those on Thursday and Friday,began in front of the charred ruins of Aristide's St. Jean Boscochurch in a downtown slum district.   On Sept. 11, thugs with firearms and machetes entered thechurch, killed 12 parishioners, wounded 70 and set the buildingablaze.   The massacre provoked a revolt within the armed forces thatousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy on Sept. 17 and replaced him with Lt.Gen. Prosper Avril. Coup leaders said they wanted to endstate-sponsored violence and to return Haiti to democratic rule.   Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier was elected president in 1957 inwhat was considered Haiti's last fair election, and made himselfpresident-for-life in 1964. Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalierassumed the presidency upon his father's death in 1971, andremained in power until he fled to France in 1986 duringanti-government uprisings.   Namphy headed a provisional government immediately afterDuvalier went into exile, but domestic unrest and violence hasprevailed since then.   On Friday, the Rev. Guire Poulard, bishop of the southern townof Jacmel, said on the church's Radio Soleil that a solution to theissue of Aristide's transfer could be found.   ``A discussion can be held to see how we might envisage theproblem,'' he said.   Aristide, a Haitian, was an outspoken critic of Namphy'smilitary regime. He is an advocate of liberation theology, whichdemands social justice for the poor, and has been cricitized bysome Catholic leaders as promoting violence and class struggle.   Aristide announced Monday on Radio Soleil that he had received amessage from the Vatican ordering him to leave Haiti by Oct. 17.   He did not specify who issued the order, but StephaneFrancisque, a close friend, told The Associated Press the priest'sSalesian Order had told him to report to the Sainte Claire parishin Montreal.   The demonstrations Thursday and Friday attracted about 6,000supporters.   Friday's demonstration was winding down when a rumor spread thatAristide was being flown out of the country. Protesters thenbarricaded the road leading to the Port-au-Prince airport andpolice fired warning shots to disperse the crowd. One man was hitin the foot by a bullet.   In a statement read over Radio Soleil on Friday, 48 parishpriests from Port-au-Prince said Aristide ``is preaching the Gospelof Jesus Christ and the social doctrine of the Church. In thepresent context Haiti needs Rev. Aristide.''</TEXT></DOC>
