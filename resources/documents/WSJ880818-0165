The strike, organized by the leftist-led Federation of Mine, Metal and Steel Workers, began July 18, and news reports said it sparked brief metal price fluctuations in world commodity markets.    President Alan Garcia, charging strikers were being manipulated by communists seeking to destabilize the nation, threatened Sunday to declare the vital mineral industry in a state of emergency. He said the strike had cost Peru more than $100 million in production losses.    Peru is a leading world producer of silver and copper and a major source of gold, lead and zinc. The country traditionally receives more than 50% of its revenues from mineral exports, which last year totaled $1.2 billion.    Prime Minister Armando Villanueva and federation chief Saul Cantoral, with more than a dozen other top government and union officials, signed the agreement late Tuesday night, the official Gazette el Peruano said.    The pact calls for the nation's miners to return to work and gives tentative approval to a major strike demand that all labor contracts be negotiated jointly, El Peruano said.    The federation, which claims to represent 75% of the country's estimated 90,000 mine workers, said the strike had paralyzed 90% of the mineral activity.    Industry analysts said the strike has reduced output of silver by 75% and copper by 70%.    State-run Centromin, the nation's largest mining company, declared a force majeure on July 29, halting exports of copper, lead and zinc.    The government and the National Society of Mining and Petroleum, a private mine owners trade group, earlier rejected strikers' main demand for joint negotiations, arguing that each company faced unique problems.    Analysts said miners unions are seeking to enhance their bargaining position by unifying contract negotiations.    An official decree recognizing the demand for joint negotiations was to be issued today, officials said.    Peru's mineral industry has been battered with labor strikes this year, because of a declining national economy. Centromin alone has undergone 36 strikes prior to the nationwide strike, company officials said. </TEXT></DOC>
