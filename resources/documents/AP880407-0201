A spokeswoman for the Contra umbrella organization, theNicaraguan Resistance, said Thursday the rebels were refusing todiscuss giving up their arms.   The talks were at the southern border town of Sapoa, where thetwo sides reached a cease-fire accord on March 23. That agreementrequires them to reach a permanent truce to end the nearly7-year-old war that the leftist government says has claimed morethan 26,000 lives.   The two delegations decided Wednesday on the number and locationof the zones where the rebels will gather during the 60-daycease-fire. It went into effect last Friday, although all thedetails were not worked out.   President Daniel Ortega warned Wednesday that the Sandinistaswould launch an offensive against the Contras if they fail tocomply with the March 23 accord.   Under that agreement, the rebels said they would gather in thecease-fire zones while their leaders negotiated a more permanenttruce. In exchange, the Sandinistas have pledged to carry outdemocratic reforms.   But the Sapoa talks have been marked by mutual distrust anddiffering interpretations of the vaguely worded plan.   Still unresolved were pledges of security for the Contras insidethe cease-fire zones, how they would receive food and othersupplies, who would control the areas and how compliance would beverified.   Marta Sacasa, a spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Resistance, saidthe rebels at the Sapoa talks were refusing to discuss the delicateissue of the Contras laying down their weapons.   The March 23 accord does not mention disarming, something theContras vow they will never do, Ms. Sacasa said in a telephoneinterview Thursday from Miami.   The Sandinistas claim that surrendering of weapons is implicitin the agreement and essential for peace.   Meanwhile, pro-government newspapers Thursday described as``false'' a document circulating in the capital said to be from theruling Sandinista National Liberation Front.   The document, marked ``secret,'' appears to have been writtenearlier this year and outlines party strategy.   According to the document, Sandinista troops should stage anoffensive along the Honduran border to rid the area of Contras andtheir supply bases.   Such an offensive, it argues, would oblige Honduras to acceptthe presence of United Nations peacekeeping troops in the borderarea.   ``The incursions by our troops into Honduras in pursuit of themercenaries will surely provoke imperialist reactions, which wehave to watch but not fear,'' the document said.   The Sandinistas did carry out an offensive against the Contrasin the northern border area in March.   President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras charged that Sandinistaforces had entered his country's territory while chasing therebels. President Reagan responded by sending 3,200 U.S. troops toHonduras for two weeks of exercises. Ortega denied his troops hadentered the neighboring country.   The document also noted House Speaker Jim Wright's opposition tothe Reagan administration's policies towards Nicaragua.   It called Wright, D-Texas, the head of a ``parallel power thathas enabled us to tie the hands of the (Reagan) administration.''   Ortega said Thursday his government sent a letter of protest tothe Organization of American States denouncing a reported offer byHonduras to allow Contra supplies from the United States to arrivethere.   Speaking in a radio interview, Ortega said Honduras made itselfan ``instrument of American policies'' by acting as an ``illegalspringboard for supplies for the mercenary forces.''</TEXT></DOC>
