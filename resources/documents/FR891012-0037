EPA previously established reportingthresholds for the first two years of reporting (52 FR 38344; October 15,1987). EPA also promulgated zero thresholds in that rulemaking to becomeeffective in the third year of reporting, but stated in the preamble thatit would conduct further studies of all threshold alternatives and wouldpropose final reporting thresholds before the beginning of the third yearof reporting.After completing its study of alternative thresholds, EPA published a Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing final reporting thresholds (54FR 12992; March 29, 1989). Also as part of the NPRM, EPA proposed to eliminatethe language in 40 CFR 370.20 that established the three-year phased-inreporting requirements established by the October 17, 1987 final rule,intending to subject all sectors of industry to the same final reportingthresholds on the same effective dates. In today's Supplemental Notice,EPA is clarifying and soliciting comments on its intent to establish, inthe final rule on reporting thresholds, uniform effective dates for finalreporting thresholds for all facilities required to submit reports undersections 311 and 312, regardless of the threshold option selected in thefinal rule. In this Supplemental Notice, EPA is using the term ``final''rather than ``permanent'' threshold to avoid the misapprehension that nochanges in the thresholds could ever be made in the future.Also, EPA is today announcing the availability of the results of an analysisof reporting thresholds under State Right-to-Know laws.Elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA is promulgating an Interim Final Rule extending,for manufacturing facilities, the reporting thresholds established forthe first two years of reporting under the October 15, 1987 rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received on or before November 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments may be mailed or delivered to the SuperfundDocket clerk.

Introduction</ITAG>A. Statutory AuthorityThis Supplemental Notice is issued under sections 311 and 312 of TitleIII of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA)(Pub. L. 99-499; 42 U.S.C. 11001 <T3>et seq</T3>.). Title III is the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-KnowAct of 1986.B. BackgroundSection 311 of Title III applies to the owner or operator of a facilitywhere there are hazardous chemicals present for which the owner or operatormust prepare or have available a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) underthe Hazard Communication Standards (HCS) (29 CFR 1910) promulgated underthe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Under section 311 of TitleIII, the owner or operator of a facility must submit individual MSDSs,or a list of chemicals for which the facility is required to have MSDSs,to the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency PlanningCommittee (LEPC), and the local fire department. The HCS does not listspecific chemicals; a ``hazardous chemical,'' as defined in the HCS, isone that poses either a physical or health hazard. The tens of thousandsof chemicals covered by the HCS include petroleum products, explosives,and carcinogens.The HCS regulations were initially restricted to facilities in StandardIndustrial Classification (SIC) codes 20 through 39, that is, the manufacturingsector. On August 24, 1987, however, the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA) revised the HCS to cover facilities in the non-manufacturingsector as well as facilities in the manufacturing sector (52 FR 51852).A challenge to the revised standards by several industrial groups resultedin a temporary stay for non-manufacturing facilities. On July 22, 1988,OSHA clarified that the HCS was in effect for non-manufacturing facilitiesas of June 24, 1988, except for the construction industry (53 FR 27679).On February 15, 1989, OSHA notified EPA that all provisions of the HCSwere in effect as of January 30, 1989 for all segments of industry, includingthe construction industry (54 FR 6886).For facilities in SIC codes 20 through 39, the initial MSDSs or lists wererequired to be submitted to the appropriate SERC, LEPC, and fire departmentby October 17, 1987. Non-manufacturers were required to submit their MSDSsor lists by September 24, 1988 (i.e., three months after they became subjectto the HCS, as specified in 40 CFR 370.20(b)). Facilities in the constructionindustry were required to submit their MSDSs or lists by April 30, 1989.Thereafter, if a facility begins to use a chemical subject to the HCS ina quantity at or above the reporting threshold, or if a facility learnsthat its previously submitted MSDS is inaccurate for any reason, the facilitymust submit the new or correct information within three months to the appropriateSERC, LEPC, and the local fire department (40 CFR 370.21(c)).Under section 312 of Title III, owners and operators covered by section311 of Title III are required to submit additional information on the presenceand location of hazardous chemicals at their facilities. Beginning March1, 1988 for manufacturers, March 1, 1989 for non-manufacturers, March 1,1990 for the construction industry, and annually thereafter, all facilitiesaffected by the HCS that have hazardous chemicals at or above the reportingthresholds must submit a ``Tier I'' inventory form and may be requiredto submit a ``Tier II'' inventory form to SERCs, or LEPCs, and fire departments.Tier I forms require general information on the amount and location ofhazardous chemicals by category; Tier I forms must be submitted annually.Tier II forms require more detailed information on individual chemicalsand must be submitted on request. Facilities may submit Tier II forms inlieu of Tier I forms.Title III (section 311(b)) states that the EPA Administrator may establishreporting thresholds (i.e., quantities of hazardous chemicals) such thatif the hazardous chemical subject to the HCS is present at a facility ina quantity that is below the reporting threshold, the facility is not requiredto report the presence of that chemical under the provisions of sections311 and 312 of Title III. On October 15, 1987, EPA promulgated regulations(52 FR 38334) establishing reporting thresholds under section 311(b) ofTitle III for facilities subject to the OSHA HCS regulations. The reportingthreshold established for the first two years was 10,000 pounds, exceptfor EHSs, which must be reported at the lower of 500 pounds or the TPQ.Access to information below these thresholds was preserved in that facilitiesmust provide any such information when requested in accordance with 40CFR 370.20(b)(3).A threshold of zero pounds is currently in effect for the third year ofreporting; that is, there is no threshold as of the third year. In thepreamble to the October 15, 1987 final rule, however, EPA stated its intentionto reevaluate the reporting thresholds and, if appropriate, to promulgatefinal reporting thresholds different from zero prior to the beginning ofthe third year of reporting.On March 29, 1989 (54 FR 12991), EPA published an NPRM in which it proposedto maintain the current reporting thresholds through and beyond the thirdyear of reporting (i.e., final reporting thresholds would be establishedat 10,000 pounds for all non-EHS hazardous chemicals and 500 pounds orthe TPQ, whichever is lower, for EHSs). In the proposed regulatory languagein 40 CFR 370.20, EPA eliminated the terminology providing for three-yearphased-in reporting that was established by the October 15, 1987 finalrule. Today's Supplemental Notice clarifies that in the final rule, EPAintends to eliminate phased-in reporting, and to establish uniform effectivedates for all facilities reporting under sections 311 and 312 and EPA'simplementing regulations, regardless of the threshold option that is selectedfor promulgation. Under the proposed provisions, therefore, for all facilitiessubject to reporting under sections 311 and 312, including facilities inthe construction industry and facilities newly subject to the reportingrequirements, October 17, 1990 will be the effective date for final reportingthresholds for reports submitted under section 311; March 1, 1991 willbe the effective date for final reporting thresholds for reports submittedunder section 312.EPA believes that today's clarification is necessary to allow the publicto understand fully the implications of all of the proposed threshold options.Regardless of the threshold option promulgated in the final rule, the effectivedate will be the same. This issue was not addressed in the NPRM becausethe proposed final reporting thresholds simply extended current reportinglevels and, therefore, the issue of a phase-in was moot. EPA wants to ensurewith today's clarification, however, that all commenters understand EPA'sintent to eliminate the phase-in.EPA established the three-year phase-in reporting requirements in the October15, 1987 final rule to address several concerns. First, because the TitleIII reporting requirements were new and unfamiliar to many facilities,especially smaller facilities more likely to have smaller inventories ofchemicals, and because many State and local governments needed time toobtain funding and to establish the organizations and information managementsystems necessary to process reported information, EPA believed that phase-inreporting thresholds for facilities in all industrial sectors, includingthe manufacturing sector, were necessary to minimize the possibility ofoverwhelming the SERCs, LEPCs, and local fire departments during the initialimplementation of the reporting requirements and to allow time for facilitieswith smaller chemical inventories to learn about and become familiar withthe reporting requirements.Second, EPA was aware that the OSHA HCS requirements were likely to beextended beyond the manufacturing sector. The OSHA extension to the non-manufacturingsector would result in a very large increase in the number of facilitiesthat would be subject to the requirements of sections 311 and 312 of TitleIII. To facilitate compliance by these non-manufacturing facilities ata time when they were first becoming familiar with the HCS regulations,EPA believed it was most prudent to phase-in the lower reporting thresholds.These purposes for phase-in reporting are no longer valid. State and localgovernments have improved their data management capabilities and all industrysectors have been required to submit at least initial reports under section311 and have some knowledge and understanding of the reporting requirements.In addition, EPA has participated in extensive outreach activities, helpingboth large and small facilities to understand the Title III reporting requirements.EPA believes, therefore, that eliminating phased-in reporting and establishinguniform effective dates for compliance with final reporting thresholdswill not impose a significant burden on the regulated community or on theSERCs, LEPCs, and fire departments.For non-manufacturing facilities, other than the construction industry,the deadline for compliance with the final reporting thresholds under section311 would actually be extended several weeks from September 23, 1990 toOctober 17, 1990. For section 312 reporting, the effective date for compliancewith the final threshold would remain March 1, 1991.EPA acknowledges that these changes would shorten the phase-in period forfacilities in the construction industry. Instead of having to comply withthe third-year reporting thresholds for section 311 on April 30, 1991 andfor section 312 on March 1, 1992, facilities in the construction industrywould have to comply with the third-year reporting thresholds on October17, 1990 for section 311 and March 1, 1991 or section 312. EPA expectsto promulgate the final rule well before the third-year reporting deadlinesbecome effective, however, providing the construction industry ample timeto prepare and submit reports in compliance with the final thresholds.Also, although EPA is aware that under the proposed uniform dates, newfacilities must comply with the final thresholds without a phase-in period,EPA believes that the number of these facilities will not be large andthat the impact of compliance will be mitigated by the simplification ofthe reporting requirements.In fact, uniform effective dates will simplify reporting requirements andlessen the likelihood of reporting errors across all industry sectors byrequiring that all facilities report under the same thresholds on or beforethe same dates. As a result, State and local authorities will receive informationin compliance with consistent reporting thresholds at consistent timesduring the year. EPA believes that the importance of receiving informationon chemical inventories and the inherent simplicity associated with theuniform reporting dates more than justify the additional burden on theconstruction industry and newly-affected facilities. EPA believes, therefore,that the overall effect of the changes clarified in today's SupplementalNotice will be to reduce the effort required to prepare, submit, and evaluatereports under section 311 and 312. EPA solicits comments on the clarificationin today's Supplemental Notice.C. Proposed Uniform Effective Dates for Compliance with Reporting Thresholdsunder SARA sections 311 and 312Establishing uniform effective dates for all sectors of industry subjectto reporting requirements under sections 311 and 312 would result in thefollowing changes in the reporting requirements under 40 CFR 370.20: (1)For non-manufacturing facilities other than in the construction industry,the effective date for final reporting thresholds under section 311 wouldbe extended from September 24, 1990 to October 17, 1990; for section 312reporting, the effective date for final thresholds would remain March 1,1991; (2) For facilities in the construction industry, the effective datefor final reporting thresholds under section 311 would be changed fromApril 30, 1991 to October 17, 1990; for section 312 reporting, the effectivedate would be changed from March 1, 1992 to March 1, 1991; and (3) Forfacilities newly subject to the reporting requirements of sections 311and 312, final reporting thresholds for sections 311 and 312 would becomeeffective on October 17, 1990 and March 1, 1991, respectively. The manufacturingsector would not be affected by this clarification.<ITAG tagnum="84">II.
