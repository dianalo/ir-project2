There are already 17,000 Soviets waiting in Italy for permissionto enter the United States, and those who are rejected can ``alwaysgo to Israel or return to Russia,'' Jewel S. Lafontant, the StateDepartment's coordinator for refugee affairs, told the Housesubcommittee on immigration.   ``In these days of glasnost, that's not an impossible thing,''she said.   Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., was critical of Lafontant's solution.   ``I don't think this is an appropriate response to someone who'sbeen languishing outside his country with the expectation of beingallowed to come here,'' he told reporters. ``You can't turn aroundand send them back.''   The majority of Soviet refugees are Jews who leave the SovietUnion on Israeli visas, shifting direction for the United Statesonce they reach processing centers in Vienna or Rome.   Israel, facing an increased Arab population both within andoutside its borders, has said it would welcome more Soviet Jews.   However, the Arab League reacted angrily Wednesday, sayingincreased Jewish immigration could ``adversely affect Palestinianrights and the future of peace and stability in the Middle East.''   The administration, testifying on its worldwide refugee plan forfiscal 1990, said it doesn't have sufficient money to fund the125,000 refugees it wants to admit beginning Oct. 1. That figurerepresents about an 8 percent increase from fiscal 1989.   Soviet refugees are the largest group among the 125,000, followedby Vietnam with 26,500, East Asians with 25,000 and 6,500 each fromEastern Europe, the Near East and South Asia.   The figure for Eastern Europe, the same as this year's, isdesigned mostly for Poles and Hungarians who already have applied,as well as for a possible increase in Romanian and Bulgarianapplicants, administration officials said.   The most controversial element in the administration proposalcenters on Soviet refugees, whose numbers have swelled as a resultof President Mikhail Gorbachev's liberalized emigration policies.   ``The increased refugee flow brings problems in its wake,''Lafontant said. ``But how much better it is to have to deal with theproblems caused by the success of one's policies than to deal withproblems caused by failure.''   In an emergency move last spring, the administration nearlydoubled its Soviet refugee quota for fiscal 1989 to 44,000.   Jewish groups estimate at least 72,000 Jews, and more than100,000 Soviets altogether, will apply for refugee status in fiscal1990.   ``With no sign of decline in applications from Soviet citizensseeking admission to the U.S., we judge that 50,000 is, if anything,a conservative estimate of the potential admission requirements,''said Princeton Lyman, the State Department's director of the Officeof Refugee Programs.   Lyman said the administration's proposed fiscal 1990 budgetincludes funding for only 84,000 refugees, placing the onus on thecongressional appropriations committees to come up with about $60million to pay for the remainder.   About 10,000 of the 125,000 slots will be funded by privateorganizations, he said.   Lyman also said the administration, in an effort to save moneyand accommodate increasing numbers of Soviet refugees, was changingits method of processing applicants by beefing up the staff at theMoscow embassy and enlarging its facilities in the United States toenable some processing here.   Sources have said the proposal foresees phasing out facilities inLadispoli outside Rome, and in Vienna. Both serve as waiting pointsfor Soviet emigres seeking refugee status.   The administration estimates that as many as 20,000 Soviets arewaiting in Italy and Austria, while another 35,000 applicants arewaiting processing in Moscow.   Lyman said top priority would be granted to those who havealready applied for refugee status. If a large number of those areapproved, most of the proposed 50,000 slots would be taken, leavinglittle room for new applicants.   Those who are ineligible as refugees, who are given fullgovernment funding, may still apply as immigrants or seek specialparole status.   Officials also told the panel they didn't anticipate growth inthe number of refugees from Nicaragua despite a project todemobilize the U.S.-supported Contra rebels and send them home fromtheir bases in Honduras and Costa Rica.   Of the 3,500 slots allotted to Latin America and the Caribbean,about 3,000 are expected to be filled by Cubans.</TEXT></DOC>
