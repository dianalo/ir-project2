The staff has undertaken to develop moredetailed guidance to implement the severe accident policy for those futureLight Water Reactors (LWRs) of evolutionary design (Advanced Boiling WaterReactor, CE-System 80+, SP/90) and the Electric Power Research Institute'sAdvanced LWR Requirements' Document and intends to hold periodic publicmeetings to inform the public of this work and to solicit comments. OnJune 9, 1988, the first of these meetings was held.
