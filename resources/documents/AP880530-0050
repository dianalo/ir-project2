Also Sunday, a guerrilla leader claimed anti-government forcescontrol 90 percent of the Afghan countryside.   During talks in Peshawar, Pakistan, rebel alliance spokesmanGulbadin Hekmatyar urged the U.N. official overseeing Afghanrefugees to work with reconstruction and resettlement commissionsalready set up by the guerrillas.   In Kabul, meanwhile, Najib said he would not concede anyterritory to the guerrillas, who have been fighting hisSoviet-backed government for a decade.   In a 20-minute speech interrupted seven times by applause frommembers of Parliament, Najib continued his efforts to portrayhimself as no longer the leader of a one-party state.   The Parliament, the first in 15 years, was elected April 14 aspart of a government effort to widen its base. It consists of theHouse of Representatives and a 158-member Senate and replaces theRevolutionary Council as Afghanistan's law-making body.   The guerrilla groups called the elections a farce.   Foreign observers say virtually all the seats in the House notoccupied by members of Najib's People's Democratic Party ofAfghanistan are held by groups or individuals with ties to thegovernment.   Two former guerrillas hold what the government calls``opposition'' seats.   There are 50 vacant seats that Najib says have been left openfor the guerrillas if they stop fighting.   ``We are ready to listen to the views of the opposition,'' Najibsaid. ``We are ready to receive them in Kabul.''   The session was held as rebel forces have been mounting attacksin and around Kabul.   Najib said the signing of an accord last month providing for thewithdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan ``opened new doors forpeace in Afghanistan,'' but he said it ``does not mean overnightpeace.''   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have not halted their battle despitethe start of the Soviet withdrawal May 15, and they say they'llkeep fighting as long as Najib, a former secret police commander,remains in power.   Rocket attacks by the guerrillas have grown more frequent sinceSoviet troops started withdrawing. The Kabul Times reported thatfive people were killed in rocket attacks Friday.   In the frontier city of Peshawar, U.N. refugee commissionerSadaruddin Agha Khan held talks with rebel leaders and refugees.   He is charged with overseeing repatriation of refugees, whonumber about 3 million in Pakistan and 2 million in Iran.   Hekmatyar said guerrilla forces now hold 90 percent of theAfghan countryside and told Agha Khan that he expects few Afghanrefugees to return this year.   However, he said most will resettle within a few months afterall Soviet troops pull out. Final withdrawal is scheduled for Feb.15, 1989.   During his meeting with the seven-party rebel Afghan Alliance,Agha Khan said, ``I made it clear to the people in Kabul we have tohave access to all regions everywhere in all provinces ofAfghanistan.''   The Afghan government was told that ``help would never bechanneled through one particular source and be used as a weapon, ''he said.   Hekmatyar said millions of mines littering Afghanistan have tobe defused before refugees can return.   ``It is the duty of the U.N. and its coordinator to ask andpersuade the Russians to de-mine all of Afghanistan and take backall that they have planted,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
