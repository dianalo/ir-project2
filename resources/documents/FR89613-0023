(Board Res. No. 89-1526,June 1, 1989). The final rule modifies the current schedule for calculatingthe permissible deductible to provide for a  minimum permissible deductibleof $50,000.  The Board is considering, and by this Advance Notice is soliciting  publiccomment on, substantive revisions to its fidelity bond  regulations. TheBoard specifically requests comments on revisions to the minimum bond coveragerequirements, the required bond coverage of  Form No. 22, and informationfrom insured institutions on the amount of  bond purchased and the premiumpaid for that coverage.  The Board is considering possible revisions to Form No. 22. The  AmericanSurety Association Form No. 22 Blanket Bond was approved by the  Boardin 1982. At the same time, the Board issued a regulation  requiring allFSLIC-insured institutions to have bond coverage  equivalent to Form No.22. On October 7, 1988, the Office of General  Counsel disseminated anopinion regarding fidelity bond coverage. The  opinion stated that bondsdeviating materially from Form No. 22 do not  comply with 12 CFR 563.19and do not satisfy the regulatory requirement.  Through this Advance Notice,the Board requests comments on possible  revisions to Form No. 22. Additionally,the Board is considering  revisions to the amount of bond required. Currentregulations provide  for coverage of $3,000,000. The Board is consideringincreasing the  maximum required bond amount to reflect the increased assetsizes of  insured institutions. Furthermore, the Board is requesting information from insured institutions on their bond coverage, specifically the  amountof bond purchased and the premium paid for that coverage.  The Board invites comment on all aspects of this Notice and of  andSection;563.19. After reviewing the comments received, the Board anticipates  promulgatinga notice of proposed rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John F.
