Evaluation methods of energy hazard withoutcomputation and testing are then given followed by two practical methodsfor predicting energy hazard by computation. All the data necessary forcalculation are given. In three chapters, the testing methods are introducedin detail and examples of results of each test and comprehensive evaluationsare given. The final three chapters deal in turn with activities of safetyorganizations in different countries, emergency response systems, andcountermeasures to be adopted for the storage and handling of reactivechemicals in areas where earthquakes may occur.</TEXT></DOC>
