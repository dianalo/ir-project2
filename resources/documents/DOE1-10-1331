<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-10-1331 </DOCNO><TEXT>An electrolyser working under a pressure of 4 bar at 110{sup 0}C and 4kA/m{sup 2} was built. The stack is made of 19 cells of 0.2 m{sup 2}active surface, obtained by a circular geometry of 0.5 m in diameter,electrolyte channels being external. Frames are made out of polysulfone.A specially developed thin asbestos diaphragm, having an electric resistanceof 0.2 {Omega}cm{sup 2}, is used. Catalysis is obtained with Raney nickelat the cathode and perovskite Sr/sub 0.5/ La/sub 0.5/ CoO{sub 3} depositedon Raney nickel at the anode. Electrodes are bipolar with elastic forelectrodesdesigned to obtain a zero gap between them and the diaphragm. The electrolytecirculates by gas lift, all functions of start up, monitoring and emergencyshut down are performed by an on line computer. The automatic operationof the electrolyser proved to be completely satisfactory. The performancesof catalyzed cells was 1.95 volt, which is 100 mV over the voltage observedin the laboratory.</TEXT></DOC>
