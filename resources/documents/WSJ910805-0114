Makoto Tanabe, who last week succeeded Takako Doi aschairman of Japan's Social Democratic Party, also called forlegislation to prohibit retiring Japanese bureaucrats fromtaking posts in companies supervised by their ministries, apractice known in Japan as ama kudari, or &quot;descent fromheaven.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The shady financial dealings uncovered in the securitiesscandal are part of &quot;the last preserve&quot; of cozy Japanesepolitical practices, said Mr. Tanabe, the son of a Christiansocial worker. &quot;The securities business is an issue wehaven't been able to take up&quot; in the Diet, or parliament, hesaid. The session starting today &quot;provides an opportunity wemust seize.&quot;   Separately, in a hearing Friday before the Upper House'sFinance Committee, a Ministry of Finance official said theministry is considering revising Japan's securities law sothat investors who receive compensation payments for losseswould be punished. The ministry has said it would amend thelaw to ban such compensation payments by securities firms.But Finance Ministry officials have indicated they don'tfavor setting up an independent securities watchdog agency.   Under government pressure, securities firms last weekpublished the names of hundreds of clients, almost all ofthem companies, that received compensation for tradinglosses. The payments have outraged small investors who hadlosses when Tokyo's stock market plunged last year.   Mr. Tanabe said the Diet must first determine whether thelists published so far are complete, or whether activity onbehalf of politicians has been hidden, as some rumors inTokyo's political-financial nexus have it. Afterinvestigating the facts, the legislature should consider waysto make the country's markets &quot;fair and open.&quot;   Mr. Tanabe said his party would demand a full accountingfrom Shin Kanemaru, a powerful factional leader in Japan'sruling Liberal Democratic Party, concerning compensationpayments made to a firm controlled by Mr. Kanemaru's wife.Okasan Securities Co. last Thursday confirmed it had paid 21million yen ($153,000) in compensation to the firm,represented at the time by Mr. Kanemaru's son. The firm wasset up to handle the proceeds of a real estate sale by Mr.Kanemaru's wife, according to Japanese press reports.   Mr. Kanemaru and Mr. Tanabe have had close personal tiesfor years. But the LDP elder &quot;should make the truth known,&quot;including whether he had a hand in the compensation payments,Mr. Tanabe said.   At their convention last week, the Social Democrats --known until this year as the Japan Socialist Party -- adopteda package of policy reforms drafted under Mr. Tanabe'ssupervision after the party's heavy losses in local electionsin April. The document moderates the party's traditionalopposition to the country's Self-Defense Forces and to theU.S.-Japan security treaty. Although subtle wording changeswere made at the convention, Mr. Tanabe took issue with newsreports suggesting that the alterations represented asubstantial compromise with the party's left wing.   A tall, slender man who remains one of the country's smallminority of Christians, Mr. Tanabe insists that his party'sbasic message of social equity hasn't lost its relevance toaverage Japanese. Some political observers believe the partyis likely to split eventually, as pragmatists such as Mr.Tanabe part ways with adherents to the party's oldMarxist-based philosophy. But Mr. Tanabe insisted the partyis better for embracing a range of views.   The wealth created by property-price inflation in the1980s has left many Japanese feeling that their lives haven'timproved, despite the country's increased wealth, Mr. Tanabesaid. He noted that leaders of other parties last weekaccepted a Social Democratic Party proposal for a committeeto study the logistics of moving the capital outside ofTokyo, a plan Mr. Tanabe described as a necessary first stepto reducing urban crowding and thus land prices. The idea wasendorsed in principle by the Diet last year, but manyobservers view it as a symbolic resolution that is unlikelyto be implemented.   Mr. Tanabe next year reaches the party's retirement age of70 for Diet members. Although the rules may be bent to allowhim to stay on, Mr. Tanabe said he doesn't expect his tenureto last many years. So he hopes to fashion a coalition withthe centrist Komeito and Democratic Socialist parties strongenough to challenge the conservative LDP, which has heldpower since its formation in 1955. He ruled out including theJapan Communist Party in any coalition.   &quot;No other developed country has had one-party rule for solong,&quot; Mr. Tanabe said. &quot;That gives rise to corruption&quot; ofthe sort that surfaced during the 1980s Recruitinfluence-peddling scandal.   In Friday's Diet hearing, Nobuhiko Matsuno, head of thefinance ministry's securities bureau, also said that of the22 securities firms under the ministry's control, a total of17 have already admitted compensating clients. He said hebelieves the remaining five have not made such payments,although other minor brokerage firms not under the ministry'scontrol may have also compensated clients.   In addition, Mr. Matsuno suggested that Nomura SecuritiesCo. may have violated a ministry directive in its dealingsconcerning Tokyu Corp. shares. The 1974 directive forbaderecommendation of specific shares to investors. The Nomuracase being studied by the ministry involves the purchase of26 million Tokyu shares by the former leader of Japan'sInagawakai gangster group from April 1989 to the fall of thatyear. In an October 1989 published portfolio recommendation,Nomura recommended Tokyu shares among others. Tokyu's shareprice surged over the following months.   ---   Masayoshi Kanabayashi contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
