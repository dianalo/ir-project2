Prominent Democrats and Dukakis' doctor, meantime, suggestedthat political motivations were behind a rumor that Dukakis hadbeen treated for mental problems _ a rumor both Dukakis and thedoctor denied.   And the Bush campaign received its strongest ``No, thank you''yet from a man frequently mentioned as a prospective running mate,California Gov. George Deukmejian.   Bush, in Corpus Christi, Texas, told a group of Hispanicveterans that Dukakis' positions were ``a rejection of America'srole as a world leader and a repudiation of the Truman doctrine andthe vision of John Kennedy.''   Dukakis' opposition to new nuclear weapons such as the MXmissile were part of a policy for ``unilateral disarmament,'' Bushtold the G.I. Forum.   President Reagan lent Bush a helping hand earlier this week byvetoing a defense bill passed by the Democratic-controlledCongress. Although the bill provided an agreed-upon $299.5 billionfor the Pentagon, Reagan said it was too restrictive, especially onhis ``Star Wars'' missile defense program.   ``The only reason anyone can possbily give for it is that itmight help the vice president,'' Dukakis said Thursday evening inLos Angeles. ``I don't think it helps the vice president. Itcertainly doesn't help the nation. It doesn't help our nationalsecurity.''   Republicans in the Senate on Thursday were pushing for moremoney for arms to the Contras, at least in part to embarrassDukakis. The Massachusetts governor's running mate, Sen. LloydBentsen, D-Texas, disagrees with Dukakis on that issue and usuallysupports Contra aid.   Dukakis, in Philadelphia, Miss., repeated his theme of makingthe military spend its money more wisely. And he told reporters itwas ``nonsense'' for Bush to suggest he favored disarmament.   ``The fact of the matter is we have a massive survivable nucleardeterrent right now, 12,000 strategic nuclear warheads,'' he said.``What we don't have is the kind of strong conventional defensecapability we must have, and that is going to be my top priority aspresident.''   Asked whether he still supports a nuclear freeze, Dukakis said,``Sure, and a comprehensive test ban treaty.''   Later aboard his plane, Dukakis said he originally supported afreeze ``because we wanted to stop the administration fromexpanding the arsenal.''   ``Now, it's turned around and we're talking about reduction. I'mfor reductions now,'' he said. ``I favor the development of certainarms systems. I favor deep cuts in strategic weapons systems.''   Dukakis spoke to a mostly white audience estimated at more than6,000 at the Neshoba County Fair, where eight years ago Reaganlaunched his campaign as the new Republican presidential nominee.   At the same time, he was campaigning in a state where he lostthis year's Democratic primary to Jackson.   He talked of civil rights in addition to his usual calls forindustrial revitalization and investment in schools.   ``Let us work together to see that every citizen and every childborn in this country is an equal shareholder in the Americandream,'' he said.   Elsewhere, Democrats expressed anger about a rumor that Dukakishad problems with mental depression in the 1970s, first followingthe death of his brother and then with his 1978 primary defeat forre-election as governor.   ``I think there's something significant about what theRepublicans have done here, the fact that they would use LyndonLaRouche to get this thing started, the fact that they would getnegative, that they would get to irrelevant so early,'' said NewYork Gov. Mario Cuomo.   At the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta two weeks ago,supporters of LaRouche, a political extremist and fringepresidential candidate, distributed fliers suggesting Dukakis wasunstable.   Dukakis' doctor for the past 17 years, Gerald R. Plotkin, said,``I would have to assume that the rumors are political. I don'tknow whether the term is dirty tricks, but I think certainly theallegations ... have no basis in fact.''   The issue became widely publicized Wednesday after Reagan calledDukakis ``an invalid'' during a news briefing. Reagan later said hewas trying to make a joke but ``it didn't work.''   Bush told reporters Thursday that he ``would thoroughlydisapprove of it'' if anyone from his campaign was involved in therumor-making.   His chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said that on Wednesdaycampaign manager Lee Atwater ``admonished everybody to stay out ofthis story, stay out of the rumor business.''   Fuller also confirmed that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker IIIwould leave his post and become campaign chief before the Aug. 15start of the Republican convention in New Orleans.   Between swipes at Dukakis, Bush is looking for a running matebut it looked as if it won't be Deukmejian, who as governor ofCalifornia might help Bush in the state with the most electoralvotes.   ``I am honored and very grateful for your consideration, but Imust tell you that I cannot be considered for the office of vicepresident,'' Deukmejian said in a letter to Bush, released byDeukmejian's press secretary in Sacramento, Calif.   ``As you know, if I were to assume the vice presidency, it wouldmean turning the entire executive branch of the nation's mostpopulous state over to the Democratic Party,'' said Deukmejian, whowas on a trip to Seoul, Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
