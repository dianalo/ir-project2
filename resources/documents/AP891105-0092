(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The gritty freight trains that pass bythe office building help keep work in perspective for R. ReddingStevenson Jr.   The groaning engines and clatter of boxcars offer are a sharpcontrast to the sleek design and sophisticated features proposedfor what could be the nation's fastest train network. But they alsoremind Stevenson of how little trains are used to carry passengers,particularly in the car-clogged Sunbelt.   ``There's a lot of people who've never even been on a train, letalone use one to commute or go on trips,'' said Stevenson,president of Florida High Speed Rail Corp., the only company leftseeking the $2.2 billion project to connect Miami, Orlando andTampa with a train capable of traveling at 150 mph.   ``As our roads get more congested, as airport delays become moreroutine, rail looks more and more like the option for the future.''   The Boca Raton-based consortium of more than 30 firms _ fromrail designers to real estate planners _ appears virtually certainof receiving the state contract for the high-speed project afterlast week's withdrawal of its sole competitor, TGV of Florida Inc.,a subsidiary of the French ``bullet train'' operators.   The Florida High Speed Rail Commission has asked the company todevelop more detailed plans for the construction and operation ofthe 300-mile system. The final contract should be awarded next year.   ``We are truly seeing history in the making,'' said CommissionChairman Malcolm Kirschenbaum in Orlando last week.   Stevenson, a former real estate developer, was joined theproject in the initial stages as a consultant and ended upconductor.   In the early 1980s, Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. was among aninternational group of companies with interest in the Floridaproject. As an incentive to bidders, the state offered exclusivereal estate development rights along much of the rail line, andBombardier sought out AmeriFirst Development Corp., one ofFlorida's largest home builders.   When Bombardier dropped out, Stevenson, then an AmeriFirstexecutive, approached Asea Brown Boveri, a multinational firmheavily involved in high-speed rail technology. The corporation wasformed in 1986.   The company's plans call for steel-wheel trains, rather than themore experimental magnetic-levitation systems used in Japan thatcan exceed 200 mph. But Stevenson said magnetic trains could beused as feeders to some of the 13 proposed stations.   To promote business travel, Stevenson envisions office-type carsused on some European trains with computers, telephones, copiersand facsimile machines.   Stevenson also says the rail system will court the state'sestimated 50 million annual tourists, many heading for cruise portsor Disney World, where a magnetic-levitation train connection toOrlando International Airport is planned for the early 1990s.   ``We have to make the trip enjoyable for everyone _ fromtourists to business travelers _ or else we won't have anyriders,'' he said. ``But that shouldn't be hard. It's no fundriving in most places now. It's not that fun to fly, and I don'tthink there are many people who like taking the bus. What's left?''   The trains could be rolling as early as 1994 with fares fromMiami to Tampa between $30 to $69, Stevenson said.   Meanwhile, he believes rail travel will become more attractiveas traffic snarls and gridlock worsen around Florida, one of thenation's fastest growing states.   ``There is no way we can build enough roads to keep pace withtraffic demands,'' said Stevenson. ``But what we do have is aninfrastructure of 200,000 miles of track around the country readyto be used.''   Worldwide, there are between 2,500 and 3,000 miles of high-speedrail, including the 125 mph Amtrak link from Washington to NewYork, said Raul Bravo, a rail consultant working on a proposedEuropean rail network that could add more than 15,000 miles to thehigh-speed system by the year 2000.   Amtrak last year reported a record 21.5 million passengers andsimilar projections are being made for 1989, said spokesmanClifford Black.   ``We've ignored the train for about 40 years,'' said Stevenson.``That's too long.''</TEXT></DOC>
