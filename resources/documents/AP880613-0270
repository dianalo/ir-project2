The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Sundayadjourned its regular midyear conference to allow the 13-nationcartel's oil ministers to informally discuss disagreements.   The conference began Saturday and will resume Tuesday.   The ministers have been considering whether to change anexisting agreement among 12 of the members that limits their oilproduction to 15.06 million barrels a day.   That quota, which was extended in December and expires June 30,was aimed at supporting oil prices at $18 a barrel.   Iraq has refused to sign the agreement because it wants anoutput quota equal to that of Iran. Iraq, at war with Iran sinceSeptember 1980, was granted a quota of 1.54 million barrels a dayin a previous agreement. Iran's daily quota is 2.369 millionbarrels.   Some OPEC members want to cut production to push oil prices up,while others want to increase output or at least hold it steady totake advantage of an expected increase in demand later this year.   But analysts believe OPEC is so deeply divided it will extendthe existing agreement for at least three months.   ``We are working on compromise,'' Indonesian oil ministerGinandjar Kartasasmita said today. ``There are agreements on mostof the issues.''   He said he strongly believed the cartel would make a decisioneither Tuesday or Wednesday.   ``There will definitely be an agreement,'' added Saudi Arabianoil minister Hisham Nazer.   But ministerial sources from two countries also said Sunday thatthe cartel _ expecting a stalemate _ was most likely to extend thecurrent production quota.   ``There's a degree of disappointment and confusion,'' said AlanSinclair, an oil analyst at the London investment firm Smith NewCourt Ltd.   Adding to the confusion was the departure of two Arab oilministers, with one expected to return by Tuesday but the othersaying he might not.   Mana Saeed Oteiba, the United Arab Emirates' oil minister, saidSunday he was returning to his country for consultations with hisgovernment and that he might or might not return. He gave no reasonfor his sudden departure.   Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Khalifa Sabah will leave today, butwill return in time for the Tuesday session, members of hisdelegation said.   Observers speculated that Sabah was going to London to appearbefore the British government's Monopolies and Mergers Commissionabout Kuwait's purchase of more than 20 percent of BritishPetroleum Co. earlier this year.   ``The fact that Oteiba must consult with his supeiors is veryreminiscent of a stall. It's awfully convenient, isn't it?'' saidPeter Gignoux, managing director of the international energydepartment at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in London.   Oil markets were disappointing today, with the spot price ofNorth Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crudeoil, falling to 55 cents to $15.30 a barrel and then held steady onthe spot market.   The 13 members of the cartel are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon,Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
