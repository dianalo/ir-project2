Background</ITAG>The Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982 (Title I, Subtitle C of the TaxEquity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-248)) amendedPart B of Title XI of the Social Security Act (the Act)) to establish theUtilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) program.The 1982 legislation provided that PROs assume the responsibilities thatpreviously had been assigned to Professional Standards Review Organizationsand fiscal intermediaries. Those responsibilities generally have includedthe review of health care services funded under Medicare (Title XVIII ofthe Act) to determine whether those services are reasonable and medicallynecessary, are furnished at the appropriate level of care, and are of aquality that meets professionally recognized standards. In addition, PROsmonitor and validate a sample of diagnostic and procedural informationsupplied by hospitals to fiscal intermediaries to establish the prospectivepayment amounts for hospitals.To carry out their responsibilities, PROs acquire information from themedical records of patients and from other records maintained by healthinstitutions, practitioners and claims payment agencies. In addition, theygenerate information regarding the quality, utilization, and appropriatenessof health care services. PROs use this information to develop and reviewprofiles (for example, practice patterns) in order to focus on practitioners,hospitals, and the assignment of discharges to diagnosis related groupsin order to assess the quality of care being furnished and to undertakenecessary corrective action. PROs transmit their determinations to intermediariesand carriers responsible for making payments under the Act.Regulations governing PRO activities are located in various parts of Title42 of the CFR (that is, Parts 405, 462, 466, 473, 476, 489, and 1004).Prior to the enactment of section 9403 of the Consolidated Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-272), Peer Review Organizations(PROs) have been authorized, under section 1154(a)(2) of the Act, to denyMedicare payment on the following bases:<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Reasonableness of services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Medical necessity of services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Appropriateness of the inpatient setting in which serviceswere furnished or are proposed to be furnished.</ITAG>PROs, however, were also required to assure that care provided to beneficiariesmet professionally recognized standards of health care. If the care providedto a beneficiary did not meet such standards, the PROs were required totake corrective action through_<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Education and advice to the physician or provider; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Intensified review if a pattern of quality problems was identified;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Imposition of sanctions such as exclusion of a provider ofhealth care services from the Medicare program or recovery of inappropriatepayments.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">However, they were not authorized to issue a Medicare denial of paymentfor substandard quality care.Under the PRO current contract and scope of work (that is, the scope ofPRO review), PROs are required to perform reviews for quality of care.They use several vehicles for conducting these reviews, such as genericquality screens or discharge review criteria. On the basis of their review,the PROs determine whether the quality of the services furnished to beneficiariesmeets professionally recognized standards of health care, and whether thequality of care is complete and adequate. When a quality concern is identifiedby a physician reviewer, the PROs impose quality interventions (other thandenial of payment) including education, intensified review, or, if appropriate,sanctions.Section 9403 of Pub. L. 99-272, however, amended section 1154(a)(2) ofthe Act ot give PROs the authority, effective April 7, 1986, to deny Medicarepayment to a physician or hospital for services furnished that are of substandardquality. Under the law, the PRO determinations to deny Medicare paymentfor these services are to be made on the basis of criteria that are consistentwith guidelines established by the Secretary. Under its provider agreement,a provider may not charge for services for which payment is denied becausethe services are of substandard quality.In addition, under section 4096(a) of the Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-203), which amended section 1842(b), 1842(1) and1870(f) of the Act, a physician who submits a claim or bill that is subsequentlydenied for substandard quality care must not charge a beneficiary any amountand must refund promptly any amount already collected from the beneficiary.Section 9352(b) of Pub. L. 99-509 requires by statute (for contracts enteredinto or renewed on or after January 1, 1987) that a PRO review the reasonsfor readmission of a patient to a hospital if the readmission occurs lessthan 31 days after the previous discharge. Prior to enactment of Pub. L.99-509, PROs reviewed readmissions that occurred within 15 days of a discharge.Section 1154(a)(13) of the Act provides that a readmission review mustbe conducted for at least a sample of patients who are readmitted within31 days after a discharge. That section further requires review of post-hospitalcare (that is, care furnished in a skilled nursing facility (SNF), homehealth agency (HHA), or hospital outpatient area) that occurs between twosuch hospital admissions.In addition, section 9353(a)(2) of Pub. L. 99-509 amended section 1154(a)(4)of the Act to require a review of the quality of care provided by healthmaintenance organizations (HMOs) and competitive medical plans (CMPs).This review may be conducted by PROs or by other organizations that areawarded competitive contracts. We are not proposing to deny Medicare paymentfor substandard quality care in these cases because there is no ``per service''payment to deny. Different interventions for quality issues are providedfor in these settings (for example, education, intensified review, andsanctions), in accordance with contracts with HCFA, to resolve qualityof care problems in HMOs/CMPs.Moreover, the amendment to section 1866(a) of the Act made by section 9353(e)of Pub. L. 99-509 expands the PRO authority by requiring hospitals, SNFsand HHAs to modify their agreements with the PRO to perform quality ofcare reviews as a condition of receiving Medicare payment. Section 9353(d)of Pub. L. 99-509 also provides a basis for funding PROs for this typeof review.We are developing guidelines for PROs to use in setting up criteria fordenials of substandard quality care provided by SNFs, HHAs, and outpatientarea, and intend to issue a separate proposed rule concerning such denials.Section 9353(c) of Pub. L. 99-509 amended section 1154(a) of the Act (addinga new paragraph (a)(14)) to require PROs, effective August 1, 1987, toconduct an appropriate review of all written complaints from beneficiariesor their representatives about the quality of services (for which paymentmay otherwise be made under Medicare) not meeting professionally recognizedstandards of health care. The PRO is to inform the beneficiaries or theirrepresentatives of the final disposition of the complaint including whetherservices meet professionally recognized standards of health care. Beforethe PRO determines that the quality of services does not meet professionallyrecognized standards of health care, the PRO must give the provider andphysician reasonable notice and an opportunity for discussion. We recognizethat implementation of this provision may result in the identificationof a practitioner or other individual concerned. This identification wouldbe unavoidable if the area of care is so unique or so specific that thenotification would implicitly identify the individual concerned. We areproposing to revise the current PRO disclosure regulations (andSection; 476.133)to provide for this possibility.Section 9353(e) of Pub. L. 99-509 amended sections 1866(a) and 1876(i)of the Act to require hospitals, SNFs, HHAs, risk-sharing HMOs (42 CFRPart 417, Subpart C), and CMPs to modify their agreements with PROs tohave the PROs perform additional functions as a condition of receivingMedicare payment. These modified agreements would require the PRO to performcertain functions under section 1154(a)(4) of the Act (such as qualityof care reviews under section 1154(a)(4)(A), and review of beneficiarycomplaints about quality of care under section 1154(a)(14)). However, undersection 1876(i) of the Act, risk-sharing HMOs and CMPs are exempt frommaintaining such an agreement if they are located in areas in which HCFAhas a contract with a non-PRO organization under section 1154(a)(4)(C)of the Act. Therefore, PROs are required to review beneficiary complaintsabout the quality of services furnished in a hospital, SNF, HHA, HMO orCMP (except for an HMO or CMP in a non-PRO contract area). Complaints aboutthe quality of HMO/CMP services would be reviewed by either the PRO (aswe are proposing in this rule) or by a non-PRO organization under the termsof its contract with HCFA.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Proposed Changes to the Regulations</ITAG>We are proposing to revise the following regulations to implement partsof section 1154(a) of the Act as amended by section 9403 of Pub. L. 99-272and section 9353(c) of Pub. L. 99-509 and parts of section 1842(b)(3) and1842(1)(1) as amended by section 4096(a) of Pub.

Discussion of Proposed Changes</ITAG>A. Quality of Care Review<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Denial of Medicare Payment Because of Substandard Care</ITAG>a. <T3>HCFA Guidelines. </T3>As discussed above, section 1154(a)(2) of theAct requires PROs to determine, on the basis of their review of the qualityof care furnished by a provider or physician, whether Medicare paymentsare to be made. The PROs are to determine if the quality of services furnishedto beneficiaries meets professionally recognized standards of health carethat are consistent with guidelines established by the Secretary.In order to establish guidelines for inpatient hospital services, we conveneda panel of 14 physicians on June 24-25, 1986. The members of the panelrepresented a broad range of health care interests. The consensus of thatpanel was that HCFA should develop general guidelines to be used by thePROs as opposed to specific or narrow guidelines. We subsequently met withrepresentatives of the health care industry and consumer interest groupsin developing the guidelines.In the addendum to this rule, we are setting forth the proposed guidelinesfor public comment. We will issue future rulemakings, as necessary, toset forth proposed changes to the guidelines. We will carefully reviewthe comments and may incorporate suggested changes in the guidelines priorto their publication as an addendum in the final rulemaking. The proposedguidelines are broad and represent a general framework. They identify themajor classes of admissions and the critical diagnostic and therapeuticprinciples within which each PRO is to develop more specific criteria reflectinglocal medical practice that PRO physician reviewers would use to determinewhether the quality of care was substandard.b. <T3>Level of Severity.</T3> Not every quality problem warrants a denialof payment. Some quality problems have no potential for a significant,adverse effect on a patient or do not present an imminent danger to thepatient. Other instances result in an actual, adverse effect on a patientor present an imminent danger to the patient. We believe that Medicarepayment should be denied for substandard quality care that results in eitherof the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; It results in an actual, significant, adverse effect on thebeneficiary, that is, patient management that results in_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Unnecessarily prolonged treatment of the patient;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Complications in medical conditions;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Readmission to the hospital;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Physiological or anatomical impairment;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Disability; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Death.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; It presents an imminent danger to the health, safety, orwell-being of the beneficiary, or places the beneficiary unnecessarilyin a high-risk situation, as as to constitute a gross and flagrant violationof the obligations set forth in section 1156 of the Act, on which the PROmay proceed in accordance with 42 CFR 1004.50.</ITAG>Under this proposed rule, the PRO would be responsible for determiningwhether a quality problem results in an actual, significant, adverse effectto the beneficiary or presents an imminent danger to the beneficiary andif so, if deny Medicare payment on the basis that the care was of substandardquality. For those instances that reflect quality problems, but which donot result in an actual, significant, adverse effect or present an imminentdanger to the beneficiary, we propose that Medicare payment be made andthat PROs conduct an appropriate followup through their quality interventionprocesses already in place. As noted above, these intervention processesinclude, but are not limited to, education, intensified review, and, ifappropriate, sanctions against the provider or physician. We note thatthese intervention processes (in addition to denial of payment) would beappropriate as well for instances of substandard quality care that resultin an actual, significant, adverse effect or present an imminent dangerto the beneficiary.c. <T3>Use of Health Care Professionals to Screen Cases.</T3> Before a PROphysician conducts a review, health care professionals other than physicianstypically screen cases for approval of Medicare payment based on necessityor appropriateness of care. A nurse reviewer performs an initial screenusing existing PRO criteria to review cases for reasonableness, medicalnecessity, and appropriationss of setting, and also for the quality ofcare. The nurser reviewer may approve nonquestionable cases (that is, casesin which all the screen criteria are met) but must refer any questionablecases to a physician for review. For determinations about reasonableness,medical necessity, and appropriateness of setting, the physician reviewermakes a determination based on his or her knowledge, expertise, and experiencerather than on set criteria.The concept of peer review requires that, whenever possible, PROs use physicianreviewers who practice in a setting similar to that in which the physicianwhose services are under review practices. This is the policy under whichPROs currently conduct their reviews, and we believe this practice becomeseven more significant in terms of quality of care cases. Under the currentscope of work, for initial denial cases, the physician reviewer need notbe a specialist in the field represented by the affected attending physician.However, a number of attending physicians have informed us that they believeit is inappropriate for the physician reviewer to conduct reviews otherthan in his or her specialty. In particular, it has been suggested thatthe quality of care reviews be conducted by physician reviewers with thesame specialty as the affected attending or consulting physician responsiblefor delivery of the care in question. Therefore, we are proposing for initialdenial determinations of substandard quality care that the physician reviewersbe a specialist in the field represented by the affected attending or consultingphysician responsible for delivery of the care in question, except whenmeeting this requirement would compromise the effectiveness or efficiencyof PRO review. For example, if the PRO staff did not include a certainspecialty physician-type, such as a cardiac surgeon, the effectivenessPRO review would be compromised in such a case.We are proposing that aPRO would have several options, however, as to how it meets this requirement.The PRO may use a specialist in the field represented by the affected attendingor consulting physician responsible for the delivery of the care in questionto perform the initial screening and make the initial denial determination.As an alternative, the PRO may use a nonspecialist or a specialist physicianin a different field than that of the affected attending or consultingphysician responsible for the delivery of the care in question to performthe initial screening. In this case, potential quality denial cases identifiedas a result of this screening process would then be subject to a secondlevel review by either_<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; A specialist physician in the field represented by the affectedattending or consulting physician responsible for the delivery of the carein question; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; A committee of specialists, at least one of which must bein the same field as that represented by the affected attending or consultingphysician responsible for the delivery of the care in question.</ITAG>The review method (and the number of physicians to make up the panel forthose PROs opting for committee review) must be specified in the PRO'splan, and subject to HCFA approval, to implement the denial authority.The physician specialist reviewer would make a determination about thequality of care based on criteria developed by the PRO in accordance withthe HCFA guidelines described in the addendum to this proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Provider and Physician Responsibility</ITAG>The PRO determines whether the provider or the physician is responsiblefor furnishing substandard quality care. The physician is considered tobe providing substandard care if, for example, he or she_<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Omits standard quality care;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Furnishes substandard quality care; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Orders substandard quality care.</ITAG>The hospital is considered to be responsible for the conduct of all services,(i.e., care or lack of care), in the hospital and, therefore, is responsiblefor all substandard quality care that is provided to a Medicare beneficiary.Medicare payment to the hospital would be denied for such services regardlessof whether the hospital or physician provided the substandard quality care.Prior to making an initial denial determination, the PRO affords the provideror supplier, or the beneficiary's attending or consulting physician responsiblefor delivery of the care in question, an opportunity to discuss the matterwith a PRO physician (andSection; 466.93). The PRO physician considers theadditional documentation or discussion in making an initial determination.If this information satisfies the PRO that quality care was furnished,the PRO would approve Medicare payment. If, however, the PRO physicianspecialist reviewer still believes, based on the quality of care criteria,his or her knowledge, medical expertise and judgment that a quality problemexists, the PRO would determine the level of severity for that problem.The beneficiary and the physician or the provider (or both, as appropriate)would be notified by the PRO of this determination and that payment isto be denied (as appropriate). If a pattern of substandard quality care cases occurs, the PRO would applyinterventions already in place to prevent further substandard quality care.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Financial Liability </ITAG>Section 9403(b) of Pub. L. 99-272 amended section 1866(a)(1) of the Actby adding a new paragraph (I) (subsequently redesignated as paragraph (K))that requires Medicare providers to agree_ <ITAG tagnum="21">Not to charge any individual or any other person for items or servicesfor which payment under this title is denied under section 1154(a)(2) byreason of a determination under section 1154(a)(1)(B). </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Accordingly, beneficiaries are not to be charged by providers forany of the costs of substandard care. That is, beneficiaries would notbe liable for any charges by providers for care for which payment is deniedbecause the care was of substandard quality. We are proposing to amendandSection; 489.21 to implement this provision. (Existing regulations atandSection;andSection; 489.40 and 489.41 require refunds of amounts that constituteincorrect collections under andSection; 489.21.) Deductibles and coinsuranceare not applicable and may not be collected or retained by providers withrespect to this care. The providers may charge beneficiaries, however,for convenience items and other services not usually covered by Medicare.For those cases in which the PRO physician specialist reviewer or panel,specializing in the same field as the physician whose services are beingreviewed, determines that the services were of substandard quality andthat the services resulted in an actual, significant, adverse effect onthe beneficiary, or presented an imminent danger to the health, safetyor well-being of the beneficiary, or places the beneficiary unnecessarilyin a high-risk situation, so as to constitute a gross and flagrant violationof the obligations set forth in section 1156 of the Act, on which the PROmay proceed in accordance with andSection; 1004.50, we would not pay eitherthe hospital or, if appropriate, the physician who is responsible for providingthe services. In addition, under section 1842(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act as amended by section4096 of Pub. L. 100-203, a physician who accepts assignment agrees notto charge a beneficiary for services denied because of substandard qualitycare and to refund any amount already collected for those services. Deductibleand coinsurance are not applicable and may not be collected or retained.A physician who violates the terms of an assignment is subject to all ofthe following:<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Civil sanctions under section 1128A of the Act and 42 CFRPart 1003. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Criminal penalties under section 1877 of the Act.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Revocation of his or her assignment privilege under andSection;405.1681.</ITAG>Under section 1870(f)(1) of the Act, as amended by section 4096(a) of Pub.L. 100-203, a physician who claims direct payment after the death of thebeneficiary is subject to the same obligations that apply to assigned claims.Under section 1842(l) of the Act as amended by section 4096(a) of Pub.L. 100-203, if a claim for physician services submitted on other than anassignment-related basis is denied because the services are of substandardquality, the physician must refund timely to the beneficiary any amountshe or she has collected for the services. Deductible and coinsurance arenot applicable to these services and, if collected, may not be retained.A physician who knowingly and willfully fails to make timely refunds maybe subject to sanctions under 42 CFR Parts 1001 and 1003. A refund would be considered to be made timely if_<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; The refund is made within 30 days after the date the physicianreceives the notice of denial unless the physician requests review of thedenial within that 30-day period; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; In the case of a physician who requested review of the denialwithin 30 days, the refund is made within 15 days after the date the physicianreceives notice of an adverse determination on his or her request for reviewof the denial. </ITAG>We would add a new andSection; 405.337 to the regulations and revise andSection;andSection;424.55 and 424.64 to implement the provisions concerning liability forphysician services for which payment is denied because the services areof substandard quality. In addition, under section 1842(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act as amended by section4096(a) of Pub. L. 100-203, we would make a technical correction by revisingandSection; 424.55(b) to provide that a physician who accepts assignmentmust refund any amounts already collected from the beneficiary (or fromsomeone on behalf of the beneficiary) if_<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Medicare payment has been made to the physician for servicesthat have been determined to be not reasonable and necessary under theprovisions of andSection; 405.310(k); </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; The beneficiary was found to be without fault in incurringthe charges; and </ITAG>andbullet; The determination that Medicare payment was incorrect was madesubsequent to the third year following the year in which the payment noticewas sent to the beneficiary.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Notification and Appeal</ITAG>We would require that the PRO notify the beneficiary and the provider orthe responsible physician (or both, as appropriate), and the fiscal intermediaryor carrier (or both, as appropriate) that it has determined that a Medicaredenial of payment was justified based on a determination that substandardquality care was furnished. In addition, the beneficiary would be notifiedof his or her liability for other charges, as appropriate. In section IIof the addendum to this proposed rule, we are providing samples of thedenial notice language that the beneficiary would receive.We have met with industry representatives, physicians, and associationsregarding the content of the beneficiary notification. We believe, basedon the advice of these interest groups, that it would be inappropriateto include detailed information regarding the substandard quality carein the notification letters. Other notification issues that we consideredinclude whether_andbullet; The beneficiary should be informed specifically as to how thecare was substandard;andbullet; We should summarize the details of the findings; andandbullet; We should advise the beneficiary to go to a physician of choicefor further consultation.We specifically request public comment on these issues.Under section 1155 of the Act, a beneficiary, provider, or physician whois dissatisfied with a PRO initial denial of Medicare payment because ofsubstandard quality care, may request a reconsideration by the PRO thatmade the initial denial determination. In addition, a beneficiary has theright to a hearing and judicial review on a determination regarding substandardquality care as specified in 42 CFR 473.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Subcontracting to Facilities</ITAG>Prior to the enactment of Pub. L. 99-272, PROs were allowed to subcontractwith a facility to conduct quality of care activities (that is, activitiesrelating to quality of care reviews and studies). Because section 9403of that statute will result in denial of Medicare payment for substandardquality care, we believe that it would be inappropriate (that is, a conflictof interest) for a facility to conduct such reviews of its own activities.Thus, we would require that the PRO be prohibited from subcontracting witha facility to conduct quality of care reviews that may affect Medicarepayment.B. PRO Review of Beneficiary ComplaintsSection 1154(a)(14) of the Act, as added by section 9353(c) of Pub. L.99-509, requires PROs to conduct an appropriate review of all written complaintsfrom beneficiaries or their representatives about the quality of services(for which payment may otherwise be made under Medicare) furnished by hospitals,SNFs, HHAs, risk-sharing HMOs and CMPs (except for HMOs and CMPs in whicha non-PRO is performing the review) not meeting professionally recognizedstandards of health care. Non-PRO organizations would conduct a reviewof beneficiary complaints about the quality of HMO/CMP services in accordancewith their contracts with HCFA. We would require that, in conducting anappropriate review of a beneficiary's complaint, the PRO_andbullet; Inform the beneficiary or the beneficiary's representatives whetheror not the quality of care meets professionally recognized standards ofhealth care, and the corrective action to be taken if necessary (that isdenial of payment, education, intensified review, or sanctions);andbullet; At least 30 days prior to disclosure, provide the physician orprovider concerned with notice of disclosure an opportunity for discussionon whether the quality of services does not meet professionally recognizedstandards of health care;andbullet; Disclose beneficiary-specific confidential information to thebeneficiary or the beneficiary's representative, as provided under andSection;476.132.We note that the nature of the complaint may be so unique or the servicein question so specific that implicit identification of an individual physicianconcerned could be an unavoidable consequence of compliance with section1154(a)(14) of the Act.We considered precluding PROs from providing any information to the beneficiarythat might identify the concerned physician or practitioner. However, webelieve that section 1154(a)(14) of the Act requires that the informationdiscussed above be provided to the beneficiary, which, in some cases, mayhave that unintended effect. We are proposing to amend andSection;andSection;466.70 and 466.106 and the PRO confidentiality regulations at andSection;476.133 to set forth these requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires us to prepare and publish an initialregulatory impact analysis for any proposed regulation that meets one ofthe E.O. criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely toresult in: An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or, significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. In addition, we generally preparean initial regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with theRegulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless theSecretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposesof the RFA, individuals are not small entities, but we treat all hospitalsand physicians as small entities. Athough PROs are not the kind of smallentities to which the Regulatory Flexibility Act is usually consideredto apply, because they are funded by us, and are our contractors, we customarilytreat them as small entities.We do not consider an economic impact on small entities to be significantunless their annual total costs or revenues would be increased or decreasedby at least three percent. We anticipate that PROs would deny claims onthe basis of substandard care for no more than one per cent of the casesthey review. Since they review about a quarter of all Medicare hospitaldischarges, we expect those denials would represent no more than one-fourthof one percent of all Medicare discharges, and since Medicare hospitalinpatient discharges account for less than one-half of all hospital discharges,an even smaller portion of total discharges. Therefore, we do not anticipatean increase or decrease of three percent.We have determined that the changes in this regulation do not meet anyof the criteria for a major rule under Executive Order 12291. In addition,for the above reasons, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies,that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities. We have, therefore, not prepareda regulatory flexibilty analysis.In addition, section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act requires the Secretaryto prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any rule that may have a significantimpact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.Such an analysis must also conform to the provisions of section 603 ofthe RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a smallrural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside ametropolitan statistical area. We have determined, and the Secretary certifies,that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact onthe operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

Guidelines </ITAG>The purpose of these guidelines is to provide a framework to the PROs fortheir formulation of criteria to be used in determining whether inpatienthospital care furnished to a beneficiary was of substandard quality. Forthose services in which substandard care is provided, the PROs would determinewhether the care furnished results in an actual, significant, adverse effector present an imminent danger to the health, safety, or well-being to thebeneficiary, as discussed in the preamble to this rule. In developing the guidelines, our medical staff identified major classesof admissions, significant milestones in the course of hospitalization,and salient diagnostic and therapeutic principles that should be consideredand acted upon by the physician in the management of a patient's courseof treatment. The course of treatment should be documented as a part ofthe beneficiary's medical record. The PROs would review the medical recordsfor the appropriateness of actions taken using critria developed by thePROs, to provide specificity and local relevance, in conjunction with theguidelines. <ITAG tagnum="71">A.
