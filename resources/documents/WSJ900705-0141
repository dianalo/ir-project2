The maker of the adhesive bandages and other health-careproducts is redoubling its efforts in an intensive campaignto become No. 1 in safety. But it won't be an easy feat.Pinning together its campaign is a set of strict rulesdetermining how a workplace accident is handled -- rules thathaven't always gone down easily with middle management.</LP><TEXT>   To win, Johnson andamp; Johnson must replace Du Pont Co., longthe acknowledged leader in preventing worker accidents andwork-related illnesses. Both companies appear to have incommon a zeal for workplace safety from the top down. &quot;Thecommon denominator of safety excellence is a company'sculture, which is determined by its chief executive officer,&quot;says Charles Hurley, a former National Safety Councilofficial.   Johnson andamp; Johnson's big push comes amid signs of a hotterregulatory spotlight on the issue; 1990s corporations andregulators may have to do more to make the workplace safe. Inthe 1980s, Reagan-administration deregulation turned a lot ofsuch spotlights off.   The Reagan policies led many employers to relax workersafety. Patrick Tyson, an official of the Labor Department'sOffice of Safety and Health Administration in the earlyReagan years and now an occupational safety and health lawyerin Atlanta, was a witness. He recalls: &quot;Industry was giventhe opportunity to do what they said they wanted to do.&quot; Inshort, they wanted to show how good their safety programscould be without being hogtied by federal regulation. OSHA'sinspection force was slashed.   &quot;Almost inevitably, with very few exceptions . . .industry responded with tremendous cuts in safety and healthstaffs,&quot; Mr. Tyson says, and safety and health &quot;went tohell.&quot; Many employers, through most of the decade,underreported worker injuries and on-the-job illnesses.   But now, Mr. Tyson says, companies are &quot;paying for&quot; theirpolicies in stiff fines and tougher enforcement which beganwhen Bill Brock became Mr. Reagan's second Labor secretary,and which has been escalating since, most lately underSecretary Elizabeth Dole and OSHA Chief Gerard Scannell.   Some recent OSHA targets have been big. OSHA has proposedfines of $5.7 million against Phillips Petroleum Co.,stemming from explosions last October at a Houston-areaplastics plant that killed 23 workers, and $7.3 million forhealth and safety violations by USX Corp. at two plants; OSHAcited Phillips internal documents &quot;that called for correctiveaction but which were largely ignored,&quot; and alleged&quot;corporate indifference to worker safety and health&quot; by USX.Phillips and USX are contesting the fines.   Lately, reported injury rates have been climbing, whichOSHA says reflects a trend toward more accurate reporting;many of its big fines have been for bad record-keeping.   But Johnson andamp; Johnson swam against the prevailing Eightiescurrent, Mr. Tyson notes. Even in the mostderegulation-obsessed days of the Reagan administration, thecompany was aggressively trying to improve workplace safety.Leading the effort was Mr. Scannell, who was brought in assafety director by then-President David Clare and who spent adecade at the company. He left OSHA in 1979 to join thehealth-care products maker; when he switched back to theagency in 1989, it was to become OSHA chief.   Johnson andamp; Johnson's pre-Scannell policies were a lotlooser. Routine yearly reports on injuries were about allthat was required. &quot;They talked a little about safety, butthey never did very much,&quot; says Mr. Tyson.   Mr. Scannell found his job cut out for him: Among thesloppy and unreliable recording of workplace injuries, ninepregnancies were logged as illnesses.   So, over a period of years, the company worked out toughworkplace-safety rules. When any workplace accident causes adeath, or an amputation, fracture, head injury or burnresulting in at least one lost workday, the head of thecompany unit involved must file a written report to thecompany's top management within 24 hours. The head personthen has to travel to company headquarters in New Brunswickand personally explain, to a top-level management committee,what went wrong.   The result of such efforts: Johnson andamp; Johnson has slashedits annual lost workday incidence, or LWDI, rate, per 100workers to 0.14 last year from 1.81 in 1981. These are therates of job-related injuries or illnesses that forceemployees to lose at least a full workday.   By contrast, the lost workday case rate for 14 largecompeting pharmaceutical concerns in 1988 was 1.20. Overallrates for the pharmaceutical industry and the surgicalappliances and supplies industry, in which Johnson andamp; Johnsoncompetes, were much higher than that, government reportsshow.   The company's rate has flattened out over the past fewyears. So Johnson andamp; Johnson is redoubling efforts. RalphLarsen, the new chairman, has picked up the torch, setting acompany goal of &quot;an injury-free work environment.&quot; Johnson andamp;Johnson will adopt some new methods: designing safety intoproduction equipment, spotting accident &quot;near-misses&quot; andeliminating their causes, and urging workers to report safetyviolations.   The rigid mandate for injury reports and other Johnson andamp;Johnson safety edicts has often riled managers, particularlyin overseas subsidiaries where safety traditions aresometimes far weaker. When a company worker in Kenya lost anarm in a textile machine in 1987, the manager complained toMr. Scannell that flying to New Brunswick used up a year'stravel budget. The manager made the trip anyway.   Many U.S. and foreign managers once protested a plan byMr. Scannell to equip all plants and offices with sprinklersto give workers time to escape a fire. One official said theestimated $100 million cost would be too much at the sametime the company was involved in a costly recall of itsTylenol headache capsules because of the poisoned-Tylenolscare. Chairman James Burke, recently retired, asked: Whilethe company is protecting its customers, &quot;can we do less forour employees?&quot; The sprinkler project went on.   While its overall safety numbers look good, there are somerough spots. One union official, David Presseisen, presidentof Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Local 630, whichrepresents several Johnson andamp; Johnson facilities, praises thecompany's efforts. But Eric Frumin, an official of the sameunion, insists that safety performance at its nonunionfacilities &quot;varies a lot, and can be terrible.&quot;   A nonunion Noramco plant in Delaware, for example, has hadan LWDI rate of 1.983 in 1987 and 1.738 in 1988 -- far worsethan the overall corporation's rate. Johnson andamp; Johnsonfigures show that it had many U.S. union and nonunion plantswith no lost workdays in 1987 and 1988; for the others, thenonunion performance was somewhat worse than at union plants,but rates for even nonunion plants were mostly below 1.0.   Currently, OSHA investigators are looking into somepossible record-keeping violations at another Johnson andamp;Johnson plant.   And Johnson andamp; Johnson has a ways to overtake Du Pont. Thechemical-products conglomerate's mainline operations have hadLWDI rates of 0.048, 0.038 and 0.05 in 1987, 1988 and 1989,respectively. Fully 14 Du Pont plants with more than 10million hours without a lost workday are on the NationalSafety Council's honor roll; two had a string of more than 40million hours.   Still, Du Pont has its share of detractors. William Golt,president of the Chemical Workers Association, a unit of a DuPont company union at Deep Water, N.J., contends that DuPont, like many employers, tries to hold down its injury-ratefigures by keeping injured employees on the job when theyshouldn't be working. The company denies this.   ---                    Making Safety Count                                                                                                          Lost workday cases from job-related injuries and illnesses(Annual rates, per 100 workers)                                                                                                                                MAKERS OF  MAKERS OF                          SURGICAL    PHARMA-                        APPLIANCES   CEUTICAL   JOHNSON                   ALL         AND   PREPARA-         andamp;                  MFG.
