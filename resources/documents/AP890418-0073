Ginsburg says it sometimes needs to beinvisible as well.   Ginsburg proved his point by deleting two-thirds of his dissentin a case before releasing it publicly. Ginsburg said he waswithholding 12 of the 18 pages because his opinion was based onsecret government information, The Washington Post and TheWashington Times reported today.   Civil liberties lawyers were quick to criticize the highlyunusual procedural step, and one likened it to secret actions ofthe notorious Star Chamber that existed in England until 1641.   ``It's bad enough to have secret evidence,'' said Kate Martin,director of the American Civil Liberties Union project on nationalsecurity litigation. ``His dissent is an effort to write secretlaw.''   Ginsburg's opinion was issued in a suit alleging the FBI, aspart of its domestic surveillance program of the 1950s and 1960s,engaged in illegal activity to discredit a New York man who was aCommunist Party member.   The plaintiff alleged that government agents planted afictitious report in a car he used, causing Communist Party membersto think he was a government informant and expel him from the partyin 1964.   The government wanted the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia to order a lower court to dismiss the case withouthearing it because it didn't want to release material that thedefense wanted to obtain through pre-trial discovery proceedings.The appeals court rejected the government request.   The appeals court majority said the government had not presentedcompelling evidence that disclosure of its activities 20 and 30years ago would result in disclosure of state secrets today.   But Ginsburg, whose nomination to the Supreme Court waswithdrawn two years ago after it was revealed he had smokedmarijuana, said the lower court had ignored the government's``legitimate and compelling interest in preventing disclosure ofexceedingly sensitive national security information,'' thenewspaper said.   However, major portions of the judge's dissent were deleted fromthe version released publicly and also from that given to theplaintiff's lawyers. Only government lawyers were allowed to seethe full version.   The Post and Times said court officials could not remember anyother instances in which the appellate court here had issued asecret opinion.   Mark Lynch, former head of the ACLU national security project,told the Post: ``This is unusual and goes further than any case I'maware of. On the face of it, it's troubling. Our whole system oflaw depends on court decisions being public.''</TEXT></DOC>
