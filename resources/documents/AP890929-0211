(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Tracy Chapman and Melissa Etheridgerecorded followups to their popular debut albums this year, theyturned to the same producers, same musicians and, in Chapman'scase, even the same microphone used the first time around.   It remains to be seen, of course, if they can duplicate thesuccess.   Answers will come soon. Etheridge's ``Brave and Crazy'' wasreleased in mid-September and Chapman's ``Crossroads'' followed afew weeks later.   They'll be trying to defy one of the music business' toughestobstacles _ the sophomore jinx. Music history is replete withartists who crumbled under the high expectations caused bysuccessful debut albums. Remember the Knack? Others who fell victimto the jinx include Christopher Cross, Meat Loaf, Cyndi Lauper andHuman League.   The Grammy Award-winning Chapman burst onto the scene last year,selling 3 million copies of a folk album filled with gentle lovesongs and pointed political barbs.   In contrast to Chapman, whose album was an instant,precedent-shattering success, Etheridge started slowly. But heralbum of smoldering rock tunes reached gold status (500,000 sales)when word spread of her bracing live performances.   Etheridge seemed to sum up the approach of both artists to theirsophomore efforts when she talked of her already-recorded new albumduring an April interview.   ``There's nothing outrageously different,'' she said. ``It'sjust the next step. Technically, musically, it's the same thing.''   Etheridge's manager, Bill Leopold, wouldn't allow her to beinterviewed this fall about the new album, both because he didn'twant her to be mentioned in the same article with another femaleartist and nervousness over the sophomore effort, said SandySowatka, a publicist at Island Records.   Paranoia is a frequent response to second album pressures.Artists can tie their stomachs in knots worrying about which way toturn. Should they use the same approach as the first album and hearaccusations that they're repeating themselves or change styles andrisk alienating the people who made them a success?   ``Both of those thoughts occurred to me,'' said DavidKershenbaum, who co-produced ``Crossroads'' with Chapman.   ``What it was on the first album was basically her and herguitar with us filling in the blanks,'' Kershenbaum said. ``That'swhat we did on this new record. We didn't do any more and we didn'tdo any less. Even though we didn't consciously try, the recordturned out differently.''   Chapman also wouldn't talk about the new record, but her suddenfame is clearly on her mind. The title cut of ``Crossroads'' talksabout pressures she faced to ``sell your soul'' and concludes withthe admonition, ``All you demons go back to hell.''   ``She was very clear when she came in and very strong,''Kershenbaum said. ``I didn't detect any insecurity at all, nowherenear what could have been with the pressure of a followup recordlike this.''   That wasn't the case with some of the musicians, who were alittle nervous, he said.   Musicians Larry Klein, Denny Fongheiser and Jack Holder all makereturn appearances backing Chapman. New guests include Neil Young,``Saturday Night Live'' guitarist G.E. Smith and former Bob Dylanviolinist Scarlet Rivera. Chapman used some new guitars, but askedfor the same microphone to duplicate vocals from her debut.   The mix of personal and world politics on ``Crossroads'' isroughly the same as on the first record. ``Freedom Now'' is aboutjailed South African leader Nelson Mandela, and ``Material World''is bitter in its denunciation of upwardly mobile people who forgettheir roots.   Both Chapman and Etheridge seem to have stockpiled material totide them over in case of writer's block. Some of the publishingcredits on Chapman's songs date to 1982 and 1984, while Etheridgehas been performing several of the ``Brave and Crazy'' songs formore than a year.   Expectations seem to differ slightly for both records.   Chapman's record is out in time for the Christmas buying season,but her record company seems to be positioning Chapman as an artistof longevity, such as Dylan or Joni Mitchell, said Paul Grein,author of Billboard magazine's ``Chart Beat'' column. It's alsosignificant that the record is out 15 months after the debut, hesaid.   Anticipation for ``Crossroads'' is ``not as high as it would beif she had waited longer,'' Grein said. ``It would have put morepressure on her. She was smart to come fairly quickly and get thefollowup out of the way.''   Etheridge's management, by contrast, seems poised to make theKansas-born artist a star. The single ``No Souvenirs'' came out amonth in advance of the album to whet the audience's appetite, andEtheridge is booked for five nights later this month at the BottomLine, New York City's industry showcase club.   ``She's positioned very well,'' Grein said. ``The first albumdid well and got a great critical reaction but wasn't a home run. Ithink she's in a good position to go further with this album.''   Such songs as ``No Souvenirs,'' ``The Angels'' and ``Skin Deep''have sweeping rock hooks well designed for frequent radio airplay.Etheridge is still sifting through the shards of shatteredrelationships for her best material, but the new record is harderrocking, less downbeat than the first.   Again, her acoustic guitar _ which is attacked more often thanstrummed _ is at the center of her band's sound. Etheridge producedthe record with Kevin McCormick and Niko Bolas, just like the debut.   Kershenbaum, whose own career has blossomed with interest in theminimalist style he and Chapman used on the first album, isphilosophic about the sophomore pressure.   ``A lot of people are going to be very interested in seeing howthe second album does. Did she beat it? Does it sound the same? Wasshe lucky the first time?'' he said. ``What happens with a recordlike that, when we have that much exposure, is that we come to batin a really heavy posture on the next one.   ``If we did our job well and people like our songs, then that'sgoing to help us. If they don't like the songs, then no matter whatwe did, it's not going to mean anything.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thursday, Oct. 5</NOTE></DOC>
