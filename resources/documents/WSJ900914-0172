The lawsuit, filed earlier this week in federal court inDallas, accuses Mr. Aubin of using $14.2 million in proceedsfrom a Western loan to purchase a Kentucky horse farm. Theentire loan was supposed to finance the purchase of a tractof land in North Dallas.</LP><TEXT>   The suit was filed by Sunbelt Savings FSB, which took overWestern's assets in August 1988, about two years afterWestern's failure. The suit is one of at least three pendingagainst Mr. Aubin in connection with losses at Texas thrifts,and he is among the targets of a federal criminalinvestigation into the failures of two thrifts. Neither Mr.Aubin nor his attorneys could be reached for comment.   The suit filed this week is based on a $29 million loanthat Mr. Aubin and his partners obtained from Western in 1984for the purported purchase of a tract of land in northDallas. The suit alleges that the loan amount was inflated bya fraudulent land appraisal, enabling Mr. Aubin to siphon off$14.2 million for the purchase of the horse farm. Sunbeltclaims that Western's losses grew to $40 million throughother, unpaid loans for development of the Dallas property.   Mr. Aubin was forced to seek the funds from WesternSavings after former Texas Savings and Loan Commissioner L.Linton Bowman III blocked Mr. Aubin from obtaining any moreloans from two Houston-based thrifts, Mercury SavingsAssociation and Ben Milam Savings Association, according tothe lawsuit. State and federal thrift laws limit the amountof loans from one institution to one borrower.   A separate lawsuit, brought by the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., alleges that the officers and directors ofMercury and Ben Milam contributed to the failures of thethrifts. That suit also alleges that Mr. Aubin controlled thethrifts and their lending activities although he didn't serveas either an officer or director of the institutions. Thesuit is pending in federal court in Houston.   Another lawsuit being pursued by the FDIC in federal courtin Houston seeks to collect about $16 million in unpaid loansfrom Mercury and Ben Milam to Mr. Aubin and his companies,according to an attorney working for the FDIC.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation in Houston isconducting &quot;an active investigation&quot; of the failures ofMercury and Ben Milam, according to the FBI agent in chargeof the probe. Mr. Aubin hasn't been charged with any criminalactivities in connection with the thrift failures.</TEXT></DOC>
