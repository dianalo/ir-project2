The device, to be available this fall, is 5 inches wide, 2 1/2 inches deep and 8 inches high with a liquid-crystal screen that is 3 inches wide on the diagonal. The hand-held device receives television signals and has a built-in videocassette player that uses Sony's 8mm format.    &quot;Personal video will change consumer life styles on the same scale as the Walkman,&quot; said Masaaki Morita, the chairman of Sony of America, a unit of Sony Corp. of Japan.    Some analysts were skeptical, however, about the new product's list price. &quot;There's risk in carrying around a $1,300 piece of equipment in your brief case,&quot; said George K. Hersh Jr., an analyst with Diawa Securities America.    The Video Walkman is aimed at making it convenient to watch videotapes anywhere, anytime. But the 8mm format is incompatible with the dominant VHS format currently used for most consumer videocassettes. </TEXT></DOC>
