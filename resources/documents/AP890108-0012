(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tornadoes tore through several Illinois,Indiana and Kentucky towns Saturday, injuring more than 40 peopleand destroying a third of the homes and commercial buildings in thistown, officials said.   The tornado cut through a 10-square-block area and ``most homesare flattened and businesses are destroyed'' in that area, saidWabash County Sheriff Randy Grounds from an emergency command postin the local bank.   About 35 percent of the town's 275 buildings were demolished andhalf were damaged to some extent, said Grounds.   Mayor Jack Loeffler estimated that six to eight people had beentemporarily trapped ``in rubble, but I think they've all beenrescued.''   He said all but four or five people had been accounted for bymid-evening in the town of 600, and emergency workers searcheddoor-to-door to make sure no one remained trapped. Allendale isthree miles from the Indiana border, about 130 miles east of St.Louis.   ``There were numerous injuries, but as far as we know, nofatalities,'' said Trooper Harry Sutton of the Illinois State Police.   The only fire house in the rural community was destroyed and theonly school was heavily damaged, according to Grounds.   June Lofton, spokeswoman for Wabash General Hospital in nearbyMount Carmel, said 39 people, including at least six children, weretreated for injuries ranging from cuts and scratches to spinalinjuries.   ``We're talking about people who were buried under buildings ...major injuries,'' she said.   Lofton said at least 10 people were admitted and six weretransferred to other area hospitals.   ``People's houses were blown away with them in them,'' Loftonsaid. ``It's really been quite a disaster.''   Gerald Waldroup, administrator of Lawrence County MemorialHospital, about 25 miles north of Allendale, said five people werebrought to the emergency room. Four were treated for scratches andcuts. The fifth, an 18-month-old boy with a head injury, wastransferred to an Indiana hospital.   Minutes before the tornado stuck Allendale, twisters hit nearbyMill Shoals and Albion, officials said. A tornado later struck anarea south of Vincennes, Ind., but Allendale appeared to have beenhit the worst, they said.   Thunderstorms moved into Missouri, Indiana and Illinois,producing golf ball-size hail near Carbondale, Ill., and nearWashington, Ind., the National Weather Service said.   The storm system, which originated in Illinois, appeared to havelost strength as it moved in a northeasterly direction throughsouthwestern Indiana, authorities said.   Near Vincennes, which is on the Illinois border 40 miles north ofEvansville, two people were treated for minor cuts at Good SamaritanHospital in Vincennes after their mobile home south of the city wasblown over, said hospital nursing supervisor Janet Sheirmann.   Knox County Sheriff Don Kirkum said the tornado struck an areasoutheast of the city known as Saint Thomas about 6:45 p.m.   ``Damaged or destroyed were approximately 30 homes and 25 to 30farm buildings,'' Kirkum said in a statement released to the mediaabout 11:30 p.m. ``Most power and telephones are not operable atthis time, and it is not known how long it will be before service isrestored.''   In the Indiana town, children wept inside a car outside theirhome, which appeared to have been destroyed with its roof and sidesripped away. It was one of at least half a dozen homes damaged alonga single road in Vincennes.   ``I don't know what it was,'' said the man inside the car.   The storm struck Vincennes Lincoln High School on the city'ssouthside and knocked out power during a junior varsity basketballgame. The remainder of the game and the varsity contest that was tohave followed were postponed.   Dispatcher Bob Street of the Martin County Sheriff's Departmentsaid extra officers were on duty ``in case something happens.''   A spokesman for the Starke County sheriff's department said ithad received reports of homes damaged near Knox.   In Kentucky, officials said a tornado touched down in thesouth-central town of Franklin late Saturday night, causing somedamage to businesses and homes.   A dispatcher for the Franklin City Police said a Fordautodealership was ``practically destroyed'' and several apartmentbuildings were damaged in the east and south ends of the communityof 7,700.   There were no initial reports of injuries or fatalities.   The National Weather Service in Louisville said the tornado wasreported about 10:38 p.m.   Meanwhile in Wisconsin, thick fog covered much of the state,interfering with airport travel in the area. At 6 p.m., visibilitywas reduced to a quarter mile at Mitchell International Airport inMilwaukee.   Airport spokesmen said some flights were diverted or delayed,affecting about 80 percent of the day's normal traffic.   The Milwaukee Bucks professional basketball team could not gethome by plane from Baltimore because of fog at Mitchell andChicago's O'Hare airport, team spokesman Bill King said.   The players landed instead at Grand Rapids, Mich., ``the nearestthey could get,'' and resumed their trip by bus, King said. It meantpostponement by at least an hour of Saturday night's game inMilwaukee against the Utah Jazz.</TEXT></DOC>
