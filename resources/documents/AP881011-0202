A faulty O-ring was blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion ofthe shuttle Challenger and the deaths of all seven astronautsaboard.   Engineers worked around the clock at Cape Canaveral to takeapart the solid rocket motors that helped launch the DiscoverySept. 29, said Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab.   ``They disassembled the joints and then they did a visualinspection of the O-rings,'' Raab said. ``They looked for soot,charring, and there was none.''   The seals might have been marred if gas from solid propellantburning inside the motors reached them, but there was no evidencethat hot gases reached any of the 24 O-rings that had beeninspected as of Tuesday, Raab said.   After separating from the shuttle two minutes into flight, theboosters fell by parachute into the Atlantic Ocean and were towedto shore the next day.</TEXT></DOC>
