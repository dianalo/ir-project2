The Rev. Mike Baldock, pastor of the independent New CovenantChurch and organizer of the July 22-24 crusade at Market SquareArena, says he believes about 8,000 people will attend each of thethree meetings planned this weekend.   Swaggart has not preached outside Louisiana since February, whenhe tearfully admitted sinning against God and his family. Aprostitute in suburban New Orleans said Swaggart, of Baton Rouge,paid her to perform lewd acts.   The Assemblies of God dismissed Swaggart on April 8, after herefused an order to refrain from preaching for a year and receiveprofessional counseling. He returned to the pulpit of hisindependent ministry May 22.   Juleen Turnage, a spokeswoman at the Assemblies of Godheadquarters in Springfield, Mo., said individual pastors mustdecide whether to support the Indianapolis crusade.   Officials of the Northwest Assembly of God Church here ``made adecision not to cooperate'' with the crusade in any way, saidLucille Sexton, an aide to the Rev. Blanche Fiscus.   ``Pastors have had instructions'' from the national and stateoffices of the Assemblies of God not to have anything to do withSwaggart activities, Sexton said.   ``I would be surprised if any Assemblies of God peopleattended,'' she added.   The Rev. Charles Shank, district superintendent of thePentecostal denomination, also said pastors have been advised notto support or cooperate with Swaggart.   ``He has been disciplined by the church and isn't part of ourfellowship,'' Shank said.   Baldock said he has had no trouble recruiting more than 500volunteers, 200 ushers and a security force to help with theweekend revival meetings.   ``Market Square Arena provides a security force (for the arena),but we provide one for the security of Brother Swaggart,'' he said.   ``You always end up with some people who are hecklers,'' Baldocksaid, adding that he is concerned some people might try to bringbanners derogatory to Swaggart into the arena.   The Rev. Delores Fisher of the non-denominational Bethel Chapelsaid she believes many members of the Assemblies of God will turnout for Swaggart.   ``I think a lot of them will go,'' she said. ``Preachers are nodifferent from the laity. They shouldn't be scorned because theyare human.''</TEXT></DOC>
