The rally Saturday was described by the opposition as the biggest in Chile's history. Its leaders put the attendance at about one million, but independent observers suggested a figure of about half that. The regime conceded there may have been 130,000. What was clear was that the demonstration -- by being peaceful, ordered and very large -- successfully culminated a campaign that has sought to counter the junta's insistence that the only alternative to it is violence and communism.    Gen. Pinochet reacted swiftly. Abruptly reversing a conciliatory tone in which he has sought to portray himself as a benign elder statesman and has gone so far as to apologize for errors he may have committed, he went on national television to warn bluntly that open elections would be won by Marxists &quot;who would occupy the presidential seat.&quot; His concluding remark was, &quot;Let us not destroy Chile.&quot;    Shortly afterwards, mysterious power cuts affected much of the country and were attributed by the regime to terrorist attacks on electrical pylons.    In Wednesday's plebiscite, Chileans will vote yes or no to Gen. Pinochet extending his rule until 1997. He seized power in a 1973 military coup in which the democratically elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende, died.    If the 'no' vote wins, the general must call open presidential elections by the end of next year. According to the 1980 constitution drafted by the armed forces, he would remain in power until a new president took office in March 1990.    The 'no' campaign, in which 16 opposition parties have united after years of squabbling, is looking for an overwhelming victory as a means to accelerate Gen. Pinochet's eventual departure and force amendment of a constitution that gives extensive powers to the military.    Such a convincing victory appears possible, but remotely so. Gen. Pinochet, meanwhile, has often appeared faltering and incoherent in his television appearances. Few have given much credence to his intermittent attempt to appear as a moderate committed to democracy. </TEXT></DOC>
