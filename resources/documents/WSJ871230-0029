Under the catchall spending bill for the current fiscal year, which was passed by Congress shortly before Christmas, 20 states will be allowed to raise the speed limit on certain noninterstate highways for four years. The provision applies only to roads that have four lanes, are divided and are built to the safety standards required for interstate highways.    The law works on a first-come, first-served basis: The first 20 states to notify the Federal Highway Administration that they are raising their speed limits will be the ones permitted to do so. The limit was a concession to opponents who predicted that higher speed limits would result in an increase in highway deaths.    The states that have notified the agency of plans to raise the speed limit on some rural noninterstate highways are California, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia. An agency spokeswoman said she expects to add Minnesota to the list today.    Legislation passed by Congress last spring permits states to increase the speed limit on rural interstate highways to 65 mph. So far, 38 states have done so. According to preliminary estimates by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, traffic fatalities rose 46% last summer from the summer of 1986 on interstate highways where the speed limit has been increased. But the agency contends that the data aren't complete enough to draw conclusions on the effect of the higher speed limit. </TEXT></DOC>
