KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The new U.S.-Soviet nuclear missile pact isseriously flawed but its defeat in the Senate would be apolitically unacceptable blow to the unity of the NATO alliance,two national security experts say.   Richard Perle, who recently stepped down as assistant secretaryof defense for international security affairs, is trying topersuade the Senate to change the medium-range missile treaty.   He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday thatthe pact should permit the United States to deploy medium-range,ground-launched cruise missiles armed with non-nuclear explosives.   But Perle said that if it became clear such an amendment wouldhave the effect of killing the treaty, ``I would not favor it.''   Retired Army Gen. Bernard Rogers, until recently the supremeallied commander in Europe, told the committee that he believes thetreaty overall will have an adverse impact on the militarysituation in Europe. He said U.S. Pershing missiles, which are tobe destroyed under the treaty, are the one weapon that can strikewith assurance deep into Soviet territory from Western Europe.   But he said the Senate is faced with a no-win situation becauseit would be almost impossible politically for the United States tokeep its medium-range nuclear missile force in Europe, even if thetreaty were defeated.   ``I would say that failure to ratify might well have a majornegative impact on NATO and the future viability of the alliance,''Rogers said.   He said the alliance must now insist on modernizing its force ofshort-range nuclear weapons remaining in Europe as a hedge againstSoviet aggression.   Both Perle and Rogers questioned whether Soviet compliance withthe new treaty could be adequately verified.   But in closed-door hearings before the Senate IntelligenceCommittee, a different sort of worry surfaced about the treaty'sverifications provisions.   The concern centered on the on-site inspection provisions of thetreaty, which apply to both sides and permit teams of Sovietofficials access to certain U.S. missile facilities.   ``I think on-site inspection presents problems,'' said onecommittee source. ``One of the things we're trying to figure out ishow to keep tabs on the Soviets who are coming here.   ``It's for sure they're going to be interested in a lot morethan looking at Disneyland,'' the source said, speaking oncondition he not be identified by name.   The FBI has responsibility for counter-intelligence, but FBIofficials have balked at taking on the job of watching the Sovietinspectors, said committee sources.   Instead, they reported, FBI officials have suggested that theArmy should be given the task.   Meanwhile, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate ArmedServices Committee, reporting on a week-long trip by Senate leadersto Europe, said he found a European consensus for modernizingshort-range nuclear weapons, but no agreement on which weapons tobuild.   Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said European leaders toldthe senators ``that the INF treaty should be approved withoutamendments and that following that, NATO should proceed withmodernizing those ground-based nuclear weapons that are eligibleunder the treaty.''</TEXT></DOC>
