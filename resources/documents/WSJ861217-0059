Pawnee Acquisition was established by Pawnee Industries management and by Sterling Group Inc., a Houston-based investment banking concern that plans to acquire the Wichita, Kan.-based plastics company for $26.5 million in a leveraged buyout.    Under the offer, which was to expire yesterday, about 98% of the debentures outstanding had been tendered, or $12.3 million of the $12.5 million issue. The offer for Pawnee Industries required that at least $6,375,000 face amount of the debentures be tendered. Pawnee Acquisition said it won't extend the offer beyond Friday.    In a leveraged buyout, a company is taken private in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. </TEXT></DOC>
