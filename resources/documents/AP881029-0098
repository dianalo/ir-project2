Carlucci, who arrived here Friday, held lunch talks with Husseinat his palace.   The defense secretary then led the American delegation at ameeting of the Jordanian-American Joint Military Commission. PrimeMinister Zaid Rifai and the army's commander in chief, Field MarshalZeid bin Shaker, led the Jordanian delegation.   The two sides ``reviewed issues of mutual concern and means ofcooperation'' and discussed ``the general situation in the region,''according to the official Petra news agency.   The committee oversees the use of about $50 million in U.S.military aid. Jordan's 70,000-member military, which trains some ofits troops in the United States, participates in maneuvers withAmerican forces and uses American tanks, artillery, anti-aircraftmissiles and fighter planes.   Jordan has begun to reduce its heavy military reliance on theUnited States after Congress refused to upgrade weapons systems to alevel competitive with those used by Israel, Syria and otherneighboring countries.   In 1986, Congress blocked a proposed $1.9 billion sale of jetfighters and anti-aircraft weapons to Jordan, and Hussein vowednever again to seek major U.S. weapons systems.   The king has continued to encourage U.S. efforts to solve theArab-Israeli conflict. Hussein, however, has insisted that thePalestine Liberation Organization must approve or take part in anypeace negotiations.   Carlucci said in a speech last week that U.S. arms sales tomoderate Arab governments would help make them secure enough towelcome efforts to negotiate peace with Israel.   He also warned that as a result of rejection of arms sales to theArabs, countries such as Great Britain, France, China, and theSoviet Union ``are moving into the highly desirable positions ofconfidence and influence which America has traditionally enjoyed.''</TEXT></DOC>
