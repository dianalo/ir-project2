Spend $6,495 for Calera's TopScan Professional.andP;  If OCR is going to bea way of life, you ought to have professional tools for the job.andM;TopScan Pro is a hardware/software product for PS/2s and AT compatibles: Acoprocessor card carrying a Motorola 68020 and 4MB of RAM goes into afull-length slot, and more than 13MB of software goes onto your hard disk.andO;(The second thing you should probably do is buy a 300MB hard disk.)
