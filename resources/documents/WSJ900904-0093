Now that the census is computerized, the count can becompared with birth, death and other records to assess itsaccuracy. These comparisons show that past censuses missedminority men in poor central-city neighborhoods.   Census Bureau officials say they have enough safety netsin place to catch the people who fell through the broad meshof this year's mail questionnaire and personal follow-upcalls. One is a detailed review by local officials currentlyunder way against local records such as utility hookups.Another is a series of computerized checks of completedcensus forms. Statistician Clifford Clogg of PennsylvaniaState University told a recent congressional hearing, &quot;In myjudgment, our Census Bureau is the world leader on suchtechnology for checking data.&quot;   Mr. Clogg and other statisticians who participated in theannual meeting of the American Statistical Association lastmonth said they are satisfied with the census procedures.These include a check provided by a nationwide sample surveyjust drawing to a close. This survey would provide numbers toadjust the final counts statistically, as several largecities and states have requested.   Next July 15, the secretary of commerce will announce hisdecision for or against such an adjustment. Given thecriteria his office has developed, many experts say anegative decision is inevitable. That will send the citiesand states back to court and delay the release of detailedcensus data. Meanwhile, the broad, presumably final countsthat the bureau will deliver for reapportionment to Congressby Dec. 31 will carry a warning that they are subject toadjustment.                                                                                                          Figures Confirm Trends   In Migratory Patterns                                                                                                          BEFORE Washington considers the census numbers final, thetally will rise. But in some places, it's already plentyhigh.   The preliminary census figures confirm the diagonalmovement of Americans from North and East to South and West.The winners get political power in the form of more seats inCongress. California alone will gain seven seats, giving it52. New York, now barely the second largest state, willprobably drop to 31 seats, according to the Washington, D.C.,consulting firm Election Data Services.   But California, now home to nearly one in eight Americans,isn't crowing. Its water and road systems are alreadystrained by population growth. Even laissez faire Los Angeleshas a corps of water police this summer, watching for signsof illicit lawn watering. So, many Californians wonder whenthe migration will end.   The answer appears to be: not anytime soon. Nearly 60% ofCalifornia's growth in the 1980s came from migration, doublethe national rate, Census Bureau estimates show.   Much of this migration comes from abroad. JusticeDepartment figures show California is by far the preferreddestination of immigrants. The state has a built-in magnet inits large Hispanic and Asian-American populations. Immigrantsgenerally go where their fellow countrymen have gone beforethem.   No matter how bad its water or air problems, Californiawill still attract migrants so long as opportunities thereoutweigh opportunities elsewhere. It may not be the paradiseit used to be, but it will have to become a purgatory beforepotential migrants decide to stay home.                                                                                                          Businesses May Find   Limited Use for Data                                                                                                          DETAILED census data probably will be delayed by theadjustment-for-undercount debate. This delay will limit theusefulness of the 1990 census for business.   Even if the current schedule is met, tabulations linkingdemographics and dollars by neighborhood won't be availableuntil 1992. And unlike wines, data for business use don'timprove with age.   Moreover, users are beginning to question just howaccurate the detailed data will be. New York City demographerEvelyn Mann says the emergency procedures the Census Bureauused to boost its response rate &quot;thinned&quot; the sample ofhouseholds that filled out the detailed questionnaire. One ineight households was supposed to fill out the longerquestionnaire in neighborhoods that contained 2,000 or morehousing units, one in six households elsewhere.   But the emergency procedures, such as taking the censusover telephone hot lines, or getting information fromneighbors about housing units that didn't respond to repeatedcalls, limited the number of units in the long-form sample.Ms. Mann says the data will be biased toward those whocooperated with the census -- namely older, better-educatedAmericans.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE COST of counting each housing unit in 1980 dollarsrose from $5 in 1950 to $12 in 1980, and will reach anestimated $17 in 1990, according to the General AccountingOffice. . . . General Motors marketing executive VincentBarraba, who directed the 1980 census, recently said, &quot;Theultimate indignity was being sued by the city of New York forincompetence and inefficiency.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
