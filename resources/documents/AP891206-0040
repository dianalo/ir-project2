The link enabled NASA scientists to date one of the mostpowerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history.   Ancient Chinese annals tell how the climate was disrupted about3,600 years ago after what scientists now know was the eruption ofSantorini volcano, which destroyed much of the Aegean island ofThera, near what became Greece.   The eruption was dated to 1600 B.C., give or take 30 years, byresearchers headed by astronomer Kevin Pang of the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Pang presented the findings Tuesday during an American GeophysicalUnion meeting.   ``Not only are we able to get a date for this eruption _ ifpeople agree on the same century that's pretty good _ but we nowactually have eyewitness accounts of what happened (to the weatherthousands of miles away in China) after the Thera-Santorinieruption,'' Pang said.   NASA said effects of Santorini's blast were felt around theworld, and Thera's destruction is believed to be the source ofPlato's story of Atlantis, which tells of an island civilizationsubmerged by the sea after being shaken by earthquakes.   ``Recent archaeological studies suggest that `Atlantis' may havebeen Minoan centers on Crete, destroyed by tidal waves from theThera-Santorini eruption,'' Pang said.   U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist Bob Tilling called Pang'sstudy ``kind of neat. He has another line of evidence linkingclimatic effects to that eruption. ... We need to get a better ideaof how often these large eruptions take place and whether there isany pattern to them. That gives us a much better basis to forecastpossible future eruptions.''   Pang said Santorini's eruption packed the punch of ``2 millionHiroshima atomic bombs going off at the same time. Santorini wasroughly 100 times more powerful than Krakatau (Indonesia, 1883).Mount St. Helens is a little bitty volcano compared with this.''   Pang and NASA called the Thera-Santorini explosion the mostpowerful volcano eruption in recorded history. Tilling said he wasunsure of the latest estimates, but ``it is clearly one of thelargest.''   The volcano spewed sunlight-blocking debris and acid aerosols,chilling Earth's climate to cause disturbances noted in historicalaccounts of the reign of King Jie, the last king of the Xiadynasty, which is China's earliest recorded dynasty.   ``At the time of King Jie, the sun was dimmed,'' the annals say.``Three suns appeared (due to ice crystals in the atmosphererefracting the sun's image). ... Winter and summer cameirregularly. ... Frosts formed in the sixth month (July on theChinese calendar). ... The five cereals withered. ... Thereforefamine occurred. ... There was heavy rainfall and communities weredestroyed.''   Cold wet summers also were observed following massive eruptionsof Indonesia's Tambora in 1815, Iceland's Laki in 1783 and anotherIceland volcano in 208 B.C., Pang said.   After finding references to Santorini's climatic effects in theXia dynasty histories, Pang and his colleagues dated thosereferences using Shang Dynasty ``oracle bones'' _ genealogiesinscribed on tortoise shells and ox shoulder blades _ and WesternZhou royal genealogies.   The genealogies previously were dated by linking astronomicalevents to the reigns of certain kings. In one case, Pang found ahistorical account of a day that dawned twice that must have beenApril 21, 899 B.C., when dawn was interrupted by a solar eclipse.   Pang said previous studies used volcano-caused excesses ofsulfuric acid in ice cores from Greenland to estimate Thera eruptedhappened between 1670 B.C. and 1620 B.C., compared with his daterange of 1630 B.C. to 1570 B.C. Stunted growth rings in Irish oaktrees and North American pines put it between 1613 B.C. and 1631B.C.   ``Some date it as late as the 14th century B.C. and some date itas early as the 18th century B.C.,'' he said. ``Now all the methodsare converging on the late 17th century B.C.''   Pang conducted the study with physicist Santosh Srivastava andcomputer scientist Robert Keston of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, andHung-hsiang Chou, an Asian languages professor at the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
