Clark Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ECO </IN><TEXT>   The statistics that have been appearing in recent weeks portray a reasonably robust economy. Yet economists, looking at the same numbers, continue to say that the economy is slowing down.    On Wednesday, the Commerce Department will issue a preliminary report on the real gross national product for the final quarter of 1987. The 52 economists interviewed monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, on the average think the inflation-adjusted GNP, the value of the nation's output of goods and services, rose at an annual rate of 2.1% in the October-December period, a sharp drop from the 4.3% gain in the third quarter. The Blue Chip analysts, moreover, look for growth of only 1.4% in this year's first half.    What's the explanation? It's partly a matter of timing. The Blue Chip analysts accept the general view that consumers are cutting back. The December retail sales numbers released in mid-January supported that assessment. Exports are picking up a lot of the shortage, but the match isn't perfect. The forecasts of a slow first half also are based on a belief that business inventories are larger than businessmen want; in the first half, the reasoning goes, companies will be working off these stocks, resulting in reduced production.    It's a mixed picture, though. Durable goods orders for December, scheduled for release tomorrow, are expected to show a reasonably good increase, after a small decline the previous month. One factor is expected to be an increase in aircraft orders.    Statistics to be released Thursday will provide a further indication of where the consumer really stands. Analysts expect personal income and personal consumption for December to show strong increases, perhaps about 1%. In an analysis, the investment firm of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. says: &quot;Scheduled farm subsidy payments should be responsible for the excess growth in personal income above the 0.6% average monthly gain so far in 1987. On the spending side, rebates on domestic cars and trucks propped up total purchases of consumer goods, and expenditures for services -- particularly utilities -- were probably boosted by cold weather and snowstorms in the Western states.&quot;    M1 money supply continues to worry many economists. In the past two months, M1-composed of currency and checking accounts -- has declined. The trouble began long before that, according to Edward S. Hyman of the investment firm of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. &quot;Over the past year,&quot; he says, &quot;non-borrowed reserves have shown no growth. This lack of reserve growth, in our view, is the key reason for the money slowdown. Since early October, prior to Black Monday, the Fed has drained reserves.&quot;    Ed Campbell, chief economist of Brown Brothers Harriman andamp; Co., says concern about the money supply is a major problem in his generally optimistic forecast. He is expecting the current quarter to be weak, with real growth of only 0.7%, but he expects faster growth later, with the expansion extending at least through 1989. &quot;At the moment,&quot; he says, &quot;that's the end of my world.&quot;    Continued growth, be believes, will depend heavily on the Federal Reserve's pumping more reserves into the economy. Another aid, he figures, may be the fact that velocity, the relationship between monetary growth and economic growth, has begun to increase.    Other optimists argue that the consumer is likely to continue to be a strong contributor to economic growth this year. Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities emphasizes the strong employment reports in November and December; payroll jobs in the two months rose a total of 589,000.    &quot;How do you get a consumer-led recession, with employment gains continuing so strong during the two months after the Oct. 19 crash?&quot; Mr. Yardeni says. &quot;Our consumer optimism index did decline sharply during November from record highs before the crash. But it upticked in December and remains at a very optimistic level.&quot; (The Sindlinger Consumer Confidence Percent also is at a high level, well above the reading of 50 that the Sindlinger firm would consider worrisome.)    ---               The Economy in Numbers         Statistics Released in the Past Week                                                CHANGE                                                (from prior                                     TOTAL      period)    M1 Money Supply    Week to Jan. 11    (in billions)                   $757.8       +.16%    Capacity utilization    Dec. index                        82.1%      +0.1    Consumer price index    Dec.                             345.7%      +0.1%    New Jobless claims    Week ended Jan. 9               355,000     +10.2%    Housing starts    Dec. annual rate    (in thousands)                    1,374     -16.2%    Building permits    Dec. annual rate    (in thousands)                    1,340      -8.8%    Sindlinger Consumer    Confidence Percent    Three-day period    (Jan. 19-20-21)                    64.5      +0.8             Statistics to Be Released This Week    New car sales (Mon.)
