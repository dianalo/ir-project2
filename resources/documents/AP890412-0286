The Ireland-based company's chief operating officer, James M.King, said he is ordering a mix of airplane models manufactured byBoeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Airbus Industrie, theEuropean joint venture aircraft maker.   The planes will include wide-bodied and narrow-bodied planes andengines and will be the largest order ever, he said.   Details of the order and the companies lined up to lease theaircraft will be announced next Tuesday, King said.   The order includes engines supplied by Rolls-Royce PLC, Prattand Whitney, Britain's General Electric Co., and CFMI, a jointventure of General Electric and SNECMA of France.   Analysts said the order is expected to exceed 200 planes andwould be worth almost $20 billion.   Asked about these figures, King said, ``While I cannot confirm aprecise number to you, the suggestion is substantially correct.It's in the region of 200 aircraft.''   He indicated that a figure somewhere between $11 billion and $20billion would be nearer the total value of the order.   The largest previous order was by Delta Air Lines last Septemberfor 225 Boeing and McDonnell Douglas planes worth $10.5 billion.   Tony Ryan, the head of GPA, said the deal would leave thecompany three times larger than its nearest competitors in theaircraft leasing field.   The Engineer magazine reported that Rolls-Royce will supplyengines for 50 Boeing 757s likely to be involved in the order.   British Aerospace will make the wings for the Airbus A330s andA320s which may also be fitted with Rolls-Royce engines, themagazine said. GPA has already ordered 40 A320s.   McDonnell Douglas could also win orders for MD-11 and MD-80aircraft and the former may also carry Rolls-Royce engines, themagazine said.</TEXT></DOC>
