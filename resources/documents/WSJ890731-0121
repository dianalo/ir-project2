In Mr. Shaw's overview, concepts we normally associate with rational discourse -- logic, reason, objectivity -- are being replaced by the &quot;right feeling and good intentions&quot; and a dictatorial skepticism about the validity of knowledge. The war of the book's title thus rages on two fronts: the political and the philosophical. Guilt and shame over the humanities' failure to take proper cognizance of women, minorities and the disenfranchised has created an animus toward traditional aesthetic and historical surveys. As a result, once widely accepted ideas about the origins and intent of art are seen by a new generation of scholars as &quot;yet another hegemonic imposition employed by the powerful to enslave the rest of society.&quot;    The philosophical assault is more subtle, though no less subversive. Borrowing from such French philosophers as Barthes and Derrida, American critics have discovered the specter of indeterminacy haunting the house of intellect. Our neurological makeup and the self-reflexive limits of language make us read and interpret texts in predetermined patterns, so they say. Objectivity is a naive myth, and hierarchies of meaning a political tool. All this makes for heady academic debate, but, Mr. Shaw cautions, when put into pedagogic practice it becomes cause for grave concern.    The avowed purpose of such teachings is to demonstrate that, of the five words in the phrase High Culture of Western Civilization, four are inherently unfair to most of the world's population. Political convictions, of course, cannot be proved wrong, but their application to texts, as Mr. Shaw shows, can contain errors and inconsistencies issuing from ideological dogma.    Mr. Shaw's reconnaissance in the enemy camp is laid out in 11 essays whose titles alone make a depressing statement: &quot;The Dark Age of the Humanities,&quot; &quot;The Demotion of Man,&quot; &quot;The Decline of Criticism.&quot; Each essay documents a set of revisionist tendencies as they affect, among other subjects, Pound's &quot;Cantos,&quot; Melville's &quot;Typee,&quot; scholarly editing, plagiarism and anthropology. What emerges is a view of civilized man as a nasty piece of goods, endowed with fewer noble qualities than are found in primitive societies or sometimes in the animal kingdom. As for the treasures of Western culture, they are, according to one feminist critic, nothing more than &quot;the patrimony of male writers.&quot;    For Mr. Shaw, the danger lies not so much in such opinions, but in the process of intimidation that bars dissent. In the current academic climate, high culture is viewed as a form of social control that must be opposed at every turn. Reparations must be made to neglected artists (female) and unrecognized work (by minorities). To think otherwise is to run the risk of being considered insensitive to these groups. What's a poor academic to do? Apparently, most acquiesce. As Mr. Shaw notes, it is not assaults by Goths and cultural revolutionaries that pose the crucial danger, &quot;but the ways that the guardians of the tradition themselves behave.&quot; In short, institutions of learning crumble from within, not without.    Is Mr. Shaw right? In his interrogation of scholars who wish to be politically correct and intellectually hip, I believe he is right on the mark. It's the intensity of his concern, however, that may prove bothersome. A critic must be allowed his earnestness and probity, yet the essays could do with a flash of wit or humor, if only to put Mr. Shaw firmly on the side of the angels. More importantly, his indignation leads him to a rash statement of his own: &quot;Our predecessors thought and expressed some things in ways that cannot be improved upon.&quot; Surely those committed to the fallacy of tradition could want no weaker line of defense to overrun.    What is most infuriating about these antinomian theorists is their presumption that the rest of us hold to a permanent and implacable set of values. What historical-minded person is unaware that values and beliefs must continually be re-evaluated in light of changing social conditions? Without such changes, art itself would not change.    Being a reasonable man, Mr. Shaw resents the role that reason has been thrust into. Reason is not a weapon the powerful wield over the powerless. If acts undertaken in the name of reason have been clouded by self-interest and prejudice, that does not nullify reason itself. As for art, it is certainly not the best of times and, as Mr. Shaw glumly observes, politically correct art is critically acclaimed art. Yet I cannot help but feel, despite Mr. Shaw's severe and lucid arguments, that the idea of high art will survive the polemics that both defend and deface it, just as civilization will outlast the wars fought in its midst.    ---   Mr. Krystal is a writer and editor living in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
