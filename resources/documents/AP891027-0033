Manclarksaid Thursday about Rino Rappuoli's recent findings.   But Manclark, who runs the laboratory where the Food and DrugAdministration studies pertussis, or whooping cough, said he didn'tthink it could be called a major breakthrough because tests onchildren are months away.   Rappuoli said in a telephone interview from the Sclavo ResearchCenter in Siena, Italy, that he had discovered a non-toxic vaccinethat doesn't appear to cause the side effects sometimes associatedwith the current vaccine, yet it still protects against the disease.   Widespread vaccination keeps whooping cough from affecting manychildren in the United States, but it causes 1 million deaths ayear and affects 60 million infants worldwide.   Most U.S. children are vaccinated before age 3, usually at thesame time they receive vaccines for diphtheria and typhoid.Pertussis is the ``P'' in the DPT shots given to infants.   Although the vaccine is credited with keeping the incidence ofthe disease to around 4,000 cases a year in the United States, somemedical officials link it to cases of brain damage in somechildren. Other medical experts say no evidence exists showing thatthe vaccine is responsible for neurological disorders.   Some lawsuits allege neurological disorders were caused by thevaccine, and some parents have refused to let their children beimmunized.   The current vaccine is made from whole pertussis bacteria cellsthat have been killed. Rappuoli, along with U.S. researchers, hasbeen trying to find a way to eliminate the toxic effects of thevaccine while retaining the portion of the dead bacteria thatcauses the patient to develop immunity to the disease.   Rappuoli, using genetic engineering, altered the bacteria todevelop multiple mutants that he said no longer include the toxicportions but still provided immunity for mice in the study.   ``Such molecules are ideal for the development of new and safervaccines against whooping cough,'' said the research, published intoday's issue of Science, the journal of the American Associationfor the Advancement of Science.   Manclark said the FDA is trying to determine a test site forclinical studies for the new vaccine. Those studies can't takeplace in the United States because the disease is not widespreadenough, he said, adding that Denmark, Germany, Italy, England andThailand are potential sites.</TEXT></DOC>
