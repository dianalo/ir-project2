Manuel Antonio Noriega failed ignominiouslywhen an officer loyal to Noriega locked the plotters inside anarsenal, a newspaper reported today.   Citing unidentified senior administration officials, the ChicagoTribune reported in today's editions that the failure of theallegedly U.S.-backed coup has left the Reagan administration'santi-Noriega plans in chaos.   The newspaper said several anti-Noriega members of the15,000-member Panama Defense Forces went to the Central Americannation's main arsenal in Panama City last month to obtain guns forthe attempt, pretending to be on official military business.   The guard commander at the arsenal, however, locked the plottersinside and reported to his superiors that he thought a coup was inprogress, the newspaper reported.   Swift action by Noriega's supporters put down the conspiracy andresulted in the purge or arrest of nearly three dozen anti-Noriegaofficers during the last several weeks, the Tribune reported.   The newspaper quoted a source identified only as a well-placedmilitary expert as saying the abortive coup demonstrates ``thedepth to which the administration planners have underestimatedNoriega and misunderstood the situation there.''</TEXT></DOC>
