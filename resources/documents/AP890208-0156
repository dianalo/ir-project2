At a news conference, Schifter likened North Korea to a``nightmare state'' where ``the government tries really to turnpeople into automatons.''   ``As far as Cuba is concerned, there is an effort there to try toachieve the same thing in terms of total penetration of the countryby secret police truly spying on every citizen,'' he said.   Schifter acknowledged that other analysts who judge regimes bythe number of government-sponsored killings of political opponentswould be less critical of Cuba.   He conceded that he is unaware of any such killings in Cuba in1988. The country with the largest number of killings in 1988, hesaid, was Sudan, where there was large-scale starvation becausegovernment and opposition forces refused to allow emergency fooddeliveries to refugees in contested areas.   The Cuban diplomatic mission here said in reply to Schifter'scomments that the ``United States has no international mandate and,even less, the moral authority to judge or give opinions about theinternal situation in Cuba.   ``We therefore attribute no importance to the opinions that theState Department may have about our country.''   President Fidel Castro has said that Cuba has the world's mostenviable human rights record because of the gains Cuba has made insuch areas as health and education and in maintaining unemploymentat low levels.   Castro also has said that a vigilant attitude among his peoplemust be maintained because of numerous U.S. threats against Cuba andthe many American-sponsored sabotage and assassination attempts.   The section on North Korea in the human rights report said NorthKorea subjects its people to rigid controls.   The report said the regime establishes security ratings for everyresident that determine access to employment, schools, medicalfacilities and stores as well as admission to the ruling party.   The report added that the government imprisons people ``who failto conform to the dictates of the state and often exiles themtogether with their families to remote villages.''   On Cuba, the report said mass organizations attempt to extendCuban government and Communist Party control over each citizen'sdaily activities at home, work and school.   ``Citizens are exhorted to ensure ideological conformity and toreport deviation,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
