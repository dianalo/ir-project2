The indictment charges that NL and two other companies conspired to increase their prices for completion fluids by decreasing the amount they paid customers for fluids that weren't used. In particular, the indictment charges that between early 1986 and early 1987, the companies discussed reducing the amount they would pay for unused fluids and agreed on a reduction to 80% of the original price from 100%.    Kenneth D. Tanner, a retired vice president of an NL division, also was named in the indictment, along with the two other companies and an executive of one of those companies.    NL said it, Baroid Corp. and Mr. Tanner expect to defend themselves vigorously against the charge. In a transaction last year, the Baroid division was split from NL and became Baroid Corp. NL, a chemicals concern, said Baroid Corp., an oil field services concern, is financially responsible for the claims and its defense.    In 1986 and 1987, Baroid's completion fluids' sales totaled $15.9 million, or about 2% of Baroid's petroleum services revenue, NL said. About 35% of those sales were subsequently repurchased from customers.    NL said the indictment doesn't involve Baroid's drilling muds business, which was the subject of a lengthy Justice Department investigation that NL says is now closed. Drilling muds are used in the drilling of an oil or gas well, while completion fluids are salt solutions that are pumped into a well after the drilling is completed. </TEXT></DOC>
