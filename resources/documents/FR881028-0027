This actionconstitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectivenessof these regulations under those procedures. The new sunset review dateestablished for these regulations is August 1, 1993.John Marshall, Manager, FCIC, (1) has determined that this action is nota major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291 because it will not resultin: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (b) majorincreases in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,State, or local governments, or a geographical region; or (c) significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets; and (2) certifies that thisaction will not increase the federal paperwork burden for individuals,small businesses, and other persons and will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.This action is exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct; therefore, no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.450.This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.See the Notice related to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, published at 48 FR29115, June 24, 1983.This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment, health, and safety. Therefore, neither an EnvironmentalAssessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.FCIC proposes to revise and reissue the Quality Potato Option (7 CFR 422.9)with the following changes:1. The Option has been made continuous. The insured no longer has to submita new application for each crop year. All language regarding annual submissionof the form has been removed.2. Language has been added to indicate that if both this Option and thefrost/freeze Option are in effect that only the Option which results inthe least production to count will be considered. This language is necessaryto prevent the possibility of a separate indemnity for each Option.3. The definition of ``acceptable inspection'' and language designatingwho may make grade determinations has been added. These additions are inresponse to an Office of Inspector General_Audit (OIG) comment which requestedthat any grade determination should be made by someone with proper training.4. Additional minor editorial changes have been made to improve clarity.These changes do not effect the meaning or intent of the provisions.FCIC also proposes to add two new Options to the Potato Crop InsuranceRegulations for the 1989 crop year, as follows:1. The proposed Frost/Freeze Option, (7 CFR 422.10), is a modificationof the frost/freeze chart formerly used in conjunction with the 1986 lossadjustment procedures. This Option may be added to a grower's basic policyat an additional premium.2. The proposed Processing Potato Quality Option (7 CFR 422.11), may alsobe added to a grower's basic policy for an additional premium. This Optionprovides quality adjustment specifically for processing potatoes. Its availabilitywill initially be limited to two counties. The current Quality Potato Optionwill provide quality adjustment for both fresh and processing potatoesin other selected counties. After insuring experience is analyzed, useof this Processing Potato Quality Option may be expanded.FCIC is soliciting public comment on this proposed rule for 30 days followingpublication in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Written comments, data, and opinions on theproposed rule should be sent to Peter F. Cole, Office of the Manager, Room4090, South Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.All written comments received pursuant to this notice will be availablefor public inspection and copying at the above address during regular businesshours, Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 422</ITAG>Crop insurance, Potatoes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rule</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop InsuranceAct, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation hereby proposesto amend the Potato Crop Insurance Regulations (7 CFR Part 422), proposedto be effective for the 1989 and succeeding crop years, in the followinginstances:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 422_POTATO CROP INSURANCE REGULATIONS</ITAG>1.
