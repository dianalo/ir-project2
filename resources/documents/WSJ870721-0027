The offering yesterday, led by Morgan Stanley International, pushed GMAC's Eurodollar straight-debt total this year above $1.1 billion, not including other Euromarket offerings, such as medium-term notes.    The bonds were priced at 55 basis points above U.S. Treasurys. A basis point is 1/100 of a percent.    &quot;GMAC is priced about right,&quot; said an official of another U.S. house. &quot;But with all that other GMAC paper out there, no one is going to get excited about this one.&quot;    A Morgan Stanley official agreed that GMAC is viewed as a heavy Euromarket borrower but noted that the company had put a two-year maturity date on its latest offering, a term currently popular among investors. He also said that &quot;there hasn't been much Eurodollar paper (offered by U.S. companies) this year.&quot;    In secondary markets, fixed-coupon Eurodollar bond prices were marked down 1/8 to 1/4 point on what dealers called a &quot;lack of interest&quot; prompted in part by an easing U.S. Treasury market.    Seasoned Euroyen bonds lost about 1/2 point on the steep decline of Japanese government issues. An official of IBJ International Ltd. said that the weakening of the yen against the U.S. dollar was partly responsible for the decline and that major Japanese institutions had fueled the drop further through significant selling of Japanese government issues. </TEXT></DOC>
