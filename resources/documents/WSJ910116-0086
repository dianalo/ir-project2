Gordon Crovitz</HL><DATE>01/16/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A15</SO><IN>MEDIA, PUBLISHING, BROADCASTING, ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING (MED)</IN><LP>   In the decade since the founding of the Dartmouth Review,many colleges have discovered the intolerance that promptedthe founding of the conservative newspaper and its clones.The pop culture now recognizes the derisive phrase&quot;Politically Correct&quot; to describe those who would banishincorrect ideas from campus. The Review's calls for coursesin Western Civilization and criticism of sacred cows such asracial and ethnic quotas made the newspaper the originalanti-PC.   A politicized campus vs. a political off-campus newspaperis not new, but the confrontation at Dartmouth escalated lastweek to include the arrest of an undergraduate for making ananonymous obscene telephone call to a faculty member whodefends the Review. The arrest is part of a criminalinvestigation into an incident last October when someoneswitched the credo on the newspaper's masthead from a quotefrom Teddy Roosevelt to an anti-Semitic quote from AdolfHitler. When they discovered the switch, Review editorsdestroyed copies of the issue, apologized and said someonehad sabotaged the newspaper by altering the computer filethat included the masthead where the credo appeared.</LP><TEXT>   Despite efforts by Review editors to separate themselvesfrom the Hitler quote, Dartmouth President James Freedmanstoked the understandable outrage over the quote. He spoke ata huge rally on campus against &quot;an act of moral cowardice&quot;and &quot;vicious hatred&quot; by the Review, which he said&quot;consistently attacked blacks because they are blacks, womenbecause they are women, homosexuals because they arehomosexuals and Jews because they are Jews.&quot; In an interviewat the time with the Journal, Mr. Freedman said he hadn'tconsidered the possibility of sabotage by a disaffectedstaffer or outsider.   Review editors, hoping to defend the newspaper from theseattacks and discover who inserted the Hitler quote, asked theHanover, N.H., police to investigate under a law that makescomputer tampering a felony. No charges have been filed forinserting the quote.   Last week, however, police arrested former Review staffmember Pang-Chun Chen on charges of making a harassingtelephone call to Dartmouth English Professor Jeffrey Hart athis home. Mr. Hart is the most vocal faculty member to defendthe Review and blame the Hitler quote on someone set onsabotaging the newspaper. Mr. Hart says that Hanover policetraced the call to a dormitory room and that Mr. Chen, ajunior, admitted making the call.   Police Detective Nicholas Giaccone said the arrest of Mr.Chen was part of his investigation into the Hitler quote, butthat prosecutors have &quot;at the moment&quot; decided there isinsufficient evidence also to charge Mr. Chen with thecomputer tampering. Mr. Chen, who denies inserting the quote,was confronted by Review editors soon after the discovery ofthe quote. Editors say they suspected Mr. Chen because theypreviously reprimanded him for trying to insert obscenitiesinto the newspaper. Other Review staff members tooklie-detector tests denying that they inserted the quote, butMr. Chen refused.   Mr. Chen was one of the Review staffers who resignedimmediately after the Hitler-quote incident. Mr. Hart said herecognized Mr. Chen's voice on the telephone only because hehad just watched a videotape of a Geraldo Rivera televisionshow that featured Mr. Chen and other critics of the Review.   Also last week but before the arrest of Mr. Chen, theAnti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which the Reviewasked to investigate the matter, issued its report. The groupsaid the newspaper was overly provocative andconfrontational. It found an &quot;environment which condoned andeven encouraged a member of the Review&quot; to insert the Hitlerquote. Unlike Mr. Freedman, however, the group did not decidethat the insertion was official Review policy. The report didnot find a particular culprit, but said that &quot;poorproofreading is no defense for failing to discover theoffensive quote prior to its publication&quot; and urged thateditors &quot;exercise more diligent oversight of the productionprocess.&quot;   The chairman of the governor-appointed New Hampshire HumanRights Commission went further. Barry Palmer, a copy editorwith the Union Leader newspaper, initiated his own informalinvestigation into the Review after Mr. Freedman accused thenewspaper of bigotry.   Mr. Palmer says he was surprised by what he found. &quot;I readevery single thing they wrote about teachers. I reviewededitorials and editorial cartoons. And I didn't find anyevidence of bigotry or prejudice.&quot; The Review criticized someadministrators and professors, but Mr. Palmer reported that&quot;after reviewing two years of the publication, I beganwondering what all the fuss was about.&quot;   His conclusions appeared in an article in the UnionLeader. I asked Mr. Palmer why he thought Mr. Freedman wouldaccuse the Review of bias. &quot;This is essentially anideological battle between Dartmouth College and theDartmouth Review,&quot; Mr. Palmer said. &quot;The college istraditionally liberal, and the Review is conservative.&quot; Headded that he thought &quot;there might also be a hypersensitivityto criticism by the president.&quot; As for the Review, Mr. Palmernoted that its editorial position is strongly pro-Israel and&quot;has had Jews, blacks, women and Indians in top positions.&quot;The current editor, Kevin Pritchett, is black, and thepresident is an Asian-American.   It is true that Review staffers have often underminedserious points with overblown satire and generally behavedsophomorically. Mr. Pritchett, a former intern on thisnewspaper's editorial page, wrote in the Review that he hasused his tenure as editor to tone down the newspaper &quot;to aplace where it no longer had to shock to get its pointacross.&quot; He told readers he was trying to &quot;use the scalpelinstead of the cudgel&quot; to move the newspaper &quot;out of theopposition into the mainstream.&quot; One article he cited praisedDartmouth's requirement of a course in a non-Westerncivilization, while urging that Western Civ also be required.   Anyone who worries how long academic freedom can survivewhen the police settle campus disputes might wonder why theDartmouth administration fanned flames after the Hitlerquote. Especially because this is not the first time whatshould be a private matter in a college was settled in court.In 1988, a New Hampshire judge forced Mr. Freedman, a formerlaw professor, to reinstate several Review students who'dbeen suspended for &quot;vexatious oral exchange&quot; with a facultymember.   With a continuing criminal investigation and twoindependent reports on the incident, there are serious doubtsabout Mr. Freedman's claim that the Hitler quote representsReview policy. Continuing smears of the newspaper as racistand anti-Semitic signal that the PC movement remains aliveand well at Dartmouth. It also looks, though, as if the PCerswill have to find another way to close down their best-knowncritic.</TEXT></DOC>
