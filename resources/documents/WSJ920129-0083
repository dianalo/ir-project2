It's no coincidencethat Clarence Thomas found a way to address each one in thefirst four opinions he's written as a Supreme Court justice.Call it activist judicial restraint.   Justice Thomas's first majority opinion for the court hasbeen noted for its conciseness -- 11 pages, no footnotes, nodissents -- and for appearing only a few weeks after hejoined the court. The more important feature of Molzof v.U.S. is how Justice Thomas hinted at a new argument lawyerscan use to say that at least some punitive damages areunconstitutional.</LP><TEXT>   Ironically, this came in a decision that upheld a lawsuitfor damages that went beyond compensatory damages. The widowof a patient who died in a Veteran's Administration hospitalbecause of negligence included a claim for future medicalexpenses and &quot;loss of life&quot; in her lawsuit under the FederalTort Claims Act. The U.S. defended the lawsuit by arguingthat it should be dismissed because the law prohibits anyassessment of punitive damages against the government.   Justice Thomas let the case go forward by noting thatpunitive damages is &quot;a legal term of art that has a widelyaccepted common-law meaning,&quot; which he defined as damages&quot;for torts committed with fraud, actual malice, violence oroppression.&quot; The claim here was only for negligence, and notfor &quot;intentional or egregious misconduct,&quot; so it could bebrought under the Federal Tort Claims Act.   The clear corollary of Justice Thomas's definition ofpunitive damages is that the common law doesn't let juriesaward punitive damages unless the defendant acted with somecombination of fraud, bad intent and egregious misbehavior.Yet in recent years many state judges have instead toldjurors that they could award punitive damages inrun-of-the-mill negligence cases.   Justice Thomas thus opened a new constitutional challengeto punitive damages based on the lack of evil intent by thedefendant. This line of attack on punitive damages hashistorical support. Until very recently, punitive damageswere reserved largely for intentional torts such as assault.Other recent opinions by the court also say that somepunitive damages might be so arbitrary and unpredictable thatthey violate the Due Process Clause.   Justice Thomas also wrote the 6-3 opinion this week in acase widely reported as a loss for labor unions. It was, butmore importantly Lechmere v. NLRB was a victory for privateproperty -- perhaps an indication of more Supreme Courtvictories for property rights in several other cases thejustices will decide this term.   Here, a union campaign to organize a store's workersincluded putting leaflets on the windshields of workers' carsparked in a shopping center lot, which the store owned.Several federal appeals courts have ruled that unions couldgo onto private property to organize workers, especially ontosuch quasi-public land as shopping malls. Justice Thomas saidthat nothing in the labor laws justified this intrusion.   Unions need to be able to communicate with potentialmembers, but he said that &quot;nonemployee organizers cannotclaim even a limited right of access to a nonconsentingemployer's property&quot; except under extraordinary conditions.He rejected a judicial balancing test that in other casesoften sacrificed the employer's property rights. Unionorganizers can trespass only where access to workers isotherwise &quot;infeasible.&quot; He gave as examples logging camps andmountain resort hotels.   In two other cases, Justice Thomas tweaked his newcolleagues for failing to adhere closely enough to theConstitution. He agreed with the result in White v. Illinois-- that a defendant accused of sexual assault on a childcan't invoke the Confrontation Clause to block hearsayevidence against him -- but cited several precedents that hesaid ignored the strict language of the Constitution. In aconcurring opinion joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, JusticeThomas noted that this clause guarantees only that adefendant can confront &quot;witnesses against him,&quot; and saysnothing about the technical rules of hearsay.   &quot;This court's cases have complicated and confused therelationship between the constitutional right ofconfrontation and the hearsay rules of evidence,&quot; JusticeThomas wrote, concluding that this line of reasoning isfatally flawed. &quot;I respectfully suggest that in anappropriate case we reconsider how the phrase `witnessagainst' in the Confrontation Clause pertains to theadmission of hearsay.&quot;   Justice Thomas also wrote a dissent that reminded theother justices that they too are subject to separation ofpowers, including the limit on judicial power from the narrowcategory of cases where the Supreme Court has originaljurisdiction to hear disputes. The majority opinion said thatWyoming v. Oklahoma was one of the rare cases where theSupreme Court has original jurisdiction under theConstitution because the parties in the lawsuit are states.Justice Thomas wrote a dissent, also signed by Chief JusticeWilliam Rehnquist and Justice Scalia, arguing that thejustices shouldn't decide the case because this was notreally a case between states.   Instead, the underlying issue was that Oklahoma passed alaw requiring utilities in the state to use 10%Oklahoma-mined coal. This made it harder for Wyoming miningcompanies to sell in Oklahoma, where they had provided nearlyall the coal. Wyoming then sued under the Commerce Clausearguing that the Oklahoma law reduced its state revenues bycutting the receipts on the severance tax it places on coalextracted from Wyoming. Justice Thomas's dissent said thatthis remote harm does not give Wyoming standing to sue, sothe case shouldn't be in the Supreme Court.   &quot;Wyoming has advanced no reason why the affected miningcompanies (hardly bashful litigants) did not or could notthemselves&quot; bring the lawsuit, he wrote. Justice Thomas wouldhave refused to hear the case, saving the Supreme Courtdocket for cases the justices must hear.   Judicial restraint means that judges or even justicessometimes must admit that they don't have the authority toresolve a dispute. This point is related to the closeattention Justice Thomas paid as a federal appeals judge towhen a controversy is moot and when it's ripe for judicialresolution.   It's worth noting that in the 25 opinions the SupremeCourt has issued so far, Justice Thomas has voted withJustice Scalia more than with any other justice. Indeed, theydiffered only in one case -- where Justice Scalia wrote aseparate concurring opinion of three sentences in a decisionon how appeals must be filed.   Justice Thomas already has done more than solidify theintellectual conservative wing of the court. It also seemslikely that his lifelong career on the Supreme Court will bea constant reminder to his critics of why they went to suchlengths to try to block his nomination.</TEXT></DOC>
