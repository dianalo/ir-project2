The materials have been sealed since 1981 under two sweeping protective orders.    Barring an appeal to the Supreme Court, the ruling could prolong publicity about the herbicide-exposure to which has been associated with a wide range of disabilities among Vietnam veterans -- as attorneys and reporters pour through the material. Only some of the documents were made public during the Agent Orange case, which the companies settled for $180 million in 1984.    The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in yesterday's ruling, said that the materials had been sealed only temporarily and that the chemical companies now must show &quot;good cause&quot; for the continued sealing of any individual documents. The companies had argued that forcing them to go through the material would be too costly and would violate terms of the 1984 settlement.    &quot;We're disappointed in the decision but respect their opinion,&quot; said Leonard L. Rivkin, attorney for Dow Chemical Co., who argued the appeal for the chemical companies. He said all documents &quot;of any interest&quot; already have been made public.    The other companies listed in court documents in the Agent Orange case, brought by alleged victims of the herbicide used in the Vietnam War, include Diamond Shamrock Corp., Hercules Inc., Monsanto Co., Uniroyal Inc., T H Agriculture andamp; Nutrition Co. and Thompson Chemicals Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
