Ironically, Mr. Quayle made his remarks justafter the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationdelayed for at least a week the scheduled launch of theshuttle Atlantis because of a computer problem.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Quayle didn't give a reason for signaling an end tothe shuttle era, but the vehicle is widely seen as too balky,too complex and too risky to serve as the nation's main spacelauncher. The vice president left open the possibility thatthe U.S. might buy another orbiter in case one is destroyedduring flight. But he clearly indicated that the U.S. had noplans to expand the shuttle fleet beyond four orbiters.   Rockwell International Corp., which makes the spaceshuttle, delivered the fourth orbiter, the Endeavour, to NASAin April. The new shuttle, which is to make its first flightin May 1992, will replace the Challenger orbiter, which blewup in January 1986.   &quot;We believe that a vigorous space effort involving abalanced program of manned and unmanned missions is in ourcountry's best interest,&quot; Sam F. Iacobellis, Rockwell's chiefoperating officer, said yesterday in response to the vicepresident's statement. Mr. Iacobellis added that &quot;regardlessof how the U.S. decides to pursue its space goals, Rockwellwill remain a major player.&quot; The company has a contract tomodify and upgrade the shuttle Columbia, and continues toprovide support services to NASA.   NASA has long been trying to expand the shuttle fleet andthis year unsuccessfully lobbied the White House budgetoffice to authorize a fifth orbiter. But NASA AdministratorRichard Truly said he was pleased with the Bushadministration's new shuttle policy because it &quot;doesn't slamthe door&quot; on the purchase of new orbiters, at least asreplacements.   Under a launch policy released yesterday in connectionwith the vice president's speech, the administration said itwould continue to purchase shuttle spare parts. Theadministration also said NASA would continue operating theshuttles &quot;conservatively&quot; as part of an effort to increasethe operational life of the shuttle fleet. The administrationexpects to use shuttles for as long as 20 more years.   At the same time, though, the policy envisions building anew set of launchers that would ultimately replace theshuttle. The launch system is expected to cost between $10billion and $12 billion to develop, Mr. Truly said, and couldbe ready as early as 1999. It would initially be designed asan unmanned rocket that could carry heavier loads than theshuttle, but it could evolve into a manned launcher as well.   But the proposal for the new launch system, which was themain recommendation of a White House space panel in December,has so far faced a lukewarm reception in Congress. Theadministration requested $350 million for the new launcher inthe next fiscal year, but is likely to get only a smallfraction of that amount.   Separately, a General Accounting Office report expected tobe released today criticized NASA and the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration for problems in developing anew generation of weather satellites. The GAO blamed &quot;designcomplexity, inadequate management of the program by NASA andNOAA and poor contractor performance&quot; for the GOES-Nextsatellite program's running $500 million over budget andthree years behind schedule.   The U.S. has only one operational satellite to providedata on hurricanes and other severe storms. That satellite,called GOES-7, is expected to begin to drift out of orbit inJune 1992. The GOES-Next won't be ready for launch untilOctober 1992, if then, the GAO report said.   Loral Corp., which bought Ford Aerospace Corp., isbuilding the GOES satellite, which stands for GeostationaryOperational Environmental Satellite. ITT Corp. is buildingthe satellite's instruments.   A Loral spokeswoman declined comment on the GAO report.   Rep. James Scheuer (D., N.Y.), chairman of a House sciencesubcommittee that plans a hearing on the GOES problems today,said the U.S. must start negotiating with Europe and Japan touse their weather satellites to help fill an expected gap inU.S. coverage.</TEXT></DOC>
