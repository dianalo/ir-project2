In August, the U.S. Claim Court ruled Manville failed to prove the government breached its wartime contracts with the company. Manville, in seeking about $1 million, had argued the government didn't comply with proper safety standards in using asbestos, a mineral, in World War II ship construction.    The mineral causes cancers and deadly lung diseases that often don't show up for years.    The Denver-based building and forest products concern sought protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code five years ago after being flooded with lawsuits claiming death, disease or property damage from exposure to Manville products containing asbestos.    &quot;We believe there are significant errors of fact and law that justify an appeal and warrant reversal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,&quot; said Robert Batson, Manville's senior litigation counsel. </TEXT></DOC>
