The House is scheduled to begin debate Tuesday and voteWednesday on an insider trading bill sponsored by Reps. Edward J.Markey, D-Mass., and John D. Dingell, D-Mich. It would double themaximum jail term for criminal convictions on insider tradingcharges and increase fines fivefold for firms and tenfold forindividuals.   Markey, at a meeting Friday of his Energy and Commercesubcommittee on finance, predicted that the filing of governmentcharges earlier in the week against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.would prod Congress to quick action.   Drexel and the chief of its junk bond unit, Michael Milken, arenamed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a wide-rangingcivil complaint alleging insider trading, fraud and otherviolations.   ``These allegations should propel insider trading reforms ...into law by the end of this year,'' Markey said. ``We will notpermit the rich and greedy to treat our nation's financial marketsas little toys to be played with and manipulated for privateamusement and profiteering.''   The legislation passed the Energy and Commerce Committee a monthago. Many in the Senate also favor it, but the bill faces anuncertain future there.   Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., in atelephone interview Friday, raised the possibility of linkingSenate passage of the insider trading legislation to House actionon a Senate-passed bill giving banks new powers to underwritesecurities.   Proxmire said he is conferring with other senators on hiscommittee and has made no decision about linkage, but added, ``Wewant to hold all our options open.''   The banking bill, which passed the Senate on a 94-2 vote morethan five months ago, would be the most comprehensive restructuringof the financial system since the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Actbarred banks from most securities business.   A bill much less favorable to banks than the Senate measurepassed the House Banking Committee earlier this summer on a 31-20vote and must go through Dingell's committee before it gets to theHouse floor.   Dingell, in an interview broadcast Sunday by ABC News ``BusinessWorld,'' predicted insider trading legislation would pass Congressthis year, but said of the banking bill, ``That's going to takelonger if I have any say.''   However, Proxmire argues that linking the banking bill to theinsider trading measure would enhance the chances of both passingbefore Congress adjourns early next month.   ``I think they should help each other,'' he said. ``There's noreason why a (banking) bill with strong support in the Senate andin the House Banking Committee will not bring strong support toinsider trading legislation.''   The House insider trading bill would:   _Increase the maximum jail term for criminal insider tradingfrom five years to 10 years.   _Boost the maximum criminal fine from $500,000 for firms and$100,000 for individuals to $2.5 million for firms and $1 millionfor individuals.   _Make it possible for securities firms to be fined forviolations by their employees in cases where the firm ``knew orrecklessly disregarded'' the facts.   _Authorize the SEC to pay a bounty to whistle-blowers who giveinformation to authorities.   _Give investors who lost money by trading in the same securitiesas insider traders the right to sue inside traders for damages.   _Grant new powers to the SEC to cooperate with foreign countriesinvestigating insider trading cases that involve U.S. citizens. Theidea is to encourage other nations to grant similar reciprocal aidto the SEC.   Late in July, the Senate Banking Committee passed much narrowerinsider trading legislation including only the provisions oninternational cooperation.   Last September, as part of a corporate takeover bill that failedto get through the full Senate, the banking committee approvedincreased fines and jail terms for insider trading.</TEXT></DOC>
