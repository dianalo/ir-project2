Meanwhile, Argentina's new $1.95 billion bank loan is almost complete, and is scheduled to be signed in mid-August, said William R. Rhodes, the Citicorp executive who heads the committee of Argentina's main creditor banks.    There were other developments in the international debt field. Bolivia announced an innovative scheme to buy back some of its debt to foreign banks. Another portion of Mexico's $7.7 billion bank loan signed earlier this year went unused because the country's exports are doing well. And creditor banks will meet this week to decide how to raise $1.06 billion in new loans for Colombia.    The IMF seal of approval for Argentina took longer to obtain than usual.    The IMF usually considers a bank loan for a debt-troubled country to have reached a so-called critical mass, and releases its own loan to the debtor, soon after 90% of the bank loan is gathered. According to Mr. Rhodes, more than two-thirds of Argentina's 300 foreign creditor banks have contributed a total of about 99%, or $1.93 billion, of the $1.95 billion loan.    But the country's economy recently has strayed from previously agreed fiscal and inflation guidelines and new targets had to be set with the IMF, Mario Brodersohn, Argentina's Treasury Secretary, said in an interview Friday. He declined to say what the new targets are.    Argentina will draw the $661 million IMF loan Wednesday, and will use most of the money to repay a $500 million loan extended in February by the U.S., Japan, Canada and several Western European nations. The remainder will be used to help finance Argentina's balance-of-payments deficit. The IMF loan was meant to help compensate Argentina for the fall in prices in 1986 for its agricultural exports, the agency said.    The other IMF loan of $1.4 billion and the new bank loan will be used to help finance the balance-of-payments deficit, increase foreign-exchange reserves and make interest payments.    If Argentina's new bank loan is signed in mid-August, as bankers now expect, much of it will be disbursed by the end of that month. Mr. Rhodes, a Citicorp group chief executive, is optimistic about the prospects for drawing in still more creditor banks before the signing.    He expects many smaller banks will be persuaded to join the loan by an agreement last week to adjust the terms. Under this adjustment, creditor banks that are owed $30 million or less by Argentina may swap that debt for so-called exit bonds, provided they accept the bonds for all their Argentine debt. These tradable bonds, which have a 25-year maturity and a 4% annual interest rate, allow smaller lenders to sell their Argentine loans.    Amendments that give creditor banks the option to sell their debt seem to be the fashion. Bank of America, the banking unit of BankAmerica Corp., said Friday that Bolivia and its main commercial-bank creditors had signed an amendment to that country's 1981 debt restructuring that allows the country to offer to buy back debt at substantial discounts over a four-month period. The funds for these purchases will be provided by unnamed wealthier nations through an IMF trusteeship.    At the end of the four months, all banks that have agreed to sell their debt back to Bolivia will be paid at the highest price Bolivia has offered any bank during that period.    Meanwhile, commercial banks are finding that their commitments to lend to Mexico are shrinking a little. Late last week a deadline passed for use of the third portion -- about $340 million -- of a $1.2 billion export contingency loan for Mexico. This $1.2 billion was part of a $7.7 billion bank loan signed by banks earlier this year.    These funds are lent to Mexico if its exports slump. That hasn't happened, and so as time passes slices of this loan expire without being used. Another, separate $500 million contingency loan to help Mexico if oil prices decline also hasn't been utilized, so bankers now estimate that Mexico's $7.7 billion loan has shrunk by more than $1 billion.    But there are continuing Latin American calls on banks' resources. Colombia's main international banks will meet this week to decide how to raise $1.06 billion in new loans for that country, the only large Latin American country never to reschedule its bank debt. This money will be used to meet the country's financing needs through 1987 and 1988, during which time Colombia will pay back substantial amounts of debt principal to foreign banks. </TEXT></DOC>
