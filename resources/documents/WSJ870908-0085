Manguno.    ---   ON STUDENT AND LABOR VIOLENCE: The president said that he had anticipated some political upheaval after his July 1 announcement that Koreans would be permitted direct elections to choose their next president but added that &quot;some of the violent stuff was more than I expected.&quot;    He said he intends to stick with his pledge to hold free elections; he warned that South Korea's need for constant vigilance against the threat from North Korea means that Korean politics &quot;shouldn't be too divisive.&quot; Noting that 1.5 million Korean soldiers face each other &quot;at shooting distance,&quot; he said: &quot;You have a very repressive society in North Korea, and any disturbance in South Korea will embolden them. We don't want that kind of quiet society but we don't want too divisive a society. We want political institutions to be stable. We want constancy of expectations.&quot;    President Chun added, &quot;I'm not saying everything is under control. Am I concerned? Yes. Alarmed? No.&quot;    ---   ON THE MOTIVES OF DEMONSTRATORS: &quot;Those who resort to shouting or throwing fire bombs or arson or destructive violence want to intimidate the majority of Koreans,&quot; the president said. &quot;I say the law will not allow the situation to become so bad that the constitution is faced with danger. Every responsible government is sworn to defend the constitution against foreign and domestic enemies. When the law takes a stern measure against violence, the people will support the law.&quot;    The best way to deal with labor unrest, he said, is to let labor and management talk. &quot;That formula is working,&quot; he said. &quot;But when a labor dispute becomes large-scale political riot, the law will have to stop that.&quot;    ---   ON USING THE MILITARY TO QUELL VIOLENCE: The president pointedly drew a distinction between his right to use the military and his intention to do so.    &quot;There is a fundamental difference between a military moving into a crisis situation -- earthquake or something -- by order of an elected president who is commander in chief . . . to deal with an emergency and a situation where the military moves in to overthrow a duly elected government. Anytime the military moves in, is that a military intervention in politics? No.&quot;    President Chun noted that in the past, American presidents have called in the National Guard or the Marines to maintain order, seeming to indicate his use of the military was comparable.    &quot;I have never used the military force to deal with civil disobedience,&quot; he said. &quot;You have this impression Korea is repressive because of the way we handled things before I was elected.&quot; (After he seized control in a coup but before his election as president, Mr. Chun used the military to quell student disturbances supported by ordinary Koreans at Kwangju in 1980, a bitter incident in the memory of many Koreans.)    ---   ON A PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER: President Chun insisted he is confident he will step down Feb. 25 and turn over the government to whoever is freely elected -- even if it is Kim Dae Jung, the man he sentenced to death and then spared at U.S. insistence -- on charges of fomenting the disturbances in Kwangju.    &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;stepping down is the way to ensure continued progress in this country. There will be a peaceful transfer of power,&quot; he added. &quot;You can be sure of that. Even if there are some difficulties, I will never use that as a pretext.&quot;    ---   ON A NEAR-MILITARY CRACKDOWN IN JUNE: Asked about news reports that his government came close to a military crackdown in June when anti-government demonstrators filled the streets day after day, President Chun insisted he never contemplated such a move but was urged to do so by some town leaders. &quot;Yes, when in some towns the situation became so threatening and dangerous some mayors and local governments recommended considering imposing a garrison state,&quot; he said. &quot;It was not seriously considered by me,&quot; he added. &quot;I pledge my best efforts to obviate the necessity to have to consider such extraordinary measures. I will do the best I can.&quot;    ---   ON KOREAN DEMOCRACY: &quot;We will never be like Americans,&quot; he said. But the president didn't describe in detail what he does mean by democracy. Having been president of Korea, he said, he is aware of the &quot;awesome power&quot; the president has and added, &quot;So I am for checks on presidential power. People will decide their own forms of government. I have confidence in the people of my country.&quot;    ---   ON HIS LEGACY: Noting that he took power in Korea at a time of political, social and economic chaos, Mr. Chun proudly added that today Korea is the world's 18th-largest economy and its 12th-largest trading nation. &quot;In 1980 we had a huge debt,&quot; he said. &quot;Our gross national product was $60 billion. In seven years, that GNP has doubled. Not many countries double GNP in seven years. I am proud of the people I am privileged to serve.&quot;    ---   ON THE KEY TASKS FOR HIS SUCCESSOR: The most important task, he answered in writing, after the peaceful transfer of power in February, is the successful staging of the 1988 Olympics. &quot;The success of the Seoul Olympics will enhance the self-confidence and national pride of the Korean people and elevate the international position of the republic,&quot; he said.    ---   ON RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA: President Chun, in writing, said he doesn't believe that more rational and moderate tendencies emerging in other Communist countries such as China and the Soviet Union will affect North Korean policies. But he predicted that by the early 1990s, the north would become aware of the enormous gaps between it and the south. &quot;It will also take note of changes in the situation enveloping the Korean peninsula due to an increasing international recognition of the rising power of the Republic of South Korea. Pyongyang will, then, have to try its hand at a gradual open-door policy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
