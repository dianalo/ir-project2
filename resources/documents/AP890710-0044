Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir bowed tohard-liners within his Likud bloc and agreed to place conditions onthe planned elections of Palestinian representatives to negotiatewith Israel.   The Palestine Liberation Organization reportedly had beenconsidering tentative approval of the Israeli plan for elections inthe Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Times said.   Before its conditional approval, the PLO wanted the plan toinclude a role for itself. But that was rejected last week by Shamir.   Arafat said the United States shared much of the blame forIsrael's new conditions. And he hinted at ending PLO-U.S.discussions, saying they had accomplished little since they startedlate last year.   The new Israeli conditions for elections include that thePalestinian uprising would cease first; that residents of mostlyArab east Jerusalem would not take part in elections; that Jewishsettlements will continue in the West Bank and Gaza; and that Israelwould never agree to give up territory.   The U.S. agreed to begin a dialogue with the PLO after Arafatrenounced terrorism.   But the Times said Arafat refused to comment on the bus crash inIsrael last week in which 14 people died after a Palestinian grabbedthe steering wheel and forced the bus to plunge down a ravine.   He charged that armed Jewish settlers and vigilantes have joinedthe Israeli army in trying to quash the Palestinian uprising.   ``We have not so far given any orders to use weapons, but I havesaid many times before that patience has a limit in the face ofcrimes committed by settlers and the army against our people,''Arafat said.</TEXT></DOC>
