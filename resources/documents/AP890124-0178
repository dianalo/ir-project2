Mobbed by reporters and camera crews, a smiling Gotti emergedfrom the courthouse about 1:30 p.m. and climbed into the back of awaiting Lincoln. Earlier, the alleged leader of the Gambino crimeorganization pleaded innocent to charges he had orchestrated theshooting of a carpenter's union official.   At a morning news conference Manhattan District Attorney RobertMorgenthau released a grand jury indictment charging that Gotti andtwo associates had conspired to order the revenge shooting of theunion leader, who allegedly had a Manhattan restaurant vandalizedfor using non-union carpenters.   ``It was the specific goal and intention of the conspiracy topunish John F. O'Connor, and thereby reaffirm the authority of theGambino crime family over all others who might challenge it,''according to the indictment, which charges Gotti and two associateswith conspiracy and first-degree assault.   O'Connor, vice president and business manager of Local 608 of theUnited Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, survived the May 1986attack, in which he was shot four times.   O'Connor apparently did not know that the restaurant, Bankers andBrokers, was managed by an alleged Gambino family associate, PhillipModica, law enforcement officials said.   At the bail hearing, Assistant District Attorney MichaelCherkasky asked acting state Supreme Court Justice George Roberts tohold Gotti and Anthony (Tony Lee) Guerrieri without bail, sayingthey would likely flee if released.   Bruce Cutler, Gotti's lawyer, said his client had strong roots inNew York and would not flee. ``He's not going no place. He has neverrun away from a problem,'' said Cutler.   Roberts set Gotti's bail at $100,000, and about an hour later the48-year-old Gotti was back on the streets.   Guerrieri, 60, who also pleaded innocent, was freed on $50,000bail. The judge ordered the two to return to court on Monday.   The third man named in the indictment, Angelo Ruggiero, whom theFBI identified as a captain in the Gambino family, remained at a NewYork hospital where he is undergoing treatment. He was arrested atthe hospital on Monday and will be arraigned later, Morgenthau said.   Dozens of police officers, district attorney's detectives, FBIagents and investigators from the state Organized Crime Task Forcedescended on the Little Italy section of lower Manhattan Mondayafternoon to arrest Gotti.   Morgenthau said investigators learned through electronicsurveillance that a contract to kill O'Connor had been given by theGambino group to the leader of the Westies, a crime gang thatoperated on Manhattan's West Side.   Several members of the Westies were named as co-conspirators inthe indictment but were not charged.   At the news conference, Morgenthau insisted that his office hadnot been slow in indicting Gotti, saying: ``When we had all of theevidence that we needed, we proceeded very fast.''   He would not say what the new evidence was.</TEXT></DOC>
