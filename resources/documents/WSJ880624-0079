In a complaint filed in federal court in Hartford, Conn., the SEC alleges that Mr. Russolillo, acting on information supplied by Robert DiGennaro, the former chairman of Suffield Financial Corp., bought stock in Portland, Maine-based Coastal Bancorp prior to the 1986 announcement of Suffield's merger with Coastal.    The SEC said Mr. Russolillo, a plastic surgeon, consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to issuance of an order enjoining him from future violations and directing him to pay the disgorgement and penalty in the amounts sought.    Mr. DiGennaro was convicted of insider trading earlier this month. Mr. Russolillo, who testified in the trial of Mr. DiGennaro, had previously pleaded guilty to one count of insider trading related to his purchases of Coastal stock. </TEXT></DOC>
