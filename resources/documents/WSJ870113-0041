It may come as some surprise, then, to learn that portfolio insurance is really so simple that individual investors not only can understand it, but could also design their own insurance strategies and implement them using mutual funds.    Professional mumbo jumbo aside, portfolio insurance is nothing more than a graduated stop-loss strategy that sells stocks as the market declines and buys as it rallies. It isn't really insurance; the idea is to limit losses while still allowing investors to participate in the market's gains.    &quot;It's just reinventing the wheel, just the same old stop-loss approach, which in itself is a revelation to most people,&quot; says Joseph Grundfest, a Securities and Exchange Commission member.    Using a no-load mutual fund group that allows unlimited switching privileges &quot;could make this practical and affordable for an individual,&quot; says Michael Granito, a managing director of J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. Otherwise, the transaction costs would be prohibitive.    But there is a cost to portfolio insurance, and it can be substantial. Because the tactic doesn't anticipate but only reacts to market moves, investors are always in the position of buying a little high and selling a little low. In a very jumpy market, the incremental losses caused by this &quot;whipsaw effect&quot; could sharply depress results even if stocks ended with a gain.    To understand how the strategy works, investors should think of a portfolio as containing a &quot;risky&quot; asset, such as an equity fund, and a &quot;safe&quot; asset, such as a money market fund. The basic approach is to shelter the investment in the safe asset when stocks decline and expose them to more risk as stocks rise. The portfolio-insurance trading plan will determine the &quot;hedge ratio&quot; -- the portion of funds that should be in each asset at any given time to assure that the value of the total portfolio never falls below the minimum &quot;insured&quot; level, or floor.    The two key strategic choices for investors in designing a trading plan are the level of the floor and over what period of time they want the insurance to work. The higher the floor and the shorter the time span, the more conservative the strategy and the more it will cost.    Robert Ferguson, a vice president at Leland, O'Brien andamp; Rubenstein, a Los Angeles-based investment-advisory firm that sells portfolio insurance to institutions, is using a three-year, no-loss trading plan with different Vanguard Group and Value Line Inc. mutual funds. By &quot;no loss,&quot; he means that in the worse case his portfolio would be worth as much at the end of three years as it is at the beginning.    Thus, even if stocks drop so that the value of the total portfolio is down 10%-15% in the first year, Mr. Ferguson says, the value would be back to its starting level at the end of the third year. That's because the decline would cause him to switch his portfolio into money-market assets, which would earn enough in the remaining time to make up the loss.    The basic approach Mr. Ferguson uses works something like this: He starts with a 90%-10% mix of stocks to cash; when stock prices rise or fall 4% against Treasury bills, he alters the mix by 12%. If stocks went up 4%, he'd cap out at 100% invested; if they fell 4%, he'd lower his exposure from 90% to 78%, and so on.    &quot;It's a simple rule like that,&quot; he says. &quot;You take a starting mix, a trade barrier such as a 4% move, and set an amount to be moved from one asset to the other each time that barrier is crossed.&quot;    Fischer Black, a Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. partner who is a pioneer in portfolio-insurance theory, proposes an even simpler approach. &quot;The version I like for individuals involves starting 100% invested, with an 80% floor,&quot; he says. &quot;All you do is set trading points to sell half your stocks when the market declines half way to your floor; sell half of what's left in stocks when the value of the portfolio drops another quarter of the way to the floor; again, half of what's left when it's one-eighth of the way from the floor, and so on,&quot; he explains. &quot;It's like a rabbit constantly jumping half way to its hole -- mathematically, it will never get there.&quot;    If an investor wants a higher floor of, say, 90%, Mr. Black recommends starting with 50% already invested in the safe asset and using the same 80%-floor trading plan with the 50% that's in stocks. &quot;An individual should never run a program like this with a floor higher than 80%; otherwise, if the market flips around, he'd stand to lose a lot on volatility,&quot; he cautions.    But nobody can eliminate the insidious effect of volatility. Consider what would happen under Mr. Black's strategy to a $100,000 portfolio if the market dropped 10%, then returned to its initial level.    At the low point, when the value of the portfolio fell to $90,000, the strategy would call for the investor to sell half the stocks -- leaving $45,000 in money market funds and $45,000 in stocks. When stocks then rose 10%, the equity portion would be worth $49,500. The strategy would then call for shifting the $45,000 of money-market assets back into stocks. But the total portfolio would be worth only $94,500 -- a loss of 5.5% that wouldn't have been incurred if the investor had simply done nothing.    If the situation kept repeating itself, the investor would give up progressively more until virtually all of the portfolio was sheltered in the safe asset. The investor would then risk paying a very heavy cost in lost opportunity if the market rallied.    Even under normal conditions, volatility will nibble away at an investor's return.    For those put off by the complexities of these strategies, several mutual funds that intend to use portfolio insurance are currently in registration with the SEC. Mr. Ferguson predicts that fund groups will eventually develop customized automatic-switching services that will accomplish these same ends. </TEXT></DOC>
