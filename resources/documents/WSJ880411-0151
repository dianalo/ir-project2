The 18-page study was prepared by Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, a consulting concern in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., for the Chamber of Mines, a trade group that represents some 97 South African mining concerns.    The report is considered significant because most economic analyses have focused either on how effective sanctions have been at reforming South Africa's segregationist government, or on the impact they have had on the country's black population.    This study, by contrast, examines the impact that sanctions have had on those nations that set up the trade barriers. The U.S., which shipped 79.5 million tons of coal abroad in 1987, is the world's second-largest coal exporter. Australia is No. 1.    &quot;Not merely are sanctions hurting the very people they're supposed to help -- blacks -- but it's also impeding people here,&quot; contended John Chettle, a Washington attorney who represents the Chamber of Mines.    The U.S. imposed sanctions limiting a variety of South African export products in 1986. Other Western countries, including Canada, Denmark and France, either followed suit or had previously put sanctions in place.    The study said that South Africa has managed to work around such hurdles. Fearful that they could lose 20% of their 45 million-ton-a-year exporting business, South African coal producers began to slash prices in the hope of attracting new foreign markets and maintaining old ones.    And coal consumers -- especially in the Pacific Rim -- responded quickly, turning to South Africa to take advantage of the rock-bottom prices. Or, in some cases, they put pressure on other exporting nations, forcing prices lower across the globe.    From the time the first embargo against South Africa took effect in 1985, a ton of steam coal on the world market was $48.21. Today, the same ton can be purchased for about $41.99.    &quot;There is evidence that coal importers played South African exporters against Australian, United States or Canadian suppliers,&quot; the Wharton study said, &quot;arguing that they (coal importers) had to have additional price concessions to compensate for pressures exerted on them by anti-apartheid activists within their own borders and by their allies.&quot;    For the U.S., already a high-priced producer of coal because of environmental regulations and relatively high labor costs, the bottoming of prices was bad news. The study asserted: &quot;One must at least raise the question whether trade action of the kind exemplified by the sanctions against South Africa, haven't aggravated the competitive pressures already faced by U.S. coal exporters.&quot;    Joseph Yancik, an official with the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration, said he was aware of the study but hadn't yet seen it. &quot;When the administration decided to impose sanctions,&quot; he said, &quot;it was recognized that there would be some adverse effect on the U.S. economy.    &quot;But the purpose,&quot; he added, &quot;was to get the South African government to change its policies.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
