It is metamorphosed to amphibolite facies and regionallyretrograded and hydrothermally altered. Metamorphosed anorthosite, gabbro,pyroxenite, sulphide-bearing gabbros, thick magnetite layers, and granitesare compatible with the hypothesis that the Complex is a layered intrusion,tectonically rotated and intruded by younger, genetically unrelated granites.Increasing TiO/sub 2/ and decreasing V/sub 2/O/sub 3/ contents southwardsin the magnetites layers combined with a general southern dispositionof differentiated hornblende granite suggest that the Rooiwater Complexfaces south. Although the Rubbervale Formation is pervasively deformedand metamorphosed at the greenschist facies, field relations and isotopicand rare earth element data tentatively suggest that a genetic relationshipexists, the Rubbervale Formation being a possible roof to the Rooiwaterintrusion, being derived from the same or a similar undepleted magmaticsource. A paucity of ultramafic cumulates and up to 1,5 km of hornblendegranites may relate to a source magma more felsic than that of otherlayered intrusions. In order to determine model ages for the Eden pluton,the Free State hornblende granite, the Quagga quartz amphibolite, theRubbervale formation, and the Novengilla gabbro-anorthosite series. Rb-Srand Pb isotopic analyses were undertaken.</TEXT></DOC>
