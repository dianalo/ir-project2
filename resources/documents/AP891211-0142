The paper said he was referring to the kidnapping by Israelicommandos of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem preacher fromsouth Lebanon, on July 28.   On July 31, Shiite Moslem kidnappers of the Organization of theOppressed on Earth said they killed their American hostage Lt. Col.William Higgins in retaliation for the kidnapping.   Most of the 18 hostages held in Lebanon are believed to be inthe hands of Iranian-backed Shiite groups. They are eightAmericans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishmanand an Italian.   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985 in west Beirut.   The death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the election of themore pragmatic President Hashemi Rafsanjani gave rise to some hopesof Iranian pressure on the kidnappers to free their captives.   Before coming to Qatar, Besharati visited the United ArabEmirates as part of Iran's active contacts with the conservativeGulf Cooperation Council member states ahead of their annual summitDec. 18 in Oman.   Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and SaudiArabia make up the council, which generally supports the policiesof Iraq, Iran's long-time enemy.   Relations between Iran and the council states, with theexception of Saudi Arabia, have been steadily improving sincePersian Iran accepted the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire to theeight-year war with Arab Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
