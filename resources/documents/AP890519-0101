Ryzhkov was criticized Thursdayas ``ecologically illiterate'' by a Soviet parliamentarian who saidhis possible replacement will be debated when the new congressmeets next week.   The extraordinary criticism of the Soviet head of government,who also sits on the ruling Communist Party Politburo, came at anews conference on Soviet diplomatic initiatives to promote worldcooperation on environmental protection.   The remarks by Alexei V. Yablokov heralded a battle betweenRyzhkov and environmental activists elected to the 2,250-seatCongress of People's Deputies when it convenes its first sessionMay 25 to elect the Soviet premier, president and other officials.   ``We have serious reproaches to make to Comrade Ryzhkov,chairman of the Council of Ministers,'' said Yablokov, who also isa corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. ``He'secologically illiterate, and this issue will be discussed at theCongress of People's Deputies, and we'll discuss whether he shouldremain as chairman of the Council of Ministers.''   Other speakers, including Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F.Petrovsky, State Environmental Committee chairman Fedor T. Morgunand State Hydrometeorology Committee chairman Yuri A. Izrael _ allRyzhkov subordinates _ vigorously defended his ecology record.   ``A lot of sinful decisions were made several years ago,''Morgun said. ``But what is being done now in the Council ofMinisters and by General Secretary (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev andChairman Ryzhkov, well, I know their approach is very strict to theecological problem.''   But Yablokov charged that Ryzhkov, 59, had made several baddecisions since he was appointed head of government in September1985.   He gave only one example: the approval Ryzhkov allegedly gave ata Dec. 3 Council of Ministers meeting for construction of afive-plant chemical complex in western Siberia before anenvironmental impact survey or technical study had been made.   Yablokov said his fellow lawmakers should advance an alternativeto the economic development program being pursued by Ryzhkov'sgovernment, which some environmentalists contend is causingnationwide ecological ruin.   ``Even now proposals are made that something has to be done withthe economy, and we should probably come forward with an alternateprogram for economic development, and not only the program thatComrade Ryzhkov proposes,'' said Yablokov, 56, a biologist electedto the congress by Moscow-based scientific research institutes.   Speaking later to Western reporters, Yablokov said that in morethan 100 Soviet cities, the air is now 10 times more polluted thanhealth regulations allow, water in rivers like the Volga is toopolluted to drink, and many foods are laced with chemicals thatmake them harmful.   ``This is of great concern to us, and maybe Ryzhkov does nothave this information available, but we do, and we are allwitnesses of the situation,'' he said.   The lawmaker-scientist predicted Ryzkhov would be re-elected bythe congress, but not before he was given a ``dressing-down'' byenviromentalist deputies.   The man occupying the No. 2 Soviet protocol position behindGorbachev is a surprising candidate for controversy. Theex-director of a huge machine-building plant in the Urals, Ryzhkovwas regarded as a faceless technocrat until he took control of ahigh-profile Politburo commission overseeing relief efforts forvictims of the December earthquake in Armenia.   His popularity soared in Armenia, and when the party's CentralCommittee met in March to elect 100 deputies to the congress,Ryzhkov outscored Gorbachev. Twelve of the 641 party officialsvoting opposed Gorbachev's election, while only 10 objected toRyzhkov.   The congress, whose members were chosen in the Soviet Union'sfirst multicandidate elections in more than 70 years, is expectedto become the battleground for diverse causes as environmentalists,Baltic nationalists and other activists demand reforms.   Yablokov said the parliament should become the ``supreme power''in the country, and revealed that 39 of the 41 deputies elected inMoscow met Thursday to draft common resolutions to submit to thecongress on critical issues.   Andrei D. Sakharov, 1975 Nobel Peace laureate and human rightsactivist, wrote a resolution on Soviet interethnic relations; agroup of economists wrote another one on economic reforms; andYablokov said he was the author of the proposed resolution onecology.</TEXT></DOC>
