The lawmakers agreed to renew the basic thrust of thenation's agricultural policies for an additional five years,while embracing innovative proposals designed to give farmersa freer hand to plant what they want and a chance to make alittle more money under some circumstances. But budgetpressures, coupled with Republican insistence on freezingsubsidies at current levels, thwarted the Democrats fromprotecting farm income from rising production costs to theextent they wanted.</LP><TEXT>   For two weeks, partisan bickering had prevented anyprogress on the big-ticket commodity programs, withRepublican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, the panel's rankingminority member, threatening to create political havoc on thefloor if Midwestern Democrats forced through higher targetprices and loan rates. The committee was facing the prospectof 10-9 party-line split until Thursday, when CommitteeChairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) managed to broker acompromise on the last contentious issues.   The committee approved the huge package on a 15-4 vote,with Sens. Thomas Daschle (D., S.D.), Max Baucus (D., Mont.),Howell Heflin (D., Ala.) and Slade Gorton (R., Wash.)opposing it. &quot;There's not everything in here that everymember would want,&quot; Sen. Leahy said afterwards. But the bill&quot;makes sense for farmers and consumers and is within thebudget.&quot;   &quot;This bill will avoid a blood bath,&quot; said William Lesher,a Washington-based agricultural consultant, who expects it toundergo considerable changes on the floor and in conferencewith Senate farm lawmakers. The House Agriculture Committeehas finished work on its version of the 1990 farm bill. Flooraction is expected in both chambers by mid-July.   The legislation would give farmers the option to plant avariety of crops on 25% of the acreage they customarilydevote to subsidized crops. But in taking advantage of thisflexibility provision, farmers would forgo any subsidies onthat land. The objective is to have farmers make plantingdecisions in response to market signals, rather thanincentives created by farm-subsidy programs.   For all but one commodity, the bill would freeze targetprices and loan rates at the current levels for the next fiveyears, halting a five-year decline under the expiring 1985farm law. To spur oat production, the bill would boost thetarget price for oats 10 cents a year to $1.85 per bushel byfiscal 1994.   The government pays farmers subsidies whenever marketprices for commodities fall short of target prices. Thegovernment also lends money to farmers, who put up theiranticipated crops as collateral. If market prices fall belowso-called loan rates, farmers can forfeit their crops to thegovernment, instead of paying off the loans. The loan rate,in effect, acts as a minimum price.   Under the marketing-loan proposal for wheat, corn andother feed grains, the lawmakers would give the agriculturesecretary the option of lowering the basic loan rates as muchas 20% to keep U.S. commodities competitive on the worldmarket. But for each one-cent drop in the loan rate, farmerswould get an advance payment of three-fourths of a cent abushel, with the proviso that the advance be repaid. Thiswrinkle would reduce the need to borrow farm-operating fundsfrom banks.   Some of the innovations embraced by the committee arelikely to be challenged by the Bush administration. One hasbeen dubbed the &quot;high price bonus.&quot; If market prices arehigher than expected, and the government thus doesn't have topay out as much as projected in subsidies, the lawmakersproposed giving farmers two cents out of every 10 centssaved.   Another innovation would allow farmers in 15-county areasin at least four states to participate in a supply-managementexperiment. Grain farmers would be required to limit thenumber of bushels they sell each year, rather than the numberof acres they cultivate.   &quot;It doesn't make good economic sense,&quot; said Bruce Gardner,the Agriculture Department's top economist. Some Republicanlawmakers question how the government would enforce suchmarketing controls.</TEXT></DOC>
