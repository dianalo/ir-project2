STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A ransom of $22.2 million may havebeen paid to release a West German hostage despite a round ofdenials from his employer and government officials, a newspaperreported Wednesday.   The Hamburg-based mass-cirulation daily Bild said the money wasdeposited into Arabian bank accounts to secure the freedom ofRudolf Cordes, who arrived home Tuesday night after 20 months ofcaptivity.   Cordes, 55, Beirut manager for the Hoechst AG pharmaceuticalcompany, was released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnapperslate Monday night. He was first taken to Damascus, Syria.   Wolfgang Schaeuble, who heads the federal government's MiddleEast crisis group, strongly denied that money was paid for Cordes'release.   ``There were no deals. There were no conditions,'' saidSchaeuble.   ``The release was secured through talks and the help of Iranianand Syrian officials,'' he said, echoing earlier comments byForeign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   Schaeuble also said the government made no concessions in thecase of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who is on trial in Frankfurt oncharges of murder and air piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a TWAjetliner.   Justice Minister Hans Engelhard also said the government ``fromthe first moment on made it clear that there would be no deals, norelease in exchange for the West German hostages.''   Cordes and another West German, Alfred Schmidt, were kidnappedin Beirut in January 1987 after Hamadi was arrested at FrankfurtAirport.   Schmidt was released on Sept. 7, 1987.   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas, was convicted by a Duesseldorfcourt for his role in the kidnappings, which were designed topressure the government into releasing Mohammed Hamadi.   But Bild, citing unidentified security sources, stronglysuggested a ransom was paid.   ``Despite all denials by the West German government and theHoechst company, a sum of millions is believed to have been paid tokidnappers for the release,'' Bild said.   The newspaper quoted a source identified only as a ``securityexpert'' as saying that millions of dollars were paid for Cordes'release.   ``Such money is paid discreetly via front men into Arabian bankaccounts,'' Bild quoted a ``security expert'' as saying. ``InCordes' case there has been talk of at least 40 million marks($22.2 million).''   The newspaper is known to have good sources within thegovernment in Bonn.   The Frankfurt-based Hoechst company also denied that any moneywas paid and declared as false a magazine report that it had hireda private detective to deliver the money.   Hoechst spokeswoman Felicitas Feick said: ``Our company hadnothing to do with this man. No money was paid for Mr. Cordes'release.''   The Hamburg-based Stern magazine, in a telex to news media, saida man it identified as Werner Mauss was hired by the company toconduct negotiations and deliver money to the hijackers.   After his arrival at Cologne-Bonn airport Tuesday, Cordes wasimmediately flown to an undisclosed location. He remained inseclusion Wednesday.   Schaeuble told West German television that Cordes was ``weak butin good health.'' He said Cordes told him that he was kept isolatedand chained during most of his captivity.   ``He was moved often and was in a continuous state ofuncertainty. He told me he received few letters from hisrelatives,'' Schaeuble said.   Cordes was the last West German hostage in Lebanon, where 17other foreigners are held captive. The longest held is TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.Anderson was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
