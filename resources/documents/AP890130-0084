U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell quashed North's subpoena forPresident Bush to testify. He said North had made no showing thatBush ``has any specific information relevant and material'' to thecharges against North.   Gesell refused to quash North's subpoena for Reagan's testimonybut said in his three-page order there would be further proceedingsif it is found necessary to call the former president as a witnessin the trial.   The judge said there shall be ``no restriction placed upon''Reagan by the subpoena unless the court entered another order, afterhearing objections from the Justice Department and private counselto Reagan.   Gesell, acting a day before North's trial on 12 felony chargesbegins, quashed, with ``one narrow exception,'' North's subpoena forReagan's personal diary.   But the judge said portions of the diary might become part of thetrial ``if at some point'' North's defense team ``supports a claimthat President Reagan ordered, directed, requested or, with advanceknowledge, condoned any of North's'' alleged criminal activities inthe diversion of Iranian arm-sales profits to the Contra rebels inNicaragua.   In that event, said Gesell, ``an appropriate productionprocedure'' must be developed for reviewing the former president'sdiary and determining whether any of the entries support North'sassertions.   North contended in testimony at the congressional Iran-Contrahearings in 1987 that all of his activities were authorized bysuperiors in the Reagan administration and that he reported toformer national security advisers Robert McFarlane and John M.Poindexter.   Gesell's order implemented a tactic he had indicated at a hearingFriday he would use with regard to Reagan's testimony.   ``President Reagan shall remain subject to call on the ...subpoena'' served by North's lawyers last month for theex-president's testimony, said today's order.   Gesell said Friday that circumstances may change as evidence isintroduced at the trial and that testimony of certain individualsmay become relevant.   Gesell said that with regard to North's subpoena for Bush, theformer NSC aide's lawyers have ``made no showing that President Bushhas any specific information relevant and material to the charges ofthe indictment which makes it necessary or appropriate to requirehis appearance.''   Since North's indictment last March, his lawyers won dismissal offour of the original 16 counts _ including the key charges arisingfrom the diversion of the money to the Nicaraguan rebels.   But the retired Marine lieutenant colonel still faces a host ofother charges that carry a maximum possible sentence of 60 yearsimprisonment and fines totaling $3 million. His trial is set tobegin Tuesday.   The dismissal earlier this month of charges that North conspiredwith Poindexter and two arms dealers to finance the ``secret war''in Nicaragua with arms-sale proceeds basically leaves allegationsthat he covered up his activities by lying.   The former National Security Council aide is charged with makingfalse statements to congressional committees in 1985 that wereinvestigating reports he and others were helping the rebels inviolation of a ban on such assistance.   Three false-statement and obstruction charges allege that Northprepared false responses to written queries from congressionalcommittees. The letters denying that North or other NSC stafferswere improperly assisting the Contras were signed by McFarlane, thennational security adviser.   McFarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholdinginformation from Congress and is expected to testify against Northas a witness for Iran-Contra prosecutors.   North also is charged with obstructing an August 1986 inquiry bythe House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He is accusedof falsely denying, during a meeting with panel members at the WhiteHouse, that he helped the Contras.   Four other obstruction and false statement charges stem fromactions North allegedly took after the Iran-Contra affair becamepublic in November 1986.   He is charged with obstructing the presidential inquiry orderedby President Reagan by making false statements to then-AttorneyGeneral Edwin Meese III and by destroying National Security Councildocuments while Justice Department investigators were conducting theprobe.   The false statements included North's denial that the NSC staffwas involved in the diversion of arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguanrebels, known as Contras, the indictment charges.   An obstruction of Congress charge alleges that North helpedprepare a false chronology of the U.S.-Iran arms sales for anappearance by Poindexter before the House and Senate intelligencepanels.   Prosecutors also hope to prove that North personally benefitedfrom his involvement with the Iran-Contra affair. North is chargedwith accepting the installation of a $13,000 security fence aroundhis Great Falls, Va., home that was allegedly paid for by armsdealer Richard V. Secord, another co-defendant. The offense carriesa two-year sentence.   One of the four charges dropped against North was an allegationthat he prepared false documents to obstruct the grand jury'sinvestigation of the fence. U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesellruled that the charge was legally defective because the allegedobstruction occurred a month before the Iran-Contra grand jury wasimpaneled on Jan. 28, 1987.   He is also charged with converting to his personal use at least$4,300 of the $90,000 in travelers checks that Contra leader AdolfoCalero gave him to help defray costs of helping the rebels.   That offense carries a 10-year sentence and a $250,000 fine. Mostof the other charges carry five-year sentences, including a chargethat he conspired to use a tax-exempt foundation illegally to helpraise money to arm the Contras.   Two conservative fundraisers, Carl ``Spitz'' R. Channell andRichard R. Miller, have pleaded guilty to related charges and areprepared to testify against North about efforts to raise $3.2million from private donors for the non-tax exempt purpose offinancing the Contras.   Poindexter, Secord and arms dealer Albert Hakim are to be triedseparately from North.   It is likely that the major Iran-Contra conspiracy charges willbe dismissed against them as well, because the government isunwilling to allow disclosure of classified information contained inprosecution exhibits.   Poindexter, the former national security adviser, is charged withobstructing Congress and making false statements to variouscongressional investigations. Secord and Hakim are also charged withconspiring to pay illegal gratuities by installing the securityfence and setting up a Swiss bank account for North's children.</TEXT></DOC>
