In the framework of the present study, systematicinvestigations were effected on the extraction of oil shale with waterin the subcritical and hypercritical phases. For the investigations,a Colorado oil shale from the Piceance Creek Basin, Rio Blanco County,was used. The extraction experiments took place in a high-pressure autoclaveand in a flow apparatus under pressures of up to 320 bar and at temperaturesof up to 550/sup 0/C. The optimum temperatures for an extraction withhypercritical water lie between 400 and 450/sup 0/C. An extract withabout 11 per cent by weight of oil, 2.5 per cent by weight of asphalteneand 0.3 per cent by weight of preasphaltene can then be obtained fromthe applied Colorado oil shale with a kerogen content of about 18.4 percent by weight. In addition, 2 wper cent by weight of light oil can beobtained. Furthermore, about 0.7 per cent by weight of hydrocarbon gasesare formed, and 1.9 per cent by weight of coke remains in the inorganicresidue.</TEXT></DOC>
