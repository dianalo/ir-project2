Kennedy had asked Capt.andP;  KatherineLaughton, then-commander of the Navy's Automatic Data Processing SelectionOffice (ADPSO), to &quot;clarify the Navy's availability requirements&quot; as spelledout in the RFP and then accept new BAFOs.andM;Companion, a requirements contract designed to provide upgrades and supportfor the Defense Department's Zenith Data Systems Z-248 microcomputers, had anestimated value of as much as $800 million last year when a contract firstwas awarded.andP;  Navy officials said revised quantities in the amended RFP anddeclining prices will reduce that amount.andM;The Navy selected Zenith as its Companion contractor Nov. 1, 1989.andP;  TheGeneral Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals overturned thataward this year, however, finding that the laser printer and databasespecified by Zenith did not meet commercial availability requirements.andM;GSBCA instructed the Navy to terminate the agreement with Zenith and make anaward to one of the three remaining bidders, Government Technology ServicesInc. of Chantilly, Va.; Federal Computer Corp. of Falls Church, Va.; or SMSData Products Group Inc. of Reston, Va.andM;All three bidders renewed their protests this fall when the Navy still hadnot awarded Companion, asking GSBCA to lift or restrict the Navy'sprocurement authority.andP;  Those protests, together with motions to removeZenith from active participation in Companion, still are pending before GSBCAJudge Joseph Vergilio.andM;The Navy's reopening of the Companion BAFO process came Nov. 2.andP;  &quot;Asconfirmed by the Navy's in-depth review, some items proposed in the originalBAFOs are no longer available.andP;  Also, the declining price trends in the ADPindustry would indicate a significant potential dollar savings to thegovernment,&quot; a Navy statement said.andM;The principal change in the amended RFP deals with the commercialavailability question GTSI raised in its original protest.andP;  Products proposedin the new BAFOs must be announced formally for sale, either publicly orwithin the manufacturer's sales organizations, on or before Jan. 7, 1991.andM;The new RFP recognizes other concerns raised by protesting bidders.andM;GTSI's original protest accused the Navy of violating its own RFP by awardingthe contract not on technical merit but to the lowest bidder.andP;  In a letter tobidders, the Navy said it has not changed provisions in the RFP requiring itto recognize technical merit.andP;  The letter said the Navy is not necessarilyrequired to award to the vendor with the highest technical rating.andM;Although GTSI officials declined comment, sources close to the procurementprocess said that GTSI, acknowledged high scorer in technical points, almostcertainly would protest this provision.andM;The Navy also asked bidders to explain in their BAFOs any price &quot;which couldpotentially be viewed as either an 'unbalanced bid' or a 'mistake in bid,'&quot;and the live test demonstration now will take place after the award, ratherthan before it as called for in the original RFP.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
