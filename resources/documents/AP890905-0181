In contrast, most said, the Hondurans had been good allies,allowing the Contras free run of a large swath of territory ineastern Honduras.   ``We get along great with the Contras. They are good people,''said a Honduran soldier assigned to a small detachment based inYamales.   The United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollarshelping the Contras, but the end is in sight following a CentralAmerican agreement to disband the Contra army seeking to toppleNicaragua's Sandinista government.   The United States is still providing non-lethal aid, but severalContra commanders complained that even before this U.S. aid had beenuncertain, that conditions on the aid had limited the Contras'ability to fight a guerrilla war and had, in addition, made apeasant insurgent movement appear to be nothing more than a U.S.tool.   ``We never knew what position the United States was going totake,'' said Israel Galeano, Contra chief of staff.   He is one of a group of young and battle-hardened commanders whohave taken control of the fighting forces from what they call the``desk warriors'' of the Nicaraguan Directorate.   ``The desk commanders got too far away from the fighters,'' said``Commander Dimas,'' head of operations for the Contra general staff.   Officials at the Contras' offices in Miami said they could nolonger grant permission for journalists to visit Yamales, forinstance, because Galeano controls access to the base.   The young commanders say they know the Contras cannot survive asa fighting force in Honduras following the disbanding agreement Aug.7, so, despite a shortage of supplies, they are planning to leadtheir men back into the jungle to await Nicaragua elections set forFebruary.   U.S. officials and sources in the directorate say they fear thereturning soldiers will simply be wiped out by a vastly superiorSandinista force. But field commanders say they are confident theycan survive, and many fighters said that when they took up armsyears ago they never thought of U.S. aid.   The 29-year-old Galeano said his men won't attack Sandinistaforces but will defend themselves. He added that his strategy is tokeep his force operative as a means of pressuring the Sandinistas tohold fair elections.   ``We've been exploited. We've got to show the world we aren'tmercenaries of Reagan and Bush,'' said a battalion commander knownas ``Commander Nolan.'' He, like others, said the Contras werecreated by conditions inside Nicaragua and that the war would notend until those conditions change.   The United States provided military aid during the Reaganadministration, but that was cut off in February 1988.   On Aug. 7, presidents of the Central American countries agreed todisband the Contras by Dec. 8 in exchange for democratization inNicaragua. But most fighters interviewed recently saw the agreementas leaving them with options that range from bad to worse.   Few believe the promise of President Daniel Ortega of Nicaraguathat it is safe for them to return peacefully, and many see deathawaiting them in the Nicaraguan jungle.   ``It's immoral to send all these people to their deaths,'' saidNolan, who is planning to lead his own battalion, even though helost a lung in battle.   Galeano was the only commander who expressed any sympathy for theU.S. position, where the Reagan administration was unable to imposeits will on a Democrat-controlled Congress.   ``We understand the problems of a democracy that needs consensusto act,'' Galeano said in an interview. ``It's what we want for ourown people.''   The Aug. 7 agreement effectively took the Contra issue out of theHonduran presidential-election campaign, where a vote is set forNov. 26, two weeks before the deadline for disbanding the Nicaraguanrebels.   ``To Honduras, we'll say thank you and good-bye,'' said Dimas.``Effectively, they've been allies.''   President Jose Azcona Hoyo, who cannot run for re-election, saidthat if the Contras move out of Honduras as an armed force theirfate will be an ``an internal matter'' for Nicaragua and none ofHonduras' business.   Even so, Honduras has reinforced a battalion of the 110thInfantry Brigade that patrols the isolated hills and blocks theaccess road to the camps.   Many Hondurans have been upset by rumors that groups of Contraswould become bandits, but a Honduran soldier said, ``We can't stopthem from getting out individually.''   The Contra fighters worry about their families as well as about3,000 guerrillas who suffered crippling wounds.   ``We're going to ask the United States to take care of them,''Dimas said. ``That's the least they can do.''   The United States is providing medical aid and rehabilitation,and Contra leaders say they have been told refugees and the woundedwill be taken care of even after aid to the fighters runs out.   The fighters' families mostly live in nearby villages, refugeecamps and the small city of Danli, 80 miles to the west.   People there are very discouraged, said Enrique Rizo Lopez, aresettlement group spokesman. ``A lot of them want to go to theStates.''   U.S. officials point to a new aspect of the aid program: effortsto teach literacy, civics, and skills like barbering, cooking andeven oratory to the fighters, most of them poorly educated peasants.   ``I want to show them they still have supporters, they will notbe left alone,'' said a U.S. aide, a Nicaraguan-Americanschoolteacher from Hialeah, Fla., who gave his name only as Julian.   But a doctor who uses the name ``Ulysses'' said a U.S.-supportedhospital has been forced to suspend all but emergency services toboth Contras and local civilians. As he spoke, he tried to light acigarette.   ``It's like U.S. aid,'' he said, flicking a balky lighter. ``Itworks when it wants to.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Sept. 10</NOTE></DOC>
