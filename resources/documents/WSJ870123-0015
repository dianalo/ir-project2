Industry officials say the economies of scale made possible by the Air Force purchase should give McDonnell Douglas a strong base for establishing a commercial launch business for space satellites. Its principal competitor will be European Ariane rockets, although two other U.S. companies said they may still try to enter the field.    &quot;We think we may be in a position to drive the whole market,&quot; a McDonnell Douglas official says. He cites an Air Force study forecasting that the Delta II could capture as much as 70% of the current backlog in space satellites.    Analysts, meanwhile, say the price of the Delta II rockets in the Air Force order indicates that McDonnell Douglas could compete on a solid footing with European and other foreign competitiors.    The $669.3 million contract is a product of the recovery plan drawn up by the Air Force last year after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and the failure of an Air Force Delta rocket. The new launch vehicles will be used to carry medium-weight payloads into orbit. The Air Force intends to use its Delta IIs to launch global navigation satellites that initially were scheduled for launching on the shuttle.    To help defray costs, the Air Force order requires McDonnell Douglas to develop a version of the rocket designed to reestablish a commercial launch industry in the U.S. Industry sources say there currently is a backlog of about 30 to 45 commercial satellites awaiting launch.    Both General Dynamics Corp., which makes the Atlas rocket, and Martin Marietta Corp., producer of the Titan rocket, say they will reevaluate their programs after losing out to McDonnell Douglas in the Air Force competition. Each, however, indicates a continuing interest in entering the commercial market. &quot;Obviously the Air Force decision was a major setback,&quot; says a Martin Marietta official. &quot;But we think there is business out there for our product.&quot;    The primary advantage of the Delta II apparently was a price tag that averaged $33 million for each in a full order of 20 rockets. That compares with the estimated $100 million cost of the Martin Marietta Titan, which carries two satellites instead of the Delta II's one and is also capable of transporting larger payloads. The General Dynamics bid also is understood to have been substantially higher than the one for Delta II.    The European Ariane rocket can carry one large and one small satellite, costing approximately $80 million to $100 million, depending upon the specifications of the satellites, according to industry officials. Aerospace specialists said the unit costs of a rocket program decline sharply as volume increases.    The disadvantage of the Delta II is a smaller payload capacity than either the Titan, Atlas or Ariane. &quot;There are a number of satellites that are just too big for it to handle,&quot; one analyst says.    McDonnell Douglas, however, believes that technology will help make satellites smaller and smaller. &quot;The market is moving more and more in our direction,&quot; an official says.    For the next few years, aerospace executives say there should be more satellite business available than either the McDonnell Douglas or the European Ariane program can handle. U.S. officials believe the Ariane program is capable of launching a maximum of about 16 satellites a year, while McDonnell Douglas could begin launching as many as 12 rockets annually starting in late 1989 -- including seven Air Force payloads a year.    A McDonnell Douglas official says the company plans to increase its launch capacity to 18 rockets by 1991. Even so, analysts say that could leave as many as 10 other commercial satellites annually that could be launched by a third major competitor.    A National Aeronautics and Space Administration official says that of the 25 satellites that had firm schedules to fly on the shuttle, only 10 are still slated for shuttle deployment. The rest, he said, have been finding other rides -- including on proposed Chinese, Japanese and Russian launch vehicles.    &quot;The glut that has built up from the shuttle disaster will make it impossible for any launch program to satisfy demand in the next several years,&quot; says Louis C. Raburn, director of the Delta program at McDonnell Douglas. </TEXT></DOC>
