In the past threeyears, at least one out of every 14 companies on the BigBoard has experienced a securities-fraud suit, most of themalleging concealment or failure to disclose information, andclaiming significant monetary damages.   Proponents of securities class actions say that the suitsprevent fraud and help maintain the integrity of financialmarkets. The large number of cases and the settlements are,to them, evidence of the need for securities class actions.</LP><TEXT>   Are the proponents right? To shed some light on the issue,I collected data on more than 330 federal class-actionsecurities-fraud cases involving common stock, all of themwithin the past three years. In every case, the plaintiffsalleged material misrepresentations and omissions bymanagement regarding the true health and potential of thedefendant company.   I found, as have most other studies of the subject, thatvirtually all securitiesfraud class-action cases are resolvedthrough settlement. In my 330-case sample, only three caseswere decided by a jury; an additional five were dismissed orwithdrawn. All in all, 96% of securities class-action casesin my sample were settled out of court. The norm for mostother civil cases is 60% to 70%.   It is not the small investor who benefits from thislitigation. Individual stock buyers get little direct benefitfrom the class-action suits brought on their behalf. Most ofthe shareholder losses are suffered by large institutionalinvestors, and it is they who receive the bulk of thesettlements. In the most extreme case, five claimants out of302 -- the T. Rowe Price Horizons Fund, the Fidelity MagellanFund, the IDS Managed Retirement Fund, the Kemper TotalReturn Fund and Chase Manhattan Bank -- received 36% of thesettlements. In another case, with 4,952 approved claimants,52% of the settlement went to 1% of the claimants; not one ofthat 1% was an individual. In a third, just one out of 1,531claimants got more than 16% of the claim.   After, of course, deducting for attorneys' fees: theaverage attorney's award in the 330 cases was about $1million in fees and $250,000 in expenses, or a little morethan 21% of the average settlement amount. In 1990,settlements were announced for 83 cases, earning theplaintiffs' attorneys more than $100 million in fees andexpenses. A big part of these fees goes to a small handful ofplaintiffs' firms: While more than 120 firms were identifiedas plaintiffs' counsel, one or more of just seven of thesefirms were involved in 46% of the cases.   None of these facts would be especially objectionable ifthe lawsuits were in fact punishing and deterring wrongdoers.But despite the high settlement rate, the data don't supportsuch a sunny conclusion. Instead, regardless of size,profitability, industry type or location, any company whosestock price declines is open to a class-action suit.   Conventional wisdom says companies likely to be the targetof shareholders' wrath are small, new and probably hightech.But in fact, securities-fraud class-action suits are notconfined to any one type of company. While one-quarter of thedefendants in the sample of 330 cases were banking andinvestment companies and one-fifth were computer or softwarecompanies, more than half of the cases represented a widerange of industries: heavy equipment, entertainment, retail,pharmaceuticals and health care.   Nor did size make any difference. Companies with less than$10 million in revenues were sued as frequently as their $30billion brethren. While more than half of the companies suedhad less than $500 million in sales, fully 13% had annualrevenues exceeding $2.5 billion.   Being long established did not protect a company fromlitigation either. Nine percent of the companies sued hadbeen incorporated for five years or less, but 75% had existedas corporations for more than 10 years. Fewer than a quarterof the suits related to new securities offerings, and feweryet involved initial public offerings of stock.   One thing that virtually all the defendants did have incommon was a steep drop in the price of their common stock --49%, on average. In a handful of cases, the defendant companywas sued because the stock price went up. In these cases theplaintiff class consisted of investors who sold stock beforedisclosures, typically of mergers or takeovers, boosted theshare price.   Curiously, there is little variation in settlementamounts, both in real terms and as a percentage of investorlosses. This suggests that settlement payments are notdetermined on the merits of the cases but by other factors,perhaps insurance coverage. While the types of companies suedand the circumstances vary widely, settlement outcomes donot. One hundred and seventy-nine cases have reportedlysettled since April 1988. Two-thirds of the cases studiedsettled for less than $5 million; almost 85% for less than$10 million.   The settlement amount as a percentage of stockholderlosses was consistently low. In a random sample of 20 cases,I estimated actual trading patterns and calculated the totaltrading losses to stock buyers in the alleged damage period.I found that cash settlement amounts averaged about 6% oftotal trading losses for purchasers of common stock duringthe relevant period. Once again, the outcomes were highlyconcentrated in the lower end of the range; 12 of the 20cases settled for less than 5% of the trading losses.   Cash settlements in our sample provided less than a nickelin actual compensation for every dollar lost by investors,since attorneys' fees and administrative fees consumed, onaverage, 21% or more of the settlement fund.   In sum, virtually every company in every industry faces asignificant probability of being sued, most likely by one ofseven law firms. If past experience holds true, thelitigation will undoubtedly be settled and the amount of thesettlement will probably be less than $5 million. Investorswill receive only a tiny fraction of their losses, with mostof this being paid to sophisticated, professional investors.Plaintiffs' attorneys will divvy up more than $1 million infees. It is not likely that undergoing such a suit willimprove a company's way of doing business, nor is it likelyto deter fraud. Most important, the securities classactionsuit will seldom offer any benefit to the party it issupposed to champion: the stockholder.   ---   Mr. O'Brien is a principal of the Law and EconomicsConsulting Group, in Berkeley, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
