Treasury-auction scandal.   The shift wouldn't increase the amount of debt thegovernment sells annually, but would be used to deter cornersof the market by flooding Wall Street with securities on ashort-term basis. That plan, which would be put into effectimmediately, is outlined in a draft report of the four-monthreview of the Salomon scandal by the Treasury, the FederalReserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission. A copy ofthe study, to be released this week, was obtained by thisnewspaper.                                                                                                          In the study, the regulators also propose a plan todramatically change the way large investors and dealers bidfor the more than $1.5 trillion of securities sold in theauctions annually. The plan would end the current system ofsealed bidding in auctions, replacing it with bidding thatdealers could see as it occurred. The overhaul isn't possibleuntil the Treasury and Fed complete their automation of thestructurally antiquated auction process early next year, saythe agencies, who plan to ask market players for comment.   The report of more than 200 pages also recommends thatgovernment-sponsored agencies such as the Federal NationalMortgage Association be forced to register their securitieswith the SEC, a move they are sure to fight hard to block.   But the study's most significant determination is thethreat to head off squeezes in the market. Those squeezesoccur when a group of investors buy up the majority of thesecurities at auction and then don't make them available toothers who are &quot;short,&quot; or betting on a decline, and who needto replace borrowed securities.   That became a huge problem in the May auction, whenSalomon and its customers bought up about 90% of the two-yearnotes sold by the Treasury and then held the securities. Somemarket players lost millions of dollars in that auction, andcomplained bitterly to the government, setting off theinvestigation that led to Salomon's admission of cheating inthe market.   Short-sellers now will have less to fear. &quot;Effectiveimmediately, Treasury will provide the market with additionalsupply of any security that is the subject of an acute,protracted shortage,&quot; the report says. &quot;Treasury will notrequire evidence of manipulation in deciding whether toreopen a particular issue, but instead will reopen any issuethat, in its judgment, is the subject of such a shortage.&quot;   The move represents a dramatic change for the agency inthat for the first time, the Treasury would try to controlthe activities of the free market. In the past, the agenciesconcede in the report, they decided against interveningbecause it would have subjected the Treasury to future callsfor reopenings, could have forced investors to bid lessaggressively in future debt sales given the uncertainty ofreopenings, and would have upended the agency's previouslyset debt schedule.   But now the Treasury has decided that keepingshort-sellers in the market, which increases liquidity, istoo valuable. &quot;Market manipulation -- or even the perceptionof it -- can undermine the integrity of the marketplace . . .and produce higher costs for the taxpayer,&quot; the report says.   Specifically, the agencies are considering three options:The Treasury could directly offer $1 billion to $5 billionmore of a certain issue; the New York Federal Reserve Bank,at the Treasury's request, could sell more securities througha &quot;tap&quot; system, providing as much new debt as the marketneeds; and the Treasury could ask the Fed to lend securitiesto parties who need them, creating short-term additionalsupply.   The Treasury may never have to carry through on its newpolicy, which it will implement only for lengthy squeezes,not for &quot;natural&quot; short-term ones. Simply threatening to sellmore securities, which probably would lower the price of thebonds or notes, should be an ample financial preclusion toanyone who might want to corner a market, regulators hope.&quot;Even the threat of that should deter squeezes,&quot; says one Fedofficial.   Ironically, the plan was endorsed in the fall by WarrenBuffett just weeks after he became Salomon's interimchairman. &quot;The one thing that `does in' a corner or a squeezeis more supply,&quot; he told the House Telecommunications andFinance Subcommittee in September, offering his plan as &quot;asuggestion.&quot;   An industry spokeswoman applauded the move. &quot;If you have asevere and protracted shortage, doing something to make it goaway is something dealers would think ought to happen,&quot; saidHeather Ruth, president of the Public Securities Association.&quot;It's a completely legitimate concern of Treasury.&quot;   Other recommendations also are designed to head offsqueezes. For example, the report suggests that Congress passa law allowing the Treasury to require investors to reportlarge holdings of government securities. The Treasury wouldadopt such rules only if &quot;market problems persisted despiteother actions being taken.&quot; (The Fed dissented on this point,calling such reporting &quot;unnecessary.&quot;)   The suggested overhaul to the auction process also wouldhelp alleviate squeezes, the report concludes. Thecomplicated new open-bidding plan is designed to eliminatethe &quot;winner's curse&quot; of the current auction system, in whichinvestors who bid the highest price -- or lowest interestrate -- are awarded securities first. The current systemforces bidders to reduce offers, the report contends.   The new &quot;ascending-price plan,&quot; which the report says &quot;maybe superior&quot; to other alternatives, would work like this: TheTreasury would announce an opening yield somewhat above theone that the market is indicating the security will sell at.Players could then bid at that yield, after which theTreasury would announce the total volume of bids -- butwouldn't yet sell the securities. The offering would likelybe oversubscribed because it would be at abovemarket yieldsor below-market prices, which move inversely to yields.   The Treasury would then trim the yield by a hundredth of apercentage point, and the bidding process would begin anew.Bidding would continue at decreasing interest rates, perhapsin 10-minute intervals, until the demand was less than theamount for sale. Then, players who bid in the last roundwould get their securities at the next-higher yield; thosewho bid in the next-to-last round but dropped out wouldreceive prorated awards at the same yield.   The report also determines that bidding problems inauctions occurred after the Salomon investigation wasannounced. In particular, dealers arranged to buy notes andbonds for their own accounts by bidding for customers in the&quot;noncompetitive&quot; bidding process. That is where investors,usually smaller players, can bid for as much as $5 million ofnotes or bonds with the agreement that they will buy thosesecurities at the average yield.   Previously disclosed abuses of the noncompetitive systemhad centered only on abuses before the Salomon scandal. Thereport says the Fed and Treasury are stepping up surveillanceof the process and that egregious cases will be referred tothe SEC for enforcement action.   On another enforcement front, the report makes it clearthat dealers convicted of, or who plead guilty or no contestto, felony charges will be &quot;subject to {Fed} suspension asprimary dealers.&quot; While that always had appeared to be thecase, the report states it definitively, with a clear eye toSalomon, which is the target of criminal and civilinvestigations.   Separately, the report recommends that Fannie Mae andother government-sponsored agencies be required to registertheir securities with the SEC. Previous attempts by the SECand Treasury to force such a move for the stock and unsecureddebt of these agencies have been foiled by vehement lobbying.   Those securities traditionally have been exempted from SECscrutiny because of their historical link as an arm of thefederal government. But the agencies have since becomeprivatized and now the government wants to eliminate theexemptions.   Even before seeing the report, Fannie Mae launched apre-emptive strike. A spokesman said Fannie Mae believes thatSEC registration is unnecessary, would add to costs for homebuyers and could hurt the agency's financing flexibility.   Other actions in the report include:   -- Seeking legislation to toughen enforcement of auctionrules.   -- Leaving the limit that any firm can bid in any Treasuryauction at 35%.   -- Not forcing large bidders to bid directly to theTreasury instead of through dealers.   -- Changing the primary dealer system to end a requirementthat primary dealers maintain a 1% share of the totalcustomer activity reported by all such dealers.   -- Ending dealer surveillance by the New York Fed, thoughincreasing the bank's market oversight.   -- Planning to issue for comment this week a set of itsauction rules.   -- Setting up a surveillance working group for the market.   The study has no effect on the continuing civil andcriminal investigations into the Salomon scandal.   ---   John Connor contributed to this article.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
