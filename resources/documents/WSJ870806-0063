LeeStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TXPETROLEUM (PET)BANKRUPTCIES (BCY) </IN><TEXT>   On the surface, few people seem more suited to play a starring role in the $10.3 billion Wild West shootout between Texaco Inc. and Pennzoil Co. than real-life cowboy Robert C. Norris.    A lean 6 feet 2 inches, Mr. Norris has the chiseled features, steady gaze and low-key demeanor associated with movie Western heroes. Indeed, the 58-year-old Colorado rancher played the archetypal cowboy in Marlboro cigarette commercials.    But Mr. Norris hasn't been cast in the Texaco-Pennzoil horse opera because of his Charlton Heston-like good looks. He's the scion of one of Texaco's oldest and largest shareholding families, and last week he was named chairman of the equity holders committee monitoring Texaco's bankruptcy-law case.    Mr. Norris represents most of the interests of the Norris family, which owns about 650,000 of Texaco's 246 million shares outstanding, and has been connected with the company since its founding in 1902. He won't comment about the Texaco-Pennzoil war other than to say, &quot;We're committed to Texaco and want to see that it stays strong.&quot;    Mr. Norris says the committee, composed of nine shareholders who each owns at least 25,000 shares, is still organizing and isn't prepared to issue official opinions on the proceedings. But several members have publicly expressed their individual support of Texaco management. Texaco has about 228,000 holders.    The equity holders committee could play a bigger role than Texaco's two creditors' panels in determining how the company emerges from bankruptcy-law proceedings because shareholders could be hurt more than creditors. The White Plains, N.Y.-based company filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in April to forestall enforcement of a $10.3 billion judgment against it awarded to Pennzoil in 1985. The judgment arose from Pennzoil's claim that Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co. had illegally interfered with a Pennzoil agreement to acquire a part of Getty.    Bankruptcy specialists say it is possible that any Texaco reorganization plan containing a settlement to Pennzoil could involve some dilution of equity in order to pay creditors.    &quot;Equity holders' interests could be impaired and their approval of a plan will be essential,&quot; says Jack Gross, a bankruptcy specialist at the New York law firm of Stroock andamp; Stroock andamp; Lavan.    Mr. Norris, who owns a large but unpretentious horse and cattle ranch outside Colorado Springs, says he is neither an oil nor bankruptcy expert, but can hold his own against the bevy of pinstriped lawyers and other interested parties connected with Texaco's Chapter 11 proceedings.    &quot;They put their pants on just like I do,&quot; says Mr. Norris, who himself feels most comfortable in Western-style boots, hats and suede jackets.    On a more substantive level, he feels his tenure as president of the 150,000-member American Quarter Horse Association in 1982 prepared him to handle shareholder interests in the Texaco case. &quot;In the association you have to address the concerns of the large breeder and your backyard breeder; it's the same with your large and small shareholders,&quot; he says.    Association officials laud his executive skills. &quot;He was very low-key but very effective, fair and honorable&quot; as president, says spokesman Don Treadway. &quot;Some issues he was adamant on, but he didn't beat people over the head.&quot;    The Norris family's ties with Texaco go back to the company's beginnings. Mr. Norris's mother, Dellora Angell Norris, was heir to her uncle, John Warne &quot;Bet-A-Million&quot; Gates, a Texaco founder, freewheeling entrepreneur and gambler of some repute.    &quot;As a barbed-wire salesman he once bet cattle ranchers near the Alamo that they couldn't drive their herds through one of his fences,&quot; Mr. Norris relates. &quot;He started taking orders from them when he won.&quot;    Mr. Norris's father, Lester, an Illinois banker and philanthropist, served on Texaco's board from 1933 to 1973.    But while his father concentrated his business activities on Illinois and Florida, Mr. Norris sought his fortune and a solution to his persistent sinus problems in Colorado, where he and his family moved in the early 1950s.    Mr. Norris fit so well in his new surroundings that Philip Morris Cos. used him as a model in its Marlboro cigarette commercials in the '60s and early '70s. &quot;The ad agency wanted to use my ranch because of the mountain background scenery and the horses,&quot; Mr. Norris remembers. But while the crew was making up the model to look like a real cowboy, the director changed his mind.    &quot;'Norris is already dirty, so we'll use him,'&quot; Mr. Norris recalls the director saying. &quot;That was the start of a different style of livelihood,&quot; he says.    Mr. Norris's latest vehicle, the equity holders committee, has a way to go to catch up with the creditors panels, which were formed in late April. The committee met for the first time last week and hired a law firm, Chicago-based Keck, Mahin andamp; Cate. Before the committee's meeting yesterday, it hadn't decided whether it will hire an investment banker and accounting firm to advise it. And it also hadn't determined whether it will allow two public pension funds -- California Public Employees Retirement System, which owns a million shares, and Pennsylvania Public School Employes' Retirement System, which owns 544,000 -- to become nonvoting members.    &quot;We'll eat the apple one bite at a time,&quot; he says. &quot;We'll get everything we need to get the job done.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
