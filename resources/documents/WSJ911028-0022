It's justtaking a snooze.   That's how a lot of money managers are sizing up the bondmarket nowadays. With billions of dollars on the line, theseinstitutional investors say they don't see a long-term trendin the recent bond-price slump that has left 30-year Treasurybonds yielding 8.04%.</LP><TEXT>   Instead, they expect bond prices to tread water or evendecline a little more for several weeks, but then start torise again later this year or early next year.   Weighing on bond prices lately has been a certain amountof selling by money managers who are entering the period whentheir annual bonuses are calculated; they want to protecttheir stellar track records this year.   The recent bond price drop -- which interrupted a strongthree-month rally -- was triggered by talk of tax-cut feverin Washington. Both Republicans and Democrats have offeredtax cut proposals as a way to boost the sagging economy.   But bond investors fear that tax cuts could result in abigger federal deficit. The prospect of an expanding deficitis bad for the bond market because it means the governmentwill have to borrow more, pushing up interest rates.   Also rattling the bond market is the impending deluge ofnew bonds due to be sold next week by the government.Analysts believe that the Treasury will sell between $38billion and $39 billion of bonds, including about $12 billionof new 30-year bonds. Details of the auction will be releasedWednesday.   Many institutional investors believe that the brouhahaover tax cuts and heavy supplies of bonds will soon blowover.   But in the meantime, to protect the profits they racked upwhen bond prices were rising sharply, some of these investorsare selling a portion of their long-term bonds and using theproceeds to invest in safer, short-term bills and notes.   The major bond market indexes show that the averageportfolio has produced a total return so far this year ofabout 10% for Treasurys and 12% for investment-gradecorporates. Total return consists of price gains plusinterest income on the bonds.   Bruce Whiteford, an investment manager at Chase ManhattanU.S. Private Banking, which has a bond portfolio of about $5billion, has been a recent seller of Treasurys andmunicipals. He wants to lock in the profits he already hasachieved this year, in case prices slip any farther in thenear term.   &quot;Ultimately, the market will be all right . . . but rightnow we think the upcoming supply could cause rates to risetemporarily before trending down again,&quot; he said.   Mr. Whiteford says he'll probably be back in the market asa buyer after or around the time of next week's quarterlyrefunding of the federal debt.   Nancy Lazar, executive vice president and economist atInternational Strategy andamp; Investment Group Inc., said the typeof repositioning Mr. Whiteford has undertaken is typicalright now.   &quot;Investors have made nice gains this year, and they don'twant to lose them. They don't want to have a bad Christmas,either,&quot; said Ms. Lazar. That's why &quot;they're reducing theirrisk&quot; in the market, she said.   Each week ISI surveys 50 large institutional investors inan effort to measure bond market sentiment. Last week, 52% ofthe investors polled by ISI said they were bullish on thebond market, down from 57% in the previous week and 65% inlateSeptember.   The latest reading suggests that investors are largelyneutral. But many of these investors expect to be buyers ofbonds again later this year, Ms. Lazar said.   The reason is that investors still believe that theeconomy is weak and that inflation isn't a problem. And theystill expect the Federal Reserve to reduce short-terminterest rates another notch -- a climate that could boostbond prices.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Bond prices were weighed down by an influx of new supplylast week and the prospect of more to come next week.   The Treasury auctioned $13.5 billion of two-year noteslast Wednesday and $9 billion of five-year notes lastThursday. This week, the Treasury will announce details ofthe next quarterly refunding of the federal debt, expected tototal between $38 billion to $39 billion of three-year,10-year and 30-year securities.   The bond market's benchmark security, the latest 30-yearTreasury bond, fell nearly 1/4 point to a price of 100 25/32,a loss of nearly $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction ofits price, rose to 8.04% from 8.03%.   Prices declined Friday despite grim economic news. TheNational Association of Realtors reported that sales ofexisting single-family homes in the U.S. fell 4.3% inSeptember to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3,110,000.   That news followed Thursday's reports of asharper-than-expected drop in durable goods orders inSeptember and a stronger-than-expected increase in initialclaims for state unemployment insurance benefits.   In the municipal market, more than $1.3 billion of debt isscheduled to be sold. One deal expected to garner a largeamount of attention is California's competitive saleWednesday of $441 million of general obligation bonds.   Market participants will be eying the pricing levels onthe California GOs to determine how investors feel about theviews contained in a recent municipal analyst report. Thereport forecast that the state's ailing economy coupled witha growing lower-income population in need of services coulddrop California's gilt-edged triple-A rating to double-A in1992 or 1993.   On the economic front, the government will releaseestimates of third-quarter gross national product reporttomorrow, followed by September new single-family home salesand personal income data on Wednesday. The most significantdata comes Friday when the Labor Department releases Octoberemployment statistics.</TEXT></DOC>
