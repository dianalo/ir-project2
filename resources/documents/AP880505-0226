Citing a ``major mess'' in state government, the Republicanofficials demanded that Dukakis take an unpaid leave of absence,but stopped short of calling for his resignation.

His press secretary, JamesDorsey, said Thursday Dukakis will not step aside.   ``We are persuaded that this is partisan tomfoolery and asomewhat befuddled attempt by the Republican leadership todemonstrate that it has a sense of humor,'' Dorsey said.

Koch will travel to Ireland withCardinal John O'Connor this summer to protest violence in NorthernIreland rather than attend the Democratic National Convention.   ``I'm not going. I'm going to Ireland. That decision to go toIreland was made on St. Patrick's Day when I was asked to go,'' themayor said in an interview.   He said the dates of the visit to Ireland conflicted with thoseof the party convention in Atlanta. The convention is scheduledfrom July 18 to 21 while the Cardinal's trip is set for July 21 to27.   The mayor, who had hoped to go to the convention to lead a draftmovement for Gov. Mario Cuomo, had come under sharp criticism forhis attacks on Jesse Jackson in the New York state primary lastmonth.   He had supported Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee over Jackson andGov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the front-runner for theparty nomination, after Cuomo withdrew his name for a draft.   Koch later said he had told Dukakis, who won the New Yorkprimary, that he would be ``a soldier in his army.''</TEXT><HEAD>Schroeder Returns $24,000 From Aborted Presidential Campaign</HEAD><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep.
