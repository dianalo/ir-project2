The disclosure marks the first sign of any response from Standard to the proposed giant merger and raises the possibility that Standard might not rubber-stamp the bid. BP already owns 55% of Standard. It isn't clear whether Standard managers and directors favorably regard BP's bid, or if their opinion will make any difference in the outcome of the offer.    In Cleveland, a Standard spokesman said a special committee of directors is still reviewing BP's offer. Standard may make a statement about the offer in the near future, he said.    In its tender-offer documents, BP said it began contemplating making an offer for Standard in late November, and unveiled the idea to Standard's board at a special meeting on March 9. About two weeks later, BP showed Standard a draft of its offer and asked Standard to review it for accuracy.    According to the documents, the special committee of outside Standard directors gave BP a guarded response. The committee's chairman, Westinghouse Electric Corp. chief executive Douglas D. Danforth, telephoned BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters and told him the planned tender offer wouldn't give the committee enough time to evaluate BP's price. The offer is due to expire April 28 at 11:59 p.m. EST.    On Monday, the committee's lawyer wrote to BP, asking the company to postpone its offer for one to two months. The next day, Standard's general counsel, George J. Dunn, notified BP's counsel that certain information in its draft offer was inaccurate or &quot;competitively sensitive.&quot;    According to the documents, BP's lawyer responded yesterday simply by reaffirming the company's intention of making a tender offer for Standard.    It wasn't clear from the tender-offer documents whether the Standard committee's response represented genuine reservations to BP's bid. Wall Street sources suggested that the directors also might have been eager to forestall any grumbling or lawsuits from shareholders by going through all the motions of questioning BP's bid.    A source close to the negotiations between BP and Standard indicated that the merger is still by no means a finished deal, even though BP already has launched its offer. &quot;It's still early in the game -- it's just starting,&quot; the source said.    Some hopeful arbitragers, who have been heavily bidding up the price of Standard's stock, saw the new disclosures as a sign that Standard may extract a higher price from BP. &quot;It shows that the independent committee's really going to be independent and fight,&quot; said one arbitrager. &quot;The one fear that Standard's shareholders had was that the fix was in,&quot; he continued, &quot;but this shows there's some friction and independence which is great.&quot;    Standard's stock closed yesterday at $70.875 a share, up 62.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    As previously reported, at least one securities lawyer has filed a class-action suit on behalf of minority holders, arguing that BP is offering &quot;a fraudulently low and unfair price.&quot; The suit is an effort to spur a replay of a similar oil-industry merger battle: the 1984-85 struggle for Shell Oil Co. Royal Dutch/Shell Group was forced to raise its bid twice for the 30.5% of Shell it didn't already own, amid protests from minority shareholders and outside directors of Shell.    The British company said its offer doesn't depend on any minimum number of shares being tendered. It said its shareholders will vote on the merger at a special April 22 meeting.    BP said it will pay its investment banker, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., eight cents for each share it acquires in the tender offer, which would amount to roughly an $8.5 million fee if BP buys all the 105.8 million Standard shares it doesn't already own.    In addition, BP disclosed that Goldman Sachs considered several restructuring moves for Standard, including putting its Prudhoe Bay and Trans-Alaska Pipeline holdings into master limited partnerships and spinning off its refining and marketing operations to shareholders. Goldman figured such moves could generate $1.4 billion to $2.6 billion but concluded that they were too risky to recommend to BP.    BP said its bid for Standard will cost about $7.5 billion, including fees. It said about a third of the costs will come from inside BP. The remainder will come from a group of commercial banks and an issue of BP commercial paper in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
