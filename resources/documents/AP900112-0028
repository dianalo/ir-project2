The settlement gives weight to allegations by a third blackagent, Donald Rochon, who is suing the FBI for alleged racialdiscrimination when he worked in those two offices, his attorneysaid.   ``It does confirm that Donald Rochon wasn't the only black whowas harassed and discriminated against by whites in these same twooffices,'' attorney David Kairys said on Thursday.   Attorneys for Leadell Lee, an agent assigned to the Chicagofield office, and Gertie Armstrong, a clerk in Omaha, said theyreached separate settlements of the complaints last summer.   Kairys said he plans to call both Ms. Armstrong and Lee aswitnesses if Rochon's case goes to trial. Both could provideevidence of a pattern of racial harassment that existed in theOmaha and Chicago field offices, he said.   Rochon's lawsuit suit in federal court in Washington claims hewas the butt of racial jokes and death threats when he was assignedto the Chicago field office.   His claims of harassment in Omaha were upheld in administrativeproceedings and are not part of the lawsuit in federal court inWashington.   The lawsuit accuses FBI supervisors of tolerating racialharassment against Rochon and his family and retaliating againsthim for complaining. Rochon is now assigned to the Philadelphiafield office.   The FBI declined to comment about the settlements. SpokesmanGreg Jones confirmed there were two settlements but would not givefurther details, saying bureau policy prohibited disclosure of eventhe names of the complainants.   The settlement last July of Lee's complaint resulted in thedismissal of his civil rights lawsuit filed in federal court inChicago, said the agent's attorney, Patricia Motto.   Lee, who is now assigned to a suburban Los Angeles FBI office,claimed that he was denied promotions because he was black. Thelawsuit also claimed that he was the victim of racial pranks.   Lee testified in a pre-trial deposition that fellow agentsposted on the office's bulletin board a picture of a fat black manwearing underwear and smoking a cigar.   Beneath the picture, someone had placed the caption: ``Leefinally gets his promotion to supervisor in Watts,'' a reference tothe black ghetto in Los Angeles, Ms. Motto said.   On another occasion, he received a typewritten letter entitled``Twenty Thousand Niggers in Heaven.''   Ms. Motto said that her client reached the settlement withoutreceiving a promotion. She declined to say if Lee was given amonetary settlement.   ``All I can say is the matter was resolved satisfactorily,'' shesaid.   Rochon and Lee worked together in the Chicago field office atthe same time for a brief period but were assigned to differentsquads, Ms. Motto said.   The Omaha case involves a black FBI clerk who twice complainedto the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission about racialdiscrimination that resulted in her being fired twice.   Following her first dismissal, the EEOC ordered Ms. Armstrong'sreinstatement with back pay, after finding she was the victim ofracial discrimination, said Omaha attorney Clyde Christian.   After her return to the Omaha field office, the racialharassment resumed, Christian said.   Ms. Lee complained, was dismissed again, and filed a second EEOCcomplaint, which was settled last August, he said.   Under the settlement, Ms. Armstrong was rehired ``with allbenefits lost'' and transferred to the Cincinnati field office,Christian said.   Christian said the FBI's willingness to settle reflected adetermination by FBI Director William Sessions ``to get thedepartment a new image.''   Christian said the bureau's lawyers had been taking a hard-lineposition on the case but ``things started to change change in early1989.   The settlements occurred shortly before Sessions disclosed thatthe FBI would not appeal a sweeping court order to end what afederal judge in Texas found to be sweeping discrimination againstHispanic agents.   In that case, U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton III of Midland,Texas, ordered an overhaul of promotion practices to ensure thatHispanics receive consideration for supervisory jobs.   Since he took office in late 1987, Sessions has reviewed bureauhiring and promotion policies. Last year he hired an equalemployment opportunity manager whom he says reports directly to him.</TEXT></DOC>
