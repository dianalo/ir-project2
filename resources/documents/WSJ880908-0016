A West Coast Drexel broker who asked not to be identified said Drexel Chairman Frederick Joseph and Drexel attorneys addressed employees on a one-hour phone hookup from New York at 3 p.m. PDT, about 90 minutes after the case was announced. In summary, the broker said, &quot;they didn't think that the charges were as bad as they could have been&quot; and that there were &quot;no surprises.&quot;    They were told that a Drexel hotline had been set up so that employees and their families could have questions answered about the situation, the broker said.    Mr. Joseph told employees to have faith and confidence in the company, and assured them Drexel is strong financially. Previously, employees had been cautioned to avoid talking to the press, and had been told that conversations with the media could cost them their jobs.
