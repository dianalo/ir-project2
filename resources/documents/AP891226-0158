Japan's economy is predicted to hum along at an annual growthrate close to 5 percent, the best among the big industrialdemocracies and the powerful engine helping other fast-growingeconomies like South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore _ the``Little Dragons.''   The only real problem Japan faces as the 1990s begin is in thepolitical realm. The governing, pro-business Liberal DemocraticParty, beset by scandals and an unpopular tax, is heading for acrucial election, most likely in February.   The Japanese electorate will have a chance to pass judgment onwhether the cozy government-business relationship that has helpedmake Japan rich is too corrupt to continue. The result is hard topredict, though it seems likely that a political stalemate willharden, doing nothing to change Japan's postwar reputation forsterile politics.   Japan and the Little Dragons harnessed well-educated, dedicatedwork forces to the aim of exporting, with the huge U.S. market asthe target. Their success, however, has finally stung the Americangiant into demanding reciprocal export markets.   The old formula for economic success in the Far East thus is inquestion, and countries are increasingly looking to each other asmarkets. With Washington's backing and initial membership, aconference of Asia-Pacific nations was held in Australia in 1989 toimprove economic coordination.   Japan's overall trade surplus has declined but the troublesomesurplus with the United States seems stuck around $50 billion ayear. American demands for quality Japanese consumer products,machinery and high-tech gear are unlikely to abate.   Trade negotiators will be busy for the foreseeable future asWashington seeks greater sales in Japan's market. The U.S. strategynow is to change fundamental ways of doing business in Japan, andU.S. officials can expect tough slogging.   Traveling right behind the negotiators are businessmen from theUnited States _ and many other countries _ seeking niches inJapan's lucrative market.   Other countries in the region will be similar targets of theinternational businessman, and, like Japan, the explorer will findin them vibrant local markets and complex political situations.   Hong Kong, for instance: the British colony is to revert toChinese rule in 1997, and the question now is how many of the 5.6million people will still be in Hong Kong then. The colony's moraleslumped in June when the Chinese army stamped out the pro-democracymovement, and the future of Hong Kong depends on developments inBeijing and London.   China casts a shadow over other Far Eastern economies. It hadbecome a key source of cheap labor and land for businessessearching for lower overhead costs. The stunning politicalrepression in Beijing set back many plans for investment in China.   While South Korea and Taiwan moved forward with democraticpolitical reforms, the Philippines' young democracy took a heavyshock in December with a bloody military coup attempt. Themutineers probably shot as many holes in the country's chances forstrong economic growth as they shot in the high-rises of the Makatidistrict of Manila where the coup sputtered out.   Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesiaare bidding to follow the region's other new economic powers.Cambodia is in perpetual civil war and Vietnam is so poor that itscitizens are still fleeing almost 15 years after the Indochina Warended.   Vietnam, however, may be a new entry in the region'seconomic-growth stakes if it is able to shed the pariah status itearned by invading Cambodia.   The Vietnamese occupation officially ended in September after 10years, an indication of how long it can take to make a politicalchange in the region. Burma, for instance, remains stuck with anauthoritarian government.   And North Korea's communist regime, still under the helmsmanshipof Kim Il Sung after 44 years, was not steering to EastEuropean-style political changes as the decade ended. The leader'sson and possible successor, Kim Jong Il, said the North Koreanparty ``must on no account admit heterogeneous ideas into it. Inparty activity, the unity of action based on a single ideology canbe realized through monolithic leadership.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday, Dec. 31</NOTE></DOC>
