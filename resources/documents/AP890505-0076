The draft document provides options for pollution controlranging from assessing health risks against industry costs, tosetting standards for 125 pollution categories to leaving the wholematter up to the states.   The draft's options on airborne toxins are to be reviewed byBush's Domestic Policy Council before going to the president with arecommendation as part of his Clean Air Act revision plan. The planalso will include sections on acid rain and attainment of urbanozone standards.   Some environmental activists who obtained the document denouncedits proposals as too weak to protect the public against airbornepoisons.   The draft deals with the attempt to arrest the 2.7 billionpounds of poisonous chemicals that the EPA estimates are releasedinto the atmosphere each year.   The EPA is now required to assess the risk of each chemical, andthen develop a chemical-by-chemical emissions standard designed to``protect the public health within an ample margin of safety.''   Analysts from the environmentalist Natural Resources DefenseCouncil on Thursday attacked the draft proposals as a weak effort.   ``None of the options are going to protect the public from toxicair emissions,'' said NRDC resource specialist Debbie Shieman. TheNRDC is a private, non-profit organization.   She criticized the principles listed in the document, whichstated only that reductions should be achieved ``as soon aspossible,'' and that reduction of health risk be ``balanced againsteconomic and technical feasibility considerations.''   Clean air bills are already pending in Congress and more areexpected to be introduced. Bush's plan is expected to be readywithin a month.   The draft lists three initial regulatory options for industrialpolluters.   The first would set an ``unreasonable risk standard'' to balancethe benefits of regulation against its cost. This standard, thedocument said, ``could be coupled with a commitment to address aspecific list of the industrial sources posing the greatest risk,''with a period of perhaps three to five years.   The document acknowledged that such an approach likely ``wouldbe criticized as not protective of public health.''   The second option would turn the standards question over to thestates, and have each state issue permits for individual industrialpolluters, specifying acceptable emission levels.   The third option would list ``about 125 industrial categoriesfor control on schedules requiring controls by dates 5 to 12 yearsafter promulgation.''   This alternative would rely on polluters using ``maximumavailable control technology,'' to control emissions.   Newly constructed pollution sources would have to use the bestachievable technology to cut pollution, but the option said thatmust be done ``considering costs and technical feasibility.''   Existing polluters would use technology defined as the ``maximumachievable `in common practice' by the `better performingsources.'''   It would also allow exemptions for several categories ofpolluters.   That ``common practice'' language, said NRDC clean airspecialist Dick Ayres, is worrisome because ``common practice''could be read as current procedures that do not necessarily employthe best technology.   One administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said it was unclear when the draft would be considered by Bush'sDomestic Policy Council of advisers, which includes Cabinet membersand key officials who advise Bush on domestic matters.   Airborne toxins are one part of the package, which will alsoinclude smog and acid rain, that the Bush administration ispreparing to propose as a new Clean Air Act.</TEXT></DOC>
