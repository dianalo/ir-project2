Some producers stress that gas may soon bein very short supply. On the other hand, the American Gas Associationsays that gas will be available in large quantities at competitive prices,indefinitely. The author remarks on this topic reflect his own viewsand may not be those of Arco Oil and Gas Company. The author's themeis life is simple if you have no choice, but we know that the gas industryis becoming more complex for both buyers and sellers. Three areas arediscussed. First, some general observations about the current naturalgas market place, from a producer standpoint - without griping. Second,the medium to long-term supply outlook, recognizing the resource base.Finally, a discussion of the need for long-term contracts as a risk-sharingdevice for procuring natural gas supplies. The latter may be especiallyrelevant for combined-cycle power generators.</TEXT></DOC>
