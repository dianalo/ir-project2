Speaker Thomas Foley predicted the House would pare Bush's callfor $4.7 billion for the so-called stealth bomber for the fiscalyear that begins Oct. 1. He said the plane ``will survive in someform of limited procurement.''   Bush summoned lawmakers to the White House and Foley offered hisprediction as both houses began work on differing versions ofdefense legislation. Debate was expected to consume several days inboth houses.   Facing growing opposition to the stealth bomber, Bush personallylobbied members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and otherleading senators, urging support for the ``revolutionary plane withrevolutionary technology.''   ``We need the utmost flexibility in terms of arms control,'' thepresident said, dismissing complaints about the bomber's high pricetag _ $70 billion for 132 planes, or $530 million a copy.   On Capitol Hill, Vice President Dan Quayle conceded that thePentagon should have released the cost estimates on the bomberearlier than it did. The bomber program, shrouded in secrecy for 10years, has become more public with the release of figures lastmonth and the aircraft's first flight last week.   ``Those numbers should have been revealed publicly a lot soonerthan they were,'' Quayle told reporters during a meeting in hiscongressional office. ``It would have made (the political battle) alot less complicated and much easier.''   The vice president, who plans to spend Tuesday lobbying forBush's version of the defense budget, indicated that theadministration faces a tougher fight in the House than in theSenate.   While House members clashed in general debate over the B-2 andStar Wars, the Senate approved by a vote of 91-to-0 an amendment toadd $596.8 million in fiscal 1990 and $336.8 million in fiscal 1991for tactical missiles, which includes the Stinger and TOW.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, said the Senate could expect a difficult conferencefight with the House over the defense budget.   At the start of Senate debate, Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., a memberof the Armed Services Committee, proclaimed that the ``uncheckeddefense budget is history.''   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., a member of the armed servicespanel, said that although Bush's budget is ``not ideal, itrepresents the best compromise given the budget problems in ournation.''   House debate got off to a rocky start as Republicans criticizeda decision by the Democratic-controlled Rules Committee to vote onthe fate of the V-22 Osprey and the F-14D Tomcat in a singleamendment.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in crafting a $295 billiondefense budget, has proposed eliminating the Marine Corps V-22, atilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but can flylike a plane, and the F-14D jet fighter.   After a few hours of behind-the-scenes wrangling, Rep. DavidBonior, D-Mich., a member of the Rules Committee, offered aprovision to allow the House to vote on separate amendments toeliminate money for the V-22 and F-14D. The procedural rule thenwas approved by voice vote.   Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on theHouse Armed Services Committee, plans to introduce an amendment toaccept Cheney's budget. Dickinson also had sought separateamendments on whether to fund the V-22 and F-14D.   But the Rules Committee had decided to combine the two in asingle amendment and the panel's minority members approved thedecision.   The House plan was to complete the defense bill by the end ofthe week. The House planned to take up Star Wars on Tuesday, thestealth bomber and ICBMs on Wednesday and other aspects of thedefense bill on Thursday.   The stealth bomber remained the most controversial and uncertainissue in the bill.   Reps. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, and Mike Synar, D-Okla., will introduce an amendment tofreeze funds for the bomber until Congress receives moreinformation. The bill also would include money for production ofonly two bombers in 1990 and 1991, when the administration wantseight bombers.   Another amendment by Reps. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., John Kasich,R-Ohio, and John Rowland, R-Conn., proposes stopping productionafter the 13 planes now in construction and mothballing the line.   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., will propose accepting the decision ofthe House Armed Services Committee, which cut $800 million from the$4.7 billion the Pentagon requested for the B-2 in the fiscal 1990budget.   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri toldreporters Monday that he didn't ``sense a Republican or Democraticposition on the B-2.''   On Star Wars, the House Armed Services Committee slashed $1.1billion from the Bush administration's request of $4.9 billion forwhat is formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.   A series of House amendments would eliminate all funds for theprogram, cut it to $1.3 billion, reduce it to $3.1 billion orincrease it to $4.1 billion.   Bush told lawmakers Monday: ``I strongly support what we sent upthere to the Hill. SDI, in my view, is critical.''</TEXT></DOC>
