Deborah Longueil, 23, was arrested Tuesday when she reported herson missing 26 hours after she let two strangers take care of theboy while she allegedly took drugs and worked as a prostitute.   The boy, who had been found by police at the bus terminal, wasplaced in city custody, and Ms. Longueil was arrested on a charge ofendangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor.   ``She said she wanted to see her baby,'' said Port Authoritypolice Sgt. Bernard Poggioli. ``When we told her she was beingarrested, she was shocked. Then the tears came.''   There was less shock in Brattleboro, Vt., where a relative saidMs. Longueil had grown up beset by problems _ difficult familyrelations, drugs and drinking, young motherhood, a couple of minorscrapes with the law.   ``She had petty larceny here. Alcohol is her biggest problem, anddrugs. She got into drugs quite a bit,'' said Frank Longueil, thewoman's uncle. ``It started way back when she was a kid; her fatherused to drink considerable. She and her mother didn't get along.Just one of those bad scenes.''   At the Brattleboro Police Department, ``We know who she is,''said Sgt. Steve Rowell. A warrant for her arrest has been pendingsince she failed to appear at a court hearing Dec. 27 on ashoplifting charge.   The charge is a minor one: Stealing two marble bookends and threeboxes of candles Nov. 12 from a stationery store in Brattleboro, amisdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $300 fine.   Vermont District Court records list a few earlier cases: a $15fine for shoplifting in 1982, probation for a burglary in 1983 and a$25 fine in 1983 for carrying an open beer. The father of Ms.Longueil's child has been in bigger trouble: Michael Young is instate prison in Vermont for a burglary conviction, authorities said.   Poggioli said Ms. Longueil once went through a drugrehabilitation program. Her father, Sheldon, who came to New York onTuesday night, told reporters: ``She needs drugs.''   She allegedly came to New York with her son, Adam, to flee thearrest warrant, staying in cheap hotels.   On Monday, Officer Bernard Frain saw the boy with two men in arestricted area of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. They told himthey were baby-sitting while his mother worked as a prostitute,police said.   The men did not know the woman's name or the boy's. Policearrested them on trespassing charges.   When Ms. Longueil appeared Tuesday at the police station toreport her son missing, she said she looked for her child all night,said Poggioli.   ``But she wasn't looking too hard. We have people on the streetwho say they saw her doing crack,'' he said.   Gerald McKelvey, spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney,said Ms. Longueil's arraignment was not scheduled as of Wednesdayafternoon. Fran Friedberg, a lawyer with the city's welfare office,said a hearing also had not been set on the Longueil family'srequest to gain custody of the child.</TEXT></DOC>
