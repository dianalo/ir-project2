When asked a question, people in the four groups will punch their replies into hand-held devices with microprocessors. In five seconds, their responses will be gathered and converted into charts and graphs.    Quickly, host Bryant Gumbel will know, say, how many respondents would be bothered by having a black boss. Not only that, Mr. Gumbel will be able to compare responses in Jackson, Miss., with those in Los Angeles, New York or Milwaukee. (Each audience is selected to be demographically representative of its city.) Or he can break down answers by sex, age group or political affiliation. If the show takes an unexpected turn, he can interject a new question. Viewers at home won't vote electronically, but they will be able to see how they compare with the studio audiences.    In the ratings wars, the networks are grabbing for any edge that pulls in viewers, and NBC is trying out an evolving interactive technology whose uses are still being invented. One of the companies furthest along with the technology is Quick Tally Systems, which is applying it to market research, corporate meetings and other fields. A Los Angeles television station, KCBS, used the company's hand-held devices last week to measure racial attitudes among a group of Los Angeles high school students of different races. MTV recently employed Quick Tally in &quot;MTV's Big (Blank) Show,&quot; in which a studio audience decided by vote whether certain segments would be a comedian, music video or other selection. But NBC's show, to appear Sept. 5 and 6, will be the first use of Quick Tally to gather data from more than one location, and the company is still working frantically to get all the technology to mesh.    Satellite technology can already assemble a handful of individuals from around the globe to argue an issue on shows such as ABC's &quot;Nightline.&quot; But Eli Bleich, the former television producer and political media consultant who founded Quick Tally, is trying to allow a much larger group of scattered people to register their opinions collectively and quickly, making for unpredictable, highly topical television.    &quot;You get an instant snapshot of a group's opinions, but it can also turn into a conversation,&quot; says Mr. Bleich. &quot;If the responses are really unexpected, the host can say, 'Are you meaning this the way I take it? What if you were in this situation, what would you do?'&quot; A person operating a laptop computer during the session can instantly program in a new question and set it up for graphics.    &quot;We've never tried anything quite like this before, and either it'll work or it won't,&quot; says Paul Greenberg, the show's co-producer at NBC with Mr. Gumbel. NBC also took a national poll on racial attitudes to which it can compare the live results, and if the hardware doesn't work NBC can rely on the other poll.    To make the quiz more visual, NBC will show video segments of everyday situations that have racial aspects. Members of the four studio audiences will slide a knob on the side of their handsets -- up if they like what they see, down if they don't. As the short video is replayed, viewers at home will see a graph superimposed on the screen showing what images turned people off or on. &quot;If this is successful, it may produce very useful serious research,&quot; Mr. Greenberg says. &quot;If it works on the level of good television, we'll probably try other things.&quot;    ABC, meanwhile, will broadcast its own documentary on race tomorrow night, called &quot;Black in White America.&quot; Ray Nunn, executive producer of the ABC show, says of the Quick Tally technology, &quot;I wouldn't want to dismiss it out of hand&quot; and adds that he is &quot;intrigued by the possibilities.&quot;    To complaints that NBC's electronic quiz is a gimmick that turns the program into a game show, Mr. Bleich of Quick Tally responds: &quot;The game-show aspect isn't necessarily bad, if it gets people at home actively involved,&quot; he says. &quot;Public affairs shows just don't attract the audience of 'Miami Vice,' but if there are techniques that work from other genres, why not use them?&quot;    Erik Sorenson, general manager of KCBS, says, &quot;I don't think this technology has unlimited application on television, but with the right format, it's great. Our show with black, white, Latino and Oriental kids on racism would have been great anyway, but the technology makes it 30% better. If somebody says, 'There's more racism now than 10 years ago,' you might hear cheering in the studio audience, but how do you know that it isn't a vocal minority?&quot;    Mr. Sorenson says he thinks the technology can help ratings. For example, 5% of Los Angeles TV households tuned into the KCBS show on racism, a much better rating than most public-affairs shows. Quick Tally has been developing the technology for more than a decade. In the late '70s, Mr. Bleich's political consulting firm ran seven televised &quot;town meetings&quot; in Alaska at which hundreds of locals voted on how they wanted the state's oil revenue to be spent. The company has begun marketing the technology to ad agencies, Hollywood studios and the TV networks to help track audience reactions to new commercials and television series. The company is still losing money from development costs, and the technology's potential has increased the number of competitors.    In the future, classrooms may use the hand-held devices, says Mr. Bleich: &quot;A teacher can conduct a quick oral quiz, and if the kids do badly, can review the material again.&quot; Assuming that the NBC experiment of multiple sites proceeds smoothly, Quick Tally will apply the technology to corporate teleconferences. The next breakthrough: devices that will poll home viewers, too. </TEXT></DOC>
