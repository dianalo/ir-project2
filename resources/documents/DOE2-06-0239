Today'sknowledge suggests the enhanced exploitation of solar energy, nuclearfusion and the application of uranium in sodium-cooled breeder reactorsas the alternative energies offering a great potential. The sodium-cooledreactor outdistances the other options in terms of development. Its technicalfeasibility and safe operation have been verified and its profitabilityappears to be possible when using today's technology. The verificationof its profitability while maintaining a high safety level is the overridingtask for the future. The paper discusses corresponding activities inthe USA, the USSR, Japan and Western Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
