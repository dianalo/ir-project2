Given current technological developments andthose anticipated in the near future, he notes that solar energy cannotbe regarded as an effective substitute energy for the industrializednations of the western world, even though it does represent a supplementaryform of energy that can - and should - be taken seriously and exploitedwherever practicable. Finally, he is convinced that for alternative energysources to make a genuine contribution, they must be integrated intothe existing and reliable energy system, of which nuclear power and fossilfuels are an essential part.</TEXT></DOC>
