This is a continuouslyoperating, fluidized bed process which utilizes iron ore fines, naturalgas, electricity and raw water to produce pillow shaped DRI briquetteswhich exhibit a high level of metallization, uniform chemical composition,superior safety characteristics during transportation and storage, andsuperior physical strength. The first and only commercial FIOR plantcurrently consumes natural gas at the rate of approximately 7.35 trillionBtu's per year while producing 350,000 metric tons per year of briquettedproduct. The operation of this plant has proven to be a successful, costeffective means of adding significant value to local raw materials -iron ore fines and natural gas. This paper serves two primary objectives.The first is to describe the process as designed and operated in theexisting plant with emphasis on current natural gas consumption. Thesecond objective is to examine potential enhancements to a second generationFIOR plant design in terms of improved efficiencies of natural gas consumption.</TEXT></DOC>
