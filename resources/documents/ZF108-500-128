(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Micro-Z bills its $49.50 Direc-Tree Plus DOS shell as &quot;the perfect companionfor your hard disk.&quot; This company has had a shell program on the marketlonger than almost any other in this roundup, and comes very close todelivering what it boasts.andM;Now in Version 5.4, Direc-Tree supplies an excellent installation programthat lets you use the shell immediately or customize it to yourspecifications first.andP;  Installation is marred only by the inability to supplyan alternative directory to DirecTree's default directory.andP;  Nevertheless,once your installation is complete, you can copy the Direc-Tree files to anydirectory you choose.andM;The program is accompanied by thorough, straightforward documentation, aswell as by context-sensitive help screens that guide you through Direc-Tree'sfile-management procedures.andP;  When you first boot the program, eight lines atthe bottom of your screen are covered by a pop-up help window that listsDirec-Tree's basic keystroke commands.andP;  As you use the cursor keys to movethe highlight bar from directory to directory, the pop-up window shiftsposition to give you the most advantageous view of the directory tree.andP;  Youcan toggle the help window off if you wish.andM;Like the other DOS shells evaluated here, Direc-Tree performs a variety ofDOS functions via easy keystroke combinations.andP;  You can change directories bychoosing a graphical representation from your disk's directory tree; you canview files in hex or ASCII formats; sort, move, rename, delete, and copyfiles, file groups, subdirectories, and whole directories.andM;Direc-Tree's keystroke combinations are user-definable, and you can programup to 100 macros accessible from a user-programmable &quot;Preset Menu&quot; thatenables you to perform complex DOS operations or run programs.andP;  You can alsoshell out to DOS or applications.andM;Direc-Tree provides a facility to attach notes-up to 60 characters-to each ofyour DOS files.andP;  A pop-up status screen gives you the amount of file spaceleft on your hard disk, the amount of free system RAM, and the time and date.andO;LEAVING OTHERS BEHIND Where standard DOS-shell features stop, Direc-Treetruly starts to shine.andP;  The entire program takes only about 35K RAM, and youcan configure Direc-Tree to unload most of itself from memory-all but about5K-when you shell out to your word processor, database, communicationspackage, DOS prompt, or any other application.andP;  I loaded and unloaded DBASE[V (a notorious memory hog) without a blip, and ran my word processor fromDirec-Tree with Lotus Express chugging away in background mode.andP;  Direc-Treeallowed me to manage my files with system memory to spare.andP;  This excellent,well-designed memory management scheme, if nothing else, puts Direc-Treeamong the leaders for true ease of use.andM;But why stop there? Suppose you don't want to wait for your word processor toload; Direc-Tree includes its own Word-Star-compatible editor.andP;  While thearchaic WordStar mnemonic commands take time to remember, the word processormade short work of editing simple ASCII files-CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC BAT, andthe like.andM;Yet another excellent feature is DirecTree's Securi-Tree, a program thatworks within Direc-Tree and allows you to secure individual or groups ofdirectories.andP;  Once a directory is secure, it cannot be accessed without theproper password.andP;  Up to 12 different directory groups can be secured and thensupervised by a manager with access to all of them.andM;Is Direc-Tree really perfect? Not quite.andP;  The program does include driversfor PCMouse, Microsoft, Logitech, and Genius mice, but you won't find anymention of them in the documentation.andP;  Instead, you'll have to follow theinstructions for their installation in an assortment of README .DOC fileslocated on the distribution disk.andP;  And while easier mouse compatibility wouldadd even greater convenience to this versatile, application-friendly DOSshell, it's still a front-runner for power users who need memory andflexibility.andP;  Direc-Tree Plus, Version 5.4 Micro-Z Co., 4 Santa Bella Rd.,andO;Rolling Hills, CA 90274; (213) 377-1640.andP;  List Price: $49.50.andP;  Requires: 64KRAM, DOS 2.0 or later.andP;  In Short: A DOS shell with all the right stuff,Direc-Tree gives you not only a full complement of DOS-prompt-bashing macros,but superior memory handling, its own text editor, and a solid securityscheme as well.andP;  It makes DOS easy for beginners and experts alike.andP;  *andO;</TEXT></DOC>
