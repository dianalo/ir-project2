Stephen Solarz portentously to the TV cameras outside the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, &quot;that the higher authority&quot; for Lt. Col. Oliver North's pro-contra activities &quot;was probably, indeed almost certainly, the president of the United States himself.&quot;    There it was. By the end of Congress's first week at center stage in the Iran-contra scandal, the critics had found their voice. &quot;No one wants another Watergate,&quot; they crooned reassuringly at the beginning. Most probably meant it. But some of them -- along with their attendant journalists -- are now marching around Washington sounding like creatures out of &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers,&quot; programmed to speak nothing but Watergate words and think none but Watergate thoughts.    Last week, the Select Senate Committee on Intelligence took testimony in its supersecret, soundproof, bugproof bank vault of a room and promptly leaked to the press. The leaks from various committees have continued this week in the great Watergate tradition.    Moreover, this week the House Foreign Affairs Committee, that zoo over which Rep. Dante Fascell bravely tries to preside, opened televised hearings.    Secretary of State George Shultz and ex-national security adviser Robert McFarlane warmed up the house, but everyone was waiting for Vice Adm. John Poindexter, the ex-national security adviser, and Col. North. These military men, pledged to the preservation of order, were going to have to take refuge in their Fifth Amendment rights. The proceedings would finally generate some of the electricity of a criminal trial.    They did. First came Col. North looking like a hero out of Central Casting, from his beribboned chest to his Boy Scout face. Television, powerful tool of modern investigators, turned the tables this time. If the committee had polled its TV audience on what to do if Col. North turned out to be a lawbreaker, 80% would have voted to throw the offending law out the window.    Adm. Poindexter was not so visually winning but had a street fighter of an attorney next to him at the witness table. In a news-making exchange, Rep. Michael Barnes wondered with true Watergate animus whether Adm. Poindexter really needed to take the Fifth and deprive the country of its rightful knowledge about the contra deal. &quot;The worst thing that could happen to you,&quot; said Mr. Barnes reassuringly, is that &quot;you would have a very short, probably suspended sentence somewhere.&quot;    Mr. Poindexter's attorney immediately yelled bloody murder -- and the audience applauded his protest. Rep. Barnes beat a retreat.    But the question showed the problem with the Iran-contra investigation, which is that the bulk of investigators' efforts and public attention are starting to go to questions of criminality, illegality, procedural irregularity and illegitimate secrecy.    The viewers gazing at Ollie North, the people clapping for Mr. Poindexter's lawyer, and the majority of the congressmen who keep tabs on such signs and portents do not want these men pursued like criminals who shield a lying president. But 10 years ago Washington developed a set of techniques and principles for dealing with major imbroglios. &quot;What did the president know and when did he know it?&quot; &quot;Follow the money!&quot; Concurrent investigations. Special prosecutor. Televised hearings. People are following the pattern like zombies, though it is atrociously unsuited to the crisis that the Iran-contra incident has illuminated.    So far, the problem with the venture does not seem to be criminality. (Notice the &quot;so far.&quot; Notice the &quot;seem.&quot; They are examples of the Watergate Disclaimer, a standard device since the discovery of the 18-minute gap.) A mishmash of three-dozen interlocking laws -- each one dense, verbose and ambiguous -- is applicable to Col. North's arms transfers. They are nearly unintelligible. No one can possibly have understood them well enough to violate them with any true criminal intent.    Instead, the big problem is that some decisions in the affair were made without even elementary political prudence. To a certain extent this failure came about because government organizations from Congress to the State Department had been cut out of the loop.    This sort of exclusion has become a standard feature of the way presidents make foreign policy. The reason is that presidents fear, often with justification, that every piece of information escaping their inner circle will be used by opponents to obstruct presidential policy.    This problem is doing us massive damage in the world. The story of how it came to be holds enough blame for everyone. It cannot be fixed by more rules and punishments to force presidents into closer communication with the bureaucracy or Congress. High federal officials are already doing less of their business on paper and more of it huddled in corners at cocktail parties. More rules will not work. Everybody knows it.    But some players in this game will do anything to avoid looking into the mirror of accountability. They insist on pointing the finger ever outward. Thus we have Mike Barnes, who has done so much to turn foreign-policy making into a legal minefield, peering down sanctimoniously at John Poindexter and asking why the gentleman could possibly want to take the Fifth.    This is one hell of a nerve, but it is not an isolated offense. The pursuers' inability to break out of this obsessive and clearly inappropriate pattern of behavior is sick. It is also saddening to watch, frightening, and very boring. Worst of all, in Washington these days it is hard to flip the dial to a different channel. </TEXT></DOC>
