Poland's still unrevised constitution entitles thepresident to ask any individual he wants to attempt to form agovernment, not necessarily a member of the leading party.Judging by forecasts based on exit polls in the country'sfirst free vote for a national legislature in over 50 years,President Walesa will have his fill of possible choices.</LP><TEXT>   Six parties that trace their roots to the Solidaritymovement, but today differ on many issues, appear to have wonabout 45% of the vote. That would translate into 225 seats,just short of a majority in parliament's 460-seat lowerhouse.   The Democratic Union, led by former Prime Minister TadeuszMazowiecki, was the front-runner, but with just 76 seats. TheCenter Alliance and a farmers' coalition gained 50 and 19seats, respectively, while the Liberal Democrats took 39seats and the Solidarity Trade Union 28, according to thepredictions. Another small party, Labor Solidarity,apparently won 2.3%, or 13 seats.   Voter turnout figures weren't immediately available, butpre-election surveys said it would be low, a sign ofconfusion over so many parties and apathy in a dismaleconomic climate. Nearly 250 parties vied for 460 seats inthe parliament's lower house and 100 seats in the Senate.   If there was one decisive result, it was that theCommunists of the old regime are finally off center stage,though they still have a presence in the political wings.Their combined parties took an estimated 19% of the vote, for100 seats. Since the election of June 1989, when Solidarityrouted them from power, an anachronistic deal had allowedthem to retain 65% of the seats in parliament.   Parties endorsed by the Roman Catholic Church fared worsethan expected. A showing of 13.3% in the exit polls gave thechurch 61 seats and dented its image as a political force.   Despite the overall fuzzy outcome, Mr. Walesa may have achance to mold a more coherent majority government than theconfusion suggests. Voters may have had troubledistinguishing between the leading parties because theirroots all lie in the Solidarity movement that toppledcommunism here. All essentially agree that Poland needs amarket democracy as quickly as can be.   Still, putting together such a coalition won't be easy andcould take weeks. Personal rivalries split Solidarity'sfactions. So do complex disagreements over the best route tothe market without adding to social dissatisfaction.   The Democratic Union, which among other things wants tofight inflation and cut taxes for state companies, is at oddswith the free-market Liberals whose leader, Jan KrzysztofBielicki, is the current prime minister.   The Center Alliance, advocating a clean-out ofex-communists from government and industry, vows it won'tgovern with the Democratic Union, which is dead set againstwitch hunts. And the Democratic Union could itself face asplit between its own left and right wings.   Meanwhile, leaders of the Solidarity Trade Union simplyinsist they won't participate in government.</TEXT></DOC>
