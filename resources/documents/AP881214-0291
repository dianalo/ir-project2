Imports jumped 14.1 percent to an average 7.95 million barrels aday from 6.97 million barrels in November 1987, with imports ofgasoline and other refined products reaching their highest levelsince 1974, according to API's Monthly Statistical Report.   Daily domestic crude oil production fell 4.3 percent _ thebiggest decline this year _ to an average of 8.04 million barrels aday, due mainly to a slowdown in output in the lower 48 states.Alaska production remained steady at around 2 million barrels a day,the report said.   Analysts said strong demand in November continued to consume thegrowing imports as total supplies of crude oil and refined productsdeclined 3.6 percent compared with the same time last year.   The institute said lower world crude prices helped boost importsfor the first 11 months of 1988 to their highest level since 1980 asthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries continued itsrunaway production.   However, OPEC members agreed last month to lower cartelproduction in the first six months of 1989. World crude prices havefirmed slightly since the accord in anticipation of a cutback.   In November, crude oil imports averaged 5.3 million barrels aday, up 7.8 percent from November 1987, the report said.   Product imports rose 29 percent to an average 2.7 million barrelsa day. Daily gasoline imports reached a new high of 630,000 barrelsfor the month, up 80,000 barrels a day from a year ago. Distillateand residual fuel oil imports also were strong.   In the past three years, daily imports are up by 2.2 millionbarrels, with increasing demand accounting for about two-thirds ofthe increase and declining domestic production accounting for mostof the remainder, the API said.   But despite high imports, total inventories fell by 5 millionbarrels in November. API said inventories have fallen about 18million barrels since July, or more than 50 million barrels afteraccounting for seasonal factors.   Combined deliveries surged more than 1.3 million barrels a day,an 8.1 percent increase from the year-ago period.   Gasoline deliveries rose 3.6 percent, or nearly 5 millionbarrels, even as motorists began cutting back on travel. Gasolineproduction rose 1.5 percent while gasoline stocks declined 6 millionbarrels from last November.   Distillate deliveries rose 7.3 percent despite continued mildweather. Analysts said the rise probably reflected investors takingadvantage of weak prices.   The report also said utilization of the nation's refineriesincreased to 83.2 percent from 82.3 percent last November.</TEXT></DOC>
