Twenty-eight men slept in a tent Tuesday night, after theImmigration and Naturalization Service ran out of bed space for maledetainees in buildings at the minimum-security center here, INSspokeswoman Virginia Kice said.   ``This is the first time the tents have been deployed,'' Ms. Kicesaid. ``We've reached our capacity.''   The INS, faced with a flood of Central Americans it maintains arefiling ``frivolous'' applications for political asylum afterillegally crossing the Rio Grande into southern Texas, has begun atwo-pronged get-tough effort.   On Feb. 21, the agency began immediate arrest and detention ofasylum-seekers whose cases are denied. At the same time, it addedmore than 100 new Border Patrol agents to police the border.   Asylum applicants previously were allowed to travel to their U.S.destinations after checking in with the INS in southern Texas. TheINS office in Miami reported this week that half of the applicantsfail to show up for interviews there.   Of the first 352 applications for asylum in southern Texas underthe week-old procedure, the INS granted asylum in just 10 cases, allNicaraguans. It denied 319 and issued ``intents to deny'' for theremaining 23. An intent-to-deny notice means applicants have 15 daysto present documentation to bolster borderline cases.   Political asylum is granted to those fleeing persecution. The INScontends that most of the Central Americans seeking asylum are herefor economic reasons and do not qualify for political refugee status.   Although the number of applicants for asylum has dwindled underthe new policy, Central Americans are still trying to cross the RioGrande, authorities say.   ``They're still coming across,'' Border Patrol intelligence agentFred Rangel said in a telephone interview from McAllen. ``We'repretty well swamped. There's no doubt about it.''   On Tuesday, Border Patrol agents apprehended 249 non-Mexicanundocumented aliens and encountered one man who fired several shotsinto a Border Patrol vehicle. The man escaped by jumping back intothe Rio Grande, Rangel said.   The INS says it could house as many as 5,000 adults in tents atits Port Isabel Service Processing Center, the lockup near Bayview,about 20 miles northeast of the border city of Brownsville. Sevenlarge, brightly colored, striped tents so far have been erected atthe detention center.   And 27 more illegal immigrants were being taken to the detentioncenter Wednesday after being arrested on an airplane in Charlotte,N.C. Officials there said the aliens, arrested aboard a PiedmontAirlines flight from Phoenix, had been put on a bus to theimmigration center near Brownsville.   The total number of detainees hat Bayview on Wednesday was 1,011,697 men and 314 women, including the 28 men in the tents. Some spaceremained available in the women's fixed dormitory area, Ms. Kicesaid.   Family groups are sent to an American Red Cross shelter inBrownsville, where 711 slept Tuesday night, double the number therea month ago. The shelter's capacity is 800.</TEXT></DOC>
