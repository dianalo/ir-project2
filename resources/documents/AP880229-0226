The official said that penalties to be announced on Tuesday havealready been applied against Panama and thus will have noadditional impact on that country.   A 1986 U.S. law decreed that countries which do not take stepsto halt drug trafficking to the United States are no longereligible for U.S. aid and are not entitled to U.S. support fortheir assistance requests to international lending institutions.   Tuesday is the deadline for certifying that foreign countrieshave complied in combating drug trafficking. Countries which are``decertified'' are subject to the penalties.   The source, who asked not to be identified, noted that U.S.economic and military aid to Panama was cut off last year and thatthe United States has not backed Panama's requests in the lendinginstitutions because its repayments are in arrears.   The institutions involved are the World Bank, the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the officialsaid.   Under Reagan's finding, Mexico was ``certified'' as cooperatingin drug enforcement efforts, the official said. CBS News and TheWashington Post reported that Colombia was also likely to becertified as cooperating in drug enforcement efforts.   The official said government lawyers are studying thepossibility of excluding Panamanian participation from a system oftariff preferences the United States accords to most Third Worldcountries.   In addition, the lawyers are reviewing Panamanian membership inthe Caribbean Basin Initiative, under which nations from thatregion are given duty-free access on most products to U.S. markets.   According to the official, Panama's record on drug enforcementmay be such that it cannot legally participate in either programbased on membership requirements.   On Feb. 5, Panama's military strong man, Manuel Antonio Noriega,was indicted by two federal grand juries on charges that he is amajor figure in an international drug smuggling conspiracy.   Colombian drug traffickers were alleged to have paid Noriegamore than $5 million in return for permission to use Panamanianairstrips to fly cocaine to the United States.   The sanctions decision comes at a time when the administrationis seeking to force Noriega out as commander of Panama's DefenseForces, in which he has dominated Panama's political life.   Late last week, Noriega ignored an order by President EricArturo Delvalle that he step down as defense chief and movedquickly to depose Devalle with the help of allies in the NationalAssembly.   Delvalle, calling his ouster illegal, has said he stillconsiders himself Panama's president, a position supported by theReagan administration.   Meanwhile, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a leader of theanti-Noriega forces in Congress, introduced a resolution asking theReagan administration to consider imposing economic sanctionsagainst Panama, including a trade embargo. An official said theadministraion is not contemplating any such action.   The resolution also asks that the United States cut off allcontacts with Noriega because he is ``no longer the lawfulcommander'' of the Defense Forces.   In a brief speech on the Senate floor, Kennedy said that Noriega``is a threat to peace and security in the region.''   ``When a drug trafficker gets control over the governmentalpowers of a nation, it's a threat to other nations,'' Kennedy said.</TEXT></DOC>
