The pact was a necessary step to integrate the two groups into the merged operation.    Delta, which acquired Western Airlines April 1, said the pilots' agreement will allow the company to proceed with its plans and marketing strategy for the merged company.    Separately, Delta said it flew 3.86 billion revenue passenger miles in May, up 48.7% from 2.60 billion last year.    A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile. The carrier also said its load factor, or percentage of seats filled, fell in May to 55.3% from 57.3% last year. Figures for the latest period include Western Airlines, Delta said.    Revenue passenger miles for the first five months of the year rose 39.4% to 18.08 billion miles from 12.97 billion miles in the year-earlier period, the company said. The load factor for the latest five months dropped to 54.3% from 59.4%. </TEXT></DOC>
