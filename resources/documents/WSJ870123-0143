Year-Ago Loss---By Mark RussellStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AAEARNINGS (ERN)MINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN) </IN><DATELINE> PITTSBURGH  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Aluminum Co. of America, benefiting from a hefty gain on the sale of real-estate investments, posted fourth-quarter net income of $165.3 million, or $1.93 a share, compared with a net loss of $120.9 million a year earlier.    The nation's top aluminum producer posted operating profit of $27.1 million, compared with operating profit of $23.7 million in 1985's fourth quarter. The net and operating results were generally in line with securities analysts' expectations.    The latest quarter's results included a net gain of $138.2 million, or $1.63 a share, from several one-time gains and losses. These included gains of $198.2 million from the sale of real-estate investments and $12.7 million from reorganizing its Alcoa of Great Britain unit, as well as charges totaling $72.7 million, mainly from plant closings and consolidations.    The prior year's quarter included charges totaling $144.6 million, mainly from plant closings and write-downs.    Fourth-quarter revenue dropped slightly to $1.16 billion from $1.21 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Aluminum shipments declined to 364,000 tons from 418,000 tons.    &quot;We moved further into our restructuring program in 1986 with asset sales and facility write-offs,&quot; said Charles W. Parry, Alcoa's chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Parry also cited greater work-rule flexibility negotiated last year in Alcoa's labor agreement with hourly workers, and improved manufacturing technologies.    Mr. Parry said Alcoa's shipments declined partly because of a five-week strike at its U.S. plants last year and a strike at some of its major can-sheet customers, also last year. He added that 1986 prices on many products fell from the prior year's, including prices for Alcoa's largest volume product, rigid container sheet for beverage cans. &quot;In spite of disruptions from the strike and low prices, our operating margins improved for 1986,&quot; Mr. Parry noted.    Alcoa posted fourth-quarter foreign currency exchange losses of $16.7 million, compared with foreign currency exchange gains of $10.5 million in the year-earlier period.    For all of 1986, Alcoa posted net income of $254.1 million, or $2.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $16.6 million in 1985. Revenue for the year dropped to $4.67 billion from $5.16 billion in 1985.    Alcoa posted 1986 operating profit of $125.8 million, compared with $140.3 million in 1985. The 1986 results included a net gain of $138.2 million and an extraordinary charge of $9.9 million from the early redemption of debentures. The 1985 figures included charges totaling $156.9 million, mainly from plant closings and write-downs.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Alcoa shares closed at $39.375, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
