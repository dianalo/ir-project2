A preview of the luxury items that supplied an exclusive diningclub set up by the bank's ex-chairman, David Paul, was held atCenTrust in Miami Tuesday. The whole batch goes up for saleSaturday as federal regulators try to recover at least part of the$2 billion cost of bailing out the thrift _ the state's largestsavings and loan until it was seized in February.   Regulators charge Paul with using the failed thrift as his``personal piggy bank.''   The items for sale include small silver tongs for french friesand large silver tongs for ice cubes, a flat-slotted spoon forserving aspargus and a racked pan for holding asparagus.   Silver-plated grape scissors, bone holders, lemon squeezers andpate spreaders are among the odder implements for sale.   ``It's a bit much,'' said Eleanor Matthews, a contractadministrator for Florida's Dade County. ``I have to say I neverknew there were silver holders for paper plates and cups before.''   Gold-rimmed, five-piece Limoges china settings sell for $600 andeach piece of crystal sells for $140, but no minumum prices havebeen set for most of the items at the auction.
