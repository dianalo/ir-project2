The aim is toprovide an objective and accurate picture of what we know and don't knowtoday about carbon dioxide and its effects on climate. The document showsmeasurements reflecting changes in atmospheric CO{sub 2} concentrationsover the last two centuries. Because the atmosphere is relatively efficientat mixing carbon dioxide, the graph reflects global, not local, changes.Much of the 25% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrationcan be attributed to the accelerated burning of fossil fuels followingthe industrial revolution. We can measure quite accurately the continuingincreases in carbon dioxide. The question is, how will this affect climate?The document contains viewgraphs of the figures. 6 refs., 22 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
