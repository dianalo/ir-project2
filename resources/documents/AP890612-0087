RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, in a case involving skiequipment rentals, ruled today that state taxes may be imposed whenbankrupt companies sell their assets.   By a 6-3 vote, the justices said the taxes may be imposed on suchsales and on a buyer's subsequent use of the assets when bankruptcompanies are ordered to liquidate.   The court allowed California officials to tax the rental of skisby a ski resort that acquired the equipment from a bankrupt company.   Nothing in the Constitution or federal law forbids such statetaxes, said Justice John Paul Stevens for the court.   He said a doctrine that bars states from imposing taxes on thefederal government does not extend to private companies inbankruptcy proceedings. Such proceedings are overseen by federaljudges who appoint officials to dispose of the assets.   States may tax private parties with whom the federal governmentdoes business even if a financial burden falls on the government,Stevens said.   ``Whatever immunity the bankrupt estate once enjoyed fromtaxation on its operations has long since eroded and there is now noconstitutional impediment to the imposition of a sales tax or usetax on a liquidation sale,'' he said.   Dissenting were Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennanand Thurgood Marshall.   The ruling is a defeat for Sierra Summit and the ski resort'sparent corporation, Snow Summit Ski Corp.   The corporation acquired the assets of China Peak Resort for $3.5million after China Peak declared bankruptcy in 1981. The assetsincluded skis to be used for renting to customers.   The California State Board of Equalization sought to assess$55,000 in taxes on the sale of the assets. But a federal bankruptcyjudge in 1983 barred the tax on grounds the assets transferred froma bankrupt company are exempt.   The state board took another approach in 1985, seeing to impose ause tax on income of $196,518 that Sierra Summit received fromrenting the skis acquired from China Peak.   Under California law, if Sierra Summit had paid either sales oruse tax on its purchase of the skis, the rental income would not betaxable.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals barred the taxes.   The case is California vs. Sierra Summit, 88-681.</TEXT></DOC>
