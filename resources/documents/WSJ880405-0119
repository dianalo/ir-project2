But he was left barefoot at the airport.    A woman returned from Italy with a $14,000 leather and jaguar coat. When she arrived in San Francisco, however, government agents seized her new coat and stripped the fur from it.    &quot;We don't make many friends,&quot; says David Klinger, spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, an agency of the Interior Department. Working with the World Wildlife Fund, the department has recently stepped up efforts to educate tourists and confiscate souvenirs made from endangered species.    The World Wildlife Fund estimates that illegal wildlife trade has increased to as much as $250 million annually, from about $200 million, in less than five years. Such trade now ranks second only to drug trafficking among goods smuggled into the U.S., officials say. The problem reflects a rise in the number of Americans traveling to locations such as the Orient, South America and Africa. They go with more money to spend and a passion for ever more exotic gifts.    &quot;We've been successful in catching the professional smugglers,&quot; says Mr. Klinger, &quot;but stopping the collective amount citizens bring back could have as much of an effect as stopping the big smugglers.&quot;    Many of the goods seized are legally purchased by tourists, often in state-run stores, hotels or airport gift shops. Agents in San Francisco once seized a sea turtle from then-President Jimmy Carter. (It was an unsolicited gift.) Unsuspecting tourists &quot;have to surrender (the goods) to the possession of the U.S. government,&quot; says Mr. Klinger. &quot;When somebody's just shelled out a couple thousand dollars for a fur&quot; and loses it without compensation, &quot;it spoils a lot of vacations.&quot;    Jane Dore and her husband purchased the boots and a belt, which were made of sea turtle, at a large leather-goods store in Mexico City about two years ago, paying a total of about $150. When customs officials demanded they turn over the items, &quot;we thought, 'what is this, robbery?'&quot; she says. &quot;They acted like, 'It's none of your business. You're wrong. You're a criminal. You're lucky we're letting you back into the country.'&quot;    Mrs. Dore is angry she wasn't made aware of the restrictions before she left. &quot;They sell this stuff openly all over the world,&quot; she says. &quot;The people who sell it know what's going on. Their government allows it to go on.&quot; The Interior Department and the World Wildlife Fund have recently printed a brochure explaining what things shouldn't be purchased, and why. The brochures are available at airports and from travel agencies, as well as the department and the Wildlife Fund.    In New York, Robert Onda, supervisory inspector for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department, says, &quot;We've had people tell us when they went into the shop to purchase a crocodile handbag, they were told it's no problem to bring it back to the U.S. (The salespeople) must have had a nice laugh when they left.&quot;    Not surprisingly, tourists are angry with agents. One traveler returned from Paris with a $2,500 bag that was seized. &quot;They think: 'You're taking it from me, and your wife is going to get it,'&quot; Mr. Onda says. One disgruntled tourist smashed a turtle shell into pieces rather than surrender it undamaged.    Some of the goods are donated to schools, museums or zoos, but many just sit in storage. When space runs short, many of the exotic goods are burned because officials believe reselling them would only stimulate the market.    Items seized range from spotted cat coats costing $10,000 to a stuffed crocodile holding a banjo. Mr. Onda says many tourists don't understand why they can't keep their items, since the animal used in their product is already dead. &quot;But if everybody thought like that, there would be no wildlife,&quot; he says.    Typically, travelers are required only to forfeit the illegal items, unless there's evidence they tried to conceal them. In such cases, the travelers could be prosecuted. John Mendoza, a San Francisco inspector, says agents can often tell whether a person has made an innocent mistake &quot;if they get upset and stay upset.&quot;    In an office near the San Francisco airport, Inspector Kenneth McCloud shows some confiscated loot. There's an ocelot coat decorated with sequins, caiman skin boots, and python purses. Boa constrictor skin is very popular, he says, as are the feathers, talons, and beaks of eagles. He shows a tusk from a narwhal, worth $20,000, and a coat made of Asian leopard cat. &quot;One coat is 35 cats,&quot; he says.    Some items are just strange, such as stuffed Mexican lizards, the head of salt water crocodile from Bankok, Thailand, and a guitar made from a sea turtle shell. He shows a foot stool made from an elephant's leg and sperm whale teeth worth a couple hundred dollars each.    &quot;It's a huge market,&quot; he says. &quot;It's depressing to see how huge. Affluent people keep poachers in business.&quot;    The damage done by such poachers can be irreparable. &quot;People destroy coral reefs that take thousands of years to build, affecting all the fish that use it for food and shelter, just for a piece of decoration,&quot; says Mr. McCloud. The World Wildlife Fund estimates, for example, about 70% of the coral reefs in the Philippines have been damaged, because of dynamiting and other techniques used for collection.    (Mr. McCloud is proud of one small victory: When agents seized sea turtle eggs sold in a Central American marketplace, Mr. McCloud and his wife kept them warm; nine out of 11 hatched. The turtles were returned and released in their native Costa Rica.)    The World Wildlife Fund is trying to attack the problem at its source, by working with developing countries to control the poaching and set up wildlife management programs. As for the U.S., which is the world's largest importer of wildlife products, agents hope to persuade tourists to lose their taste for exotic trinkets.    Mrs. Dore, for example, remains &quot;bitter&quot; about the way agents seized the goods her family bought in Mexico but concedes the experience &quot;has made me more aware of endangered species.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
