But Mitsui executives said the move didn't necessarily mean the company was withdrawing from the petrochemical complex project at Bandar Khomeini in southern Iran. Work on the project, which is mostly complete, began in 1973 but has been virtually suspended since the Iran-Iraq war broke out seven years ago.    The investment company set up for the project by Mitsui and four affiliates, Iran Chemical Development Co., filed a notice of insured risk on Wednesday with Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.    The filing, designed to retain the right to claim insurance on the project, came in advance of the expiration yesterday of a 15-year claim period on insurance that covers about $1.1 billion in capital investment and loans by Mitsui and its partners. It will allow the group to claim insurance for an additional 26 months, officials said.    Iran Chemical's president, Hiroshi Watada, said his executives hadn't been permitted to inspect the site for two years, but he noted there were reports the complex had been damaged by Iraqi air strikes. Mr. Watada is planning to visit Tehran next month for discussions with Iranian officials on whether the project should continue. </TEXT></DOC>
