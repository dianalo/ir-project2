I will haveimpressed upon my successor that we must carry on until it issigned.''   In addition to their walk through Red Square, the leaders alsostrolled through the Kremlin`s Cathedral Square, winning applausefrom several dozen onlookers. Like any politician, they waved tothe crowds. Moving along with the leaders was a remarkable swarm ofsecurity agents.   The square had been cleared of people except for hundredsstanding in a single file to view Lenin's tomb and eight groups ofabout 25 each stationed in the area of St. Basil's Cathedral.   The surprise visit to Red Square threw the official summitschedule out of whack. Reagan told one cluster of people that,``What we have decided to do is talk to each other rather thanabout each other and it's working just fine.''   Playing the part of tour guide, Gorbachev pointed out landmarksin the historic square and joked, ``There be no perestroika .. norebuilding here.''   Reagan and Gorbachev approached each of the groups, andGorbachev introduced the president at each stop. The crowdsapplauded warmly.   Gorbachev told one group, ``When we meet, the president and Italk and he sometimes has criticisms about the Soviet Union. I dothe same about America. But I see that some of this is amisconception about each other.''   Shultz and Shevardnadze also signed an agreement providing forjoint tests this summer in Nevada and at Semipalatinsk of U.S. andSoviet devices to measure the force of blasts.   Another agreement, extending for three years and expandingU.S.-Soviet cultural exchanges, was signed by Charles Z. Wick, thedirector of the U.S. Information Agency, and by Soviet CultureMinister Vasuky Zamharov.   Gorbachev told reporters at a Kremlin signing ceremony that hismorning one-on-one meeting with Reagan dwelled on economicquestions.   ``I criticized the position of the president and the Congresswhich has put very many roadblocks on the path of development ofhealthy economic cooperation,'' the Soviet leader said. ``Thepresident considers that we need to move more actively to improvethis.''   Mrs. Reagan broke away from the presidential party and flew toLeningrad, where she viewed the treasures of the Hermitage Museum,housing 65,000 pieces of art, and visited the summer palace ofPeter the Great, scene of revolutionary Soviet history.   Halfway through their four-day meeting, Reagan and Gorbachevseemed at ease with each other. They chatted and laughed togetherMonday night at a state dinner in the Kremlin's frescoed andicon-covered Hall of Facets despite lingering differences on humanrights, arms control and other issues.   Nevertheless, Gorbachev told Reagan they should conduct theirbusiness ``without interfering in domestic affairs, withoutsermonizing or imposing one's views and ways, without turningfamily or personal problems into a pretext for confrontationbetween states.''   Reagan said they should continue searching for common ground.Underscoring his lobbying campaign, he gave Gorbachev a videotapedcassette of an old American movie entitled ``Friendly Persuasion,''depicting a story set in the Civil War era.   Gorbachev could be excused for dividing his attention betweenthe summit and a domestic sensation _ an unprecedented instance ofa fallen Soviet leader publicly criticizing those who ousted him.   Former Moscow Communist Party chief Boris N. Yeltsin used aBritish Broadcasting Corp. interview to accuse the Kremlin's No. 2official, Yegor K. Ligachev, of blocking Soviet political reforms.   Yeltsin had been an outspoken supporter of Gorbachev's reforms.In the interview, he said he was hurt by Gorbachev's refusal tosupport him after he criticized Ligachev at a 1987 meeting of theCentral Committee.   Meantime, the American contingent here was growing. SenateMajority Leader Robert Byrd and Bob Dole boarded an Air ForceBoeing 707 in Washington to fly here to attend a ceremony at whichReagan and Gorbachev will exchange the documents of ratification ofthe intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty. The treaty wasapproved by the Senate last Friday and the Soviet Presidium thefollowing day.   In the absence of agreement on a new, major arms treaty onstrategic nuclear weapons, the already-ratified accord will serveas the crowning element of the summit windup on Wednesday. Reaganbids Gorbachev farewell on Thursday and flies to London. On Friday,he returns home.   U.S. officials said several cultural and bilateral agreementswere ready for signing today. The two sides have been working on athree-year extension of the educational and cultural exchangessigned by the two leaders in Geneva in 1985. They also wereexpected to sign agreements on fisheries, cooperating on search andrescue operations at sea and the exchange of transportationtechnologies.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that Reagan andGorbachev had discussed on Monday _ but found no agreement on _Reagan's plans for a ``Star Wars'' space-based anti-missiledefense, the biggest obstacle to a START agreement to cutsuperpower nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent.   Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov reported there was progressin two of the most biggest obstacles to a treaty, involving mobilemissiles and cruise missiles fired from warplanes.   However, a U.S. official, while reporting progress, was not asupbeat. The official, who refused to be identified, said therestill were problems in agreeing on how to count the air-launchedcruise missiles.   As for land-based mobile missiles, the official said, ``wehaven`t heard a verification scheme we think will work. ... I wouldnot expect closure'' on the problem.   Gorbachev, in his Kremlin dinner toast, said: ``Our main taskcontinues to be the working out of an agreement on 50 percentreductions in strategic offensive arms while observing the ABMTreaty,'' the landmark 1972 agreement between the superpowerslimiting missile-defense systems.   Reagan, in his answering speech, said: ``I intend to pursue thesearch for common ground during the months left to me as President.When I pass the job on to my successor, I intend to tell him it isa search that must be continued.''</TEXT></DOC>
