Final decisions on the sanctions are expected at an inter-agencymeeting scheduled Thursday, said the officials, who insisted onanonymity. A formal announcement is likely either Thursday orFriday, they added.   The economic punishment is intended to aggravate an alreadyacute cash shortage in that country and pressure military strongmanManuel Antonio Noriega out of office.   The officials spoke late Tuesday, the same day that the HouseForeign Affairs Committee urged president Reagan to considereconomic sanctions against Panama's military regime.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in response to theHouse committee vote that the administration would not take suchaction lightly.   ``The threat's still out there,'' Fitzwater said. ``Thesituation is changing rapidly and we're still monitoring it. But wedon't want to act precipitously.''   The administration has called for Noriega's ouster since he wasindicted on federal drug trafficking charges in Florida last monthand for a return to civilian rule under President Eric ArturoDelvalle.   Another sanction being considered is the withdrawal ofPanamanian participation in a system of trade preferences accordedto most Third World countries, the officials said. This would makePanamanian products more expensive in U.S. markets.   Another possibility, they said, is Panama's exclusion from theCaribbean Basin Initiative under which some Panamanian products canbe exported to the United States without duties.   Also being considered is suspension of Alaskan oil shipmentsthrough a trans-Panamanian pipeline, from which oil is delivered toU.S. markets on the East Coast.   On March 15, the United States is due to pay the $6.5 millionmonthly installment to the Panama Canal Commission on the $75million to $80 million paid out each year under the canal treaties.   ``The sanctions are not something that we want to do, butsomething that we feel would be responsive and would be helpful,but it's not an action we take lightly,'' Fitzwater said.   Delvalle has been in hiding for more than a week afterattempting to fire Noriega and being, in turn, dismissed by him.   In statement issued at both the White House and State Departmenton Tuesday, the administration said it recognizes Delvalle ``as hewho now exercises the office of president.''   The statement welcomed declarations by Delvalle and Panamanianopposition parties on Monday that called for the establishment of a``government of national reconciliation.''   ``This is a blueprint for progress for democracy in Panama,''the U.S. statement said. ``We support their goal of restoringdemocratic government and civilian constitutional order. Once thisgoal has been achieved, we will work cooperatively with thegovernment of Panama toward the recovery of Panama's financial andeconomic health.''   Fitzwater said the decision on possible sanctions depends upon``a very complicated set of criteria.''   Among them, he said, are the status of the Noriega governmentand the impact that sanctions might have on U.S. interests inPanama. He mentioned the canal and U.S. investments.   In its unanimous vote, the Foreign Affairs Committee endorsedReagan's course of action against the military regime as well asurging him to consider sanctions.   The resolution will be voted on by the House this week. Itreaffirms congressional support for the full implementation of thePanama Canal treaties, which require the United States to hand thecanal over to Panama at the end of the century.   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has adopted a resolutioncalling for a total trade embargo against Panama, but severalmembers of the House panel said they thought that approach waspremature.</TEXT></DOC>
