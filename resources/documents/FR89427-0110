Consideration of Issuance of Amendment toFacility Operating License and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for Hearing</ITAG>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is consideringissuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF-39, issuedto the Philadelphia Electric Company, (the licensee), for operation ofthe Limerick Generating Station, Unit 1, located in Montgomery and ChesterCounties, Pennsylvania. The proposed amendment is in response to the licensee'ssubmittal dated February 14, 1986.The proposed amendment would make administrative changes to the TechnicalSpecifications (TS) to achieve consistency, remove outdated material, makeminor text changes, and correct errors. The changes are grouped into fourcategories.(1) Category A changes deal with correction of errors or the removal ofoutdated material. Specifcially, Pages 3/4 7-22 and 6-14 delete a referenceto 5% power (at *). Page 3/4 3-85 deletes a reference to initial criticality(at andplusmin;). These references are no longer applicable. These conditionshave been satisfied and the footnotes would be deleted. Page 3/4 3-85 alsowould add ``/'' between ``1'' and ``location'' for instrument 4. The primaryand secondary containment isolation trip functions on the outside atmosphereto reactor enclosure and refueling area differential pressure low TripSetpoint and Allowable Value on Pages 3/4 3-21 and 3/4 3-22 (items e. andf.) would use the engineering units ``inches of H<T2>2</T2>O'' to eliminate ambiguity. The reference to Figure B 3/4 4.6-2on Page 3/4 4-19 (item 4.4.6.1.4) would be deleted because this figuredoes not exist in the TS. The drywell average air temperature sensor elevationand azimuth locations on Page 3/4 6-10 are provided to give approximatelocations. The symbol ``andCx.11;'' would be added to these locations. Thefootnote ``*'' on pages 3/4 6-47 and 3/4 6-52 will be corrected by replacingthe word ``and'' with the word ``or''. The referenced penetration ``035A''on Pages 3/4 6-23 and 3/4 6-42 will be corrected to ``035B''. An additionalAction c. will be added on Page 3/4 1-2 indicating that ``The provisionsof Specification 4.0.4 are not applicable'', because the reactor must firstbe in Operational Condition 1 or 2 to perform the surveillance. The numberof heat detectors for Fire Zone 25 on Page 3/4 3-94 in incorrect and wouldbe revised from ``15'' to ``13''. The two other heat detectors actuallyare located in the Unit 2 area. The word ``positive'' on Page B 3/4 6-2,item 3/4.6.1.6, would be deleted, because the allowable containment pressurerange is actually both negative and positive.(2) Category B changes deal with minor text changes to achieve consistencythroughout the TS. Specifically, Specification 3.6.3 on Page 3/4 6-17 includesan Action Statement that allows four hours to restore (for example) aninoperable Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV), while Specification 3.4.7on Page 3/4 4-23 allows eight hours to restore an inoperable MSIV. Thechange would revise Specification 3.4.7 to four hours from the existingeight hour requirement. The change to footnote `` ** '' on Pages 3/4 5-4and 3/4 5-5 would add a requirement that ``In the event that HPCI systemis not successfully demonstrated operable during the twelve hour period,then reactor steam dome pressure is to be reduced to less than 200 psig.In the event that ADS cannot be demonstrated operable during the twelvehour period, then reactor steam dome pressure is to be reduced to lessthan 100 psig''. This would be consistent with the respective Action Statementsfor each system. The drywell and suppression chamber internal pressuredesignated in the Limiting Condition for Operation on Page 3/4 6-9 wouldbe corrected to ``^1.0 to +2.0'' consistent with that specified on PageB 3/4 6-2. The change to Note 17 on Page 3/4 6-42 would include a statementthat ``Type C test is not required'' consistent with other notations inthe table and the fact that a Type A test is already indicated. The changeto footnote `` * '' on Pages 3/4 7-9 and 3/4 7-10 would add a requirementthat ``In the event that RCIC operability is not successfully demonstratedduring the twelve hour period, then reactor steam dome pressure is to bereduced to less than 150 psig''. This would be consistent with the RCICAction Statement. The change to Action b. on Page 3/4 8-1 would add a referenceto Action e., because Action e. could be overlooked during the performanceof Action b. The change to Action Statement 101 on Page 3/4 3-100 wouldrevise the lower limit of detection for gammas to 0.5 micro-microcuries/mL,consistent with the gamma limit specified on Page 3/4 11-2.(3) Category C changes deal with minor text changes that provide additionallimitations or restrictions. Specifically, TS 3.6.2.1.c on Page 3/4 6-12would be revised by adding an additional limit specifying that ``one temperatureinstrument in each of the eight locations shall be operable''. The existingspecification calls for the operability of at least eight indicators withoutdenoting their locations. The change to Specification 3.6.3. on Page<ITAG tagnum="10">3/4 6-17 and 4.3.6.4. on Page 3/4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">6-18 would delete ``reactor'' and reference only ``instrumentation''line excess flow check valves. The change allows all instrument line excessflow check valves to be referenced, rather than only the reactor instrumentline excess flow check valves.(4) Category D changes deal with changes that eliminate ambiguity, deletesuperflous information, correct ``information only'' designations or addlocation information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">a. <T3>Page 3/4 3-23</T3>The addition of TABLE NOTATIONS ``(a)'' and ``**'', which the licenseeproposes to add to Page 3/4 3-23, Item 1.a.2), adds further clarificationto include : 13 seconds response time for associated valves (10 secondsdiesel generator starting and 3 seconds sequence loading delays). Thischange is consistent with the specifications for the Reactor Vessel WaterLevel low, low-level 2 and the Main Steam Line Isolation response timesfor radiation, flow, and pressure, which also include the : 13 secondsresponse time. These added notations eliminate ambiguity and allow forconsistent interpretation. The change is justified as a clarification ofthe existing specifications to allow for consistency.This proposed change falls within the example category (i) of those providedby the Commission for amendments that are not likely to involve SignificantHazards Consideration, because the proposed change allows for consistencethroughout the Technical Specifications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">b. <T3>Page 3/4 6-10</T3>The drywell average air temperature is the calculated volumetric averageof the temperature readings at four drywell elevations. At elevation 330andmin172;there are three installed temperature sensors, and also three sensors installedat elevation 320andmin172;, three at 260andmin172;, and six at 248andmin172;.The volumetric calculation requires only that one sensor at each elevationbe read, without regard to the sensor's (compass) location, i.e., onlythe elevation location is of interest in the calculation and not the azimuthlocation. The azimuth has been listed in the surveillance requirementsas an information guide, so that the exact location of each sensor is known,even though the azimuth of each sensor is not a factor in the actual calculation.Because the azimuth of each sensor is listed, relocation of any of thesesensors at the same elevation would require an amendment to the TechnicalSpecifications, even though the intent of the Technical Specificationsclearly does not require this information as a limit. Some readings takenfrom these sensors could be erroneous if a sensor's azimuth location isnot changed, because of nearby hot or cold pipes.The licensee proposes to revise the identity of drywell temperature sensorsat each elevation from ``azimuth'' to ``quantity'' to allow sensor azimuthrelocation and preclude erroneous drywell readings. This flexibility willeliminate the need for amendments to the Technical Specifications eachtime a drywell modification calls for the relocation of a temperature sensor.To allow for physical limitations in the installation of equipment, thelicensee also proposes to add the word (or symbol) ``Approximate'' beforeeach elevation.Because this proposed change merely changes the ``information only'' designationsof ``azimuth'' to ``quantity'' at each elevation and adds ``approximate''before elevation, it falls within the example category of amendments thatare considered not likely to involve Significant Hazards Considerationsas they constitute ``a purely administrative * * * change in nomenclature.''Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission willhave made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended(the Act) and the Commission's regulations.The licensee has evaluated the administrative changes that achieve consistencythroughout the TS, that remove outdated material, make minor text changesand correct errors against the standards provided above, and has determinedthat the changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration. Thesechanges provide improvements to the TS by correcting errors, eliminatingambiguities and inconsistencies, or denoting additional limitations orrestrictions. The staff agrees with this evaluation.The Commission has provided examples (51 FR 7751) of amendments that arenot likely to involve significant hazards considerations. One of theseexamples, (i) states that ``A purely administrative change to the TechnicalSpecifications for example a change to achieve consistency throughout thetechnical specifications, correction of an error, or a change in nomenclature.''The proposed correction of errors and removal of outdated material listedin Category A, and the minor text changes to achieve consistency throughoutthe TS listed in Category B, above, are similar to example (i). A secondof these examples, (ii), states that ``A change that constitutes an additionallimitation, restriction, or control not presently included in the technicalspecification, e.g. a more stringent surveillance requirement.'' The proposedminor text changes that provide additional limitation or restrictions listedin Category C, above, are similar to example (ii).The staff has reviewed the licensee's evaluation and determination andagrees with the licensee that this proposed amendment does not involvea significant hazards consideration. Therefore, the staff proposes to determinethat the proposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing.Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice.Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-216, Phillips Building,7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. Copiesof written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public DocumentRoom, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearingand petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.By May 30, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Request for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) Thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above.Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party.Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held.If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing heldwould take place after issuance of the amendment.If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment.Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would resultin derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the licenseamendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided thatits final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The final determination will consider all public and Statecomments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publisha notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance.The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur veryinfrequently.A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Att: Docketing and Service Branch, or may be deliveredto the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last ten (10)days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptlyso inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Unionat (800) 325-6000 (in Missouri (800) 342-6700). the Western Union operatorshould be given Datagram Identification Number 3737 and the following messageaddressed to Walter R. Butler, Director, Project directorate I-2, Divisionof Reactor Projects I/II: petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington,DC 20555, and to Conner and Wetterhahn, 1747 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.,Washington, DC 20006, attorney for the licensee.Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petition and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)((1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated February 14, 1986, which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room, Pottstown Public Library,500 High Street, Pottstown, Pennsylvania 19464.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 21st day of April 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Walter R.
