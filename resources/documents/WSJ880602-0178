If the cost per cigarette were comparable to the street cost per usage of an illegal drug, such as cocaine or heroin, then Mr. Merryman would not have been able to make such a statement.    I cannot help wondering how much more frequent such crime would be if cigarettes were not legal and therefore cost significantly more than the five or six cents they now cost. Or, conversely, how much that sort of crime would diminish if currently illegal drugs were decriminalized, reducing the cost to the user, who is going to use the drug anyway (as we found out with the attempt to prohibit the use of alcohol earlier this century).    Of course, the kind of crime of which Mr. Merryman speaks is only the tip of the iceberg. The truly most insidious result of illegal drugs, other than the physical effects on the users, is the support they provide to organized crime.    Donald R. Goyette   San Diego, Calif.   ---   Surgeon General Koop is way out in left field. I smoked for 50 years because I enjoyed it, and I wanted to. When I had solid evidence that it was adversely affecting my body, I quit suddenly with practically no withdrawal symptoms. There was no agony or pain, and I didn't have a fit.    W.T.
