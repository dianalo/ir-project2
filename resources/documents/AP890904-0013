From marriage counselors to immigration consultants, thousands inthis British colony are capitalizing on a growing desperation about1997 _ when Hong Kong comes under China's rule. Some appear to beprofiting illegally.   Emigration industry specialists say hundreds of millions ofdollars are being spent by nervous residents who want to flee thecolony. And, they say, business is bound to improve.   The June 4 crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing hassparked more interest in emigration than ever before.   Last year, 45,000 people left Hong Kong, mostly for the UnitedStates, Canada and Australia. The number is expected to rise thisyear.   A survey in August said two out of every five residents want toemigrate, indicating few among the colony's 5.7 million peoplebelieve in China's promise to maintain Hong Kong's economic systemfor at least 50 years.   On a recent weekend at the Hong Kong Convention Center, about50,000 people packed a show on overseas investment and immigrationopportunities.   Australian women sporting bright blue 10-gallon hats hawkedhouses in Perth. Videos showed sandpipers speeding down a Uruguayanbeach and told of the wonders of investing in that Latin Americancountry. A movie beckoned, ``Come to New Zealand and be free.''   One consultant's Chinese sign promised a Peruvian passport for$1,500 and 20 days in Lima. The Peruvian Consulate said it wasimpossible.   Another consultant was selling $100,000 investments in the UnitedStates, although America does not accept business immigrants.   ``There's always a window,'' said former chemist Junny Co, with awry smile and a wink as he passed out leaflets with the investmentinformation. ``I'm selling the American dream.''   Surveying the crowd, Peter Tse, a real estate agent for anAustralian company, heaved a sigh.   ``There's a sucker born every minute,'' he said. ``I'm justselling houses. But the consultants, they're exploiting fear.''   Indeed, in the immigration industry consultants are the bigmoney-makers, charging as much as $50,000 for a successful case.   Consultants help prospective emigrants fill out forms, draw upbusiness proposals and determine whether they have the necessarycredentials to emigrate.   Since January, the ranks of Hong Kong-based consultants haveswollen to 600, a 100 percent jump, according to Alex Lee, anadvertising executive at Saleslink Ltd., which co-sponsored theconvention. Hundreds more, including American lawyers, added to theflock when they set up temporary shop in hotel rooms around thecolony.   At the conference, Jagson Cheu elbowed his way out of a booth runby a New Zealand investment company.   ``They want all my money just to go to the bottom of the world, Ican't believe it,'' said the securities trader. ``But I don't have achoice, I need help. Right now I'm just looking for the cheapestthief.''   Despite dozens of complaints of fraud to the Hong Kong ConsumerCouncil, the government does not monitor the industry and there ispractically no way to sue a consultant.   Horatio Cheung, who runs the only non-profit consultancy in thecolony, tells of 290 people who were denied Canadian citizenshipafter being bilked out of thousands of dollars by a consultant whotried to get around Canada's residency requirement.   Earlier this year, Royal Canadian Mounted Police raided a lawfirm in Toronto and several Canadian lawyers have been charged withperjury and other crimes in connection with illegal immigrationpractices.   Those who can't afford a consultant are going back to school toget necessary skills to emigrate. Some countries, like Australia,welcome certain workers, such as pastry chefs and carpenters.Singapore, which is facing a labor shortage, recently lowered itsstandards for immigrants, sparking 30,000 Hong Kong residents to mobthe application office.   But competition for seats in Hong Kong's few universities isintense. The Open Learning Institute, Hong Kong's newestcollege-level facility, recently received 60,000 applications for5,000 spots for the upcoming school year. The government-run schoolmade about $380,000 from applications alone.   Fears about the takeover have also helped Hong Kong's matchmakingindustry.   Maria Mo, manager of the International Computer MarriageConsulting agency, says clients looking for a spouse with a foreignpassport have increased by 50 percent since June 4. Her company nowgets up to 200 inquiries a month and charges at least $1,000 forcompleted marriages.   R. Shek, who is looking for a Western husband, said the crackdownmade her want to leave Hong Kong as soon as possible.   ``Hong Kong life used to be peaceful,'' said Shek, an executivesecretary at an international firm, ``but now it's time to leave. Idon't have enough money to buy a passport so marriage to a Westerneris the best route for me.''   But this sector, too, is tainted by suspect practices. Onematchmaker showed letters from foreign men to his office, offeringmarriage for a ``reasonable price,'' or $35,000.   The immigration business has spawned its own service industrywith TV and radio talk shows, newspapers and magazines.   The Emigrant magazine started last year and now boasts 14,000subscribers and a thick advertisement section, pushing land inJamaica, passports in Latin America and factories in South Africa.   ``We have people in line at all hours buying back issues,''Editor Katherine Kreuter said. ``This is definitely a growthindustry.''</TEXT></DOC>
