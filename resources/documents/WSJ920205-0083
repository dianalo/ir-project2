The 69-year-old widow in Leawood, Kan., is taking moneyout of bank certificates of deposit and bonds and buyingstocks. &quot;Now the stock market is the only game in town forpeople like me,&quot; she says.   &quot;I'm just not going to accept a 4% CD,&quot; Mrs. Clarke adds.&quot;And there's no way I'm going to lock up my money in a 7%U.S. Treasury bond or a 6% municipal bond for 10 years.&quot; Sheworries that when interest rates eventually turn up, bondprices will sink, &quot;leaving me holding the bag.&quot;   Mrs. Clarke is hardly alone. With short-term interestrates at their lowest level in nearly two decades andlong-term rates the lowest in about five years, millions ofAmericans are rethinking their investment strategies. Theyare repaying debt and refinancing mortgages as they move outof CDs and similar cash-like investments. Although some aretaking on more risk in an attempt to duplicate thedouble-digit returns of a couple of years ago, most savvyinvestors are thinking carefully about any new moves.   &quot;People are being cautious with their money this timearound,&quot; says Roger Servison, president of Fidelity RetailMarketing Co., a unit of Fidelity Investments in Boston.&quot;It's a different mix of business than 1987, when they werechasing junk bonds and the highflying growth stocks.&quot; In thestock arena, growth-and-income funds, which focus ondividend-paying companies, are now outselling pure growthfunds, and in the bond area, people are sticking togovernment funds, he says.   Kurt Brouwer, partner in Brouwer andamp; Janachowski, a SanFrancisco investment advisory firm, agrees. &quot;We've returnedto a more sober, value orientation in this country. It's veryrefreshing,&quot; he says.   But is it really smart to narrow your investment options?   Perhaps not. Some advisers suggest this is a good time forinvestors to look to a range of other investments. Some say,for example, that the combination of low mortgage rates andweak real-estate prices makes this a good time to look for asecond home. &quot;It's an investment you may someday live in,&quot;says George Barbee, executive director of client services atPrice Waterhouse andamp; Co., the accounting firm. &quot;Particularlyfor a lot of baby-boomer types, this is not a bad time to belooking out 10 years or more to where you want to live whenyou retire.&quot; A caveat: Real estate can be illiquid.   However, advisers even to wealthy individuals aren'trecommending aggressively taking on debt -- even though itscurrent low cost makes it seem attractive -- to makeinvestments beyond mortgage refinancing or purchase of ahome. Earl D. Osborn, a partner in the San Franciscoinvestment advisory firm of Osborn, Bingham andamp; Scarborough,says that adding debt &quot;makes sense from the pure investmentpoint of view&quot; but it may not work out &quot;from the cash-flowpoint of view.&quot;   The problem is that even wealthy individuals can borrowtoo much and have difficulty making payments on the debt ifthe stock market or real-estate investments take a nastyplunge, he says. &quot;Say the market drops 50% -- you must besure you can make all the payments irrespective of thevolatility of the portfolio.&quot;   And Neil Plass, chairman of the investment policycommittee at Boston Co., the American Express Co. unit thatprovides financial services to wealthy individuals, saysbusiness considerations, not low interest rates, should bethe deciding factor in whether to borrow for something likebuying an apartment building or a business venture. &quot;Itdepends on how realistic your cash-flow expectations are,&quot; hesays.   To most individual investors, the stock market poses asmuch risk as they want to bear. And, for all the caution,many have taken the plunge and have helped push stock pricesto all-time highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closedyesterday at a record 3272.81.   Sales of stock mutual funds soared to records last year,and fund managers say January sales were strong. VanguardGroup in Valley Forge, Pa., for instance, reports that lastmonth investors poured about $750 million of new cash, arecord, into its stock funds.   And tens of billions of dollars went into bond funds in1991, the largest inflow in five years. Short-term bondfunds, global bond funds and funds that invest inmortgage-backed securities -- all of which offer betterreturns than money-market funds and CDs -- were among the hotsellers.   Financial professionals say now is a time for investors tore-evaluate their finances. &quot;Figure out how much money you'regoing to need in the next three to six months, then take itout two to three years, five to 10 years, for educating thekids, your retirement. Then you know what's investable,&quot; Mr.Barbee says.   He recommends that people start by increasing theiremergency funds from the usual three to six months ofexpenses to six to nine months. &quot;A lot more people arefinding themselves looking down a barrel,&quot; he says. &quot;And it'staking a lot more time to find a job.&quot;   People are thinking about that. In the past four months,John Grable, a 27-year-old church administrator in Boston,has used cash from a money-market fund to reduce hiscredit-card debt to $500 from $3,500. He and his wife arealso trying to pay off the $6,000 left on their auto loan andare putting $600 a month into mutual funds. &quot;I don't want tobe in New England's economy with a lot of debt and thepossibility of losing a job,&quot; he says.   Paying down debt is one way for individuals to reap hugereturns, financial pros say. While yields on CDs and moneyfunds have plunged, credit-card rates have hardly budged.Paying off the balance on a credit card carrying a 19%interest rate, which is about average, is equal to a 27.5%return on a taxable investment for an investor in the 31% taxbracket.   Individuals are also refinancing mortgages. Alan Minoff, a46-year-old Chicago retailing executive, estimates that he issaving about $22,000 a year because he switched from a15-year fixed-rate mortgage at 10% into a 30-yearadjustable-rate loan that started out at 7.125%. And thatadjustable rate was just reset at 7%.   Mr. Minoff chose the variable rate because he doesn'texpect to keep his current home more than a few years. Mosthomeowners planning to stay put for a while prefer fixed-ratemortgages, which in two years have dropped nearly twopercentage points. The savings on a $100,000, 30-year loancould run almost $150 a month.   For long-term growth, financial advisers recommend stocks.A lot of people are buying growth stocks that have goodearnings records and pay dividends, and stocks ofwell-managed utilities in regions not suffering seriouslyfrom the recession. Investors are also dollar-cost averaging,that is, investing equal amounts of money over time insteadof making a one-time plunge. And many are choosing mutualfunds rather than individual stocks.   However, Stan Young, a financial counselor at P.R. TaylorInc., a Palo Alto, Calif., investment-banking and advisoryfirm, worries that people are moving too quickly out of CDsand allocating too much money to high-priced stocks.   Mrs. Clarke, the Kansas widow who's replacing her CDs withstocks, says she &quot;doesn't want to be foolish and take wildchances.&quot; A University of Chicago Business School graduate,she uses a computer and a shelf full of investment softwareto help manage her money. She looks for blue-chip growthstocks that haven't been bid up as high as some highflyingshares. Some of her purchases: Philip Morris Cos., BordenInc. and General Electric Co. Even though these stocks havesolid earnings-growth records, they haven't participatedfully in the market's rally.   Philip J. Keating, a 48-year-old investor in FortLauderdale, Fla., likes to hunt for undervalued stocks. InDecember, he purchased shares in Upjohn Co., a drug makerplagued by negative publicity about possible side effects ofits sleeping medication, Halcion. Upjohn says the drug issafe when used as recommended, and Mr. Keating thinks theproblems are overblown and notes that the stock sells forless than most drug issues. If you put Upjohn's 3.2% dividendtogether with any future increases in its payout and in thestock price, &quot;you have a good total-return stock, especiallyat a time when money-market funds are returning 4%,&quot; he says.   Utility stocks also are popular. &quot;Many pay dividends inthe 5% to 6% area, and you have the potential for capitalappreciation,&quot; says John Wimbiscus, manager of executivefinancial planning for accountants Deloitte andamp; Touche inChicago. Although utility stocks usually don't rise steeply,they have only one-third the market risk of other equities,Mr. Wimbiscus says.   For similar reasons, the &quot;Baby Bells,&quot; the telephonecompanies spun off from American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. inthe mid-1980s, &quot;are doing well,&quot; says Mr. Brouwer, the SanFrancisco adviser. &quot;They pay pretty good dividends, and thedividends increase every year, usually outpacing inflation.That's more than you can say for CDs.&quot;   Many investors are investing in &quot;index&quot; funds, mutualfunds that buy a group of stocks that track a particularmarket benchmark, such as the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 StockIndex. Indeed, Vanguard Group says half the money coming intoits stock funds this year is going into index funds.   Although these funds won't be the top performers, theinvestors buying them apparently prefer them to trying topick stocks or funds themselves or paying a money manager todo it for them. &quot;Long term, it's hard for managed money tobeat the 35 basis points {0.35% of assets} that awell-managed index fund charges,&quot; says Mr. Minoff, theChicago retailer.   Meanwhile, high stock prices are keeping some investors onthe sidelines. Paul Weiss, a 44-year-old radiologist inPittsford, N.Y., says he hasn't put any new money into stocksfor a year. He's holding onto those he has and hoarding extracash in a fund that invests only in Treasury securities. Henotes, however, that &quot;had I been spending more time managingmy portfolio, I would have switched to a short-term bond fundto pick up a little more yield.&quot; Short-term bond funds pay apercentage point or so more than money funds do, and thevalue of their principal fluctuates very little because theyinvest in securities maturing in only one to five years.   Advisers generally caution against long-term bonds orlong-term-bond funds while interest rates are decliningbecause the principal will take a hit when rates turn backup. But some like municipal bonds. Their yields are &quot;veryattractive compared to taxable&quot; bonds, says Hutch Vernon, amoney manager at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. &quot;Thebudget crisis in many states makes it likely that tax rateswill go up rather than down, making them even moreattractive.&quot;   People buying munis, however, should pay attention tocredit quality and to whether the bonds are &quot;callable,&quot; thatis, whether they can be redeemed before maturity. &quot;Know whatyou're buying,&quot; warns Mr. Plass at Boston Co. &quot;You may thinkyou're locked in {to a high yield} and find that itdisappears.&quot;   Financial experts say every investor should have somebonds. &quot;Being all in stocks or all in bonds, you exposeyourself to much greater risk than with a balancedportfolio,&quot; Mr. Vernon says.   Mr. Minoff has gotten that message. The Chicago retaileris 40% in fixed-income securities, mostly intermediate-termgovernment bonds and short-term municipals, and as the stockmarket rises, he allocates more money to bonds to keep hisportfolio in balance. He also says he hasn't stretched outmaturities or compromised quality to get a better yield. &quot;Inthe 1970s and early '80s, I burned my way through everyinvestment fad -- limited partnerships, a second home -- andthey were all dogs,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't believe in going forthe big kill.&quot;   However, some investors are still taking risks. IraLippman, a 40-year-old candy-store owner in Burbank, Calif.,is trying to cash in on the beaten-down real-estate market.Last year, he paid $40,000 for four real-estate partnerships,all in rental storage facilities run by Public Storage, areal-estate investment trust. He bought all four at adiscount; for example, one partnership originally cost $500 ashare, but Mr. Lippman bought 60 shares at $170 each. &quot;Atthat price, I will get a yield of 10% a year on my capital,&quot;he says. In 15 years or so, he believes, the real estate willbe worth much more, and the ultimate payoff will come whenthe facilities are refinanced or sold.   Real-estate investment trusts are being recommended byPatrick Mullin, a Cleveland-based partner with Deloitte andamp;Touche. REITs, he notes, are traded on stock exchanges andthus marketable, yet they generate little taxable income.REITS that invest in apartments are a good bet, he adds,because of the growing population. &quot;Look for high-quality,investment-grade properties,&quot; he advises. &quot;The decisionshould be driven by economics, not tax considerations.&quot;   And at T. Rowe Price, Mr. Vernon recommends &quot;high-quality&quot;junk-bond funds. Their prices have risen, he says, ascompanies have refinanced debt and sold equity. But watch fora narrowing of interest-rate spreads between junk andinvestment-grade debt, he warns. &quot;It's a reasonableinvestment . . . so long as you're getting paid for therisks,&quot; he says.   Mrs. Clarke, the Kansas widow, acknowledges that &quot;theselow rates are forcing me to do some riskier things than Iwould have done otherwise.&quot; She recently bought a fewlong-term equity anticipation securities, or LEAPS, on PhilipMorris, Abbott Laboratories and Merck. Like ordinary options,LEAPS are a contract to buy or sell stock at a set pricewithin a specific period. But LEAPS don't expire for twoyears, compared with a maximum of nine months for standardoptions, and thus they permit investors to make longer-termbets on the market without risking the full price of thestock.   And some investors are taking big risks despiteprofessional advice to the contrary. In New Orleans, LelandBeach, 50, a freelance musician, and his wife Judy, 48, avoice and piano teacher, are placing their bets on highflyingbiotechnology securities. They've bought shares in Amgen,Genetics Institute and the Fidelity Select Biotechnologymutual fund.   &quot;We know these stocks and funds are volatile and risky,&quot;says Mrs. Beach, noting that the couple is &quot;heavily dependenton our investments&quot; since Mr. Beach lost his regular job whenthe New Orleans Symphony Orchestra disbanded. &quot;We have tomake our money work for us,&quot; she says. &quot;I know we are puttingour necks on the line. We're scared to death.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
