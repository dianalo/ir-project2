They tend to lose their impetus when things getbetter.;    But some optimistic observers see longer-term forces at work thatthey contend could be favorable for interest rates beyond the next swing ofthe economic pendulum.;    For one thing, they say, the outlook for inflation-- an important determinant of interest rates -- seems brighter than it hasbeen in quite some time.;    On top of that, they argue that enthusiasm forborrowing in this country may remain subdued for some time, in the aftermathof the nation's &quot;leverage binge&quot; in the 1980s.;    &quot;The escalating use of debtshaped the 1980s, and a turn away from debt will shape the 1990s,&quot; maintainsGreg Smith at Prudential-Bache Securities.;    He said that if reducedborrowing translates into lower world economic growth in the 1990s, &quot;lowerinflation and lower interest rates are quite likely results.&quot;;    RobertBarbera, economy-watcher at Shearson Lehman Brothers, contends that the&quot;disinflation&quot; that began in the 1980s is headed into a new phase.;   &quot;Today's recession will take inflation down to levels not seen since the early1960s,&quot; he says.;    &quot;During the 1980s, inflation expectations took longer tosquelch and, as a consequence, interest rates remained extraordinarily higherthan inflation justified.;    &quot;We are now on the threshold of a drop in U.S.interest rates that will reflect both the unfolding slide in U.S. inflationand the shrinking of real (inflation-adjusted) rates.&quot;;    If that sort ofthing happens, stock fans see some juicy possibilities for their market. Alasting decline in interest rates would dampen the appeal of short-term moneymarket investments, which have been formidable competition for stocks over thelast few decades.;    &quot;To maintain their accustomed nominal rates of return,&quot;says Smith, &quot;individuals will have to consider alternative investments.&quot;;   In theory at least, that could translate into a willingness among investors topay substantially higher prices for stocks, even if corporate earnings growthwas only moderate.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York; Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Home  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910225  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  15D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  389  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday February 25, 199100056014,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
