The Mortgage Bankers Association of America said 4.73 percent ofthe payments on the 10.8 million mortgages surveyed in the thirdquarter were at least 30 days late.   It was the lowest rate since the third quarter of 1987, when 4.71percent of the mortgage payers were behind. The rate a year ago wasthe lowest in eight years. In the second quarter, the delinquencyrate was 4.90 percent.   The foreclosure rate edged down to 0.26 percent in the thirdquarter, compared with 0.27 percent in the second quarter.   Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the association, saidhe was ``very heartened'' by the decline, but the report noted amixed pattern regionally.   In North Central states, the delinquency rate was 4.88 percent,down from 5.30 percent a year ago. The rate in the Northeast wasunchanged from a year ago at 4.12 percent, the lowest of fourregions.   However, the rate in the South rose from 5.25 percent last yearto 5.29 percent. The rate in the West was 4.28 percent in the thirdquarter, up from 4.10 percent a year ago.   A high employment level in the United States generally has helpedkeep delinquencies low. The South has had a relatively high ratebecause Texas and other Southwestern states are struggling with adepressed oil industry.   Two offsetting trends will affect delinquencies next year.Interest rates are rising, increasing the monthly payments onadjustable-rate mortgages. However, the economy is expected toremain strong, at least through mid-year, keeping the unemploymentrate low.</TEXT></DOC>
