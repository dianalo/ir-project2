Ajudge later ordered the employees back to work.   Teamsters Local 808 set up picket lines at Grand CentralTerminal and several other stations, and other unions, includingtrain engineers, honored the picket lines, said Metro-NorthCommuter Railroad spokeswoman Susan Gilbert.   ``We are not running trains on any of the lines,'' Ms. Gilbertsaid.   By 11 a.m., the railroad obtained a back-to-work order from U.S.District Judge Inzer Wyatt, Gilbert said.   ``If it's legitimate and our lawyers tell us its legal, ofcourse we'll comply,'' said John Mahoney, union secretary-treasurer.   A spokesman for the National Mediation Board, which overseesrailroad labor disputes, said the strike was illegal.   In Chicago today, an estimated 2,600 employees went on strikeagainst the Chicago andamp; North Western railroad in a walkout timed tobegin as soon rush hour ended to avoid disruptions. Candamp;NW is aleading Midwestern freight hauler and also runs commuter trainsserving 40,000 people a day in Chicago's suburbs.   The fate of the evening rush hour remained in the hands ofCongress, where the House today was to consider a measure imposinga settlement.   The New York City strike, prompted by overtime practices thatthe union said endangers passengers, forced thousands of commutersto find other ways to get to work. Metro-North, caught by surpriseby the walkout, had no contingency plan.   ``I am advising people to either take regularly scheduled busesor somehow get to the Bronx to take subways,'' Ms. Gilbert said.   At Pelham, north of the city, commuters piled into taxis for a$4 ride to a Bronx subway station. ``This is screwing everythingup, isn't it?'' said one man.   As a cab driver pondered whether to take a fifth passenger, thedispatcher cajoled him over the radio, ``Tell them to sit closer tothe driver. No extra charge.''   Cars headed for Manhattan from the northern suburbs backed upduring the morning rush, and traffic on Connecticut highways intoNew York was heavier than usual, police said.   At a Bronx subway stop, a man in cufflinks who would not givehis name looked long and hard before deciding that the newsstandsdid not carry the Wall Street Journal.   The walkout was prompted by the suspension of 37 employeesTuesday for refusing to work overtime, the union said. Unionmembers said the men had been handling 400-pound bridge timbers foreight hours and wanted to go home.   ``The quality of work is diminished by fatigue and fatiguecreates lack of safety for workers and commuters,'' said a striker,Mike Pearson.   The union said in a statement that it was forced to strike ``toforce the railroad to recognize its responsibility to provide asafe railroad for its commuters and its employees.''   Local 808 has been without a contract since January 1986.Negotiations under way since 1985 have been stalled, Mahoney said.Metro-North trains, serving 95,000 commuters daily, run betweenManhattan and the city's northern suburbs and Connecticut.   ``It's an illegal strike,'' said Charles Barnes, executivedirector of the National Mediation Board. ``It's a disruption ofthe status quo by the union. I should think that as soon as theycan get to a judge, it will stop.''   Commuters who tried to board Amtrak trains at Bridgeport,Stamford or New Haven in Connecticut or in New Rochelle, the onlystops Amtrak make along Metro-North routes, were told they wouldhave to buy a trip to Newark, N.J., even if they wanted to get offin New York City.   ``We don't sell tickets, today or any day, from New Haven toPenn Station (New York),'' said Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black.``We are not a commuter railroad. That is the territory andbusiness of Metro-North.''   Amtrak operations were not immediately affected by the strike,but Black said Amtrak depends on Metro-North dispatchers for alltrains the run north of New York City. ``We have ordered back-upbuses in the event that we have to ferry passengers overMetro-North territory   The picket lines at Grand Central went up about 4 a.m., saidSgt.
