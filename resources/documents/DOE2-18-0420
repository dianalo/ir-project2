<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-18-0420 </DOCNO><TEXT>Recent refinements in ultrasonographic equipment have led to the inclusionof this imaging tool in the previously established armamentarium of diagnosticprocedures - nuclear imaging, percutaneous biopsy, intravenous urography,angiography, and antegrade and retrograde pyelography. The chief advantageof ultrasonography is its ability to provide important anatomical informationin a noninvasive manner independent of renal function. Further, the transplantedkidney lends itself to ultrasonographic examination: because it has arelatively superficial location, the sound beam is not hampered by gaseousor osseous interposition. An optimal ultrasound image of the transplantedkidney provides excellent detail of gross renal anatomy, and renal axiscan be determined quickly using dynamic or real-time scanning equipment.Routine baseline posttransplantation scanning can be performed as earlyas 24-48 hours following implantation. Significant ultrasonographic changesfrom the baseline study, when correlated with the clinical status andradionuclide studies, aid in the diagnosis and management of posttransplantcomplications.</TEXT></DOC>
