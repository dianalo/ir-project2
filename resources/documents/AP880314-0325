Grain futures also closedhigher.   On other markets, crude oil futures tumbled well below $16 abarrel; livestock and meat futures advanced sharply; preciousmetals posted slight gains; and stock-index futures advanced.   Prices for delivery of new-crop soybeans _ those to be harvestedthis fall as opposed to those already in storage _ posted thegreatest gains on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction talk aboutestimates issued Monday morning by Sparks Commodities Inc., aprivate analytical firm based in Memphis, Tenn.   Sparks reportedly pegged 1988 U.S. soybean plantings at 57.5million acres, just slightly above last year's 57.4 million acres.The report followed an estimate of about 60 million acres made lastweek by Refco Inc., a large commodities trading firm.   Earlier trade estimates have been as high as 64 million acres.The Agriculture Department will release its first 1988 crop acreageestimates on March 31.   Sparks would not comment on the figures, which it supplies onlyto its subscribers.   ``That's not the gospel, but it's the closest thing we've gotfor the time being,'' Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean WitterReynolds Inc., said of the reported Sparks estimate.   Mickey Luth, Chicago-based soybean analyst for Shearson LehmanHutton Inc., said the Sparks estimate merely gave the soybeanmarket an excuse to reclaim the losses it sustained last week.   ``You were oversold, you were in a hole,'' Luth said. ``With anexcuse to rally, that's exactly what the market did.''   Luth said he expected 1988 soybean planting to total 58.4million acres.   Sparks also reportedly predicted 1988 corn plantings at 66.8million acres compared to last year's 65.7 million. The estimatewas seen as slightly bullish for corn prices.   Wheat settled 2} cents to 4 cents higher with the contract fordelivery in March at $2.95\ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2{ centshigher with March at $1.98\ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 centshigher with March at $1.90 a bushel; soybeans were 7{ cents to 13{cents higher with March at $6.14} a bushel.   Oil prices fell sharply to below $16 on the New York MercantileExchange in reaction to reports that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largestproducer, had rejected calls for new restrictions on production.   Crude prices had moved above $16 late last week after members ofthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries called for ameeting of the cartel's pricing committee to stabilize marketprices.   Prices for future delivery of refined products also tumbled.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 63 cents to 70 centslower with April at $15.59 cents a barrel; heating oil was 1.30cents to 1.38 cents lower with April at 43.34 cents a gallon;unleaded gasoline was 1.23 cents to 1.33 cents lower with April at44.36 cents a gallon.   Livestock and meat futures posted sharp gains on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange in response to stronger demand for cattle andtighter supplies of hogs, resulting in higher cash prices for both.   Weather worries also helped boost the livestock futures,analysts said. A winter storm moving out of the Rocky Mountainscould slow the movement of animals to market in the northern GreatPlains states, said Tom O'Hare, an analyst in New York with SmithBarney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   Live cattle settled .70 cent to 1.18 cents higher with April at74 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .38 cent to 1.42 cents higherwith March at 82.85 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to 1.50cents higher with April at 45.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellieswere 1.40 cents to 1.90 cents higher with March at 53.57 cents apound.
