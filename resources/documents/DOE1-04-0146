Phase diagrams of the sections Bi{sub 2}Te{sub 3}-Dy{sub 2}Te{sub3}, Bi{sub 2}Te{sub 3}-DyTe, Bi{sub 2}Te{sub 3}-DyBi, Dy-Bi{sub 2}Te{sub3}, Bi-DyTe, DyBi-DyTe, DyBi-Te, and Dy-Bi and the projection of theliquidus surface of the Dy-Bi-Te system were constructed. A ternary,incongruently melting compound is detected in the system, which has thecomposition DyBiTe{sub 3} and crystallizes in the hexagonal system.</TEXT></DOC>
