WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A senior West German official saidFriday that Washington and Bonn have worked out a formula for aface-saving compromise in the dispute over NATO's short-rangenuclear missiles.   Under the compromise, discussed during the Washington visit ofWest German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, the U.S.administration would accept the idea of negotiations with theKremlin if West Germany makes clear it does not seek a ``thirdzero'' _ immediate elimination of short-range weapons.   The reported agreement is mostly symbolic, as no date has beenproposed for the start of superpower talks on the missiles and thetalks remain conditional on an unspecified improvement in theEast-West balance of conventional arms, the source said.   But West Germany and the United States have been arguing overthe issue of short-range missiles for months, and the Washingtontalks appear to have found a common position for the two allies totake with them to the NATO summit in Brussels on May 29-30.   ``It is no longer disputed that there should be negotiations onshort-range weapons,'' said the Bonn official, familiar withStoltenberg's talks in Washington. ``But they (the talks) should beprepared carefully and in relation to conventional reductions.''   The official's explanation of the agreement suggested that U.S.and West German officials had backed down from their previouspositions.   Stoltenberg flew to Washington Wednesday to meet with U.S.Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Defense Secretary DickCheney.   The West German defense minister, appointed only a month ago,was reported to have taken with him a new plan for resolving thedispute that has separated Bonn and Washington and caused a riftwithin the NATO alliance.   Stoltenberg was to propose a link between a reduction of Soviettroops and tanks in Europe and the start of short-rangenegotiations. The Bonn official said that proposal was accepted inprinciple by the U.S. officials Stoltenberg met with.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has begun withdrawing50,000 troops and 5,000 tanks from Eastern Europe and has announcedthat the Kremlin will unilaterally cut its short-range nucleararsenal by 500 warheads.   However, U.S. officials have said both gestures fall short ofwhat is needed to warrant revision of NATO defense policy.   Baker told reporters in Washington earlier this week that heconsidered short-range negotiations ``a mistake'' under the currentcircumstances.   Washington contends NATO should stand by its ``flexibleresponse'' doctrine, or retention of some nuclear weapons in Europefor use in repelling a potential attack by the East bloc's superiorconventional forces.   But as both military blocs have begun dismantling theirintermediate-range nuclear missiles under the 1987 INF treaty, theburden of hosting a nuclear option has shifted to West Germany,where most of NATO's short-range systems are deployed.   Of the 88 short-range Lance missile launchers stationed inCentral Europe by NATO, 76 are in West Germany.   Bonn has refused to go along with a NATO plan to upgrade theLance missiles, which have a range of about 75 miles, with newrockets capable of reaching targets as far away as 300 miles untilthe superpowers take some interim steps to reduce the weapons theyhave deployed in Europe.   NATO's plan is widely opposed in West Germany for fear it willdamage improving relations with Eastern Europe and chances forfurther progress on arms control progress.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze threatened during avisit to Bonn last weekend that the Kremlin might halt destructionof its SS-23s, one of the missiles being removed under the INFagreement, if NATO goes ahead with the modernization project.   It was not immediately clear whether the compromise reportedlyworked out by Stoltenberg and U.S. officials on Thursday would beacceptable to other members of the 16-nation NATO alliance, or evenif the junior political parties in Chancellor Helmut Kohl'scoalition would go along.</TEXT></DOC>
