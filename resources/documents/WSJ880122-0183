The exploratory well, drilled to a depth of about 8,350 feet, is flowing at a daily rate of 3,700 barrels of oil and 2.9 million cubic feet of gas.    Consolidated said that it holds a 100% interest in the well and that it is drilling a second well nearby.    George A. Davidson Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said the discovery &quot;promises to provide a significant addition to our oil reserves, which will exceed our previous record levels when tabulations for 1987 are complete.&quot; Consolidated said its record level of oil reserves was 26.6 million barrels in 1985.    Consolidated produces, transports and distributes natural gas, primarily in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York, and other states in the Northeast. The company explores for and produces gas and oil throughout the U.S. and in Canada. </TEXT></DOC>
