External impacts set governmentalinstitutions and national interest groups in motion, and US internationaloil policy is formulated and moulded in the ensuing interactive process.The patterns of policy which developed between 1918 and 1987 on thisbasis are identified and four scenarios for US policy of the 1990s aredeveloped. 'Worst case' is viewed to be a combination of two scenarios;'domestic stalemate' with no internal adaptations and increased importdependence, followed by 'international positioning' in the face of increasedOPEC power and a resulting US activism which could imply increased instabilitiesin the international oil market towards the turn of the century.</TEXT></DOC>
