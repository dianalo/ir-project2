The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesannounced that the ministers were considering an emergencymeeting to deal with the oil glut if the oil marketdeteriorated further.</LP><TEXT>   On that official word from OPEC, prices of North Seacrudes rose as much as 55 cents a barrel in European spotmarkets. In the U.S. futures market, where crude had firmedsharply on Wednesday's rumors of a possible OPEC meetingsoon, prices were up and down during the day but closedlower. The swings, however, were relatively narrow comparedwith the volatile pricing action earlier in the week.   In thin trading in advance of the three-day Easterholiday, West Texas Intermediate crude for May deliverydeclined 28 cents a barrel to settle at $17.78. The Junecrude contract was down 21 cents to $18.51. Other fuelsfutures were mixed, although gasoline showed big drops of asmuch as one cent a gallon.   The OPEC announcement, released at its headquarters inVienna, quoted the acting president, Sadek Boussena ofAlgeria, as saying the ministers were considering &quot;variousoptions&quot; to halt the slide in oil prices. Among the options,according to Mr. Boussena, were &quot;an urgent meeting of theeight-member ministerial monitoring committee and anextraordinary meeting of the conference.&quot;   Until yesterday, OPEC officials still were debatingwhether there would be time -- or the need -- to try to workin a special meeting of the 13 ministers before the midyearconference already set to begin May 25. The ministerialmonitoring committee, which reviews world oil markets, hadscheduled its next meeting two days ahead of the officialconference. That influential committee can only recommendOPEC actions, but its sessions often attract all 13 ministersand can quickly evolve into full meetings.   Still, as crude oil prices plunged in wild trading thisweek -- dropping $1.48 a barrel in 40 minutes beforerebounding Wednesday morning on the New York MercantileExchange -- leading oil ministers grew increasingly worried.They launched a frantic round of phone calls to try to cometo terms on something to firm the market.   &quot;The deterioration of prices has been observed withalarm,&quot; said a senior OPEC official involved in the talks.Discussions will continue through the weekend, he added,noting that European markets will be closed Monday for theEaster weekend, thus giving OPEC another day's breathingroom.   The official said no decision would be taken on a newmeeting date earlier than Tuesday. If by then &quot;production hasdropped or the price has increased, there will be nomeeting,&quot; he said. &quot;But if the situation hasn't improved,&quot; headded, &quot;there will be a meeting -- by April 22 or 23 at thelatest.&quot;   In the statement released by OPEC yesterday afternoonVienna time, Mr. Boussena said he had been in intenseconsultations with his colleagues &quot;with a view to taking thenecessary corrective steps to arrest the present slide andreverse the trend of steady price decline witnessed sinceJanuary.&quot;   In the talks, Mr. Boussena said he had &quot;noted, withsatisfaction, the clear commitment to the minimum referenceprice of $18 per barrel for the OPEC basket and thewillingness to act responsibly in order to safeguard thestability of the oil market and restore prices to the agreedlevel.&quot;   OPEC's first-half production agreement provides for aproduction ceiling of 22 million barrels a day and a minimumreference price of $18 a barrel. OPEC bases its reference ona basket of seven crudes.   The basket average reached $19 a barrel early this year,but now is near $17. Some individual crudes have fallen evenmore -- as much as $6 a barrel. The big factor is high OPECoutput of 24 million barrels a day during this seasonallyslack period for oil demand.   All OPEC nations able to produce above their quotas,including kingpin Saudi Arabia, seem to be doing so. ButKuwait and the United Arab Emirates still are said to be thechief quota violators.   Even so, Mana Said Otaiba, the oil minister of theEmirates, joined in the chorus of complaints from OPEC aboutthe slide in oil prices. &quot;There is a fixed red line which oilprices should not fall behind,&quot; he said, according to theEmirates' news agency.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures contracts moved in narrow rangesin featureless pre-holiday trading. June-delivery gold rose$1.30 an ounce, to $379.70. May silver finished four centslower, at $5.1080 an ounce. July platinum ended the session$1.70 higher, at $486.50 an ounce. William O'Neill, researchdirector for Elders Futures, New York, said the metals seemto be in league with the dollar and are ignoring the wildgoings-on in the energy market. But he said, &quot;If crudeweakens and crashes through the recent lows, it can't helpbut have a negative impact on the precious metals because ofthe deflationary implications.&quot; Mr. O'Neill pointed out thatrecent economic numbers don't reflect a very strong economy,and that &quot;this could cause the Federal Reserve Board to easeits monetary posture somewhat, which would lead to lowerinterest rates. That would be supportive for gold.&quot; He saidinvestor confidence has been shaken by recent Saudi Arabiangold sales, and noted that there have been rumors that theSaudis will be paying for some major arms transactions fairlysoon, which could lead to additional sales of the metal.Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank,New York, said precious metals have been pulled in bothdirections by weak oil prices (negative for gold) and a weakdollar (positive for gold), which have &quot;produced adirectionless market with disappointing volume.&quot; Mr. Mehtasaid he thinks investors fear a credit crunch, and that &quot;ifwe got one, it would produce a weakened real-estate marketand a deflationary environment. That would certainly fosterlower prices for gold.&quot;                                                                                                          COPPER: Prices moved over a fairly broad range, but theMay-delivery contract finished down only 1.25 cents a pound,at $1.1685, after being as high as $1.20 a pound. Mr. O'Neillof Elders Futures said that even though strike-affectedSouthern Peru Copper Corp. hasn't declared a force majeure,it has in effect put one in place for April. A force majeureis a condition that would permit a company to depart from thestrict terms of a contract -- in this case the delivery ofcopper for April -- because of an event or effect that can'tbe reasonably anticipated or controlled. The company's minersand smelter workers in Peru have been on strike since March12. According to news-service reports, the company has saidit has no intentions of declaring a force majeure and thatsuch talk is pure speculation. Mr. O'Neill says that unlessthe strike is over soon, he believes it inevitable that aforce majeure will be declared. &quot;The company is putting up agood front. But it's clear that they are running low onrefined copper,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just a question of time.&quot; Mr.O'Neill noted that shipments of copper out of Zambia havebeen picking up. The most recent cargo was for 13,400 tons,up from 10,600 tons the previous week. Michael Frawley, ametals trader at PaineWebber, New York, says he believes theproduction problems in Peru are fully discounted in themarket. He added that he thinks the strike in Peru will endsoon and the market has taken this into account. He alsonoted that the market has run into considerable priceresistance in the $1.20-a-pound area for the May contract,and that physical demand for copper in April has been largelysatisfied. However, he adds, &quot;If physical demand in May picksup, it could provide renewed strength to the market.&quot;                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures fellslightly amid reports that the harvest in Brazil is rapidlyapproaching the halfway point. Prices were also depressed bynews that lawmakers in Brazil approved a sweepinganti-inflation program. The program, if successful, wouldtake away the incentive for Brazilian farmers to hoard theirsoybean harvest. Analysts are speculating that farmers willbegin to sell their crop, which would increase the supply ofBrazilian soybeans for export. Brazil is a major competitorof the U.S. in the world soybean market. Prices of cornfutures fell slightly yesterday. Prices of soft red winterwheat contracts settled mixed at the Chicago Board of Trade.</TEXT></DOC>
