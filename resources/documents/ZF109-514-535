 Withpaper-intensive procedures, the flow of paper documents is a major factor indetermining the amount of time required to complete the processing ofinformation in an enterprise and thus to arrive at business decisions.andP;  Paperhandling lends itself to lost, misplaced, and misfiled documents (papers) andcan inject errors into a paper-intensive procedure.andP;  The ImagePlus [TM]system can improve the quality of the procedure by decreasing the number oferrors inherent in the handling of paper, thus improving the &quot;informationflow speed&quot; in a procedure.andP;  The timeliness with which information entersinto the decision support system is improved, leading to more timely businessdecisions.andM;Business procedures that involve assets such as contracts, invoices, legalrecords, patent and copyright records, or chemical records, for example,represent the revenue of a corporation.andP;  Handling such records in electronicform through image processing improves the quality of a procedure bydecreasing the number of misplaced or misfiled papers, and shortens the timefor accessing information from hours and days to seconds and minutes.andO;Electronic records also permit better management of procedures throughimproved auditing and automatic work flow.andM;The growth of business has been accompanied by increases in the volume ofpaper to the point where using paper has become an impediment to automatingthe business procedures any further.andP;  Processing a transaction often involvesthe use of one or more coded data, or computerized, applications inconjunction with paper documents.andP;  Using paper with coded data applicationsalso limits the possibilities for automation that are practical or that canbe justified for the coded data applications.andP;  ImagePlus provides not only acost-effective means of reducing or eliminating the use of paper, but it alsounlocks opportunities to improve the automation of associated coded dataapplications.andM;Numerous business procedures exist in IBM that involve the use of paper to avarying extent.andP;  Within IBM we are using the ImagePlus products to automatepaper-intensive portions of selected key-asset business procedures.andP;  Ourobjective is to improve user satisfaction by improving the efficiency andeffectiveness of these selected business procedures.andM;This paper contains a detailed description of several applications usedinside IBM for which an ImagePlus system has been ordered or installed.andP;  Theyinclude the contracts management application for the IBM US Marketing andamp;Services Business Systems Contract Management organization, the import andexport records management application for the International PurchasingOffice, the research and development application for IBM US Marketing andamp;Services Business Systems Research and Development, and theapplicant-for-employment records management application for PersonnelRecords.andM;ImagePlus internal use program objectives andandM;guidelinesandM;An ImagePlus internal use program (IUP) was set up in IBM during the earlyImagePlus product availability period.andP;  With the implementation of thisprogram, the following guidelines and objectives were established to ensurethat the product would be utilized in selected internal areas, or accounts,where the resources for its use were available.andM;The objective of the IUP is to have a means to work with users in internalorganizations to the point where the ImagePlus system is installed andrunning.andP;  At this point, their education and training is considered complete.andO;Thus, they can execute the phase of installation leading to full-scaleproduction on a regular basis and act as a focal point for image processingknowledge at their site and for the identification and implementation ofother ImagePlus applications.andM;Organizations selected must have executive-level support.andP;  Such support is acritical and necessary element to ensure that management is informed of theproject status and is responsible for commitments and expedient decisions.andM;Only key-asset line-of-business applications are selected.andP;  The efficiencyand effectiveness of these applications has an immediate and direct effect ondelivery of IBM products and services to IBM's customers, thus directlyaffecting customer satisfaction.andP;  Because these key-asset procedures areimportant, the measurements for the flow of their applications and the flowof paper within them are readily available.andP;  Having the measurementscontributes to the timeliness with which the justification can be completed.andO;These important applications are auditable at the overall procedure level andat the individual department level.andM;To meet these requirements, the individual departments keep a copy of theirinput and output in the form of paper document file folders.andP;  The file foldermay also contain papers that were used in decisions and that are necessaryfor the identification of audit trails.andP;  The file folder may further containcomputer printouts from coded databases, forms, image documents, signatures,and quality check-off sheets.andP;  The computer printouts are kept in the filefolder because the databases from which they were generated are large.andP;  Thus,archiving snapshots of the database is not cost-effective.andP;  An example ofsuch a database is one containing product prices.andM;The file folders are maintained in an organization referred to as a databank.andP;  The data bank also registers new documents and retrieves file folderson request.andP;  It has records management and retention responsibilities.andP;  Eachnew document coming into the organization is registered in the data bank.andO;This registration process may involve receiving mail from the mail room,opening the mail, removing the contents, visually scanning the document forcontent and then, based on content, keying the keywords as search argumentsinto a relational database.andP;  The system then records date, time, and point ofreceipt for the document.andP;  Next, the distribution list is determined on thebasis of document content and identifies the number of copies that are madeand distributed.andP;  Thus, the copies exit the data bank and enter into theactive work flow (also referred to as inprocess work) of the organization.andO;The original document is maintained in a file folder in the data bank wherecopies are provided upon request.andM;Organizations selected must have a paper-intensive procedure and the skilledresources necessary to cost-justify new products.andP;  Also, they must have theskilled resources to identify their procedure before and after the ImagePlusstarter system is installed and to install a prototype system and integrateit into their application.andP;  End-user procedure knowledge, I/S or systemintegration skills, and ImagePlus product knowledge and skills are requiredwithin the organization.andM;Account nomination and selection process.andP;  The following paragraphs identifythe activity and sequence of events we performed in starting up severalinternal IBM accounts.andP;  This process was developed through actual experienceand use.andM;Accounts interested in using ImagePlus first contact the IUP project manager.andO;In a telephone conversation the application is discussed and verified to be apotential ImagePlus application.andP;  An appointment is made to visit the site,meet the group that will be using the application, present a course onImagePlus, and tour the area where the application is thought to apply.andM;ImagePlus 101 is the name adopted for the course, which varies from one tofour hours, depending on the number of questions and the size of theaudience.andP;  The course is taken largely from chapter one of the IBM ImagePlusPresentation Guide [1] and from the IBM ImagePlus Justification Guide, thelatter of which is provided only to the internal accounts that will useImagePlus.andM;At the first meeting with the group, the IUP objectives and guidelines arepresented with the sequential steps that provide guidance on how to proceed.andO;The steps are identified in Appendix A.andP;  We ask the group to read chapter onein the presentation guide and to review the justification guide, whichcontains the forms and questions that assist in identifying the application,in presenting the business case, and in system sizing.andP;  These publicationshave proved to be an excellent aid in facilitating the teamwork that bringstogether the disciplines of system integration, project management, andapplication development and the end-user process knowledge for a particularbusiness application.andP;  As an example, some of the typical questions and formscontained within the justification guide address, from an end-user'sperspective, how many times a particular document is used and retrieved perday.andP;  From the system integration or I/S perspective, the questions translateinto system communications and storage requirements.andP;  At the end of thisvisit we tour the end-user work area for each of the potential applications.andM;By the end of the first visit, the group has been advised that thecost-justification phase is approaching and will require the time and talentof their organization.andP;  Therefore, management and executive support areneeded.andP;  Executive commitment is necessary to allocate the people resourcesfor each of the required disciplines and to anticipate purchasing anImagePlus system.andP;  People will be appointed to make up the ImagePlus projectteam.andP;  A team project manager is appointed and is responsible for allcommunications to the IUP program manager and for all communications withinthe team's own organization.andM;Throughout the application selection process we frequently review the keyImagePlus application selection list of questions that are given in AppendixB.andP;  This quick reference list of reminders was developed from actual use.andM;Over the next few weeks the people with the appropriate skills are selectedand form the ImagePlus project team.andP;  Then the second visit to the site isscheduled, by which time the team has reviewed the potential application,discussed its value to their organization, and obtained executive approvaland support.andP;  During the second visit we attempt to select a starting pointwithin the overall application.andP;  With procedures involving numerousdepartments, the purpose is to find when the paper documents first arrive inthe corporation.andP;  From this point of origin, the paper flow is briefly mappedthrough the departments to identify service units, to the point where thepaper processing is completed and the paper is archived.andP;  When the flow forthe procedure is completely determined, the most likely place to use theImagePlus starter system is identified within the overall procedure.andO;Typically, this system will replace the paper document file folders in thedata bank.andP;  This initial application is a starting point that serves to beproductive and to assist in putting the organization on a learning curve.andO;This prototype system is extendable (preserving the investment of theorganization) to provide for future requirements such as remotecommunications and new product and technology enhancements.andP;  At this pointthe major elements in the business case are known and quantified.andP;  TheImagePlus starter system is configured and sized.andP;  The business case iscomplete when executive approval is obtained.andP;  The information-gatheringactivity for individual elements within the business case is completed to acommon-sense level and is not an exhaustive exercise.andP;  The intent is to bringthe opportunity to a decision point in an expedient manner and to meet theneeds of the business.andM;Training is provided by the ImagePlus system design and implementationclasses and given to an end-user representative and technical representative,selected from the ImagePlus project team.andP;  These classes provide theopportunity for the students to verify their application.andM;The ImagePlus project team develops a system installation plan to ensure thatthe system is ordered and installed and that the physical environment meetsthe system requirements.andM;Most of the internal applications reviewed to date are characterized by endusers who are professional administrators.andP;  Judgment is used in their dailywork and may involve the use of one or more coded data applications.andP;  Theemphasis on the use of ImagePlus is to remove the drudgery from theend-users' work that is directly attributable to the handling, movement, andinherent delays in the use of paper.andP;  In this environment, the ImagePlusstarter system is first used to service a department.andP;  Then the departmentbecomes the teacher for the remainder of the organization.andP;  The automation ofa manual process within the organization becomes a standard for othermeasured and planned improvements.andM;Justification phase.andP;  During the justification phase we define the majorservice units within the current and new process, the major business caseelements, and the initial ImagePlus system topology.andM;We approach the process flow of an application from the view that paperrepresents key-asset information and that it flows through a process similarto that of goods on a production line.andP;  The output of the process, in theform of information, enters into the decision support system of theorganization and has value associated with it.andP;  With image processing, theinherent delays in the use of paper can be reduced or eliminated, thusimproving the timeliness of the decision support system and reducing the needto make risky decisions.andM;Our business cases emphasize the initial application and its displaceablecosts.andP;  The follow-on extensions to this system, as they relate to theapplication, are also developed in the form of scenarios or as a &quot;view of thefuture.&quot;andP;  This method provides assurance that the investment will bepreserved with new technology and application advancements; also, theseexercises provide the view of an initial investment to which logicalextensions can be made as they are developed.andM;The business case exercises have consisted of first identifying the objectiveelements, listed in Appendix C.andP;  This set of elements makes up thedisplaceable costs that are visible and easier to quantify than thesubjective elements.andP;  Following is an example of some major displaceableelements that were addressed.andM;* Reduction of on-site paper storage costs (Table 1): After the file folderis closed (processing is completed, and the folder comes off the active workqueue), such as when the conditions of a contract have been met, thefrequency of access will also decrease.andP;  For some period of time up to twoyears, the paper is kept on site.andP;  As this paper ages, its frequency ofaccess decreases, and it is moved to off-site storage.andP;  With ImagePlus,on-site paper storage is reduced or eliminated because the image data areavailable on line.andM;The time required to retrieve information on paper from the data bank can bedetermined by surveying the end user, and the frequency of retrieval isusually maintained in the statistics maintained by the data bank manager.andO;With ImagePlus the image data are available on line, thus reducing theretrieval costs and improving the rate of information flow.andM;* Reduction of off-site paper storage costs (Table 1): Paper files areusually archived off site but within close proximity to the place of businessfor speedy retrieval.andP;  If the place of business is in an area of high-costreal estate, paper storage costs are correspondingly high.andP;  With theavailability of on-line image data, the storage cost is reduced because thepaper can be maintained in an area of less expensive real estate when it isnecessary to keep the original paper.andP;  For applications in which it is notnecessary to keep the original paper, paper storage and retrieval costs areeliminated beginning at the point in the process where the paper is scanned.andM;Most line-of-business applications are under pressure for quick turnaroundtime, requiring the use of expensive overnight mail delivery to move papersquickly.andP;  Networks for transmission of image data may reduce these costs andimprove the rate of information flow.andM;In complex paper-flow processes it takes time to manually track down andlocate a piece of work that is in-process.andP;  With ImagePlus work-flowmanagement, the location of in-process work can be determined by a systemquery.andP;  As paper flows through the service units, completion is identified bya check mark on a paper or by making an entry into a relational database.andO;With ImagePlus this action is automatically performed by the system, completewith time stamps and routing information that is available for processmanagement reporting.andM;The above description is intended as an example of areas within the businesscase that we have considered.andP;  In most situations, the measurements for theobjective elements are already available or can be easily determined by asimple task analysis such as described in the following paragraph.andM;What is the length of time required to retrieve a contract from the databank?andP;  The subtasks are: walk to the data bank, complete a request form andplace it in the in-basket of the data bank, then return to the place of work.andO;After the designated data bank retrieval time has passed, return to the databank and obtain the copy, and return to the place of work.andM;If an organization can apply metrics to the value of information in relationto time for one of their operations, the improved rate of information flowcan also be used as an objective element in the business case.andP;  We have foundthis set of metrics to be application-dependent.andP;  To develop the scenariosfor these metrics, we use the question: What is the negative value of a losttransaction?andP;  In other words, what is the cost of a lost or misplaced invoiceor contract?andP;  The loss of the paper document is a direct loss of business andtherefore lost revenue.andP;  The question is, what is the value in improving theturn-around time for information, thereby improving the time within which theinformation is available for business decisions?andP;  Improved information flowcontributes to the quality of decisions, thereby reducing risk.andM;Our findings have determined that in processing applications organizations donot copy and archive a paper copy of the original paper.andP;  With ImagePlus, thekey-asset data can be archived on a second copy of the storage media andstored off site in a vault.andP;  Thus, the data management portion of thedisaster recovery system for an organization is improved.andM;Contract management application descriptionandM;The contract management business procedure of IBM's US Marketing andamp; Servicesorganization is responsible for the effective and efficient processing ofIBM's customer contracts.andP;  Figures 1, 2, and 3 depict an overview of termlease agreement (TLA) processing, which is the first production applicationusing ImagePlus within the contract management procedure.andP;  Figure 1illustrates today's paper process, and Figures 2 and 3 show use of ImagePlusfirst within the local term lease department and then as the strategic methodfor remote branch offices.andP;  The strategic system will not only provide termlease processing but will also provide a records management system andsupport numerous ImagePlus applications.andM;In today's business world one of the key drivers to continued success is theability to produce, distribute, process, retrieve, and store paperefficiently.andP;  IBM's contracts are produced, signed, processed, distributed,and retained as paper originals and copies.andP;  This paper process has become amajor inhibitor to business efficiency and growth.andP;  Paper volumes continue togrow with many duplicates stored in multiple locations.andP;  In addition, legalrequirements cause continued growth in storage and retrieval expenses.andO;ImagePlus promises to provide a cost-effective alternative and allowsContract Management to expand beyond the boundaries of where all of thispaper is located.andM;Business problem being solved.andP;  The Contract Management people began aneffort in August 1988 to identify methods to improve the distribution andretention of paper within their organization.andP;  To administer a typicalcustomer contract a paper file is created, which includes paper copies ororiginals of signed contracts, supplements, customer correspondence,invoices, and supporting documentation of any kind that might be needed toensure complete management.andP;  For most files these contracts are kept in thebranch offices that create them, and the information they contain isdifficult to access from other branch offices or locations.andP;  Data containedwithin the contract is loaded into data processing systems to trackfulfillment and to bill for products and services rendered.andM;In many cases, to provide control for key-asset procedures such as term leaseprocessing or for a national account where many branch offices may beinvolved, the complete paper file is mailed to a central headquartersdepartment for processing.andP;  In this case, a copy is maintained in the branchas well as in the headquarters department.andP;  Since the branch can no longerview the current file, good communications must exist to ensure timelyprocessing and notification.andM;The June 1988 announcement of ImagePlus provided the approach that was neededto truly revolutionize the way business information is stored and processed.andO;The advantages of ImagePlus are derived from the capability of storinginformation in its electronic form.andP;  It allows simultaneous access to thecorrect level of information for all users.andP;  Multiple copies are no longerneeded.andP;  Mail costs and delays are eliminated or reduced.andP;  All additions tothe image file are immediately available to all users.andP;  Multiple locationretention is no longer necessary, and the cost of paper storage is reduced oreliminated.andM;In addition, the processing workload can be balanced by allowing the filecontents to be worked on at many locations, not just at the location wherethe paper resides.andP;  Today, personnel must be moved to the paper to handlepeak workloads.andP;  The contracts management operation has unique workloads thatpeak at the end of each month and also during November and December of eachyear; thus the improved portability of the procedure can have high value.andM;Integration approach.andP;  The contracts management procedure spans manydifferent locations and organizations.andP;  We choose to start with a small partof the business procedure, preferably self-contained within one department,rather than integrate ImagePlus into the line of business, determine how bestto utilize it, and then put it into use globally.andM;The processing of term lease agreements or contracts was selected to providea pilot installation of ImagePlus.andP;  Activities of the procedure were reviewedin detail, and line-of-business personnel were involved to determine theapplicability of image processing for the line of business.andM;Term lease administration process description.andP;  Term lease administrationprovides administrative support for the IBM Credit Corporation, a whollyowned subsidiary of IBM that is a third-party financier.andP;  The application isdistributed across different locations and organizations.andP;  It begins in anIBM branch office, where customer proposals are negotiated by marketingrepresentatives.andP;  When a proposal is accepted, a contract is signed and thenpreprocessed by account administrators.andP;  This preprocessing consists ofproviding necessary information such as credit, pricing, and customerdemographic data.andP;  Once this information is assembled into a paper file, itis mailed to a centralized processing location.andM;The two key primary functions of term lease administration are to generateapplicable billing for all IBM Credit Corporation lease contracts andmaintain the contract files for all processed contracts.andP;  Major activitiesinclude time-stamping, logging receipt of contracts, providing billing,billing adjustment, accounts receivable processing, and management andstorage of the contract to the end of the lease, and finally, archiving thecompleted contract.andM;Measurement of the current business unit procedure.andP;  To establish a benchmarkmeasurement for performance improvement, the business procedure was mapped indetail with each activity timed.andM;After three months of using the pilot system at production level, withoutusing paper, each activity is timed and compared against the benchmark.andO;Performance improvement conclusions can then be drawn and a decision tocontinue with a global installation can be made.andM;Support structure.andP;  As with any data processing system, adequate support mustbe provided to ensure integrity of the line-of-business application.andP;  Plansshould address initial installation activity, configuration, performancetuning, system administration (security, database maintenance, andeducation), software maintenance, problem determination, data integrity(backup and recovery), and future system needs.andM;At the time of this writing, we had completed the upgrading of the ImagePlussystem to an Application System/400[R] (AS/400[TM]) to take advantage of newsoftware function and for the additional computing power.andP;  The upgrade wascompleted during January 1990, and we have begun to include additionalworkstations in the term lease organization.andM;IPODC Import Operations Services procedureandM;application descriptionandM;IBM's International Purchasing Office Distribution Center (IPODC) in Boulder,Colorado, has integrated an ImagePlus system solution into the import andexport records procedure application.andP;  This section describes the applicationand how we accomplished the objective of improving the efficiency andeffectiveness of this key-asset line-of-business application through the useof new technology.andM;IPODC is responsible for managing the business systems and operationalprocedures that process all import and export transactions for the IBMCorporation.andP;  This responsibility includes ensuring compliance with all U.S.andO;Customs regulations, tracking the movement of goods, triggering payment ofIBM's import/export brokers, ensuring correct tender for imported goods, andhandling the movement of household goods for employees embarking oninternational assignments.andP;  Figures 4 and 5 depict respectively the currentpaper-intensive process and the ImagePlus system that will serve as thesolution to our records management and control dilemma.andP;  ImagePlus willprovide an on-line records management system as well as automated work flowfor various departments that are downstream users of key-asset data.andM;IPODC is being driven toward a paperless environment by numerous requirementsof U.S.andP;  Customs, other governmental agencies, and various Business Partnersof IBM.andP;  Efforts are running in parallel in the area of electronic datainterchange in order to find the most efficient means of informationexchange.andP;  IPODC felt that ImagePlus would provide a significant solution tothe problem of paper proliferation within our line of business.andM;IBM's international trade business is an extremely paper-intensive operation.andO;For every import transaction, numerous paper documents are generated.andP;  Thesedocuments (e.g., commercial invoices, bills of lading, government regulatoryforms, etc.) are collected at IBM's broker locations and then forwarded toIPODC.andP;  If this paper-intensive procedure were left unchecked, it would causefuture problems in such areas as data integrity, data redundancy, storagespace, and accessibility.andP;  ImagePlus will provide a cost-efficientalternative to these problems.andM;Business problem being solved.andP;  In November 1988 IPODC started to identifymethods to improve the management and control of paper records.andP;  A typicalimport transaction was initiated by one of our brokers sending a &quot;copy&quot; ofall related documentation to the IPODC in Boulder.andP;  This package was &quot;copied&quot;and distributed to several functions within IPODC.andP;  After each of these areasperformed an activity on their respective piece of the package, the annotatedsections were sent back to the file room.andP;  Here the package was merged into a&quot;complete&quot; package.andP;  All of the documents were collected into a manila folderand stored on a shelf for future reference.andP;  Any group that wanted access toa particular folder or document had to submit a written request to the fileroom and then wait for a period ranging from 8 to 24 work hours.andP;  Once afolder was checked out, no one else had access to that particular folder.andO;Also, a folder would often be returned with missing or annotated documents.andO;In such a case, the file room would have to call the broker and requestanother copy of the respective document.andP;  ImagePlus allows information to bestored and retrieved as electronic images, and provides the capability toeliminate paper stored in hanging folders.andM;The planned objective for integrating image processing into the businessprocedure was to improve the capability to manage the procedure.andP;  In theelectronic representation of a paper document, its image can be viewedsimultaneously by all users.andP;  Also, multiple copies will no longer be needed,and mail costs and delays will be reduced or eliminated.andP;  Additions made tothe image file will be immediately available to all users, thus ensuring thatall users are employing the correct level of information for their process.andO;Entry package data integrity and control is assured through the capability ofthe ImagePlus systems to timestamp the entry package and all updates to theelectronic file.andP;  This capability also improves the audit trails and providesfor improved accessibility to the audit tracking and recording information.andO;The risk that would result from loss of valuable customs documentation hasbeen eliminated, and the information is accessible within minutes and secondscompared with the old process that provided access within hours or days.andP;  Ingeneral, we have found that the capability to manage the process has beenenhanced through the integration of new image processing technology into theline of business.andP;  Errors and delays that were injected into the old manualprocess by the handling and movement of large volumes of paper are eliminatedor reduced.andM;Integration approach.andP;  IPODC decided to install ImagePlus in a phased manner.andO;We chose to narrow the scope of the project to just the business unit forImport Operations Services and then provide installation over a period oftime to other IPODC business units.andM;IPODC Records, a business unit within Import Operations Services, had alreadyexpressed a need to &quot;automate&quot; their procedure and, as such, validated thetarget application for ImagePlus.andM;Our reasons for choosing to automate the import operations procedure was tocontrol the need to add more people for the records management tasks thatincreased each year with the growth and proliferation of paper.andM;A joint effort was initiated between Import Operations Services and IPODCArchitecture and Design.andP;  Work flow was analyzed, key activities identified,and service units profiled.andM;A decision was made initially to ignore cooperative processing since codeddata were presently available on the Import Data Management (IDM) businesssystem.andP;  These data would not be integrated into the ImagePlus electronicfolders as this integration appeared to be a duplication of data.andM;IPODC Import Operations Services process description.andP;  Import OperationsServices consists of three service units: IPODC Records, Import Operations,and Import Control.andM;IPODC Records currently files all entry packages that come from IBM's importtrade brokers as hanging folders in a file room.andP;  The entry packages arefiled according to entry package number.andP;  An entry package can containnumerous other documents (e.g., invoices, U.S.andP;  Customs 7501 forms, airwaybills, governmental agency forms, and any supplemental information thatmay be related to the aforementioned documents).andP;  Because of the nature ofthe import business, many people require access to these documents at varioustimes.andP;  The retrieval and distribution of entry package documents ispresently a manual and time-consuming process.andP;  The major problems are thetransmission of package components to requesting parties and the inability toretrieve an entire package without having to search through numerous on-linescreens of the current import business system (IDM).andM;Even after all of the applicable documentation has been secured from IDM, therequestor does not know if all of the data are accurate.andP;  This phenomenonresults from the fact that they do not have the &quot;hard copy,&quot; or paper,invoices available.andP;  Also, IDM cannot accommodate all of the annotations thatmay be attached to a paper invoice.andP;  This restriction results in additionalwork being done to get the hard copy invoice in order to validate the data.andM;The mission of Import Control is to ensure that each import transaction wasconducted in accordance with guidelines defined by various governmentalagencies.andP;  U.S.andP;  Customs originates the vast majority of all guidelines withwhich Import Control checks on compliance.andP;  Import Control receives directionfrom the Import Compliance Services.andP;  This latter business unit is inconstant contact with governmental agencies in Washington, DC, and makescertain that IPODC has processes in place that will assure compliance withgovernmental regulations.andM;The key functions performed by the Import Control area are verification,adjustment, and records management.andP;  Verification is the process of comparingthe data that a broker enters into the import business system with thecorresponding data listed on commercial invoices that pertain to an entrytransaction.andP;  The verification process ensures that the imported goods werevalued correctly, the amount tendered to customs was correct, and the amountthat the site was billed is correct.andP;  The adjustment process is initiatedwhen a discrepancy between the IDM invoice and the site billing is manifestedduring verification.andP;  In general, all adjustment activity is researched bythe sites and reflected on the hard-copy billings, and the updateddocumentation is sent back to IPODC in Boulder.andP;  The updated documentationmay result in an additional amount tendered to customs or the filing of apetition for an overpayment of duties.andM;Records management is the responsibility of the IPODC Records business unitand is implemented through the maintenance of a file room at IPODC.andP;  Thisgroup keeps all entry packages that have completed the verification processand, if necessary, the adjustment process.andP;  These packages are indexed byentry number and consist of hanging folders.andP;  Once the package has beenfiled, Records services all requests for either entry packages or individualdocuments or both that are contained within folders.andM;Import Operations Services is part of a larger conglomerate at IPODC.andP;  Thisgroup, along with the other business units, provides a centralized center ofcompetency that supports the importation process within IBM.andP;  This centeralleviates each company site or vendor from having to have an analogous localgroup.andP;  Thus, IBM realizes efficiencies by eliminating redundant function,providing consistency, and assuring compliance with U.S.andP;  Customs regulationsregarding the importation of goods into the United States.andM;The key input to Import Operations Services is an entry package.andP;  Thispackage is an aggregate entity that contains a number of documents, but theprimary documents that it contains are commercial invoices and U.S.andP;  Customs7501 forms.andM;There may be other documents in an entry package, depending on the origin ofthe goods, nature of the goods, and method of shipment.andP;  Documents may berequired by various governmental agencies such as the FCC, EPA, FDA, etc.andO;These documents are collectively referred to as other governmental agency(OGA) forms.andP;  Entry packages originate at IBM broker locations and are mailedvia an air express service to IPODC daily.andP;  Once the entry package arrives,IPODC Records makes copies of its contents and distributes documents to otherbusiness units in IPODC.andM;The primary output that Import Operations Services produces is a verifiedentry package.andP;  The verified package is filed in the file room as a hangingfolder that is indexed by entry number.andM;During 1987 approximately 39 000 entry packages were mailed to IPODC fromvarious broker locations.andP;  On average, each entry package contains 11 piecesof paper, indicating that about 430 000 pieces of paper were handled by IPODCduring that year.andP;  The volume grew in 1988 to approximately 45 000 packages.andO;It is projected that the number of packages will grow to 50 000 packages in1990 and stay constant in subsequent years.andM;Presently the Import Control group consists of over 35 people.andP;  Approximately20 of these are devoted to the maintenance of the file room.andP;  They arededicated to filing, retrieving, and distributing entry package documents tovarious requestors within IPODC or at IBM sites.andP;  A typical request for oneor more documents may take anywhere from 15 minutes to one day to satisfy,depending on whether the documentation is hand-delivered or delivered viainternal mail.andP;  On the average, information is only unavailable about 20percent of the time because of its absence from a file folder.andM;Access to entry package data is obtained by either physically passing apackage among personnel or copying and mailing needed documents.andM;Import Data Management (IDM) is the business system of record for all importactivity within the IBM Corporation.andP;  This application is based on theInformation Management System (IMS) and runs under the Multiple VirtualStorage (MVS) operating system.andP;  All import activity is processed through theIDM system.andP;  Embedded in IDM are such entities as tariff rates, letter ofcredit data, and invoice data.andP;  For the importation of goods IDM calculates,among other things, the applicable duties.andP;  All of the key application areaswithin IPODC utilize the IDM system to reconcile import transactions.andM;Import Control uses IDM to match commercial invoice data that the brokersenter on the original commercial invoices.andP;  The different sites utilize theIDM system to reconcile their ledger entries to commercial invoice data.andO;This process is performed to ensure that nothing was done that would changethe amount of duty paid by the broker at the time he or she secured therelease of goods.andP;  A transaction is initiated in the IDM system when thebroker opens an entry number and enters commercial invoice data into thesystem.andP;  After all of the invoice data are entered, an entry summary (U.S.andO;Customs form 7501) is printed via IDM.andP;  The entry summary and any otherrelevant forms are sent as an entry package to IPODC where they are furtherprocessed.andM;Figure 6 illustrates the process flow through the major functions of theImport Operations Services area.andP;  Figure 7 illustrates the process flow wedefined for the integration of ImagePlus.andM;Executive commitment.andP;  When ImagePlus was chosen as the solution, a businesscase was developed, approval obtained for capital commitment, and equipmentprocured for the Phase I system.andP;  This consisted of an IBM System/36 hostprocessor, a 9246 optical library unit, and five PS/2 Model 70 workstationsfor image processing.andP;  This system was the prototype used to validate theprocess changes and approach to the integration of ImagePlus with the processwe developed.andP;  During January 1990 we upgraded to an AS/400 for the increasedsoftware function and computing power.andP;  The AS/400 came into the first stageof production during January 1990 and replaced the use of the library (paper)and provided work flow for a departmental audit function.andM;Since January we have added workstations to bring other departments on line(Figure 8).andP;  These 49 workstations are necessary to recognize the full valueof ImagePlus for the line of business.andM;For its applications, the IPODC organization plans to attach remoteworkstations to the AS/400 for scanning and communicating with the brokersand for communicating with numerous IBM sites.andP;  Their experiences in workingwith this exciting new image technology have provided them with hands-onexperience.andP;  They plan to work with the other application organizations andserve as image consultants to assist them in enabling their applications toincorporate images.andM;Business Systems Research and DevelopmentandM;application descriptionandM;Business Systems Research and Development is comprised of approximately 200people.andP;  Their mission is to provide applied research and development supportto IBM's US Marketing andamp; Services organization.andP;  The mission includesopportunity analysis, technical assessments, prototype development andenabling, systems integration, and operations.andM;To pursue this mission aggressively, this organization has developed abusiness procedure and operating environment that is unique.andP;  As a researchand development site, it is important to establish the scope of the workperformed.andP;  The typical research and development cycle has six steps orphases (Figure 9).andM;The major portion of activity falls in the explore, investigate, andprototype steps.andP;  Occasionally, when the organization is &quot;uniquely qualified&quot;or is the &quot;developer of choice,&quot; work is performed in the develop, implement,or support steps.andM;Primarily, the business of the organization is matching technologies tobusiness opportunities and capitalizing on the synergism.andP;  They havedeveloped a matrix concept that proves to be a useful paradigm forcommunicating their procedure and managing the selection process.andM;Opportunities are plotted on the horizontal axis of the matrix.andP;  To identifyan opportunity the collect information on the business, such as strategies,executive requests, field visits, task analysis, and the results ofprototypes, from a variety of sources.andP;  They identify areas of opportunitythat can significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of marketingand service.andM;Data gathering done over the past year has focused on opportunities in thefollowing areas:andM;* Customer contact qualityandM;* Competitive advantageandM;* Information overloadandM;* Business procedure qualityandM;* Business procedure productivityandM;Technologies.andP;  Technologies are plotted on the vertical axis of the matrix.andO;The word &quot;technology&quot; is used in the broadest sense.andP;  It can be hardware,software, a discipline or procedure, or even a science, such as behavioralscience.andM;A technology watch is maintained to monitor, understand, and advance thestate-of-the-art in the following areas: automated operations,communications, data management, decision support, development productivity,human-machine interface, management science, office systems, andworkstations.andM;A common theme is held in assessing technology, that is, an orientationtoward the end user.andM;Mapping opportunities and technologies.andP;  After an opportunity-technologymatch is made, the prototype development step begins.andM;It was found that &quot;prototyping&quot; has many different definitions, leading tosome confusion in the I/S community.andP;  For clarification, the followingdefinitions are provided:andM;* Proof viability prototype or research prototype--This prototype may beeither a &quot;paper&quot; prototype or a demonstrable prototype.andP;  It providesdirection for further applied research and displays credible solutions to theproblem.andM;* Field prototype--This prototype displays good performance based onevaluation in the users' environment.andP;  It provides direction for solving theproblem and provides data for a business assessment/case.andM;* Production prototype--The prototype exhibits high quality and reliability,and satisfactorily solves the problem in the users' environment.andP;  It providestactical relief while the overall business process is updated.andM;Prototype development is an iterative process as used here.andP;  In closecooperation with the user, the application is placed in a test environmentwhere experience gained can be built on.andP;  Quite often the prototype developerand the typical user work together, trying various approaches until a goodsolution to the opportunity is found.andM;System development and integration.andP;  In the recent past, projects weredeveloped that provided an advanced solution not easily implemented in thecurrent operating environment.andP;  For instance, to demonstrate the validity ofthe remote support development effort, the Research and Developmentorganization installed a data processing complex to remotely operate 12 areainformation centers for IBM's National Service Division.andP;  This operation hasbeen an IBM showcase, serving as host to over 145 customer visits in an18-month period.andP;  This operation has been refined, and the remote operationsproduction system has been transferred to the IBM Lexington I/S site.andM;Business Systems Image Technology Project Office.andP;  An image is &quot;noncodeddata&quot; on paper, and in that form it is most used in the office environment.andO;Text, signatures, company logos, and other markings on paper are in noncodedform.andM;Image technology, although not new, is now considered affordable in an officeenvironment.andP;  The cost of memory and storage devices has been steadilydecreasing, whereas the cost of office space and personnel has continued torise.andP;  These two factors now make an image management system a viablesolution to a business opportunity.andM;Business Systems Research and Development sees this as anopportunity-technology match.andP;  They have commissioned a project office topromote the understanding and the use of image technology within the IBM USMarketing andamp; Services organization.andM;As with all projects in Business Systems Research and Development, the focusfor image technology will be on the human-machine interface and the effectson the business environment.andM;Working with the term lease agreement process owner, they supported ananalysis to establish a benchmark study.andP;  This analysis provides a referencepoint for the time it takes today to process the paper copy of the agreement.andO;From that, an assessment of the impact the ImagePlus application has on theprocess when fully implemented can be made.andM;The human-machine interface is also of particular importance to thebehavioral science department in the Research and Development group.andP;  Imageprocessing will have a direct impact on the productivity of the term leaseagreement process, as well as a potential impact on the individual performingthe task.andM;The behavioral science department utilizes a modeling technique called the&quot;system of work.&quot;andP;  This model was developed by Dr. Frank Hawkenshire, formerchief scientist for the Knowledge Engineer Curriculum (1983 to 1985), whileunder contract with IBM (Figure 10).andM;All aspects of the environment are taken into consideration: the person, thetask, the tools used, and the social and physical setting.andP;  This approach, ortechnique, for looking at the way all of these aspects play on one anotherhas brought success in several prototypes and production systems developed bythe Research and Development group.andM;Personnel Record management applicationandM;descriptionandM;Applications for employment are submitted to the personnel department of asite.andP;  The procedure in this case is represented by a file folder containingprevious work history, letters of reference, resume, diplomas, educationhistory, college records, and application for employment for each candidateapplying for a position.andP;  The file folder increases in size as the candidateis selected for interviews and for an offer.andP;  Initially the average size ofthe folder is 10 pages.andP;  As the candidate proceeds through the selectionprocess, the folder size increases to an average of 30 pages.andM;Approximately 15000 applications are processed each year.andP;  The folders arestored on site for one year in 15 five-drawer file cabinets, and then theyare stored in records retention.andM;The benefits offered by image processing are to improve the turnaround timefor candidate selection and to eliminate time-consuming paper-handling,provide concurrent on-line access to multipe recruiters and administrators,and improve information availability by eliminating lost or misplacedfolders.andM;An AS/400 ImagePlus system with 13 workstations and a stand-alone opticaldrive has been ordered with installation of workstations in each personneldepartment planned to occur during the second quarter of 1990.andM;Concluding remarksandM;In the course of our application definitions and justification exercises, wedevelop a &quot;view of the future&quot; for each application.andP;  We would like to sharethese views as examples, in the form of application and technologyenhancements.andM;A current records management system (RMS) uses a relational database that isprimed with keywords that have been typed into the system.andP;  The keywords aretypically determined by reading the content of a document and are then keyedinto the system.andP;  Also, the paper document is stored in a file cabinet or boxfor retrieval on demand based on business needs, and its location isidentified in the RMS for retrieval purposes.andP;  With ImagePlus the paper canbe scanned into the system so that the RMS contains the actual document andnot simply a pointer to its physical location.andP;  As technology advances andbecomes practical, the addition of optical character recognition (OCR), formsprocessing, scanning, and indexing processes content will provide thescanning and indexing processes with application enablers for the use ofartificial intelligence and knowledge-based systems in the coded dataapplication and in the image application.andP;  Scanning can be intelligentlydriven by document content that identifies relational database searcharguments.andP;  The coded data application information can also be available tothe RMS, in conjunction with the image data.andP;  Given this type of RMS andassuming a line-of-business application such as contracts management, we canask a question such as: How many widgets did we sell to company X in the 199Xto 199Y timeframe?andP;  This type of query would create a new electronic filefolder on-the-fly that can be printed, displayed, or further refined incontent.andM;Key-asset line-of-business information and applications will have auditrequirements.andP;  The auditing process can become another contender on the queuefor paper file folders.andP;  With ImagePlus, users can concurrently access thesame copy and have assurance that they are all using the same image.andP;  As afirst stage of automated auditing, the auditing can be accomplished through aworkstation.andP;  As a second stage of automation, the auditing can be enhancedthrough the use of knowledge-based systems for the purpose of removing theburden of mundane decisions from the person performing the audit.andM;We view OCR and bar-code recognition as application enablers.andP;  With OCR theconverted image data can be intelligently interrogated for keywords andstrings that can be stored in a relational database for retrieval purposes.andO;In this application of OCR, the cost of entering new documents into the imagesystem would be reduced.andM;Within an organization the value of having &quot;one copy&quot; in the recordsmanagement system can be a significant improvement in quality for theprocess.andP;  With paper, multiple copies of different levels of information areavailable because they are kept for reference material by individuals.andP;  Withimage processing, the same level of information is simultaneously availableto all users; thus the quality of information available to an organizationcan be improved.andM;The arrival of cost-effective image technology may be the best opportunitythat has occurred in the last three decades for the improvement of ourbusiness processes.andP;  The challenge of this future is viewed with excitementand enthusiasm because the possibilities are limited only by the imaginationitself.andP;  We live in an age where the basic system building blocks havematured to the point where technology provides for anything to be &quot;wiredtogether.&quot;andP;  Thus the next challenge is the question: At what cost?andM;Appendix A: Getting startedandM;* Visit customer's siteandM;* Introduce IBM ImagePlus Presentation GuideandM;- One-to-four-hour presentationandM;- Read Section OneandM;- Read the ImagePlus Justification GuideandM;- Tour end-users' work areaandM;* Establish project ownership and commitmentandM;- Obtain management and executive supportandM;- Establish communications focal pointandM;* Gain an understanding of the full scope of the applicationandM;- Find the origin of the paperandM;- Identify work-flow characteristicsandM;- Learn when the paper is archivedandM;- Identify coded data applicationsandM;* Determine a starting pointandM;- Define the minimum functional requirements (scan, index, file folder, workflow, display, print) for a starter systemandM;* Complete the ImagePlus Justification GuideandM;* Obtain approval for accountandM;* Attend ImagePlus system design classandM;- Validate selected solution and system configurationandM;* Develop installation planandM;- Place orderandM;- Assess physical environmentandM;- InstallandM;All of these items lead to the maxim, &quot;Get on the learning curve through thework itself.&quot;andM;Appendix B: ImagePlus application identificationandM;questionsandM;* What is the paper flow in your application or line of business?andM;* Is paper all or part of the input to your process?andM;* Is your process a key asset?andM;* If your archive is a key asset, do you have multiple copies for disasterrecovery?andM;* Is your paper-driven process accompanied by a coded data application?andM;* What is the interface between these papers or documents and users,microfilm systems, and the I/S system?andM;* Where are these papers stored?andP;
