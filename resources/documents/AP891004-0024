Manyrefugees were injured.   The desperate struggle came hours before East Germany sought tocurb the exodus of refugees on Tuesday, banning its citizens fromtraveling to Czechoslovakia without a visa.   However, East Germany also decided Tuesday to permit the about10,000 East Germans around the embassy compound to emigrate to theWest.   Hundreds of East Germans overturned a police barricade andscaled facades, rooftops or a 6-foot spiked fence in an effort toreach the crowded embassy compound, which had been closed earlierTuesday.   Police swung their nightsticks and ``clubbed like mad,'' oneCzechoslovak witness reported. Many refugees were leftblood-spattered.   More people from the waiting crowd surged toward where thebeatings took place. Refugees quickly built ``a human ladder'' tohelp many clear the fence, witnesses said.   Some became caught on the fence's sharp spikes, while othersjumped or fell head-first to the ground. Some were later seen lyingunconscious inside the compound, the witnesses said.   Outside the embassy, families with small children were unable toget inside.   ``This is pandemonium,'' said a Red Cross assistant handlinginjured refugees on the embassy grounds.   Thousands of other East Germans had packed into the embassygrounds earlier, and Red Cross officials feared sanitation problems.   Later Tuesday, young men were seen climbing the embassy facadefrom a truck. Refugees inside the compound pulled them in throughwindows.   The crowd of East Germans flocking to the embassy continued toswell during the day. More newcomers joined them after dark,shivering in freezing weather as their promised departure by EastGerman trains was delayed.</TEXT></DOC>
