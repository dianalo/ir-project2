The prisoners freed today did notinclude Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a leader of Shiite group Hezbollah, who waskidnapped by Israeli authorities in 1989 as a bargaining chip.;   The movescould help build confidence of Israeli willingness to participate in a swapinvolving the 11 Western hostages, captured Arab guerrillas and seven missingIsraeli servicemen. Israel has sought proof of the whereabouts of theservicemen or their remains.;   &quot;We took this initiative for humanitarianreasons and as proof of our willingness to make a gesture, hoping that such aninitiative will get a response from the parties involved -- those holding someof our soldiers and some of the Israeli soldiers,&quot; the South Lebanon Armycommander, Col. Antoine Lahad, told the Voice of South Lebanon radio.;   &quot;Wehope they will do the same as we did for humanitarian reasons, and we hopethat our initiative will help Perez de Cuellar to succeed in his attempts torelease all the POWs and the innocent kidnap victims, who were kidnapped inrecent years,&quot; Lahad said.;   Perez de Cuellar's two-day visit included talkswith President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who has urged an end to the hostagecrisis.;   He also planned today to meet with families of Iranians missing inLebanon.
