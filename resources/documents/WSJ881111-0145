On a current cost basis, which values the company's oil inventories at existing rather than historic acquisition prices, net rose 22% to #402 million from #330 million last year. Third-quarter sales fell to #6.69 billion from #7.43 billion a year earlier   The results generally topped market forecasts and follow better-than-expected results earlier yesterday from the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. BP, which is more dependent on &quot;upstream&quot; activities, or oil and gas exploration and production, than Royal Dutch/Shell, was hurt more from weaker crude prices during the latest quarter. But results from its petrochemicals division were strong, putting the sector's operating profit at a record high for the first nine months.    The quarter's profit picture was also brightened by one-time gains on the sale in July of stakes in the Ninian and Columba North Sea oil fields to London andamp; Scottish Marine andamp; Ranger Oil Ltd. for $138.5 million.    &quot;The decline in world crude oil prices continues to be a major influence on the short-term profitability of the oil industry,&quot; BP said, putting the blame on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)'s inability to control its members' production. For conditions to improve, BP said &quot;a new initiative on {OPEC} production quotas is required.&quot;    The company calculated its average North Sea oil price for the first nine months at $15.40 a barrel, down $3.20 from a year earlier.    Net for the first nine months fell 17% to #938 million from #1.13 billion last year. Sales for the period dropped to #19.68 billion from #21.46 billion.    BP calculated the effect of stock losses due to declining oil prices on the nine-month net to be #200 million, compared with a #272 million-gain a year earlier.    U.K. upstream results were fattened by an #81 million-profit on the sale of the North Sea interests. That lifted operating profit on exploration and production in the U.K. before adjustment for inventory losses to #195 million in the latest quarter, up from #162 million a year earlier. For the nine months, operating profit there was up by a slim #2 million to #471 million.    Operating profit on upstream activities in the U.S., however, declined in the quarter to #215 million from #379 million and was off in the nine months at #644 million from #973 million a year earlier.    Refining and marketing results generally showed a sharp improvement in the period, as depressed oil prices helped increase margins on petroleum product sales. In the U.K. and continental Europe, the quarter's operating profit on downstream business was #58 million, reversing a #21 million-loss a year earlier. The nine-month period saw operating profit push ahead modestly to #102 million from #100 million last year.    In the U.S., refining and marketing contributed #98 million to the quarter's operating profit, double the #48 million of last year. For the nine months, operating profit rose to #230 million from #157 million pounds.    &quot;U.S. refining margins were particularly firm in the third quarter due to strong motor spirit {gasoline} demand,&quot; BP noted.    The decline in total upstream profit, to #403 million in the quarter from #556 million, and sales, to #1.60 billion from #1.81 billion, came despite a slight rise in sales volume and increased production. BP said it produced 1.71 billion barrels of oil world-wide during the latest three months compared with 1.53 billion barrels a year earlier.    Sales of natural gas were up sharply, totaling #1.09 billion, compared with #589 million in the year-earlier quarter.    BP's petrochemical unit, benefiting from continued strong demand for bulk supplies, saw operating profit more than double to #122 million from #54 million in the latest quarter. The #382 million in profit for the first nine months, up from #152 million last year, was a record for the period, the company said.    Minerals, whose results also set a record for the nine months, tripled contributions to operating profit in the nine-month period to #180 million from #46 million. In the quarter, profit jumped by a similar proportion to #62 million from #19 million. </TEXT></DOC>
