A few dozen California pet groomers who provide this service for about $5 a dog say there is a veterinarian-backed conspiracy to drive them out of the dog tooth-care business. The veterinarians, who get about $100 for dog-tooth cleaning, say that allowing pet groomers to clean dogs' teeth is like letting hairdressers perform surgery.    Some state officials are so adamant that dogs' teeth should be cleaned only by licensed veterinarians that they sent in an undercover pooch a couple of months ago to break up what they considered an illegal dog-tooth cleaning operation.    Patti Alexander, the Stockton, Calif., groomer and dog-tooth cleaner who was issued a civil citation in the sting, promptly sued the state, noting that there was absolutely nothing in the state's business or veterinary-medicine codes prohibiting groomers from cleaning dogs' teeth.    &quot;It was a cockapoo (a cocker spanielpoodle mix), and it didn't even need its teeth cleaned,&quot; says Ms. Alexander.    This all got tossed into the lap of a Superior Court judge in San Joaquin County, who ruled two weeks ago that there is no wrongdoing in brushing, flossing or even scraping a dog's teeth with metal dental instruments. The judge, however, did grant a state-sought injunction prohibiting groomers from using ultrasonic tooth-cleaning devices, or metal scrapers above or below the gumline.    Explains Gary Hill, executive director of the state's Board of Examiners in Veterinary Medicine: Groomers who invade a dog's gums &quot;are practicing medicine&quot; and might cause the dog unnecessary pain. Mr. Hill's agency, which initiated the action against Ms. Alexander, has proposed new rules making it illegal for groomers to use most dental tools.    Meanwhile, 2,000 citizens have signed a petition supporting the groomers for providing what Ms. Alexander calls &quot;a public service.&quot;    The size of the dog-tooth cleaning business is hard to estimate. But a good dog-tooth cleaner can easily see a hundred patients a month. There also are 3,000 veterinarians in California -- including a few who specialize in dog dentistry.    The groomers and veterinarians do agree on one thing: Dogs that get their teeth cleaned regularly have &quot;fresher breath,&quot; says Ms. Alexander's lawyer, Michael Small. </TEXT></DOC>
