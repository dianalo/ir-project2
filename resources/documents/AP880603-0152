Bush ``wished Duarte well and expressed his gratitude for whatDuarte's done for democracy,'' a spokeswoman for the vicepresident, Kristin Taylor, said.   Bush arrived at Andrews Air Force Base late this morning,following a week's stay at his Maine vacation home, and thenimmediately boarded a helicopter for the short trip to Walter Reed.   Duarte, one of the United States' staunchest allies in LatinAmerica, remains in guarded but stable condition as his doctorsreview test results to determine how best to treat the stomach andliver cancer, the hospital said in a statement today.   The hospital said that doctors at Walter Reed and Duarte'spersonal physician would look at all the test results and ``presenttreatment alternatives to the president and his family.'' Thehospital added that ``no decision on treatment is expected orrequired today'' and did not specify when a decision would be made.   Duarte, 62, entered Walter Reed on Tuesday night. He visited aspecial clinic on Thursday for magnetic resonance imaging tests todetermine the extent of his cancer.   On his return to Walter Reed on Thursday, he spoke briefly withreporters, telling them, ``I feel well.''   He later added, ``One thing is assured. I'll fight it outbecause I believe in God.''   In a statement Thursday, Walter Reed said Duarte has a malignantgastric ulcer and that preliminary tests showed ``some liverinvolvement,'' but that no further spread of the cancer had beendetected.   Duarte's personal physician, Benjamin Interiano, who is from ElSalvador, said Thursday that he is optimistic for Duarte eventhough ``it's a very difficult situation, medically speaking. If aperson has decided to fight, I have all hopes.''   Interiano said he did not know how long the Salvadoran presidentwould remain hospitalized in the United States. But he describedDuarte's condition as ``very guarded.''   The magnetic resonance imaging tests, or MRI, were done at theoffices of Magnetic Imaging of Washington. The company uses MRI totake three-dimensional pictures of soft tissue. The tests candetect differences in the magnetic fields of tissues that cannot beseen by X-rays and is useful in detecting cancers.   Duarte spoke in Spanish and English, with his Spanish remarksinterpreted by Ambassador Ernesto Rivas-Gallont.   One comment he made in Spanish but did not repeat in Englishwas: ``I leave a message for my country that they should never losethe liberty they have now.''   Duarte's son, Alejandro Duarte, said he did not have anyimmediate concerns about the political stability of El Salvadorduring his father's absence.   ``The government is a team,'' he said in remarks translated intoEnglish by the ambassador. ``A team is together, united. Obviously,fundamental policies won't change.   ``We still don't know how long the president will be away.Therefore, we cannot say how his absence will affect the(long-term) conduct of government.''   Duarte is in the final year of his five-year term.</TEXT></DOC>
