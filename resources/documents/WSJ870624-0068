The computers serve as the eyes and ears for the Los Angeles-class attack submarine. A sonar system, made by International Business Machines Corp., is on its third modernization and can sift in a few seconds oceanic information that used to take hours to decipher. The system is part of an undersea arsenal of high-tech systems nurtured through two decades of Navy research and tens of billions of dollars of investment.    But despite the highly sophisticated equipment, Navy leaders are increasingly worried about the U.S. capacity to detect what lurks underwater. The reason: The Soviet Union is making faster strides in quieting its submarines than the U.S. is making in designing systems to detect them.    Indeed, as the two superpowers negotiate reductions in nuclear forces, the U.S. and Russian navies are locked in a costly undersea arms race that has become one of the more intense military competitions of the next decade. &quot;It's one of the great technological fights going on in the world right now,&quot; says Adm. William Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Both superpowers are pouring money into anti-submarine warfare, and both are finding that the investments are quickly offset by developments on the other side.    &quot;The race goes on all the time,&quot; says Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, &quot;and we can't let them get ahead.&quot;    The U.S. Navy says it will need about $100 billion over the next 10 or 20 years for a new fleet of attack submarines. The Navy also wants a new batch of submarine-hunting airplanes to deploy around the world, plus billions of dollars of improved detection equipment.    Despite the rising expenditures, the Navy doesn't have any clear prospects of reversing the trends military planners find so alarming. The Navy's costly new attack submarines, to come on line in the 1990s, will have a harder time tracking Russian subs than was once assumed. In addition, the production line for sub-hunting airplanes is likely to shut down in coming months, and the Navy's plans for buying a new generation of aircraft have shifted repeatedly and are still in flux. The upshot will be a smaller fleet of the aircraft in the 1990s at a time when the Soviet undersea fleet will be more capable than ever.    The Soviets are testing or producing nine separate classes of submarines. Since 1983, the Russians have deployed four new classes of submarines, which the U.S. has dubbed the Mike, the Sierra, the Yankee SSN and the Akula. The numbers are impressive, but it is the silence of the Russian boats that is causing the most worry in the Pentagon. In the estimation of a research team at Lockheed Corp., the newest of these submarines are only 1% as noisy as the relatively clunky boats the Russians built just 10 years ago.    Some skeptics charge that the Navy's warnings are partly a ploy to get bigger budgets. &quot;Certainly, Soviet subs have gotten quieter,&quot; says Steven Kosiak, an analyst with the Center for Defense Information, &quot;but if you look at what their whole inventory is made up of today, it's a lot of pretty noisy attack submarines.&quot;    Still, there is no question that the newer Soviet subs are quieter, and Navy officials attribute that to hundreds of improved engineering techniques, such as ways of suspending pipes or installing cables, rather than any particular pieces of high-tech equipment. But some of those changes, Navy officials say, may have been based on information from the espionage ring led by convicted spy John Walker, a retired submariner who enlisted his son and a friend in his spying activities.    Says former Navy Secretary John Lehman: &quot;Largely because of the Walker disclosures, we've seen the Soviets close the submarine gap in quieting and other aspects of anti-submarine warfare, and at a faster rate than we predicted.&quot;    Alluding to the surprisingly quiet Akula sub, a Navy officer remarks, &quot;They ought to call it the Walker.&quot;    Even as U.S. strategists assess the damage from the Walker spy scandal, they have been socked by another big security breach: Kongsberg Vaapenfrabrik, a state-controlled Norwegian concern, and Japan's Toshiba Corp. teamed up to sell a Leningrad shipyard the know-how for building vastly quieter submarine propellers.    Together, the two schemes have significantly helped the Russian Navy shrink the superiority that U.S. submarines have long enjoyed. &quot;The Walkers told them what some of their problems were, and these guys sold them a way to fix them,&quot; says a senior Pentagon official.    Defense Department officials want the Reagan administration to demand that the governments of Norway and Japan help the U.S. foot the bill for regaining its edge in submarine technology. However, military officials concede the near impossibility of setting a price on the Kongsberg-Toshiba deal. Altogether, the Navy wants to spend $1.7 billion researching submarine warfare in fiscal 1988, which begins next October. No one can say how much of that will go to offsetting the loss of the propeller technology.    Wherever the Soviets may have come by their technology, their quieter submarines may complicate U.S. war-fighting plans. A fleet of about 36 missile-bearing submarines is designed to hide in the ocean, ready to fire nuclear missiles toward prime Soviet targets upon orders from the president. The security of the U.S. submarines depends on hearing and then evading Soviet subs trying to sneak up on them. A larger fleet of 97 attack submarines is designed to locate, track and torpedo Soviet ballistic-missile subs before they can launch their warheads at U.S. targets.    If the entire Soviet submarine fleet eventually becomes as quiet as the U.S. fleet, &quot;it's a whole new ball game,&quot; warns Adm. Bruce DeMars, the deputy chief of naval operations for submarine warfare. &quot;Our ability to go into their water and get a good kill ratio comes into question.&quot; Specifically, the quieter enemy subs could more easily approach U.S. attack boats and destroy them first.    Adm. DeMars stresses that the U.S. has long counted on having a quieter submarine fleet to offset the numerical advantages maintained by the Soviets. When diesel-power submarines are included along with nuclear-powered ones, Russian subs outnumber U.S. counterparts by a three-toone ratio, he says.    To counter the changing undersea threat, Navy researchers are studying new ways of detecting enemy submarines. One possibility being discussed is the design of an &quot;ear in the ocean.&quot; This would be a powerful listening post stationed on the ocean floor to pick up ship movements for hundreds of miles around. The problem with such posts -- there would presumably be a number of them around the world -- is their vulnerability to attack.    The Naval Underwater Systems Laboratory in Newport, R.I., is studying so-called active sonar devices, which project pulses out into the ocean and listen for the sound waves to bounce off targets and come back. Since the early 1960s, the Navy has relied mostly on passive sonar systems, which listen to sound waves in the ocean; using data-processing equipment, these systems separate the sounds of ship propulsion from the myriad other noises of the ocean depths.    Active sonar devices add to the likelihood that a submarine will give its position away, although making the sound projections at a very low frequency can lessen the risk. But low-frequency active sonar systems are bulky. Several sonar systems, each about the size of a small car, would have to be wedged into already cramped submarine decks, one submarine expert says.    Navy officials also hope to make progress in designing improved computer programs that can process natural and man-made ocean noises. Decades of research notwithstanding, the ocean often seems opaque and indecipherable to submariners. &quot;There are days out there when nobody can hear anything,&quot; says Adm. DeMars. &quot;The ocean is a very complex mechanism that we know far less about than the atmosphere. We still don't know how to model the ocean with any reliability.&quot;    Meanwhile, the Navy is working to improve the detection capabilities of other systems. &quot;Surface ships are improving their sonar systems,&quot; says Capt. Thomas Robertson, who commands one of the Navy's 10 submarine squadrons in the Atlantic fleet. And there is room for progress. &quot;I don't see us being near the top of our capability there,&quot; he says.    Despite Soviet improvements, Capt. Robertson believes that the U.S. continues to have the edge in building ever quieter submarines. While Soviet &quot;subs are quieter and therefore can get closer,&quot; he says, &quot;our advantage is significant.&quot;    The newest U.S. attack sub in the works, the SSN-21 Seawolf, is likely to be the world's quietest boat and will be filled with the latest sonar and data-processing equipment. Each submarine will cost between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, up from the current Los Angeles-class attack submarines, which cost about $750 million apiece.    Navy officials say the U.S. will count on the Seawolf fleet for the next 30 years. However, others aren't so sanguine. Norman Polmar, who edits the Naval Institute Press's annual &quot;Guide to the Soviet Navy,&quot; recently wrote that because of Russian improvements, &quot;the planned U.S. Seawolf is expected to be only five to 10 years ahead of Soviet submarines in terms of quieting and acoustic techniques.&quot;    Worried that the costly Seawolf might provide only a short-lived advantage over Russian boats, some lawmakers in the House recently threatened to mothball the project. The Navy fought this move; and for the time being, the Seawolf is out of danger.    On another front, the Navy is conducting highly classified research into non-acoustic ways to locate submarines; such methods include aerial or space-based systems to measure factors like special wrinkling on the ocean's surface when subs are present. Officials don't expect quick breakthroughs in these areas. The Soviets also are studying non-acoustic detection techniques.    Meanwhile, the Navy is in turmoil over other facets of its anti-submarine capability. The Navy's venerable fleet of submarine-hunting P-3 airplanes, produced by Lockheed, is thinning out. By 1993, about 100 of the 500 or so planes currently deployed around the world will be too old to fly safely and will be retired.    The Navy isn't ordering replacements but wants to stir up a competition for a new P-3-G that can carry deadlier weapons and bigger radars. The project has been slowed by bickering between the Navy and Lockheed over who owns the piles of blueprints used to make the current P-3s. And although Rockwell International Inc. and Gulfstream Corp. have expressed tepid interest in the competition, many other aerospace companies are hanging back. If the competition plan drags much longer and Lockheed shuts down its current P-3 production line, the Navy could face a much reduced anti-submarine capability in the early 1990s.    The aircraft may be more important in a world of quieter submarines. If enemy boats are more elusive, reasons a Lockheed official, it is necessary to have aircraft that can attack them quickly when they are spotted.    ---   U.S.-Soviet Submarine Balance   (Number of submarines)                     U.S.      Soviet Diesel-attack        12         130 Ballistic            36          77 Nuclear-attack       85          70   Source: International Institute for Strategic Studies</TEXT></DOC>
