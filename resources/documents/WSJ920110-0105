Itoh andamp; Co. of Japan and British Petroleum Co.plan to jointly build an oil refinery on the Indonesianisland of Bintan near Singapore with a processing capacity of120,000 barrels per day, an Itoh spokesman said.   The two companies recently applied for approval from theIndonesian government for the export-oriented refinerylocated at Tanjung Uban, which will come on stream around1995 and process Mideast crude oil rather than local crudes,he said.</LP><TEXT>   The two companies estimate the cost of the project at $1.5billion, which they will provide in the form of the capitalof the project company.   The refinery will be wholly owned by a project company, inwhich Itoh and BP will each hold 50% of the shares, thespokesman said, adding that neither the Indonesian governmentnor the state oil company Pertamina will participate.
