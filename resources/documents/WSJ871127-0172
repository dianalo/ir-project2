Meritor said that if holders of two-thirds of the principal amount of the $115 million of capital notes outstanding approve the proposal, the rate of interest on the notes would be increased to 12.5% from 12%, effective Jan. 1, and Meritor would be able to pay its regular quarterly dividend of five cents on Jan. 4.    Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc., New York, said it downgraded the rating of the Meritor $115 million of 12% subordinated capital notes to single-B-1 from Ba-3.    Moody's said the downgrade reflects potential asset quality problems and weak prospects for improved operating performance. Moody's put the debt under review for possible downgrade on Oct. 16. Meritor declined to comment on the downgrade.    Meritor's modification of the indenture would shift the period of earnings on which dividends are paid to net income after Dec. 31, 1987. Currently, it is based on net income after Dec. 31, 1985.    Meritor said last month that it intended to seek the change when it reported a third-quarter loss of $379.6 million, primarily due to a non-cash reduction of $330 million in good will, that would prohibit payment of a dividend under present terms of the indenture on its capital notes. </TEXT></DOC>
