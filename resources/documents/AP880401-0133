Horan is expected to be replaced by career diplomat WalterCutler, a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia who was succeeded byHoran last September, the official said.   The official, who asked not to be identified, denied a publishedreport that Horan was being withdrawn at Saudi request and that hisrecall was related to U.S. complaints over the Saudi purchase ofChinese missiles.   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley confirmedthat Horan was being reassigned but she gave no further details.   Meanwhile, a group of 32 senators urged the administration in aletter to pressure the Saudis to withdraw the missiles.   The letter from the senators says the administration shouldreconsider a $450 million support package of training andmaintenance for AWACS radar surveillance planes. The administrationhas not yet asked officially for congressional approval of thepackage.   ``We strongly believe that our current policy toward arms salesto Saudi Arabia must be re-examined,'' the letter said.   The Saudi deployment of the CSS-2 intermediate-range missilescame to light two weeks ago in news reports and was confirmed bythe State Department, which said the rockets are not yetoperational.   Shultz will be meeting with Saudi leaders in Riyadh next weekduring his shuttle mission to the Mideast. He will be lobbying forIsraeli-Arab peace talks, but also is expected to bring up theChinese missiles.   Shultz already expressed U.S. concern about the sale of themissiles, which have a range of 1,850 miles, when he met inWashington earlier this month with Chinese Foreign Minister WuXueqian.   Saudi Arabia, an ally of Iraq, says it needed the missiles toprotect itself in case of a further escalation in the Iran-Iraqwar, especially in view of Iranian threats.   But U.S. officials say the Saudis bought the missiles infrustration over repeated attempts by Congress to block Americanarms sales.   The kingdom began negotiating the deal with the Chinese in 1985,after Congress blocked the sale of 48 F-15 jet fighters to SaudiArabia. Congress late last year agreed to sell the Saudis 24 F-15sin order to maintain Saudi air strength at its current levels.   The CSS-2 rockets also have a nuclear capability, but both Chinaand Saudi Arabia have assured the United States they do not intendto arm the rockets with nuclear warheads.   In another letter, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., called for ahearing by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss theimplications of the new Saudi missiles and the reported failure byU.S. intelligence to detect the purchase from China for some twoyears.   ``We are also deeply concerned that the Saudis hid the fact thatthey possess these weapons,'' the letter said.</TEXT></DOC>
