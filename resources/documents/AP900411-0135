U.S. District Judge Harold Greene approved the extension untilApril 24 sought Tuesday by the office of Poindexter's attorney,Richard W. Beckler.   The office of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, which hasbeen investigating the Iran-Contra scandal since December 1986,filed court papers Wednesday saying it did not oppose the extension.   Beckler's motion requested the extra time to file motions for adirected verdict of acquittal and for a new trial, both of whichwould require the judge to set aside last Saturday's jury verdict.   Frederick Robinson, an attorney with Beckler's office who signedthe request for the extra time, said the motions will not be basedon new evidence, but he declined to say what arguments will be made.   ``Those are things we're working out now,'' he said. ``I'm notat liberty to get into all the grounds yet.''   The deadline for such motions without an extension would havebeen April 17, he said.   Poindexter, 53, was convicted Saturday of conspiracy,obstruction and lying to Congress. He could face up to 25 years inprison and $1.25 million in fines when he is sentenced June 11.   Beckler said immediately after the conviction that he planned toappeal.   ``We're naturally disappointed with the verdict in this case,but we're going to appeal it and we're going to keep fighting it ashard as we can,'' Beckler said at the time.   Poindexter was the third top Reagan administration figureconvicted in the scandal. The others, former Poindexter aide OliverNorth and former national security adviser Robert McFarlane, havenot served any jail time.   Poindexter was convicted of conspiring with North, businessmanRichard Secord and others to conceal the truth about theIran-Contra affair from Congress.   Specifically, Poindexter was accused of covering up North'ssecret Contra resupply network and the U.S. role in a CIA-assistedshipment of Hawk missiles to Iran in November 1985.   North's Contra military assistance operation occurred during acongressional ban that required the CIA to withdraw militarysupport for the rebels fighting the Sandinista government inNicaragua.</TEXT></DOC>
