With the advent of new low cost corrosion resistantsteels, dependable acid hydrolysis process equipment now exists whichcan carry out the conversion of starch to high glucose containing syrupsin about 180 s or less and in plant modules of up to 300 to 350 gal/minof feed. A detailed study of the saccharide distributions on a full rangeof these acid converted hydrolysates has been carried out and comparedto dual enzyme derived hydrolysates. The approximate amounts presentof reversion products from the higher acid conversions can be demonstratedin dimers and estimated in the higher DP saccharides. Fermentations carriedout on these substrates show that the reversion products were not assimilatedin the process. They account for the gradually lower ethanol yields ofsubstrates with increasing acid conversion. Substrates with saccharideprofiles of about 89% glucose, 10% dimers and 1% trimers can be producedby the new acid conversion processes at solids levels of about 20 to22%. Fermentations with a variety of ethanol producing organisms haveshown no evidence of inhibitions due to the presence of deleterious compounds.The residual non-fermented solutions free of yeast and ethanol (stillage)will rehydrolyse with acid to the initial saccharide profile. Thus itis possible to dilute the starch feed with stillage at a given recycleration and reduce to practical levels of 3 to 4% the non-fermented saccharidesin the fermentation process. 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
