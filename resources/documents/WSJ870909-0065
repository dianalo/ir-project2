Hundreds cheered him as more workers gathered around him on an open field inside the seaside complex. &quot;Let us strike!&quot; he cried.    Mr. Lee then led several thousand workers in seizing the plant, which they declared wouldn't be given back until their wages were boosted by one-third.    Though not always as dramatic, similar scenes have been playing out for two months across South Korea, which long has had one of the lowest levels of unionism of any industrial country, as an independent labor movement is born. The Labor Ministry said Monday that worker protests were slowing, crediting that to a government crackdown on leftist agitators. But by government count, about 3,200 companies in the auto manufacturing, electronics, transport and other important industries have been hit by strikes since July. The sit-in at Daewoo Shipbuilding andamp; Heavy Machinery Ltd. was settled last week, but about 320 other disputes remain unresolved, including a sit-in at the Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. shipyard in Ulsan.    &quot;There is a new spirit,&quot; says a Western diplomat, who watches the labor scene. &quot;There is no way to rein it in.&quot;    What happens now? That depends on two things: whether management can gain the trust of the workers, and whether union leaders can control the rank and file. It doesn't look good on either count. Indeed, labor experts say there is only a slim chance that South Korea can lay a foundation for labor relations that might calm worker unrest soon.    &quot;No one has any experience in these things and no one trusts anyone,&quot; says Park Young Ki, director of the Sogang University Institute for Labor and Management. &quot;More conflict is inevitable because it will take so much time to change.&quot;    What is happening in South Korea resembles the U.S. labor movement early in this century. Then, there were bloody strikes as the government sided with employers, and charges that Communists had infiltrated the movement.    In Korea, labor conflicts have added heat to the unstable political situation. The new unions are growing more adversarial. Companies keep asking the government to smash the unions. But the ruling party can't risk alienating workers, who will vote in the coming elections. It refuses -- so far -- to backtrack on its July 1 promise of greater democracy or to return to the policy of overt union busting.    Radicals inside organized labor, though few, are trying to use the movement to destabilize the government. That has led to high turnover among inexperienced union leaders. If, in quelling the radicals, union leaders appear too conservative or pro-management, they are ousted by the rank and file. Meanwhile, the government has vowed to crush leftist involvement in labor unions and has shadowed and arrested students, church activists and others who dare to advise the unions.    In fact, there is some question that the emerging labor movement can survive. Relative periods of labor freedom in 1960, 1970 and 1979 were all crushed, authorities say, because of the threat that higher wages posed to the country's export-dependent economic machine.    Similar warnings are being raised about the current unrest. Government economists estimate that the recent spate of strikes has cost the country $1.4 billion in lost exports and production and could slow the economic growth rate to 5.7% in the second half from 15% in the first half. What is more, worker violence at several plants, which union leaders and the police couldn't quell, increases concern that the military will feel compelled to step in.    The government history of weighing in on the side of companies has played the key role in souring labor relations. Laws remain on the books that outlaw all but government-sanctioned unions. Regulations made legal strikes almost impossible. Union leaders were fired and imprisoned.    Companies &quot;are accustomed to getting help from the government and ignoring the worker,&quot; says Prof. Park of the Sogang labor-management institute. Despite the &quot;economic miracle&quot; that has boosted per-capita gross national product twentyfold since 1967, the average Korean works longer hours, almost 52 a week, and is paid less, $1.55 an hour, than workers in other industrialized nations.    But the power equation changed July 1 when the government declared its commitment to greater democracy. The government's stance angered and frustrated company executives, who have been forced to settle the illegal strikes with little help from the government. As a result, the settlements have been large; raises of more than 15% are common.    &quot;I feel helpless,&quot; lamented Kim Woo Joong, chairman of the giant Daewoo conglomerate, during the strike negotiations at his shipyard.    Companies are worried that every wage boost granted gives an impetus for other unions to seek the same amount, making Korea's export industries less and less competitive. They also fret that worker productivity is suffering.    &quot;All this union talk has just made workers lazier,&quot; says a Hyundai Motor Co. manager. &quot;The workers don't work very hard. They spend a lot of time smoking and going to the bathroom. They waste a lot of our money.&quot;    &quot;We are an export-led country,&quot; says Mr. Kim of Daewoo. &quot;We must win the game in the international market with our low labor costs. Workers must render some sacrifice. Later, they can enjoy their lives.&quot;    Comments Prof. Park, the Korean labor-relations expert, &quot;If they are wise, they {management} will come up with a more realistic approach.&quot;    The companies are calling for cooperative, Japanese-style &quot;company unions.&quot; &quot;As an oriental people,&quot; says Chun Byung Ro, a Daewoo Shipbuilding executive, &quot;we want it to be a Japanese model.&quot;    But it is too late, labor experts say. Korea's long history of labor-management antagonism prevents it. &quot;Companies have to realize that Korea isn't Japan,&quot; says an American labor organizer who advises Korean trade unionists.    For example, while major Korean companies have supplied many worker benefits, workers and managers interviewed couldn't name a single instance where workers are involved in decision-making. Unlike in Japan, teamwork is weak and lifetime employment usually isn't promised; nor is there an absence of the display of rank that exists in Japanese factories.    Daewoo Shipbuilding provides tennis courts and swimming pools, and cheap haircuts and laundry facilities. Samsung Electronics gives education subsidies and doesn't segregate white-collar workers from blue-collar workers in the company cafeterias. Lately, companies have introduced more benefits to try to head off unrest.    But workers don't seem to notice. They show less company loyalty than their Japanese counterparts, job hopping whenever a better opportunity comes along.    &quot;Those things don't matter,&quot; says Hwang Heun Yeon, a 30-year-old pipewelder at Daewoo Shipbuilding. He complains that management often covers up work-site accidents because a bad safety record could hurt a manager's chances for promotion. &quot;And if it isn't officially reported, then we have to pay the hospital bill,&quot; he says, nursing a bandaged right hand that was injured when fragments from a tear-gas cannister struck his finger during a confrontation with riot police.    Distrust and alienation are evident among workers at the Hyundai Motor plant in Ulsan; workers giving speeches in the factory yard harped on management's &quot;discrimination&quot; against them. &quot;Ventilation in our shop is poor, but the offices have air-conditioning,&quot; says Yoon Bong Hak, a 28-year-old union leader. A union official complains that the manager's children won't socialize with workers' children at the elementary school.    Kim Hyung Kwon, a 30-year-old strike leader at Hyundai Heavy Industries, says the company negotiates insincerely. &quot;The company is playing games with us,&quot; says the union's administrative secretary. He says Hyundai sent minor officials to negotiate wages, then backpedaled on promises made during an earlier walkout. He blames the company for the arrest of more than a hundred union leaders.    He says the company also tries to provoke the union. Monday's attempt to lock out shipyard workers is an example. &quot;They want us to march on the streets again. We can't control the men there and they know it,&quot; says Mr. Kim, who says the police are searching for him.    In mid-August, he says, the company moved two large forklifts to block the workers' entrance to the plant stadium, where rallies are held. &quot;They wanted the men to burn it. They even took the keys so we would be provoked.&quot; Union leaders hotwired the vehicles to move them and defused the situation.    Company officials have a different story. &quot;They {the unions} won't tell the workers what we are really offering,&quot; says a senior vice president, who declined to speak on the record. The company was also irritated when the union made a contract-negotiating point out of the death of a worker in an auto accident. &quot;The union is trying to negotiate with a coffin,&quot; he says. &quot;They want to play little games with us. They have been energized by past events and think they can do anything.&quot;    Managers and government officials are convinced that radicals in the work force are stirring the discontent. &quot;They are controlled by outside powers,&quot; says a Daewoo executive. But workers seem to pay little attention to the activists.    When workers struck at the Daewoo plant in Okpo, dozens of dissidents came to the isolated southeastern coastal island to meet with workers. &quot;We are not the aliens. We are taking sides with you,&quot; Woo Ryu Dong, chairman of the Korea Christian Workers League, told workers in a fiery speech. &quot;The capitalists are the aliens. The riot police are the aliens.&quot;    Worker response was tepid. Mr. Hwang, the injured welder, said he was interested in money, not bringing down the government. M.H. Chung, a student radical, conceded that labor leaders rebuffed the dissidents' attempt to politicize the Daewoo strike. &quot;The current labor leaders aren't qualified,&quot; he says. &quot;They don't have the experience to run a strike.&quot;    Indeed, the lack of strong leadership may be the biggest threat to the labor movement's survival. &quot;Many have no understanding of how to manage a union,&quot; says Harry G. Kamberis, an AFL-CIO official who helps run education programs for the new union leaders. &quot;They don't know the strategies for collective bargaining or controlling the rank and file.&quot;    The government arrests of past years purged most of the experienced leaders. And if they aren't fired, companies find other ways to muzzle them; Lee Yong Bok, an activist at Hyundai Motor, was transferred to facilities around the country five times in 12 months. So unions are led by young and untested men.    Such instability leads to frequent challenges to union leadership. The Daewoo Shipbuilding strike is a good example. The day after Mr. Lee led the strike, workers became convinced that he had turned &quot;pro-management.&quot; They beat him up and he went into hiding. A new leader was elected -- and almost purged when he agreed to a compromise that did little to improve wages.    The presence of outsiders, whom the union called consultants, has clearly worried the government. Every day, several arrests are made of people charged with &quot;inciting labor strikes.&quot;    At the Hyundai Heavy strike, union officials put their own guards at the gate to keep dissidents and radicals out of the yard. &quot;We know everyone who is in here,&quot; says a union leader. &quot;There are no Communists or outside elements.&quot; The union says it wouldn't even let in politicians. &quot;We don't want this strike to be politicized,&quot; says Mr. Kim, the union's adminstrative secretary.    The union contends that last week's violence was caused by hooligans and drunk workers, not radicals. The union has redoubled its efforts to control the strikers, who turned ugly under the hot sun, frustration and alcohol last week. Offices were vandalized and several cars were burned on the street.    &quot;The situation will stay calm. It must stay calm. Otherwise we will be crushed,&quot; says a union member.    But the bigger problem for the union is establishing some stability of leadership. Increasingly, merely compromising or settling with an employer is enough to brand a union leader as &quot;pro-management.&quot;    At Hyundai Motor, the union president, a 30-year-old car assembler, found his leadership challenged only a week after successfully confronting management and forming the auto makers first union. No fewer than seven other candidates want the job.    (See related story: &quot;...As Strikes, Big Pay Increases Threaten Nation's Economic Boom&quot; -- WSJ Sept. 9, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
