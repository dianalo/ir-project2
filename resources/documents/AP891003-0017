These analysts look for interest rates, including mortgagerates, to move up and down in a narrow range in coming months asthe Fed tries to steer the $5 trillion U.S. economy along a path ofmoderating growth and moderating inflation.   Policymakers at the Fed gathered for a closed-door strategysession today of the Federal Open Market Committee, composed ofmembers of the Fed board in Washington and five of the 12 Fedregional bank presidents.   While the results of their deliberations will not be publiclydisclosed for six weeks, many economists were predicting that thecentral bank will decide to make no changes to its current creditstance.   These analysts believe that the Fed is on the verge of achievingits hoped-for soft landing, whereby growth slows just enough in thesecond half of the year to keep inflation in check but not enoughto topple the country into a recession.   ``The country is on a moderate but sustainable growth course. Itis exactly the kind of low-altitude flying that the Fed has beenseeking,'' said David Jones, chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston andamp;Co., a government securities dealer.   Because of the belief that the Fed will not fiddle with itsmonetary controls, analysts were looking for little change ininterest rates in coming months.   Banks' prime lending rate, which serves as a benchmark for manybusiness and consumer loans, was expected to hold at 10.5 percent.   Long-term rates, reflected by Treasury's benchmark 30-yearbonds, were expected to trade in a narrow range between 8 percentand 8.5 percent.   Mortgage rates, which have been on a roller coaster this year,were expected to stabilize as well, right around the current levelof 10.16 percent.   Fixed-term mortgages hit a high this year of 11.22 percent inApril and fell as low as 9.68 percent in early August before risingslightly in recent weeks.   The administration, however, is convinced that further ratedeclines are needed to improve the economic outlook next year.   Both Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management andBudget, and Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser,have made comments recently about the need for the Fed to lowerinterest rates.   In remarks that were endorsed by President Bush, Darmancomplained that the central bank was keeping interest rates toohigh and would have to bear the blame if the country topples into arecession next year.   The administration apparently is also unhappy because itbelieves the central bank should be doing more to support lastweek's agreement by the United States and six other economic powersto drive the dollar lower as a way of improving America's hugetrade deficit.   Lower interest rates in the United States would push the dollardown because dollar-denominated assets would be less attractive toforeign investors. A lower dollar makes U.S. exports morecompetitive on overseas markets.   ``There is a good deal of domestic political and internationalheat on the Fed to ease policy further in order to push the dollarlower to keep exports strong and the economy strong over theremainder of this year and next year,'' Jones said.   Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co., agreed, saying,``This administration wants very much to avoid any slowdown in anelection year'' next year when 435 House districts and one-third ofthe Senate seats are at stake.   After a yearlong credit-tightening effort, the central bankeased credit slightly in June and July in the face of mountingsigns that the record seven-year economic expansion was in dangerof faltering.   Since that time, however, much of the data on which the Fedbased its decision has been revised to show the economy was notthat weak in the spring and summer.   Many economists believe the Fed would actually be tighteningcredit now if it had not been for various reports showing thatinflation, which spurted ahead early in the year because of higherenergy and food costs, was moderating as well.   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said she wasnot looking for the Fed to ease further unless economic growth inthe final three months of the year falters much more than iscurrently expected.</TEXT></DOC>
