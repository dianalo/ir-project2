The Franck--Condon analysis of the vibrationalsubstructure shows that within the 10{sup -14} s lifetime of the corehole excited state the molecule adjusts to the excited state configuration,characterized by a change in bond length by 0.071 A. Interference effectsdue to the short lifetime of the intermediate state play only a minorrole.</TEXT></DOC>
