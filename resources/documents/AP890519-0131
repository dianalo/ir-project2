PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A top-level commission Friday found evidence of``gross violations'' of law by two anti-corruption crusaders andturned them over to the national prosecutor's office forinvestigation.   The report by a commission that included Minister of JusticeAlexander Sukharev and KGB chief Vladimir Kruchkov brought to ahead the dispute that started a week ago when one of theinvestigators said the names of Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachevand other top officials had come up in their inquiry.   ``This kind of accusation, not based on any kind of objectiveevidence, is a gross violation of the honor and dignity of theindividuals, which is protected by law,'' said the commission,which was formed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, thecountry's highest executive body.   It said complaints and evidence from defendants as well as otherinvestigators and government officials accused investigators TelmanGdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov of threatening defendants, inducing themto implicate others, arresting their relatives without evidence,holding suspects for months without questioning or charges, andcarelessly handling valuables the seized.   The commission said accusations against Gdlyan and Ivanov ``havea serious basis.''   It said it was acting on accusations made by the KGB, theJustice Ministry, the Supreme Court and other top national bodies.   Gdlyan has been removed as head of an investigation ofcorruption in the republic of Uzbekistan that he has headed sinceSeptember 1983, and the accusations were turned over to the SovietProcurator General's Office for ``careful verification,'' it said.   Ivanov said in a pre-election debate broadcast May 5 onLeningrad TV that the names of Ligachev, former Politburo memberMikhail S. Solomentsev and other top officials had come up in hiscorruption investigation. Two days later, he won 61 percent of thevote in a race with more than two dozen candidates for aparliamentary seat representing all of Moscow.   Ligachev and Solomentsev released statements denying anywrongdoing and labelling Ivanov's statement a politicalprovocation. They demanded an investigation of the claims becarried out, and that the results be made public.   Ligachev is considered by many a conservative counterforce toPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the Politburo and a potentialrival to the Soviet leader. He is particularly unpopular amongradical reformers. Solomentsev retired from the Politburo inSeptember.   Gdlyan won a parliamentary seat March 26 with about 87 percentof the vote in a Moscow district. Both men have become famousthroughout the country for their investigation of corruption inUzbekistan that led to convictions of top local officials and ledto Yuri Churbanov, the son-in-law of former President Leonid I.Brezhnev.   Churbanov was convicted of taking bribes in December andsentenced to 12 year in a labor camp.   The commission's statement was read on the evening TV newsprogram ``Vremya,'' ensuring that millions of Soviets would hear it.   The investigators have said repeatedly they are trying to widentheir investigation to include corruption in the Kremlin itself,but are running into resistance from highly placed officials.   The commission accused them of ignoring the Uzbekistaninvestigation. It said Gdlyan had been in Uzbekistan only threedays this year while Ivanov had not been there at all.   It said that the investigators' ``accusatory style of work'' and``provocative method of obtaining evidence'' had damaged PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev's drive to strengthen the Soviet Union'ssystem of law.   Gorbachev, a lawyer, has said respect for the law must beincreased to avoid the systematic disregard that characterized thepurges of the Stalin years.   A popular editor on Wednesday likened the corruption crusade toa Soviet version of the Watergate scandal.   Gdlyan also is under scrutiny for his handling of aninvestigation of a well-known Estonian scientist Johannes Hint, whowas jailed in 1983 on corruption charges and later died in jail.   The Soviet Supreme Court this month vindicated Hint and severalother co-defendants, and told the Procurator General's Office toreview whether Gdlyan should keep his job as a top criminalinvestigator.</TEXT></DOC>
