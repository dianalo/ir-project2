The 235,000-square-foot research-and-development center inGeorgia initially will employ about 300 people and is slated forcompletion by late 1990, Amoco said in a statement.   Scientists and engineers at the center will work on productdevelopment and conduct research in carbon fibers, engineeringpolymers and advanced composite materials, the company said.   At Greenville, Amoco will expand its existing polyacrylonitrile(PAN) and pitch carbon-fiber plant to expand production of PANcarbon fibers. Demand for the fibers _ used to reinforcelightweight synthetic materials _ is increasing in the aerospace,industrial and sporting-goods industries, Amoco said.   The first of three new production lines at the Greenville plantis scheduled for start-up in early 1990, the company said. Theexpansion is expected to boost employment at the plant from 430 tonearly 650 over five years, said spokesman Richard Judy.   Both projects will be handled by Amoco Performance ProductsInc., a unit of Amoco Chemical Co.   ``A total investment in these two projects of more than $150million is part of Amoco Chemical's long-term strategy to improveour already excellent profitability through product innovation,high-technology research and expansion of capacity to sustain ourcompetitive advantage,'' said Robert D. Cadieux, president of AmocoChemical.</TEXT></DOC>
