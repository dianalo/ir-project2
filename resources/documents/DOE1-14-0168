Whilethis argument is correct for gas, water and solute transport, recenttheoretical and experimental studies have shown that virtually no heatexchange occurs in vessels under 100 {mu}m and that the primary mechanismfor microvascular heat exchange is the imperfect heat exchange betweenthe larger paired countercurrent microvessels that occur 3 to 6 generationsprior to the capillaries. A new fundamental bioheat equations has beenderived to describe this heat transfer mechanism. This equation containsa basic new expression for the thermal conductivity of perfused tissuewhich depends on the geometry and flow in the largest microvessels ofthe local tissue element and the direction of the vessels relative tothe local tissue temperature gradient. Although the new equation appearsto be complicated, it is shown that it can be applied with relative easeto a host of problems previously treated by the Pennes equation.</TEXT></DOC>
