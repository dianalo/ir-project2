The Kansan, who outlined his two-track legislativestrategy yesterday, also met with seven other top-levelcongressional and White House negotiators for a third day inthe Capitol to try to break the months-long budget impasse.Although Sen. Dole's proposal was resisted by the White Houseand some conservative Republicans, it could presage some typeof solution that removes the most contentious issues from thedeficit-reduction package. At the very least, it illustratedthe personal frustration of Sen. Dole, who has traditionallygiven deficit reduction a higher priority than tax cuts.</LP><TEXT>   Though an official Democratic response wasn't immediatelyavailable, top staffers reacted coolly. Sen. Dole's planwould pair some of Democrats' top priorities, including achild-care initiative, with the capital-gains tax rate cutthat they oppose as a boon to the rich. Any increasedspending or lost revenue in the package would have to beoffset with new taxes or budget cuts, under what he called a&quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; proposal.   Sen. Dole said this legislation would be consideredseparately from a $50 billion deficit-reduction plan thatnegotiators are trying to assemble, but that passage of oneis contingent on passage of the other.   The negotiators, who are to meet again today, arestruggling to reach an agreement before the new fiscal yearbegins Oct. 1. Their goal is to reduce the federal budgetdeficit, estimated at more than $250 billion in fiscal 1991,by $50 billion in the coming fiscal year and $500 billionover five years.   In the meantime, however, both parties are maneuvering toconfront the consequences of failure. Republicans expressgrowing confidence that they can kill any effort to delaybillions of dollars in automatic spending cuts that wouldtake effect after Oct. 1 unless a budget accord is reached.They are encouraging President Bush to veto a postponement ofthe cuts, as a way of keeping pressure on budget negotiators.   Democratic House leaders have discussed including a delayprovision as part of a short-term spending bill that willprobably be needed to finance the government for the firstweeks of the new fiscal year. Some Democrats suggest a vetostrategy could backfire, saddling Republicans with the blamefor the automatic cuts just weeks before the election.   Among the Democrats' latest proposals is a provision thatwould raise $12 billion over five years from the nation'sbanks by increasing the premium charged for depositinsurance. The premium would rise to 27 cents per $100 ofdeposits in 1992. Federal regulators already have proposedraising the premium to 19.5 cents per $100 of deposits nextyear.   Some, however, question the appropriateness of raisingpremiums at a time when bank profits are narrowing. Accordingto a Congressional Budget Office analysis, the higher premiumwould further tighten profits, pushing a few shakyinstitutions over the edge. Furthermore, the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., which insures bank deposits, can raisepremiums only to protect its insurance fund against existingor projected future losses.   The proposal was added to the latest Democratic budgetoffer on Monday, just hours after the House approved a billthat would do away with the limit on what the FDIC can chargefor insurance.   A similar bill is pending in the Senate, and the Bushadministration yesterday introduced its own bill designed toallow the FDIC to raise bank insurance premiums. Theadministration plan differs slightly from the House version,removing mandatory rebates for banks if the insurance fundreaches a certain level. It also would allow the FDIC toborrow from the Federal Financing Bank, which provides moneyfor such agencies as the Postal Service.   ---   Greg Hitt contributed to this column.</TEXT></DOC>
