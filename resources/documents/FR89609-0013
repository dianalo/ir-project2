In the preparation of that package,it was intended that section 199.4(f)(7) of 32 CFR Part 199 be deleted.Instead andSection; 199.4(f)(6) was omitted and 199.4(f)(7) was retained.The enclosed materials rectify the error by reinserting the original andSection;199.4(f)(6) and deleting andSection; 199.4(f)(7) as was originally intended.This rule was written to correct the inadvertent errors in a previous publicationand we, therefore, certify that this amendment will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 199 </ITAG>Health Insurance, Military personnel, Handicapped.Accordingly, 32 CFR Part 199 is amended to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 199_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1. The authority citation for Part 199 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>10 U.S.C. 1079, 1086, 5 U.S.C. 301.</ITAG>2. Section 199.4 is amended by removing paragraph (f)(7) and adding paragraph(f)(6) to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 199.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Basic program benefits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(f) * * * (6) <T3>Amounts over CHAMPUS-determined allowable costs or charges. </T3>Itis the responsibility of the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary to determine allowablecosts for services and supplies provided by hospitals and other institutionsand allowable charges for services and supplies provided by physicians,other individual professional providers, and other providers. Such CHAMPUS-determinedallowable costs or charges are made in accordance with the provisions ofSection 199.14. All CHAMPUS benefits, including calculation of the CHAMPUSor beneficiary cost-sharing amounts, are based on such CHAMPUS-determinedallowable costs or charges. The effect on the beneficiary when the billedcost or charge is over the CHAMPUS-determined allowable amount is dependentupon whether or not the applicable claim was submitted on a participatingbasis on behalf of the beneficiary or submitted directly by the beneficiaryon a nonparticipating basis and on whether the claim is for inpatient hospitalservices subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. This provisionapplies to all classes of CHAMPUS beneficiaries.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>When the provider ``forgives'' or ``waives'' any beneficiaryliability, such as amounts applicable to the annual fiscal year deductiblefor outpatient services or supplies, or the inpatient or outpatient cost-sharingas previously set forth in this section, the CHAMPUS-determined allowablecharge or cost allowance (whether payable to the CHAMPUS beneficiary orsponsor, or to a participating provider) shall be reduced by the same amount.</ITAG>(i) <T3>Participating provider. </T3>Under CHAMPUS, authorized professionalproviders and institutional providers other than hospitals have the optionof participating on a claim-by-claim basis. Participation is required forinpatient claims only for hospitals which are Medicare-participating providers.Hospitals which are not Medicare-participating providers but which aresubject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system in andSection; 199.14(a)(1)must sign agreements to participate on all CHAMPUS inpatient claims inorder to be authorized providers under CHAMPUS. All other hospitals mayelect to participate on a claim-by-claim basis. Participating providersmust indicate participation by signing the appropriate space on the applicableCHAMPUS claim form and submitting it to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscalintermediary. In the case of an institution or medical supplier, the claimmust be signed by an official having such authority. This signature certifiesthat the provider has agreed to accept the CHAMPUS-determined allowablecharge or cost as payment in full for the medical services and supplieslisted on the specific claim form, and further has agreed to accept theamount paid by CHAMPUS or the CHAMPUS payment combined with the cost-sharingamount paid by or on behalf of the beneficiary as full payment for thecovered medical services or supplies. Therefore, when costs or chargesare submitted on a participating basis, the patient is not obligated topay any amounts disallowed as being over the CHAMPUS-determined allowablecost or charge for authorized medical services or supplies. (ii) <T3>Nonparticipating providers. </T3>Nonparticipating providers are thoseproviders who do not agree on the CHAMPUS claim form to participate andthereby do not agree to accept the CHAMPUS-determined allowable costs orcharges as the full charge. For otherwise covered services and suppliesprovided by such nonparticipating CHAMPUS providers, payment is made directlyto the beneficiary or sponsor and the beneficiary is liable under applicablelaw for any amounts over the CHAMPUS-determined allowable costs or charges.CHAMPUS shall have no responsibility for any amounts over allowable costsor charges as determined by CHAMPUS.  <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">L.M.
