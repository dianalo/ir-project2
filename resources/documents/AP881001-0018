SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan says the U.S. government is``doing everything we can'' to gain the release of the hostagesheld in Lebanon, but denied his administration is engaged in directnegotiations with Iran.   Reagan was queried about a published report in an Israelinewspaper, which said a deal is in the works to release thehostages, possibly as soon as Oct. 7.   The president _ campaigning in Illinois on behalf of VicePresident George Bush _ told reporters, ``We have no directnegotiations, or have we had, with Iran, at any time, in this.''   ``Certainly there has been no contact between us and thekidnappers,'' the president said.   The American hostages are believed to be held by a pro-Iraniangroup in Lebanon.   An Israeli newspaper reported Friday that eight Americans andone Briton held hostage in Lebanon will be freed in October as aresult of secret talks between the United States and Iran.   The report said that in exchange for the release, Washingtonwill provide economic aid, gradually release billions of dollars inIranian funds frozen in U.S. banks and resume diplomatic relationswith Tehran, the English-language weekly The Nation said in areport from Geneva.   Lunching at a picnic table at a Polish social club known asWozniak's Casino, Reagan told reporters, ``We are doing everythingwe can to get them back. But these rumors and reports are out aboutnegotiations. All I can say is, they must be coming from Iran,because they're not true.''   The Israeli newspaper had reported that a prospectiveU.S.-Iranian deal would result in the release of five Americans,possibly by Oct. 7, with a subsequent liberation of three remainingAmericans at a later point.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters aboard AirForce One en route to Chicago that ``there have been no deals asoutlined in these stories.''   When asked if he was flatly denying that the United States wasconducting negotiations with the hostages, Fitzwater replied,``That's right.''   ``I don't deny that there are people talking to Iran about thehostages, but no U.S. officials are talking to them,'' he said.``There is no one authorized to make a deal for hostages or doanything that is contrary to our policy.''   The spokesman said that while there had been no direct contactbetween officials of the U.S. government and officials of therevolutionary government of the Ayotollah Ruhollah Khomeini, ``theproblem is we hear stories like this from sources all over theMiddle East.''   ``There have been no face-to-face negotiations,'' Fitzwateradded, though he said, ``there have always been third-partycontacts.''   ``There have been no talks that we directed or participated in... the problem is, I cannot account for other people who may havebeen talking to Iran,'' Fitzwater said.   He said the administration had no information about thenewspaper's report of an assassination attempt on Iranianparliamentary speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, although he said, ``We'veseen those reports.''   U.S. officials accompanying Reagan on the Midwest trip declinedto discuss the question of possible contacts with Iran throughintermediaries. The United States has often communicated with Iranthrough third-party Swiss representatives in the years sinceKhomeini's revolutionary government overthrew the Shah of Iran.   The United States has said repeatedly that Iran must release thehostages held by elements sympathetic to its cause. Administrationofficials say the United States would be willing to talk toauthoritative Iranian government figures, but without preconditions.   ``Our policy is still _ no deals,'' Fitzwater said.</TEXT></DOC>
