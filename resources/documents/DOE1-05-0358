Fourapplications studied were: (1) the solar power tower; (2) a medium temperaturesolar system employing line focus collectors; (3) geothermal power systems;and (4) an Integrated Coal-Gasifier Combined Cycle plant. Computer simulationswere developed for each of the system applications and used to calculatethermodynamic performance; the computer simulations were also used toevaluate sensitivity of system performance to key component efficienciesand operating parameters. The computer simulations accounted for allknown first-order loss mechanisms. Only the solar power tower and geothermalpower system are presented in this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
