Traders estimated that RJR in the past three weeks hasbought back nearly $1.5 billion of its 17% bonds of 2007.Much of that buying was done last Thursday, traders said,when Iraq's invasion of Kuwait spooked many participants inthe financial markets. People familiar with the open-marketrepurchase program estimate that RJR bought most bonds at 90cents to 94 cents on the dollar.</LP><TEXT>   For RJR, retiring those bonds is an important step towardshoring up the financial position of the highly leveragedtobacco and food company. The 17% bonds are among RJR'shighest-cost debt. As part of a vast refinancing packageannounced last month, RJR is retiring $4.4 billion of itshigh-yield junk bonds and replacing them with lower-cost bankdebt, new preferred stock and additional equity. Junk bondsare speculative-grade issues with low ratings or no ratingsat all.   The latest repurchases &quot;are positive for the company,&quot;said Dirk van Doren, an analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti andamp;Maffei. &quot;It's nice to see them spending some dough to puttheir plan into effect. I'm surprised, though, that so manypeople sold.&quot;   Traders said RJR's bond buying was arranged by KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co., RJR's majority owner. For severalweeks, KKR told bondholders that it was willing to buy theirbonds back at a slight discount to market prices. Duringmid-July and late July, most holders balked at that offer, asthe RJR bonds of 2007 climbed from depressed levels to ashigh as 95 1/2 cents on the dollar.   Then last week, sentiment abruptly shifted. First a NewJersey court ruling on July 26 raised fresh concerns abouttobacco companies' product liability. Then further troubleswith the UAL Inc. attempted buy-out caused some takeoverstock speculators, who owned large amounts of the RJR bonds,to look for ways to lighten up their portfolios. Then Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait early Thursday morning touched off ageneral financial scare.   &quot;It's amazing how market psychology works,&quot; said one topjunk-bond trader. &quot;It was all greed, greed, greed. Then a lotof greed turned to fear.&quot;   Thursday, as junk-bond prices weakened, word circulatedthat KKR and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. together were carrying outa massive one-day buy-back of the RJR bonds. One trader saidhe heard rumors that sellers were so bountiful that RJR mightsubstantially complete its bond buying that day. With mostRJR bonds down about $10 for each $1,000 face amount, holdersfigured that this was their best chance to sell.   &quot;People panicked,&quot; a former RJR holder said. &quot;BetweenKuwait and the cigarette ruling, people couldn't stand thepain.&quot;   On Thursday alone, KKR and Goldman Sachs together bought$800 million to $1 billion of the RJR bonds, according topeople familiar with the repurchase. At least some of thosepurchases were below the bonds' New York Stock Exchangeclosing price of 91 3/4 cents on the dollar, traders said.KKR, Goldman and RJR all said they wouldn't comment abouttheir roles.   If traders' estimates of RJR's purchase prices are right,the company probably acquired the bonds at $150 million ormore below face value, adjusting for accrued interest on thebonds.   That's a nifty windfall for RJR. Last month, the companyreset the bonds' interest rates from their previous 14.07%,as part of its obligation to make the bonds trade at fullface value on what legal documents called &quot;a fullydistributed basis.&quot; RJR also had penciled in plans to pay asmuch as full face value for any bonds it retired.   As McCarthy Crisanti's Mr. van Doren observed: &quot;It isn'tas if KKR and RJR didn't tell us what they were going to do&quot;with the bond repurchases. &quot;What's interesting is that theypulled it off so quickly. It's a smooth act.&quot;   The next step in RJR's refinancing package will be a $2.4billion exchange offer for its 17 3/8% bonds of 2009. RJRwill offer cash and new preferred shares to bondholders. Thatexchange offer has been filed with the Securities andExchange Commission and is expected to begin in about sixweeks.   RJR also is committed to buy sufficiently more of the 17%bonds so that its purchases total $1.7 billion by next April.In addition, RJR has promised to spend at least another $350million to buy either the 17% or the 17 3/8% bonds in theopen market or via tender offers.</TEXT></DOC>
