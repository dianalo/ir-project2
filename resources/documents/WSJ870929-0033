The court allowed Gold Fields to complete purchases made last week of 15.8 million shares that will boost its stake in Newmont to 49.7%, but it ordered that the shares should not be used to &quot;alter the status quo.&quot; The court gave Gold Fields the option of either depositing the stock in escrow or &quot;holding separate&quot; the shares.    The decision appeared to be a partial victory for Ivanhoe Partners, a group controlled by the Texas oil investor T. Boone Pickens Jr. Ivanhoe has launched a hostile tender offer for Newmont, a New York-based mining concern. Yesterday's ruling came in response to an Ivanhoe lawsuit alleging that Gold Fields and Newmont illegally &quot;locked out&quot; the possibility of an Ivanhoe tender offer by collaborating in a massive &quot;Street sweep&quot; for Newmont stock early last week.    The ruling may put pressure on Gold Fields and Newmont to consider settling with Ivanhoe or sweetening the $33-a-share dividend that Newmont plans to distribute to its shareholders as part of a restructuring plan. Some traders and investment bankers speculated yesterday that Gold Fields may have access to additional cash to sweeten the dividend because the company's largest shareholder, Minerals andamp; Resources Corp., is about to come into an $809 million windfall from the sale of its 14% stake back to Salomon Inc.    Ivanhoe's tender offer of $105 a share, if successful, would boost Ivanhoe's Newmont stake to 51% from 9.95%.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Newmont closed at $97, up $2 a share.    Ivanhoe yesterday filed another lawsuit against Gold Fields. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., alleges that Gold Fields' purchases last week constituted &quot;an illegal tender offer&quot; under federal securities laws.    In addition, market sources said officials of the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission had made informal inquiries to Gold Fields' investment banker, First Boston Corp., and Wall Street traders and others. The SEC is reviewing the massive purchases of Newmont shares last week to determine whether Gold Fields complied with securities laws in conducting the purchases, the sources said.    An SEC spokeswoman would neither confirm nor deny that inquiries were made. First Boston and Gold Fields officials weren't available to comment.    In yesterday's Delaware Chancery Court ruling, Vice Chancellor Jack B. Jacobs refused Ivanhoe's request that he cancel, or &quot;unwind,&quot; Gold Fields's $1.6 billion in purchases of Newmont stock. But he agreed to an alternative Ivanhoe proposal -- that he order the disputed shares held separately and not voted until a hearing Thursday on Ivanhoe's motion for a preliminary injunction. The injunction being sought would bar Gold Fields from owning more than 26.2% of Newmont, the stake it held before last week's buying began.    Judge Jacobs issued yesterday's order on the condition that &quot;Ivanhoe agree that it likewise will take no action (other than to extend the duration of its pending tender offer)&quot; until the hearing.    In his 17-page opinion, the judge indicated that at Thursday's hearing he will consider ordering Gold Fields to shed its recent stock purchases to permit competitive bidding for the shares. Another option would be to extend indefinitely the prohibition on Gold Fields voting the shares it purchased.    In a precedent for such a divestiture, Sun Co. agreed to a similar arrangement in 1979 and sold a 32% stake in Becton, Dickinson andamp; Co. purchased in January 1978.    Meanwhile, Judge Jacobs left in place his earlier order that the London-based mining concern not increase its Newmont stake before Thursday. He also reiterated his earlier criticism of Newmont's defensive measures and Gold Fields' stock purchases. The judge said the maneuvers may be &quot;indicative of a possible fiduciary violation by Newmont's directors, (aided and abetted by Gold Fields).&quot;    Merger professionals are watching the legal dispute closely. They say it could have bearing on a proposed SEC rule that would prevent market sweeps by friendly suitors who intend to rescue besieged companies.    Lawyers for Newmont and Gold Fields said they were pleased by yesterday's ruling. To their relief, the court didn't order what would have been a complicated and potentially disruptive process of canceling contracts for millions of shares.    Judge Jacobs explained that he declined to unwind the Gold Fields purchases because of the danger of &quot;massive disruption of the securities market.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
