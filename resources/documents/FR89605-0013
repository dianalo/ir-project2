The regulation, and other guidance issued to States, contemplatesthat the cost estimates in their FY 1990 applications, which include updatedcost estimates for FY 1989, be based on actual cost data from FY 1988 andfrom FY 1989. At the time the regulation was published, we expected thatStates would have complete cost data for FY 1988 by December 31, 1988,when annual reports on FY 1988 costs were due, and would have at leastpartial FY 1989 cost data before submitting the FY 1990 application. States' annual reports submitted pursuant to 45 CFR 402.51(e) indicatethat most States need more time to establish FY 1988 costs for a substantialnumber of programs. It appears that States may not have actual cost datafor at least some programs in time to use it in an application that wouldbe due July 15, 1989. The inability of many States to base their FY 1990application estimates on actual cost data will create a less equitabletreatment of States. The great variation in quality of estimates may wellrisk punishing States that can use actual costs, on the one hand, or requireus to apply an extremely rigid standard to all estimates not based on actualcosts. To help States document costs, we are working on several initiatives. Themajor effort is a system that would enable States to determine their actualcosts by matching the Social Security numbers of program participants againstthe Social Security numbers of eligible legalized aliens. (The system isbeing designed so that such a matching system can be employed while maintainingthe strict confidentiality requirements set forth by the Immigration Reformand Control Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-603) for information concerning lawfultemporary residents.) We expect this system to be in place and availableto States by June 1, 1989. That the system will be available this soonis an example of exemplary interagency cooperation among the Immigrationand Naturalization Service, the General Services Administration, and theFamily Support Administration and the Social Security Administration withinthe Department of Health and Human Services. However, we recognize thatit may be impossible for most States to access the system and receive cost data in time to incorporate this information into their FY 1990 applicationsby July 15, 1989. By extending the deadline for the FY 1990 application, we can obviate theneed for States to prepare cost estimates for FY 1989 and projections forFY 1990 in the absence of empirical data on the participation of eligiblelegalized aliens in State and local programs, and then to resubmit costestimates as experiential data becomes available. This will ease the administrativeburden on all levels of government involved in SLIAG and will ensure anequitable allocation of funds. We are therefore extending the deadline for submitting the FY 1990 applicationto October 1, 1989, and the deadline for that application to be approvableby the Secretary to December 15, 1989. This will give States sufficienttime to develop actual cost data which can be used in preparing their FY1990 applications. This change will delay our allocating FY 1990 SLIAGfunds from November 1989 to January 1990. However, this will not disadvantageStates. FY 1990 funds are not available for allocation before October 1in any case, and cost estimates in States' FY 1989 applications indicatethat States will have more than ample FY 1988 and FY 1989 grant funds tocarry over into the first part of calendar year 1990. If a State wishesto submit a completed application before October 1, 1989, we will reviewit promptly and approve it at the earliest possible time. Because the amendments set out in this rule pertain to agency procedureor practice under section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, wehave dispensed with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. We will consider anycomments received and, if necessary, publish another rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures </ITAG>In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Secretary certifies that this ruledoes not have a significant adverse economic impact on small business entities.This rule is not a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O.12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This rule imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements subjectto Office of Management and Budget clearance.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 13.786,  StateLegalization Impact Assistance Grants) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 402 </ITAG>Administrative cost, Allocation formula, Aliens, Allotment, Education,Grant programs, Immigration, Immigration Reform and Control Act, Publicassistance, Public health assistance, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,State Legalization Impact Assistance Grants.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Wayne A.
