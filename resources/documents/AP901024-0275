Unidentified sources quoted in Wednesday's editions of The NewYork Times and The Wall Street Journal said a team of lawyersworked through the weekend to prepare Chapter 11 papers to be filedin U.S. Bankruptcy Court after a board meeting on Monday.   Continental responded to the reports by issuing a statementWednesday saying it had no plans to file for protection fromcreditors.   ``We have streamlined our management, and like the rest of theindustry, are considering other prudent business steps to assistduring the fuel crisis,'' the airline said. ``However, Chapter 11is not one of the means we intend to take.''   Later Wednesday, spokesman Ned Walker said, ``The board examinedseveral different options, one of which was Chapter 11. But it wasrejected in a unanimous vote by the board.   ``Chapter 11 just doesn't make sense for us. We have a lot ofalternatives,'' Walker said.   They include possible asset sales, introduction of outsideinvestors and cost controls, such as the postponement of amultimillion-dollar image campaign, he said.   Continental stock dropped 1| to $4 per share Wednesday on theAmerican Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said ithad downgraded its ratings on debt of Continental Airlines HoldingsInc. and Continental Airlines, because of problems brought on byhigher fuel costs and sluggish demand for air travel.   The airline decided last week to remove 17 aircraft that were nolonger fuel efficient from service on Dec. 1 and replace them withmore efficient models. Walker said jet fuel costs have risen 125percent since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.   A $1.2 billion order for 25 Boeing 757s will still go through,he added.   ``We're in discussions with some parties that are seriouslyinterested in investing'' in Continental, Walker said.   Continental's core operations ``remain strong,'' he said.   ``Speculation that efforts to contain costs might include amajor downsizing of the airline is just that - speculation,'' theairline's statement said.   The reports that Continental had considered bankruptcy surfaceda day after the carrier realigned its senior management team bycutting five top executives in an effort to trim costs.   For the first half of the year, Continental, which until Junewas known as Texas Air Corp., lost $8.7 million, compared with aloss of $365 million in the period a year ago. In June thecarrier's liabilities totaled $1.6 billion.   Third-quarter results, which have not yet been reported, areexpected to show that Continental suffered losses during thenormally busy summer travel season and has been hurt by higher fuelprices since the invasion of Kuwait.   Frank Lorenzo, who recently stepped down as chairman ofContinental but remains on the board, reportedly opposes a Chapter11 filing by the airline, as does Jan Carlzon, chairman ofScandinavian Airlines System, which owns 16.8 percent ofContinental stock. A bankruptcy petition filing would reduce thevalue of SAS's holdings.</TEXT></DOC>
