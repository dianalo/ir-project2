For this purpose we have investigated theadsorption of some selected compounds which are known as injurious forhealth like: methyl cyanide, 2-propenal, benzene, chloro-2,3 -epoxypropane,dichloromethane, pyridine, tetrachloromethane. The values of the adsorptioncapacities have been determined showing significant differences in dependingon the chemical structure of the compound as well as the changes of theionization installed in the Iono-Carbosorb filter.</TEXT></DOC>
