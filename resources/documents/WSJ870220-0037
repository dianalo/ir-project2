Both measures failed in the last Congress, when conservative opponents in the Republican-controlled Senate led the key committees considering the legislation. With control changing to the Democrats, and with substantial numbers of co-sponsors for both measures, lawmakers and civil rights advocates said the climate is right for quick action by both houses.    &quot;I think we will have broad support from both Democrats and Republicans alike,&quot; said Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, at a heavily promoted news conference to introduce the measures. It was attended by representatives of advocacy groups for civil rights, the disabled and women's rights. Sen. Kennedy is a co-sponsor of both bills.    The impact of the leadership change is most obvious in regard to the proposed Fair Housing Amendments Act, which adds provisions to the 1968 Civil Rights Act and was last the subject of a major legislative push in 1980. It was defeated then when Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) led a filibuster. The following year, Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.) became chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Hatch became chairman of the constitution subcommittee, where such legislation is controlled.    These conservative leaders have been replaced by Democrats who are co-sponsoring the measures, as are ranking Republican members of the key committees. Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, for example, is the ranking Republican on the constitution subcommittee and strongly favors the housing measure.    The measure would add the disabled and families with children to the list of groups protected under existing law from discrimination in housing. It also would require the Department of Housing and Urban Development to appoint administrative law judges who would adjudicate bias complaints. Their decisions could be appealed in federal court. Currently, HUD can only conciliate complaints.    While the Reagan administration and the National Association of Realtors have opposed this proposal to handle complaints, some administration officials support further fair-housing efforts. HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce has included $5 million for local fair-housing programs in the budget proposal for the fiscal year starting next Oct. 1. Sources in Congress and the agency said the administration also is considering its own fair-housing legislation.    The second major bill being proposed, the Civil Rights Restoration Act, has come closer to passage since it was introduced to overturn the effects of the Supreme Court's 1984 decision in Grove City vs. Bell. But the measure has become embroiled in the protracted battle over abortion rights.    The court ruled that the federal prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of sex, age or disability in federally assisted institutions, such as universities and hospitals, apply only to specific programs in question receiving funds, and not to the entire institution. The legislation would restore the institution-wide prohibitions that existed before the 1984 decision.    Although the measure previously had passed the House by overwhelming margins, it was stalled in a dispute over a provision added in a House committee. Anti-abortion activists said the provision would ensure that federally assisted institutions aren't compelled to provide abortions. Abortion-rights proponents said the provision would repeal equal-treatment provisions that protect the institution's employees or a university's students who choose abortions.    Despite a lengthy list of co-sponsors -- close to 50 in the Senate and more than 100 in the House -- anti-abortion activists say the measure could be defeated.    &quot;Even if the bill somehow clears Congress without a satisfatory amendment, then pro-life forces can surely sustain a presidential veto,&quot; said Douglas Johnson, a spokeman for the National Right to Life Committee. </TEXT></DOC>
