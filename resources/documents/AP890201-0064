Many doctors, nurses and major unions expressed seriousreservations about the plan announced Tuesday by the Conservativegovernment. Some condemned it as an attempt to dismantle the system.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called the legislative proposalsthe ``most far-reaching reform of the National Health Service in its40-year history.''   Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke, the Cabinet member heading theservice, added: ``All our proposals share a common purpose _ to makethe health service a place where patients come first.''   But the opposition Labor Party accused the government of tryingto wreck the National Health Service.   Rodney Bickerstaffe, secretary of the National Union of PublicEmployees, one of the main health service unions, condemned it as``a cynical charter to dismember the National Health Service andtransplant Britain's health care in a commercial circus.''   The 650,000-member union represents hospital cleaners, porters,kitchen staff and other health service workers.   The British Medical Association said in a statement that it had``serious reservations about whether the proposals will produce thedesired improvements in the quality of services.''   Under the plan, the 320 largest and most sophisticated of the2,000 National Health Service hospitals can become independent in1991, taking fee-paying private patients and billing localauthorities for others.   The 320 self-governing hospitals under the government plan alsowill be able to charge patients for extras such as meals, privatetelephones or television.   For the first time too, private health insurance for the elderly,the biggest burden on the state system, will be tax-deductible.   The self-governing hospitals under the government plan will beable to attract quality staff, from consultants to cleaners, bysetting their own pay scales, the government said.   Other planned changes include fining general practitioners whoprescribe too many medicines.   Under the plan, family doctors with big practices will getseparate state budgets to buy drugs and hospital treatment fromprivate, state or self-governing hospitals for elective surgery.They will be allowed to keep half of any savings on the drugs budget.   Consultants and general practitioners will have their costsindependently audited and, like hospitals, will be encouraged tocompete for patients.   The plan, to be drafted as a government bill, needs parliamentaryapproval to become law. But the government's overwhelmingparliamentary majority ensures its passage and the entire package ofproposed changes is expected to be in force within three years.   The National Health Service came into operation on July 5, 1948,part of a wave of social legislation by Clement Attlee's Labor Partygovernment designed to give Britons a better post-war life.   The new plan is seen by some as an attempt to borrow from theAmerican health system, with its emphasis on private care, withoutincreasing spending.   The National Health Service operates alongside a smaller systemof private hospitals and other medical care. The private system isnot affected by the government plans unveiled Tuesday.   Government officials said the plan will streamline the healthbureaucracy, give the public wider choice but deny no one access tofree treatment.   Trevor Clay, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursingrepresenting health service nurses, said: ``I do not see muchconsumer choice in these proposals. ... As patients, we all have aprice tag on our heads now.   ``Some of this looks like a return to the elite voluntaryhospitals and local authority infirmaries when I first startednursing'' before World War II.   The National Health Service has 1 million staff. Used by 90percent of the population, it is generally popular and Mrs. Thatcherhas held back from exposing it to her strategy of rolling backsocialism. Instead, spending has increased by nearly one-third since1979 to $38.7 billion a year.</TEXT></DOC>
