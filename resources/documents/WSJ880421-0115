Cohen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> MKT AUT </IN><TEXT>   Lord, Einstein, O'Neill andamp; Partners won Saab Scania of North America's $30 million advertising account, marking a major coup for the upstart ad agency created last month by six former officers of Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein Inc.    The automobile account is the agency's first that didn't come directly from Lord Geller. The Saab account's $30 million in annual billings brings total billings for Lord Einstein to about $65 million.    The account was hotly pursued by such agencies as Messner, Vetere, Berger, Carey; Rosenfeld, Sirowitz, Humphrey and Strauss; and Ally andamp; Gargano Inc., which had held it since 1979.    For Saab, the switch to Lord Einstein is likely to result in a major shift in the company's marketing strategy. While Saab's sales growth is superior to that of most foreign car imports, the company's advertising has lacked a consistent theme that consumers could easily remember.    &quot;We absolutely need a consistent campaign,&quot; said Robert Sinclair, president of Saab Scania of North America, the U.S. marketing arm of Saab-Scania AB of Sweden.    &quot;Advertising for Saab right now is very important,&quot; said Christopher Cedegren, a senior analyst for J.D. Power andamp; Associates, an Agoura Hills, Calif.-based market research firm. In the competitive environment for imported cars, &quot;It will be tougher for Saab and others to increase business. They need good advertising to muster whatever small increase they can get.&quot;    Ally andamp; Gargano created advertising for Saab that called the autos &quot;The most intelligent cars ever built.&quot; The sporty, sleek cars range in price from $15,000 to $30,000, making Saab's major rivals such upscale auto makers as Mercedes Benz, BMW, Audi, Peugot and Volvo.    Marketing in the U.S. since 1959, Saab, like other foreign car makers, saw most of its growth in the past six years. Until last year, Saab experienced five straight years of record sales growth. Its largest market, analysts say, is Northeastern &quot;yuppies,&quot; although sales are quickly growing in the Sun Belt and on the West Coast.    The weak dollar and the stock market crash affected sales of all foreign car makers. Saab, however, is hurt less than most. For March, as an example, the number of cars it sold declined by 2% over the year-earlier period, while sales of all its major competitors fell more sharply.    Mr. Sinclair said that in the past year, &quot;I've become disenchanted&quot; with Ally andamp; Gargano, which merged with Marketing Corp. of America in 1986. He said the decline in sales wasn't a factor. &quot;I just thought that our advertising was no longer great,&quot; he said. Nearly all the original creative and account people who worked on Saab left the agency since the early years.    &quot;I feel good about what we've done as an agency for Saab,&quot; said Amil Gargano, chairman of Ally andamp; Gargano. &quot;I'm sorry they feel the work is not satisfactory.&quot;    Lord Einstein is involved in a major legal battle with Lord Geller and WPP Group PLC, the agency's parent. Mr. Sinclair said he was concerned about that, but received assurances from Richard Lord, chairman of Lord Einstein, that the new agency could service the Saab account.    With the addition of Saab, Lord Einstein has four clients. Last month, the New Yorker magazine and WNBC-TV left Lord Geller for Lord Einstein. International Business Machines Corp. also gave the agency some assignments. </TEXT></DOC>
