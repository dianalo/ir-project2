The department issued a statement that it ``understands'' adecision by British authorities in Hong Kong to incarcerate newlyarriving boat people as illegal aliens. Any arrivees who can'tprove they fled to avoid persecution will be sent back to Vietnam,according to the rules imposed on Tuesday.   Nearly 8,000 boat people have arrived in Hong Kong so far thisyear, compared to 650 for the same period in 1987, and the newmeasures are designed to deter more people from coming.   Hong Kong and other Southeast Asian nations have agreed to be``first asylum'' countries for refugees passing through on theirway to the West, but the flood of boat people is taxing theirwillingness, the department said.   In their defense, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Hong Konghave complained that the United States and other industrializednations that have promised to resettle refugees are not takingenough of them.   The State Department's statement _ aimed at all those countries,not just Kong Kong _ reflected resignation among U.S. experts thatSoutheast Asian nations are moving toward steps to stop the influxand concern that that the methods might be too harsh.   In recent months, for example, the United States has accusedThailand of pushing overcrowded and leaky boats with asylum-seekersback out to sea.   The department said it accepted the Hong Kong rules becauseauthorities had given assurances that:   _Arriving boat people will be let into the country, not pushedback to sea.   _Everyone who arrives will get a chance to apply for refugeestatus.   _Those whose applications are rejected ``will be housed inhumane and safe holding centers.''   ``In view of these firm assurances that the new policy will beimplemented in a reasonable and responsible manner, the UnitedStates understands the action which the British and Hong Kongauthorities have concluded they must take in order to preservefirst asylum for refugees,'' the department said.   ``We would expect that the screening program would apply UNHCR'scurrent criteria for determination of refugee status for Vietnameseboat people and that the Vietnamese would be informed of theirright to seek refugee status,'' the statement said.   ``We would be prepared to support the action of the British andHong Kong in that case,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
