Greenberger (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LATAM </CO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. may be hoisted on its own petard by El Salvadoran democracy.    In one sense, last week's overwhelming electoral victory by the far-right Nationalist Republican Alliance party, or Arena, capped years of U.S. efforts to nurture democracy in Central America. The municipal and legislative elections gave voice to public anger at the corruption of U.S.-backed Jose Napoleon Duarte's Christian Democrat government and at Mr. Duarte's inability to foster prosperty or peace.    &quot;I can't think of a better test than having a government in power run totally free elections and allow itself to lose them,&quot; says Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs.    But the election also raises the possibility that Arena's founder, Roberto d'Aubuisson, who is linked to the infamous death squads, could return to power. If he does, and brings on a resurgence of right-wing violence, Congress warns it will cut aid. Ultimately, the Reagan administration could have to abandon the showcase-nation of its Central America policy.    &quot;The downside will be if the more-extreme elements in Arena regain control of the party,&quot; concedes Mr. Abrams. &quot;That would have an impact on aid flowing to El Salvador.&quot;    The outcome will depend on the struggle for control of Arena between Mr. d'Aubuisson and the party's president, conservative businessman Alfredo Cristiani. Which man prevails will become clear as Arena asserts control over the National Assembly and El Salvador prepares for presidential elections a year from now.    Mr. d'Aubuisson, who lowered his public profile after losing the presidential race to Mr. Duarte in 1984, remains a formidable figure. His movie-star looks and macho style -- he campaigned in 1984 wearing tight dungarees with a pistol tucked in the waist -- win widespread rank-and-file support. For different reasons, he sends shivers up spines in Washington: Mr. D'aubuisson pushes a no-holds-barred policy against anyone suspected of being a leftist. A former major, he was kicked out of the army in 1979 for advocating the overthrow of the government.    Mr. Cristiani lacks charisma, but he has the support of many of the party's big donors. In Salvador's fundamentally conservative society, he attracts middle class voters who want a respectable alternative to Mr. Duarte's center-left party.    Most important, Mr. Cristiani gets bipartisan support from the U.S. Congress. During a recent trip here, he was seen as a responsible conservative who &quot;knows things have to be done to improve the life of the peasants,&quot; according to an aide to a liberal Democratic senator. He was told by Republican and Democratic members of the important Appropriations Committee that the re-emergence of Mr. D'Aubuisson would wreck U.S.-Salvadoran relations.    At home, Arena could use its new majority status to block, or even roll back, land-reform programs, says Enrique Baloyra, associate dean of the University of Miami's Graduate School of International Studies. Or, it could move to impeach Mr. Duarte, tying up his government for its remaining year.    But the party's darker side also could surface. The death squad apparatus -- the automobiles, hired killers and lists of &quot;subversive&quot; targets -- has never been dismantled. Most of the personnel remain in the military and many have been promoted in recent years. If Arena interprets its victory as a signal to crank up the grisly machinery, a blood bath could begin.    In the short run, leftists would be slaughtered. But in the long run, the U.S. would reduce assistance and retreat. Chaos would ensue and the highly organized Communist guerrilla army would be left to pick up the pieces.    Already, Congress is growing impatient with Mr. Duarte's inability to deliver on his promises. This year's foreign-aid bill imposes more restrictions on U.S. assistance than any since Mr. Duarte's election. For example, 10% of aid is being withheld to make sure the killers of several U.S. Marines in a 1985 terrorist attack aren't given amnesty; $5 million of military aid is being withheld until the killer of two U.S. labor advisers is brought to justice. The aid this year totals $337 million.    The message from Salvador's election may be that, after years of obsession with the Sandinistas, &quot;We'd better realize there is more than Nicaragua in Central America,&quot; says Prof. Baloyra. </TEXT></DOC>
