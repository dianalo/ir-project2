 The#3.6m project was launched three years ago, in 1986, to research into machinevision and neural networks.andP;  Carried out jointly by eight companies and theMinistry of Defence it has recently won continued funding by the Departmentof Trade and Industry for the next two years running to December 1 1991.andP;  Theproject embodies co-located research where industries and people create onecentre of resource, with British Telecom, British Aerospace, Pilkington,MEL/Philips, Thorn EMI, Plessey, STL and Smiths Industries each placing onerepresentative research scientist at Malvern.andP;  The companies will getexclusive rights to intellectual property generated by the project for twoyears after the end of the project.andP;  This will provide a commercial incentivefor the companies involved, even though the actual research is not directlyfor commercial use.andP;  The aim of the research is to teach computers to thinkwithout being formally programmed and thus to try to create a computer thatcan develop its own learning system that mimics the human reasoning process.andO;Machine vision and research into neural network computing have been combinedto form research into &quot;neural network learning systems&quot;.andP;  Machine visioncovers such things as robots with stereoscopic vision for distinguishingobjects.andP;  Neural networks are computers that use their own logic to reachsolutions rather than being programmed with a set of absolute rules.andP;  In aneural network there is a whole array of simple computing elements, eachconnected to several others by links of varying and initially randomstrengths.andP;  When data is input, initially garbage comes out the other end butby adjusting the strengths of the links, by the use of algorithms, afterseveral iterations that reinforce the &quot;correct&quot; links and weaken the rest, arecognised output can be obtained.andP;  The algorithms are formed by using theerror obtained when data is processed and the known output is compared withthe obtained output.andP;  A &quot;neural network learning system&quot; works by learning byexamples, and the learning capabilities of the system can be evaluated bypresenting it with unseen examples and noting how well it performs with them.andO;A conventional computer with a CPU and a memory, which reads instructions inthe form of a program, processes them and stores the data in memory, is verytime-consuming for complex problems compared with what seems to be promisedby neural networks.andP;  For example, Chase Manhattan Bank in New York hasinstalled a neural network learning system for use with credit card fraud.andO;It uses databases of financial information from various sources includingReuters.andP;  Each individual credit card holder develops a particular card-usagepattern and the computer learns the way in which the holdercharacteristically uses the card, taking into account small variations inusage.andP;  If the card is used abnormally, that means outside certain limits ofthe normal usage pattern, then the neural network, which has &quot;learned&quot; thatuser's idiosyncratic spending patterns by experience, can sense thevariation.andP;  It would be nearly impossible to program a conventional computerfor each particular card.andM;Diagnosing back problemsandM;Projects carried out at the Royal Signals Research Establishment include amedical diagnostic system.andP;  A pilot such system has already been produced,which can distinguish between the four categories of back pain when apatient's symptoms are input.andP;  A doctor followed patients with back problemsfor two years, training a computer with their medical records.andP;  The systemproved that neural networks could be trained to give accurate diagnosis andare sometimes better at it than a human doctor in particular areas ofmedicine.andP;  Another neural network at Malvern was taught to read with theJanet andamp; John books.andP;  The computer was taught in much the same way as a childwould learn, by starting with a few words and gradually building up itsvocabularly to approximately 10,000 words.andP;  A variety of hardware is used,including workstations and personal computers for smaller networks andTransputer parallel networked systems for larger problems.andP;  The next twoyears will be focussed mainly on further research into neural networks whichare believed to be the next step in improving computer intelligence.andP;  -andO;Elvadia Tolputt</TEXT></DOC>
