The complaint was filed with the Belgrade district attorney'soffice under a section of the Yugoslav criminal code that forbids``public humiliation'' of foreign countries or their leaders.   Borba said Friday that the penalty for violating the law is upto three years imprisonment.   The newspaper said the complaint was filed against StanislavMarinkovic, editor of Borba; Vesna Roganovic, a journalist for thepaper, and Slobodan Selenic, a popular Yugoslav author.   Selenic, head of the Yugoslav Writers' Union, was sued becauseof a statement to Borba last month about ``Khomeini's frighteningthreat'' against Rushdie, Borba said. Marinkovic and Roganovic werecited for allowing the novel to be published, the newspaper said.   A Yugoslav secretary who answered the telephone at the IranianEmbassy said no one was available for comment. The holy month ofRamadan began a week ago.   Whether Khomeini will have his own day in a Yugoslav court wasnot clear. Borba said several Yugoslav lawyers were representingKhomeini.   Parts of ``The Satanic Verses'' considered offensive to someMoslems include a bordello scene in which prostitutes take thenames of Mohammed's wives, and the suggestion that the prophetwrote the holy Koran instead of receiving it from Allah.   The book has caused protests worldwide, and demonstrations overits publication have led to the deaths of at least 19 people inPakistan and India. Two London bookstores in central London wereset afire Sunday in an apparent campaign of intimidation aimed atstopping sales of the book.   London detectives refused to say whether more threats ofviolence have been received, but Scotland Yard said in a statementFriday night: ``Last Sunday's incidents may be the start of acampaign against premises which sell, publicize or make availableSalman Rushdie's novel `The Satanic Verses.'''   Rushdie, a 41-year-old British citizen born in Bombay, India, toMoslem parents, went into hiding after Khomeini issued hisexecution order Feb. 14.</TEXT></DOC>
