Traders, their arms flailing, bumped and bulldozed forposition as the closing bell capped one of the most volatiledays ever in the Merc's crude-oil pits.</LP><TEXT>   Most traders, hoarse and sweaty, were in no mood to gab asthey sized up their trading positions.   &quot;Your throat hurts, your feet hurt -- you take a realphysical pounding,&quot; said George Gero, a 20-year veterancommodity trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   When the dust settled, the September crude-oil contracthad jumped $1.57 a barrel, to $23.11, after leaping as highas $23.80. That's the biggest one-day rise since April 1989,and the highest closing price for crude oil since January.   Oil traders thrive on gyrating prices, and there wasplenty of that yesterday as the markets reacted to Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait. There is fear that world oil supplieswill be disrupted; the two countries are among the biggestoil producers. Together, Iraq and Kuwait represent more than20% of the output of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries.   But the Merc's rough-and-tumble local traders, who jump inand out of the market trading for their own accounts, don'tkeep their eyes glued to the newswires that flash above theirheads on electronic screens..   &quot;The best way to do it is to go with your instincts, to gowith the trading flow,&quot; says Lee Fader, a local trader at theMerc. &quot;You try to keep rumors out of your head,&quot; he says,adding: &quot;Rumors get you hurt.&quot;   Some locals, for instance, trade on the basis of the pricespreads between oil contracts expiring months apart. Othersuse byzantine technical charts to determine when they buy andsell. Still others size up the feel of the trading pits forclues, watching other traders' body language or facialexpressions to sense a change in price direction.   Trading volume of 121,893 contracts at the Merc'scrude-oil ring fell far short of a record, however. That'sbecause many contracts quickly jumped the daily $1-a-barrellimit; only the nearby September contract was free to movemore than $1. This means that many traders who had positionsin other contract months weren't able to wiggle out of them.   On the elevator at the Merc, traders shook their heads andsized up the damage. &quot;I'm not a happy puppy,&quot; said oneglum-faced trader to his buddy. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; chirped hiscompanion. &quot;You're young.&quot;   But oil wasn't the only hot spot in New York's commoditypits yesterday. Gold prices, after surging more than $13during the day, closed at $376.80 an ounce, up $3.50 at thenearby Commodity Exchange here. Volume was a heavy 65,000contracts.   Many traders were betting that rising oil prices wouldlead to higher inflation. And many people view gold as aninflation hedge.   &quot;The first flight {by nervous investors} came into gold,&quot;says Prudential-Bache's Mr. Gero.   What about tomorrow's trading? Look for somewhat lowerprices, some traders said, partly because oil and gold closedwell off their highs for the day. But no one was quitewilling to bet big on it yet.   Says Mr. Fader, the local trader: &quot;It's a crapshoot.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
