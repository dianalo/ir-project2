(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Open SNAandM;IBM's interoperability strategy is a synthesis of vision and practically.andO;IBM fully supports the migration to OSI, which has the potential to become anideal interoperability solution for heterogenerous systems and networks.andO;Meanwhile, IBM embraces the best available de facto industry standards, suchas TCP/IP and NFS (Network File System), to satisfy customers' immediaterequirements.andP;  SAA's (System Application Architecture) CCS (CommonCommunications Support) remains flexible to adapt to changing systemtechnology and meet customers' future needs.andM;Standardization has many benefits for the industry; however, open-systemsarchitecture is a double-edged sword.andP;  It offers incredible businessopportunities for IBM and IBM Business Partners who can provide systemsintegration solutions, but it also opens many doors to IBM's competition.andP;  Asa result, niche players will often beat IBM on the common turf of opensystems.andP;  Nevertheless, long-term gains, via increases of overall marketpotential in a climate of open systems, should far more than offset any earlylosses suffered by IBM.andP;  In this respect, IBM cannot be accused ofsacrificing long-run success for immediate gain.andM;IBM's Open Communication Architectures (OCA) signaled the beginning of a newopenness in IBM systems.andP;  OCA, announced September 1986, led to aninteroperability expansion that would potentially encompass all IBM and majornon-IBM systems.andP;  The &quot;not invented here&quot; posture of old would be temperedand then bent.andM;The changes were necessary.andP;  During the 1980s, shifts in prevailing systemarchitectures increasingly emphasized networking, distributed computing, andother advanced communications.andP;  The pace of systems change had accelerated.andO;IBM needed new approaches to maintain competitiveness and profitability.andM;The impact of changing system architectures at major IBM accounts waswitnessed by Allan Eiseman, vice president of EJR Computer Assoc.andP;  (Hoboken,N.J.), a systems-consulting firm.andP;  &quot;At one time, almost all clients haduniform system architectures and very similar technical requirements--mostlyblue.andP;  The many different system platforms in use today, along withnetworking, have added a great deal of technical diversity and complexity,&quot;says Eiseman.andM;&quot;A crying need for interoperability has been apparent for some time,&quot; ChrisMauro, EJR's technical director, agrees.andM;Evolution to SAAandM;OCA extended the benefits of Systems Network Architecture (SNA) and relatedarchitectures into mixed IBM and non-IBM environments.andP;  SNA is IBM's premiernetwork standard.andP;  The purpose of extending SNA via OCA was to interconnectcommunication networks, attach a variety of communication products to SNA,use public data networks, and bring SNA services to a variety of attacheddevices.andP;  Attached non-SNA components would include PBXs, LANs, T-1multiplexers, and similar products that support voice, data, image, orinformation flow.andP;  SNA network management was specifically applied to TokenRing LANs in IBM's September 1986 announcements.andP;  SNA would be the boss, incharge of network management from the centralized focal point of NetView.andO;The goal of IBM network management became end-to-end control of allcomponents in a mixed SNA and non-SNA network of IBM and non-IBM products.andM;In 1986, IBM had opened up SNA: Users could attach their communicationproducts to SNA, and SNA network-management capabilities could manage thecomponents of SNA, non-SNA, and Token Ring networks.andP;  In addition, IBM hadpublished manuals describing SNA and related architectures, plus itsimplementations of the CCITT Recommendations X.21 and X.25 for public datanetworks, as well as provided supplemental support for SNA and relatedarchitectures.andP;  Perhaps the name of IBM's flagship network should have beenchanged to Open Systems Network Architecture.andM;SAA was announced in March 1987, six months after OCA.andP;  Its major objectiveis to define interfaces, conventions, and protocols that form a framework forsoftware consistency across all IBM computing environments.andM;A typical 1987 IBM customer began running a mix of mainframes, midrangeprocessors, and PCs (or PS/2s).andP;  The need for connectivity andinter-operability across these architecturally different IBM computingplatforms had become apparent to IBM long ago.andP;  Communications support withinSAA was chosen largely from SNA and international standards, in accordancewith OCA.andP;  A consistent communication architecture design makesinterconnection of applications, systems, communication networks, and deviceseasier.andP;  SAA contains the building blocks for distributed functionality.andO;Those building blocks can span and connect all major IBM system platforms viacommunications.andP;  Communication support within SAA was cast as flexible ratherthan rigid.andP;  Additional communication architectures were to be evaluated overtime for possible inclusion.andP;  This malleability within SAA set the stage forIBM to expand Big Blue communications and networking far beyond the SNAstandard.andM;Once SAA had been defined to ensure consistency, connectivity, andinteroperability across IBM's multiple-architecture computer systems, linkingIBM to non-IBM computer systems had to be addressed.andP;  IBM customers were notonly running IBM mainframes, mid-range processors, and PCs but also asubstantial number of non-IBM-compatible systems.andP;  The days of pure true-blueshops had become history, and IBM's challenge was to cope with IBM-to-non-IBMinteroperability, which would keep customers happy and maintain accountcontrol.andM;Why SAA?andM;IBM announced SAA as &quot;a collection of selected software interfaces,conventions, and protocols,&quot; intended to be a framework for the design,development, and implementation of consistent applications across all majorIBM system platforms.andP;  At the time of the announcement, IBM system platformsconsisted of System/370, System/3X, and the PC.andM;In past decades, diverse IBM systems have grown different underlying systemarchitectures.andP;  Their base hardware and operating-system platforms arelargely incompatible.andP;  Given the advance of technology during the platforms'evolutions, IBM chose not to focus on maintaining a homogenous architectureacross the board.andP;  Instead, the emphasis was on delivering products with ahigh price and performance level optimized for a particular market segment.andM;Successful IBM system architectures become entrenched for decades.andO;System/360 architecture, which spawned the System/370 architecture thatprevails today on IBM mainframes, is nearly 30 years old.andP;  The investmentmade by IBM, end-user companies, and other software and hardware vendors inexisting products for each architecture is vast.andP;  SAA's objective is to tietogether IBM's multiple architectures in a manner that assures consistencyacross the different platforms.andP;  In the future, new architectures will alsobe consistent via SAA compliance.andM;From the broadest perspective, SAA has two parts: the software foundation andthe framework.andP;  The software foundation is IBM's approach for structuring thecore of products and software and is used consistently in all SAAenvironments.andP;  The software foundation has three parts.andP;  The first isapplication enablers--compilers and database programs used by applicationsystems.andP;  Second, communications programs such as VTAM (in ESA/370 and VM)and the communications modules of OS/2 EE and OS/400 allow the system tocommunication with the attached devices or other systems in a network.andP;  Thethird part consists of system-control programs--the operating system and itsextensions in a given hardware environment.andM;The software foundation differs for every IBM system architecture (Figure 1).andO;While SAA foundation products are uniquely designed for a given hardwareplatform, the SAA framework is the common denominator across all major IBMSAA systems.andP;  The framework also consists of three elements.andP;  The Common UserAccess (CUA) defines conventions for developing consistent end-userinterfaces for SAA applications.andP;  It also allows the user to interact with acomputer consistently, regardless of its SAA foundation.andP;  The CommonProgramming Interface (CPI) defines languages and services for programmers touse in writing application programs.andP;  Programs written in accordance with CPIcan run in all SAA architectures with little or no change.andP;  Finally, theCommon Communications Support (CCS) defines communication architectures andprotocols that interconnect SAA systems and devices and allow data to beinterchanged among them.andM;Application programs written to CPI and CUA are referred to as commonapplications.andP;  Common applications will increasingly use direct access to CCSfunctions as application systems continue to become more network-oriented.andO;The major advantage of common applications is that they run in all SAAenvironments and present the same user interface in each.andM;The practicality behind SAA is that CUA, CPI, and CCS work together, so theunderlying foundation of different system platforms does not obstructconsistency, connectivity, or interoperability.andP;  Their cooperativefunctionality and interdependence will become increasingly important ascomputing environments continue to evolve toward &quot;distributed&quot; systems onnetworks.andM;Common CommunicationsandM;CCS plays the key role in networking computers, by providing consistency incommunications across different IBM platforms and allowing networks to bebuilt with systems across the entire spectrum of SAA products, ranging frommainframes to PCs.andP;  Its architectures and protocols support standardcommunication among devices, application programs, systems, and networks.andM;IBM recognizes and emphasized the importance of standards, says RobertSpaziano, consulting support representative in the IBM TelecommunicationSystems Center (Raleigh, N.C.).andP;  &quot;By adhering to industry standards, IBM canprovide a much better solution to connectivity and interoperability thanwould otherwise be possible with proprietary approaches,&quot; Spaziano says.andM;No wonder, then, that CCS consists of IBM protocols and selectedinternational standards that allow interconnection of IBM and non-IBMsystems.andP;  These protocols and standards include SNA, CCITT recommendations,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards, and partsof the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) standards.andP;  Six elements composeCCS: data-link control, network services, session services, applicationservices, objects, and data streams.andM;Data-link control: A data link is made up of transmission media and adata-link control protocol.andP;  Transmission media includes some combination oftelephone lines, microwave beams, fiber optics, satellite links, coaxialcables, and twisted pair.andP;  The control protocls interpret control data andspecify how to transmit data across the link.andP;  The data link is theconnectivity link; LANs, telecommunication links, or packet-switched datanetworks can interconnect SAA systems.andP;  CCS architecture supports data linkcontrol for SNA, or for SNA and OSI.andM;SNA supports Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) and IBM Token Ringarchitecture.andP;  SDLC interconnects SAA systems over a wide area; Token Ringconnects SAA systems over LANs.andP;  SDLC is a proper subset of ISO's High-LevelData Link Control.andP;  IBM Token Ring architecture is based on IEEE 802.2 and802.5 and ISO 8802-2 and 8805-5 standards.andP;  SNA and OSI can use X.25 toaccess packet-switched data networks that support both SNA-to-SNA andOSI-to-OSI connections.andP;  The IBM interface to X.25 corresponds to CCITTRecommendation X.25.andM;Network services: Network services support connectivity between systems inthe SNA and OSI archtectures.andP;  Under SNA, Node Type 2.1 arcitecture provideslow-level networking for direct connectivity between two SAA systems on apeer-to-peer basis, meaning that either of the communicating systems canactivate sessions.andP;  SNA Node Type 2.1 architecture supports CCS data-linkcontrols such as SDLC, Token Ring, and X.25.andM;CCS-supported OSI network services include Connectionless-Mode NetworkServices (CLNS) USING THE ISO 8473 standard and Connection-Oriented NetworkServices (CONS) using the Subnet Interface to X.25 (ISO 8878).andP;  In CLNS, datais tranferred on a best-try approach.andP;  CONS uses integrity controls toattempt error-free data transfer.andM;Session services: These services establish communication, support datatransfer, and allow termination of communication between application programson a network.andP;  This process is referred to as program-to-programcommunication.andP;  Session services for SNA are provided by SNA Logical UnitType 6.2 (LU6.2) architecture, a program-to-program communication protocolthat uses SNA Node Type 2.1 architecture for routing connections.andM;Session services for OSI are provided by the transport, session, andpresentation layers.andP;  The transport layer ensures end-to-end data integrity,and CCS supports Class 0 (no error recovery), Class 2 (multiplexing), andClass 4 (error detection, recovery, and multiplexing).andP;  CCS also supports allfunctional units for the session layer, versions 1 and 2 (ISO 8327).andO;Finally, the presentation layer establishes connections, transfer data, andterminates presentation services (ISO 8823); Abstract Synax Notation One(ASN.andP;  1) defines a veriety of data types and structures.andP;  It also providesan encoding scheme to transfer data between open systems (ISO 8825).andM;Although the means differ, the ends of SNA and OSI session services aresimilar.andP;  OSI session services allow users on different networks tocommunicate and exchange data.andP;  Likewise, LU6.2 provides a logical interfacefor access to different SNA and SNA-based system resources.andM;Application services: Architectures allowing data distribution, documentinterchange, electronic messaging, and network management make networks moreuseful.andP;  CCS architectures that provide application services are either SNA-or OSI-based.andM;One architecture providing application services for SNA is the documentinterchange architecture, a program-to-program architecture that allowsdocuments to be interchanged across a spectrum of SAA-based office systemsand offers a set of protocols defining common office functions to beperformed cooperatively by different network systems.andM;Another is SNA/Distribution Services (SNA/DS), a general-purpose,connectionless communication service used by application programs formessaging.andP;  With connectionless services, a direct connection or sessionbetween nodes or programs is not necessary.andP;  SNA/DS can provide asynchronousdistribution capability across SNA so active sesions are not needed betweenend points.andM;Other architectures are SNA/Management Services, which enable IBM and non-IBMproducts to manage networks consistently; and Distributed Data Management(DDM), which allows files to be shared among SAA systems.andP;  Itsdata-connectivity language makes exchanging data across different systemarchitectures easier.andP;  It also defines communication facilities andinterfaces and manages the routing of requests, replies, and data.andP;  Ineffect, it allows files to be shared among SAA systems, and itsdata-connectivity language makes it easier to exchange data across differentsystem architectures.andM;A new level of DDM, level 3 architecture, was announced last June to supportDistributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA).andP;  Leve 3 includes astandardized relational database model and a SQL application manager.andP;  Thisprotocol lets a user access distributed and relational data regardless ofwhere it resides.andP;  This extends SQL from one system to a network of systems.andO;DRDA is built upon LU6.2, DDM Formatted Data Object Content Architecture(FD:OCA), and Character Data Representation Architecture (CDRA).andM;For OSI, the CCS application services include three components.andP;  FileTransfer, Access, and Management (FTAM) is the OSI 8571 standardard fortransferring and accessing files among heterogeneous computer systems.andP;  X.400Message Handling System, CCITT's 1984 version of X.400, was the first OSIstandard for exchanging electronic mail among open systems.andP;  It definesformats and protocols for messaging between users.andP;  OSI Association ControlService Elements (ACSE) consist of service elements that offer broadcommunication functionality typically required by most application programs.andO;ACSE are analogous to common program subroutines.andM;Objects: To transfer a document to other SAA systems, the document must bestructured to allow interpretation by each system.andP;  Object ContentArchitectures (OCA) make such transfers easier by defining the structure andcontent of objects that can exist within the document.andP;  OCAs in CCS includepresentation text object content architecture, image object contentarchitecture, graphics object content architecture, font object contentarchitecture, and formatted data object content architecture.andM;Object can be categorized as data objects for resoure objects.andP;  A compounddocument might contain differnt data types, such as text, graphics, andimages.andP;  Data types are contained in data objects--text, graphics, and imageobjects.andP;  Data objects reference resource objects, such as font objects.andO;Applications can transmit objects via data streams and store them inlibraries.andM;Data Streams: A data stream is a continuous, ordered stream of data elementsin a set format.andP;  Application programs may generate data streams to be sentto anther workstation, application program, or printer (local or remote).andO;Differnt data streams supported in CCS include:andM;* 3270 data stream--formatted data stream that transmits data between anapplication program and a nonprogrammable workstation or printer;andM;* Intelligent printer data stream--system-to-printer data stream forall-points-addressable printing;andM;* Mixed objects--Document Content Architecture (DCA) that transmits objectsfrom an application program to a programmable workstation or anotherapplication program;andM;* Revisable-form-text--DCA that transmits revisable-form text betweenapplication programs in an office environment; andandM;* CDRA--manages the graphic character integrity across any pair of SAAdatabase-management systems.andM;OSI SupportandM;Within CCS, OSI is the strategic vehicle for providing communication betweenIBM and non-IBM systems.andP;  Supporting formal international standards, such asOSI, opens the door to common interfaces, protocols, formats, and contents,whereby systems integration becomes feasible in a multivendor environment.andO;IBM has stated that its OSI products are designed to work with other vendors'OSI implementations.andP;  IBM's vision of the multivendor environment takes intoaccound regional differences throughout the world.andP;  For example, the IBMOSI/Communications Subsytem products support OSI protocols specified in theU.S.andP;  Government Open Systems Interconnect Profile (GOSIP), United Kingdom'sGOSIP, CEN/CENELEC, and CEPT.andM;IBM's VTAM version 3 OSI remote programming-interface feature (for MVS/ESA,MVS/XA, and VM/SP) provides the same programming interface as theOSI/Communications Subsystem.andP;  With it, an SNA system can run OSIapplications without an installed OSI/Communications Subsystem.andP;  Through theVTAM OSI remote-programming interface, that SNA system can access another SNAsystem running the OSI/Communications Subsystem to provide multivendor OSIcommunications.andP;  The VTAM OSI remote programming interface uses LU6.i tocommunicate with the OSI/Communications Subsystem.andP;  This environment lets OSIand SNA applications shares SNA resources.andM;In June 190, IBM began shipping OSI/File Services release 1 for MVS, whichprovides file transfer and management between open systems in a multivendorenvironment.andP;  The product is based on the OSI FTAM standard and others.andM;Although SNA is the major achitecture for IBM-to-IBM networking, IBM makes itclear that SNA and OSI are integrated to co-exist.andP;  IBM uses its OSI productsto support communication between IBM and non-IBM systems; those products alsoprovide added value over and above conformance with OSI standards.andP;  In thisinstance, &quot;added value&quot; means network management by NetView.andM;Through the OSI/Communicatins Subsystem for MVS and VM Program Products,NetView manages SNA and OSI networks as well as IBM and non-IBM nodes in anOSI network.andP;  The transport and data-link control functions provided by SNAand Network Control Program products allow both SNA and OSI traffic to shareadapters and connections.andP;  For OSI systems, Virtual Telecommunications AccessMethod and NCP participate in the detection and forwarding of networkmanagement information to NetView in the same manner as for SNa systems.andM;&quot;NetView has a strong base and is functionally suited for managing both IBMand non-IBM networks,&quot; says Marc Holstein, a network-management expert onWall Street.andP;  However, establishing centralized management of diversenetworks inside any large company is a different story.andP;  &quot;The barriers arepolitical rather than technical, due to decentralized control of differentnetworks across the organization chart,&quot; he continues.andM;IBM's June 199 &quot;OSI Position Statement&quot; provided additional insights intoSAA-OSI and AIX-OSI product direction and support for OSI standards.andP;  TheSAA-OSI Interrelationship has many noteworthy points.andP;  First, while SNA andOSI are now only integrated up to the data-link layer, OSI and SNA willeventually be integrated into one network.andP;  NetView will manage and controlOSI, SNA, TCP/IP, asynchronous distribution through SNA/DS, and X.400.andO;OfficeVision for VM and MVS support X.400 through the X.400 PROFS connectionprogram and the X.400 DISOSS connection program, respectively.andP;  A subset ofthe OSI X.500 directory standard is supported under the current version ofthe OSI/Communications Subsystem.andP;  IBM intends to expand and enchance thedirectory services.andM;Within the OSI/Communications Subsystem and OSI file services, additionalemphasis will be placed on supporting multivendor OSI implementationsworldwide through various international OSI profiles.andP;  Finally, TCP/IPdirection and support will be provided through application-layerprotocol-translation functions (via IBM application gateways) between SMTPandX.400 and also FTP and FTAM.andP;  In addition, IBM is investigating Telnet tovirtual terminal translation and network layer gateways.andP;  Adual-protocol-stack capacity will simplify TCP-IP-OSI translation.andM;IBM acknowledged the need for OSI support on AIX systems consistent withAIX-SAA interoperability (see &quot;Settling the Frontier,&quot; page 32).andP;  TargetedOSI features include connectivity, implementation of OSI layers 3 through 7applications (ACSE, FTAM and X.400 MHS), and network management.andP;  AIX-OSIwill be supported on X.25, ISO 8802-3, and 8802-5 networks.andP;  In the AIXenvironment, OSI manager functions through NetView will be optional to CMISand CMIP agent functions.andP;  FTAM and X.400 are other &quot;gives&quot; for AIX systems.andM;IBM OSI products for AIX systems are not a distant hope.andP;  AIX Open-SystemsInterconnection Messaging and Filing/6000 (AIX OSIMF/6000) will be availableat the end of 1990.andP;  The new product provides AIX version 3 for RISCSystem/6000 users with X.400 and FTAM; the ability to communicate with otherOSI systems over X.25, ISO 8802-3 or 8802-5 networks; bi-directionalapplication gateways to SMTP and FTP services; a transport-services API; anOSI stack of layer 3 through 7 functions; concurrent operation with AIX v.3;and support of U.S.andP;  GOSIP version 1, U.K.andP;  GOSIP version 3, and EUropeanprofiles.andM;Targeting TCP/IPandM;Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a set of layeredcommunication protocols, designed specifically for multivendor connectivityand interoperability.andP;  TCP/IP contains high-level communication applications,such as terminal emulation (Telnet), file transfer (FTP), and electronic mail(SMTP).andM;Today, the Department of Defense (DoD), leading universities, anddefense-department contractors commonly use TCP/IP.andP;  Many vendors, includingIBM, support TCP/IP.andP;  For end-user companies, it represents an attractiveinterim solution to multivendor connectivity and interoperability until OSIprotocols are fully developed and tested.andP;  Frank Dzubeck, president and chiefexecutive officer of Communications Network Architects (Washington, D.C.)andO;describes TCP/IP implementations as &quot;pervasive on almost every platform andconformed to as a standard,&quot; in contrast to OSI, which is incomplete inimplementation and not prevalent yet.andM;IBM and its Business Partners offer TCP/IP for MVS, VM, PS/2, the AIX familyof Unix products, AS/400, and System 3/X.andP;  Most IBM implementations of TCP/IPinclude the Requests for Comments (RFC) and public domain functions, such asNFS and X Windows, a Unix-based windows manager.andM;Current TCP/IP implementations do not provide all the communication functionrequired by end-user companies.andP;  Furthermore, some vendors' implementationsdon't work together completely.andP;  The OSI protocols, once finished, will bericher in function than TCP/IP.andP;  OSI will also provide more network andapplication components to satisfy a wider range of end user needs.andO;Interoperability among different vendors will improve because of conformancetesting specified by organizations such as the Corporation for Open Systems.andM;The layered architecture of TCP/IP is similar in functionality to that ofOSI, particularly at OSI layers 1 and 2,3 and 4, and 7.andP;  At layers 1 and 2,both TCP/IP and OSI support Ethernet, Token Ring, and X-25.andP;  At layers 3 and4, the TCP and IP layers have functions similar to OSI's transport andnetwork layers.andP;  At layer 7, TCP/IP and OSI compare respectively as follows:SMTP and X.400 for electronic mail; FTP and FTAM for file transfer; andTelnet and OSI Virtual Terminal Protocol for terminal emulation.andM;&quot;OSI systems will start to be seriously implemented at end-user companies asearly as 1992,&quot; says Edward Hanssen, group manager of personal systems in theGuide IBM user group.andP;  At least until then, IBM will support TCP/IP as aninterim solution.andP;  IBM will eventually migrate its TCP/IP systems to OSI inaccordance with the DoD's GOSIP requirement.andM;Meanwhile, TCP/IP and SNA networks will co-exist and interoperate.andP;  Forexample, TCP/IP networks can be connected over an SNA backbone; TCP/IP userscan log onto IBM SNA hosts using Telnet through an IBM gateway host with bothTCP/IP and SNA installed; and application gateway products provide mailtransfer between SMTP and PROFS or DISOSS.andP;  In addition, IBM is participatingin a National Science Foundation project to manage the NSFNet's TCP/IPbackbone with NetView.andM;IBM products, such as TCP/IP for VM and OS/2 Extended Edition, reflect howseriously IBM regards TCP/IP.andP;  TCP/IP version 2 for VM will allow a VM userto communicate with other systems in a TCP/IP network.andP;  SNMP links the latestversion of TCP/IP for VM with NetView, so Netview can manage TCP/IP networksas well as SNA.andP;  IBM's statement of direction indicates similar SNMP featuresforthcoming in TCP/IP for MVS.andP;  Resource Access Control Facility support forNFS server and Kerberos authentication services, support for dynamic RIP, andenhanced socket and RPC libraries (including Apollo NCS) are among many newlyannounced features.andP;  Supported protocols include IEEE 802.5 and 802.3, X.25,and IBM PC Network.andM;TCP/IP 1.1 for OS/2 EE enables OS/2 EE nodes to communicate with othersystems on the TCP/IP network.andP;  Noteworthy features are NFS Client, clientsupport for Serial Line Internet Protocol, and FTP API.andM;Other StandardsandM;IBM has implemented Ethernet on IBM hardware and software platforms,including the latest PC-based LAN servers and workstations.andP;  Ethernet issupported in the Communications Manager for OS/2 EE 1.2 nodes, and in the LANSupport Program 1.2 for DOS-based nodes.andP;  Access to SNA-based hosts fromEthernet workstations is possible through various IBM 3270 gateways.andP;  IBMalso actively markets the Ungermann-Bass NICps/2 Adapter 1542 for Ethernet.andM;The IBM 9370 mid-range processor attaches to Ethernet, and the IBM 8209 LANBridge connects IEEE 802.3 and Ethernet to IBM Token Ring.andP;  Through the 8209,a Token Ring backbone can connect multiple Ethernet segments; conversely, anEthernet backbone can connect multiple Token Rings.andP;  Ethernet and Token Ringtraffic will co-exist across the two LAN topologies (but devices cannotcommunicate without a common high-level protocol across the integratednetworks).andM;Neither the IBM announcements nor the SAA materials discuss interoperabilitywith PC-DOS.andP;  OS/2 EE is clearly designated as the strategic operating systemfor IBM PCs.andP;  Some industry-watches believe that over time, DOS will becomemore like a downscaled OS/2.andP;  Perhaps Windows 3.X or 4.X will become alow-end entry for SAA's CUA.andP;  Meanwhile, de facto interoperability standards,including TCP/IP, are supported under PC-DOS.andM;NetBIOS is another missing link in SAA.andP;  On NetBIOS LANs, IBM defines SAAterritory up to IEEE 802.2, which sits below NetBIOS.andP;  However, NetBIOSprovides an important interface for SAA's OS/2 EE LAN Requester and LANServer, as well as for the IBM DOS-based LAN systems.andM;IBM markets Novell's Advanced Netware 286 v.2.15.andP;  At the Token Ringworkstation, Novell's IPX can use the IEEE 802.2 interface in IBM's LANSupport Program.andP;  Also, the NetWare workstation shell gracefully runsside-by-side with IBM's DOS-based LAN systems, such as PC LAN and DOS LANRequester, and other IBM LAN-oriented communication programs.andM;An IBM Business Partner, Interlink Computer Sciences (Fremont, Calif.), sellsa Software Network Solution (SNS) SNA/Gateway for communication between DECand SNA networks that provides complete bidirectional interaction between SNAand DECnet.andP;  IBM MVS and VM nodes can participate as peers in DECnet and actas gateways for DECnet nodes to access resources in SNA as peer notes.andP;  SNSSNA/ Gateway looks at DECnet as though it were part of SNA, so protocols likeTCP/IP are not required for the gateway function.andP;  An additional feature isLU6.2 support, which allows IBM and DEC LU6.2 applications to communicatewith one another.andP;  DEC-net users can access IBM hosts and the SNA environmentthrough the Digital Command Language.andP;  Likewise, native mode CMS and TSOcommand sets can access DECnet nodes connected to the IBM host via the IBM8232 LAN Channel Station, the IBM 3172 Interconnected Controller, or the IEEE802.3 IBM LAN Adapter for ES/9370.andM;IBM's announced set of Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) 3.0 productsis directed at manufacturing and process-industry customers.andP;  They supportplant-host, area, and cell-controller functions.andP;  The IBM OSI/MMS provideManufacturing Message Specification, ACSE, and MAP 3.0 APIs.andP;  Access to theMAP 3.0 network will be available through IBM distributed-automation editionproducts, which support both proprietary and MAP interfaces for smoothoperational integration down to the plant floor.andM;ISDN support includes access to the ISDN transport through the IBM 7820basic-rate terminal adapter.andP;  The IBM Token Ring bridge program version 2.2supports the IBM 7820 ISDN terminal adapter attachment for interconnectingremote Token rings.andM;Robert Panza is a LAN consultant affiliated  with EJR Computer Assoc.,andO;Hoboken, N.J., and The Systems expert, Woodbury, Conn.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
