On Feb.11, 1979, nine days after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,nemisis of the Shah of Shahs, returned to Tehran in triumph from 15years of exile, his bearded revolutionaries seized the reins ofgovernment when the last monarchist government collapsed.   Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had already gone into exile Jan. 16,his 40-year reign on the Peacock Throne imploding in anarchy, hisimperial regime notorious for corruption and torture. Khomeini'syears in power have, by many accounts, been a mirror image.   Nonethless, many of Iran's 50 million people will take to thestreets this week to mark the anniversary of the Islamic revolutionas the country stumbles, at last, out of a decade behind the darkIslamic veil of self-imposed isolation.   But beneath that mood of celebration, the country faces a futureof political uncertainty, exhaustion from the conflict with itsancient Arab enemy, deep economic malaise and debate about whichpath the revolution must now take.   There are some indications of the direction the revolution ismoving under Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, the country'sleading pragmatist and, for the time being at least, the mostpowerful figure after Khomeini.   Acknowledging that revolutionary zealotry unnecessarily estrangedIran from the rest of the world, he is the driving force behindmoves to the isolation that began with the November 1979 seizure ofthe U.S. embassy and deepened with Tehran's support for anti-WesternShiite terrorism and hostage-taking in Lebanon.   He also acknowledged in October that the revolution, the warnotwithstanding, has also failed to improve conditions for the``mostathafin,'' or the dispossessed, in whose name the revolutionwas waged.   ``We still have not been able to clarify for people economicbenefits as befits Islam, as we have differences of opinion amongourselves over these issues,'' he said. ``We have not yet tackledthe day-to-day aspects of Islamic rule.''   Above all, Iranians are increasingly obsessed with how muchlonger Khomeini will live and what will happen when he dies.   The stern-faced Shiite Moslem spiritual leader, father of therevolution and its undisputed authority, is 88 years old andreported in poor health, rarely venturing from his heavily guardedresidence in the Jamaran suburb of north Tehran, where the shah'selite once lived.   When he dies, Iran faces a power struggle between its leadersthat some Iranians fear could even start a civil war.   Most political analysts believe that the revolution will survivethat expected turmoil, but that its ideological makeup will likelyundergo considerable change, depending on which faction comes out ontop.   For the time being, Rafsanjani and his allies, who includePresident Ali Khamenei, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati andKhomeini's son, Ahmed, who controls access to his ailing father inhis north Tehran stronghold, appear to have the upper hand.   But they face stiff challenges in the days ahead from hardlinerssuch as Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, Prime MinisterHussein Musavi and others who fear his policies are eroding therevolution's Islamic purity.   ``The revolution has endured and it's there to stay,'' saidHans-Heino Kopietz, a seasoned analyst of Iranian affairs with theLondon-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.   ``But revolutions do not remain rigid for very long because thereare too many internal pressures,'' he said in a telephone interview.   ``A civil war after Khomeini dies is a possibility. The powercenter in Tehran will probably be strong enough to prevent Iran'spolarizing, but the revolution will have to redefine itself if it isto survive.''   Philip Robbins, an analyst with London's Royal Institute forInternational Affairs, said, ``Outsiders have focused largely on thenegative aspects of the last 10 years in Iran _ its failure in thewar and in the economy, two of its flagship policies. But therevolution has done more than just get rid of the shah. Iran is nowvery much its own boss. It has asserted its independence veryforcefully.   ``Whether or not you like the regime, its self-confidence andsurvival have to be recognized.''   The war with Iraq, in which by some Western estimates 1 millionIranians were killed and tens of thousands maimed, was a unifyingforce that muted the bickering in the hierarchy and maintainedrevolutionary momentum.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
