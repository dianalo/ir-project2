 The new AS/400 9402Models C04 and C06, running under OS/400 Release 3 will be available in theUS from September 28, except for 7855 modem support, which is planned for thefirst quarter of 1991.andP;  Main storage can be increased from 8Mb to 12Mb on theModel C04 and to 16Mb on the Model C06.andP;  Disk capacity can also be increasedfrom 640Mb to 960Mb on Model C04, and to 1.28Gb on Model C06.andP;  A workstationcontroller - either ASCII or twinaxial - is available on the Model C06, andother options on both models include a 5.25&quot; disk unit, a 9348 half inch tapeattachment feature and a battery backup unit.andP;  Both models provide for theoptional attachment of up to five communication lines and either a Token-RingNetwork adaptor or EthernetIEEE local area network adaptor.andM;Base UnitandM;The base system unit of each model contains the system processor,input-output processor, 8Mb of main storage, two new 3.5&quot; 320Mb disk units,one 120Mb quarter inch cartridge tape unit, either a twinaxial or ASCIIworkstation controller and a communications adaptor.andP;  The multifunction inputoutput processor provides support for disk storage, disk, cartridge tape,printers and displays, and one or two communication line ports.andP;  The 7855modem is designed to work with the remote power-on capability and the secondcommunication line port, which is optional, can be featured with either anEIA 232/V.24 adaptor or an X21.andP;  The maximum aggregate operating rate forboth lines is 21.6Kbps, but both lines cannot run concurrently when one runseither X25 or the SDLC X21 Short Hold Mode protocols.andP;  The 320Mb disk unitsuse thin film technology in a 3.5&quot; design, and average seek time is 12.5mS,average latency is 7.0mS; they first appeared on the RS/6000.andP;  The 120Mbcartridge tape unit is a streaming quarter inch tape cartridge unit thatprovides alternate initial program load, save, restore and data interchangewith 9402 Model Y10, Models C04, C06 and 9404 System Units with the standard120Mb cartridge tape unit, the 9346 cartridge tape unit on the 9406, and the120Mb High Capacity Internal Streaming Tape Drive on the System 36 5363 orAS/Entry 5363 system.andP;  Read-only support is provided for cartridges writtenby the System/36 5363 53Mb Cartridge Tape Unit and the 6157 in System 36format.andP;  Instantaneous data rate of the 120Mb cartridge tape unit isapproximately 90K-bytes per second.andP;  Base twinaxial support providesattachment of up to 14 5250-type workstations to two ports with a maximum ofseven devices per port, and base ASCII support provides six ports.andP;  Each portcan support one workstation or a display with a display attached auxilliaryprinter for a maximum of 12 devices or two devices per port.andP;  Either EIA232/V.24 or EIA 422-A interfaces are supported from any of the ASCII ports atspeeds up to 38,400bps, and the EIA 422-A interface allows local attachmentof devices with cable lengths of up to 3,600 feet.andP;  The EIA 232 interfaceallows either local attachment of devices with cable lengths up to 50 feetand remote devices are supported via point-to-point asynchronous duplexmodems that may be switched at speeds up to 19,200bps.andP;  Data buffering is notsupported.andM;Communications, Storage and CostsandM;The 9402 has a range of communications functions, including SNA, X25, X21,Token-Ring, Ethernet/IEEE 802.3, and several multiple environments.andP;  Thevarious protocols include ASYNC, BSC, SDLC, X25 and IEEE 802.2 LLC.andP;  The 9402can support five communications lines and one local area network.andP;  The C04system with 8Mb is $14,500, and the C06 is $17,500.andP;  The battery back-up is$787, the local area adaptor is $4,000, and the Token-Ring Adaptor is $3,675.andO;The magnetic tape unit adaptor costs $2,500, 4Mb main storage is $4,500, andthe 320Mb disk unit is $5,500.andP;  The 5.25&quot; disk unit is $945, and thethree-line communication controller is $2,100.andP;  Features for the C06 onlyinclude the 120Mb cartridge tape unit at $2,400, and 4Mb main storageexpansion which costs $4,500.andP;  The twinaxial workstation controller is$2,310, as is the ASCII controller, and the ASCII 12 port attachment costs$1,365.andM;Baby 9402 - 5363-based Model Y10AS/Entry 9402 Model Y10 is an entry systembased on AS/Entry 5363 processor and technology.andP;  It operates under underRelease 6 of the System 36 System Support Program and is upgradeable to tothe Model C06.andP;  The 9402 Model Y10 base unit costs $11,000 and is availablein the US from October 26, 1990.andP;  IBM says that the Model Y10 provides 50%more disk storage than the current As/Entry 5363 Model S10, Y10, and System36 application software will run on the Y10, although it does not support the5363 Optical Subsystem.andP;  The base Model Y10 includes 1Mb of main storage,160Mb of disk capacity, and supports up to 14 twinaxial workstations.andP;  Mainstorage can be increased to 2Mb, 640Mb of disk capacity, and the number ofworkstations can be increased to 28.andP;  Up to three communication lines may beadded to support X25, async, bisync and SDLC protocols, and a 16Mbps or 4MbpsToken-Ring Network adaptor and battery power unit are also available.andP;  Thesystem may be remotely powered on via a telephone call.andP;  The disk drive canread and write System 36 extended format 5.25&quot; disks only, which are notinterchangeable with personal computer disks.andP;  They are used for loadingprograms on the system unit as well as saving and restoring data.andP;  TheWorkstation Controller has four ports and supports up to 14 local twinaxialworkstations attached directly, or either via the 5209 Link ProtocolConverter or via the 5208 ASCII Link Protocol Converter.andP;  The base systemunit with 1Mb storage is $11,000, additional disk capacity of 160Mb is$3,000, and the workstation expansion is $2,270.andP;  2Mb main storage is $1,125,the processor expansion is $1,650, and A 120Mb cartridge tape unit costs$2,400.andP;  To convert from the 9402 Model Y10 to C06 is $10,500, and to go fromthe 160Mb disk unit to 320Mb costs $2,500.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
