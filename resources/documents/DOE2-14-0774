Waste classification is a mechanism that can help ensurethat overall performance objectives established to protect public healthand safety, will be met. DOE has adopted ICRP 30 and ICRP 48 as the basesfor all internal dose calculations. For LLW management, DOE is requiringequivalency with Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requirements. However,system- wide classification will be less practical for DOE than NRC becauseof dissimilarities of waste mixtures between DOE sites. Site-specificwaste stream characterization, source-term determination, and radiologicalperformance assessment will be required for DOE disposal facilities todetermine the maximum disposal capacity and the most efficient disposalpractices for defense LLW. This process will also demonstrate compliancewith the overall performance objectives, thus providing for public healthand safety. This paper discusses the procedure that DOE is consideringin the development of a site- and waste-specific LLW classification systemfor DOE defense wastes. 10 refs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
