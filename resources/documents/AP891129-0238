After more than 20 years of pressure and persuasion, and somerecent improvement in the trade balance, Washington is zeroing inon what many experts say has been the issue all along: Realprogress depends on changing the way the Japanese do business.   ``Japan's systems for buying and distributing goods are thebiggest obstacle facing U.S. manufacturers who export or dobusiness in Japan,'' R.K. Morris, director of international tradepolicy for the National Association of Manufacturers, recently tolda U.S. Senate committee in Washington.   With Japan accounting for 40 percent of the U.S. trade deficitlast year, the imbalance hasn't fallen as far as it should havegiven the weakening of the dollar against the yen, U.S. officialssay.   Behind the arcane trade rules once used to keep imports out liesan even more formidable challenge _ ``keiretsu,'' or networks offinancial and personal ties that bind Japanese subcontractor tomanufacturer to wholesaler to retailer, in almost impenetrablealliances.   U.S. officials expressed disappointment after talks inWashington in November at which Japanese officials said they would``advise'' firms to end practices keeping foreign companies out oftheir market, but warned that quick change was unlikely.   ``There was very little flexibility in the Japanese governmentposition ... in reaching common ground on the nature of theproblems, even problems which appear to be widely recognized inJapan,'' U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary Charles Dallara saidafter the talks.   Japan's insular, exclusive business culture and the lifestyleand tastes of its discriminating consumers lie outside governmentjurisdiction.   In most cases, but certainly not all, a foreigner hoping to sellto Japan no longer faces obvious legal barriers, U.S. officialssay. Quotas and excessive duties on alcohol, beef, citrus and manyother products have been negotiated out of existence.   Vociferous complaints and lengthy trade talks also have helpedto end the strange restrictions like those that once judgedforeign-made skis ``unsuitable'' for Japanese snow.   Instead, foreign and Japanese businessmen trying to sell newproducts here face alliances of Japan's most powerful firms _ ledby Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuyo (Fuji), Sanwa and Dai-IchiKangyo _ each with its own banks, retailers and real estate,insurance and manufacturing companies.   These are the ``keiretsu,'' and there are some 30 smaller onesas well. Through interlocking holdings, they own more than 70percent of shares on Japan's stock markets.   Cartels by any other name, the keiretsu enable competingmanufacturers to fix prices and divide markets among themselves _activities that would be illegal under antitrust laws in the UnitedStates or Europe but provoke only mild government warnings here.   According to a study by the American Chamber of Commerce inJapan, almost 48 percent of home electronics in Japan are soldthrough exclusively affiliated stores and 99 percent of cars aredistributed through exclusive dealerships.   The keiretsu are looser versions of the industrial combines, or``zaibatsu,'' of wartime Japan.   Japan's commercial armies are the nation's economic defense.Only Japanese products carry the guarantee of being returned to thewholesaler if they don't sell. Imports don't. Through sucharrangements, Japanese manufacturers keep 1.6 million retailers inbusiness. The United States, with 25 times the area and twice thepopulation, has only 1.4 million.   The Japanese retailer survives this inefficiency by charging theworld's highest prices.   A recent survey by the Japanese and U.S. governments found 84 of122 items priced in both countries were excessively expensive inJapan, including food, wine, cosmetics, bed linens, golf clubs andspark plugs.   Americans, in contrast, paid more for ketchup, perfume, tablechina, household batteries and Japanese-made electronics goods.Some people think Sonys and Panasonics are cheaper in the UnitedStates, but the surveyors did find bargains at discount stores inJapan.   Surprisingly, pressure for change has come not from Japan'slong-suffering consumers but from foreigners and other``outsiders'' _ new Japanese entrants into established markets.   Large-scale retailers are fighting the regulations that limittheir expansion to protect small stores. Industrialists are callingfor opening Japan's farm markets. Even some rice farmers in Japan'smost productive areas, confident of their ability to compete, havebegun to rail against government restrictions.   Supporters of change have found a willing but quiet ally inJapan's anti-monopoly watchdog, the Fair Trade Commission, whichhas long done little but issue warnings to violators of antitrustlaws.   In recent months, the Fair Trade Commission has finedcontractors involved in a price cartel, investigated price gapsbetween Japan and other countries, and issued warnings to computermanufacturers that bid one yen _ less than a penny _ to wincontracts from local governments.   The commission last year recommended steps to encourage moresupermarkets and department stores, which tend to import more thanmom and pop shops. It said they should be allowed to have morefloor space and stay open past 7 p.m., the normal closing time.   The panel recommended deregulating sales of alcohol and liftingother government controls that limit competition and drive upprices in the airline, banking, insurance and transport industries.   U.S. officials say a myriad of restrictions, most not apparentuntil they are violated by foreign exporters, exist at all levelsof the Japanese economy.   Japan faces possible retaliation under the U.S. Super 301 tradebill for tariffs and housing standards that limit imports of woodproducts and for government procurement policies that limitpurchases of U.S.-made supercomputers and satellites.   Recent trade figures indicate foreign firms are making inroadshere, despite the odds. Japan's prices mean high profits for thoseimporters who manage to crack the barriers, and more are acquiringthe expertise to do so.   The U.S. deficit with Japan remains high: it is expected to beabout $50 billion this year, compared to $55 billion in 1988 andalmost $60 billion in the peak year of 1987, according to U.S.Commerce Department figures.   But U.S. exporters are trying harder. American exports to Japanso far this year are up almost 19 percent.   Japan is importing more finished, higher-value products that canmake a bigger dent in the surplus than cheap raw materials. In1980, only 22 percent of Japan's imports were finished products. In1988, almost half were, according to Finance Ministry figures.   Despite high costs, language and cultural barriers anddifficulties in recruiting top employees, many foreign companieshave done very well in the Japanese market.   Schick razors, Nestle instant coffee, Kellogg's corn flakes, Luxsoap, Contac cold medicine, Pampers disposable diapers, Snickerscandy, Kleenex and other foreign brands, through trial and error,have won hard-earned places on Japanese store shelves.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 3</NOTE></DOC>
