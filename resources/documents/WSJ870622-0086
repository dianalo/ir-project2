Barnes and Laura LandroStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JWT MCA MER SBTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)MARKETING, ADVERTISING (MKT) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   JWT Group Inc. executives have been holding talks with at least three companies about taking the advertising concern private in a leveraged buyout, sources close to JWT said.    Separately, Quantum Media Inc., a media and entertainment concern affiliated with MCA Inc., said it owns 4.7% of JWT's about 10 million common shares outstanding.    The sources said JWT is considering a leveraged buyout as an alternative to a friendly $50.50-a-share merger proposal from WPP Group PLC, a London-based marketing-services concern. The bid is valued at about $515 million. On Friday, WPP extended the expiration deadline on its proposal to 12:01 p.m. EDT today.    Last week, JWT said its directors would consider the WPP bid and alternatives to the offer, including seeking a friendly merger partner, taking the company private or buying back shares. WPP and JWT since have held preliminary talks.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Sources close to JWT said that Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. is one of the three concerns considering organizing a leveraged buyout of JWT. Merrill Lynch officials declined to comment.    Among other companies, MCA and Salomon Brothers Inc. last week expressed interest in discussing a joint friendly acquisition of JWT. But sources close to the company said Salomon and MCA, a Los Angeles real estate and entertainment concern, canceled meetings without explanation last week, prompting speculation that they won't proceed with acquisition talks.    A source close to JWT said that if JWT directors approve a leveraged buyout of the company, JWT likely would spin off some operations to pay debt. JWT's main subsidiaries are J. Walter Thompson Co. and Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein Inc., advertising agencies; Hill andamp; Knowlton Inc., a public relations concern, and MRB Group Inc., a market research unit.    A WPP spokesman said of the leveraged buyout reports, &quot;If this is true, then it would be most disturbing. They said we would get a fair hearing.&quot; He said that WPP has requested access to information being provided to all possible JWT suitors and that JWT had said that its financial advisers would meet with WPP officials. &quot;Neither of those has happened,&quot; the spokesman said.    He added that WPP remains &quot;flexible&quot; in negotiating a friendly acquisition of JWT. He declined to comment on whether WPP would consider increasing its $50.50-a-share proposal or would increase its $45-a-share hostile offer for JWT shares, which was rejected by JWT directors last week but which remains in effect.    A JWT spokesman declined to comment.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, JWT stock closed Friday at $52 a share, down 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
