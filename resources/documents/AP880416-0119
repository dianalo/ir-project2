Jesse Helms, R-N.C., on Saturday said thenew U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms reduction treaty will cost thetaxpayers billions of dollars, contradicting a congressional reportthat said the pact would save money.   Helms, a leading opponent of the treaty which would eliminatethe two superpowers' medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe,said the United States would have to strengthen its conventionalforces to counterbalance Soviet forces in Warsaw Pact nations.   Thus, he estimated the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treatywould cost taxpayers between $258 billion and $326 billion over the13-year life of the pact.   ``Most Americans are unaware of the price tag on this treatybecause the administration, particularly the Department of Defense,has gone out of its way to cover up the taxpayer expense,'' Helmssaid in a statement accompanying a draft of a report by theRepublican staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   Helms, the ranking minority member of the committee, contradictsa report, released April 6 by the General Accounting Office,Congress' watchdog agency. It said the treaty would save about $1.7billion through the fall of 1995.   The GAO said the savings will come because the Pentagon will nolonger need to maintain its Pershing and ground-launched cruisemissile force in Western Europe. It said money will also be savedon associated costs for military personnel, procurement andconstruction of housing for military family members.   However, Helms' committee report, using the GAO data and otherinformation from the Congressional Budget Office and the Army,re-evaluated the costs and savings associated with the treaty.   Department of Defense ``end-strengths will remain the same, oreven increase, since compensating steps will have to be taken torepair NATO defenses in Europe once the INF systems have beeneliminated,'' the Republican report said.   And, Helms said even if the United States does not boost itsconvential forces in Europe, ``the treaty would still cost at least$36.6 billion'' to scrap missiles, to guard against Soviet cheatingand to keep track of Soviet personnel assigned to monitor treatycompliance.   Helms said the Soviets will have costs too but said, ``in theirslave-labor economy, their expense will be insignificant whencompared with ours.''   The treaty was endorsed last month in lopsided votes by both theSenate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees and awaits avote in the full Senate.   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has refused tocall it up for a vote until a dispute is resolved over whether thetreaty covers futuristic weapons such as lasers. The administrationhas been pressing for ratification before the May 29-June 2superpower summit meeting in Moscow.</TEXT></DOC>
