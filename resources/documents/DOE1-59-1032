The prices and benefits of the methodsand the costs of the combinations were compared. The false negative rateof one single method varied from 11.8 to 20.9%, with two methods therate was 3.7 to 7.1%, and with three methods 2.5 to 3.9%. With four methodsno improvement in the results was noted. As a single method, fine needleaspiration biopsy was the cheapest, but it also had the highest falsenegative rate. The combination of clinical examination, mammography,and fine needle aspiration biopsy seemed to be the most accurate andreasonable combination for diagnosis.</TEXT></DOC>
