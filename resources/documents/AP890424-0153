King Hussein did not namea successor immediately.   In an official statement read on state television, Husseincalled for ``a comprehensive national review'' that would ``makeeach citizen feel we are in a period of complete reorganization.''   He did not say when a replacement would be named for Rifai, a52-year-old boyhood friend of the king who was educated in theUnited States and had been prime minister since 1985.   Hussein assigned secretaries-general of government ministries,second in rank to appointed ministers, to run their departmentsuntil a new government is formed.   Four days of riots in which at least nine people were killedbegan April 18 in the southern city of Maan and spread to dozens ofcities and towns. Many rioters called for Rifai's ouster but alsoshouted support for the king.   Officials said the toll rose to nine with the death Mondayevening of an air force major shot during riots in the town ofMazar.   Many Jordanians blame the prime minister for declining livingstandards. Annual per capita income has fallen from $2,000 in themid-1980s to about $1,200.   Last year, the government imposed import controls and austeritymeasures to help deal meet payments on a foreign debt of $6 billion.   Riots were precipitated by price increases of 10 percent to 50percent on gasoline, cigarettes and other goods decreed as part ofa debt-rescheduling plan worked out with the International MonetaryFund.   The king, who cut short a foreign tour, expressed his intentionSunday ``to deal with the roots of the problem and all the causesand reasons ... within a short period of time,'' the officialJordan News Agency reported.   Hussein appeared to refer to the rioters' complaints when heurged the secretaries-general in his statement to ``put an end toabuse and misuse,'' but also praised Rifai and his government for``carrying your responsibilites with honesty and your honestefforts to achieve the goals we set for our country.''   He hinted that economic belt-tightening would continue, but alsoat an effort to spread the impact of the hardships.   ``We have to divide the responsibility and the burden until westand solidly on our feet,'' Hussein said.   No Jordanian prime minister has served longer than Rifai sinceindependence from Britain in 1946. Besides the term that began inApril 1985, he also was prime minister from 1973 to 1976.   Educated at Columbia and Harvard, Rifai earlier served asambassador to Britain and as chief of the royal court.   His father, Samir, served six terms as prime minister in the1940s, 1950s and 1960s, for a total of less than four years.   Last week's eruption of violence was the worst in Jordan sincethe army crushed Palestinian guerrillas in 1971.   Various Jordanian groups have demanded reforms, new economicpolicies, parliamentary elections and action against officialcorruption.   More than 100 people have been arrested in recent days toprevent further demonstrations, said Laith Shubeilat, head of theCouncil of Presidents of Jordan's professional associations.   He said most were Communist Party members, but several membersof the Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation ofPalestine also were arrested. He said others outside of thosegroups, including former parliamentary deputy Riad Nawaiseh ofKerak, were also arrested.   Shubeilat said the associations planned to send a cable to theking urging the government to withdraw an arrest warrant againstGeorge Haddadin, head of the Geologists Union and a member of theDemocratic Front of Jordan, allied to the Marxist Democratic Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine.   Haddadin said he believed he was wanted because he was among theassociation leaders who signed a petition to the palace Saturdaycalling for a new elected government.</TEXT></DOC>
