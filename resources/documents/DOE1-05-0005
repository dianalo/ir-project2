Laser isused in various areas including laser processing, optical communications,optical memory and medical diagnosis. Changes in production of lasersclassified by type and application areas are shown. Concerning the laserprocesses, a review is made of the laser processing and the excimer laserprocess, which are a typical thermal process and a photo-excitation process,respectively. furthermore, recent studies for developing excimer lasersare described, centering on major applications such as laser doping,laser etching and thin film production by laser CVD (chemical vapor deposition),for which active investigations have been carried out. The major topicson laser application technologies in the field of energy include theresearch and development of techniques for uranium isotope separation.Other research and development activities are under way in pursuit ofenhancing the functions of the existing lasers or providing novel typesof lasers. It is also expected that new application techniques will emerge.(7 figs, 3 tabs, 8 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
