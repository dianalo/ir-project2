The concept of marketing cars by visiting customers' homes is very common in Japan, and it was used in the U.S. to some extent until the 1950s. But only a few U.S. dealerships still try to sell cars that way, and they only attempt it periodically when showroom traffic plunges.    Toyota's Lexus models are expected to carry price tags ranging from $22,000 to $35,000, easily qualifying them as luxury cars. When Toyota launches the new line by September 1989, Mr. Hendrick, who will be one of 97 Lexus dealers, will have the only dealership in the Carolinas. To reach major markets in those states outside his Charlotte headquarters, where he will have a Lexus showroom, Mr. Hendrick plans to employ sales representatives in 10 cities, such as Raleigh, N.C., that have a population of at least 100,000.    The representatives will identify potential Lexus customers, call them on the telephone to set up an appointment and then personally bring a car to their home or office for the prospect to examine -- and, it is hoped, buy.    &quot;What we're going to try to do is sell cars through direct mail and through cold calls and making appointments,&quot; Mr. Hendrick said at a news conference sponsored by Automotive News, a trade publication. &quot;I don't know if it will work or not. But I know Toyota does well in Japan, and I think people like to be pampered.&quot;    Mr. Hendrick said he isn't currently planning to use the sales technique for his other franchises, which include Honda Motor Co.'s upscale Acura division, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz.    A Lexus spokesman in Torrance, Calif., said he knows of no other Lexus dealers taking a similar approach. But he said the company will watch Mr. Hendrick's progress to see if the idea works in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
