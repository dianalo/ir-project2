As expected, Mr. Bush vetoed the $6.4 billion measureFriday, saying it would &quot;destroy the integrity&quot; of lastyear's budget agreement and might increase unemployment byhaving &quot;a negative effect on financial markets that couldthreaten economic recovery.&quot; The legislation would provide asmany as 20 weeks of additional aid to jobless workers whohave exhausted the basic 26 weeks of state-provided benefits.</LP><TEXT>   The president promised he would sign a &quot;responsible&quot;benefits extension such as the less costly alternative backedin the Senate by Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas.   Though congressional Democrats promised an immediateeffort to override the veto, it won't be easy to break Mr.Bush's unblemished record of 22 successful vetoes. TheSenate's final 65-35 vote fell two votes short of thetwo-thirds majority needed for an override, although thefinal 300-118 margin in the House exceeded a two-thirdsmajority.   Democrats attacked the timing as well as the substance ofMr. Bush's action, asserting that he sought to minimize thepolitical fallout by vetoing the bill while the nation wasriveted on the sensational Senate Judiciary Committeehearings into sexual-harassment allegations against SupremeCourt nominee Clarence Thomas.   &quot;If he thought no one would notice, he's wrong,&quot; saidHouse Majority Leader Richard Gephardt. &quot;George Bush tookadvantage of this day to turn his back on millions of joblessAmericans who have no way to buy groceries for their kids.&quot;   Echoing a familiar criticism, Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell said the president is more willing to assistbeleaguered foreigners in Turkey or Israel than to helpAmericans in difficulty. Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, anannounced Democratic presidential candidate, accused thepresident of &quot;callous disregard for the 8.4 million Americansout of work.&quot;   Hoping to deflect such criticism, the White House hassought in recent days to portray Mr. Bush as concerned aboutthe U.S. economy's slow recovery and as taking a more activerole in seeking solutions. The president has held severalhigh-profile meetings with economic advisers and reiteratedhis support for incentives to economic growth such as a cutin the capital gains tax. In addition, the TreasuryDepartment last week announced regulatory steps intended toencourage easier credit.</TEXT></DOC>
