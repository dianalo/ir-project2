Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6935 marks,even with its level late Monday in New York. The U.S. unitalso was trading at 134.80 yen, up from 134.63 yen. Sterlingfetched $1.7295, down from $1.7325.</LP><TEXT>   In Tokyo early Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 134.83yen, up a bit from Tokyo's Tuesday close of 134.75 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6960 marks, upfrom 1.6903 marks on Tuesday.   &quot;It was a cautious trading day,&quot; with traders unwilling tomake aggressive moves in either direction, said Ian Spence,managing director of interbank trading at ManufacturersHanover Trust in New York.   &quot;The market is still overwhelmingly bearish&quot; andanticipates a reduction in U.S. interest rates, he said.   Foreign exchange dealers expect a cut to 5.0% from 5.5% inthe U.S. discount rate, the Fed's least expensive form oflending. They also anticipate a quarter-percentage-pointreduction to 5.25% in the target for federal funds. Thefederal funds rate is the rate that banks charge one anotherfor overnight loans.   But the market's bearish mood doesn't mean the dollar willmove lower over the next few days, Mr. Spence added. In fact,several traders are predicting the dollar will move slightlyhigher later in the week, and will rally strongly no matterwhat the Fed does with U.S. interest rates.   A signal that rates are leveling off would cause heavycovering of short, or oversold, dollar positions because theexpected rate cut is already priced into the dollar'sexchange rates, said Albert Soria, first vice president andforeign exchange manager in New York for Kansallis OsakePankki, Finland's largest commercial bank.   &quot;It'll be a blood bath&quot; because so many traders have soldshort in anticipation of lower U.S. rates, Mr. Soria said. Byselling a currency short, a player bets that it will drop andthat it can be bought back at a profit at lower levels.   If the Fed does cut rates as the market expects, &quot;thedollar should rebound nicely,&quot; Mr. Soria added.   Traders expect the dollar to remain near current levelsuntil tomorrow, when U.S. producer price data for August andweekly money supply data might yield clues to the futuredirection of U.S. interest rates.   August consumer price and retail sales data on Fridaycould provide the final cue for the Fed to lower U.S.interest rates, traders said.   Technical chart support is pegged at 1.6850 marks,yesterday's intraday low, with resistance at 1.7000 marks and1.7050 marks, traders said.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $349.90 an ounce, down $1.20. Estimatedvolume was a moderate 2.5 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Wednesday, gold was quoted at $350 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
