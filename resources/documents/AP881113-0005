(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Freed hostage Mithileshwar Singh saidhis months in the captivity of Islamic fundamentalist kidnappersleft no emotional scars, but he feels guilt that his friends arestill being held, and believes much of the fault lies with theReagan administration.   In an interview published in the Sunday editions of TheJournal-News of Nyack, N.Y., Singh said he wonders what is holdingup the liberation of nine remaining American hostages in Lebanon.   ``I see French hostages; they're all out. I look to Germanhostages; they're all out. I'm happy for all of them. But we havenot done something to get (the Americans released),'' Singh said inthe interview Friday.   ``If somehow we could unfreeze our positions it would help,'' headded. ``Negotiations do not mean concessions.''   Nine Americans are among the 14 foreigners being held hostage inLebanon.   Singh, 61, was released Oct. 3 by Moslem extremists who had beenholding him hostage for 20 months. Three of his American colleaguesfrom Beirut University College, Jesse Turner, Alann Steen and RobertPolhill, remain in captivity.   ``After you stay so long, for so many hours, with so manyfriends, you are out and they are still behind. You feel a sense ofguilt,'' Singh said.   However, the captivity left ``no mental, no physical scar of anykind,'' the Indian citizen, who is a legal resident of the UnitedStates, said at the Stony Point Center. He has stayed at the retreatand conference center run by the United Presbyterian Church sincereturning to the United States.   Singh had been in the Lebanese capital since 1982 working aschairman of the business department at Beirut University College. Heand his colleagues were kidnapped on the night of Jan. 24, 1987,when armed men showed up at a meeting they attended.   ``The treatment could be characterized as relatively better thanwe had anticipated,'' he said. The captors provided playing cardsand chess sets for their amusement, decent food and adequate medicalcare.   ``The four of us kept together. That was an integral part of thewhole thing,'' Singh recalled. ``We were able to discuss, able toanalyze, we were able to share each other's frustrations,disappointments and hopes and aspirations.''</TEXT></DOC>
