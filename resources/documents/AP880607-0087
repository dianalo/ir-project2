The appeal, carried by the Palestinian news agency Wafa, was madeto the Arab chiefs of state who begin a three-day emergency summitmeeting in Algiers tonight.   The summit was to be devoted to solidifying support for thePalestinian uprising among the 21 Arab League members.   The underground leaders of the uprising _ which involves mainlyPalestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza _ said allthe Arab nations surrounding Israel should ``open their borders toPalestinian combatants.''   The appeal was directed mainly at Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, thethree nations represented at the summit that have a common borderwith Israel. All three, fearing Israeli reprisals, have taken actionto prevent guerrilla attacks on Israel across their borders.   Algeria prepared a spectacular welcome for King Hassan II ofMorocco, who arrived on a luxury liner in the Bay of Algiers. Hisvisit marks the two North African Arab neighbors' reconciliationafter 12 years of hostility.   Algeria and Morocco resumed diplomatic relations May 16 afterdeciding to put aside their dispute over the Western Sahara, atleast for now.   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi arrived this afternoon, escorted byfemale bodyguards and wearing a gold-embroidered white kaftan. Ablack-and-white Palestinian khafia in the colors of the PalestineLiberation Organization was draped around his neck.   In a statement distributed by Libya's official news agency JANAon the eve of the summit, Gadhafi accused unidentified Arab leadersof ``acting under specific instructions from the U.S. StateDepartment.''   ``The possibility of denouncing these leaders before thePalestinian people and the Arab nation will perhaps be the onlypositive point of this summit,'' Gadhafi declared.   President Hafez Assad of Syria and President Amin Gemayel ofLebanon were among the last to arrive. PLO chairman Yasser Arafat,King Hussein of Jordan and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia flew in Monday.   The underground leaders ``exhorted the Arab chiefs of state toallow Palestinians living in the Arab countries to take part in thestruggle against the Zionist enemy,'' Wafa said.   The uprising's leadership also demanded joint Arab action to give``international protection'' to the Palestinian people and todemolish all ``suspect peace plans,'' such as that of Secretary ofState George P. Shultz. Today, he ended a four-day tour of theregion to promote the plan.   An international peace conference with full representation of thePLO remains the only way to ``a durable, just and global peace,''the underground leaders declared.   The United States and Israel officially regard the PLO as aterrorist organization and seek to bar it from any role in the peaceprocess.   PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif said Monday in Algiers that theShultz plan was ``born dead.''   He said the PLO was not only demanding money to compensate forloss of income due to protest strikes in the West Bank and GazaStrip, but other forms of support such as food shipments.   He said political support for the rioting should include aunified stand by the conferees, rejecting the latest U.S. peaceinitiative and reiterating ``their endorsement of the PLO as thesole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, insideand outside the occupied terroritories.''   Arab League officials and diplomats said the summit will alsotouch on other key problems facing the Arab world, such as theIran-Iraq war and the conflict in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
