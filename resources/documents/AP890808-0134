The meeting, which lasted just over two hours, ended without anyapparent agreement being reached. A union representative, whodeclined to give her name, refused to comment about the proceedingsas the meeting ended. A Bell Atlantic representative would only saythat the two sides were clarifying and evaluating the issues in anattempt to resolve the three-day contract dispute.   Barred by court injunction from mass picketing, strikingtelephone workers marched in limited numbers Tuesday outside BellAtlantic buildings in six states and the nation's capital.   The strike at Bell Atlantic was part of a nationwide walkoutthat involved two other regional Bell companies _ NYNEX Corp.,which operates in New York and New England, and Pacific Telesis, inCalifornia and Nevada.   In all, about 157,000 union workers in 15 states and theDistrict of Columbia were on strike, forcing management to worklong hours in such jobs as answering directory assistance queries.   The companies urged people to dial direct when possible and nomajor delays were reported for those calling without operatorassistance.   The Bell Atlantic strike has idled 52,000 workers, including41,000 members of the Communications Workers of America inPennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, WestVirginia and the District of Columbia. Another 11,000 workers aremembers of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers inPennsylvania and New Jersey.   No talks have been scheduled with the IBEW, and no talks werescheduled in the other two strikes.   ``We're pleased the CWA accepted our offer to come back to thetable,'' Christopher Clouser, Bell Atlantic vice president forcorporate relations, said in a prepared statement. ``Itdemonstrates the CWA's good faith in reaching an equitable, timelyagreement.''   Bob Bickers, a CWA spokesman, said before the meeting that thecompany had requested the session to informally discuss items thatwere already on the table.   Five IBEW pickets were arrested Monday in Philadelphia forallegedly violating the mass picketing ban, but were dischargedafter a brief hearing before Common Pleas Judge Samuel Lehrer.   Joan Toth, president and business agent for Local 1944, saidthere was confusion at the time of their arrest because their unionwasn't named in the injunction.   Michael Kaine, a Bell of Pennsylvania spokesman, said the unionlater agreed to abide by the order and not force the company to goto court again.   Meantime, the flow of telephone service _ most of it automatedand handled by computers _ continued at a near normal level.   ``Management employees are doing their best to maintain servicelevels as close to normal as they can,'' said Bell of Pennsylvaniaspokesman Thomas Duddy. ``There is some slowness in gettingdirectory assistance and in operator assistance for toll calls inour area of service.   ``But everything else which is automated is working fine. Thestrike is having no effect on basic services, like telephone callsfrom homes to homes and business to business.''   John Schaer, spokesman for Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Coin Alexandria, Va., said Tuesday, ``Things are going pretty much asexpected. Directory assistance is a little slow, and we're notdoing installations as we would regularly. We're not at 100 percentbut that was not to be expected.''</TEXT></DOC>
