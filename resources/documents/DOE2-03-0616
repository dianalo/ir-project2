<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-03-0616 </DOCNO><TEXT>Laboratory studies and two field evaluations have been completed to assessthe formulation and performance of the Semi-Volatile Organic SamplingTrain (Semi-VOST) method for measuring concentrations of principal organichazardous constituents (POHCs) with boiling points greater than 100{sup0}C emitted from hazardous waste incineration. Laboratory experimentswere performed initially to design and test a dynamic spiking systemto allow spiking of test compounds in the field for a reliable procedureto assess method precision and bias. Additional laboratory tests wereperformed to determine analytical method detection limits to estimatethe levels at which deuterium labeled compounds should be spiked underfield conditions. Compounds representative of a variety of chemical andphysical properties were selected as test compounds to be spiked in afield test executed at a hazardous waste incinerator. After collectionof the samples in the field, train components were extracted with methylenechloride, the extracts concentrated, and compounds of interest were quantifiedusing high resolution gas chromatography coupled with low resolutionmass spectrometry. The first field test showed that method precisionand bias are compound specific, and the distribution and recovery ofPOHCs in the various components of the sampling train are related tothe compound chemical functionality, water solubility, and boiling point.</TEXT></DOC>
