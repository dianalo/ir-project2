(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorneys for two leading defensecontractors battling over a canceled, top-secret Navy contractsquared off Tuesday in state court, where they told a judge thatmillions of dollars, hundreds of jobs and national security were atstake.   Norden Systems Inc., a Norwalk-based subsidiary of UnitedTechnologies Corp., is seeking unspecified damages in excess of$15,000 in its lawsuit against General Dynamics Corp. of St. Louis.   Norden filed the breach of contract lawsuit in Stamford SuperiorCourt in June after General Dynamics dropped it from a program todevelop the Advanced Tactical Aircraft, the next generation of Navyjet fighters.   General Dynamics is the prime contractor in the $4 billionproject. It had awarded Norden a $114 million subcontract inJanuary 1988 to develop an in-air radar system for the new fighterjet.   An attorney for General Dynamics argued Tuesday that the lawsuitshould be dismissed because it involves top-secret information andthreatens national security. But following two hours of arguments,Judge Nicholas A. Cioffi recessed the hearing without issuing aruling.   Cioffi said later in his chambers that he needs to research thecase before issuing a written decision. He was unable to say howlong the research might take.   Herbert L. Fenster, a Washington attorney representing GeneralDynamics, said Norden was dropped from the so-called A-12 projectbecause it was ``failing to make progress'' in developing the radarsystem. He said he couldn't prove the claim in court because theNavy has refused to release necessary documents.   ``Very little about this contract can be described to the courtsince those matters are classified,'' Fenster said.   The attorney asked Cioffi to dismiss the lawsuit because itthreatens national security. He explained that General Dynamics candefend itself only by breaking the law and releasing top-secretdocuments.   Cioffi, however, questioned that argument. He said a court casecan be dismissed on national security grounds only at the requestof the federal government, not one of its contractors.   ``If the government is so concerned, why aren't they here?''Cioffi asked. Fenster said the Navy hadn't formally soughtdismissal of the case because it doesn't like to take sides indisputes between contractors. But Norden attorney Peter B. Work ofWashington said the Navy hadn't intervened because it expected thelawsuit to go forward.   ``Norden can, and Norden will prove all the claims ... withoutclassified information,'' Work said.   He said that when the contract was canceled in April, Norden haddone $50 million worth of work on the radar system, but GeneralDynamics had reimbursed it for only $11 million.   Work said the loss of the contract also forced Norden to dismisshundreds of engineers and other workers.</TEXT></DOC>
