It also providedexpress authority for the OCC to issue regulations implementing that statute.Rules concerning the combination of loans to separate borrowers were eliminatedfrom the statute to permit the OCC maximum flexibility in developing regulationson this subject. The OCC implemented the amended statute with a final rule published onApril 12, 1983, 48 FR 15844. This final rule created a new part 32 in title12 of the Code of Federal Regulations which supplanted and restructuredexisting interpretive rulings previously found at 12 CFR part 7. Many ofthe previous interpretive rulings and staff letter opinions construingthose rulings were incorporated into the new regulation to facilitate referenceto the law governing national banks' lending limit. The preamble to thefinal rule requested additional comments on 12 CFR 32.5, resulting in afinal amendment of that section on June 14, 1983, 48 FR 27224. Part 32 has now been in effect for more than six years. The OCC has reviewedthe operation of the regulation and is proposing revisions to simplifyand clarify the regulation. These changes include amendments to definitions,changes in references, and clarification of certain interpretations.Additionally, to enhance ease of use, it is proposed that virtually allsignificant definitions be placed in the beginning of the regulation. TheOCC is also proposing a restructuring and simplification of the loan combinationrules, to clarify their operation and to ground them more solidly on thepolicies underlying the lending limit. Finally, a new, simpler test consistingof an aggregate lending cap of 50 percent of capital is also being proposedto take the place of the ``means and purpose'' test for combining loansto foreign governments, which will also reduce paperwork burdens. The followingis a discussion of the specific changes proposed. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Definitions </ITAG>A. General Definitions In order to make it easier to use the regulation, the OCC proposes to movemost of the relevant definitions to two sections (proposed andSection;andSection;32.2 and 32.3) which will appear in the beginning of the regulation. Manyof these definitions are currently in various interpretive rulings locatedat the end of part 32. Most have been incorporated without change. The following table summarizes the source of each general definition inproposed andSection; 32.2 and whether it has been changed:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s50,r25,r25</C>  <H1>Definition </H1><H1>Source </H1><H1>Comments</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.2(a) ``Person''<D>andSection; 32.2(b) </D><D>No change. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.2(b) ``Capital and Surplus'' <D>andSection; 32.2(c) </D><D>Technical change. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.2(c) ``Standby Letter of Credit'' <D>andSection; 32.2(e) </D><D>No change. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.2(d) ``Named Borrower'' <D>New paragraph </D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.2(e) ``Control'' <D>andSection; 32.5(a) </D><D>Slightly modified.</D></ITAG></ITAG> Most of the definitions in proposed andSection; 32.2 have been incorporatedfrom definitions in the existing regulation. Additionally, a few technicalamendments have been made. For example, the definition of ``unimpairedcapital and unimpaired surplus'' has been amended to reference andSection;3.100, the regulatory section which has replaced former andSection; 7.1100that is referred to in the existing andSection; 32.2(c). Similarly, the definitionof ``control'' in proposed andSection; 32.2(e) has been taken from andSection;32.5(a)(2)(v), but has been slightly modified to make it virtually identicalto the definition of control in 12 U.S.C. 371c. Finally, ``Named Borrower''is defined to refer to the person named as the borrower or debtor in aloan agreement, whether written or oral, express or implied. B. Definition of ``Loan and Extension of Credit'' Additionally, the OCC believes that it will be helpful to locate all thedefinitions of those arrangements considered ``loans and extensions ofcredit'' subject to the lending limit in one section of the regulation.Accordingly, a new andSection; 32.3 is proposed which contains the relevantdefinitions of that key phrase. The section opens with a general definitionof the phrase which has been incorporated without change from the existing12 CFR 32.2(a). Most of the remaining definitions are derived from interpretiverulings currently found immediately after the regulation in part 32. Thesingle new section defining loan renewals merely codifies existing OCCpolicy. It is emphasized that the specific definitions incorporated intothe body of the proposed regulation are <T3>not</T3> the exclusive universe of arrangements which are ``loans.''Rather, the OCC expressly reserves the authority to deem other arrangementsto be ``loans and extensions of credit'' under the general definition ofproposed andSection; 32.3(a). The chart below summarizes the source of each definition in proposed andSection;32.3 and whether it has been changed:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s100,r50,r50</C>  <H1>Definition </H1><H1>Source </H1><H1>Comment</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.3(a) Loan and extension of credit <D>andSection; 32.2(a) </D><D>No change. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.3(b) Contractual commitment to advance funds <D>andSection; 32.2(d) </D><D>Modified. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.3(c) Obligations of other parties <D>andSection; 32.101 </D><D>Modified. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.3(d) Sale of Federal funds <D>andSection; 32.102 </D><D>No change. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.3(e) Purchase of securities subject to repurchase agreement<D>andSection; 32.103 </D><D>Modified. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.3(f) Purchase of third party paper <D>andSection; 32.104 </D><D>No change. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.3(g) Overdrafts <D>andSection; 32.105 </D><D>No change. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.3(h) Charged-off loans <D>andSection; 32.106 </D><D>Modified. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.3(i) Loan renewals <D>New paragraph </D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.3(j) Loan participations <D>andSection; 32.107 </D><D>Modified. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.3(k) General obligations of States <D>andSection; 32.109 </D><D>No change. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 32.3(l) Loans to industrial development authorities <D>andSection; 32.110 </D><D>No change.</D></ITAG></ITAG> Major changes in present definitions are discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. ``Contractual Commitments to Advance Funds'' </ITAG>12 U.S.C. 84(b)(1) defines ``loans and extensions of credit'' to include``any liability of a national banking association to advance funds to oron behalf of a person pursuant to a contractual commitment.'' Likewise,under the present regulation, contractual commitments to advance fundsare considered to be loans for lending limit purposes. 12 CFR 32.2(a).The proposed regulation retains that treatment in andSection; 32.3(b), butwith several important changes. a. <T3>Commercial letters of credit. </T3>The first major change clarifiesthe definition of commercial letters of credit. The phrase ``contractualcommitment to advance funds'' currently includes standby letters of credit.<T3>See </T3>12 CFR 32.2(d) and proposed andSection; 32.3(b). Standby lettersof credit include any letter of credit which represents an obligation tothe beneficiary on the part of the issuer to repay money borrowed by oradvanced to the account party, or to make payment on account of any indebtednessundertaken by the account party, or to make payment on account of any defaultby the account party in the performance of an obligation. <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 32.2(e) and proposed andSection; 32.2(c). However, thephrase ``contractual commitment to advance funds'' does not include commercialletters of credit upon which the issuing bank expects the beneficiary todraw, which do not ``guarantee'' payment of a money obligation, and whichdo not provide for payment in the event of default by the account party.<T3>See </T3>12 CFR 32.2(d). The question has arisen whether so-called ``direct pay'' letters of creditare contractual commitments to advance funds for lending limit purposes.These direct pay letters of credit, like standby letters of credit, aregenerally used to support an account party's obligation to make paymentsto a beneficiary. However, unlike a standby letter of credit, this typeof letter of credit has a ``direct pay'' feature. The direct pay letterof credit serves as a payment mechanism. As explained in OCC InterpretiveLetter No. 361 (May 22, 1986), [1985-1987 Transfer Binder] Fed. BankingL. Rep. (CCH) 85,531, the exemption from the definition of contractualcommitment to advance funds for commercial letters of credit was intendedto apply to the traditional commercial letter of credit used to facilitatethe sale of goods. However, some direct pay letters of credit often involvethe imposition of a payment mechanism on what would otherwise be a standbyletter of credit. The OCC does not believe that this structural alterationshould in and of itself exempt a direct pay letter of credit from the definitionof contractual commitment to advance funds since it does not appear tosignificantly alter the bank's exposure to risk. The OCC is proposing revisionsto the definitions of ``contractual commitments to advance funds'' and``commercial letters of credit'' to clarify this point. Under the proposedandSection; 32.3(b), a letter of credit will be considered a commercial letterof credit and will receive the corresponding exemption from the definitionof contractual commitment to advance funds only if it is expected by theissuer to be drawn upon in connection with a sale or transfer of goods.b. <T3>Commitments to lend.</T3> On June 24, 1988, the OCC adopted a temporaryrule revising its treatment of loan commitments under the lending limitregulation, 53 FR 23752, (hereafter ``Temporary Rule''). This revisionis restated here in proposed andSection; 32.3(b). The Temporary Rule affectedall banks, however, it was intended to provide relief for banks which experienceda decline in their capital and, hence, in their lending limits after enteringinto commitments. Such banks faced the dilemma of either funding thosecommitments, thereby exceeding their lending limit, or breaching the commitmentagreements. Under the Temporary Rule, a binding written commitment within a bank'slending limit when made is treated as a loan from the time the bank enteredinto the commitment. Thus, such a commitment is included within the bank'slending limit until it is released or it expires; a subsequent declinein lending limit does not result in a violation when the commitment isfunded. Loan commitments made in excess of the lending limit are not treatedas ``loans,'' and, thus, are not affected by the revision. Although the Temporary Rule was effective immediately, the OCC requestedcomments from the public. In response to comments objecting to the impactof the Temporary Rule on banks that have not experienced a capital decline,the OCC subsequently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to amend theTemporary Rule. <T3>See</T3> 54 FR 30054 (July 18, 1989). This proposed amendment is intendedto revise and clarify the effect of the Temporary Rule on the loan commitmentsof national banks that have not experienced a decline in capital by restoringsome flexibility to banks in managing their loan commitments relative totheir lending limits. The comment period for the proposed amendment tothe Temporary Rule closed on September 18, 1989. After full considerationof the comments received, the OCC will revise the Temporary Rule priorto adopting a final regulation. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Obligations of Other Parties </ITAG>The lending limit treatment of the obligations of ``accommodation parties''is currently discussed in interpretative ruling 12 CFR 32.101. Numerousquestions have arisen as to the treatment of such parties under the currentrule. Proposed andSection; 32.3(c) incorporates that interpretation withsignificant changes. Under the proposed rule, a loan will be deemed tohave been made to any person (in addition to the named borrower) who becomesa party to the loan agreement or transaction in any capacity that makesthat person primarily liable with the named borrower. A person is a party to the loan transaction, even though not named in theloan agreement, when that person is a party to an ancillary agreement whichis an integral part of the loan transaction. For example, under the proposedrule, a third party who becomes a guarantor of payment through a documentseparate from the loan agreement would still be deemed a ``party to theloan * * * transaction.''A person is ``primarily liable'' when the bank may enforce a right of collectionagainst that person without prior resort against the named borrower, i.e.,without first being required to show that the named borrower has refusedto honor a proper demand for payment. In such a situation, the primaryrepayment obligation of the other party is essentially the same as thenamed borrower's and, thus, a ``loan'' should be deemed to have been madeto that person for purposes of the bank's lending limit. An intention ofthe lending bank to proceed first against one party, rather than anotherwith primary liability, is not material to this issue. On the other hand, one who becomes a party in a capacity that imposes onlysecondary liability, i.e., one who is obligated to pay the debt only afterthere has been unsuccessful resort to the named borrower, has incurreda repayment obligation substantially different from that of the named borrowerand should not be treated as having received a ``loan.'' However, in certaincircumstances, such secondary parties may have a loan attributed to themunder the proposed attribution rules discussed below. <T3>See</T3> proposed andSection; 32.7(c)(iii). One example of such a secondary party is an accommodation endorser whoseobligation is described in sections 3-414 and 3-415 of the Uniform CommercialCode. The proposed regulation also lists a guarantor of collection as anexample of such a secondary party, but distinguishes a guarantor of payment.This distinction is based on section 3-416 of the Uniform Commercial Code.In this regard, it should be noted that under the UCC a guaranty is presumedto be one of payment (primary liability) unless it clearly states thatit is one of collection (secondary liability). Thus, banks are advisedto review their contracts of guaranty to insure that they do not inadvertentlygive rise to such ``loans'' to guarantors. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Purchase of Securities Subject to Repurchase </ITAG>Section 32.103 currently provides that the purchase of ``Type I securities''subject to an agreement that the security will be repurchased at the endof a stated period is not a ``loan and extension of credit'' for lendinglimit purposes. ``Type I securities'' are defined to include general obligationsof the United States or any State or political subdivision thereof. <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 1.3(c). Purchases of other types of securities subjectto an agreement that the seller will repurchase at the end of a statedperiod are considered to be loans for lending limit purposes by the purchasingbank to the seller and not an obligation of the underlying obligor of thesecurity. This exemption is continued in proposed andSection; 32.3(e), buthas been modified as described below. The exemption from the lending limit for purchases of Type I securitiessubject to a repurchase agreement is intended to facilitate the liquidityof Type I securities. The exemption is also justified by the financialintegrity that is normally represented by Type I obligations. However,the dislocations in the securities markets caused by the failure of governmentsecurities dealers have made it apparent that there is additional riskpresent where the bank does not assure control of or establish an effectivesecurity interest in the collateral securities. The failure of the purchasingbank to assure control of or establish its rights to the securities whichunderlie the repurchase transaction introduces all the risks present inan unsecured loan. When control of the collateral securities is not assured,the financial integrity of the collateral security is of little relevanceif the repurchasing counter party fails to honor its commitment. Thus,one of the underlying justifications for the exemption in andSection; 32.103is defeated where the purchasing bank does not obtain sufficient controlof the collateral securities. For the above reasons, the OCC believes that it is appropriate to requirethat the purchasing bank must assure control of or establish its rightsto the collateral securities purchased under the resale agreement in orderto qualify for the exemption. The acceptable methods for obtaining controlof or the right to the collateral securities are specified in proposedandSection; 32.3(e). Essentially, the bank should be able to readily exercisedominion over the property and, thereby, easily establish superior rightsto it. In other words, the bank should be able to have the property quicklydisposed of at market value in order to effect satisfaction of the counterparty's obligation. A bank's purchase of Type I securities subject to arepurchase agreement will be considered a loan and extension of creditthat is subject to the lending limit if the requisite control of or rightto the collateral securities is not obtained. It should be noted that theterm ``physical securities'' is assumed to be one of common parlance inthe securities markets that refers to paper-based or certificated bearerand definitive (registered) securities. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Charged-Off Loans </ITAG>Proposed andSection; 32.3(h) incorporates the interpretation currently in12 CFR 32.106. Section 32.106 generally provides that charged-off loansare subject to a bank's lending limit as loans and extensions of credit.Some bankers have misconstrued this provision to allow additional extensionsof credit to borrowers whom the bank has voluntarily released from charged-offloans even when the total borrowings, including the charged-off loans,exceed the bank's lending limit. The OCC proposes to amend the provisionin andSection; 32.106 to clarify that a written release by the bank of theborrower's obligation will not result in the exemption of a charged-offloan from application of the lending limit. The preamble to the currentregulation, 48 FR 15851 (April 12, 1983), explained that andSection; 32.106was only intended to expand the previous interpretive rule to allow a limitedexemption for charged-off loans which are unenforceable due to the expirationof the statute of limitations, judicial decision or other similar reasons.The proposed amendment clarifies that a mere release of the borrower fromthe obligation to repay will not result in an exemption, and that the charged-offloan will continue to be considered a loan and extension of credit to thedefaulting borrower for purposes of applying the lending limit.The OCC is clarifying its position for prudential reasons. It hopes toencourage banks to seek recoveries on charged-off loans and avoid makingnew credit available to borrowers who have a demonstrated lack of creditworthiness.This clarifying amendment does not affect the availability of the temporarysubstitute lending limit located at andSection; 32.8, 51 FR 15303 (April23, 1986). <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Loan Renewals </ITAG>The proposed rule contains a new definition regarding lending limit treatmentof certain renewals and restructurings of loans. This definition codifiesin Part 32 a longstanding OCC interpretation based on case law. <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, OCC Interpretive Letter No. 286 (April 23, 1984), [TransferBinder 1983-1984] Fed. Banking L. Rep. (CCH) 85,450. <T3>See also Corsicana National Bank </T3>v. <T3>Johnson, </T3>251 U.S. 68 (1919); <T3>Payne </T3>v. <T3>Ostrus, </T3>50 F.2d 1039 (8th Cir. 1931). In general, a renewal orrestructuring of a loan is not regarded as the equivalent of a new loanat the time of renewal for purposes of the lending limit unless new fundsare advanced by the bank to the borrower or a new borrower is substitutedfor the original obligor. The restructuring of a loan to include extendedrepayment terms, altered interest rates, or additional security similarlywill be treated as a renewal rather than a new loan and extension of credit,as long as the original obligor on the loan is not released. Nevertheless, a renewal taken under circumstances which indicate ``a deliberatepurpose to evade the law and to extend unwarranted lines of credit'' wouldviolate the statute. <T3>Payne </T3>v. <T3>Ostrus, </T3>50 F.2d at 1041. Generally, the renewal of a loan is deemedto be an extension of the old debt, applying the lending limit on the daythe bank initially extended the funds. Subsequent events such as a reductionin a bank's capital resulting in a lower lending limit do not cause a loanthat was previously legal to become illegal; rather, such a loan is deemedto be ``nonconforming.'' However, it is the OCC's opinion that renewalsof nonconforming loans present an opportunity to bring loans into conformance.A bank must make every effort to bring a loan into conformance with thebank's lending limit, for example, by having the debtor partially repaythe loan or by securing another bank's participation in the loan. Whereit is not practicable for the bank to make a loan conform to the lendinglimit before the loan is renewed, the OCC will not consider the loan renewalto be a violation of law leading to possible director liability. Notwithstanding the above-stated general policy, the renewal of a loanmade prior to the effective date of this part, which became nonconformingsolely because of a change in the lending limit rules applicable at thetime the loan was made, is subject to the limitations on renewal in andSection;32.9(c). <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Loan Participations </ITAG>Section 32.107, formerly Interpretive Ruling 7.1135, provides for the removalof a loan from a bank's lending limit through the <T3>bona fide,</T3> non-recourse sale of a participation. Some confusionmay have arisen when former I.R. 7.1135 was consolidated into part 32 anda related or companion rule, I.R. 7.7519, was retained in part 7. The proposedandSection; 32.3(i) will incorporate the existing andSection; 32.107 and, additionally,will incorporate I.R. 7.7519 into the section. The new paragraph merelyreorganizes the rules and does not represent a change in OCC position.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Additional Limitation </ITAG>Section 32.4 of the current regulation implements 12 U.S.C. 84(a)(2), whichprovides a separate and additional limitation of 10 percent of unimpairedcapital and unimpaired surplus for loans ``fully secured'' by readily marketablecollateral. Where credit is to be extended and the total exceeds the basic15 percent limit of section 84(a)(1), many bankers have inquired whetherthe entire loan must be fully secured or broken down into two loans, anunsecured loan up to 15 percent of total capital and a fully secured loanup to an additional 10 percent of total capital, to comply with existingandSection; 32.4. The OCC believes that such legal precautions are time-consuming,unnecessary and burdensome for banks to explain to their customers. Accordingly,proposed andSection; 32.5(b) clearly eliminates any requirement for makingtwo separate loans and clarifies that only the portion of a loan that exceedsthe 15 percent limit need be secured. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Rules Governing the Combination of Loans to Separate Borrowers</ITAG>A. Summary of Current Rule and Need For Change The current combination rules can be summarized as follows. The generalrule found in andSection; 32.5(a)(1) is that loans and extensions of creditto one person will be attributed to other persons for lending limit purposeswhen (i) the proceeds of the loans and extensions of credit are to be usedfor the direct benefit of the other person or persons or (ii) a ``commonenterprise'' is deemed to exist between the persons. The regulation containsa general principle and several <T3>per se</T3> rules which are used to determine whether a common enterpriseexists between separate borrowers. The generally applicable principle,set forth at andSection; 32.5(a)(2)(i), is that the evaluation of whethera common enterprise exists will depend upon the facts and circumstancesof individual cases. Loans to separate borrowers may be combined even incases which do not meet every detail of the <T3>per se</T3> rules contained in the regulation. The first <T3>per se</T3> rule, located at andSection; 32.5(a)(2)(ii), provides thata common enterprise will be deemed to exist and loans and extensions ofcredit combined where the expected source of repayment for each loan andextension of credit is the same for each borrower. The second <T3>per se</T3> rule, located at andSection; 32.5(a)(2)(iii), concerns loansand extensions of credit made to borrowers who are related through commoncontrol, as defined in andSection; 32.5(a)(2)(v). The rule provides that,in such circumstances, a common enterprise will be found to exist if thepersons are engaged in interdependent businesses or there is substantialfinancial interdependence among them. A common enterprise will be deemedto exist <T3>per se</T3> when 50 percent or more of one person's annual gross receiptsor expenditures are derived from transactions with one or more personsrelated through common control. (This rule is referred to as the ``50 percenttest.'') The third <T3>per se</T3> rule, located at andSection; 32.5(a)(2)(iv), provides thata common enterprise will be deemed to exist when separate persons borrowfrom a bank for the purpose of acquiring a business enterprise of whichthose persons will own more than 50 percent of the voting securities. The current regulation also contains specific rules concerning loans tocorporate groups at andSection; 32.5(b). These rules provide that loans andextensions of credit to a person (defined at andSection; 32.2(b) to includea corporation) and its subsidiaries need not be combined where the bankhas determined that the person and its subsidiaries are not engaged ina common enterprise, as defined above. Notwithstanding this general rule,the regulation provides at andSection; 32.5(b)(3) that loans and extensionsof credit in the aggregate by a national bank to a corporate group (i.e.,a person and all of its subsidiaries) may not exceed 50 percent of thebank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. The regulation also containsspecific rules governing loans to partnerships at andSection; 32.5(c). The existing rule concerning loans to foreign governments, their agencies,and instrumentalities is located at andSection; 32.5(d). That provision statesthat loans and extensions of credit to foreign governments, their agencies,and instrumentalities will be combined with one another for lending limitpurposes if, at the time the loan and extension of credit is made, theborrower does not have sufficient resources or revenue over time to serviceits debt obligations (``means test'') or the purpose of the loan and extensionof credit is not consistent with the purposes of the borrower's generalbusiness (``purpose test''). Banks are required to assemble and retaincertain documentation concerning such loans to demonstrate compliance withthe means and purpose test(s). As explained in the preamble to the current rule, 48 FR 15846 (April 12,1983), the rules for combining loans to separate but related borrowersare an important aspect of the OCC's bank supervision function. Historically,there has been a correlation between problem banks and concentrations ofloans to related entities. The current combination rules were intendedto serve the OCC's regulatory goal of preventing excessive concentrationsof loans to related borrowers while still accommodating the needs of prudentlenders who might be unnecessarily constrained by overly harsh rules. TheOCC intended that the rules be easily understood and applied. Unfortunately,the combination rules are complex and have caused confusion and uncertainty.Accordingly, the OCC is proposing changes in those rules designed to promotegreater simplicity and certainty.One major source of confusion is that the existing rule is not clearlygrounded in the policies underlying the lending limit statute. Ambiguityin a complex rule is inevitable. However, such ambiguities are much moreeasily resolved if the rule clearly reflects the policies the rule is intendedto promote. Accordingly, the proposed rules are intended to more clearlyreflect the core policy of the lending limit: risk diversification in bankloan portfolios. An additional source of confusion in the present regulation has been theuse of the word ``combine.'' Confusion arises because the term does notclearly indicate the precise nature of the combination or attribution intended.When it is said that loans to A and B will be ``combined,'' we could reallybe saying four different things: andbullet; Loans made to A will be attributed to B, but loans to B will notbe attributed to A. andbullet; Loans to B will be attributed to A, but loans to A will not beattributed to B. andbullet; Loans to A will be attributed to B, and loans to B will be attributedto A. andbullet; Loans to A and B will be attributed to some third party and, thus,combined. To help reduce the confusion which arises from the inherent ambiguity inthe term ``combine,'' the new rules avoid that term and use the more precisewords ``aggregate'' and ``attribute.'' Consistent with this approach, theproposed rules have both an aggregation rule (which specifies which loanswill be added together to determine a bank's lending limit for a particularperson) and attribution rules (which specify when loans nominally madeto one person will be attributed to another for purposes of the bank'slending limit). B. Aggregation Rule As stated above, the aggregation rule in proposed andSection; 32.6 liststhe loans which must be added up in computing the lending limit for a person.Basically, it requires the aggregation of all loans made directly or indirectlyto the person and all loans attributed to the person under the attributionrules described below. The requirement that ``indirect'' loans be aggregatedis based on 12 U.S.C. 84(b)(1) which states that the term ``loans'' shallinclude all ``indirect advances of funds to a person made on the basisof any obligation of that person to repay * * *.'' The OCC has construedthis requirement as relating to situations in which a bank advances fundsto a third party on behalf of or at the direction of a person and is basedon an obligation of that person to repay the funds. C. Attribution Rules Under 12 U.S.C. 84(d)(2), the OCC is granted authority ``to determine whena loan putatively made to a person shall for purposes of [the lending limit]be attributed to another person.'' The attribution rules in proposed andSection;32.7, described below, are an exercise of this authority. Essentially,they are designed so that attribution will occur where needed to servethe purposes of the lending limit, i.e., to promote risk diversification.In this regard, the rule specifically states that attribution of a loanto someone other than the named borrower will not remove the loan fromthe total of loans used to compute the lending limit of the borrower. Becausethe named borrower remains primarily liable on the loan, the bank continuesto have a credit-risk exposure to the named borrower. Thus, an attributedloan should remain and, under the proposed rule, does remain in the namedborrower's total of loans even though it has been attributed to anotherperson and is also included in that person's loan total. As stated above, one goal of the proposed amendment is to clarify the existingrules by grounding them more clearly on the underlying policies of thelending limit. To that end, the OCC is considering two different attributionrules: diversification rules and benefit rules. Each will be discussedbelow.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Diversification Rules </ITAG>To replace the ``common enterprise'' test of the existing regulation, theOCC is proposing attribution rules which clearly promote diversificationof credit risk. These attribution rules consist of a general rule and severalspecific rules. a. <T3>General diversification rule.</T3> The general rule in proposed andSection;32.7(c)(1) states the core principle which will guide attribution underthe diversification rules. The specific diversification rules define situationsin which attribution will usually be warranted under that general principle.It should be noted that the OCC reserves the ability to attribute loansunder the general rule even when none of the specific rules is directlyapplicable. Nevertheless, it is expected that such circumstances will berare and banks should seldom need to seek guidance as to whether attributionis required under the general rule. The proposed general rule states that attribution will be warranted whenthe repayment of a loan will likely depend, directly or indirectly, uponanother person. This principle is in full accord with the risk diversificationpolicy of the statute; in calculating a person's lending limit to promoterisk diversification, a bank should take into account all loans where repaymentis likely to depend upon that person whether or not that person is listedas the named borrower. The phrase ``is likely to depend'' was carefully drafted. The word ``likely''refers to a reasonable likelihood at the time the loan is made that thebank will need to look to someone other than the named borrower for repayment;attribution is warranted even where there is less than a certainty thatsuch recourse will be necessary. b. <T3>Specific diversification rules.</T3> The specific rules described belowdefine situations in which the repayment of a loan is sufficiently dependenton another person to warrant attribution to that person. The intent isto provide rules which are bright-line, relatively easy to apply and basedon information banks normally review in connection with making an informedjudgment as to creditworthiness. One problem with bright-line rules isthat they can be inflexible and, occasionally, over-inclusive, i.e., requireattribution even where the purpose of the statute would not be served.To provide more flexibility, some of the specific rules are phrased asrebuttable presumptions. In other words, they provide that once the bright-linerule is satisfied, attribution will be presumed unless the bank placesinformation in the loan file which specifically and reasonably rebuts thefactual basis for the presumption of attribution. The particular presumptionsand the type of information needed to rebut them will be discussed below.However, two general points on rebuttal need to be emphasized. First, to rebut effectively a presumption under the proposed rule, informationmust be placed in the loan file before the bank becomes legally bound underthe agreement. When a loan is originated, the bank has the responsibilityto determine whether the loan should be attributed to another person and,thereby, cause the bank to exceed its lending limit to that person. Thus,if a bank is going to rely upon the rebuttal of a presumption of attributionto avoid a violation of the lending limit, the information that forms thebasis for the rebuttal must be available and recorded by the bank at thetime the loan is made and its legality is determined. Further, when a bankmakes a loan to a person to whom other existing loans have been attributed,the bank is required to include those attributed loans in the person'stotal when determining whether the new loan would cause the bank to exceedits lending limit. In such a case, if a bank is relying upon a previousrebuttal of a presumption of attribution to exclude such preexisting loansfrom the prospective borrower's total, i.e., loans that would be attributedto the person absent rebuttal, the bank should review the previous rebuttalinformation to confirm that it is still valid. This is consistent withthe established position of the OCC that when a bank makes a new loan,it is responsible for reviewing prior loans to ensure that interveningchanges in circumstances do not require the attribution to the proposednew borrower of prior loans not previously attributed to that person. The second major point on rebuttals is that both the burden of productionand the burden of persuasion with respect to rebuttal lies with the bankthat would rely upon it. The burden of production is the responsibilityfor being able to establish to OCC that the factual basis for the rebuttalwas in existence at the time the loan was made. In this regard, the proposedrule requires that the information be placed in the relevant loan fileat that time. <T3>See</T3> proposed andSection;andSection; 32.7(c)(2) (ii) and (iii). Thus,it is recommended that banks planning to rely on a rebuttal prepare andplace in the loan file a dated and signed memorandum summarizing the factualbasis for the rebuttal and the reasons the author believes those factsto be true. Similarly, the burden of persuasion requires that banks relyingon a rebuttal be able to show to the OCC that the facts relied upon dospecifically and reasonably rebut the basis for the presumption of attributionin the relevant specific rule. In short, a bank is required to demonstrateto the satisfaction of the OCC that a particular loan is entitled to therebuttal and the OCC will be the final arbiter of this issue.(1) <T3>Primary liability in any capacity.</T3> The first specific rule providesin proposed andSection; 32.7(c)(2)(i) that loans will be attributed to anyperson who is in any capacity primarily liable on the loan with the namedborrower. As discussed above in connection with proposed andSection; 32.3(c)(``Obligations of other parties''), primary liability arises when the bankmay enforce a right of collection against the person without prior resortagainst the named borrower. This rule continues a long-standing position of the OCC evidenced in thepresent combination rules and prior interpretive rulings. It is also acorollary to the rule regarding treatment of other parties to the loanagreement in proposed andSection; 32.3(c). The difference between the tworules is that, unlike proposed andSection; 32.3(c) which applies only toparties to the loan transaction, this specific rule applies to a personwho incurs primary liability on a loan without becoming a party to theloan transaction; but the effect of the two rules is the same. Unlike someof the other specific rules to be discussed, attribution under this ruleis not subject to rebuttal. The proposed rule lists two examples of arrangements which can requireattribution: partnerships and joint ventures or associations. The rulecontinues the treatment of these arrangements under andSection; 32.5(c) ofthe existing rule without significant change. Thus, for example, the OCCwill continue its policy of attributing to general partners loans madeto a partnership notwithstanding non-recourse arrangements in those loans.<T3>See</T3> 48 FR 15844, 15848 (April 12, 1983). Similarly, the OCC willcontinue to exempt limited partners and members of associations or jointventures from attribution if the limited partnership, joint venture, orassociation agreement provides that they are exempt from liability forthe obligations of the entity and if such provisions are valid under applicablestate law. (2) <T3>Source of repayment.</T3> Consistent with the diversification policyof the lending limit, a specific rule has been proposed in andSection; 32.7(c)(2)(ii)to attribute a loan to any person who is expected to be the source of repaymentof the loan. Thus, the OCC is continuing the rule currently found in andSection;32.5(a)(2)(ii), the first <T3>per se</T3> test of ``common enterprise.'' Note that as explained byproposed andSection; 32.7(c)(2)(ii)(A), the effect of having loans to severaldifferent borrowers attributed to the same person as the source of repaymentis to aggregate those loans for lending limit purposes together with allother loans to the repayment source. For example, if a bank has made loansto A, B, and C, and if C is the source of repayment for A and B, then theloans to A and B would be attributed to C and, hence, C's total loans forlending limit purposes would include all three loans. In determining whether a person is a ``source of repayment,'' the OCC willcontinue to be guided by precedent under current andSection; 32.5(a)(2)(ii).However, the proposed rule further provides that a person will be presumedto be the source of repayment for a loan when that person provides morethan 50 percent of the named borrower's annual gross receipts. The definitionof ``annual gross receipts'' has been incorporated from existing andSection;32.5(a)(2)(iii). In determining a borrower's annual gross receipts, a bankmay use factual information for the 12 months immediately preceding theloan, factual information for the latest fiscal period, or informationfor the 12 months covered by the borrower's most recent audited financialstatements provided they are reasonably current. The presumption that a person is a source of repayment under the 50 percenttest may be rebutted. As an example, assume that a partner in a professionalpartnership receives more than 50 percent of his or her annual gross receiptsin the form of distributions from the partnership and, thus, the partnershipis presumed to be the source of repayment for a loan to the partner. Sucha loan would not be required to be attributed to the partnership if thepresumption were rebutted by showing that the partnership is merely actingas a conduit for the individual partner's billings of his or her own clients.As another example, rebuttal could be based on a showing that while a borrowerhad been dependent on a particular company for more than 50 percent ofhis gross receipts over the past year, his income source had recently changed.In such a situation, of course, the loan should be attributed to the newincome source if it exceeds the 50 percent test. The OCC does not propose to accept the fact that the borrower has sufficientfunds from other sources to repay a specific loan as a basis for rebuttal.In other words, where a borrower derives more than 50 percent of its incomefrom a particular source, the loan will be attributed to that source evenif it is shown that the remaining income from other sources is adequateto repay a specific debt. The OCC requests specific comment on the needto maintain this position as a means to further the risk diversificationpolicy of the lending limit. In proposed andSection; 32.7(c)(2)(ii)(C), a major exception to the proposed``source of repayment'' rule is provided to prevent employers from havingemployee loans attributed to them. Specifically, an individual's employerwill not be treated as a source of repayment under this rule because ofwages and salaries paid to that individual unless such individual controlsthe person paying the wage or salary. The relevant definition of ``control''is contained in proposed andSection; 32.2(e).(3) <T3>Common security or enhancements.</T3> A specific rule in proposed andSection;32.7(c)(2)(iii) addresses attribution due to reliance upon collateral orcredit enhancements. Basically, the proposed rule provides that a loansecured by an interest in or commitment by a person, business or propertywill be presumptively attributed to that person, business or property ifthe named borrower lacks adequate revenue or resources, when the loan ismade, to repay the debt in accord with the terms of the loan agreement.Under such circumstances, repayment of the loan will be presumed to dependprimarily on the securing interest or commitment and, thus, the diversificationpolicy of the lending limit requires that the loan be attributed to thatexpected repayment source. However, as will be discussed, this presumptionis subject to rebuttal. This proposed special rule addresses concentrations of credit risk thatcan arise from excessive reliance upon the same collateral or source ofcredit enhancement. The rule provides that where a loan is attributed toa property or business that is not a ``person'' under the rule, the lendinglimit will still be applied as if that business or property was a person,i.e., the loans attributed to it will be aggregated to determine whetherthey exceed the bank's lending limit. The treatment of credit enhancement parties under proposed andSection; 32.7(c)(2)(iii)is consistent with the proposed andSection; 32.3(c) which provides that usuallyparties to a loan transaction which incur only secondary liability willnot be treated as having received a loan and extension of credit. Guarantorsof collection and accommodation endorsers are examples of such secondarycredit enhancement parties. However, under the proposed rule, such partiesmay have a loan attributed to them if, at the time the loan is made, thereis a sufficient likelihood that they will be called upon to repay the loan.The determination of whether the named borrower has sufficient revenueor resources to service the debt at the time the loan is made will be relativelystraightforward based on generally accepted credit underwriting standards.Assuming that such revenue or resources are lacking when the loan is made,the presumption of attribution can still be rebutted by information showinga reasonable basis to expect that the borrower will in the near futuredevelop such resources or revenue. For example, assume that a parent signsas the guarantor of collection on a car loan to a child who recently graduatedfrom college. The child is unemployed at the time the loan is made and,thus, is unable to service the loan when it is made. The presumption attributingthe loan to the guarantor parent could be rebutted by information indicatingthat the child had accepted an offer of employment to begin in the relativelynear future and that the salary from that new job will be sufficient toservice the debt. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Benefit Rules </ITAG>The OCC is strongly considering eliminating the ``direct benefit'' testof the existing andSection; 32.5(a)(i). However, to facilitate comment onwhether such a test should be retained, general and specific benefit-basedattribution rules are provided in proposed andSection; 32.7(d). If OCC decidesnot to retain a benefit-based rule, proposed andSection; 32.7(d) will notappear in the final rule. The OCC specifically requests comment on whether a benefit-based test forattribution should be retained. The OCC is particularly interested in commentson the following points: andbullet; Does the benefit-based rule significantly advance the purposesof the lending limit statute? andbullet; Is a benefit-based rule necessary to accomplish the supervisoryobjectives of the OCC or will the proposed diversification rules suffice?andbullet; What are the costs to the industry and the OCC of retaining abenefit-based rule? a. <T3>General benefit rule.</T3> The general benefit rule in proposed andSection;32.7(d)(1) essentially incorporates the language of existing andSection;32.5(a)(1)(i). The proposed specific rules define circumstances in whichloan proceeds will be deemed to directly benefit another person and, thus,require attribution to that person under the general rule. The specificrules in proposed andSection; 32.7(d)(2) reflect interpretations of existingandSection; 32.5(a)(1)(i) that the OCC has adopted, but they are not intendedto be an exclusive listing of direct benefit situations; the OCC reservesthe ability to attribute loans under the general rule even when none ofthe specific rules are applicable. b. <T3>Specific benefit rules.</T3> The first specific rule in proposed andSection;32.7(d)(2)(i) provides that where the proceeds of a loan are loaned toanother party, the loan will be attributed to that other party. Similarly,the rule provides for attribution when the proceeds are transferred withouta reasonably equivalent exchange of value, i.e., where the recipient ofthe proceeds has not exchanged property or services the fair market valueof which approximate the amount of proceeds received. The exchange of therecipient's note for the loan proceeds will not be an exchange of value,but rather a loan. The second specific rule in proposed andSection; 32.7(d)(2)(ii) covers situationssimilar to the first except that it applies where property purchased withthe proceeds of the loan, rather than the proceeds themselves, is transferredwithout an equivalent exchange of value. The third specific rule in proposed andSection; 32.7(d)(2)(iii) covers loansto trusts. Essentially it provides that loans to trusts will be attributedto the beneficiaries of the trust according to their degree of beneficialownership or entitlement. Thus, for example, where a loan to a trust wasused to purchase property which would benefit both the income beneficiaryand the corpus beneficiary, the loan would be attributed to both <T3>pro rata.</T3> The final specific rule in proposed andSection; 32.7(d)(2)(iv) provides thatwhere the proceeds of a loan are used to purchase the original-issue equityof another person so that the proceeds are received as part of the capitalof that person, the loan will be attributed to that other person. Accordingly,under this rule, loans used to purchase previously issued shares from anexisting shareholder would not be attributed to the issuing corporation.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Loans to Corporations </ITAG>The rule in proposed andSection; 32.7(e) continues the existing rule withrespect to loans to corporations with one minor change; it eliminates surplusagein current andSection; 32.5(b)(2). Section 32.5(b)(2), pertaining to loans to corporations, reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Loans or extensions of credit to a person and its subsidiary or tosubsidiaries of one person need not be combined where the bank has determinedthat the person and subsidiaries involved are not engaged in a ``commonenterprise'' as the term is defined in paragraph (a) of this section.</ITAG>This provision was intended to emphasize that a bank would not have toautomatically combine all loans and extensions of credit to a person andits subsidiaries. The paragraph does not state a rule but is primarilyeditorial; it reiterates a rule previously set forth in existing andSection;32.5(a) and is unnecessary. Some banks, however, have placed undue emphasison the phrase ``where the bank has determined'' that no common enterpriseexists and have argued that the OCC was thereby acknowledging that onlythe banks, and not the OCC, should make the determination whether suchloans should be combined. This is neither Congress's nor the OCC's intentionand, accordingly, it is proposed that the paragraph be removed. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Proposed Elimination of Means and Purpose Test </ITAG>The OCC is proposing to revise the rules concerning national banks' lendingto foreign governments, their agencies and their instrumentalities. Specifically,the OCC is proposing to eliminate the means and purpose test and the associatedcollection-of-information requirements. The means and purpose test essentiallyinvolves a series of determinations made by bank management of a highlysubjective nature. The OCC believes that it is possible to establish moredefinitive ground rules in proposed andSection; 32.7(f) that will add neededcertainty to the area of loans to foreign governments and their agenciesand instrumentalities and will adequately protect banks against excessiveconcentration in such loans. The proposed change is intended neither toloosen nor tighten the limit on loans to foreign governments. Rather, theproposed rule is intended to ease compliance burdens and to accord loansto foreign governments treatment similar to that of private borrowers.Comments are specifically requested on the effect of the proposed rulein these respects. The OCC's proposal contains an aggregate limit on a national bank's loansto a foreign government and its agencies (including political subdivisions)and instrumentalities of 50 percent of the bank's unimpaired capital andunimpaired surplus. The term ``political subdivision'' includes the foreignequivalent of state and local governments. Comment is specifically requestedas to whether a political subdivision with independent taxing authorityshould be entitled to its own 15 percent limit, upon adequate documentationby the lender. The term ``instrumentalities'' of a foreign government refersto corporations or other business organizations that are, directly or indirectly,majority-owned or controlled by the foreign government. The presumptionof control applied here to foreign governments is similar to that usedin existing andSection; 32.5(a)(2)(v). More generally, the 50 percent foreigngovernment lending cap is modeled on the 50 percent corporate group lendingcap in existing andSection; 32.5(b). As noted above, the rule imposing the50 percent corporate group lending cap is based on the principle that therisks in lending to one member of a corporate group closely resemble therisks of lending to the entire group. <T3>See</T3> 48 FR 15848 (April 12, 1983). The OCC holds a similar beliefconcerning the risks of lending to government entities or government-ownedcorporations within a single country. Thus, the OCC believes that the 50percent foreign government lending cap is appropriate. Within the 50 percent overall cap, a national bank's loans and extensionsof credit to a foreign government and its agencies (including politicalsubdivisions) and instrumentalities that are primarily performing governmentalfunctions will be limited to an individual and aggregate cap of 15 percentof the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. In other words,this proposed rule applies the statutory 15 percent limit to loans to aforeign government and its agencies and instrumentalities that are performinggovernmental functions. This approach is logical because all debts of agovernment and its agencies will be dependent upon one repayment source,i.e., the government's fund-raising ability. Of course, the usual statutoryexceptions will be applicable to such loans. By contrast, each individual instrumentality of a foreign government engagedin commercial activities will have its own separate 15 percent limitation(subject to the usual statutory exemptions). The OCC believes that suchbusinesses should, to the fullest extent possible, be treated like theirU.S. counterparts. A separate 35 percent aggregate limitation within the50 percent foreign government lending cap will be imposed on a nationalbank's loans to all such commercial-activity instrumentalities of a foreigngovernment. This 35 percent aggregate figure is justified by the fact thatsuch entities have a source of revenue separate from that of the foreigngovernment, i.e., funds from their commercial operations.The OCC has proposed to define ``commercial activities'' with referenceto the private sector of the United States economy and the concept of freeenterprise prevalent in the United States. The OCC anticipates that thisterm will be refined through the issuance of interpretive letter opinions.Nevertheless, the OCC specifically requests comment on the types of factorsthat distinguish ``commercial activities'' from ``governmental functions.''<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Transitional Rules </ITAG>The transitional rules currently found in andSection; 32.7 were designedto cover the period after the effective date of the statutory amendment,October 15, 1982, and prior to the effective date of andSection; 32.7, April14, 1983. The statute has now been in effect for seven years and the currentregulation has been in effect for six years. The window period for loansin conformance with the prior statute but not in conformance with part32 ended on January 1, 1985. It appears that the transitional rules areno longer necessary to resolve any problems, inconsistencies or inequitiescaused by the gap in effective dates of the statute and regulation and,accordingly, the OCC proposes to delete them. However, any litigation oradministrative action concerning a violation of 12 U.S.C. 84 during thatperiod should be decided on the basis of the transitional rules. Of course,any violation of 12 U.S.C. 84 which occurred prior to its amendment in1982 will continue to be decided on the basis of the rules in effect atthat time. Transitional rules are, however, needed to cover the amendments proposedin this rulemaking and are provided in the proposed andSection; 32.9. Theyare essentially the same as the existing transitional rules except as discussedbelow. Proposed andSection; 32.9(a) continues the rule of existing andSection; 32.7(a)by providing that loans which were in violation of the lending limit priorto any of the effective dates, including the effective date of the proposedamendments, will remain violations until paid in full. Over-line commitmentsissued prior to the effective date of the Temporary Rule on commitments,June 24, 1988, were not ``loans'' and, thus, are not subject to this transitionalrule. However, the rule would apply to any over-line advances made priorto the effective date of the Temporary Rule. Unfunded commitments are treatedin proposed andSection; 32.9(d), discussed below. Proposed andSection; 32.9(c), like existing andSection; 32.7(c), grandfathersexisting conforming loans and, further, permits renewals and extensionsof such loans even if not in conformance with the new rules. However, suchrenewals or extensions must conform with the new rules no later than twoyears after the new rules become effective. Proposed andSection; 32.9(d) and the Temporary Rule will permit a bank tohonor all legally binding commitments to advance funds which were madein good faith prior to the effective date of the amendment and were withinthe bank's lending limit when made, even if the advances would cause thebank to exceed its present lending limit if they were treated as new loans.Thus, the new treatment of commitments applies retroactively to eligiblecommitments entered into before the effective date of the Temporary Rule,as well as to commitments entered into after that date. However, the newrule does not retroactively validate advances that were made prior to theeffective date of the Temporary Rule and that exceeded the lending limitat that time. Even if made pursuant to a binding commitment, such advanceswere illegal loans when made and will remain violations of law. A rulewhich retroactively validated such advances would impair the existing rightsof shareholders against their directors under 12 U.S.C. 93(a). <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Interpretations </ITAG>As explained above, most of the existing interpretations have been movedinto the body of the proposed regulation. However, the OCC will retainexisting 12 CFR 32.108, as new andSection; 32.101, and existing 12 CFR 32.111,as new andSection; 32.102, without change. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Special Studies </ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Comptrollerof the Currency certifies that this proposed regulation will not have asignificant impact on a substantial number of small banks. All banks shouldbenefit from the regulatory simplification that will result from the proposal.Executive Order 12291 The OCC has determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a ``majorrule'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291. Consequently, a RegulatoryImpact Analysis will not be required on the grounds that this revision(1) would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more,(2) would not result in a major increase in the cost of bank operationsor government supervision, and (3) would not have a significant adverseeffect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or competition with foreign-based entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 32 </ITAG>National banks, Lending limit.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, title 12, chapter I, parts 7and 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations are proposed to be amended asfollows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 7_INTERPRETIVE RULINGS </ITAG>1.

ThisPart does not apply to loans made by a national bank to its affiliates(as that term is defined in subsection (b)(1) of section 23A of the FederalReserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c(b)(1))), operating subsidiaries, and Edge Actor Agreement Corporation subsidiaries. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 32.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>For purposes of this part:(a) <T3>Person</T3> means an individual; sole proprietorship; partnership;joint venture; association; trust; estate; business trust; corporation;not-for-profit corporation; sovereign government or agency, instrumentality,or political subdivision thereof; or any similar entity or organization.<ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T4>Note:</T4> Old andSection; 32.2(b) without change.](b) <T3>Unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus</T3> is equivalent to theterms ``capital'' and ``surplus'' as defined in 12 CFR 3.100.<ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T4>Note:</T4> Old andSection; 32.2(c) with technical change.](c) A <T3>standby letter of credit</T3> is any letter of credit, or similar arrangement,however named or described, which represents an obligation to the beneficiaryon the part of the issuer (1) To repay money borrowed by or advanced to or for the account of theaccount party, or (2) To make payment on account of any indebtedness undertaken by the accountparty, or(3) To make payment on account of any default by the account party in theperformance of an obligation.<ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T4>Note:</T4> Old andSection; 32.2(e) without change.](d) A <T3>named borrower</T3> is the person named as the borrower or debtor inthe loan agreement.<ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T4>Note:</T4> New paragraph.](e) For purposes of andSection; 32.7(a)(2)(ii), a person shall be presumedto have ``control'' when: (1) The person directly or indirectly or acting through one or more otherpersons owns, controls, or has power to vote 25 percent or more of anyclass of voting securities of another person; or (2) The person controls, in any manner, the election of a majority of thedirectors, trustees, or other persons exercising similar functions, ofanother person; or (3) Any other circumstances exist which indicate that the person directlyor indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management orpolicies of another person.<ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T4>Note:</T4> New paragraph.] <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 32.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definition of ``loan and extension of credit.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T4>Note:</T4> New section.] (a) <T3>Loans and extensions of credit</T3> means any direct or indirect advanceof funds (including obligations of makers and endorsers arising from thediscounting of commercial paper) to a person made on the basis of any obligationof that person to repay the funds, or repayable from specific propertypledged by or on behalf of a person. ``Loans and extensions of credit''also includes a ``contractual commitment to advance funds'' as that termis defined in this section.<ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T4>Note:</T4> Old text moved from andSection; 32.2(a) without modification.](b) (1) <T3>Contractual commitment to advance funds</T3> means: (i) A bank's obligation, under a standby letter of credit as defined inandSection; 32.2 or similar arrangement, to make payments (directly or indirectly)to a third party beneficiary contingent upon a default by the bank's customerin the performance of an obligation under the terms of that customer'scontract with the third party or upon some other stated condition, or (ii) A bank's obligation to guarantee or stand as surety for the benefitof a third party. (2) In addition to standby letters of credit, the term includes guarantees,puts or other similar arrangements. Further, a binding, written commitmentto lend is considered a ``contractual commitment to advance funds'' underthis part if it and all other outstanding loans (including other bindingcommitments) to the borrower are within the bank's lending limit on thedate of the commitment. Thus, if such a commitment and all other outstandingloans to a borrower are within the bank's lending limit on the date ofa commitment, the bank may fund the commitment without violating the lendinglimit even if its capital and, hence, its lending limit should declineprior to the actual advance of the funds. On the other hand, if a commitmentand all other outstanding loans to a borrower are not within a bank's lendinglimit on the date of the commitment, then the commitment would not be deemeda loan until funded and its legality would be determined at that time.In determining whether the issuance of a commitment would cause a bankto exceed its lending limit on the date of the commitment, a bank may deductfrom the amount of the commitment the aggregate amount of legally bindingwritten loan participations in the commitment by other financially responsiblepersons or institutions. (3) For purposes of this part, commercial letters of credit are not considered``contractual commitments to advance funds.'' A commercial letter of creditis a letter of credit under which the issuing bank expects the beneficiaryto draw upon the issuer in connection with a sale or transfer of goods.<ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T4>Note:</T4> Text moved from old andSection; 32.2(d) and modified.](c) Obligations of other parties.

Where the seller'sobligation to repurchase is limited, the seller's total loans and extensionsof credit, for the purpose of 12 U.S.C. 84, are measured by the total amountof paper the seller may ultimately be obligated to repurchase. Where nomore than an agreed percentage of the purchase price is retained by thebank and credited to a reserve to be held as a form of collateral security,but the bank has no direct or indirect recourse to the seller, the loansand extensions of credit do not constitute loans and extensions of creditto the seller subject to the limitations of section 84.

In order to remove a loan and extension of credit from abank's lending limit, a participation must result in a pro rata sharingof credit risk proportionate to the respective interests of the originatingand participating lenders. This is so even where the participation agreementprovides that repayment must be applied first to the shares sold. In thatcase, the pro rata sharing may only be accomplished if the agreement alsoprovides that, in case of a default or comparable event defined in theagreement, participants shall share in all subsequent repayments and collectionsin proportion to the percentage of participation at the time of the occurrenceof the event.<ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T4>Note: </T4>Old text moved without change.](2) The provisions of the above paragraph apply to ``loans and extensionsof credit,'' as defined in this section, including ``contractual commitment(s)to advance funds,'' as defined above.

It also contains special rules applicableto loans to foreign governments and loans to corporations. (b) Attribution of a loan to a person other than the named borrower forpurposes of computing a bank's lending limit to that other person can occurunder the two types of rules set forth below: the diversification rulesand the benefit rules. Attribution under the rules below does not removea loan from the named borrower's total of loans used to compute whetherthat total exceeds the bank's lending limit; rather, the loan is includedin determining the total of loans for both the borrower and the attributedperson. (c) <T3>Diversification rules_</T3>(1) <T3>General diversification rule.</T3> A loan made to a named borrowerwill be attributed to another person when the repayment of the loan islikely to depend, directly or indirectly, on that other person. (2) <T3>Specific rules.</T3> The rules below define circumstances in whichthe repayment of a loan to one person may be sufficiently dependent uponanother person to warrant attribution to that other person. However, OCCretains authority to require attribution, under the general rule above,in other situations when warranted by the facts and circumstances. (i) <T3>Primary liability in any capacity.</T3> Loans upon which a person otherthan the named borrower is jointly or severally liable in any capacitywith the named borrower are attributed to that other person. Examples ofthis rule are:(A) Loans to a partnership are attributed to its general partners. However,such loans are not attributed to limited partners in a limited partnershipif under the partnership agreement and applicable state law the limitedpartners are not liable for partnership debts and actions. (B) Loans to a joint venture or association are attributed to each memberunless the members, by the terms of the membership agreement and applicablestate law, are not liable for the debts or actions of the joint ventureor association. (ii) <T3>Source of repayment. </T3>Loans made to a named borrower are attributedto another person which is the source of repayment of the loan. A personwill be presumed to be the source of repayment when that person suppliesmore than 50% of the borrowers annual gross receipts, as defined below,at the time the loan is made. This presumption will be inapplicable if,at the time the loan is made, the loan file contains factual informationwhich specifically and reasonably rebuts the presumption. This rule willbe applied as follows: (A) Loans to different borrowers who share a source of repayment in thesame person will be aggregated through their attribution to the commonrepayment source. Further, loans attributed to a person as a repaymentsource under this rule will be aggregated with all other loans on whichthat person is directly liable or which have been attributed to that personunder this or other rules. (B) For the purposes of this paragraph, ``gross receipts'' includes grossrevenues, intercompany loans, dividends, capital contributions, and similarreceipts. (C) To prevent employers from having employee loans attributed to themunder this rule, an individual's employer will not be a ``source of repayment''under this rule because of wages or salaries paid to that individual unlesssuch individual controls the person paying the wage or salary. (iii) <T3>Common security or enhancements. </T3>Dependence upon security, collateral,or source of credit enhancement will not cause a loan to be attributedto another entity except as provided below. A loan secured by an interestin or commitment by a person, business, or property will be attributedto that person, business, or property if the named borrower lacks adequateresources or revenue, when the loan is made, to repay the debt in accordwith the terms of the loan agreement. Under such circumstances, repaymentof the loan will be presumed to depend primarily on the securing interestor commitment. This presumption will be inapplicable if, at the time aloan is made, the loan file contains factual information which specificallyand reasonably rebuts the presumption. Where a business or property reliedupon by a borrower as a source of credit enhancement is not a ``person''as defined above, the lending limit will be applied as if it were a ``person,''i.e., the loans attributed to the business or property under this rulewill be aggregated to determine whether they exceed the statutory lendinglimit. (d) <T3>Benefit rules</T3>_(1) <T3>General benefit rule. </T3>A loan made to a named borrower will beattributed to another person when the proceeds of the loan are used orare to be used for the direct benefit of the other person. (2) <T3>Specific benefit rules. </T3>The rules below define circumstances inwhich loan proceeds will be deemed to directly benefit another person andrequire attribution of the loan to the other person. However, OCC retainsauthority to require attribution, under the general benefit rule, in othersituations when warranted by the facts and circumstances. (i) Loans the proceeds of which are either transferred to another personwithout a reasonably equivalent exchange of value or are loaned to anotherperson will be attributed to that other person. (ii) Loans the proceeds of which are used to purchase an asset that istransferred to another person without a reasonably equivalent exchangeof value will be attributed to that other person. (iii) Loans to a trust will be attributed to the beneficiary of the trust.Loans to a trust with multiple beneficiaries will be attributed to eachbeneficiary according to the degree of beneficial ownership or entitlementunder the terms of the trust. (iv) Loans the proceeds of which are used to invest in or purchase originalissue equity of another person so that the proceeds are received as partof the capital of that person will be attributed to that other person.(e) <T3>Loans to corporations.</T3> (1) For purposes of this paragraph, a corporationis a ``subsidiary'' of any person which owns or beneficially owns morethan 50 percent of the voting stock of the corporation. Such ownershipneed not be direct. Thus, if A owns more than 50 percent of the votingstock of Corporation X which, in turn, owns more than 50 percent of thevoting stock of Corporation Y, Corporation Y would be considered a subsidiaryboth of A and of Corporation X. (2) Loans and extensions of credit by a national bank to a ``corporategroup'' may not exceed 50 percent of the bank's unimpaired capital andunimpaired surplus. This aggregate limitation applies only to loans madepursuant to sections 84 (a)(1) and (a)(2). A ``corporate group'' includesa person and all of it subsidiaries. (f) <T3>Loans to foreign governments, their agencies, and instrumentalities.</T3>(1) For purposes of this paragraph: (i) <T3>Agencies</T3> of a foreign government means agencies, departments andpolitical subdivisions of the foreign government, including provinces orstates and local or municipal governments. (ii) <T3>Instrumentalities</T3> of a foreign government include corporationsor other business organizations that are, directly or indirectly, majority-ownedor controlled by the foreign government. (iii) <T3>Control</T3> by a foreign government shall be presumed to exist when:(A) The foreign government controls, in any manner, the election of a majorityof the directors, trustees, or other persons exercising similar functionsof another person; or (B) Any other circumstances exist which indicate that the foreign governmentdirectly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the managementor policies of another person. (iv) <T3>Commercial activity</T3> means an activity involving trade, commerceor profit generally conducted or performed in the private sector of theUnited States economy. (v) <T3>Governmental function</T3> means an activity generally performed orengaged in only by a sovereign entity and does not include those activitiesreferred to in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section. (2) Loans and extensions of credit to any single instrumentality of a foreigngovernment which is primarily engaged in commercial activities shall notexceed 15 percent of a bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus;all loans to such instrumentalities of a foreign government shall not exceed,in aggregate, 35 percent of a bank's unimpaired capital and surplus. (3) Loans and extensions of credit to a foreign government and any of itsagencies and instrumentalities thereof that are primarily engaged in theperformance of a governmental function shall not exceed, in the aggregate,15 percent of a bank's unimpaired capital and surplus. (4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, a nationalbank's loans and extensions of credit to a foreign government, its agencies,and instrumentalities may not, when combined, exceed 50 percent of thebank's unimpaired capital and surplus. The 50 percent limitation is thetotal of the following:(i) Loans and extensions of credit to a foreign government and any of itsagencies and instrumentalities thereof that are primarily engaged in theperformance of a governmental function; plus (ii) Loans and extensions of credit to all instrumentalities of a foreigngovernment primarily engaged in commercial activities. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 32.8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exceptions to the lending limit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">[Note: Old andSection; 32.6 without change.]</ITAG>(a) <T3>Discount of commercial or business paper_</T3>(1) <T3>Law. </T3>12 U.S.C. 84(c)(1) provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Loans or extensions of credit arising from the discount of commercialor business paper evidencing an obligation to the person negotiating itwith recourse shall not be subject to any limitation based on capital andsurplus.</ITAG>(2) This exception applies to negotiable paper given in payment of thepurchase price of commodities in domestic or export transactions purchasedfor resale or to be used in connection with the fabrication of a product,or to be used for any other business purpose which may reasonably be expectedto provide funds for payment of the paper. Loans or extensions of creditarising from the discount of paper of the kind described in this paragraphmust bear the full recourse endorsement of the owner. However, loans orextensions of credit arising from the discount of such paper in exporttransactions may be endorsed by such owner without recourse or with limitedrecourse, or may be accompanied by a separate agreement for limited recourse;provided, that if transferred without full recourse, the paper must besupported by an assignment of appropriate insurance covering the political,credit, and transfer risks applicable to the paper. Insurance providedby the Export-Import Bank or the Foreign Credit Insurance Association isconsidered appropriate for this purpose. Loans or extensions of creditbased on this exception are not subject to any limitation. (3) Since the reason for the unlimited credit under this exception is thatthe paper arises from the sale of a commodity which may reasonably be expectedto provide funds for payment of the paper, failure to pay either principalor interest when due removes the reason for unlimited credit. Therefore,although the line of credit to the maker or endorser should not be classifiedas excessive by reason of such default, the paper on which the defaulthas occurred must thereafter be taken into consideration in determiningwhether additional loans or extensions of credit may be made within thelimits of 12 U.S.C. 84. The same principles of disqualification from theexception applies to any renewal or extension of either the entire loanor an installment thereof. (b) <T3>Bankers' acceptances</T3>_(1) <T3>Law. </T3>12 U.S.C. 84(c)(2) provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">The purchase of bankers, acceptances of the kind described in section13 of the Federal Reserve Act and issued by other banks shall not be subjectto any limitation based on capital and surplus.</ITAG>(2) This exception permits the purchase by a national bank without limitationof bankers, acceptances created by other banks, provided that such acceptancesare of the kind described in 12 U.S.C. 372 and 373 (eligible acceptances).Acceptances other than those described in section 372 and 373 must be includedwithin the purchasing bank's lending limit to each acceptor bank. (3) The limits under which a national bank may itself accept drafts eligiblefor rediscount are contained in sections 372 and 373. These limits aredistinct from the limits under section 84. Acceptances by a national bankof ``ineligible'' drafts, i.e., time drafts which do not meet the requirementsfor discount with a Federal Reserve bank, are subject to the limitationsof section 84. (4) During any period within which a national bank holds its own acceptances,eligible or ineligible, having given value therefor, the amount given isconsidered, for purposes of this Part, to be a loan or extension of creditto the customer for whom the acceptance was made and is subject to thelending limits. To the extent that a loan or extension of credit createdby discounting the acceptance is covered by a bona fide participation agreement,the discounting bank need only consider that portion of the discountedacceptance which it retains as being subject to the limitations of Section84. (c) <T3>Loans secured by bills of lading or warehouse receipts covering readilymarketable staples</T3>_(1) <T3>Law. </T3>12 U.S.C. 84(c)(3) provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Loans and extensions of credit secured by bills of lading, warehousereceipts, or similar documents transferring or securing title to readilymarketable staples shall be subject to a limitation of 35 per centum ofcapital and surplus in addition to the general limitations if the marketvalue of the staples securing each additional loan or extension of creditat all times equals or exceeds 115 per centum of the outstanding amountof such loan or extension of credit. The staples shall be fully coveredby insurance whenever it is customary to insure such staples.</ITAG>(2) This exception allows a national bank to make loans or extensions ofcredit to one person in an amount equal to 35 percent of its capital andsurplus in addition to the general 15 percent permitted by section 84(a)(1)and in addition to the 10 percent permitted by section 84(a)(2), providedthe collateral requirements of section 84(a)(2) are met.(3) A readily marketable staple means an article of commerce, agriculture,or industry of such uses as to make it the subject of dealings in a readymarket with sufficiently frequent price quotations as to make: (i) the price easily and definitely ascertainable, and (ii) the staple itself easy to realize upon sale at any time at a pricewhich would not involve any considerable sacrifice from the amount at whichit is valued as collateral. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Staples eligible for this exception must be nonperishable, may berefrigerated or frozen, and must be fully covered by insurance when suchinsurance is customary. This exception is intended to apply primarily tobasic commodities, such as wheat and other grains, cotton, wool, and basicmetals such as tin, copper, lead, and the like. Whether a commodity isreadily marketable depends upon existing conditions and it is possiblethat a commodity that qualifies at one time may cease to qualify at a laterdate. Fabricated commodities which do not constitute standardized interchangeableunits and do not possess uniformly broad marketability do not qualify asreadily marketable collateral. (4) Commodities sometimes fail to qualify as nonperishable because of themanner in which they are handled or stored during the life of the loanor extension of credit. Accordingly, the question as to whether a stapleis nonperishable must be determined on a case-by-case basis. (5) This exception is applicable to a loan or extension of credit arisingfrom a single transaction or secured by the same staples for: (i) Not more than 10 months if secured by nonperishable staples; and (ii) Not more than six months if secured by refrigerated or frozen staples.(6) The important characteristic of warehouse receipts, order bills oflading, or other similar documents is that the holder of such documentshas control of the commodity and can obtain immediate possession. (However,the existence of brief notice periods, or similar procedural requirementsunder state law, for the disposal of the collateral will not affect theeligibility of instruments for this exception.) Only documents with thesecharacteristics are eligible securities for loans under this exception.In the event of default on a loan secured by such documents, the bank mustbe in a position to sell the underlying commodity and promptly transfertitle and possession to the purchaser, thus being able to protect itselfwithout extended litigation. Generally, documents qualifying as ``documentsof title'' under the Uniform Commercial Code are ``similar documents''qualifying for this exception. (7) Field warehouse receipts are an acceptable form of collateral whenthey are issued by a duly bonded and licensed grain elevator or warehousehaving exclusive possession and control of the commodities even thoughthe grain elevator or warehouse is maintained on the commodity owner'spremise. (8) Warehouse receipts issued by the borrower-owner which is a grain elevatoror warehouse company, duly-bonded and licensed and regularly inspectedby state or federal authorities, may be considered eligible collateralunder this exception only when the receipts are registered with an independentregistrar whose consent is required before the commodities can be withdrawnfrom the warehouse. (d) <T3>Loans secured by U.S. obligations_</T3>(1) <T3>Law.</T3> 12 U.S.C. 84(c)(4) provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Loans or extensions of credit secured by bonds, notes, certificatesof indebtedness, or Treasury bills of the United States or by other suchobligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the UnitedStates shall not be subject to any limitations based on capital and surplus.</ITAG>(2) This exception applies only to the extent that loans or extensionsof credit are fully secured by the current market value of obligationsof the United States or guaranteed by the United States. (3) If the market value of the collateral declines to the extent that theloan is no longer in conformance with this exception and exceeds the general15 percent limitation, the loan must be brought into conformance withinfive business days. (e) <T3>Loans to or guaranteed by a federal agency_</T3>(1) <T3>Law.</T3> 12 U.S.C. 84(c)(5) provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Loans or extensions of credit to or secured by unconditional takeoutcommitments or guarantees of any department, agency, bureau, board, commission,or establishment of the United States or any corporation wholly owned directlyor indirectly by the United States shall not be subject to any limitationbased on capital and surplus.</ITAG>(2) This exception may apply to only that portion of a loan or extensionof credit that is covered by a federal guarantee or commitment.(3) For purposes of this exception, the commitment or guarantee must bepayable in cash or its equivalent within sixty days after demand for paymentis made. (4) A guarantee or commitment is unconditional if the protection affordedthe bank is not substantially diminished or impaired in the case of lossresulting from factors beyond the bank's control. Protection against lossis not materially diminished or impaired by procedural requirements, suchas an agreement to take over only in the event of default, including defaultover a specific period of time, a requirement that notification of defaultbe given within a specific period after its occurrence, or a requirementof good faith on the part of the bank. (f) <T3>Loans secured by segregated deposit accounts_</T3>(1) <T3>Law.</T3> 12 U.S.C. 84(c)(6) provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Loans or extensions of credit secured by a segregated deposit accountin the lending bank shall not be subject to any limitation based on capitaland surplus.</ITAG>(2) The bank must ensure that a security interest has been perfected inthe deposit, including the assignment of a specifically identified depositand any other actions required by state law. (3) Deposit accounts which may qualify for this exception include depositsin any form generally recognized as deposits. In the case of a depositeligible for withdrawal prior to the maturity of the secured loan, thebank must establish internal procedures which will prevent the releaseof the security. (4) A deposit which is denominated and payable in a currency other thanthat of the loan or extension of credit which it secures may be eligiblefor this exception if it is freely convertible to U.S. dollars. The depositmust be revalued at least monthly, using appropriate foreign exchange rates,to ensure that the loan or extension of credit remain fully secured. Thisexception applies to only that portion of the loan or extension of creditthat is covered by the U.S. dollar value of the deposit. If the U.S. dollarvalue of the deposit falls to the extent that the loan is in nonconformancewith this exception and exceeds the general 15 percent limitation, theloan must be brought into conformance within five business days, exceptwhere judicial proceedings, regulatory actions, or other extraordinaryoccurrences prevent the bank from taking such action. This exception isnot authority for national banks to take deposits denominated in foreigncurrencies. (g) <T3>Loans to financial institutions with the approval of the Comptroller_</T3>(1)<T3>Law.</T3> 12 U.S.C. 84(c)(7) provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Loans or extensions of credit to any financial institution or to anyreceiver, conservator, superintendent of banks, or other agent in chargeof the business and property of such financial institution, when such loansor extensions of credit are approved by the Comptroller of the Currency,shall not be subject to any limitation based on capital and surplus.</ITAG>(2) This exception is intended to apply only in emergency situations wherea national bank is called upon to provide assistance to another financialinstitution. (3) For purposes of this paragraph (g), ``financial institution'' meansa commercial bank, savings bank, trust company, savings and loan association,or credit union. (h) <T3>Discount of installment consumer paper_</T3>(1) <T3>Law.</T3> 12 U.S.C. 84(c)(8) provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Loans and extensions of credit arising from the discount of negotiableor nonnegotiable installment consumer paper which carries a full recourseendorsement or unconditional guarantee by the person transferring the papershall be subject under this section to a maximum limitation equal to 25per centum of such capital and surplus, notwithstanding the collateralrequirements set forth in subsection (a)(2). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) If the bank's files or the knowledge of its officers of the financialcondition of each maker of such consumer paper is reasonably adequate,and an officer of the bank designated for that purpose by the board ofdirectors of the bank certifies in writing that the bank is relying primarilyupon the responsibility of each maker for payment of such loans or extensionsof credit and not upon any full or partial recourse endorsement or guaranteeby the transferor, the limitations of this section as to the loans or extensionsof credit of each such maker shall be the sole applicable loan limitations.</ITAG>(2) This exception allows a national bank to discount negotiable or nonnegotiableinstallment consumer paper of one person in an amount equal to 10 percentof its capital and surplus (in addition to the 15 percent permitted bysection 84(a)(1)) if the paper carries a full recourse endorsement or unconditionalguarantee by the seller transferring such paper. The unconditional guaranteemay be in the form a repurchase agreement or a separate guarantee agreement.A condition reasonably within the power of the bank to perform, such asthe repossession of collateral, will not be considered to make conditionalan otherwise unconditional agreement. (3) For purposes of this paragraph (h), ``consumer'' means the user ofany products, commodities, goods, or services, whether leased or purchased,and does not include any person who purchases products or commodities forthe purpose of resale or for fabrication into goods for sale.(4) For purposes of this paragraph (h), ``consumer paper'' includes paperrelating to automobiles, mobile homes, residences, office equipment, householditems, tuition fees, insurance premium fees, and similar consumer items.Also included is paper covering the lease (where the bank is not the owneror lessor) or purchase of equipment for use in manufacturing, farming,construction, or excavation. (5) Under certain circumstances, installment consumer paper which otherwisemeets the requirements of this exception will be considered a loan or extensionof credit to the maker of the paper rather than the seller of the paper.Specifically, where: (i) Through the bank's files it has been determined that the financialcondition of each maker is reasonably adequate to repay the loan or extensionof credit, and (ii) An officer designated by the bank's Chairman or Chief Executive Officerpursuant to authorization by the Board of Directors certifies in writingthat the bank is relying primarily upon the maker to repay the loan orextension of credit, the loan or extension of credit is subject only tothe lending limits of the maker of the paper. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Where paper is purchased in substantial quantities, the records, evaluation,and certification may be in such form as is appropriate for the class andquantity of paper involved. (i) <T3>Loans secured by livestock or dairy cattle_ </T3>(1) <T3>Loans secured by livestock_ </T3>(i) <T3>Law. </T3>12 U.S.C. 84(c)(9)(A) provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Loans and extensions of credit secured by shipping documents or instrumentstransferring or securing title covering livestock or giving a lien on livestockwhen the market value of the livestock securing the obligation is not atany time less than 115 per centum of the face amount of the note covered,shall be subject under this section, notwithstanding the collateral requirementsset forth in subsection (a)(2), to a maximum limitation equal to 25 percentum of such capital and surplus.</ITAG>(ii) This exception allows a national bank to make loans or extensionsof credit to one person in an amount equal to 10 percent of its capitaland surplus (in addition to the 15 percent permitted by section 84(a)(1)),if the loans or extensions of credit are secured by livestock having amarket value at least equal to 115 percent of the outstanding loan balanceat all times. The loans or extensions of credit may be secured by shippingdocuments or other instruments which transfer title to, secure title to,or give a first lien on livestock. ``Livestock'' includes dairy and beefcattle, hogs, sheep, goats, horses, mules, poultry, and fish, whether ornot held for resale. To support compliance with this exception, the bankmust maintain in its files an inspection and appraisal report on the livestockpledged. The inspection and appraisal report should be performed at leastevery 12 months, or more frequently as deemed prudent. (iii) Under the laws of certain states, a person furnishing pasturage undera grazing contract may have a lien on the livestock for the amount duefor pasturage. If the lien which is based on pasturage furnished by thelienor prior to the making of the loan:(A) Is assigned to the bank by a recordable instrument and (B) Is protected against being defeated by some other lien or claim, bypayment to a person other than the bank, or otherwise, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">it would qualify under this exception provided the amount of suchperfected lien is at least equal to the amount of the loan and the valueof the livestock is at no time less than 115 percent of the loan. Wherethe amount due under the grazing contract is dependent upon future performancethereunder, the resulting lien has merely prospective value and does notmeet the requirements of the exception.(2) <T3>Loans secured by dairy cattle_</T3>(i) <T3>Law.</T3> 12 U.S.C. 84(c)(9)(B) provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Loans and extensions of credit which arise from the discount by dealersin dairy cattle of paper given in payment for dairy cattle, which papercarries a full recourse endorsement or unconditional guarantee of the seller,and which are secured by the cattle being sold, shall be subject underthis section, notwithstanding the collateral requirements set forth insubsection (a)(2), to a limitation of 25 per centum of such capital andsurplus.</ITAG>(ii) This exception allows a national bank to discount paper of one persongiven in payment for dairy cattle in an amount equal to 10 percent of itscapital and surplus (in addition to the 15 percent permitted by section84(a)(1)). The discounted paper must carry the full recourse endorsementor unconditional guarantee of the seller and the dairy cattle must securethe debt. Liens on the cattle may be in any form which allows the bankto maintain a perfected security interest in the cattle under applicablestate law.(3) The exception for loans and extensions of credit secured by livestockis separate and apart from the exception for loans and extensions of creditcreated by the discount of paper for the purchase of dairy cattle. Therefore,a national bank may make loans or extensions of credit to one person securedby each type of collateral in an amount equal to 10 percent of its capitaland surplus (in addition to the 15 percent permitted under section 84(a)(1)).(j) <T3>Loans to Student Loan Marketing Association.</T3> 12 U.S.C. 84(c)(10)provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Loans or extensions of credit to the Student Loan Marketing Associationshall not be subject to any limitation based on capital and surplus. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 32.9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Transitional rules. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T4>Note:</T4> Old andSection; 32.7 with significant changes.](a) Loans and extensions of credit which were in violation of 12 U.S.C.84 prior to the relevant effective dates of this Part will be consideredto remain in violation of section 84 and subject to actions under 12 U.S.C.93 and 1818, and other appropriate laws after those dates until they arepaid in full, regardless of whether the loans and extensions of creditconform to the rules established in this part.
