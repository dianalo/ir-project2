(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tammy Faye Bakker said in a fund-raisingletter to 400,000 people that her husband lay in a fetal positionfor hours while she prayed for death and could not stop cryingafter their departure from the PTL ministry.   ``I did not know I could cry so hard,'' she wrote in a packetasking for donations to help the couple buy back the ministry. ``Idid not know I could laugh so loudly. I did not know I coulddislike God so much. I did not know I could love God so much.''   Mrs. Bakker's thoughts on leaving the ministry last year in themidst of her husband's sex-and-money scandal are contained in afour-page brochure on its way to supporters. The State newspaper ofColumbia printed excerpts in today's editions.   The packet contains a letter from Bakker asking for donationsranging from $25 to $1,000. Contributors are promised a copy ofMrs. Bakker's new album, ``Peace in the Midst of the Storm.''   The appeal is part of Bakker's effort to buy back the ministryhe abandoned after acknowledging a sexual affair with churchsecretary Jessica Hahn.   The ministry filed for protection under Chapter 11 of thebankruptcy code two months after Bakker left in March 1987. Bakkernow appears to be the leading contender to buy it back.   Bankruptcy Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton extended from Tuesday toThursday a deadline for Bakker to raise $3 million to demonstratehe can make good on his offer of $172 million for the ministry'sassets. Benton had said Friday that if the $3 million wasn'tavailable by Tuesday he would be forced to consider other bids.   Bakker said he was about $100,000 short of raising the $3million in cash and letters of credit.   Benton will recommend a proposed buyer to U.S. Bankruptcy JudgeRufus Reynolds, who must approve any sale. Reynolds set a Saturdaydeadline for submission of bids.   Bakker and Benton told reporters Tuesday after an hourlongmeeting they were still working out final details of a contract forBakker to buy PTL's assets, which include the Heritage USAChristian theme park and hotel complex, a satellite TV network andundeveloped property near the Fort Mill ministry.   Bakker said supporters nationwide are pledging money for thepurchase.   ``It's the most fantastic thing I've ever seen,'' he said.   Benton has given Bakker until Friday to present him with thedetails of Bakker's deal with a group of Greek businessmen Bakkersays are backing his bid.   The trustee said he has ``four or five'' other bids for PTLbesides Bakker's, along with an an offer of $113 million byCanadian real estate executive Peter Thomas.   Mrs. Bakker told reporters Tuesday she was ``so excited'' aboutthe possibility of returning to the couple's TV show that she wasrehearsing her opening song.   ``It will be `The Sun Will Shine Again,''' she said.   In the mailing, Mrs. Bakker described her feelings after Bakkeradmitted his sexual misconduct and turned PTL over to the Rev.Jerry Falwell. The Bakkers later left their Tega Cay parsonage andmoved to Gatlinburg, Tenn.   ``My stomach was so sick all the time I could not evenswallow,'' she wrote. ``I didn't want to wake up in the morning. Iprayed to die!''   ``Where was God? Did He care that I was hurting so bad. Did Hecare that Jim would lie curled up in a fetal position for hourafter hour.''   She also recalled her reaction when Falwell asked the Bakkers toleave their Tega Cay parsonage.   ``I heard those words and terror gripped my heart. ... We hadraised our children there, we had put our marriage back together inthat house. Max and Snuggles and Muffie, our dogs, were playing intheir yard! Tinkerbell and Hooter, our kittens, were there. ...   ``How I longed for my bed! The place of safety for me. Our placeof rest after a hard day!''</TEXT></DOC>
