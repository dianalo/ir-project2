(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michigan officials followed the letter, butnot the spirit of divestiture when they went on an 11th-hour buyingspree, snapping up South African-related stocks days before a ban onsuch investments took effect.   Treasurer Robert Bowman ordered the December purchases on behalfof the state's $15.7 billion pension fund. They came just before anew law went into effect on New Year's Day and banned newinvestments of state pension funds in companies with South Africanties.   ``It makes me sick. It clearly goes against the spirit of thelaw,'' said Thea Todd, co-coordinator of the Michigan LeadershipCoalition for South Africa Divestment.   ``He didn't violate anything, that's clear, but if he wereclearly in the spirit of it, he wouldn't go out and buy right at theend,'' said state Sen. Dan DeGrow, a sponsor of the measure designedto protest apartheid.   The stock buy was part of $902 million in purchases made througha fund that buys in a single package all 478 stocks listed on theStandard and Poors 500 index, Bowman said, adding that three-fourthsof the stocks listed in the index have no South Afican ties.   A review of the index indicated at least 94 companies were on alist released by Bowman last week of companies believed to haveSouth African ties and are now off-limits for state investments.   ``The goal was not, of course, to buy companies that wouldultimately be proscribed, but this is our last chance to buy theindex fund,'' he said Wednesday.   ``The spirit of the law wasn't violated because the treasurerdidn't cherry pick any specific stocks and buy them. To violate thespirit of the law would be to go out and buy index firms we knew hadSouth African ties,'' said Robert Kolt, Bowman's spokesman.   Topping the list of stocks bought of companies with South Africanties was IBM, $34,469,961 worth. Others included General ElectricCo., $19,374,122; American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., $14,986,177;General Motors Corp., $12,514,653; Ford Motor Co., $12,075,821.   Bowman said the state had been in and out of the Standard andPoors fund over the last 18 months and he decided in December tobeef up its stake in the stock market.   ``We moved money into the index fund. It's a way to move a lot ofmoney into the stock market and bet on the stock market,'' Koltsaid, adding that the treasurer's office has a responsibility underthe law to maximize the return on its investments, as well as divestof South African stocks.   Thomas Scott, a spokesman for Gov. James Blanchard, who endorsedthe law, said Bowman's actions don't indicate the administrationlacks commitment to divestiture.   ``The governor expects and has no reason to believe otherwisethat the divestiture law he and Treasurer Bowman pushed for will becarried out according to the full spirit and letter of the law,''Scott said.   The new law bars the pension fund from buying stock in companiesthat have ties to South Africa, and gives it five years to sell offstock in those companies, which totals $5 billion.   The law also applies to 45 municipal pension funds.</TEXT></DOC>
