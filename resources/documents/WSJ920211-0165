The new products will put Compaq in competition withindustry rivals such as Hewlett-Packard Co., the leadinglaser-printer maker, in a fast-growing market that accountedfor well over $1 billion in world-wide sales last year.</LP><TEXT>   Industry executives said Compaq won't try to compete withHewlett in the huge mainstream market for smaller,stand-alone laser printers. They added that though thecompany has recruited executives for a printer division andis setting up operations in the U.S. and Germany, detailscould still change before the machine's planned U.S. debut inMay. Compaq, based in Houston, has previously scotchedtentative plans to launch a laser-printer product line.   In a telephone interview from Germany, Compaq ChiefExecutive Officer Eckhard Pfeiffer declined to talk about thecompany's efforts to produce laser printers.   According to the industry executives, Compaq's machinesare envisioned as head-to-head competitors for Hewlett's17-page-a-minute LaserJet IIIsi printer, the main contenderin a segment that is growing much faster than the generalmarket for laser printers. In Europe, for example, sales of12- to 19-page-a-minute laser printers grew 72% to $340million last year -- and are expected to continue growing ata compound annual rate of 31% for the next five years.   In the U.S., the category exploded during 1991, withrevenue almost quadrupling to $879 million, according to BISStrategic Decisions, a market research firm.   For its new machines, Compaq would use a printer &quot;engine&quot;made by Fuji Xerox Co., a Japanese joint venture of FujiPhoto Film Co. and Rank Xerox Ltd., but would contribute muchof the remaining technology itself, the executives said.Japan dominates the market for laser-printer engines,primarily through Canon Inc., which supplies the guts ofseveral printer brands, including Hewlett's all-conqueringLaserJet family.   Rank Xerox Ltd., a U.K.-based joint venture between XeroxCorp. and Rank Organisation PLC, is itself a low-endcompetitor in the European market for printers in the 12- to19-page-a-minute range. Other sellers of printers in thisspeed category include Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'sPanasonic brand, Kyocera Corp., Fujitsu Ltd., QMS Inc.,Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business MachinesCorp.  Lexmark International Inc., a recent IBM laser printerspinoff, based in Lexington, Ky., also plans to enter thefaster segment during 1992.   Designed to function in a PC network, the new Compaqprinters will likely be portrayed as plug-and-play componentsfor high-performance corporate networks, a business area thatCompaq has been trying to expand lately.   While noncommittal about the company's chance of successas a printer maker, industry analysts said Compaq willcertainly benefit from a new way to differentiate itself frommakers of cheap &quot;clone&quot; PCs, which have become the bane ofits existence lately.   &quot;A lot of companies have been caught by surprise bysuccess of the clone companies,&quot; said U.K.-based printeranalyst Greg Porell, of BIS Strategic Decisions. &quot;As the PCmarket has become price-driven, Compaq's market share hasdropped. What they're doing now is looking for ways to getincremental business -- and maybe offering a printer willgive them an edge in the corporate market.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
