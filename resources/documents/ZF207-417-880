Federal Hwy.,andO;Boca Raton, FL 33487; (407) 997-6055.andM;List Price: $99andM;Requires: 256K RAM, DOS 2.0 or later.andM;In Short:  COREfast's multitude of options makes it especially suitable fornetwork environments.andP;  But the menu interface is more awkward than it needsto be, error correction is weak, and single-file restores are glacially slow.andM;Most backup packages consist of a flimsy paperback manual and a disk.andO;COREfast comes in a sturdy, cloth-covered slipcase and ring binder that makethe whole thing look a lot like the DOS manual.andP;  Sometimes you can tell aprogram by its cover, and CORE International's $99 backup package is in everyway the serious, heavyweight program that it appears to be It does almosteverything, and with impressive speed.andP;  The clumsiest thing about COREfast isthat overweight manual, which is so badly organized and indexed that you'rebetter off ignoring it and using the extensive help screens instead.andM;COREfast lets you back up and restore to any disk or DOS device that you canidentify with a drive letter, including a network server.andP;  It has a built-infile manager that lets you view, copy, or rename files before decidingwhether to list them automatically in a catalog of files to include in abackup--and you can create catalogs and configuration files from manyconvenient points in the menus.andP;  COREfast includes an optional 4Kmemory-resident scheduler that can run backups or restores at any specifiedtime; it also can run programs or issue any DOS or network command before orafter the backup or restore itself.andP;  COREfast normally uses a proprietaryhigh-speed disk format unreadable by DOS, but you can choose to create backupdisks that use DOS formatting instead--and you'll have to use DOS formattingif you back up to anything other than a floppy disk.andP;  COREfast even lets youmake image backups, although you should normally avoid doing anything of thekind.andM;Like most high-tech backup programs, COREfast offers two levels of datacompression and three levels of verification.andP;  By default it backs up allfiles, including the DOS system files, but you can tell it to ignore anycombination of hidden, system, read-only, or Novell-sharable files.andP;  And likeany self-respecting advanced backup program, COREfast lets you set a daterange for files to back up and lets you decide whether or not the programshould reset the archive bit after backing up files.andM;If you're a backup beginner, COREfast starts you off with simple menus thatgive access to simple backup-and-restore functions suitable forunsophisticated users.andP;  But when you feel more confident, you should switchto an advanced menu level with a few keystrokes.andP;  Only the advanced levelgives you access to crucial switches, like the ones that control whetherhidden or system files will be backed up.andP;  When you feel really expert, youcan dispense with the menus altogether and use command-line switches tocontrol the separate programs that are normally concealed behind the menus.andM;COREfast's performance in the PC Labs timing benchmark tests places it justbelow the top rank of backup programs--an impressive performance for anapplication so rich in features.andP;  Yet for all its power and range, COREfastsuffers from some major and minor inconveniences.andP;  A minor one is the way themenus require you to jump around the function keys (or the number keys on thetop line of the keyboard) to get anywhere.andP;  The list of function keys isarbitrary (although F1 always brings up help), and the arrangement offunction keys on submenus bears no relation to the arrangements on the menusabove them.andP;  If COREfast allowed you to type the initial letters of menuchoices, or even move a scroll bar, you could use it more easily andaccurately.andM;COREfast's error correction isn't perfect, either.andP;  It overwrites disks fromearlier backups without any special warning beyond its standard statementthat all data will be overwritten on the disk.andP;  If you open the drive door atthe wrong time, you have to start the backup over from the beginning.andP;  Andwhen COREfast tried to format a scratched floppy, it just kept trying andtrying until I gave up and rebooted.andM;COREfast also gets seriously inconvenient when you want to restore one or twofiles.andP;  The log file on the hard disk and the catalog on the first backupdisk lists all backed-up files--but neither one can tell you or the programwhich disk contains which file.andP;  You have to feed backup floppy disks intothe drive one by one until the file you need finally turns up.andP;  If yourback-up consists of 20 or more floppy disks, this can mean a long wait.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
