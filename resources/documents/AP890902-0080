KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congress, facing a crowded foreign policyagenda marked by both crisis and opportunity, apparently is eager tohelp Poland with significantly more aid than proposed by PresidentBush.   But although Democratic and Republican leaders agree on the needto help Poland's new government demonstrate it can outperform thecommunist regime it replaced, there is little sense of how muchadditional money can be squeezed out of an already overburdenedbudget.   Overall, there is growing unease on Capitol Hill that the meansavailable do not match the magnitude of the global problems waitingto be addressed.   These include: How to deal with the challenge to the authority ofthe government of Colombia by narcotics racketeers, how best to wagethe war on drugs, how to manage an era of warmer relations with theSoviet Union, and how to deal with China in the aura of anger causedby the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.   House and Senate members are ending their summer recess andstreaming back to Capitol Hill, many fresh from visits to nationswhose problems Congress will soon seek to address.   One of the trips claimed the life of Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas,whose airplane crashed into a mountainside en route to a refugeecamp in Ethiopia. Many of Leland's colleagues vow to carry on hisefforts to combat world hunger.   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas returned from a visitwith Poland's new leaders campaigning for increased aid and SenateMajority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, an apparent ally, says,``Those members with whom I have talked believe we should go beyondthe $100 million the president proposed.   ``I think the events occurring in Poland could be historic innature and we ought to be doing everything we can to encourage theconversion of that government from communist to non communist,''Mitchell said.   ``The primary thing is food,'' Dole said. ``They want to fill theshelves. They want to show change. People expect things to getbetter. We need to act quickly.''   Poland is plagued with serious consumer shortages and there arelong lines for the few goods available for sale.   But Dole said there are only ``vague'' ideas of how to find themoney to pay for new assistance. And Mitchell said the finaldimensions of an aid package will not emerge for some time.''   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a former chairman of the SenateForeign Relations Committee, says private capital, not governmentaid, is likely to prove the answer as Poland struggles to build anon-communist future.   Lugar visited nine Latin American nations in 14 days of thesummer recess, focusing on the problems of narcotics, and hugeforeign debts.   Congress is likely to be highly supportive of U.S. efforts tohelp Colombia battle armed narcotics traffickers who recently tookresponsibility for murdering a leading presidential candidate.   ``It has focused the world's attention on how fragile agovernment can be,'' Lugar said.   Support also is strong for efforts to eradicate coca crops _ fromwhich the cocaine is produced _ in such countries as Colombia,Bolivia and Peru.   But Lugar said the lure of enormous profits is so great that hedoes not believe eradication and crop substitution will lead toanything but the removal of coca production to other fields in othercountries.   ``It boggles the imagination as to how you control this,'' Lugarsaid.   The war against drugs will be won only through a determinedcampaign to reduce consumption, Lugar said.   One of his colleagues, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., is taking theother tack, pressing for adoption of a ``debt for drugs'' exchangein which Latin American nations guarantee the destruction ofnarcotics crops in return for relief from some of the burden oftheir large external debt.   Calls on the United States to intervene to destroy narcoticscrops with U.S. personnel are expected, but Lugar and others advisedextreme caution.   Attempts to use U.S. forces to destroy coca crops in Peru, Lugarsaid, might well inject those forces into an internal civil war withPeru's Shining Path guerillas who are centered in narcoticsproducing regions.   Congress is also closely following strategic arms control talkswith the Soviet Union in Geneva and negotiations on reducingconventional arms in Europe in Vienna.   Most congressional observers feel that agreement on sharplyreducing nuclear weapons will not come quickly, but thatconventional reductions are on a faster track.   There is movement, meanwhile, to suspend the trade restrictionsimposed by the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment as the Soviet Unioneases emigration controls on Jews and other minority groups. ``Ithasn't jelled yet,'' Lugar says.   The House is to vote this week on legislation granting Hungarymost-favored nation trade status in recognition of steps taken toliberalize the Hungarian economy.   Trade issues _ especially with Japan _ remain on thecongressional front burner as do efforts to free U.S. hostages inLebanon.   On the horizon are the opening of negotiations on military baserights with the Philippines. Lugar noted that the government ofSingapore has asked that its territory be considered for U.S. basesif the U.S-Philippine talks collapse.   He also predicted a ``lively discussion'' on the role of the U.S.military presence in Asia, especially in South Korea where U.S.forces have been stationed since the end of the Korean war in the1950s.   In the Senate, a number of Bush's appointments to key embassiesremain under fire by Democrats who complain the nominees have novisible qualifications other than large contributions to Republicancampaigns.   The nomination of Donald Gregg, who served as Bush's vicepresidential foreign policy adviser, remains in doubt because ofallegations he misled the Senate Foreign Relations Committee abouthis alleged links to the Iran-Contra affair.   The rest of the menu includes continued U.S. aid toanti-communist rebels in Afghanistan, the resolution of conflictinvolving Angola and Namibia, continuing protests against apartheidrule in South Africa, and the prospects for free elections in theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza.</TEXT></DOC>
