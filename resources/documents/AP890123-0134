White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the absence of theribbon does not reflect any lack of concern by the new president forthe fate of the hostages held in the Middle East.   Fitzwater said the ribbon was affixed to the entrance to the WestWing of the White House by President Reagan's secretary KathleenOsborne. He said he did not know whether she or anyone else fromReagan's staff took it down.   But, he said, ``President Bush's concern for the hostages isstrong and is a problem that is continually in his thoughts and inhis planning.''   Osborne works for Reagan now that the former president hasretired to California but she was not in Monday, said Reagan'sspokesman Mark Weinberg. Weinberg said he did not know what hadhappened to the ribbon.   The ribbon was given to Reagan by families of the hostages heldby extremists in Lebanon, and Osborne placed it on the door inOctober 1985.   The State Department says nine Americans are among the foreignhostages: Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, Thomas Sutherland, dean of agriculture at theAmerican University of Beirut, Frank Herbert Reed, director of theLebanon International School in Beirut; Joseph James Cicippio,acting comptroller of the American University of Beirut; EdwardAustin Tracy, author; Jesse Jonathan Turner, visiting professor atBeirut University College; Robert Polhill, assistant professor atBeirum University College; Alann Steen, professor at BeirutUniversity College; Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, head of a75-man observer group attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
