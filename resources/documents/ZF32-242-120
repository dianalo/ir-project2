(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Apple's latest line on the delivery of System 7.0 is &quot;the first half of1991,&quot; but developers received a beta version in November.andP;  MacWEEK recentlypreviewed that version, 7.0b1, from an end user's point of view.andP;  In Part 1of our two-part report, we take a tour of the new Finder.andP;  Part 2, which willappear next week, will focus on System 7.0's new technologies, such asInterapplication Communications, file sharing, the Data Access Manager andTrueType.andM;By Mike MortonandM;The Finder is where the Mac experience begins, and under System 7.0 it'sever-present, so that is where our tour begins.andM;The Finder has, until now, changed relatively little since the Mac'sintroduction seven years ago, and it has begun to show its age.andM;The new version, however, represents a major overhaul in appearance andfunctionality.andP;  If you're using at least 16 colors or grays, you'll notice anew look to windows and icons.andP;  They now have a colorful 3-D appearance,along the lines of Windows 3.0 and the NeXT interface.andM;Menus are also enhanced.andP;  Starting at the left, you'll notice that the Applemenu looks familiar, except for small icons next to each item.andP;  About ThisMacintosh shows the usual information about your hardware, software andmemory usage.andP;  (A minimum of 2 Mbytes of RAM is required.)andM;The memory-usage statistics are somewhat alarming: The Finder and System bothhave grown quite a bit in 7.0.andP;  Don't panic, though.andP;  Virtual memory makes itpossible to run large applications even with relatively little RAM.andM;The Apple menu has an expanded role in the new system, offering quick accessto frequently used applications, documents and folders as well as deskaccessories.andP;  You don't need the Font/DA Mover; you just drag icons into theApple Menu Items folder in the System folder.andP;  The Apple menu is instantlyupdated; you don't need to restart.andP;  (Since the functions of MultiFinder arenow built directly into the System, you can always get to the desktop to makesuch changes.)andM;Control Panel goes upscale.andM;The Control Panel DA has been replaced by a menu item called Control Panels.andO;Selecting it opens a folder of the same name inside the System folder.andP;  Theicons here, such as Monitors and Chooser, are applications that could be keptanywhere on your disk.andP;  The Control Panels folder is just a convenient placeto store them.andM;New System 7.0 cdevs include:andM;andgt;Labels, which works with the Finder's Labels menu, a replacement for theColor menu.andP;  Icons can belong to one of seven color-coded categories, whichyou can now name to help arrange your desktop.andM;andgt;Views, which lets you control the display of items in Finder windows.andP;  Youcan choose the font and size of names, and icons can be laid out in even rowsor staggered.andP;  In list views, you can control which attributes are shown,including labels and Get Info comments.andM;andgt;Sharing Setup, User Setup and File Sharing Monitor, a trio of relatedControl Panels that let you manage how data stored on your Macintosh is madeavailable to other users on the same network with the new system's FileSharing feature.andP;  File Sharing, a sort of serverless equivalent ofAppleShare, lets users give access to selected folders on their local disk tonetworked colleagues.andM;Lifting the memory barrier.andM;Support for virtual memory (using disk space as if it were RAM, allowing youto open applications and documents that wouldn't fit into your actual RAM) isbuilt into System 7.0.andP;  But you probably will not want to use virtual memory,at least in Apple's implementation, as a permanent substitute for more RAM,because it is perceptibly slower than real memory.andP;  Also, we found that onour IIsi the disk I/O for virtual memory made the mouse painfully jumpy, andeven Apple admits that it &quot;is not recommended for everyday work.&quot;andM;When you need to squeeze in one more running application, however, virtualmemory can be helpful.andP;  And performance may well improve before Applereleases 7.0.andM;When running on Macs with 32-bit-clean ROMs (the Mac IIci, IIsi and IIfx),System 7.0 supports 32-bit addressing, giving users access to much largeramounts of real RAM (up to 128 Mbytes in the case of the IIfx and IIci) andup to almost 2 Gbytes of virtual memory, depending on your hardwareconfiguration (see table, Page TK).andP;  Apple says it can't guarantee thatthird-party 68030 upgrade cards for machines such as the SE and II will beable to take advantage of virtual memory.andM;File-menu additions.andM;Make Alias is a seemingly minor feature that can be immensely useful.andP;  Analias looks like a copy of the original file, but the name is italicized andit's not a space-consuming duplicate -- it just remembers where the originalitem is.andP;  You could, for example, keep aliases of your favorite applicationson the desktop or in the Apple Menu Item folder for easy launching, while theoriginals are stored in an Applications folder.andM;In System 7.0, the Finder finally lives up to its name.andP;  The new Find commandsearches for files not only by name but also by size, kind, label, creationand modification dates, Get Info comments and version numbers.andP;  The mostpowerful feature of Find is probably the All at once check box, which findsand selects all documents matching the search criterion, even if they are indifferent folders.andP;  Want to throw away all last year's documents?andP;  Just checkthis box, search for a creation date before Jan.andP;  1 and drag to the Trash.andM;Other menus.andM;The Finder's Edit menu is essentially unchanged, although in supportingapplications you will find System 7.0's Publish and Subscribe commands there.andO;The View menu includes the new file attributes Label, Version and Comments.andM;The Special menu operates a little differently.andP;  The Trash has been madesafer: It's never emptied, even after a restart, except when you ask it tobe.andM;Two new, small icons that appear at the right end of the menu bar are menus.andO;The Applications menu lists all active applications and DAs and lets you hideall windows of your current application or all other applications.andM;The Help menu includes Show Balloons, which you simply select, then move themouse to whatever you want to know about.andP;  A cartoon-style balloon appearswith a brief explanation.andP;  Third-party applications must be upgraded to takeadvantage of this feature.andM;Finder windows.andM;Turning to the desktop, you can see that the Finder's windows have many newfeatures.andM;andgt;Outlines in list views.andP;  Finder windows can now show more than onehierarchical level when using a list view.andP;  Each folder has a small triangleto its left.andP;  Clicking a triangle shows or hides that folder's contents.andM;andgt;Navigating through folders.andP;  The Command-Up arrow opens the parent disk orfolder of the active window.andP;  The Command-Down arrow opens a selection.andP;  Youcan climb up more than one level in the folder hierarchy by Command-clickingon the name in the title bar.andP;  This turns it into a pop-up menu much like theone in the Open and Save As dialogs.andP;  Using the Option key with any of thenavigation functions closes the current window.andM;The Arrow keys select the next icon in any direction, while the Tab keyselects the next icon in alphabetical order.andP;  Typing the first few letters ofa name will select its icon.andM;andgt;The Desktop.andP;  There is now a unifying level above all disks called theDesktop.andP;  Instead of using the old Drive button, you now change disks bymoving to the Desktop level.andP;  This level lists all disks, documents andfolders on the desktop.andM;andgt;Put Away.andP;  This command also can be used to dismount disks.andM;Apple has done a lot to enhance the Finder in other ways.andP;  It can now copyfiles in the background while you work in other applications.andP;  Dragging anitem from a background window no longer makes the window active.andP;  Dragging aselection to the edge of a window makes the window auto-scroll, and clickinga window's zoom box makes it just large enough to show its contents.andP;  In alist view, clicking on category titles sorts by that attribute.andM;The System folder.andM;The System folder and System file are now easier to view, organize andupdate.andP;  Drag any Control Panel, DA, font, sound or other System add-on ontop of the System folder and it will automatically land in the correctsubfolder, eliminating much of the guesswork for beginners.andP;  Along with theApple Menu Items and Control Panels folders, organizing folders includePreferences (for application-specific files), Startup Items (for DAs,documents and applications to be opened at start-up) and Extensions (foradd-in software such as Startup documents, or INITs; printer drivers; andAppleShare software).andM;The System file itself, once a forbidden zone to all but hardy resourcehackers, can finally be opened.andP;  Double-clicking on it reveals fonts andsounds.andP;  You can then open any font to view a sample of it or any sound tohear it played.andM;Conclusions.andM;In typical Apple fashion, the beta version of System 7.0 adds the message&quot;You're gonna love it!&quot; to the &quot;Welcome to Macintosh&quot; text on the start-upscreen.andP;  We did.andP;  We were consistently impressed by the power of 7.0'sfile-management tools, networking capabilities and application integration.andM;Ease of learning and ease of use for the beginner haven't been compromised.andO;Balloon help, new menus and an overhaul of System folder management areelegantly implemented.andP;  Apple has done a good job with the user interfaceeven in difficult areas that are inherently complex, such as controllingaccess to shared data.andM;We're not so sure Apple is standing by underpowered machines.andP;  While IIfxowners will love 7.0, users with 68000-based machines or only 2 or 3 Mbytesof RAM may want to test-drive it to see if its performance is acceptable.andP;  Ifnetworked sites need to test it out, they can easily change partially to 7.0because installation can be done over AppleTalk, and 6.0x and 7.0 printerdrivers are compatible.andM;Apple hasn't set a price for System 7.0, but if it's anywhere close to the$49 charged for System 6.0, it'll be a real bargain.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
