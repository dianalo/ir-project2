REPANSHEK</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Voters cast ballots today to fillWyoming's lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, vacatedwhen Dick Cheney was nominated defense secretary.   The 40-day campaign often turned negative with the twofrontrunners, Democrat John Vinich and Republican Craig Thomas,engaging in heated exchanges.   The special election was watched by both national parties. TheRepublicans hoped to salvage some pride after earlier this yearlosing special elections in Indiana and Alabama; Democratics hopedfor a sweep with a Vinich victory.   Officials predict turnout will be about 65 percent of registeredvoters, slightly lower than normal.   Some voters had had enough of the campaign.   ``It's negative. It's dirty. It's sleazy,'' Cheyenne residentLee Foster said of the GOP campaign that called into questionVinich's integrity and the Democratic portrayal of Thomas as a GOPpawn.   Appearing on the ballot as independents were Craig McCune, aCheyenne railroad engineer who collected just 1,900 votes when heran for the House seat as a Libertarian last November, and DanielJohnson, a white separatist who moved from California to Wyoming inmid-March.   Neither McCune nor Johnson were expected to gain many votes,although the Casper Star-Tribune, Wyoming's largest newspaper,endorsed McCune because of the ``assassination politics'' displayedby Vinich and Thomas.   In the last 10 days, polling by the Democrats and Republicansshowed a slight trend toward Thomas.   Vinich has been campaigning for 19 months, beginning when heentered a race for U.S. Sen. Malcolm Wallop's seat. He narrowlylost, and then won the Democratic nomination for Cheney's seat.   Thomas, 56, is general manager of the Wyoming Rural ElectricAssociation who was elected in November to his third term in theLegislature. Vinich, 38, is a restaurant and bar owner who hasspent the last 15 years in the Legislature.   At one point in the race, the National Republican CongressionalCommittee seemed on the verge of torpedoing its own man's campaign.   Ed Rollins, a high-paid strategist hired to reverse GOPfortunes, played into Vinich's hands by declaring that he wascalling the shots for Thomas.   ``Wyoming is something I've had hands on since day one,'' saidRollins.   Vinich used the comments to charge that Thomas didn't controlhis campaign. But the Democrats had their share of mistakes. Thebulk of Vinich's campaign contributions came from out-of-statelabor groups; Thomas then portrayed the Democrat as beholden toorganized labor with little Wyoming support.   Vinich also attacked Thomas for being ``soft on crime'' becauseof a legislative vote the Republican cast in favor of asplit-sentencing bill. But the bill was opposed by only twolegislators and even former Gov. Ed Herschler, a highly popularDemocrat, disagreed with Vinich's position.</TEXT></DOC>
