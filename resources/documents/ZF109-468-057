 Increasingly, WallStreet is looking at Motorola as a play on growth in personal communicationsrather than filing it -- and usually discounting it -- under &quot;S&quot; forsemiconductor.andM;With semiconductor stocks still hospitalized, or at best convalescing, wewouldn't quarrel with investors who prefer that taxonomy.andP;  Not being in thestock picking business, though, we think it is still worthwhile to look atMotorola from a semiconductor perspective.andP;  For one thing, Motorola'sSemiconductor Products Sector is in the process of edging ahead of TexasInstruments for the title of largest American merchant chipmaker.andP;  With50,000 line items for sale, it is also the broadest.andP;  Conventional wisdomquestions whether big, broad American semiconductor companies can prosperagainst bigger Asian competitors and more focused Americans.andM;The prosperity of Motorola Semiconductor matters to a lot of people, startingwith Motorola CEO George Fisher, who counts on the chip business for a thirdof corporate revenues and lavishes half the company's capital budget on it.andO;The semiconductor operation is important also to Motorola's equipmentbusinesses, which in the last few years have been urged toward ever-closercollaboration with their silicon brethren.andP;  The hot-selling ten-ounce MICROTAC cellular phone, which still has no direct competition, is stuffed withMotorola chips.andM;More than just interested bystanders are Apple Computer, Commodore, HewlettPackard, NCR, Data General, NeXT, Encore, and other companies that havestaked at least a part of their future on Motorola chips.andP;  In the broadestsense, the success of Motorola Semiconductor is a crucial test case forAmerican technology at a time when its position of leadership seems in doubt.andM;So how is it going in Phoenix, where Sector President Jim Norling hangs hishat, and in Austin, home of the critically important Microprocessor ProductsGroup?andM;Fortunes of warandM;Based on the recent record, Motorola Semiconductor appears to be doingremarkably well for a big guy.andP;  The other broad-based American semiconductorproducers -- TI, Advanced Micro Devices, and National Semiconductor -- allstruggled last year and into the first quarter of this year with sluggishsales and anemic or nonexistent earnings.andP;  Even Intel's semiconductorbusiness showed little growth until the latest quarter, when 80386microprocessor sales took off again.andM;Revenues at Motorola Semiconductor, meanwhile, were up last year arespectable 11% to $3 billion, slightly ahead of TI's semiconductor sales forthe first time.andP;  Operating earnings fell 30% but still came in at $188million or 6.4% of sales.andP;  (TI's operating margin in semiconductors was abouthalf that level, but royalty income made its chip business substantially moreprofitable than Motorola's.)andM;Texas as Number 2andM;The Motorola story got even better in the first quarter.andP;  Despite generalpredictions for a flat year in the chip industry, Mr. Norling started 1990with a 13% increase in sales and a 14% gain in orders.andP;  Motorola'sbook-to-bill ratio is pushing 1.2, well ahead of the industry average,meaning orders are running 20% ahead of current shipments.andP;  With TI reportinglower sales in this year's first quarter, Motorola now looks like a safe betto forge substantially ahead of its Dallas rival this year and next.andO;(Analyst Dan Klesken of Prudential-Bache, whose numbers we are using for thecomparison chart on this page, slightly reduces the semiconductor revenuetotals reported by Motorola by adjusting for internal transfers.)andM;Surprise, surpriseandM;We don't want to read too much into those impressive first-quarterstatistics.andP;  Skeptics think Motorola may have stolen some business from thesecond quarter, and even Mr. Norling warns that the semiconductor businesshas developed a front-end-loaded seasonality in the last few years.andP;  Goodfirst quarters, he points out, are usually followed by soft second halfs.andO;Still, we think it is safe to say that for Motorola Semiconductor, 1990 isstarting off as a surprisingly good year.andM;Surprising because the growth we've observed so far in an otherwise flatindustry is concentrated in areas where Motorola is not strong.andP;  The 386 andits associated circuitry are surging; certain types of memories, especiallythose fast enough to keep up with the higher-speed versions of the 386, aretagging along; field-programmable logic devices and otherapplication-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are also hot.andM;Motorola is not selling 386s.andP;  It is growing but still small in static randomaccess memories (SRAMs).andP;  Its strength in ASICs remains in high-speed bipolardevices, not in the more dynamic markets for CMOS gate arrays and PLDs.andP;  Byrights, it should be suffering too.andM;Avoiding troubleandM;In part, Motorola looks good because of some other lines it is not big in.andO;TI has been hurt recently in standard logic, the medium-scale devices thatare being rapidly displaced by ASICs, as well as in Dynamic RAMs, whereprices deteriorated last year.andP;  Motorola is only half TI's size in standardlogic and is keeping a very low profile in DRAMs following its exit from thebusiness in 1985 and subsequent small-scale reentry.andM;Most important, Motorola seems to be proving in semiconductors a point IBMhas made in computers: Product breadth, strong marketing and manufacturing,and customer diversity can overcome many shortcomings.andP;  Like IBM, Motorolaoften comes late to an opportunity.andP;  And like IBM, it is all but impossibleto dislodge once it has entered a market.andM;As the chart on Page Four shows, Motorola has built significant positions infour major semiconductor product segments and distributes its customersevenly across the industrial landscape.andP;  That kind of balance limits growthwhen one product family or market takes off but also provides a cushion whenthey fall.andP;  Product breadth has another important payoff: As cost-consciouscustomers strive to reduce the number of suppliers they work with, a bigportfolio helps Motorola to stay on their lists.andM;Back to basicsandM;Not incidentally, Motorola has figured out how to make and sellsemiconductors at world class levels.andP;  Corporate programs to improve qualityworked well enough to win the first Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awardin 1988.andP;  Customer service seems to be above average as well.andP;  CharlieClough, president of electronics distributor Wyle Laboratories, reports thatMotorola is the only semiconductor vendor so far to meet Wyle's target ofdelivering 95% of its orders on time.andM;This reputation is helping Motorola Semiconductor build its business abroad,where the best opportunities for growth now lie.andP;  Except in Japan, where TIhas been deeply entrenched for years, Motorola is usually the leadingnon-local chip supplier in foreign markets.andP;  In Europe, the fact thatMotorola makes more than half its semiconductors on that side of the Atlanticgives it an edge as 1992 approaches and companies scramble to raise theEuropean content of their products.andM;A business like no otherandM;In all of these matters, Motorola continues to sound like a chip version ofIBM.andP;  But the analogy shouldn't be carried too far.andP;  Semiconductor customersarenht computer customers.andP;  As American DRAM suppliers discovered in theearly 1980s, customer loyalty doesn't mean much in this business whencompetitors offering higher quality or lower prices appear.andP;  Most important,the ability to lead in production processes and product designs still mattersmore in this business than in any other.andP;  The question is whether Motorola'sproduct strategy can again lay the groundwork for success as it did a decadeago.andM;To a large extent, Motorola's stature in semiconductors today is traceable toits design successes of the 1970s -- the 8-bit 6800 microprocessor and thenthe 16/32-bit 68000 family, first introduced in 1979.andP;  Nobody builds 8-bitcomputers anymore, but Motorola leads in microcontrollers with devices basedon the 6800.andP;  It has shipped a half-billion of them so far, and the businesscontinues to grow.andM;Acorns and oaksandM;The 68000 family also is still going strong.andP;  Thanks in large measure toSteve Jobs, who chose it for apple's Macintosh, the 68000 survived themicroprocessor wars of the early 1980s and seems likely to remain the centralprocessor for the Mac, HP's Apollo, Commodore's Amiga and dozens of otherworkstations and computers for another several years.andP;  It has also had abrilliant career as an embedded controller running laser printers,accelerating graphics displays, and otherwise laboring in the background forperhaps 20 million computer and communications systems.andM;Microprocessors and microcontrollers bring in about a quarter of MotorolaSemiconductor's revenues, according to estimates by Montgomery Securities.andO;Just as important, these are the critical components that lock customers intoa tight embrace with the supplier and drag other products with them.andM;This bright picture has been clouded by the advent of reduced instruction setcomputing and by Motorola's tardy reaction to it.andP;  RISC is beginning tosupplant complex instruction set computing designs in high-performancesystems and eventually may be the dominant approach for virtually allcomputers.andP;  But by the time Motorola's own RISC device, the 88000, made thescene, the likeliest candidates to sell large volumes of RISC-based systemshad mostly committed to a proprietary design or to the MIPS or SPARCfamilies.andM;WallflowerandM;The two leading CISC microprocessor families, Motorola's and Intel's, areboth threatened by the RISC invasion.andP;  But we think the challenge to the68000 is more immediate.andP;  It has the leading position in the high-performancearena, where RISC is strongest, and it lacks the universal base of softwarethat grew up around the Intel-based IBM PC.andM;The 68000 has lost some high-profile central processor design battles toSPARC and MIPS entries -- most notably the Sun Microsystems account.andP;  It islosing others to AMD's 29000 and Intel's i860 RISC chips in embedded control,and the SPARC and MIPS camps are also taking aim at the embedded controlopportunity.andP;  Meanwhile, Intel jumped ahead on the CISC side by getting the80486 out a good six months ahead of Motorola's 68040.andP;  According toIntegrated Circuit Engineering estimates, Motorola's share of the 32-bitmicroprocessor market dropped to 28% last year from 43% in 1987 and willprobably fall to 24% by 1994 (See the chart on this page).andM;All in the familyandM;With the arrival of the 68040, which finally started reaching customers inthe first quarter, Motorola appears to have avoided any immediate danger oflosing such major 68000 accounts as Apple and Hewlett-Packard, despite veryhigh levels of frustration at those companies with the persistent lateness ofbug-free versions of the circuit.andP;  The 68040 is advertised at 20 MIPS and 3.5megaflops, respectively 4 times and 14 times faster than the 68030.andP;  That isRISC performance, and indeed the 68040 out- RISCs some RISC chips in suchmeasures as instructions executed per clock cycle.andM;We expect new machines based on that chip to prove highly competitive with atleast the low end of the RISC competition.andP;  Steve Jobs' 68040 upgrade of theNeXT machine, if it gets out in a timely manner, should do great things forthe fortunes of both parties.andP;  Apple and Hewlett-Packard, among others, alsoseem to be firm believers in the 68040.andP;  But the 68000 designers can pushRISC concepts only so far.andM;No room on the boardandM;Superscalar techniques, in which multiple instructions are completed during asingle clock cycle, would probably require so many changes that softwarecontinuity would be lost.andP;  Motorola can push process technology to get tohigher levels of performance -- but so can the RISC folks.andP;  Mountains of68000 software will keep old customers in line for some time, but new oneswill be hard to attract.andM;The future looks even tougher for the 68000 in embedded control.andP;  AMD, whichrecently walked off with a place for the 29000 in Apple's new graphicsaccelerator, is getting a lot of design wins at the expense of the 68020.andO;The Apple deal was a unique situation that &quot;nobody should read as a decisionto walk away from Motorola,&quot; an Apple engineer tells us.andM;Still, Motorola can no longer hold onto embedded control accounts on thestrength of the customer's software investments as was possible in the dayswhen programs had to be written pains-takingly in assembly code.andP;  Today'sprograms are written in higher level languages and can be readily transportedfrom one processor to another.andP;  And until recently, Motorola lacked a cheapMIPS burner that could compete with products like the 29000.andM;History lessonandM;As in Roshomon, there are as many explanations for Motorola's slow start inRISC as there are observers of the events.andP;  Murray Goldman insists that the88000 could have been shipped much earlier but for a deliberate decision toget potential customers and software developers together beforehand to definestandards.andP;  The tradeoff for a coordinated approach, says Mr. Goldman, thegeneral manager of the Microprocessor Products Group, was time to market.andM;Sounds reasonableandM;Others who were there in the mid-1980s, when Motorola's then ace designerRoger Ross was trying to sell his RISC development project as a mainstreamprocessor, say the idea provoked heated opposition from backers of the 68000who feared the consequences of presenting two faces to customers.andP;  That, too,sounds probable.andP;  At any rate, the 88000 was finally announced in mid-1988,three years after MIPS Computer Systems shipped the first RISCmicroprocessor, and Mr. Ross departed to start Cypress Semiconductor's RISCsubsidiary.andM;By coming somewhat late to the party, Motorola was able to incorporate anumber of technical advances in its RISC processor.andP;  Stan Dahlberg, managerof open systems at Data General, says DG chose the 88000 for its RISC entryin part because the design will make it easy to build fault-tolerant andmultiprocessing versions.andP;  Multiprocessing &quot;hooks&quot; were also important forEncore Computer, which is using the 88000 to rebuild both the line ofreal-time machines acquired from Gould last year and its own multiprocessorsystems.andM;DisciplinarianandM;Of course, all the other RISC brands have strategies for fault-tolerant,multiprocessing, and superscalar versions of their chips as well.andP;  Suchtechnical issues will doubtless prove important as the second and thirdgenerations of RISC wash over us, but for now they are probably lesssignificant than the ability of the various contenders to attract software.andO;The advance work with customers produced an approach to softwarecompatibility that Motorola believes will give its customers more flexibilityin hardware implementation than, say, SPARC devotees enjoy.andP;  Customers we'vetalked with won't go that far, but they praise Motorola's discipline insetting up a binary standard early in the game and enforcing it.andM;The idea is that programs created for one 88000 machine will run on all theothers.andP;  This has helped Data General attract around 400  applications forits new line of UNIX workstations and servers, which at this point seems torepresent Motorola's best hope for volume sales of the 88000.andP;  Motorola'sComputer Group is trying to help out with an 88000-based &quot;MultiPersonalComputer,&quot; intended as a server for X Windows terminals.andP;  Altogether, thereare now 300 applications that meet Motorola's compatibility standard for88000-based computers.andM;Show horseandM;Of course, Sun alone has a big lead on the Motorola camp with something like1,700 applications and with SPARC shipments approaching an annual rate of150,000.andP;  The momentum will grow as the new sub-$5,000 SPARCstation SLC kicksin and Solbourne and Toshiba build their SPARC sales.andP;  With IBM andHewlett-Packard committed to their own RISC designs and such big players asDigital Equipment, Silicon Graphics, and Tandem Computer on the MIPS team, itseems unlikely that the 88000 can be more than a distant third, unless Appledecides on a rapid move to RISC -- a highly unlikely scenario, in ouropinion.andM;Just to keep that position, Motorola will have to look out for Intel's i860,an even later arrival on the RISC scene, which was impressive enough to causeStratus Computer to switch horses and abandon the 88000.andM;Deal another handandM;It's certainly much too early to count Motorola out of the RISC race.andO;Striking a philosophical note, Mr. Norling recalls that 17 different centralprocessor architectures were contending for the desktop a decade ago -- &quot;andit got down to two.&quot;andP;  Motorola plans to be in the RISC business for a longtime, and it has the process technology and financial resources to stay thecourse.andP;  Whether the multitudes building SPARC and MIPS chips will be able tomatch those resources is the question that Motorola executives love to ask.andO;It won't be the end of the world if the 88000 fails to become a widespreadCPU standard.andP;  The day of the single-sourced microprocessor is probablyending, which means that monopoly profits will be hard to come by in anyevent.andP;  Motorola has already annointed a second-source producer for militaryapplications of the 88000, and commercial customers would presumably demandone when higher volumes are achieved.andP;  Furthermore, processors are likely toget more specialized as application-specific techniques proliferate.andM;Coming from behindandM;To keep its industry leadership in this era, Motorola needs a good RISCprocessor but it also will have to keep strengthening its presentmicrocontroller and microprocessor lines while building up a strongerportfolio of specialized processors and ASICs.andP;  The plan seems to be to pushup on performance with the 88000 family and down on cost with the 68000, allthe while tapping those families for core elements that can slip intocustomized products.andP;  Motorola has some catching up to do if it is to makethis scenario work.andP;  In particular, it must greatly step up its presence inthe CMOS side of the ASIC business, where it claims now to have found theformula after several years of trial and error.andP;  Like the other large U.S.andO;semiconductor companies, Motorola couldn't seem to put together the rightcombination of process technology, service, and software to make it big inASICs.andM;Copying the car patternandM;On the other hand, the company has demonstrated just those skills in itsmicrocontroller business.andP;  Close ties with General Motors made it the leaderin automotive microcontrollers, and similar relationships are being builtwith Japanese consumer products companies.andP;  The same approach shouldeventually work in ASICs.andP;  Motorola is looking better in CMOS gate arrays,but it still is absent from the field-programmable market, which TI and othermajors have entered through alliances.andP;  Motorola has abandoned itsnot-invented-here philosophy to the extent of appointing a senior executiveto go looking for technology on the outside, but leading candidates likeAltera, Xilinx and Actel already seem to have their dance cards full.andM;Is anybody following?andM;One notable gap, digital signal processors, is in the process of being filledthrough internal effort.andP;  Motorola's equipment operations woke up in theearly 1980s to the fact that DSP chips were becoming essential in manyapplications and that TI dominated the business.andP;  Once prodded, the Motorolaengineers in Austin responded in 1987 with a leapfrog 24-bit product (insteadof the standard 16), which won the job of voice processing in the NeXTmachine.andP;  A follow-on 32-bit DSP chip, just announced, can handle both voiceand graphics and is being billed as a multimedia engine.andM;That positioning, apparently, is intended to slow Intel's attack on embeddedcontrol applications with the i860.andP;  At $750 for floating-point performancein the 50 megaflops range, Motorola's new product certainly isn't aimed atgeneral purpose DSP applications.andP;  Even the 24-bit device, in fact, has yetto pick up much sales volume.andP;  Motorola got less than 5% of the $270 millionDSP market last year, according to estimates by Will Strauss of ForwardConcepts.andM;Multimedia engineandM;Eventually, we expect to see these advanced DSP chips in everything fromhigh-speed modems to cellular radios and, certainly, multimedia computers.andO;The same could be said for another leapfrog effort Motorola is attempting inmicrocontrollers -- going to 32 bits at a time when even 16-bit devices arehaving trouble getting started.andP;  But for now the important thing may be thatMotorola is adding special-purpose processors -- cheap MIPS -- that it canmix and match with the rest of its portfolio.andM;Playing no-limit pokerandM;The underpinning for Motorola's product effort is a manufacturing processthat gets enough capital nourishment every year to stay with the leaders --TI and the Japanese.andP;  The stakes are incredibly high.andP;  Motorola is spending$350 million on a wafer fabrication plant in chandler, Ariz., and $500million on another fab operation in Austin.andP;  That is what it takes to getdesign rules down to a half-micron for high-volume factories.andP;  Investments ofthat magnitude underscore the importance of vertical integration, or at leastclose ties between buyers and sellers, in our view.andP;  A wrong guess on theproducts and processes to run in those plants would mean financial disaster.andO;Motorola Semiconductor has worked out an elaborate process of sharingtechnology road maps with the Motorola equipment operations, so it can bereasonably sure of at least some demand before it starts pouring concrete.andO;Of course, since intracompany sales amount to less than 10% of semiconductorproduction, Mr. Norling can't be said to run a risk-free business.andM;The high cost of exerciseandM;One way to hedge the investment risks in an advanced chip plant is to run itfirst for products requiring the most advanced processes -- like DRAMs --then convert it to less-demanding logic products.andP;  That is one reason, alongwith the insistence of some American customers, that Motorola returned tomaking DRAMs.andP;  With a market share of only a few percent, Motorola is barelyin the business.andP;  This minor position, made possible by an alliance withToshiba, is fine with Mr. Norling, who says he wants only to &quot;exercise&quot; acouple of factories and serve a few strategic customers.andP;  Advanced factoriesare also useful for making high-speed static RAMs, of course, and Motorola isa lot more interested in that market than in DRAMs.andP;  Motorola's SRAM salesabout doubled last year to $60 million, and the target is $100 million in1990.andP;  To grow at that pace, however, Motorola will have to out-inventspecialists like Integrated Device Technology and Cypress Semiconductor whilematching prices with the five Japanese companies that dominate the SRAMmarket.andM;Role modelandM;If there is a bottom line to all this, it is that Motorola's semiconductoroperation is at least as important as its equipment business.andP;  The neweconomics of the industry seem to demand at least some vertical integration,and Motorola is providing a model that seems to work for both ends of thetechnology food chain.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
