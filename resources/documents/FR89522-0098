Ginna Nuclear Power Plant;Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is consideringissuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR-18 issuedto Rochester Gas andamp; Electric Corporation (the licensee), for operationof the R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant located in Wayne County, New York.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Identification of Proposed ActionThe proposed amendment would modify the Technical Specification (TS) toreflect testing requirements for snubbers that ensure structural integrityof systems following seismic or other events initiating dynamic loads.The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated July 24, 1987 and supplemented May 4, 1988, June 21, 1988,September 16, 1988, February 16, 1989 and March 14, 1989.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed change to the TS was submitted by the licensee to incorporatethe requirements of Standard Technical Specifications (STS) for Snubbers(Generic Letter 84-13) into their plant specific Technical Specifications.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision tothe TS. The proposed revision increases testing requirements for snubbersthat ensure structural integrity of systems following seismic or otherevents initiating dynamic loads. Issuance of the amendment would imposemore indepth and additional testing of snubbers, thereby contributing tosafety. The staff has reviewed the proposed revision and has concludedthat the change does not adversely affect safety of operation, the proposedchanges do not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, nochanges are being made in the types of any effluents that may be releasedoffsite and there may be a decrease in the allowable individual or cumulativeoccupational radiation exposure due to a reduction in the number of hydraulicsnubbers that require periodic maintenance. Accordingly, the Commissionconcludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiologicalenvironmental impact not already considered in the NRC-approved Final EnvironmentalStatement (FES) November 1973, as amended June 17, 1983.With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed changeto the TS involves systems located within the restricted areas as definedin 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluentsand has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant non-radiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendment not already considered in the NRC-approvedFES November 1973, as amended June 17, 1983.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve conflicts regarding resources and in any eventdoes not concern resources not considered in the FES November 1973, asamended June 17, 1983, for the R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated July 24, 1987 and supplemented on May 4, 1988, June 21,1988, and September 16, 1988, February 16, 1989 and March 14, 1989 whichare available for public inspection at the Commission's Public DocumentRoom, Gelman Building, Lower-Level 2120 L St., NW., Washington, DC andat the local public document room located in the Rochester Public Library,115 South Avenue, Rochester, New York 14610.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 16th day of May, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
