It also includesmeans for supporting the flow tube in a substantially vertical positionwith the open bottom end of the flow tube disposed in the first chamberabove the soap solution; a second closed chamber into which the opentop end of the flow tube extends and gas inlet means for introducinggas into the first chamber at a flow rate to be measured using the flowmeters.A gas exit means is included for discharging the gas introduced intothe first chamber through the second chamber. Plus there are means forgenerating a single soap bubble from the soap solution substantiallyat the bottom end of the flow tube and a relatively large opening inthe flowtube for providing an open passageway for inlet gas to pass throughthe flowtube when the bottom open end of the flowtube is covered by thesoap solution.</TEXT></DOC>
