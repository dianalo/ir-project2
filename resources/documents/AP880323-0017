Don Edwards, D-Calif., said Tuesday asthe House joined the Senate in overriding Reagan's veto of theCivil Rights Restoration Act.   Edwards, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civilrights, said the Education Department closed or suspended hundredsof sex bias cases after the court ruling.   ``Heaven knows how many thousands of complaints have not evenbeen filed,'' he said. ``We are facing an epidemic ofdiscrimination.''   Both chambers of Congress came up Tuesday with the two-thirdsmajorities needed to override Reagan's veto _ the ninth such rebuffhe has suffered since taking office. The votes were 73-24 in theSenate and 292-133 in the House.   Even as the voting occurred, Reagan was calling the bill ``apower grab'' by the federal government. But the White House laterissued a statement acknowledging the override and saying theadministration would ``work to implement the new law.''   Congress was tied in knots for four years over how to handle thehigh court ruling that only specific programs or activitiesreceiving federal aid had to comply with four major civil rightslaws protecting women, minorities, the elderly and the handicapped.   Lawmakers finally settled on a restoration act that barsdiscrimination by entire institutions, government agencies and somecorporations that receive any federal aid. If a college athleticdepartment discriminates, for example, the federal government cancut off aid to the whole school _ even if that specific departmentreceived no assistance.   Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference onCivil Rights, called the override ``a bipartisan reaffirmation ofcivil rights.'' The conference, a 185-member coalition of majorreligious organizations and groups representing labor, women,minorities and senior citizens, was the moving force behind thebill.   Education Department spokesman Michael Jackson said thedepartment had closed or narrowed more than 200 sex bias casesthrough 1986 as a result of the court decision. ``We simply don'tknow yet'' what their fate will be, he said. ``We're going to haveto assess what our responsibilities are.''   Marcia Greenberger, managing attorney of the National Women'sLaw Center, urged the individuals who filed those complaints to``bring them back to the attention of the government and ask forthe protection that the country thought the law provided to themall along.''   Reagan and his congressional allies contended that the act wouldinfringe on religious liberty and expand federal control of theprivate sector. They supported a less sweeping alternative thatwould have gotten more religious schools and corporations off theregulatory hook.   But even some Republicans said they were sorry Reagan had vetoedthe bill.   Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., who has a retarded son, harkedback to earlier days when such people were relegated to ``darkcorners ... to the darkness of despair, to being a nothing inAmerica.''   ``This legislation is about your neighbor. It's about flesh andblood,'' he said. ``It says we're not going to subsidizediscrimination. We don't want to see those dark corners anymore.... We don't want to revisit the past.''   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said Reagan was the firstpresident to veto a civil rights measure since Andrew Johnson morethan 100 years ago.   A number of lawmakers, including some GOP leaders who supportedthe veto, castigated the conservative Moral Majority group forspreading what they called misinformation and distortions.   They said they had received hundreds of calls from people sayingthey had been told the bill would force their churches to employhomosexual drug addicts with AIDS as youth pastors and bar churchcontributions by Social Security recipients.   ``No bit of legislation is important enough ... to put outfalsehoods under the name of religion to the American people. Ifind if reprehensible,'' said Rep. Bill Hefner, D-N.C., a Baptistgospel singer with ties to religious communities around the country.   The restoration act says entire institutions and governmentagencies must not discriminate if any program or activity withinthem receives federal aid. Entire corporations are covered if theyprovide a public service such as health care or if the aid goes tothe business as a whole, as in the Chrysler Corp. bailout.   Jerry C. Nims, president of Moral Majority, predicted ``dire''consequences from the law and said it is likely to be ``the majorpolitical issue for evangelicals in the 1988 elections.''   ``If enough people are not voted into office to change what'soccurred, we will have entered the moral dark ages,'' Nims said.   Farmers receiving crop subsidies, people using food stamps andother individuals receiving federal assistance are not subject toregulation under the new law. An institution's refusal to performor pay for abortions will not be considered discrimination againstwomen under the law.   The Supreme Court decision applied specifically to Title IX ofthe 1972 Education Amendments barring sex discrimination infederally funded education programs. But the precedent wasinterpreted also to cover the 1964 Civil Rights Act barring racialdiscrimination in federally assisted programs; the 1973Rehabilitation Act barring discrimination against the handicappedin any program or activity receiving federal aid; and the 1975 AgeDiscrimination Act barring employment discrimination against olderpeople.</TEXT></DOC>
