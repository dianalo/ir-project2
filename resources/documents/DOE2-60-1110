<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-60-1110 </DOCNO><TEXT>Radio continuum maps at 2325 and 1644 MHz are presented for a new large-diametersupernova remnant (SNR) centred on l=279/sup 0/.0, b=+1/sup 0/.1. Theangular diameter of the SNR shell is 1/sup 0/.6, and the estimated lineardiameter is 84 pc. These new observations are compared with other radioand optical data. It would appear that no optical emission has been detectedwhich is associated with the radio source.</TEXT></DOC>
