It was packed with powerful explosives made in Czechoslovakiaand rigged with a timing device set at 11:20 a.m., but the timerhad not been connected, the Spanish officials said. The white FordFiesta was in a parking lot at Marbella, about 50 miles up thecoast from this British colony.   British officials in London said the Irish Republican Armymembers, who were unarmed when commandos killed them Sunday, hadplanned to detonate a car bomb Tuesday during the 20-minutechanging of the guard ceremony at the governor's residence. Theceremony began at 11 a.m.   The Royal Anglian Regiment now guards The Convent, as theresidence is called. The regiment was just transferred fromNorthern Ireland, where guerrillas of the mainly Roman Catholic IRAhave been fighting since 1969 to oust the British and unite theprovince with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic.Protestants outnumber Catholics about 3-2 in the province.   Soldiers patrolled Convent Square on Tuesday and the ceremonywent on as scheduled.   All three of the IRA members were from west Belfast in NorthernIreland.   In Catholic west Belfast, protesters outraged at the killingsbattled police and British troops throughout the day Tuesday. Atleast two people were injured.   Police in Northern Ireland also reported a 1,600-pound explosivedevice was found in a hedge near the Killeen customs post betweenNewry and the town of Dundalk in the Irish Republic and was defused.   Bands of youths in west Belfast hurled gasoline bombs and rocksat security forces, hijacked vehicles and burned them, set fire toa lumber yard and erected barricades.   They scattered as police and soldiers fired plastic bullets, butquicly reorganized.   Belfast police said a man's face was burned when his car was setafire and a woman was treated at a hospital for injuries sufferedwhen her car was stoned.   Prime Minister Charles Haughey of the Irish Republic held aspecial Cabinet meeting. He told Parliament later his governmentrecognized Britain's right to take reasonable measures againstterrorism, but added:   ``We are greatly perturbed at the shooting dead of three unarmedIrish people in circumstances where it appears from reports thatthey could have been arrested by the security forces. The lawshouldn't operate like that.''   Witnesses to the shootings said men in civilian clothes,believed to be members of the Special Air Services anti-terroristforce, jumped from a car and opened fire on two men and a womenwalking down the avenue leading to the border between Gibraltar andSpain.   Two cars connected with the dead IRA members were found inGibraltar. Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary, saidMonday a third car was believed to be involved.   He said it was not true, as earlier official reports had said,that a car the IRA members parked near the governor's residenceSunday was packed with explosives.   Howe said a ``dreadful terrorist act'' was averted when thecommandos killed the IRA members.   Agustin Valladolid, spokesman for Spanish State Security inMadrid, said the white Ford was found in the Sun Parking Lot inMarbella at about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday.   He said it was left in the lot Sunday, but there had been nodanger of an explosion. Valladolid said police had stepped up theirsearch for a fourth member of the IRA team.   The IRA identified the three people killed as Mairead Farrell,31; Daniel McCann, 30, and Sean Savage, 24. Although unarmed, theywere ``on active service,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
