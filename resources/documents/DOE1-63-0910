This study was undertaken on the premise that a view of the implicationsfor the future will lead to a more optimistic prospect for Canada. Severalscenarios are considered as an aid to future policy making. It is consideredthat it will be necessary to look to renewable energy sources to contributea larger share of the energy used in Canada. This signals the possibilitythat a less wasteful and hopefully more environmentally appropriate patternof development may emerge in response to the changing energy situation.By adopting an improvement of the ratio of useful work performed to thetotal non-renewable energy expended as a major objective, Canadian societycould maintain its viablility without undue sacrifice. For example, Canadacould cover part of the anticipated energy shortfall by widespread conservation,extensive construction, and/or massive and expensive energy imports.If the current rate of increase in energy demands could be reduced throughconservation measures by one per cent per annum, a saving of 150,000barrels of oil per day would accrue by 1990. Two of the alternativesnoted above would result either in an enormous commitment of capitalresources and/or a major adverse trade balance. As a consequence, theyhave prophetic significance for future Canadian economic growth, socialflexibility, and individual freedom. 111 refs., 6 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
