The delay agreed to by the railroad and the United Transportation Union will give Congress a chance to take final action today on a bill reinstating a government-ordered cooling off period in the long-running labor dispute. That action is likely to be taken by this afternoon, reinstating the crew members and ending the expected short strike.    The Senate has already passed the bill, and the House is expected to approve it soon after the crewmen are fired and the strike begins. President Reagan is expected to sign the measure. The cooling off period, ordered as part of Mr. Reagan's naming of a presidential emergency board in April to try to resolve the issue, expired today. It would be renewed for another 36 days under the bill offered by Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.).    A spokesman for Rep. Terry Bruce (D., Ill.), said Chicago-based CNW and the UTU had agreed to postpone their actions. He also said that if the dispute can't be settled by the end of the new cooling off period, Messrs. Simon and Bruce would sponsor legislation to enact the emergency board's recommended solution. The railroad company this week offered to accept the board's compromise plan to keep some brakemen on freight trains while trimming crew size to three from four on most of those trains of CNW's Chicago andamp; North Western Transportation unit.    CNW has wanted for some time to cut the freight crews to two people, for a saving of about $53 million a year, which its planned firings today would accomplish.    The UTU has insisted that reduced crews wouldn't be safe. The impending strike has threatened to halt daily commuter rail service for about 41,000 people. CNW has said that management personnel would keep most of the freight trains running. </TEXT></DOC>
