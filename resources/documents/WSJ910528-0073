Vermont's Sen. Patrick Leahy and other Democrats haverevived legislation intended to break what they call the&quot;circle of poison&quot; by banning the export of pesticides thatare either banned or unregistered for farm use in thiscountry. Residues from these pesticides, including somesuspected carcinogens, sometimes return to the U.S. inimported fruits, vegetables, beef and dairy products.   At issue are products made by such companies as Monsanto,Dow Chemical, FMC and Velsicol Chemical. Stakes are high forthe manufacturers: Sales of the pesticides total $2.2 billiona year. They're also high for the public: The U.S. importsabout 34 billion pounds of fruits and vegetables annually,one-fourth of its total consumption. The Food and DrugAdministration inspects only a tiny fraction of the imports,but government inspectors have found about 5% to be taintedwith pesticides. For imported carrots, pineapples, rice, peasand pears, the FDA says contamination rates can besignificantly worse.   But the industry, which managed to defeat a weaker measurelast year with last-minute help from the Bush administration,is sharpening its arguments. Manufacturers raise theprospects of U.S. jobs being lost and factories beingrelocated abroad. A better solution, they contend, is tougherscreening by FDA inspectors. Jay J. Vroom, president of theNational Agricultural Chemicals Association, says banning theexport of unregistered U.S. pesticides won't prevent farmersoverseas from &quot;using the same pesticides produced in andpurchased from other countries.&quot;   For example, Monsanto exports acetochlor for use on corn,soybeans and potatoes that are generally consumed where theyare grown. But European and Asian companies make the sameproduct and sell it to farmers in Eastern Europe, who use iton other crops, including cauliflower and apples, imported bythe U.S.                                                                                                          Screening Workers Early   For Beryllium Disease                                                                                                          RESEARCHERS in Denver are studying a chronic lung diseaseamong workers exposed to the metal beryllium.   The metal and its alloys are used increasingly in suchhigh-technology industries as computers, electronics,aerospace and atomic energy. About 800,000 Americans work inplants where jobs may put them in contact with beryllium dustor fumes. Kathleen Kreiss, who heads the occupationalmedicine division at the National Jewish Center forImmunology and Respiratory Medicine, says workers who inhalethe dust or fumes may develop chronic beryllium disease,which can be disabling or fatal.   In a four-year project supported by the NationalInstitutes of Health, scientists at the center have beenevaluating about 1,000 workers at a large industrial site.The team's research shows the disease is triggered by animmune-system response.   The researchers have adapted a blood test for allergicreactions to beryllium to screen workers for early detectionof the disease before it shows up on X-rays or in chroniccoughing. Says Dr. Kreiss, &quot;We have a chance of identifyingmild disease before it gets worse.&quot;                                                                                                          Attractive Land Parcels   Gain a Powerful Ally                                                                                                          LAND TRUSTS are becoming an increasingly popular andpowerful instrument for restricting or slowing development.   About a third of the estimated 900 land trustsincorporated in the U.S. were started in the past six years.About 250 operate in metropolitan areas. The efforts nowaffect more than 2.7 million acres in 48 states, from JacksonHole, Wyo., to New Jersey suburbs.   These trusts have devised creative ways to save attractiveparcels of land. Many programs include restrictions againstshopping centers or golf courses, for example, that areattached to deeds and remain legally binding, even afterproperties change hands. By agreeing to restrict future useand thus limit market value, owners often qualify for taxcredits or deductions.   Most trusts are local and privately financed, but stateand county government agencies have become more activerecently. Rhode Island has budgeted $147 million foropen-space and park purchases. Dade County, Fla., will spend$100 million.   Trust for Public Land in San Francisco and Land TrustAlliance in Alexandria, Va., offer training programs forgrass-roots groups that emphasize legal strategies andorganizing techniques. American Farmland Trust in Washingtonprovides technical assistance in farm communities.   This year, governors of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire andNew York are seeking federal help in promoting a plan toprotect some 26 million acres of mostly contiguous woodlands.Their proposal to create a Northern Forest Land ConservationFund is intended to maintain current land uses, includinglogging, but would sharply reduce pressures of resortdevelopment.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          EMPLOYEES of York County, Va., and Virginia Power played athree-inning softball game earlier this month on a formerSuperfund site to celebrate its conversion into a 31-acrepark. The five-year cleanup project to remove coal and cokefly ash cost the utility $10 million. . . . Bell Atlantic'sBell of Pennsylvania unit recently introduced a game called&quot;Cut the Trash&quot; to encourage children and their families torecycle their outdated phone directories. The centerpiece ofthe board game is a dump. If players allow it to overflow,everyone loses.</TEXT></DOC>
