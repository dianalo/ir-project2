The same thing that also attracts Patti LaBelle and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir: the bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution. Dress is black tie, and Walter Cronkite is master of ceremonies.    Saturday, Sept. 19, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on HBO (repeated Sept. 23 and 27, and dates in October): &quot;On Location: The Roseanne Barr Show.&quot; First she was a plump Jewish girl growing up in Salt Lake City, then she was a housewife in Colorado, then she became a cocktail waitress whose salty ripostes to her customers led to a career in stand-up comedy. Catch the funny woman who played Rodney Dangerfield's wife in a recent HBO special, now in her own.    Sunday, Sept. 20, 8-10:30 p.m. EDT, on HBO (repeated on subsequent dates to be announced) &quot;Mandela.&quot; A lot of talent has gone into this dramatization of the life of South African black leader Nelson Mandela and his wife, Winnie. Danny Glover (&quot;The Color Purple&quot;) and Alfre Woodard (&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;) star as the Mandelas, directed by Philip Saville and with a script by Ronald Harwood, a native South African who wrote &quot;The Dresser.&quot; But the result is less than impressive, due to excessive caution on all sides about dealing with the thornier political aspects of the story. For a full review, see Monday's column.    Sunday, Sept. 20, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: &quot;The Highwayman.&quot; Do you like &quot;L.A. Law&quot;? Here's your first of three opportunities to see its stars in made-for-TV movies. This one features Jimmy Smits along with G. Gordon Liddy in an 18-wheel-truck smasher.    Tuesday, Sept. 22, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: &quot;Angel in Green.&quot; Another, uh . . . vehicle for an &quot;L.A. Law&quot; headliner -- Susan Dey -- in a contrived-sounding story about a nun on a South Pacific island who is rescued and charmed by a Special Forces captain played by Bruce Boxleitner.    Tuesday, Sept. 22, 9-10 p.m. and 10 p.m-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS (repeated Sept. 23 and Sept. 24. PBS air dates and times vary, so check local listings): &quot;We The People.&quot; Funded largely by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., produced by KQED-TV/San Francisco, and developed with the help of the American Bar Association, this four-part series explores various constitutional issues on the grass-roots level. The first deals with freedom of expression and religion, the second with equality, the third with law enforcement vs. individual rights, the fourth with the separation of powers. Peter Jennings hosts.    Tuesday, Sept. 22, Wednesday, Oct. 14, and Wednesday, Nov. 18, 11:30 p.m.-1 a.m. EDT, on ABC: Satellite TV conversations between U.S. congressional leaders and deputies of the Supreme Soviet. Pre-empting &quot;Nightline,&quot; these ABC News specials promise to be very interesting. Presumably, our congressmen will know better what they are talking about than some of the ill-informed citizens featured on previous U.S.-Soviet exchanges we've seen.    Wednesday, Sept. 23, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Banjo's Australia.&quot; Tired of &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;? Learn deeper things about life Down Under by watching this profile with readings of Australia's premier poet, Andrew &quot;Banjo&quot; Barton Paterson -- the author, among other things, of &quot;The Man From Snowy River.&quot;    Wednesday, Sept. 23, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Born Again.&quot; The media sometimes loses track of the fact that not all fundamentalist Christians are in thrall to TV evangelists. See what the small, close-knit church of the born-again revival does for a group of members in western Massachusetts. This intimate documentary is utterly sympathetic while also utterly unstinting. Quite a refreshing change from the cliches.    Friday, Sept. 25-Friday Oct. 2, scheduled news program times, on NBC: &quot;Live From China.&quot; The NBC news-gathering crew will spend a week traveling about China, and may send back some interesting tidbits.    Mondays, Sept. 28-Oct. 26, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;America By Design.&quot; We've had the tightly focused -- perhaps too tightly focused -- architectural history series, &quot;Pride of Place.&quot; Now we can look forward to a much more open, wide-ranging look at why our landscape looks the way it does. Maybe it'll even look more interesting, after we've heard and seen architectural historian Spiro Kostof's account.    Monday, Sept. 28, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: &quot;Assault and Matrimony.&quot; Thanks for waiting so patiently; here's the third &quot;L.A. Law&quot;-casted movie. It's a mystery thriller starring Hollywood's favorite married-in-real-life couple, Jill Eikenberry and Michael Tucker, as an unhappy pair trying to arrange each other's murder. Sounds like fun. </TEXT></DOC>
