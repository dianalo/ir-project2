Tufaili, a senior leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, orParty of God, was quoted as urging his followers to ``hold(hostage) all the American regime.''   Meanwhile, Lebanon's highest ranking Shiite cleric, SheikMohammed Mehdi Shamseddine, said he believed that the kidnapping offoreigners for political motives ``has reached its end.''   ``We are inclined to believe that this course of politicalaction has reached an end,'' Shamseddine told the Lebanese NewsAgency, an Arabic-language newsletter. He did not elaborate.   Shamseddine said he has never approved of kidnappings.   His remark reflects differences within Lebanon's Shiitecommunity over the abduction of foreigners.   Tufaili made his remarks in an interview published by theHezbollah-financed weekly magazine Al-Wihda Al-Islamiah, or IslamicUnity.   Hezbollah, made up of Shiites loyal to Iran's Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini, is believed to be an umbrella organization forunderground groups holding most of the nine Americans missing inLebanon.   Tufaili also charged that the United Nations Interim Force inLebanon was an ``umbrella for many of America's and the West'sspies.''   The nine-nation 5,800-strong UNIFIL has been deployed in southLebanon since March 19, 1978.   U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, chief of the 76-memberObserver Group-Lebanon attached to UNIFIL, was kidnapped near thesouthern Lebanese port city of Tyre on Feb. 17.   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, believedto be a Hezbollah-affiliated group, claimed Higgins' abduction andclaimed he was a spy. U.S. and UNIFIL officials denied the charge.   In addition to the nine Americans, 13 foreigners are missingafter being kidnapped in Lebanon. They are four Frenchmen, threeBritons, one West German, one Italian, one Irishman, one Indian andtwo unidentified foreign men.   Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East Correspondent of TheAssociated Press, is the longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon.He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
