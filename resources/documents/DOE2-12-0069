Measured are the angular distributionsof the elastically scattered neutrons, and of inelastically scatteredneutrons to the first 2/sup +/ state (Q = -1.23 MeV) and to the 3/sup-/ state (Q = -2.32 MeV). The angular distributions of the inelasticscattering were strongly forward peaked. Thus the direct reaction processis dominant in this energy range. The measured angular distributionswere analyzed in terms of the spherical optical model, the distorted-waveBorn approximation and the coupled-channel theory. The optical potentialand deformation parameters were deduced. The obtained deformation parameterswere compared with other experimental results and the relation of {beta}/subp,p'//{beta}/sub n,n'/ andgt; 1 was confirmed for the quadrupole deformation.This ratio was found to be consistent with the prediction of the schematicmodel for treatment of core-polarization. For the octupole deformation,however, this ratio was essentially unity. Isoscaler deformation parameterswere also deduced.</TEXT></DOC>
