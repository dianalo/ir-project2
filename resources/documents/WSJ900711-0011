Average yields on one-yearCDs rose to 8.19% from 8.15%, while average yields ontwo-year CDs rose to 8.32% from 8.22%, according toBanxquote.   Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, werealso up slightly. Average yields on one-year jumbo CDs roseto 7.93% from 7.88%, while five-year maturities climbed to8.23% from 8.20%.   The increase in yields on broker-sold andlarge-denomination CDs was in response to a slight rise inTreasury yields last week, said Norberto Mehl, chairman ofBanxquote. Big brokerage firms usually negotiate rates withbanks and thrifts whose CDs they sell; banks tend to adjustyields more quickly on jumbo CDs in response to changes inTreasury bill yields because they compete for the sameinsitutional money.</TEXT></DOC>
