According to your Aug. 28 article &quot;Test for TV: DodgingGulf Propaganda,&quot; Mr. Bode says that &quot;television isn'texhibiting the kind of skepticism it should.&quot; And SamDonaldson doesn't think &quot;the media has been as skeptical asit could be.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Since when was &quot;skepticism&quot; the major purpose ofjournalism? I thought the journalist's job was to report thenews, get the facts straight and let the chips fall wherethey may. If that were still today's definition of journalism(which, for a change, most network reporters are adhering to)the TV networks would not feel it necessary to present everyevening's newscast as though it were a point-counterpointproduction featuring Messrs. Bush and Hussein with equal-timeallotments.   How skeptical does one have to be in the face of Iraqitanks and troops blitzkrieging their way into Kuwait,followed by Saddam Hussein's massive roundup of the entireinternational community -- men, women and children.   I suppose it has become automatic for so-called reporterssuch as Messrs. Donaldson and Bode to try to undercutAmerican confidence in any actions taken by their government,even when taken in response to the barbaric events of thepast months.   As a youngster I listened every day to truly greatreporting during World War II by men such as Edward R.Murrow, Elmer Davis and William Shirer, none of whom tried toplant seeds of doubt as to the motives of those who led ourcountry against the Axis powers. It was their reporting thatmotivated me to go into journalism.   All that Messrs. Donaldson and Bode (and a few others, tobe sure) motivate me to do is to flip to another channel.   Sol Mosher   Annandale, Va.   ---   I've become more concerned over the media's perception ofresponsible broadcasting. In your article, Mr. Donaldson'sstatement that &quot;playing devil's advocate is the press'sproper role&quot; disturbs me. Where did he ever get the idea thatthe public is interested in his or his network's opinionduring a news broadcast? His job is to report the facts andlet the public draw its own conclusions.   In their zeal to beat each other in the ratings war, thenetworks have lost some of their objectiveness andimpartiality. I have boycotted all news broadcasting of thosenetworks and exclusively rely on CNN and C-SPAN's objectivereporting.   Michael Kenderes   Santa Maria, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
