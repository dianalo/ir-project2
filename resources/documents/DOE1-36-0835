The calculation procedure, which the model refersto, is based on the simultaneous solution of the coupled equations describingthe balance relating to forces and flows in porous media. Two applicationexamples are presented. The first concerns the analysis of subsidencevalues caused by a row of wells, through which a non-leaky artesian aquiferis exploited. The second example shows the subsidence caused by the exploitationof a water-drive gas reservoir. In order to carry out finite elementmethod analyses, a BASIC computer programme has been prepared. This programmecan work on a personal computer. The use of a personal computer in fullycoupled, finite element method problems, is the original feature of thispaper. The model, both through the easy availability of the requiredhardware, and through the complexity of the examinable structures, canbe an effective tool for studying subsidence and consolidation phenomena.</TEXT></DOC>
