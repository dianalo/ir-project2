The Canadian GasAssociation is evaluating commercially available industrial gas technologyand equipment to transfer new technolgy to the Canadian gas industry.There are many new processes available that can greatly enchance emissionsin industry. NGV (natural gas vehicles) now account for more than 18,000vehicles and 170 fueling stations. Increasing the use of natural gasin truck and bus diesels will increase consumption of natural gas andhelp justify the number and size of fueling stations, thus acceleratingmarket penetration. Natural gas transit buses have been operating successfullyin a number of cities; a five-year demonstration program is in effect.In the residential market, the move towards minimum efficiency standardsfor gas space and water heating equipment is of concern to the naturalgas industry. This opens the door for industry consultations with thefederal government to determine whether government proposed actions areconstitutional. One of the major issues facing the natural gas industryis the question of core markets and gas security of supply. New technologiesmust be searched to increase the share of the energy market.</TEXT></DOC>
