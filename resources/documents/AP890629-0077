Meanwhile, the House has drafted a constitutional amendment toforbid flag-burning and President Bush hopes to work with Republicanleaders in Congress to have a final version done as early as Friday.   House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, who launchedthe all-night session, drafted his own version of what aconstitutional amendment could look like. His would simply giveCongress the authority to ban desecration of the flag.   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday thatBush's proposal would be developed jointly with Michel and SenateMinority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.   Michel included Democrat Sonny Montgomery of Mississippi insponsoring his speech marathon, and more than a dozen lawmakers ofboth parties spoke.   Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, called the Supreme Court ruling ``abit of muddle-headed libertarianism'' by the majority, and hepredicted a constitutional amendment would pass.   The amendment proposals seek to set aside last week's rulingupholding the constitutionality of flag burning as a form ofpolitical protest.   Fitzwater had earlier said a final White House amendment would beready by the end of the day Wednesday, but later explained the newtarget by saying the GOP leaders ``wanted to be part of it.''   Fitzwater said efforts would be made to reach a consensusproposal with Republicans and Democrats who favor addressing theflag issue through a constitutional amendment.   He said it would likely follow the lines of proposals alreadyadvanced in Congress which have suggested that Congress and thestates have the power to pass laws banning flag desecration.   Fitzwater said the amendment would likely be only one to threesentences.   The outcry began last week with the Supreme Court's 5-4 decisionwhich overturned flag-desecration laws in 48 states. Both houseshave passed resolutions condemning the decision.   Gregory Johnson, whose prosecution for participating in aflag-burning protest at the 1984 Republican National Convention wasbarred by the high court's decision, told a news conference in NewYork the president should debate him on flag-burning on prime-timetelevision on the eve of the Fourth of July.   Johnson said that if the values the flag represents are sostrong, ``you should not have to resort to this kinder, gentlerchoke hold on protestors and dissenters.''   One amendment proposed in Congress by Sen. Strom Thurmond ofSouth Carolina, senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee,does not mention criminal penalties but states:   ``The Congress of the United States and the states have the powerto prohibit the desecrating, mutilating, defacing, defiling orburning of the flag of the United States.''   Meanwhile, several House members who voted against a Houseresolution condemning the Supreme Court decision said Wednesday theyacted in support of more, rather than less, freedom of expression.The resolution expressed ``profound concern'' with the ruling.   Four of the five lawmakers who voted against the non-bindingresolution said they agreed with the 5-4 court majority. The fifth,Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., refused to comment on the vote.   Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., said the resolution ``just indicatesthe hypocrisy in Congress and the nation ... We ought to preservefreedom of speech. We condemn China for executing (protesters), butevery chance we get, we vote in favor of capital punishment.''</TEXT></DOC>
