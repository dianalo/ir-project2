Braniff Airways said it would go along with Continental'sincreases, announced Thursday, in markets where the two carrierscompete. TWA and America West said they also would go along withthe higher fares, effective in late May.   United, Delta, USAir and Southwest airlines said they had notyet decided whether to join in the price increases while AmericanAirlines said it had no immediate plans to concur.   Braniff spokesman Rick Boubelik said the increases, which applyto so-called max saver fares, affect about 85 percent of theDallas-based airline's schedule.   Cities where Braniff would hold the line on fares primarilywould be in the Midwest _ like Topeka and Salinas, Kan., on flightsboth east and west, he said.   ``We do pricing for smaller commuter markets and some of thosemarkets have already gotten high and we don't think they can takeanother hike,'' he said.   The Braniff increases will affect advance-purchase tickets, willrange from $20 to $80 and will begin with those placingreservations on May 28.   ``We'll match them,'' TWA spokesman Bob Blattner said. ``But wewon't touch business fares.''   Continental said Thursday its increases ranged to $20 each way,depending on the market. The boosts would not apply to first classand full-fare coach tickets.   Continental spokesman Ned Walker said the increases were made inanticipation of the prime summer tourist season.   As an example of the new price plan for tickets bought after May26, a Continental round-trip flight from Newark to Los Angeles willincrease from $298 off-peak and $398 peak to $358 off-peak and $438peak.   ``Summer is the busiest time and this modest increase reflectsthat demand,'' Walker said.   However, one airline spokesman, speaking on the condition hewould not be identified, said while fares often increase during thesummer due to greater demand, the Continental increase was not``modest'' but was the largest he'd seen in at least seven years.He speculated it was related to the troubles of sister carrierEastern.   Eastern, crippled for a month by a strike, and Continental bothare owned by Houston-based Texas Air Corp.   ``Continental has tried to place itself as a pricing leader butit's usually in the other direction,'' the spokesman, at acompeting carrier, said. ``Now they're trying to recoup some ofthose low fares.''   At American Airlines, spokesman Jim Brown said the carrier hadno plans to immediately follow its competition.   ``We are still studying the proposal and it's likely we will notmake a decision for several days,'' Brown said.   ``We have not made any decision,'' Delta spokeswoman Jackie Tatesaid. ``We're just analyzing what happened.''</TEXT></DOC>
