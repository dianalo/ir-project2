(MTCI) to build and test an acoustically enhancedcyclone collector. The advanced cleanup device uses high-density soundto cause small particles to stick together in a 'snowball' effect. Eventuallythey become large enough to be captured by a conventional particle collectiondevice. This technique may be particularly beneficial to advanced coal-burningsystems in which presence of tiny ash particles in combustion gases cancause severe damage to the turbine blades. 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
