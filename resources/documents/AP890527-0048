He would notelaborate in response to questions about the ABC News report.   Tom Matthews, the FBI's assistant special agent in charge inAnchorage, said he could ``neither confirm nor deny the workings ofa grand jury.''   In March, FBI spokesman Bill Carter in Washington said theagency was focusing on possible felony violations of the CleanWater Act.   The FBI said its investigation into the March 24 spill of nearly11 million gallons of crude oil was continuing in cooperation witha number of agencies, among them the Coast Guard, the U.S. Fish andamp;Wildlife Service and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.   The Clean Water Act prohibits the willful or negligent dischargeof oil into navigable waters, said Carl Lautenberger, anenvironmental protection specialist for the EPA in Anchorage.   ``The whole jurisdiction for us to write regulations ... toassess penalities and fines'' is packaged in the act, he said.   ``It gives federal agencies the jurisdiction to do what theydo.''   Matthews said the FBI's investigation will be lengthy. He saidhe could not specify a time frame.   ``We're just beginning, really,'' he said.   Exxon has taken responsibility for the damage that occurred whenits tanker hit a charted reef in Prince William Sound, but hasinsisted the company was not negligent in its safety precautions.</TEXT></DOC>
