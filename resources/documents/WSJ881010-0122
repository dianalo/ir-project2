Augusto Pinochet.    The country was generally calm as the opposition sought to maintain its momentum and the regime dug in. After a brief plunge the day after the vote, the stock exchange recovered Friday and the exchange rate of Chile's currency was stable.    Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin, leader of the largest of the 16 parties that united in the victorious 'no' campaign, said the opposition would seek talks this week with the armed forces aimed at reforming the constitution and calling open presidential elections as early as next May. He stressed that the opposition doesn't regard the vote as a defeat for the armed forces, but as a rejection of the president.    The 1980 constitution drafted by the military gives President Pinochet until December 1988 to call elections and stipulates that he should hand over power in March 1990. But this timetable is widely seen as too slow following the regime's clear defeat. The moderate opposition believes a failure to get rid of Gen. Pinochet sooner could prompt a drift toward the left among some of its supporters.    Its call for talks with the military is rooted in the belief support for Gen. Pinochet will evaporate after his humiliation. &quot;There is no such thing as a dictator whose term . . . is about to end. Dictators don't . . . survive defeats,&quot; said moderate socialist Sergio Bitar. He predicted the right would look for a candidate in elections and &quot;Gen. Pinochet will have to go to make way for this process.&quot;    But, with some verbal acrobatics and selected doses of blunt force, the regime seemed determined to resist. The attempt to open discussions with the armed forces is sure to meet the initial barrier of their Prussian discipline. The army never lost a battle, and believed, at least until last week, that its mission was to deliver Chile into the next century as a developed country freed of Marxism.    Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez, who organized the regime's unsuccessful campaign, seemed determined to block any compromise. In a weekend speech to the nation, he said, &quot;the massive and overwhelming support of our compatriots has left us in a victorious position.&quot;    He supported this curious assertion with the argument that the 54.7% of the population who voted 'no' was divided among several parties, whereas the 43% who voted 'yes' was united behind Gen. Pinochet. Analysts note that both votes contain a wide spectrum of supporters who could splinter in the scheduled open presidential elections. </TEXT></DOC>
