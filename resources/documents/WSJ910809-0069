Mr. Kaifu's four-day visit is consistent with theindependent course Japan has charted in its relations withChina since the pro-democracy movement was quelled. Japan hasworried about isolating China while other countries werecriticizing Beijing's human-rights record. Japan was thefirst country to push for a resumption of loans to China byinternational institutions, and it resumed a five-year, 810billion-yen ($5.95 billion) loan package to China lastNovember.   The visit is a boost for China, as its U.S. relationscontinue to be rocky. But China may be disappointed with Mr.Kaifu's gifts: small additional flood relief and perhaps apromise of a future energy loan, but probably not the hugenew credits Beijing wants. Mr. Kaifu will bring up somesubjects China would rather not discuss, including armsexport limits and human rights.   From Beijing, Mr. Kaifu will journey to Mongolia for thefirst visit by a Japanese prime minister since the twonations established diplomatic ties in 1972.                                                                                                          POLISH CARRIER'S FLEET RENEWAL                                                                                                          The Polish airline LOT received the first of eight ATR-72planes it ordered from a French-Italian group, Atr-Avions deTransport Regional Consortium. LOT is to get three more ofthe 66-passenger, turboprop planes this year and theremaining four by the end of 1994. The aircraft have a rangeof about 1,500 miles. In moves to replace its fleet ofantiquated, fuel-guzzling Soviet planes, LOT has boughtU.S.-made long-range aircraft and is negotiating medium-rangejet purchases from U.S. and European makers.                                                                                                          TAIWAN TO DEVELOP SATELLITES                                                                                                          Taiwan plans to develop its own satellites and to launchthe first one within six years, mainly to broaden thecountry's scientific expertise. Under a newly approved $500million space program, Taiwan would have three satellitessent into orbit during the next 15 years by foreignlaunchers. The satellites will be funded and owned by thegovernment, which may eventually broaden the space program toinclude communications satellites. In Asia, only Japan, Chinaand India now make their own satellites.                                                                                                          PHILIPPINES TO CUT ENERGY PRICES                                                                                                          Heeding consumer advocates' calls after nationwideprotests, Philippine President Corazon Aquino said prices ofpetroleum and petroleum-based products such as kerosene,diesel fuel and fuel oil will be cut an average of 1.16 pesosa liter, starting Wednesday. The retail price of premiumgasoline will be 12.70 pesos (47.3 U.S. cents) a liter, down3.25 pesos, and regular gas 12 pesos, down 3 pesos.                                                                                                          EASTERN GERMANS ON SHORT SHIFTS                                                                                                          About 40% of the eastern Germans employed at companiesstill owned by the Treuhandanstalt privatization agency areshort-shift workers, putting in reduced hours or none at all.More than half of these employees are idle at least 75% ofthe time, the agency said in an interim progress report. TheTreuhand has fired 400 managers at former East Germanstate-run companies and at July 31 had sold 3,000 of its9,000 companies for 12.5 billion marks ($7.31 billion).                                                                                                          AUSTRALIAN BANKRUPTCY EVASION                                                                                                          The Australian government said it intends to crack down onbankruptcy filers who dodge their creditors by movingoverseas. The bankruptcy law is to be tightened to barbankrupts from traveling abroad unless they convince a courtthat their obligations will be met.                                                                                                          HONG KONG'S CRIME FIGHT                                                                                                          Hong Kong, long the favored base of Chinese triad gangs,unveiled proposals to combat organized crime, such as lifeimprisonment for multiple offenses and heavy sentences formoney laundering.   Police have estimated at least 100,000 people are membersof Hong Kong's triads, secret societies organized forcriminal activities including illegal gambling, drugtrafficking, prostitution, blackmail and extortion.   The government's bill doubles most penalties fortriad-linked crimes. For example, the maximum penalty formoney laundering would be a $640,000 fine and 14 years injail.   Separately, Hong Kong decided to lift its ban on importsof South African gold coins, iron and steel, effective today.The ban was imposed in 1986 as part of economic sanctionsagainst Pretoria for its apartheid policy, since dismantled.

Argentina and South Africa restored full diplomatic ties,which Buenos Aires severed five years ago to protest thewhite minority government's racial policies. . . . Brazil andSouth Korea concluded an accord on cooperation in science andtechnology. . . . India and the Soviet Union renewed a20-year defense treaty that provides for mutual assistance incase either country is attacked. India's defense forces haveused mostly Soviet-built equipment. . . . The U.S. urged anyof its citizens in the Yugoslavian republics of Croatia andSlovenia to depart and Americans elsewhere in the country toconsider leaving, as ethnic tensions and fighting couldworsen.</TEXT></DOC>
