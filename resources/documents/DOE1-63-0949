Radius-to-thickness ratio and length-to-radiusratio of the main vessel of pool-type LMFBR are estimated about 200 and0.9 thru 1.1, respectively. However, there is very little informationof plastic shear buckling strength of the geometries. The purpose ofthis paper is to describe the test results and some considerations onplastic shear buckling of short cylinders. The models have a nominaldiameter of 1000 mm, nominal length of 500 mm and 600 mm, and shell thicknessof 2.5 mm with axial temperature distribution.</TEXT></DOC>
