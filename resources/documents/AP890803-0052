DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As federal officials in Chicago announced theindictment of 46 traders on the nation's two largest commodityexchanges, a House committee wrangled over how best to eliminatefraud in the marketplace.   Legislation approved Wednesday by the Agriculture Committeewould grant permanent regulatory authority to the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission, which Congress has reauthorized on a temporarybasis every three or four years since its creation in 1974.   It also would impose restrictions on trading practices that havecome under criticism following disclosure of the federalcommodities probe.   During the daylong session, the committee approved an amendmentmaking insider trading on the commodity futures markets a felonypunishable by five years in prison and a $500,000 fine.   The panel also killed, in an 18-17 vote, an earlier amendmentoutlawing ``front running,'' whereby a broker trades for his ownaccount before taking care of customers who want to make the sametrade.   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla, chairman of the subcommittee, calledthe Chicago indictments ``a dark day for the industry. The types ofwrongdoing alleged in the indictments cast a long shadow of doubton how well the public has been protected as it participated in thefutures markets.''   But, English said, the pending legislation marks ``the dawn of anew day as well.''   The session began hours before officials in Chicago announcedindictments stemming from a 2 {-year investigation into allegedtrading fraud on the Chicago Board of Trade and the ChicagoMercantile Exchange. The charges ranged from tax fraud toracketeering.   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said traders broke the law as wellas exchange rules by arranging deals with one another before andafter the pits were open for trading.   Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, toldthe panel that the indictments were the U.S. attorney'sresponsibility. ``Our responsibility is to see that there is law onthe books'' to protect the public.   The committee later Wednesday approved on a voice votelegislation based on a bill adopted last week by the Conservation,Credit and Rural Development Subcommittee.   The bill would go to the Senate if approved by the full House. Avote by on the House floor has not been scheduled.   The bill would severely limit the practice of dual trading, inwhich floor traders can trade for themselves as well as theircustomers on the same day.   Critics say the practice, which is legal, encourages brokers totake care of themselves to the detriment of their customers. But inseveral days of testimony earlier this summer, supporters _including officials of the two Chicago exchanges _ claimed dualtrading helps ease market volatility when there are few customerorders.   The bill, sponsored by English and Rep. E. Thomas Coleman,R-Mo., would ban dual trading except in certain circumstances,including small markets with an average daily trading volume of7,000 contracts or fewer.   Contract markets also would be exempt from the dual trading banif they could prove that by later this year they would haveadequate surveillance systems and procedures so investigators couldtrack any given trade to within one minute of its conclusion.Tracking trades is known in the industry as following the audittrail.   No later than three years after the law took effect, marketswould have to be able to track trades to within 30 seconds to winthe exemption.   Amendments introduced last week by Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C.,would have made the practice of ``front running'' a felony with afine of up to $500,000 upon conviction.   In a letter to de la Garza on Tuesday, the Justice Departmentstated that front running ``is adequately addressed by exisitinglaw'' under the mail and wire fraud statutes and the amendmentsshould be dropped.   The committee eliminated Tallon's amendments on a narrow vote onthe ground that it might jeopardize the Chicago probe by callinginto question whether front running was illegal.   CFTC Chief of Staff Robert Mackay told the committee that``there is no doubt in the commission's view'' that front runningwas a crime under existing law. Changing the law now ``could indeedjeopardize ongoing investigations,'' he added.   An amendment, to raise the amount of money or collateral _ knownas the margin requirement _ investors must deposit with brokerswhen buying or selling futures contracts, was withdrawn afternumerous committee members opposed it.</TEXT></DOC>
