The cuts came as part of a larger cost-cutting effort bythe Big Board, which is reducing its staff by 18% to about1,600 employees through layoffs, early retirement andattrition.   Mr. Grasso said that the enforcement cuts should be viewedagainst the unit's recent rapid growth.&quot;The size of theenforcement staff has more than doubled over the past fouryears,&quot; Mr. Grasso said. &quot;Case production is at an all-timehigh, and the quality of cases is far better than before.&quot;The enforcement staff grew 210% from 1986 to 1990.   Other Big Board regulatory arms have also been trimmed.The market surveillance staff, which tries to spot impropertrading activity, has been reduced 7%, or 7 members; the unitthat monitors broker-dealers has been cut by 17.6%, or 44jobs. Overall, the exchange's three principal regulatory armshave shrunk 13.4% to 407 staff members.   SEC officials say they are closely watching the BigBoard's enforcement unit for any signs of weakness. &quot;Wealways take seriously reductions in enforcement staff,&quot; anSEC official said. &quot;We are aware of the NYSE cuts, we havediscussed them with the exchange, and we will continue tomonitor&quot; the enforcement unit. &quot;The cuts are not so largethat there will necessarily be a problem,&quot; the SEC officialadded.   The Big Board's enforcement staff disciplines brokeragefirms that trade on the exchange and their employees, handingdown fines, suspensions and other sanctions. The unit worksclosely with the SEC and refers serious violations, such asinsider trading cases, to the federal agency.   The cutbacks come at a time when the SEC has beendepending more on the stock exchanges both for referrals andto take action on misdeeds by exchange members. A recent lawhas given the SEC greater powers to levy fines forsecurities-law violations, a step that is likely to involvethe agency in more time-consuming litigation. As a result,the SEC is expected to rely more heavily on exchangeenforcement staffs for specific cases.   &quot;One question that's valid to pose is: Given this is thefront line of investor protection, how are staff cuts goingto affect the level of enforcement?&quot; said John H. Sturc, apartner at the law firm Gibson, Dunn andamp; Crutcher inWashington. Mr. Sturc is a former top SEC enforcementofficial who worked on some of the best-known insider tradingcases in the 1980s.   &quot;The referrals we get concerning trading problems that theexchanges see are always very helpful,&quot; said Harry Weiss, anassociate director of the SEC's enforcement division. Now,&quot;we may have to pick up matters they won't be able to do intheir enforcement group.&quot;   People familiar with the Big Board enforcement divisionsay David Doherty, the senior vice president in charge of theunit, has made great strides in enforcement since he tookcharge in December 1987. The exchange began to tacklesophisticated trading violations, and Mr. Doherty has beeneffective in working off a backlog of enforcement cases, oneperson said. During the late 1980s, enforcement was one ofthe fastest-growing divisions of the exchange.   Richard Ketchum, the SEC's chief market watcher, said theenforcement unit in the past few years has become &quot;much moreeffective than ever before.&quot;   However, with current staff cuts, it may be hard for thedivision to keep up the pace of reducing its case backlog andto speed up settlements, an individual familiar with the unitsaid. Enforcement is labor-intensive work because cases mustbe heavily documented. Settlement proceedings -- in whichfirms and individuals charged with violating exchange rulesaccept penalties -- are often long and difficult. Justyesterday, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. disclosed that ithad agreed to pay a $750,000 Big Board fine to settle afour-year-old case involving alleged abusive sales practicesat a Lehman Brothers branch office.   Meanwhile, the current stock-market rally has boostedtrading volume, and high volume typically brings more casesto the exchange's doorstep.   Mr. Grasso said the Big Board is prepared to build up itsenforcement staff again if it needs to. &quot;If we think ourselfregulatory obligation is not performing to our standards,we are prepared to add&quot;staff, he said.   He noted that the exchange's market surveillance unit,which combs through the market during trading hours, lookingfor abuses, has been enhanced by sophisticated technology inrecent years.</TEXT></DOC>
