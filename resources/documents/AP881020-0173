(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors thwarted by a judge'sruling that they cannot force a lawyer to reveal the name of aclient involved in a hit-and-run fatality ordered depositionsThursday from people with cars similar to the man's.   Several of the car owners complained that their vehicles havealready been checked and cleared by police.   The accident victim, Mark Baltes, died March 9, 1986, after whatis believed to be a white 1984 or 1985 Buick Riviera ran over himin a street where he lay after a night of drinking.   A person who claimed to be driving the car contacted attorneyBarry Krischer and demanded the lawyer not reveal his identity topolice while negotiating with authorities. Prosecutors sought toforce Krischer to give them the name, but last week a judge ruledthat attorney-client privilege protects the suspect's identity.   So prosecutors tried a different tack this week.   Nine people were ordered to give sworn statements in Palm BeachCounty State Attorney David Bludworth's office on Thursday. Sevenof them own or drive 1984 or 1985 white Buick Rivieras, the PalmBeach Post reported. Of the remaining two, one is the husband of awoman subpoenaed. The paper said the ninth person subpoenaed didnot have a white Buick Riviera registered in Palm Beach County.   Assistant State Attorney Kenneth Selvig would not say why thesedrivers were selected from the owners of 2,800 Buick Rivierasregistered in Palm Beach and Broward counties.   ``All I can say is we're continuing to pursue theinvestigation,'' he said.   Most of those subpoenaed said police have already examined theircars and determined they were not involved in the accident.   Stockbroker Jeffrey Randall said two detectives searched hiswhite Buick Riviera six weeks ago and questioned him about it.   ``I can understand the persistence,'' said Randall, of BocaRaton. ``But all of a sudden somebody turned up the heat real high,and it's starting to irritate me. I don't know if it's thepolitical thing or what.''   Selvig denied any connections between the subpoenas andBludworth's Nov. 8 re-election bid. ``This has nothing to do withthe election,'' he said.   Palm Beach hairdresser Michael Vulpio said detectives alsolooked at his vehicle. He said the front end of his car wasrepaired after an accident but that he knew nothing about theBaltes hit-and-run.   Pamela Cherry, a West Palm Beach real estate agent, wasinterviewed by police last year. Court records show officersdetermined that ``Cherry's vehicle was in no way involved in thiscase.''   Mary Sussil's 1984 Riviera was searched twice by police. Mrs.Sussil, a legal secretary, gave a statement and allowed police tosearch her car when police said it seemed to have a new grill andfresh paint.   On May 12, police eliminated her car because they found thegrill was the car's original.   ``I'm kind of mystified about the whole thing,'' said Mrs.Sussil's attorney, David Kelley. ``We've cooperated fully. ... Hercar was not involved.''</TEXT></DOC>
