Ascorbate in lowconcentrations enhanced peroxidation of lipids but inhibited it at concentrationsabove 4 mmole/liter so that it partially protected membrane lipids fromperoxidation produced by asbestos fibers. Reduced glutathione added tomicrosomes gave increased peroxidation at increased concentrations upto 20 mmol/liter. At 40 mmol/liter peroxidation was prevented. Glutathionehad no obvious effect on the level of peroxidation produced by asbestosfibers. The 105,000g supernatant cell fraction added either with or withoutglutathione gave a decrease in the amount of lipid peroxidation producedby asbestos fibers. The protective action of these reducing agents suggestsa possible use as prophylactic agents against the harmful effects ofinhaled asbestos.</TEXT></DOC>
