LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pantera's Corp. said it agreed in principle to acquire Pizza Inn Inc. for about $48 million in cash and stock.    The pact follows a management-led group's unsuccessful attempts to line up financing for a $12.50-a-share leveraged buyout of Dallas-based Pizza Inn. Pizza Inn said it will drop the buyout agreement, which its holders approved, if the investor group remains unsuccessful in arranging financing and the company gets assurances that Pantera's can finance its bid, among other things.    Terms of the agreement would give Pizza Inn shareholders two choices. Under the first option, Pantera's would buy each of Pizza Inn's 3.3 million common shares outstanding for $3 in cash and either 1.4 Pantera's shares or stock valued at $11.50, whichever is less.    Under the second option, Pantera's would pay $4 cash and one Pantera's share, which would include a nontransferable right enabling the holder to receive as much as 0.55 of a Pantera's share under certain conditions.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Pantera's closed at $9.875, up 37.5 cents. In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Pizza Inn closed at $12, unchanged.    Pantera's said the pact is subject to a definitive agreement, regulatory approvals and financing. Pizza Inn said it is still free to pursue the management-led leveraged buyout proposal. Pizza Inn also said the management group advised it that Lloyds Bank PLC has extended its commitment for $18 million in financing through March 31, and that the group is continuing to seek additional funding.    Pantera's, which changed its name from Concept Development Inc. last year, said the proposed acquisition would make it the fourth-largest U.S. pizza restaurant chain. Pantera's said it operates 125 restaurants and Pizza Inn has 750 units.    Last month, Pantera's acquired an option to buy more than one million Pizza Inn shares from its largest shareholder, F.J. Spillman, chairman and president. Mr. Spillman is a member of the investor group that has been trying to acquire Pizza Inn. </TEXT></DOC>
