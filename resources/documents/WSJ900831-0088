At present, European air-traffic control is a patchwork of42 centers and 22 systems with different standards andcommunications procedures. Mr. Neumeister said inefficiencyis responsible for 8% of the price of an airline ticket.   Mr. Neumeister said that although the airlines had themoney to finance the creation of a single Europeantraffic-control system, they lacked the power to implementchange without political consent from governments.                                                                                                          NO SRI LANKAN TEA FOR IRAQ                                                                                                          Sri Lanka will stop selling tea to Iraq in compliance withsanctions imposed by the United Nations as punishment forIraq's seizure of Kuwait, a cabinet minister said. &quot;We havegot clarification from the U.N. that tea cannot be anexception to the sanctions of food items to Iraq,&quot; saidPlantation Minister Ranjan Wijeratne. Sri Lanka had hopedthat it would be permitted to continue selling tea to Iraq,which last year bought 30,000 tons of Sri Lankan tea --nearly 24% of the Indian Ocean island's export crop.Bangladesh, another of Iraq's chief tea sources, barred Iraqibuyers from its tea auctions earlier in the week.   CIGARETTE-SHORTAGE CASUALTY                                                                                                          Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev dismissed one of histop ministers yesterday, blaming him for the acute shortageof cigarettes that has caused demonstrations in Moscow andother cities. Vladilen Nikitin, a first deputy prime ministerand head of the State Procurement Commission, was relieved ofhis duties one day after Mr. Gorbachev summoned him and otherofficials to demand an explanation for the shortages.                                                                                                          SINGAPORE'S FOREIGN WORKERS                                                                                                          Singapore, suffering from a severe labor shortage, said itwas relaxing restrictions on hiring foreign workers. Thegovernment now allows foreign maids and overseas workers inthe manufacturing, shipyard, hotel and construction sectors.A Labor Ministry statement said the government had decided to&quot;progressively allow other sectors of the economy also torecruit foreign workers&quot; with immediate effect. It didn'tspecify which sectors.                                                                                                          KOREAN AGREEMENT                                                                                                          North and South Korea agreed on details of talks betweentheir prime ministers scheduled for next week, a South Koreangovernment spokesman said. &quot;The two sides concluded allprocedural matters for the high-level talks to be held inSeoul from Sept. 4,&quot; the spokesman said after liaisonofficials from the two governments met in the border villageof Panmunjom. The two countries agreed to hold two rounds ofprime ministers' talks in the South Korean capital andconfirmed the itinerary for the North Korean delegates'four-day stay in Seoul.                                                                                                          PHILIPPINE PROTECTIONISM                                                                                                          Philippine President Corazon Aquino bowed to protectionistdemands and suspended her order for sweeping tariff cuts, anaction likely to undermine attempts to make the ailingPhilippine economy more competitive internationally. In anunexpected reversal, Mrs. Aquino ordered that the lowertariffs, which were to have taken effect tomorrow, be held&quot;in abeyance&quot; while the two houses of Congress try to draw upa resolution calling for a six-month delay in implementation.                                                                                                          AIDS TESTING IN ZIMBABWE                                                                                                          Life-insurance companies in Zimbabwe said AIDS-relatedclaims in that nation have tripled in the past year andannounced they would require medical tests from policyapplicants.   To sidestep local laws prohibiting selective AIDS testing,the companies increased the minimum life-policy payout to theequivalent of $40,000, the amount that allows insuranceorganizations to legally screen clients for AIDS. &quot;We had toraise the sum because so many policyholders are dying ofAIDS,&quot; industry spokesman Nalin Kapadia said.   At least 9,000 people have AIDS in Zimbabwe, and about466,000 are estimated to be carriers of the virus that causesthe disease.   The insurers' announcement was rare in Africa, where fewgovernments have admitted the full extent of the AIDSepidemic in their countries.
