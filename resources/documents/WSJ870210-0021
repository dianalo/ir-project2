GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTAEROSPACE (ARO)CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration is considering a new round of arms sales to Jordan and Saudi Arabia, in the face of mounting congressional concern over such sales.    A State Department spokesman said the sales would include a purchase by Saudi Arabia of 13 Blackhawk helicopters, made by the Sikorsky Aircraft division of United Technologies Corp., and 15 Scout helicopters made by Textron Inc.'s Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. unit. Secretary of State George Shultz discussed the matter privately with a small group of senators last week.    The administration also is considering selling the Saudis certain electronic equipment to upgrade their Northrop Corp. F-5 and McDonnell Douglas Corp. F-15 jet fighters, according to congressional sources. In addition, the administration is considering providing Jordan with equipment to convert its stationary Hawk antiaircraft missiles, made by Raytheon Co., into mobile units.    A State Department spokesman said a decision hasn't been made on these other items.    Such sales would be relatively modest, but some members of Congress are concerned that they may mark the beginning of a stream of arms offerings by the administration. These legislators worry that the administration may plan to use such sales to repair its damaged credibility among moderate Arab states in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal.    Last week, 11 members of the House wrote to Mr. Shultz to criticize such sales. The members asked why &quot;the administration must use arms sales instead of diplomacy as the principal instrument of Middle East policy, when such sales in the past have had negligible results&quot; in gaining Arab states' cooperation in pursuing the peace process. The legislators, who are strong supporters of Israel, called the sales a &quot;piecemeal approach&quot; to advancing U.S. interests in the region.    The administration notified Congress last month that it plans to sell Saudi Arabia 200 Bradley Fighting Vehicles made by FMC Corp., and that it intends to sell Bahrain some General Dynamics Corp. F-16 aircraft.    Congress has 50 days from the time of notification to block most foreign arms sales. So far, pro-Israel congressmen haven't criticized the sales, but last week's letter to Mr. Shultz contained a veiled threat on what might happen if the administration doesn't consult with Congress before pursuing other sales.    &quot;In the absence of a coherent policy and meaningful consultations, a legislative response might be needed,&quot; the letter said. Rep. Mel Levine (D., Calif.), a signer of the letter, yesterday said: &quot;We just feel we don't understand clearly enough what the basis of these sales is.&quot;    The administration's previous two efforts to make major arms sales to moderate Arab states met with fierce congressional resistance. Last May, Congress rejected a $354 million arms package to Saudi Arabia, and the White House was able to push through the sale only after the Saudis were forced to remove Stinger antiaircraft missiles from the package.    Yesterday, one legislator said scornfully that the White House last year justified the need for the sale by citing the threat Iran posed to the region -- at a time when the administration was secretly selling arms to Tehran.    Last year, the administration also was forced to pull back a proposed $1.9 billion arms sale to Jordan because of congressional opposition. The rejected package included Hawk missiles, as well as 40 fighter aircraft, 300 air-to-air missiles and 72 Stingers. </TEXT></DOC>
