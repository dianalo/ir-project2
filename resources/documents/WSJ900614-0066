Dixon, a keyfigure in the influence-peddling scandal that helped toppleHouse Speaker Jim Wright, was indicted on charges thatinclude illegal political contributions.   Mr. Dixon, who owned the now-defunct Vernon Savings andamp; LoanAssociation, is also charged with directing the use of Vernonfunds to pay for junkets, including &quot;female companionship,&quot;for thrift executives and the then-commissioner of the TexasSavings and Loan Department.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Dixon acquired Vernon in July 1982 and just two yearslater was wrangling with federal thrift regulators who wantedto limit the thrift's real-estate lending and explosivegrowth. Mr. Dixon was among the Texas thrift operators whosought the help of Mr. Wright and other congressmen, askingthem to intervene with the regulators.   Ten of the 38 counts in the indictment, which was handedup by a federal grand jury in Dallas, charge Mr. Dixon withmaking false entries in Vernon's books to cover upreimbursements to employees for their politicalcontributions.   Among the politicians who received contributions fromVernon employees, according to the indictment, were formerHouse Majority Whip Tony Coelho of California; former U.S.Rep. Jack Kemp, now secretary of the U.S. Department ofHousing and Urban Development; and current U.S. Rep. MartinFrost of Texas.   Also receiving contributions from Vernon employees was Mr.Wright, who resigned his congressional seat just over a yearago after a lengthy inquiry into his personal and campaignfinances.   The U.S. Justice Department said in a statement that thepoliticians weren't aware of the improper campaigncontributions, and &quot;there is no evidence that illegal orimproper activity was engaged in by the receiving individualsor campaigns.&quot;   The former Texas Savings and Loan Commissioner, L. LintonBowman III, who isn't accused of wrongdoing, declined tocomment on the charges that Mr. Dixon used thrift funds topay the commissioner's way on trips to San Diego, SanFrancisco and Kansas.   The indictment caps a 3 1/2-year investigation by theJustice Department, which has been criticized in Congress forits slowness in bringing criminal charges against the peoplebelieved most responsible for the multibillion-dollar lossesin Texas thrifts.   In apparent response to that criticism, U.S. AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh released a statement with Mr. Dixon'sindictment lauding &quot;the hard work of our tough, persistentinvestigators and prosecutors.&quot;   &quot;These complicated, white-collar crime cases take time todevelop, but the Justice Department is committed to theinvestigation, prosecution and incarceration of those whoripped off our financial institutions and have left thetaxpayers of the United States holding the bag,&quot; Mr.Thornburgh said in the statement.   When Vernon was taken over by federal thrift regulators in1987, as much as 96% of its $1.2 billion-plus loan portfoliowas in default. The institution had wracked up millions ofdollars in losses through loans for speculative real estatedevelopments, many of them to friends of Mr. Dixon and otherTexas thrift owners.   But the indictment against Mr. Dixon is only tangentiallyrelated to the massive, fraudulent loans that helped bringabout Vernon's demise. Instead, prosecutors focused on thesorts of charges that are comparatively easy for juries tounderstand: illegal reimbursements for campaign contributionsand junkets and the diversion of loan proceeds to pay for Mr.Dixon's California beach home.   Prosecutors have used similar charges to win convictionsagainst some of Vernon's former top officers, including thethrift's ex-president, Pat G. King.   Because juries have shown a willingness to convict on suchcharges in the past, Mr. Dixon's attorney, William M.Ravkind, said the charges against his client will bedifficult to defend against. &quot;I don't know how we're going towin this one,&quot; Mr. Ravkind said.   Mr. Dixon, if convicted of all the charges, would face amaximum sentence of 190 years in federal prison and a fine ofas much as $9.5 million. Mr. Dixon is scheduled to surrenderto the Federal Bureau of Investigation today, and a date forhis first court appearance will be set at that time.</TEXT></DOC>
