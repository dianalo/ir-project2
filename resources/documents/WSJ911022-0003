A federal appeals panel in New Orleans soundly rejected a1989 regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency thataimed to eliminate almost all remaining uses of asbestos inthe U.S. by 1997.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling reopens a debate over the high costs ofeliminating the last uses of the fibrous natural material,which is blamed for 3,000 to 12,000 deaths annually. Largelybecause of the higher costs of substitutes, the regulationswere expected to cost the industry and consumers $460 millionto $800 million.   The decision is for now a boon to U.S. companies thatstill manufacture replacement brakes, asbestos-cement pipeand construction materials such as asbestos coatings,shingles and paper products. Another beneficiary is Canada,the second-largest producer of asbestos after the SovietUnion, which protested the EPA regulation for banning itsasbestos exports to the U.S.   Asbestos use has been sharply curtailed since the 1970safter its harmful health effects were discovered. The EPAadopted its sweeping ban on most remaining products toprevent an estimated 200 more cancer deaths over a 13-yearperiod, primarily among workers exposed to fibers from suchitems as worn brake shoes and asbestos-cement pipes.   The appeals court, though, concluded, &quot;The EPA haspresented insufficient evidence to justify its asbestos ban,&quot;which the agency had worked on for 10 years.   The court didn't challenge the EPA's scientific basis thatasbestos poses a health risk; the mineral is blamed for lungcancer and other incurable respiratory diseases among minersand insulation workers. But it ruled the EPA didn't prove itscase that asbestos products still on the market poseunreasonable risks and faulted the agency for failing toconsider less economically burdensome steps to reduce healthrisks from the asbestos products, short of a total ban.   &quot;The opinion doesn't vindicate asbestos,&quot; said LindaFisher, EPA assistant administrator. She said the agency isconsidering whether to appeal the ruling, to beef up itsanalysis to satisfy shortcomings cited by the appeals courtor to revamp its regulation.   But the ruling, providing rare good news for the asbestosindustry, renewed manufacturers' hopes that a total ban canbe avoided in favor of tougher workplace and installationrestrictions that would keep the products on the market.   A portion of the asbestos ban is already in effect, butthe ruling comes in time to temporarily stave off a 1993 banon asbestos friction products, including brakes on new cars,and most industrial gaskets. The last batch of products wouldbe banned by 1996, with distribution illegal after 1997, andincludes replacement brakes, asbestos-cement pipe used mainlyfor water and sewer lines, coatings, paper products andshingle.   The court also bolstered the industry's stance that thecosts of banning certain products are excessive compared withthe health benefits. It singled out estimates that banningasbestos pipe will save three lives over 13 years, at a costof about $128 million to $227 million, or about $43 millionto $76 million for each life saved.   &quot;EPA, in its zeal to ban any and all asbestos products,basically ignored the cost side&quot; of the Toxic SubstancesControl Act, which specifically requires a balancing of costsand benefits, the court wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
