SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The intense rain flooding the East Coast fromWashington to New York this week is part of an unyielding weatherpattern aided by remnants of tropical storm Allison, meteorologistsreport.   The weather pattern is unusual, the meteorologists said, butresembles patterns that flooded parts of Virginia and West Virginiafour years ago and drenched the East Coast in 1972 _ both in thewake of damaging storms.   This week's rain disrupted train service between New York andWashington, swept away a camper in North Carolina and createdgenerally miserable conditions in the region.   ``Something like this is somewhat unique because it's a slowmoving pattern ... just kind of stagnating here,'' said David Miskusof the federal Climate Analysis Center.   Intense rain drenched a relatively narrow strip from suburbanWashington to suburban New York on Wednesday, meteorologists saidThursday. From 2 to 6 inches of rain fell in most areas but 10inches or more fell in some spots, especially in northern Delaware.   ``It's not a frequent occurrence, but it happens,'' said stormspecialist Bob Case of the National Hurricane Center in CoralGables, Fla., pointing to a similar situation that caused WestVirginia's floods in 1985.   Case said tropical storm Allison isn't directly to blame for thestagnant pattern, but it has helped keep the East Coast under itswet blanket.   Allison came ashore in Texas more than a week ago, workednorthward to western Kentucky and drifted to Alabama, where Casesaid it is identified as a low pressure area. The air circulates ina counter-clockwise direction around lows.   At the same time and to the north, a high pressure center iscirculating in the opposite direction over the Atlantic Ocean,leaving the high and the low systems grinding against each otherlike two gears, said Case.   The air flows have pulled warm, moist air northward from the Gulfof Mexico, said Case.   ``The real culprit is this inundation of tropical, unstableair,'' he said.   Case said Hurricane Juan in 1985 and tropical storm Agnes in 1972left similar patterns as mementos after they had gone.   Frank Richards and Scott Kroczyksni of the National WeatherService's Office of Hydrology explained that on Tuesday night andWednesday cold air moved in above the warm tropical air betweenWashington and New York.   The cold air, which was heavier and more dense, sank down,leading to a sudden overturning of the cold and warm air. ``Once itstarted it was almost like a chain reaction,'' said Richards,explaining the deluge.   But Miskus said even some of the dramatic rainfall totalsreported in Delaware fail to compare to tropical storm records.   The most rain from one storm in a single day occurred in Alvin,Texas, in 1979 when 43 inches fell in 24 hours, he said.   The latest rain is falling on a region already softened up bystagnant weather patterns that persisted in May, leading that monthto be the wettest since 1895 in the southeast and the second wettestin the south, said Miskus.</TEXT></DOC>
