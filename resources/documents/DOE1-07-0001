<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-07-0001 </DOCNO><TEXT>Oxidation of Escherichia coli by hypochlorous acid (HOCl) or chloramine(NH{sub 2}Cl) gives rise to massive hydrolysis of cytosolic nucleotidephosphoanhydride bonds, although no immediate change occurs in eitherthe nucleotide pool size or the concentrations of extracellular end productsof AMP catabolism. Titrimetric curves of the extent of hydrolysis coincidewith curves for loss of cell viability, e.g., reduction in the adenylateenergy charge from 0.8 to 0.1-0.2 accompanies loss of 99% of the bacterialCFU. The oxidative damage caused by HOCl is irreversible within 100 msof exposure of the organism, although nucleotide phosphate bond hydrolysisrequires several minutes to reach completion. Neither HOCl nor NH{sub2}Cl reacts directly with nucleotides to hydrolyze phosphoanhydride bonds.Loss of viability is also accompanied by inhibition of induction of beta-galactosidase.The proton motive force, determined from the distribution of {sup 14}C-radiolabeledlipophilic ions, declines with incremental addition of HOCl after lossof respiratory function; severalfold more oxidant is required for thedissipation of the proton motive force than for loss of viability. Theseobservations establish a causal link between loss of metabolic energyand cellular death and indicate that the mechanisms of oxidant-inducednucleotide phosphate bond hydrolysis are indirect and that they probablyinvolve damage to the energy-transducing and transport proteins locatedin the bacterial plasma membrane.</TEXT></DOC>
