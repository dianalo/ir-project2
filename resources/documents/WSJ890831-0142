Glenn Campbell, who will begin his forced retirement this evening. In 29 years as director of the university's Hoover Institution, Mr. Campbell made it one the most important research organizations in the world. It now has a magnificent library, a $300 million endowment, and a staff that includes five Nobel Prize winners as well as notable scholars such as Thomas Sowell, Robert Conquest, Seymour Martin Lipset and many others.    Stanford is purging Mr. Campbell for two reasons. He is demanding and sometimes strident, exactly the sort of rough-edged entrepreneur who doesn't fit into a bureaucracy such as Stanford's. And Hoover's staff, of course, is more conservative than the Stanford faculty, which isn't saying much; the first 500 names in any town in America would produce individuals more conservative than Stanford's faculty.    Many of the writings emanating from Hoover strongly support free markets and strongly oppose communism, views that would have been regarded as impolite to press too hard in most faculty lounges over the past 25 years. By bagging Mr. Campbell, Stanford hopes to bring Hoover more into conformity with community standards.    Now, there are at Stanford, as at any university, good scholars who actually believe in and welcome diversity of thought. But in recent years Stanford has been overwhelmed by a coterie of mediocre academics who don't brook disagreement with their world view. It's a typical problem in academia. Moribund professors win tenure about age 35. Unable to realize the satisfactions of being either a good teacher or an original thinker, they spend their parched decades consumed with academic politics. And if their playpen happens to be a Stanford, they tirelessly press the sort of radical ideology that can make sense only in a place such as Palo Alto.    The politicized professors maintain the fiction that they are non-partisan. They want Hoover off campus. Typically, Stanford president Donald Kennedy and the Stanford Board of Trustees are more oblique. They merely want to gain control of Hoover and its abundant resources, and they hope to do so by eventually replacing Mr. Campbell with someone more congenial to what they represent.    In doing away with Mr. Campbell, they claimed they were merely upholding Stanford's mandatory retirement policy; Mr. Campbell turns 65 this year. But apparently this policy applies only to Mr. Campbell. The Board of Trustees recently gave 64-year old Richard Lyman (who, like Donald Kennedy, was a member of the Carter administration) a five-year contract to head a new international relations institute at the university. His contract was approved at the same meeting the board forced out Mr. Campbell.    What is going on here is a form of academic protectionism: An ideology that is competing poorly in the real world is trying to bar its stronger rival. This intolerance in academia today has forced many conservatives to flee to think tanks, such as the Heritage Foundation or the American Enterprise Institute. Thus like others before them, if Hoover's free-thinkers are made unwelcome at their own institution, they can move to Washington and possibly have more impact on policy.    Still, even a Stanford can't completely escape the judgment of the marketplace. Many of the donors who give money to universities support diversity of opinion, and because of its crabbed radicalism on Hoover and other issues, Stanford has experienced a decline in donor support. Perhaps, as Glenn Campbell might suggest, these donors are finding more productive uses for their intellectual and financial capital. </TEXT></DOC>
