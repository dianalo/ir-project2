Interest rates on Treasury bills, bank certificates of deposit and other money market instruments climbed as much as 0.18 percentage point and analysts said further rises are likely in the weeks ahead. Bond prices edged lower as the Treasury sold $7 billion of five-year, two-month notes.    Until yesterday, &quot;it was ambiguous what the Fed was doing,&quot; said Robert Giordano, a partner and co-director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;Now, it's almost a certainty&quot; the Fed pushed rates higher. The first hint of further credit-tightening came as the rate on federal funds, or reserves banks lend one another overnight, surged above 7 1/4% for the second consecutive day and as high as 7 3/4%. The funds rate had hovered between 7% and 7 1/8% in recent weeks.    &quot;Every day that goes by, it becomes clearer the Fed is tightening credit&quot; to restrain inflation expectations, said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving Securities Inc. The Commerce Department's report yesterday that first-quarter gross national product grew at a revised 3.9% rate, up from an initial estimate of 2.3%, &quot;was further evidence that the economy is moving toward the late stage of an expansion when inflation expectations are stronger,&quot; he added.    The funds rate now &quot;is the highest since the Oct. 19 stock market crash and it may go even higher,&quot; said James Capra, investment strategist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. Since late March, the Fed has nudged the funds rate up three times from about 6 5/8%.    &quot;We've got a real honest-to-goodness tightening on our hands,&quot; said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;The Fed now is leaving its fingerprints all over the market. That included reducing reserves in the banking system to their lowest level since before the stock market crash. Federal funds easily could remain at 7 1/2%&quot; in coming weeks, he said.    Despite the Fed's apparently strong credit stance, it may continue to encounter problems battling inflationary pressures. &quot;The economy is growing substantially above its long-run potential, which is dangerous,&quot; said John Paulus, a managing director and chief economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;By the time warning signals start flashing, you've already got a problem.&quot;    Mr. Paulus said short-term interest rates probably will rise as high as 8% before the end of the year as long-term rates reach about 10%. </TEXT></DOC>
