These temporary regulations conform to thechanges made by sections 1113 (a), (c), and (d) of the Tax Reform Act of1986 (Pub. L. 99-514) and are required by section 1141 of that Act. Thesetemporary regulations do not reflect amendments to the Internal RevenueCode made by the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-397, 98 Stat.1436, <T3>et seq.</T3>), the technical corrections to the Retirement Equity Actof 1984 (section 1898 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986), the Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-509), or section 1113(b) of theTax Reform Act 1986 (repealing section 411(d)(4), pertaining to class yearvesting), and no inferences should be drawn by reason of the fact thatan issue relating to these amendments is not addressed in these temporaryregulations. There is a need for immediate guidance so that employers maintainingqualified plans can comply by making the necessary plan amendments to conformthe plans to the new minimum vesting standards. These regulations willremain in effect until superseded by final regulations on this subject.<ITAG tagnum="84">Prior Law</ITAG>An employee plan does not qualify under section 401(a) unless it satisfiesthe minimum participation standards of section 410(a) and the minimum vestingstandards of section 411(a). In general, section 410(a) provides that aplan will not qualify if it requires, as a condition of participation inthe plan, that an employee complete a period of service with the employerbeyond the later of the date on which the employee attains age 21 or thedate on which the employee completes a year of service. An exception, however,is provided for plans providing that after not more than 3 years of serviceeach participant has a right to 100 percent of his or her accrued benefitunder the plan. In such a plan, participation may be conditioned on notmore than 3 years of service. Section 411(a) provides that a plan willnot qualify unless an employee's right to his or her accrued benefits derivedfrom employer's contributions becomes nonforfeitable (1) upon the attainmentof normal retirement age; and (2) at least as rapidly as under one of threealternative minimum vesting schedules. Section 411(a)(2) sets out the schedulesas follows: (A) 10-year cliff vesting (100 percent vesting after 10 yearsof service); (B) 5- to 15-year graded vesting (25 percent vesting after5 years of service, increasing gradually to 100 percent after 15 yearsof service); and (C) Rule of 45 (taking both age and service into accountso that an employee who has completed at least 5 years of service, andthe sum of whose age and years of service equals or exceeds 45, vests accordingto a table, but, in any event, in 50 percent after 10 years of serviceand an additional 10 percent for each additional year of service).    Section 411(a)(10)(B) provides that a plan amendment changing the plan'svesting schedule must permit all employees with at least 5 years of serviceto elect to remain under the vesting schedule in effect prior to the amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions</ITAG>Sections 1113 (a), (c), and (d) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 amended sections410(a) and 411(a). Section 410(a) was amended to provide that a plan mayrequire no more than 2 years of service with the employer as a conditionof participation in the plan if the plan provides for 100 percent vestingafter no more than 2 years. Section 411(a) was amended to provide thatan employee's right to all accrued benefits derived from employer contributionsmust become nonforfeitable at least as rapidly as under one of two alternativeschedules, changing 10-year cliff vesting to 5-year cliff vesting and changingthe 5- to 15-year graded schedule to a 3- to 7-year graded schedule. Ten-yearcliff vesting is still allowed in the case of certain employees coveredpursuant to a collective bargaining agreement and participating in a multiemployerplan. Employees who are not covered by the collective bargaining agreementare not eligible for the 10-year cliff vesting schedule, even if such employeesare in the multiemployer plan pursuant to a participation agreement thatrelates to the collective bargaining agreement. Further, section 411(a)(10)(B)was amended to provide that a plan amendment changing the plan's vestingschedule must permit employees with 3, rather than 5, years of serviceto elect to remain under the prior vesting schedule. These changes applyto all accrued benefits derived from employer contributions whether accruedbefore or after the effective date of the changes. This Treasury decisionprovides temporary regulations in conformity with these changes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Nonapplicability of Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this rule is nota major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291 and that a regulatoryimpact analysis therefore is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>A general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553for temporary regulations.

The plan does not contain theprovisions permitted by section 410(a)(5)(B) (relating to 2-year 100 percentvesting) and section 410(a)(5)(D) (relating to nonvested participants).Thereafter, he does not complete a year of service. As of January 1, 1991,in computing his period of service under the plan his service prior toDecember 31, 1990, is not required to be taken into account for purposesof section 410(a)(1) and andSection; 1.410(a)-3.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> [Reserved]</ITAG><T4>Par. 4. </T4>New andSection; 1.410 (a)-9T is added immediately afterandSection; 1.410(a)-8T to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.410(a)-9T</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Elapsed time (temporary).</ITAG>(a) [Reserved](b) [Reserved](c) <T3>Eligibility to participate_</T3>(1) [Reserved](2) <T3>Determination of one-year period of service.</T3>(i) [Reserved](ii) For purposes of section 410(a)(1)(B)(i), a ``2-year period of service''shall be deemed to be ``2 years of service.''(d) <T3>Vesting</T3>_(1) <T3>General rule.</T3>(i) [Reserved](ii) [Reserved](iii) [Reserved](iv) For purposes of determining an employee's nonforfeitable percentageof accrued benefits derived from employer contributions, a plan, aftercalculating an employee's period of service in the manner prescribed inthis paragraph, may disregard any remaining less than whole year, 12-monthor 365-day period of service. Thus, for example, if a plan provides forthe statutory three to seven year graded vesting, an employee with a period(or periods) of service which yields 3 whole year periods of service andan additional 321-day period of service is twenty percent vested in hisor her employer-derived accrued benefits (based solely on the 3 whole yearperiods of service).

(iii) For purposes of this provision, an employee is not covered pursuantto a collective bargaining agreement unless the employee is representedby a bona fide employee representative that is a party to the collectivebargaining agreement pursuant to which the multiemployer plan is maintained.Thus, for example, an employee of either the multiemployer plan or theemployee representative is not covered pursuant to the collective bargainingagreement under which the plan is maintained even if the employee is coveredpursuant to an agreement entered into by the multiemployer plan or employeerepresentative on behalf of the employee and even if all such employeescovered under the plan constitute only a de minimis percentage of the totalemployees covered under the plan.

The fact that the nonforfeitable percentage providedby the plan for years prior to the 6th year of service is greater thanthe percentage required under paragraph (c) of this section is immaterial.The plan fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of this sectioneven if it is demonstrated that the value of the vesting provided by theplan to the employees is at least equal to the value of the vesting raterequired by this paragraph.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> Plan C provides for plan participation after thecompletion of 1 year of service. The plan provides that each employee'srights to his employer-derived accrued benefits are 100 percent nonforfeitableafter 5 years of plan participation rather than service.

The plan satisfies the requirements of paragraphs(b) and (c) of this section and, because it satisfies the requirementsof at least one of such paragraphs for all of an employee's years of service,it satisfies the requirements of this section.</ITAG><T4>Par. 6.</T4> New andSection; 1.411(a)-4T is added immediately after andSection;1.411(a)-4 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.411(a)-4T</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Forfeitures, suspensions, etc. (temporary). </ITAG>(a) <T3>Nonforfeitability.</T3> Certain rights in an accrued benefit must benonforfeitable to satisfy the requirements of section 411(a). This sectiondefines the term ``nonforfeitable'' for purposes of these requirements.For purposes of section 411 and the regulations thereunder, a right toan accrued benefit is considered to be nonforfeitable at a particular timeif, at that time and thereafter, it is an unconditional right. Except asprovided by paragraph (b) of this section, a right which, at a particulartime, is conditioned under the plan upon a subsequent event, subsequentperformance, or subsequent forbearance which will cause the loss of suchright is a forfeitable right at that time. Certain adjustments to planbenefits, such as adjustments in excess of reasonable actuarial reductions,can result in rights being forfeitable. Rights which are conditioned upona sufficiency of plan assets in the event of a termination or partial terminationare considered to be forfeitable because of such condition. However, aplan does not violate the nonforfeitability requirements merely becausein the event of a termination an employee does not have any recourse towardsatisfaction of his nonforfeitable benefits from other than the plan assets,the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or a trust established and maintainedpursuant to sections 4041(c)(3)(B) (ii) or (iii) and section 4049 of ERISAwith respect to the plan. Furthermore, nonforfeitable rights are not consideredto be forfeitable by reason of the fact that they may be reduced as allowedunder sections 401(a)(5) and 401(l). To the extent that rights are notrequired to be nonforfeitable to satisfy the minimum vesting standards,or the nondiscrimination requirements of section 401(a)(4), they may beforfeited without regard to the limitations on forfeitability requiredby this section. The right of an employee to repurchase his accrued benefitfor example under section 411(a)(3)(D), is an example of a right whichis required to satisfy such standards. Accordingly, such a right is subjectto the limitations on forfeitability. Rights which are required to be prospectivelynonforfeitable under the vesting standards are nonforfeitable and may notbe forfeited until it is determined that such rights are, in fact, in excessof the vesting standards. Thus, employees have a right to vest in the accruedbenefits if they continue in employment of employers maintaining the planunless a forfeitable event recognized by section 411 occurs. For example,if a plan covered employees in Division A of Corporation X under a planutilizing a 5-year 100 percent vesting schedule, the plan could not forfeitemployees' rights on account of their moving to service in Division B ofCorporation X prior to completion of 5 years of service even though employeesare not vested at that time.(b) [Reserved] (c) <T3>Examples.</T3> The rules of this section ae illustrated by the followingexamples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> Corporation A's plan provides that an employee isfully vested in his employer-derived accrued benefit after completion of3 years of service. The plan also provides that if the employee works fora competitor he forfeits his rights in the plan. Such provision could resultin the forfeiture of an employee's rights which are required to be nonforfeitableunder section 411 and therefore the plan would not satisfy the requirementsof section 411. If the plan limited the forfeiture to employees who completedless than 5 years of service, the plan would not fail to satisfy the requirementsof section 411 because the forfeitures under this provision are limitedto rights which are in excess of the minimum required to be nonforfeitableunder section 411(a)(2)(A). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> [Reserved]</ITAG><T4>Par. 7.</T4> New andSection; 1.411(a)-8T is added immediately after andSection;1.411(a)-8 to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.411(a)-8T. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Changes in vesting schedule (temporary). </ITAG>(a) [Reserved] (b) <T3>Election of former schedule_</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>Under section 411(a)(10)(B), for plan years for whichsection 411 applies, if the vesting schedule of a plan is amended, theplan will not be treated as meeting the minimum vesting standards of section411(a)(2) unless the plan as amended provides that each participant whosenonforfeitable percentage of his accrued benefit derived from employercontributions is determined under such schedule, and who has completedat least 3 years of service with the employer, may elect, during the electionperiod, to have the nonforfeitable percentage of his accrued benefit derivedfrom employer contributions determined without regard to such amendment.Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no election need be provided forany participant whose nonforfeitable percentage under the plan, as amended,at any time cannot be less than such percentage determined without regardto such amendment. For employees not described in andSection; 1.411(a)-3T(e)(1),this section shall be applied by substituting ``5 years of service'' for``3 years of service'' where such language appears. (2) <T3>Election period.</T3> For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph,the election period under the plan must begin no later than the date theplan amendment is adopted and end no earlier than the latest of the followingdates: (i) The date which is 60 days after the day the plan amendment is adopted,(ii) The date which is 60 days after the day the plan amendment becomeseffective, or (iii) The date which is 60 days after the day the participant is issuedwritten notice of the plan amendment by the employer or plan administrator.(3) <T3>Service requirement.</T3> For purposes of subparagraph (1) of thisparagraph, a participant shall be considered to have completed 3 yearsof service if such participant has completed 3 years of service, whetheror not consecutive, without regard to the exceptions of section 411(a)(4)prior to the expiration of the election period described in subparagraph(2) of this paragraph. For the meaning of the term ``year of service'',see regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor under 29 CFR Part2530, relating to minimum standards for employee pension benefit plans.There is a need for immediate guidance with respect to the provisions containedin this Treasury decision.
