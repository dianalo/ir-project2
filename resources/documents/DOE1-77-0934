In the Coulomb phase of thismodel we demonstrate that magnetic flux can flow through uniformly, whereasin the Higgs phase two regions separate out: a type-II phase where magneticflux can penetrate only in the form of vortices, and a type-I phase wherethe magnetic flux is completely expelled. This is the relativistic analogueof the Meissner effect in superconductivity. Furthermore, we presentnumerical evidence that the Higgs region of the phase diagram diminishesas the magnetic field increases. This is the Higgs model analogue ofthe disappearance of the superconducting state in strong magnetic fields.</TEXT></DOC>
