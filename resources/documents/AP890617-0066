He said unclear methods of verificationhad flawed some previous arms control pacts and delayed negotiationand eventual Senate ratification of others.   ``Instead of treating verification as the caboose on the train,and treating it at the end or after the end, during ratificationdebates, I think that we will probably see an effort to bring thatto a higher priority and get serious movement going on things thatcould substantially advance our ability to verify this agreementwhen it is done,'' said the official, speaking on condition that henot be further identified.   President Bush has decided to make no dramatic changes in theU.S. position in the START talks, which resume in Geneva on Mondayafter a recess that began last November, his spokesman said lastweek. The treaty would eliminate 30 percent to 50 percent oflong-range superpower nuclear weapons.   Bush delayed reopening the talks pending completion of a``strategic review,'' a process that apparently yielded new ideas onverification.   ``The previous administration left an excellent foundation onwhich to build,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater toldreporters Friday, saying there would be only ``relatively minorchanges'' from the Reagan administration.   But Bush wants to take advantage of the new Soviet openness totest methods of verifying cuts in some of the long-range ballisticmissiles already agreed upon under the draft treaty, said thePentagon official.   The official declined to disclose the exact nature of thecontemplated tests, but he said they would not include one proposedby Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to verify the presence ofnuclear-tipped cruise missiles aboard submarines.   The administration has endorsed objections by the U.S. Navy toGorbachev's proposal to ban that category of missiles, an impassethat remains one of the major obstacles to completion of the treaty.   Also unresolved is a U.S. call for a ban on mobile missiles, aclass of weapon the Soviets have deployed but the United States hasnot.   Verifying numbers of mobile missiles on either side may be anunsolvable problem despite the use of satellites and on-siteinspection, said the Pentagon official, although he declined tospecify whether the new U.S. ideas attempted to resolve that issue.   ``The START process is basically a sound process. A lot has beenaccomplished in these negotiations with the Soviets. We don't wantto throw that away,'' said the Pentagon official.   ``Even on a number of elements where we have achieved asurprising degree of agreement with the Soviets, there are some verybig verification problems that we can see already,'' said theofficial.   ``Clearly, one of the areas that has been the subject of thegreatest attention is the subject of mobile ICBMs (intercontinentalballistic missiles) and what their place would be under the STARTagreement,'' said the official.   The Soviet Union has deployed two mobile missile systems,designated by the Pentagon as the SS-24 and SS-25, whereas theUnited States has not developed one. The administration has askedCongress to approve the deployment of rail-based MX missiles, with10 warheads apiece, and to fund development of the Midgetman, withone or two warheads apiece.   ``The biggest problems about mobiles are for verification and forbreakout. And until we see that solutions to those problems can befound, then there are very strong arguments in favor of continuingthe ban'' insisted on by President Reagan, the official said.   U.S. officials will propose ``actually going out and doing somethings that would give us the kind of knowledge on the basis ofwhich we could say, `Well, it turns out we can verify this thingwith greater confidence than we thought, because there are certainthings that we can observe that we didn't realize went along withthat system,'' said the official.   ``Or alternatively, we could say, `Well it turns out that what wethought would be a sufficient level of inspection isn't good enough,because when you get there, there is a problem that we hadn'tuncovered before. ...   ``We will have had the kind of experience that would allow us tosay with a great deal more confidence how good our verification isand be able to improve it before we get to the end of the treatyinstead of just having to find out afterward,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
