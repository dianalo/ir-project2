On either side of the Atlantic the almost automatic answer varieslittle: Why of course Europe will pursue an open trade policy.Doesn't everyone know that free trade _ trade without artificialbarriers _ benefits everyone?   The automatic response and the eagerness to assure, however, maybe only a veneer covering vast uncertainties. An economicallyunified Europe could be an amiable giant or, if provoked, a muscledbully protecting his turf.   In the abstract, every important trading nation professes analmost theological belief in free trade. But each also is aware ofthe benefits, however temporary, of limiting the flow of foreigngoods into its markets.   Which course will Europe take?   By the end of 1992, members of the European Economic Communityplan to remove almost all barriers to each other's trade, investmentand movement of labor, creating a common market of 320 millionpeople.   Obviously, they wouldn't do so if they didn't believe in mutualbenefits for each other. Instead of a dozen relatively weak marketsfor goods, the united market would be an economic entity comparableto the United States.   Having achieved that, will they then seek to protect their``free'' market from others? Will they restrict Japanese andAmerican access, or will they express their faith in opencompetition by leaving their market doors ajar?   While the latter seems the most likely route, the underlyinguncertainty is aroused again and again by incidents that, isolatedfrom the bigger picture, seem of far less importance.   This week in Geneva, for example, some European trade negotiatorsfelt the United States had violated the spirit of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade by threatening trade sanctionsagainst Brazil, India and Japan.   Those sanctions have not been imposed, and there is some questionabout whether Uncle Sam really intends to do anything at all aboutwhat he perceives to be unfair trade practices by these nations.   The mere threat, however, was sufficient to raise tempers _ andin trade talks, whenever tempers rise the threat of retaliation soonfollows.   A simple French television commercial, now two years old butstill replayed in the minds of wary Americans and Japanese, alsodemonstrates how close those uncertainties are to the surface.   The commercial, sponsored by the French government, showed askinny boxer faced down by a huge American football player and amassive and menacing Japanese sumo wrester.   The fate of the skinny French boxer seemed bleak, but he did notrun. No need to, because soon he was surrounded by 11 other boxerswho helped rout the huge American football player and the massiveJapanese wrestler.   In short, scratch a free-trader on either side of the Atlantic oranywhere else in the world and you might find a protectionist.   The latter might bury their sympathies for the sake of publicdecorum, but seldom do they bury them so deep that they cannot bearoused and resurrected immediately.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Friday, June 22.</NOTE></DOC>
