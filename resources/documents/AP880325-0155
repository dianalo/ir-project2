While national labor leaders are assuming Michael Dukakis willbe the eventual nominee, they are prevented from endorsing him bywhat appears to be growing rank-and-file support for Jesse Jackson,who has gotten more union votes than any of the other candidates inprimaries so far. Richard Gephardt also has considerable unionsupport.   None of the Democratic candidates appears to have won the hearts_ or votes _ of a majority of the state's 750,000 rank-and-fileunion workers, nearly half of them members of the United AutoWorkers.   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland has held out the possibility ofan endorsement before the Democratic National Convention in July ifit appears that two-thirds of the labor federation's 14.2 millionmembers have agreed on a favorite.   So far they haven't. Exit polls from the March 8 Southernprimaries showed Jackson holding the greatest support among unionmembers at 37 percent, followed by Dukakis at 25 percent.   ``There's not going to be an endorsement before the covention,''Communications Workers of America President Morton Bahr, who alsois an AFL-CIO vice president, said this week.   Despite UAW President Owen Bieber's known affection forGephardt, the union itself has carefully maintained an officialposition of neutrality in accord with AFL-CIO guidelines.   So have the other big unions in Michigan _ the Teamsters with72,000 members, the American Federation of State, County andMunicipal Employees with 60,000, the Service Employees with 27,000and the United Steel Workers with 24,000.   But that ``neutrality'' by the international unions hasn'tprevented their former leaders and the hundreds of local unionofficers in Michigan from taking sides.   Bill Marshall, former president of the Michigan state laborfederation, endorsed Gephardt on Friday. Former UAW President DougFraser endorsed Dukakis earlier this month.   ``It's kind of schizophrenic, said Jon Ogar, a spokeman for theMichigan State Labor Federation. ``Most of the unions here havepeople in everybody's camp.''   AFSCME, for example, is running separate sets ofget-out-the-vote phone banks on behalf of both Dukakis, the clearfavorite of their national leaders, and Jackson, who has theendorsement of the union's top officials in Detroit and Michigan.   Half the presidents of the 40 locals representing about 85percent of the Communications Workers of America's 20,000 membersin the state have endorsed Dukakis. But the other 20 locals appearequally divided between Jackson and Gephardt.   ``I personally came out for Gephardt but I've taken a lot ofheat for it because he supported President Reagan's tax law,'' saidRobert Shukwit, president of CWA Local 4008 in Detroit.   ``But I don't think we've seen the candidate yet,'' Shukwitadded, indicating a lingering dream among many trade unionists thatNew York Gov. Mario Cuomo might emerge as an alternative.   Meanwhile, the UAW remains the most important labor voice inMichigan. And it has taken several steps to dissociate itself fromthe endorsement its 10,000 members in Iowa gave Gephardt inFebruary.   For example, the union is running TV commercials in Michiganstressing a need for an activist government. Prior to the Iowacaucuses, it ran ads in that state focusing on the trade issueGephardt has championed.   One UAW official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, saidBieber, the union's president, probably believes Dukakis is goingto be the nominee and doesn't want to stir trouble with him.   At the same time, endorsing Dukakis would infuriate Jacksonloyalists among blacks, about 25 percent of the UAW's membership,and Arabs, a large contingent of its Ford workers in Dearborn, theofficial said.   Nonetheless, another union official predicted that Gephardt willfare much better in Saturday's caucuses than he has in polls overthe past two weeks in the state, which has lost 400,000 union jobsto imports since 1982. That official mentioned an internal pollshowing Gephardt holding a narrow lead over Jackson with Dukakis adistant third among union members.</TEXT></DOC>
