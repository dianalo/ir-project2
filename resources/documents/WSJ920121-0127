The U.S. Treasury market was closed yesterday inobservance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, a nationalholiday. But in European trading, prices of U.S. Treasurysended about 1/8 point higher as European players extendedFriday's gains in light trading.</LP><TEXT>   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late inLondon at 104 25/ 32, up 11/32 from late Friday in London toyield 7.58%. That amounts to a gain of about $3.75 for a bondwith a $1,000 face amount.   At the shorter end, the Treasurys when-issued two-year andfive-year notes, which saw a big drop in yields duringFriday's rally, were firmer again yesterday. The two-yearnote was quoted at a yield of 4.995% compared with 5.01% atFriday's close in New York. The five-year note ended at6.345%, down from 6.37% late Friday in New York.   Although the Treasury market was closed in the U.S.yesterday, the corporate bond market was open. In corporatetrading, the junk bonds of Burlington Holdings Inc. roseafter the company said it will go public as part of a plan toretire all of its costly high-yield bonds.   The move, by Burlington Industries Equity Inc., is part ofa recapitalization plan that will also involve therefinancing of some bank debt.   In response to the news, junk bonds of Burlington Holdingssoared. Burlington Industries Equity is the parent company ofBurlington Holdings.   Burlington Holdings' 14.25% subordinated debentures, duein 1999, gained three points to end at 104. Meanwhile, thecompany's zero-coupon bonds chalked up five points to end at83.   In the broader high-yield market, prices of most junkbonds, or speculative-grade bonds with low credit ratings orno credit ratings at all, ended little changed in lacklustertrading.   Activity was also quiet in the investment-grade corporatedebt market, where prices of high-grade bonds barely budged.Since many investors were absent because of the Martin LutherKing Jr. holiday, sales of new corporate bonds and notes,which had occurred at a furious pace last week, ground to ahalt.   As part of its proposed recapitalization, Burlington saidit will sell 57 million common shares at a targeted pricerange of $14 to $16 a share.   Richard Byrne, a junk bond analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.,said he thinks the common stock sale is &quot;doable.&quot; Burlington,he notes, has a lot of advantages. Not only does the companyhave strong name recognition and hold a good position in manyof its markets, but it has recently enjoyed strong financialresults.   &quot;The company looks very strong after this transactionbecause it will leave them with roughly 50% equity and 50%debt,&quot; said Mr. Byrne.   At the end of last year, Mr. Byrne said Burlington had anestimated $800 million of bank debt. In its announcementyesterday, the company said it has obtained commitments fromChemical Banking Corp.'s Chemical Bank unit, Bankers TrustNew York Corp.'s Bankers Trust Co. unit, Bank of Nova Scotiaand NationsBank Corp. for $1 billion of a proposed $1.25billion bank facility for the transaction.   In the Eurobond market yesterday, the Republic of SouthAfrica launched its expected bond issue denominated inEuropean Currency Units, and was forced to offer very highyields to lure involving investors.   South Africa tapped the market for ECU 250 million ($339.3million) of five-year securities via joint lead underwritersParibas Capital Markets Ltd. and Swiss Bank Corp. This is thesecond time in about six months that South Africa has visitedthe European capital markets. Last September it sold bondsdenominated in marks.   The latest notes were reoffered to investors at par andyielded 10.375% -- a yield that is almost two points morethan most other five-year ECU bonds available in the market.   Though investors obtained attractive yields, underwritersappear the real winners -- walking away with a total of about$6 million in fees. This is considerably more than the feeson most five-year ECU bond issues. For instance, Credit Localde France's ECU 500 million five-year issue sold earlier thismonth via Paribas gave underwriters fees in the region of$1.6 million. SBC lead managed a ECU 250 million five-yearissue for General Electric Capital Corp. last week for about$800,000 in total fees.   Underwriters justified the amount by saying South Africawas a risky credit and that selling its bonds to investorswas &quot;hard work.&quot; Underwriters also said the larger-than-usualdegree of risk involved justified the generous pricing ofSouth Africa's ECU offering. &quot;South Africa was onlyinterested in a successful deal,&quot; and was therefore willingto pay the price for it, a banker in Europe said.   In Johannesburg, sources at the South African governmentacknowledged that this was an expensive financing, and theyblamed the relatively large size of the issue and SouthAfrica's newcomer status. The proceeds will contribute towardfinancing the national budget, South Africa's FinanceDepartment said.   Part of the riskiness surrounding South African debt stemsfrom the possibility of a new government there. Last year,the secretary general of the African National Congress, CyrilRamaphosa, sent alarm bells ringing when he said the ANC maynot honor any foreign loans made to the current &quot;apartheidgovernment.&quot; ANC Press Secretary Gill Marcus said inJohannesburg yesterday that it would &quot;reject it {the bondissue} as we have the others.&quot;   Indeed, the ANC's opposition to a planned offering lastOctober by the Independent Development Trust, anon-government organization that supports community projects,forced embarrassed underwriters JP Morgan andamp; Co. to cancel theoffering.   Underwriters said they had placed the bulk of theirallocations, and that demand had been strongest from retailaccounts in Europe. There was some demand from high-yieldfunds as well, they said.   Elsewhere, activity was mostly muted. Price of mostEurobonds rose slightly in line with the underlyinggovernment markets.</TEXT></DOC>
