The Massachusetts governor did not mention Simon by name, buthis reference was unmistakable. Simon, short on cash and far behindin the chase for delegates to the Democratic National Convention,says he is running in his home state to play a role at a brokeredconvention in Atlanta.   Dukakis declined to answer directly when a reporter asked him atan early-morning news conference whether a vote for Simon was avote for a brokered convention. He replied by saying he hoped thevoters would pick the candidate they believed would make the bestDemocratic nominee.   He also said he couldn't think of ``anything worse for our partythan to go through weeks and weeks'' after the end of the primaryseason ``with speculation as to who's dealing with whom, who'snegotiating with whom.''   Dukakis told reporters he believes he has made ``significantgains'' in recent days in Illinois. Public opinion polls indicatethat Simon's support has begun to slip with another favorite son,Jesse Jackson, challenging him for the lead and with Dukakisgaining support as well.   Dukakis' aides, speaking privately, say they would be pleased ifJackson edged out Simon for a popular-vote victory, hoping thatwould persuade the senator to quit his campaign.   In the separate election for 187 delegates, Dukakis' aidesconcede he is unlikely to win more than a handful in Illinois, ifthat.   Dukakis made his comments at a news conference on a cold andwindy elevated commuter railroad station. The governor, who prideshimself on riding the subway to his statehouse office in Boston,greeted commuters and chatted with railroad employees during a20-minute train ride.   Dukakis made these same arguments on Sunday.   ``This nomination is not going to be decided by six guys sittingin a back room in Atlanta,'' he said as he polished off a day ofethnic campaigning at a fund-raiser in a Greek restaurant.   His comments were a variation on his made-for-Illinoistelevision ad which lashes out against a brokered convention.   The ad doesn't mention Paul Simon by name but the reference isclear, since the Illinois senator skipped the 21 Super Tuesdaycontests last week and says he is remaining in the race so he canparticipate in a brokered convention.   The Massachusetts governor set out on his Illinois stretch runas polls offered conflicting evidence on the race. An ABCNews-Washington Post poll published today in the newspaper gaveSimon the lead with 39 percent support, Jackson 34 percent, Dukakis17 percent.   But a Chicago Tribune poll for publication today gave Jackson 32percent support compared with 29 percent for Simon and 20 percentfor Dukakis. Those results suggested that Simon's support has begunto slip and Jackson and Dukakis have begun to edge up.   Dukakis is the leader in delegates in the Democratic nominationrace. His strategy in Illinois has been to suggest that he has thebest chance to win the nomination and a vote for the favorite sonswould lead to a brokered convention this summer.   ``Some people would like to turn back the clock, to go back tothe days when the voters didn't really pick their nominee,'' saysthe announcer in Dukakis' television commercial. ``They say youmust turn over that power to them at a brokered convention.''</TEXT></DOC>
