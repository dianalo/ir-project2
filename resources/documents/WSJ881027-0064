Bartley </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST </CO><TEXT>   The Vietnam War still haunts this year's political campaign, author Neil Sheehan has been explaining in promoting his new book. &quot;It's a terribly painful experience, and it's still with us. It's with us in this election campaign. You see Sen. Quayle in trouble because he avoided the draft and joined the National Guard, and you see Jane Fonda apologizing for going to Hanoi. It won't leave us, and I don't think it will leave us until we face the truth and come to grips with it.&quot;    Moments after these particular words were broadcast on ABC last week, the news showed a demonstration at the Pentagon against U.S. policy in El Salvador. It mentioned that among those in attendance was anti-Vietnam activist Daniel Ellsberg. For those of us who remember, the juxtaposition was poignant. Mr. Ellsberg, leaker of the Pentagon papers, and Mr. Sheehan, the recipient of the leak. Mr. Ellsberg, the 1962 cold warrior worried about &quot;another Vietnam&quot; not even in Nicaragua but in President Duarte's El Salvador. Mr. Sheehan, one of the press boosters of the 1963 coup to overthrow Ngo Dinh Diem, spending 16 years on a book to justify that ill-fated decision. Yes, the war certainly does haunt this campaign.    ---   Mr. Sheehan's book, &quot;A Bright and Shining Lie,&quot; is cast as a biography of John Paul Vann, the Ollie North of his day. Lt. Col. Vann's manic energy and reckless courage made him an extraordinarily effective warrior, first as an adviser to the Vietnamese in the Mekong Delta and later as a civilian directing regular-force battles in the highlands. The same drive led him to cut corners bureaucratically (as well as, Mr. Sheehan details, sexually). In particular, when his reports that the Vietnamese were ignoring his advice and losing the war were rejected/suppressed in the chain of command, he took them to the press. David Halberstam, Mr. Sheehan, Malcome Browne and other correspondents reported them with a vigor that set the course of American policy.    The correspondents echoing Mr. Vann may well have been right about the battlefield, though their reporting is still a source of controversy. The New York Times published an extract from Mr. Sheehan's book complaining that Times editors badgered Mr. Halberstam about contrary reports by Marguerite Higgins of the New York Herald Tribune. Nathaniel Gerstenzang, assistant foreign editor at the time, responded in a letter, &quot;Such requests are routine in cases where competing newspapers publish contradictory reports. Most competent reporters don't threaten to resign when they are asked to take account of such differences.&quot;    Whatever, two things are clear enough. First, that President Diem was overthrown and he and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu were killed because many Americans, by then including Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge and State Department officials Averell Harriman and Roger Hilsman, thought it would help the war effort. And second, after the coup the war effort quickly got worse, a lot worse. This Mr. Sheehan dismisses in essentially one sentence: &quot;The overthrow of the Ngo Dinhs came too late to save the Delta and to avert the catastrophe that Vann had feared.&quot;  st   It was rather uncharitable of Mr. Sheehan to omit from his 12-page bibliography Marguerite Higgins's 1965 book, &quot;Our Vietnam Nightmare.&quot; And perhaps publishing schedules precluded Ellen J. Hammer's &quot;A Death in November,&quot; published only last year. Ms. Hammer, who has followed Indochina since the 1950s, homes in relentlessly on the coup itself.    Some of her most arresting material comes from Robert Kennedy's oral history. After the coup, he recounted, &quot;nobody was behind it, nobody knew what we were going to do, nobody knew what our policy was.&quot; President Kennedy thought he'd made a mistake in approving the U.S. signal for a coup, his brother reported: &quot;He had passed it off too quickly over the weekend at the Cape -- he had thought it was cleared by McNamara and Taylor and everyone in State.&quot;    President Kennedy inquired only at the last moment who in Saigon would be vital to a coup. Gen. Maxwell Taylor and others argued post-coup confusion would cripple the war effort. The CIA had studied other potential leaders and found none of them more likely to succeed than Diem. The president was particularly shaken by the assassination of the Ngo brothers, which seemed to surprise him. He rebuffed the suggestion that they were tyrants: &quot;They were in a difficult position. They did the best they could for their country.&quot;    When President Diem was assassinated on Nov. 2, 1963, there were some 16,000 American troops in Vietnam. President Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, leaving the aftermath to Lyndon B. Johnson, who had counseled that overthrowing an ally was no way to win a war. The day after the Kennedy funeral, he showed Hubert Humphrey a picture of Diem. &quot;We had a hand in killing him,&quot; President Johnson said, &quot;now it's happening here.&quot;    &quot;There was the memory of Diem to haunt those of us who were aware of the circumstances of his downfall,&quot; Gen. Taylor wrote later. &quot;The realization of our role in creating the Vietnamese predicament was a strong deterrent&quot; to any proposals to withdraw. As Ms. Hammer says, &quot;The Americans were sucked into the vacuum created by Diem's violent overthrow and its aftermath.&quot;    At least John Paul Vann died still trying to win his war; many of his 1963 allies tried to expiate their own guilt by turning against the war, the Johnson administration and the American cause in general. Surely this history echoes through the 1988 presidential campaign, though largely at the expense of the Democrats. On the simple face of the matter, liberal Democratic intellectuals took us into Vietnam. That many of the same liberals hotly opposed what they had helped create was not lost on the voters; that's why they put such store in simple verities like pledging the flag.    ---   Mr. Bartley is editor of the Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
