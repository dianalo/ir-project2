This is probably a magnetohydrodynamical process of magnetic fieldstrengthening or a new magnetic flux generation. It is closely relatedto a specific singularity in the local magnetic field topology at theinner field boundary not far from the centre of the group, where thegulf of one polarity is compressed inbetween the boundary curvature ofthe field of opposite polarity and where large radial velocities maybe observed. This is the region where new peaks of both the leading andthe following polarities in a special orthogonal relation of the newto the old tubes of lines of force develop and where the greatest fieldgradients are formed. The flare frequencies and their importances correlatewell with the degree of complexity of magnetic field topology in thissituation. The important role of the photosphere in all these processesis underlined. (author). 2 figs., 30 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
