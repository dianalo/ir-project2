(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Garry Trudeauwithdrew a week of his comic strips after his gentle lampoon of thestudent protests for democracy turned tragic with the Beijingmassacres.   All last week the strip was set in Beijing's Tiananmen Square,where students had been protesting since April.   This week Trudeau zeroed in on the controversy over the recentlypublished diary of the late artist Andy Warhol, but he had plannedto take his characters back to China next week.   ``Then everything intensified over the weekend, so we killed thatweek,'' said Lee Salem, editorial director of the Kansas City-basedUniversal Press Syndicate, which distributes the strip. ``The wholesituation blew up.''   Salem said another week of strips on the China theme, for usestarting June 12, had been sent to newspapers last Friday when theweekend's events in which hundreds were killed made the cartoonsinappropriate.   Salem said the substitute strips sent out Sunday provide ``kindof an obtuse look at the Alaska oil spill.''   Trudeau told New York Newsday that the premise of the substitutestrips ``is that the artist tips an ink bottle on a whole week'sworth of strips.''   He told the newspaper that the second week of strips on China was``predicated on a peaceful resolution.''   ``That was a very bad miscalculation ... and now obviouslyinappropriate,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
