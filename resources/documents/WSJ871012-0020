Since the start of this year, MCI has just about doubled from the 6-to-7 range, aided by more favorable analyst recommendations. In over-the-counter trading Friday, MCI closed at 11 7/8, up 1/2.    &quot;'The theme on Wall Street is that there is improvement at MCI, and they'll be viable with ATandamp;T,&quot; says Robert Morris III of Prudential-Bache Capital Funding. In late August, Mr. Morris changed his MCI recommendation to &quot;buy,&quot; after calling the company a &quot;weak sell&quot; for a year.    Mr. Morris, who reiterated his upbeat assessment last week, says MCI has convinced investors it will succeed in a year-old campaign to win contracts from large commercial customers.    In September, for example, MCI beat out ATandamp;T and US Sprint Communications, a joint venture of GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications for a multimillion dollar contract to transmit all United Airlines internal voice traffic. This month, MCI received a contract from the Defense Department, announced it would expand its international direct-dialing service and reached an agreement to provide phone service between the U.S. and West Germany. The company also has joined a team headed by Martin Marietta that is competing for a share of a multibillion dollar overhaul of the entire federal government's phone system.    By itself, none of these accomplishments &quot;is all that impressive,&quot; says John Bain of Shearson Lehman Brothers. But &quot;lots of little things are going right, and that's seen as a vote of confidence from major customers.&quot; Moreover, Prudential-Bache's Mr. Morris says he has spoken with &quot;numerous&quot; corporate phone users who intend to give MCI increased business in coming months.    Only a year ago, some analysts had begun to write MCI's obituary. In the early 1980s, the company had carved its niche in the deregulated long-distance market by winning millions of residential and small-business customers shopping for low rates. But price-cutting by ATandamp;T and tough reductions imposed by the Federal Communications Commission decreased MCI's attractiveness and fueled a rate war that hurt profit.    The company's operating profit for the first six months of 1987 fell 25% to $27 million from the year-earlier period.    Central to the new bullishness on MCI is the sense that management &quot;has gained better control and knowledge over the business,&quot; says Mr. Morris. He cites a new, more experienced sales force installed to pitch major commercial contracts and to improved cost control.    As MCI expanded service in 1985 and 1986, it also saw its costs for connecting with local phone companies jump substantially. But for the first half of 1987, MCI cut operating expenses slightly compared with the 1986 period. Meanwhile, billable hours increased more than 30%.    Anticipated regulatory changes also have contributed to an improved outlook for MCI. Most analysts expect the FCC to scrap its regulation of ATandamp;T's rate-of-return on long-distance service. Instead of dictating the telephone giant's profit margins, the agency would set a ceiling on prices. MCI supports the plan as a way of slowing rate cuts and increasing the predictability of pricing. Most telecommunications analysts concur that the proposed changes will help ATandamp;T's competitors gain stability.    Not everyone on Wall Street, however, agrees that MCI's improved stock price offers an accurate projection of the company's future. Jack Grubman, a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc. who used to work at ATandamp;T, calls the MCI rally &quot;a little unwarranted and a little ahead of itself.&quot;    He attributes renewed interest in MCI to &quot;pent-up desire on Wall Street to see someone compete with ATandamp;T,&quot; but he warns that MCI isn't out of the woods yet.    Investors, Mr. Grubman argues, have misread recent developments. The FCC's proposals for easing regulation of ATandamp;T give the industry leader new incentives to be more efficient, he says. Moreover, ATandamp;T still has room to cut costs, and MCI may not be able to keep up.    Meanwhile, MCI's business coups have been overrated, says Mr. Grubman. New contracts reported so far this year aren't big enough to improve earnings signficantly, he contends. The United Airlines contract, for one, represents MCI's willingness to beat the competition on price, not service. &quot;Cutting price isn't something (MCI) can win at&quot; over the long haul, he asserts.    Mr. Grubman, an avowed contrarian on MCI, says he doesn't plan to change his longstanding negative rating of the company. But he admits that since June, his &quot;unattractive&quot; recommendation &quot;has been a lousy call.&quot;    ---   MCI   (OTC; Symbol: MCIC)   Business: Telecommunications   Year ended Dec. 31, 1986:   Revenue: $3.59 billion   Net loss: $448.4 million*   Second quarter, June 30, 1987:    Per-share earnings: 3 cents** vs. 6 cents    Average daily trading volume:   1,857,000 shares   Common shares outstanding: 284.3 million    *Includes after-tax charge of $16.9 million for debt extinguishment.    **Includes pre-tax gain of $6 million from antitrust settlements. </TEXT></DOC>
