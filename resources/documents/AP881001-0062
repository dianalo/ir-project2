(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Negotiators for Deere andamp; Co. and the UnitedAuto Workers reached a tentative agreement today on a three-yearcontract affecting more than 13,400 workers, company and unionspokesmen said.   Robert Combs, spokesman for the farm equipment manufacturer,announced the settlement shortly after 5 a.m. CDT, when pickets hadalready been posted in front of some plants. No details of the pactwere immediately released.   Talks between the two sides had continued in Moline, Ill., pastthe union's midnight Friday strike deadline.   The agreement covers employees at plants in Atlanta,Minneapolis, Denver and smaller towns in Illinois and Iowa, Combssaid.   UAW spokesman Karl Mantyla confirmed that the agreement had beenreached, but said he could not comment on details.   ``It's subject to some ironing out of language,'' said Mantylaafter approximately 20 hours of talks. He said a schedule for aratification vote likely would be decided on during the weekend.   Although pickets were reported after midnight at some Deereplants, Mantyla said no strike had been called.   ``No instructions were issued from here to walk out, but we havenot advised them not to, either. We don't know what the localunions are doing,'' he said.   Bruce Davis, a spokesman for UAW Local 94, said a strike overlocal issues continues this morning at the Dubuque Deere plant,despite the tentative agreement on a companywide contract. He wouldnot elaborate on the issues.   The 5,377 workers at Deere's largest plant in Waterloo, Iowa,delayed any strike action, said Jerry Niedert, first vice presidentof the union local in Waterloo.   The tentative agreement apparently averts a full-scale walkoutlike the bitter strike in 1986-87 that ended after 163 days withemployees' acceptance of a wage freeze and other concessions.   In Bridgeton, Mo., negotiators for Caterpillar Inc. and the UAWagreed earlier Friday to extend their contract indefinitely,averting a midnight strike deadline and allowing the union to focusits attention on Deere.   The extension agreement between Peoria-based Caterpillar and theUAW came just 12 hours before the current contract would haveexpired and avoided a possible walkout by 17,500 Caterpillarworkers in five states.</TEXT></DOC>
