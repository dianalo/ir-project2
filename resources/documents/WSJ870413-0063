Garcia</HL><DD> 04/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   The enormous drain of equities from the stock market produced by record takeover, leveraged buyout and corporate stock buyback activity in the past three years might be just about over, some analysts and economists say.    With stocks selling at two times book value and nearly 20 times their trailing 12-months earnings, says Michael Metz, a market strategist with Oppenheimer andamp; Co. in New York, &quot;The great equity shrink is about over.&quot;    He believes it would be prudent for most company managements to issue stock now, when investors are willing to pay high prices for new shares, &quot;even if a company might not need the capital right away.&quot;    As the stock market soared in the first 10 weeks of 1987, the new-issues market was heating up. According to Securities Data Co., a New York-based research firm, the number of new issues and the amount of money being raised through initial public offerings jumped to $7.5 billion in 140 issues in the first quarter, compared with just $2 billion in 96 issues during the first quarter of 1986.    Along with companies selling stock for the first time, there has been a continuing flow of stock offerings and convertible bonds from concerns that are already public.    While estimates differ on just how much equity will be added to or taken out of the stock market this year, few analysts are looking for the drain that has taken place in the past three years to continue at the same pace. According to Salomon Brothers Inc. figures, equity outstanding shrank an amazing net $216.6 billion in the three-year period of 1984 through 1986.    David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., expects there might be net new issuance of about $6 billion this year. He and other analysts generally agree that the new supply of stock this year won't stifle the bull market.    He says that the $6 billion anticipated gain in equity outstanding would amount to only about one-quarter of one percent of the $2.4 trillion market value of all stock outstanding at the end of last year. That's roughly equal to a six-point increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. &quot;We can get that kind of a move in 10 minutes,&quot; Mr. Wyss says.    Steven Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. in New York, says concern about new supply overwhelming the stock market &quot;is completely unwarranted.&quot; He expects mergers, acquisitions, corporate buybacks and leveraged buyouts this year will take out about $60 billion to $70 billion, while new stock issues will amount to about $60 billion, for an estimated maximum net reduction in equity of about $10 billion.    However, analysts at Salomon Brothers are breaking away from the pack, looking for net equity retirement this year of nearly $70 billion. James McKeon believes as long as interest rates remain low, investors aren't too concerned about default, and investment bankers are willing to finance mergers, acquisitions, and leveraged buyouts, the trend is likely to continue.    The folks at Securities Data believe that given the number of prospective offerings filed with the SEC, it looks as if the new-issue market will be much busier this year than it was in 1986 -- a record year for initial offerings, as companies raised $22 billion in 716 issues.    Companies in the technology, specialty retailing and pollution control industries tend to dominate the new-issue calendar, says Robert Natale, an analyst who follows special situations at Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. Companies that were taken private a few years are now planning to go public once again. Among them are Tiffany andamp; Co., Topps, the baseball card company, and Western Auto Supply.    Some of the new offerings are coming from companies that are selling an interest in some of their units to the public. For instance, American Express plans to sell 18 million shares in its Shearson Lehman Brothers brokerage unit, and Bally Manufacturing is selling an interest its Bally's Health andamp; Tennis Corp. unit.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stock prices ended only slightly lower, despite sharp early declines in the dollar and the bond market that threatened to do much more damage in the stock market.    There was continued disappointment that the U.S. and its major economic allies did little more than reaffirm a previous agreement to stabilize currency rates at their Washington meeting last Wednesday. Traders reported deep and widespread bearishness Friday morning.    But after an erratic trading session in all markets, the dollar recovered somewhat after reported widespread central bank intervention in the foreign-exchange market. The bond market followed the dollar.    Gains in oil and semiconductor issues also helped offset losses elsewhere in the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.42 point at 2338.78 after showing a loss of about 15 points in the morning. It fell more than 51 points for the week.    The broader market averages also showed tiny losses by the closing bell, but losers had a 2-to-1 lead over gainers on the New York Stock Exchange. The turbulent market kept some investors sidelined as volume contracted to 169.5 million shares from 180.3 million.    A 15.6% rise in orders for semiconductor products as well as good quarterly earnings reports gave a boost to some semiconductor issues. Texas Instruments rose 3 1/8 to 199 7/8, Advanced Micro Devices gained 3/4 to 21, and Intel moved up 7/8 to 44 7/8 in over-the-counter trading. Motorola eased 1/2 to 58, and National Semiconductor fell 1/4 to 14 5/8.    Prospects of stable oil prices at higher levels compelled investors to buy these issues, although crude oil prices declined in the futures markets. </TEXT></DOC>
