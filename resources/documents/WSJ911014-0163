London's stock market should be able to chalk up somehefty gains, they said, especially if further bullish signssurface on the health of the British economy.                                                                                                          Takeover activity that emerged toward the end of the thirdquarter could intensify and extend the market's run, withmore cash coming back into play.   Over the past three months, the London market has tradedin a fairly narrow range, attempting to make forays on recordhighs, only to run out of steam and drift lower. But in thepast month or so, the market has shown a renewed ability toreach what many regard as new support at 2600 on theFinancial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, which closedFriday at 2555.0. The market has been rising in tandem withthe political temperature. News from senior governmentministers that Prime Minister John Major has decided againsta November general election has allowed the market to take aturn for the better, market participants said.   Paul Harrison, vice president at Salomon BrothersInternational in London, said, &quot;This means that the marketcan go back to focusing on fundamentals.&quot; These includeinflation figures, a possibile further reduction in baselending rates from their current 10.5% level and theexpectation that corporate earnings are ready to recover.Britain's inflation for August was 4.7% on a year-to-yearbasis, with expectations for September's figure of about 4%.   And after some disappointing news from Britain's largestcompanies in the first nine months, the market may experienceits first rays of sunshine on the perception that things areimproving.   Mike Young, director of European investment strategy atMerrill Lynch Capital Markets in London, said, &quot;With earningsexpectations already talked down and clear evidence that theeconomy is beginning to bottom out, any earnings pickup willsupport the market.&quot;   A clearer time horizon also has opened up for corporatedeal-making, as the potential uncertainty of an electionvictory by the opposition Labor Party looks more remote. Adirector at a British brokerage firm said: &quot;It's realistic tothink that it's easier under the current government to dodeals now.&quot; With the British economy at the bottom of itscycle, corporate suitors see a window of opportunity.   Analysts said too that any retreat and consolidation bystocks often mark the first step in an assault on new highs.On Friday, London shares' weak finish came on concerns aboutthe political ramifications of a sluggish economicturnaround. The FTSE's loss of 15.8 points to 2555.0represented a 2.7% loss for the week. The FT 30stock indexshed 2.5 points to 1953.9. Volume was 869.6 million shares,compared with 535.3 million in the previous session.   &quot;Almost certainly, the market will have a nervous phase inthe run-up to an election,&quot; said Salomon's Mr. Harrison, whois targeting a year-end FT-SE 100 between 2800 and 2850. Theindex stood at 2143.5 at the end of 1990.   &quot;But with the flotation {by the government of part of itsBritish Telecommunications stake coming in November} alreadylooking as if it will be oversubscribed, and with underlyingimprovements in the economy yet to come through, we believethe London market is due for a bounce,&quot; Mr. Harrison said.   Yet Cathy Savage, political analyst at Nomura ResearchInstitute in London, said, &quot;By early December, if the marketisn't seeing the Conservatives moving into a clear lead inthe polls, then there will be a number of stocks underpressure,&quot; such as recently privatized water and electricitycompanies. A general election must be called by June 1992.For a spring election, she said, the campaign probably wouldget under way by mid-December.   If Mr. Major is boosted by opinion polls and interestrates are lowered in tandem with a cut in inflation, shesaid, the market will get a boost at year end. But it couldstumble, she said, if it appears that the Conservatives at aEuropean Community meeting in early December are thwartingpolitical and monetary union and Britain's economy isn'trebounding.   Elsewhere, the pace of rights issues is likely to taperoff in the fourth quarter, traditionally a quieter time forrefinancing operations, analysts said. This also would be acalming factor for the market after this year's heftycash-raising maneuvers.   London sectors likely to get buying favor include cyclicalservices, analysts said, with quality retailers sought afteras consumer spending picks up. Names mentioned include Hansonand BTR among conglomerates, and BPB, RMC Group, Pilkington,Redland and Tarmac on the building products front.   Banks also are in line for a rise, as their margins willimprove on the time lag between a cut in market interestrates and the savings they eventually pass on to customers,analysts said. The banks will have an earnings recovery nextyear, they said, with Midland Bank and Lloyds Bank the twomost frequently mentioned.   ---   World Market Activity                                                                                                          Stocks fell broadly Friday in Tokyo on index-sellinglinked to weakness in stock futures.
