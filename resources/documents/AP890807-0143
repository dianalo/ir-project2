(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The day after his wife died, an 83-year-oldman sat in his dining room, surrounded by relatives, crying. ``Whydid she have to leave me?'' he moaned. Then he went into thebedroom and killed himself.   A former hard-driving insurance executive in his 60s, unable toadjust to the slower pace of retirement and depressed because ofthe loss of identity he derived from his work, took a job pumpinggas six months after settling in a retirement community. Threemonths later, he committed suicide.   An 82-year-old man with the debilitating and ultimately fatalamyotrophic lateral sclerosis _ Lou Gehrig's disease _ was becomingincreasingly helpless. Not wishing to burden his wife, he slashedhis wrists and bled to death.   The cases are typical of what experts say is a growingphenomenon, but one that can go unrecognized because some deathsaren't obviously suicide.   ``I've known people who would just sit in their apartments andeat nothing but 2 or 3 pieces of toast a day. Eventually they diefrom malnutrition,'' said Dr. Marv Miller, a San Diegogerontologist who wrote in 1979 that the elderly ``are deadlyserious about killing themselves.''   As the older population grows in a youth-oriented society, theproblem is worsening, Miller said. ``In some societies older peopleare venerated and respected, but not in this one.   ``Once people are out of the work force and no longercontributing to the productivity of society in an economic sense,society no longer has any use for them. This is a shame becauseafter the Depression this country was built back by the people whoare now the elderly.''   In 1986, the most recent figures available, the nation's suiciderate was 12.8 per 100,000 people. For those 65 and over, the ratewas 21.6 per 100,000; within that group, the breakdown was 19.7 forages 65-74; 25.2 for those 75-84; and 20.8 for those 85 and older.Ten years previously, those rates were 17.8, 20.8 and 17.9,respectively.   The National Center for Health Statistics, which compiles datafrom death certificates, reported 2,146 suicides among people 19and younger in 1986, and 6,275 in the 65-and-over group. Millersaid the actual number could exceed 10,000 because of theunder-reporting of elderly suicides.   ``The figures are appalling,'' said Dr. Robert N. Butler, authorof the 1976 Pulitzer Prize-winning book ``Why Survive? Being Old inAmerica.''   Cuts in social programs and changing attitudes may be partly toblame for the 25 percent rise in late-life suicide since 1981, saidDr. Nancy J. Osgood, a Medical College of Virginia gerontologist.``In the last five or six years there has been a growing feelingthat suicide is an acceptable solution to deal with life'sproblems, especially if you're old.''   The problem is worse among men, particularly white men. In 1986,the suicide rate among men aged 65-74 was 35.5, compared to 7.2 forwomen. In the 75-84 group, the rates were 54.8 and 7.5; for 85 andolder, 61.6 and 4.7.   ``Many men feel that when they are no longer working they haveno value. They have merged their work with their identity, whichprecipitates an identity crisis upon retirement. They aretraumatized by so much free time,'' said Miller, author of``Suicide After Sixty. The Final Alternative.''   Today's elderly women, on the other hand, ``were wife andmother, and maintain their same roles throughout life,'' he said.They also can ask for help without it being interpreted as a signof weakness.   ``Men can't do that,'' he said. ``Men can't even cry.''   In addition to the loss of self-worth brought by retirement,other major reasons for suicide among the elderly are loss of aloved one, physical illness and, to a lesser extent, a motivationto defy or control death, which Miller said is becoming more commonfor people who are terminally ill.   While shooting is the primary method among all suicides, theelderly sometimes use covert techniques like starvation, refusal totake medicine and overdosing on prescribed drugs. Such covertsuicide, combined with the stigma of taking one's life, leads tounder-reporting, Miller said.   ``Someday, someone very close to a president will commitsuicide, and then there will be a hue and cry raised across thecountry. We need the president to enunciate a clear policy to lowerthe number of suicides by a certain time.''   Reporting would be improved if doctors were taught to recognizethe signs of suicide, and outreach programs should be set up toidentify and treat potentially suicidal older people, experts say.   The warning signs include behavior like stockpiling medicine,changing wills and buying a gun. Other indications are extreme moodand behavior swings, expressed feelings of hopelessness andworthlessness, and major changes in weight, eating and sleepingpatterns.   Only California, Delaware, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and RhodeIsland have state-operated suicide prevention and interventionprograms aimed at older people, according to an October 1988 surveyfor the American Association of Retired Persons. Virginia isplanning a statewide education effort.   Nevada has the nation's highest rate of geriatric suicide at32.2 per 100,000 people, followed by Arizona, California, Colorado,Vermont, New Mexico, Idaho, Oregon, Virginia and Florida, said Dr.John L. McIntosh, a psychologist at Indiana University whospecializes in the elderly. Massachusetts, with a rate of 9.9 per100,000 people, was the nation's lowest.   ``No one knows for sure'' why rates are high in some states,said McIntosh, who wrote ``Suicide and the Elderly'' with Ms.Osgood in 1986. The reason could lie in geographic isolation andeasy availability of firearms in rural areas.   The suicide rate could be reduced by a national program thatencouraged the elderly to remain productive, said Butler, directorof geriatrics at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Hesuggested creating a National Senior Service Corps to takeadvantage of the vast, untapped talent pool.   There are any number of such programs for the young but none forolder people, he said. ``Once again as a society we're missing theboat. We should create opportunities for the elderly to contributeto society. It's a shame not to make use of such talent.''   Miller suggested putting day care centers in nursing homes``where elderly people, who have an affinity for children, wouldcare for them and even be paid for it.'' Corporate America alsocould play a significant role by providing pre-and post-retirementcounseling and letting workers put in fewer hours three or fouryears before they retire, cushioning the shock of leaving.   ``Anyone without sensitivity to the problem is reallyshort-sighted,'' he said. ``We're all going to be elderly one day.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 10</NOTE></DOC>
