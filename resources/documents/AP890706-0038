(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors of two former top PTL aidesurged a jury to focus on alleged tax evasion by the pair and not tobe distracted by big salaries or television celebrities at theministry.   ``This case is not about Jim Bakker, Tammy Bakker or RichardDortch,'' Justice Department prosecutor Joseph Bender said,referring to PTL's founder, his wife and former top aide.   ``It's not about whether the defendants collected exorbitantsalaries or bonuses. It's about the income the defendants failed topay taxes on.''   But the attorney for brothers David and James Taggart said theopposite in his opening remarks Wednesday.   ``This case is not about taxes _ we concede at the outset thereare some taxes owed by David and James,'' lawyer Ben Cotten said.``This is a case about authorization, intent and doubt.''   The Taggarts were indicted by a federal grand jury in December oncharges of failing to pay $487,000 in income taxes from 1984 to1987. The indictment was issued the same day that Bakker and Dortchwere indicted on charges of mail and wire fraud.   Bakker's and Dortch's trial on charges of diverting more than $4million of PTL money to their own use and conspiring to defraud PTLcontributors is scheduled to open Aug. 28 in Charlotte.   In a four-hour hearing Wednesday, attorneys for Bakker and Dortchargued that the case should be moved out of western North Carolinabecause of pretrial publicity. Dortch's attorney also asked that hisclient be tried separately. U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor did not saywhen he would rule on the requests.   In the Taggart case prosecutors said David Taggart, 32, who wasBakker's personal aide, and Taggart's 35-year-old brother, PTL'sformer interior decorator, used ministry credit cards to get largecash advances and used blank PTL checks to pay American Expressbills.   Bender said the government would prove the Taggarts illegallyused more than $1.1 million in PTL money to buy such things as a NewYork condominium, luxury autombiles, jewelry, furs and designerclothing.   The first prosecution witness, special Internal Revenue Serviceagent Deborah Burney, said the Taggarts received nearly $1.7 millionin PTL funds from 1984 to 1987 on top of their salaries.   ``We found there was an understatement'' of their taxable incomeon their tax filings during that period, she said.   Cotten said witnesses and documents would show his clients hadauthorization to use the credit cards and take out cash advancesfrom the highest levels at PTL.   He described his clients as hard-working, dedicated employees whowere given vast responsibilities in running the multimillion-dollarministry in the early 1980s.   ``During this time frame, several people were getting vastamounts of benefits through procedures in place that were not underthe control of David and James Taggart,'' Cotten said.   The witness list in the Taggart trial looks like a ``Who's Who''of TV evangelism.   Prosecutors are expected to call up to 69 witnesses, includingevangelists Jerry Falwell, John Wesley Fletcher, Rex Humbard and RexHumbard Jr.   Cotten's witnesses could include Bakker's daughter, Tammy SueChapman, and a former PTL board member, the Rev. Aimee Cortese.   If convicted, the Taggarts each could be sentenced to 25 years inprison and face fines of more than $1 million.</TEXT></DOC>
