The step is meant to make up for a decline in shipments from Japan because of the yen's strength and to counter the growing market share in Europe of other Asian countries. The Chinese government has asked the venture, in which Sanyo holds 50%, to step up exports to help China increase its foreign reserves. </TEXT></DOC>
