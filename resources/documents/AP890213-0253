Japanese waited to see what prosecutors would do next, sincedozens of politicians, businessmen and journalists were among thosewho bought bargain-priced stock unavailable to the public, and thenprofited handsomely when public sales began and prices soared.   Among the four arrested was Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and formerchairman of Recruit Co., the information conglomerate at the centerof the scandal.   Ezoe and Hiroshi Kobayashi, vice president of First Finance, aRecruit subsidiary that financed the stock sales, were held onsuspicion of offering bribes in return for favors related toRecruit's business activities.   Also arrested were Ei Shikiba and Hisahiko Hasegawa, formerdirectors of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's largestcompany, for altegedly receiving bribes from Recruit in tnyPCorm ofbargain shares. Both have said they did not provide any favors forRecruit.   Recruit and NTT said in Statements that they regretted theprosecutors' actions.   Takeshita told reporters Monday he hoped for a full investigationinto the scandal, but refused to comment further. A Takeshita aideand relative have been linked to the stock purchases.   The Japan Socialist Party credited public disgust with thescandal for its victory in a special parliamentary election Sunday,and it demanded that Takeshita resign or call new general elections.   Replying in Parliament, Takeshita dismissed the demands. He saidhe ``humbly accepted'' the election results and that his governingLiberal Democratic Party will work for reforms to restore publictrust in politics.   In making the arrests, prosecutors said the Supreme Court ruledin July that the sale of stock whose price was sure to rise andwhich could not be easily purchased by the general public amountedto bribery.   Japanese law provides for up to five years in prison forreceivers of bribes, and up to three years for those who offerbribes.   The scandal surfaced last summer, raising questions of ethics andmoney links between business and politicians.   The only previous arrest had been of a Recruit official accusedof trying to bribe an opposition member of Parliament to soft-pedalan investigation into the affair.   Takeshita formed a new Cabinet last December to put the scandalbehind him, but two ministers soon were forced to resign after itwas disclosed they had continued receiving political donations fromRecruit.   In all, three Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen politiciansand businessmen have resigned because of the scandal.   In Sunday's special election, the Japan Socialist Party won theupper house seat of a Liberal Democrat who died in December. Theelection in Fukuoka in southern Japan was the first for a nationaloffice since the scandal surfaced.   Takako Doi, the Socialists' chairwoman, said in Parliament Mondaythat Takeshita should resign.   ``Either the entire Cabinet must resign, or the prime ministermust dissolve Parliament so the people can express their will,'' Ms.Doi said.   A dissolution of Parliament would force elections in the powerfullower house, where the Liberal Democrats have more than 300 of the512 seats.   Takeshita told Japanese reporters the special election was a``complete defeat. I never anticipated it.''   ``I will stake everything on political reform,'' he toldParliament on Monday.   An election is scheduled in July for half the seats inParliament's upper house. A severe setback then could threatenTakeshita's chances to win another two-year term as party leader andprime minister in October.   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index fell Monday for thefirst time in eight sessions. Market analysts blamed the governingparty's defeat in the special election and eroding confidence in theTakeshita administration.</TEXT></DOC>
