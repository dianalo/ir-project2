While clinical findings andlaboratory data frequently narrow the differential diagnosis, symptomoverlap generally precludes definitive diagnosis among the various diseasescausing acute right upper quadrant pain. Fortunately, the advent of newerdiagnostic imaging modalities has greatly improved the rapidity and reliabilityof diagnosis in these patients. An additional challenge to the physician,with increased awareness of the importance of cost effectiveness in medicine,is to select appropriate diagnostic schema that rapidly establish accuratediagnoses in the most economical fashion possible.
