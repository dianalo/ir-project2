The Phoenix-based regional airline reported a fourth-quarter loss of $18.8 million, compared with earnings of $2.5 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. The loss follows an $11.9 million deficit in the third quarter, at the time the largest quarterly loss in America West's four-year history.    The cutback in operations interrupts America West's rapid expansion, designed to ward off the consolidation that has swallowed several other smaller carriers. During 1987, America West added 2,900 employees, boosted its fleet of aircraft to 69 from 46 and added 11 cities to the 34 it flew to in 1986.    The company expects to save between $60 million and $70 million in 1988 from the reduction in operations and hopes to show a profit by the third quarter. &quot;Second half profits should be sufficient to make the year profitable,&quot; said Edward R. Beauvais, the company's chairman and chief executive officer.    Beginning March 1, the company plans to cancel 15 daily round-trip flights in the West and trim two of its eight daily flights from Las Vegas to New York and Baltimore. Also, America West plans to take six of its more than 60 planes out of service. Last month the company closed its Chicago Midway operations and plans to stop flying to Springfield, Mo., March 1.    As part of the cutback, Mr. Beauvais said, the airline has begun to shrink its work force about 500 employees. The reduction will be accomplished through attrition and voluntary leaves and won't require any layoffs, he said.    Largely on the strength of its expanded operations, fourth-quarter revenue soared about 70% to $164.2 million from a year earlier. The company's $45.7 million loss in 1987 compared with earnings of $3 million, or 11 cents a share, in 1986. Revenue rose about 75% to $575.4 million. </TEXT></DOC>
