The court said it will review a pair of free-speech challengesto such an Indiana law.   Under Indiana's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizationslaw, patterned after the much-used federal RICO act, lawenforcement officials are authorized to seize any property used ina racketeering enterprise.   The law was invoked in March 1984 against three Fort Waynebookstores selling sexually explicit materials, each accused of atleast two violations of the state's obscenity laws.   Law enforcement officials padlocked the stores and seized theirnventories.   A short time later, similar legal action was taken against threeadult bookstores in Indianapolis.   The three Fort Wayne bookstores were allowed to reopen in April1985 but only one, Fort Wayne Books, remains in business. It filedthe appeal acted on today.   The three Indianapolis bookstores also have gone out of business.   Later, two bookstores in Howard County, Ind., were prosecutedunder the state law.   An Indiana appeals court ruled in 1985 that applying the stateRICO law to those whose only offenses are alleged obscenity lawviolations impermissibly hinders constitutionally protected freedomof speech.   The appeals court said the padlocking of the bookstoresrepresented an impermissible ``prior restraint'' of materials notyet ruled obscene.   The Indiana Supreme Court last year reversed the appeals court,ruling that applying the RICO law in such a way is valid becausethe Legislature did not pass it to promote censorship.   ``The seizure order does not constitute a prior restraint or inany other manner impinge upon'' Fort Wayne Books' free-speechrights, the state court said in a 3-2 ruling.   In other action, the court:   _ Agreed to consider reinstating the death sentence of a Floridaman convicted of killing an 8-year-old girl in 1978.   The court is expected to use the case to study death rowinmates' right to raise new issues when they turn to the federalcourts for help and to decide whether Florida juries may be toldtheir life-or-death recommendations are subject to the trialjudge's approval.   _ Left intact a $1.13 million jury award to an Idaho boyparalyzed from the waist down after he was given a vaccination forthree diseases.   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the vaccinemanufacturer that such verdicts could force drug companies toabandon the production of essential vaccines.   _ Ruled unanimously that financially troubled farmers may notavoid foreclosure under federal bankruptcy law by promising to usetheir labor, experience and expertise in continuing to operatetheir farm.   By an 8-0 vote, the court said a secured creditor's right to``adequate protection'' under bankruptcy law cannot be satisfied bysuch a promise.   _ Refused to free churches from having to comply with statefinancial-disclosure laws when waging public referendum campaigns.   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federalquestion,'' turned away a challenge by 13 churches from Jackson,Tenn., to a law they contend violates their freedom of religion andfreedom of speech.   _ Let stand a ruling that the public has no right to attendhearings into the alleged tainting or bribing of a criminal trialjury while the trial is underway.   The justices, without comment, refused to second-guess thevalidity of conducting such hearings in secret during the 1986racketeering trial of Louisiana Gov. Edwin W. Edwards.   _ Cleared the way for a jury trial in former Massachusetts Gov.Edward J. King's $3.6 million libel lawsuit against the BostonGlobe.   The justices, over one dissenting vote, left intact aMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling that a jury should hearKing's contention that he was libeled by a Nov. 8, 1981, column.   _ Cleared the way for a trial in what may become an importanttest case on the power of cities to control rents and otherwiseprotect mobile home residents.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Santa Barbara,Calif., officials aimed at killing a lawsuit by owners of a mobilehome park who claim they unfairly are being deprived of theirproperty's full value.   In seeking help from the nation's highest court in the adultbookstore case, lawyers for Fort Wayne Books argued that ``neitherinterim nor permanent restraints of the type involved in this casemay constitutionally be enforced prior to final judidicalresolution'' unless the law guarantees speedy appellate review.   The appeal noted that as yet no trial has been held to determinewhether any of the materials seized from Fort Wayne Books wereobscene and therefore not constitutionally protected.   The justices were told that ``a growing number of states areadopting similar RICO laws, and there is a conflict among thestates as to their constitutionality.''   The adult bookstore cases are Fort Wayne Books vs. Indiana,87-470; and Sappenfield vs. Indiana, 87-614.</TEXT></DOC>
