(ICL) outright, promptingfear and outrage from the EEC.andM;Unlike Fujitsu's strategy, NEC's stake -- whatever that may be -- is unlikelyto pave the way for total control of CdMB, several analysts said.andP;  Not onlyis it doubtful that the French government would sell control of the company,but CdMB is not wholly dependent on NEC's technology, as ICL was onFujitsu's.andP;  CdMB also owns the computer businesses of Honeywell Inc. and U.S.andO;PC maker Zenith Data Systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
