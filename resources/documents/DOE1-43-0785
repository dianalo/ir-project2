<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-0785 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Endangered Species Act of 1976 was passed in response to a concernthat various species of fish, wildlife, and plants had become or werein danger of becoming extinct from pressures of trade or economic growthand development. The Act is administered by the US Fish and WildlifeService (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for speciesunder their respective jurisdictions and by the Department of Agriculture'sAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to regulate the importand export of endangered plants. APHIS has inadequate resources to preventthe sizeable and sophisticated illegal international trade in protectedplants. The Committee recognizes the need to authorize the Fish and WildlifeService to share the responsibility now vested in APHIS for prosecutingviolations of plant importation and exportation provisions of the Act.The purpose of this legislation is to authorize appropriations to carryout the Act for Fiscal Years 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992, and toamend the Act.</TEXT></DOC>
