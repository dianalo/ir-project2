Annual sales of her home-made potions amounted to a mere $200last year. But this spring Edwards expects to sell $20,000 worth ofproducts thanks to a $5,000 loan secured with the help of Women'sWorld Banking.   The non-profit group has helped at least 250,000 women worldwideget started in business over the past decade through counseling orby securing loans.   ``It brought my business from essentially a dream into athriving business,'' said the 41-year-old Edwards, a single motherwho had little hope of getting a bank loan before Women's WorldBanking's Maine affiliate took up her cause.   Although it pales in size to other global lending institutions,the New York-based group has had a profound economic - andpolitical - impact in clearing the way for many businesswomen.   In Thailand, the group helped 100 women start a dairycooperative by helping them get loans totaling $1 million. And thegroup's affiliate in India has grown into an active savings andloan program for about 60,000 women - many of them from the lowlyregarded untouchable caste.   Thanks to negotiations by the group, the governments of Japanand Kenya have stricken regulations that required women to havetheir loans guaranteed by their husbands or fathers.   ``In most countries of Latin America and Asia, the culturalbarrier has been broken,'' said group president Nancy Barry.   Ironically, the United States is the final frontier for theglobal organization, she said.   Focusing on developing countries since its inception 10 yearsago, the group's five U.S. affiliates thus far only have the powerto help women draw up business plans, write loan applications andsuggest alternate funding routes. But before the end of the year,at least one branch - the Akron, Ohio, affiliate - expects to startguaranteeing bank loans like its overseas counterparts.   It's a significant step. Despite notions of the United States asprogressive in women's rights, old ways sometimes die hard in thenation's predominantly male lending industry.   ``Credit isn't without bias, which is different thandiscrimination,'' said Barbara Lange, executive director of Women'sEntrepreneurial Growth Organization (WEGO), the Akron branch. ``Apart of the lending process has to do with the comfort level of thebanking officer.''   For example, when physical therapist Claudia Miller set out lastyear to get a loan to start her own practice in Akron, the singlewoman had no idea her marital status would become a liability. Butthe bank's loan officer essentially ignored the financial caseshe'd built and instead insisted on checking out the income levelof her part-time partner's husband.   Miller, 42, decided to seek an alternative method of funding.Working with WEGO - not yet set up to guarantee loans - Millerdeveloped a cohesive business plan that led to a creativealternative. Instead of outright buying the $75,000 high-techbusiness equipment her practice required, Miller agreed to lease itwith an option to buy later on.   Such creativity is repeated throughout the 40 countries in whichWomen's World Banking has branches.   In the case of Edwards, the potion purveyor, Women's WorldBanking helped her write a business plan that convinced a localeconomic development agency to loan her $5,334. She spent the moneyon newspaper advertisements, a 12-page mail-order catalog andspiffy packaging.   Her business plan already has shown positive results. Edwardssaid she was working 16-hour days to meet the surge in requests forher wild-gathered potions of comfrey, colts foot and othermedicinal herbs. And this fall, the West Athens, Maine, woman wasable to achieve a nearly 20-fold jump in sales from the previousyear - a windfall since her only other source of income was foodstamps and $80 a month in child support.   With her new-found income, Edwards, who left Hoboken, N.J., 20years ago, hopes to turn an outside shed into a new drying area forher herbs.   Barry, the Women's World Banking president, said women generallyare good loan risks because they ``tend to be very practical andhave their feet on the ground,'' know how to ``juggle a lot ofballs at a time,'' and are ``balanced with a sense of thepossible.''   ``All of those skills are precisely what it takes to make asmall business work,'' explained Barry, 41, a former World Bankemployee who pioneered that group's projects in small businessdevelopment in 1975.   Barry, a Harvard MBA graduate, spends her weeks girdling theglobe to make sure things are running smoothly.   During a recent workday, ten floors above the screechingcongestion of midtown Manhattan, Barry filled her corner officewith smoke from her freshly lit Marlboro - taken from a10-cigarette pack she pocketed from a airplane from Tokyo the nightearlier. She noted that her November itinerary called for stops inno less than seven countries.   ``I actually got to sleep in my own bed last night - it was kindof exciting,'' she said, as she prepared to leave Malaysia in twodays.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday, Dec. 2</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
