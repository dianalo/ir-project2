Identical U.S. District Court lawsuits filed Monday said Bank ofAmerica was to blame for the losses because, as the loans trustee,it failed to ensure proper procedures were followed.   Huge losses in the complicated case stem from failure to followfederal guidelines for collection of $1.4 billion in student loans,which in turn voided federal guarantees for the loans.   Bank of America, which anticipated the suits, said it would haveno comment because it had yet to see the filings.   Filing the suits were Citibank, the nation's largest bank;Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank of the Netherlands; and seven of Japan'slargest banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Sumitomo, Fuji, Industrial Bank ofJapan, Mitsubishi, Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Trust.   State and federal auditors discovered required collectionprocedures were neglected on at least 250,000 loans, the suits said.   The banks involved in the suits had extended letters of creditto back the $1.4 billion in loans, mostly to vocational schoolstudents who have a high default rate, the suits said.   While the letters of credit made the banks responsible fordefaults, the banks believed they were protected because the loanswere guaranteed by the federal government. Strict collectionguidelines were required, however.   The U.S. Department of Education said in March that it wouldn'thonor the loan guarantees.   ``As a result, the banks will be forced to pay out hundreds ofmillions of dollars ... which will not be reimbursed,'' thelawsuits said.   Losses have already exceeded $350 million and estimates of totallosses range from $450 million to $650 million. Bank of Tokyo saidit alone has lost $177 million.</TEXT></DOC>
