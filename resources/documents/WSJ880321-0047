Because of their big U.S. investments, Japanese insurers always worry about dollar-yen exchange rates. But a quirk in Japanese accounting rules makes them even more concerned each March. That's when the Japanese insurers face possible write-downs of the value of their nonlisted, foreign-currency-denominated securities. The Japanese fiscal year ends March 31, and if the yen appreciates more than 15% in a fiscal year, insurers must take the write-downs.    That cutoff point is mighty close. The yen has risen 14% against the U.S. currency since the previous March 31, making the insurance companies nervous about posting currency-translation losses. So nervous, traders say, that the companies are doing what they can to avert a further decline of the dollar, at least till the end of the month.    In turn, traders are concerned about a sharp drop of the dollar when April arrives and Japanese investors end their dollar-support strategies. &quot;April is a crucial month for the dollar, and I think the dollar will go down,&quot; says Masakazu Miyamori, senior vice president and chief foreign exchange trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd.'s New York branch.    Attention in the market is focused for now on what the dollar's average exchange rate with the yen will be for March. This year the average dollar-yen rate for March, rather than the rate the last day of March as in previous years, will determine whether or not insurance companies will have to recognize foreign exchange losses on their nonlisted foreign securities. By using the average rate for the month, the Japanese hoped to avoid the market volatility seen in the final days of previous Japanese fiscal year ends, as Japanese institutions jumped in and out of currency positions seeking an advantage.    This year's &quot;magic rate,&quot; as one trader put it, is 126.85 yen to the dollar. An average rate below that level will trigger the need for revaluing U.S. portfolios. The average is based on the dollar's daily fixing at the major Tokyo banks.    One U.S. government bond trader in New York says he has noticed the dollar is often at its intraday high during the daily fixing at 10 a.m. Tokyo time. That suggests that interested parties are bidding the dollar up at that moment.    As of last Wednesday, according to the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.'s calculations, the dollar's average rate for March stood at 128.17 yen. That meant as long as the dollar doesn't average below 125.27 yen for the rest of the month, the average rate will remain safely above the feared level.    The dollar was quoted at 127.95 yen in late New York trading Friday. In January, however, the dollar traded down to 120.20 yen, a 40-year low.    Japanese insurance companies are getting credit for buoying the dollar. &quot;I saw a lot of buying orders in the name of Japanese insurance companies; orders to buy (dollars) at below 128 yen,&quot; Sanwa's Mr. Miyamori said last week. &quot;They say they are buying more if the dollar falls. They're willing to support the dollar,&quot; he said.    Other traders note a slack in the usually heavy flow of dollar sell orders from Japanese customers, removing a considerable amount of downward pressure on the dollar. &quot;Normally, in any given month, these guys have phenomenal amounts to do&quot; in dollar sales for yen, Richard E. Witten, vice president of foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., New York, says. But this month, &quot;there has been a dearth of selling activity,&quot; he says.    Traders fear that this month's calm may precede a storm of dollar selling in April, as Japanese institutions dump the U.S. currency purchased in March, and pent-up sell orders are released. &quot;Once the month ends, we might see resumed activity which might send the dollar down,&quot; Mr. Witten says.    Some traders dispute assertions that companies are buying dollars to prop the U.S. currency. &quot;They're not so stupid a bunch of guys. Even the Bank of Japan couldn't stop the dollar's decline,&quot; says Ryohei Takashima, chief corporate foreign exchange trader at Bank of Tokyo Ltd., New York. &quot;And (the insurance companies) are not central banks,&quot; he adds.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar firmed against the European currencies Friday and fell against the yen and Canadian dollar.    The dollar's gains came as traders bought the U.S. currency to cover short, or oversold positions established ahead of Thursday's merchandise trade report.    The dollar was quoted at 1.6938 West German marks in late New York trading, up from 1.6915 Thursday. The British pound slipped to $1.8250, from $1.8333.    The dollar fell to 127.95 yen, from 128.65, while the Canadian dollar climbed to 80.09 U.S. cents, from 80.04 U.S. cents.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 30 cents an ounce to $444.30 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was three million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $446.25 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Friday, March 18, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
