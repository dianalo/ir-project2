The bank board's chairman, Danny Wall, declined on Sunday to namethe savings and loan institutions that are to be liquidated, The NewYork Times reported in Monday's editions.   He said the details of the action would be announced Monday inWashington.   But savings industry officials told the Times they expected theliquidations to be in California.   The Orange County Register, a Southern California newspaper,reported Sunday that federal regulators would be ``quickly arranginga cure'' for the American Diversified Savings Bank and the NorthAmerican Savings and Loan, two troubled institutions in Costa Mesa,Calif.   Wall and other bank board officials declined to comment on thatreport, according to the Times.   ``The liquidation will be the largest payout of this type,'' Wallsaid. Liquidation was a last resort, he added, taken only after suchmeasures as a merger with a healthier institution could not beachieved.   A spokesman for the bank board, Karl T. Hoyle, said theinstitutions to be liquidated had ``very high-yielding accounts.''American Diversified and North American Savings are known to offeramong the highest interest rates in the region.   The bank board oversees 3,200 savings institutions. Last month,the General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of Congress,estimated that more than 500 were insolvent, and more than 200``hopelessly insolvent.''   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which providesinsurance for depositors in savings institutions, does not havesufficient funds to cover deposits in all those institutions.   Last year Congress authorized the board to raise up to $10.8billion by selling bonds over the next three years to assistinsolvent savings and loan institutions.</TEXT></DOC>
