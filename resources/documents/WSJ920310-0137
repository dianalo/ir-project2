The justices said that by presenting evidence that thedefendant belonged to the white racist group AryanBrotherhood, a Delaware state prosecutor impinged on thekiller's First Amendment right to associate with other peopleholding similar beliefs.</LP><TEXT>   The 8-1 decision shouldn't provide much solace to criminaldefendants, however. In an opinion written by Chief JusticeWilliam Rehnquist, the high court stressed that the Delawareprosecutor could have legitimately relied on the contestedevidence if he had made it more clear to the jury thatmembership in the Aryan Brotherhood was relevant to thedefendant's crime, as opposed to showing his &quot;abstractbeliefs.&quot; Both the defendant and his victim were white.   Justice Clarence Thomas filed the lone dissent, contendingthat the jury could have inferred the relevance of membershipin a racist prison gang to the question of the defendant'scharacter and potential dangerousness.   The case involved the conviction of David Dawson for amurder he committed after escaping from prison in December1986. As constitutionally required before an execution isordered, the prosecutor sought to prove that &quot;aggravating&quot;circumstances surrounding the killing outweighed &quot;mitigating&quot;factors. Such evidence frequently includes the nature of thedefendant's character.   Mr. Dawson objected to the prosecutor telling the jurythat he had the words &quot;Aryan Brotherhood&quot; tattooed on hisright hand, as well as to expert testimony about the groupand photographs of a swastika that Mr. Dawson had painted onhis cell wall. The prosecutor agreed to withhold the experttestimony and presented instead a mutually agreed upondescription of the Aryan Brotherhood's origins and generalbeliefs. After hearing the stipulation and other evidence,the jury concluded that the aggravating evidence outweighedthe mitigating evidence and recommended the death penalty,which the judge imposed.   The defendant then appealed, and the Delaware SupremeCourt affirmed the death sentence. But the U.S. Supreme Courtset aside that decision, ordering the lower court toreconsider the matter. Emphasizing the unusual facts of thecase, the high court said the prosecutor had failed to provethe relevance of the disputed evidence by, for example,demonstrating that the Aryan Brotherhood had committedunlawful or violent acts. &quot;Delaware might have avoided theproblem if it had presented evidence showing more than mereabstract beliefs on Dawson's part,&quot; Chief Justice Rehnquistwrote.   The majority indicated to the Delaware Supreme Court thatupon reconsideration, the lower court could determine thatthe admission of the Aryan Brotherhood evidence was a&quot;harmless error,&quot; therefore allowing reinstatement of thedeath sentence. Another possibility would be for the state tohold a new sentencing proceeding, including additionalevidence that the high court found lacking.   Justice Thomas, in dissent, said that the jury couldproperly infer from mere membership in a racist prison gangthat the defendant engaged in criminal or &quot;deviant&quot;activities, which would be relevant to his character anddangerousness. Justice Thomas objected that the majority haddistorted the First Amendment's guarantee of the right toassociate with others and, in so doing, tied the hands ofprosecutors. (Dawson vs. Delaware)   In other action yesterday, the Supreme Court:   -- Ruled that a federal appeals court in somecircumstances may affirm a sentence in which the trial courtdeparted from the federal sentencing guidelines for invalid,as well as valid, reasons. But the justices instructedappeals courts to conduct an intensive review of challengesto federal sentences. (Williams vs. U.S.)   -- Agreed to decide whether police who participated in theremoval of a mobile home in an eviction may be sued for civildamages by the home's owners under the Fourth Amendment'sprotection against unreasonable searches and seizures.(Soldal vs. Cook County, Ill.)</TEXT></DOC>
