(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The level of saturated fat in porkdeclines if hogs are fed cooked soybeans, but the meat tastes justas good as conventional bacon and chops, researchers report.   The study was done by scientists at the University of Illinoisand at the Harlan E. Moore Heart Research Foundation of Champaign.   They say this is another step toward ``designer pigs'' forconsumers who want lean pork with less saturated fat than today'scuts.   The key is the diet of hogs, who are fed whole soybeansprocessed through an extruder.   The feed produced pork with a significantly higher ratio ofpolyunsaturated to saturated fat _ a 50 percent improvement in porkchops and a 100 percent improvement in bacon.   ``We can produce healthier pork and do it in an economicalway,'' said Dennis Leszczynski, a dietitian and food scientist atthe heart foundation. ``And there are no important differences inanimal performance, meat taste, texture, processing or storage.''   Peter Bechtel, a university meat scientist who worked withLeszczynski on the project, prepared a report on the findings for arecent meeting of the American Society of Animal Science in Ames,Iowa.   ``Pigs are like humans _ we're all a product of the kind of fatwe eat,'' said Bechtel. ``So we change the ratio of polyunsaturatedfat in the pork by altering the fat that goes in the hogs.''   The American Heart Association recommends that the ratio ofpolyunsaturated fat to saturated fat be 1-to-1, said Leszczynski.Feeding extruded soybeans improved the ratio from 0.28-to-1 to0.43-to-1 in pork chops, and from 0.25-to-1 to 0.50-to-1 in bacon,he said.   A lean chicken breast has a ratio of 0.83-to-1.   ``We're getting closer,'' said Leszczynski. ``The challenge nowis to see how much higher we can go without adversely affecting themeat quality or the economics.''   ``It is a step in the right direction but a pretty small one,''said Dean Ornish, director of the Preventive Medicine ResearchInstitute and member of the faculty of the school of medicine atthe University of California-San Francisco.   ``It is analogous to going from two packs a day to one pack. Theideal is to decrease your total fat intake and this does notaccomplish that,'' he said.   The study involved 160 pigs. Some had a diet that included 20percent extruded soubeans for the six weeks before slaughter.   Conventional hog rations contain corn and soybean meal. Thescientists substituted the extruded whole soybeans for the meal inorder to retain soy oil, which is relatively high inpolyunsaturated fat.   Research at the International Soybean Program at UI has shownthat extrusion not only leaves the oil in the final product, italso destroys the natural digestive inhibitors in soybeans.   Bechtel said most Illinois farmers already have soybeans; an$8,000 extruder could be shared by a group of farmers.   Some pork producers already deliver leaner animals to market byselecting breeds that have less fat and slaughtering them beforethey get too heavy. That has created pork cuts that are 97 percentlean.   Bechtel said his project showed that the composition of theremaining fat could be improved.   The final product may cost a little more to produce, so theresearchers said farmers will have to sell processors and consumerson the health value of their new pork to justify a higher price.</TEXT><NOTE>End advance for Aug. 20</NOTE></DOC>
