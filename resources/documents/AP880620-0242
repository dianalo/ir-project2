Not just a little blue,but depressed.   Studies indicate that clinical depression _ lasting at least twoweeks with appetite or sleep disturbance, feelings of worthlessnessor guilt, or thoughts of death _ is hitting earlier in baby boomersthan the preceding generation.   Female baby boomers, for example, have a 65 percent greaterchance than normal of being depressed some time in their lives. Andthe suicide rate among 15- to 24-year-olds in 1980 was nearly threetimes that of the group in 1950.   ``Depression has changed from a disease of people in their 40s,50s and older, to a disease of people in their 20s and 30s,'' saidRobert Hirschfeld of the National Institute of Mental Health.   Nobody really knows why, but Hirschfeld and psychiatry professorGerald Klerman, of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center,suspect major changes in the social environment that occurred sinceWorld War II, and the stress of high expectations clashing witheconomic reality.   Baby boomers are not formally defined, but Klerman applies theterm to the 76.2 million babies born from 1947 to 1965, now rangingfrom about 23 to 41 years old. They make up about a third of theUnited States population.   Births during the 16-year boom were 50 percent higher than theprevious 16 years and 16 percent above the following 16 years.   Klerman believes the size of the generation contributed tohigher depression rates, citing a theory by economist RichardEasterlin of the University of Southern California, who says thatbecause of supply and demand, a large age group will face lowerwages, higher unemployment and less upward mobility on the job thansmaller age groups.   Baby-boomers entered that situation with high materialexpectations because they grew up in relatively prosperous times.Despite the economic burden of the big generation, Easterlin said,they still aspire to material wealth by staying single, or formingfamilies with working mothers and few if any children.   ``And the result is a lot of psychological stress,'' Easterlinsaid.   But sociologist Allan Horwitz of Rutgers University saidbaby-boomers grew up in ``a very psychological climate, where theyare more attuned to looking within themselves,'' and may be moreprone to react to difficulties by become depressed. Those bornearlier may have just gotten physically sick.</TEXT><HEAD>Association Helps Sufferers of Mysterious Illness</HEAD><TEXT>   TIGARD, Ore. _ The mysterious ailment has been dubbed``Hollywood Blahs'' and ``Yuppie Disease,'' but to the thousands ofpeople debilitated by its long list of symptoms, chronic fatiguesyndrome is no joking matter.   ``Would you make fun of M.S., lupus or other disorders withsimilar hardships for patients?'' wrote Gidget Faubion-Jones,president of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Society, in a lettercomplaining about a newspaper cartoon that poked fun at sufferersand implied the ailment is psychosomatic.   ``Many of these people are wheelchair bound, have lost jobs,savings, relationships, houses and a normal lifestyle,'' she wrote.   Until recently, many doctors believed the ailment was fictional.In a March report in the Annals of Internal Medicine, 16researchers gave it credibility by naming and defining it. Thedefinition largely involves ruling out other illnesses, though, andlittle is known about the syndrome.   Its symptoms can include exhaustion, disorientation, sorethroat, depression, fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches andinsomnia.   The society, which now has 12,000 members, was founded in thisPortland suburb three years ago as a support group for localsufferers of the illness, then called chronic Epstein-Barr virussyndrome. It now is an international clearinghouse of information,sends out a newsletter, maintains what it says is the largestlibrary of information about the illness, organizes conferences anddistributes information to the public.   ``We're recognizing it (chronic fatigue syndrome) as a clinicalentity to be investigated and looked at,'' says Dr. John Stewart ofthe CDC. The Epstein-Barr virus initially was thought to cause it,but investigation dispelled that theory. The CDC's next step is a30-person study in the Atlanta area.</TEXT><HEAD>Hydrogen Coolant Offered As Antidote To Ozone-Depleting Freon</HEAD><DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Simple hydrogen could replace ozone-bustingrefrigerants in vehicle air conditioners, one of the leadingsources of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals damaging Earth'sprotective radiation shield, a researcher says.   But the refrigerant industry believes it will find an antidoteto the ozone problem without forcing society to adopt radicallydifferent technology like that being developed by Edward Wallace ofCarnegie Mellon University.   ``We're hearing a lot about new inventions coming down thepike,'' says Kevin Fay of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy.``We're not saying there aren't technological solutions out thereto be found. But the extent to which they're commercially viableand can be manufactured in millions of units is another question.''   The estimated 146,000 metric tons of U.S.-produced R-12, thetype of refrigerant used in vehicle air conditioners, accounted for45 percent of the nation's output of CFCs, Fay says. ``It's thesingle largest source of emission of R-12 in the country today.''   Wallace's air conditioner cools as hydrogen passes between twobeds of material that absorb it at different rates. One bed'sattraction to hydrogen is strong enough to pull it from the otherbed, duplicating the chilling effect of a liquid evaporating. Thestronger bed when heated gives up the hydrogen to the weaker bed,and the cycle is repeated as needed.   Hydrogen's flammability is no problem, Wallace says, becauseonly 2 percent of the hydrogen in his design is ever in its gaseousstate. The rest is locked in chemical compounds in the beds, whichare alloys of iron, nickel and rare earth elements includinglanthanum.   Similar devices are under development in Israel, Scandanavia andEurope, where the most rudimentary designs are about as efficientas conventional air conditioners. Wallace says he won't know howefficient his is until the components are assembled and tested.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for June 23</NOTE></DOC>
