nomatter how you back up your choices, there's always someone who thinks you'recrazy.andP;  When it comes to the best games, things can get even stickier --especially with games rewritten for the Macintosh.andP;  In the heyday of computergames, a game was typically developed on one platform and rolled over, moreor less unchanged, to others.andP;  The rollover technique didn't work all thatwell for the Mac.andP;  The games took little or no advantage of the Mac'sstrengths or its interface.andP;  Even now, few of the rollovers play as well asgames written especially for the Mac.andP;  Today, the best Mac games are thosethat have been developed expressly for the Mac or programs such as ChrisCrawford's Balance of Power that have been pretty thoroughly rewritten forit.andM;Graphic AdventuresandM;1 Arthur: The Quest forandM;ExcaliburandM;Mesh Infocom's excellent interactive fiction with interesting color graphics,on-screen mapping and hints, and the Arthurian legend, and you've got awinning combination.andP;  You are Arthur, son and true heir of the High King.andO;But the sword in the stone -- the symbol of your legacy -- has been stolen bythe evil King Lot.andP;  You have only three days to get it back.andP;  For die-hardtext-only players, all the special features -- graphics, hints, and mapping-- can be turned off.andP;  Requires 512K.andP;  Color supported on the Mac II series.andO;$49.95.andP;  Infocom, 3885 Bohannon Drive, Menlo Park, CA 94025; (415) 329-0800.andM;2andamp;3 Deja VuandM;Deja Vu IIandM;Probably the first game to really take advantage of the Mac's great graphicswas Deja Vu, Mindscapehs story about a hard-boiled detective in which youplay the private eye.andP;  After waking with a hang-over in a sleazy room, youspend your time trying to find out who you are, hanging around the lessupscale parts of Chicago and going through people's pockets.andP;  Deja Vu II, theLas Vegas version, is also worth looking at.andP;  You play the same character,equally hung over at the start, but this time you've been abducted by themob.andP;  Requires 512K.andP;  $ 49.95 each.andP;  Mindscape, 3444 Dundee Road, Northbrook,IL 60062; (312) 480-7667.andM;4andamp;5 ShadowgateandM;UninvitedandM;If your taste runs more to quests, monsters, and archaic weaponry, take alook at Shadowgate and Uninvited, also from Mindscape.andP;  Both programs havegood puzzles, some well-used animation, and a mocking sense of humor.andP;  Manyways to die are included at no extra cost.andP;  Requires 512K.andP;  $49.95 each.andO;Mindscape, 3444 Dundee Road, Northbrook, IL 60062; (312) 480-7667.andM;Arcade-Type/andM;Board GamesandM;6 ArkanoidandM;Arkanoid is one of the more successful translations from the coin-op arcades,even though it doesn't have color.andP;  The game resembles a combination of Pongand Breakout: You move a paddle across the bottom of the screen, bouncing aball into various &quot;brick&quot; configurations.andP;  The goal is to clear each screen(except for the impervious bricks).andP;  When hit, some of the bricks turn intospheroids with cryptic letters on them, which when caught give temporary butwelcome powers (such as being able to blast away or slow the game down).andO;Arkanoid is mysteriously addictive, and some of the higher-level screens havea high frustration component; you'll feel virtually omnipotent when youfinally clear them.andP;  $49.95.andP;  Discovery Software, 163 Conduit St., Annapolis,MD 21401; (301) 268-9877.andM;7 Crystal QuestandM;Crystal Quest was probably the first true arcade-type game designedespecially for the Mac.andP;  The latest version of Crystal Quest (with CritterEditor) has removed the copy protection and added the ability to create yourown monsters and digitized sound.andP;  You can also adjust the scoring, but yourisk the contempt of game purists by doing so.andP;  Play is straightforward:Shoot the bad guys, pick up the &quot;treasures&quot; (smart bombs and extra points),and stay alive.andP;  All versions run in color if you have the necessaryhardware.andP;  $49.95.andP;  Casady andamp; Greene, P.O. Box 261430, Carmel, CA 93922; (408)624-8716.andM;8andamp;9 Dark CastleandM;Beyond Dark CastleandM;Dark Castle is an excellent Mac action game in which you have to leap, swing,creep, and brandish various weapons on your way to fortune or ignominiousdeath.andP;  The sequel, Beyond Dark Castle, is not quite as good, chiefly becausethe game play doesn't introduce anything new, but if you like the firstiteration, the second is a good deal.andP;  Requires 512K.andP;  $49.95 each.andP;  SiliconBeach Software, Inc., 9770 Carroll Center Road, Suite J, San Diego, CA 92126;(619) 695-6956.andM;10 KlondikeandM;Klondike is a wonderful solitaire card game.andP;  You can choose to turn overthree cards or one card at a time, you get points for cards played, andyou're penalized two points for every 15 seconds that you hesitate.andP;  You canbrush up on the casino version of solitaire too: $52 for the deck and $5 forevery card built up on the aces.andP;  Klondike is a straightforward simulation ofreal solitaire, which may not sound like much to get excited about; however,this is an elegantly designed and realized program.andP;  You even get color suitson the Mac II.andP;  $10 (shareware).andP;  Unison Software, 675 Almanor Ave.,andO;Sunnyvale, CA 94086; (408) 245-3000.andM;Text AdventuresandM;The all-time-best text adventures have come from Infocom (now part ofMediagenic).andP;  Their main components are excellent plots and puzzles and awacky sense of humor, all of which have translated intact to every kind ofcomputer from mainframe to Kaypro.andP;  To summarize the plots and action wouldbe an article in iteself, and there are so many that we're going to take themmore or less together.andM;11andamp;12 ZorkandM;Beyond ZorkandM;If swords and sorcery are your true metier, work your way through the Zorktrilogy, the great-granddaddy of interactive text adventures.andP;  That plus thesequel, Beyond Zork, should keep you busy for a while.andM;13 PlanetfallandM;If you're only happy with a laser in your hand and the feel of a starshipdeck beneath your feet, try Planetfall, a personal favorite of at least oneMacUser editor.andM;14 The Hitchhiker'sandM;Guide to the GalaxyandM;If you're a Douglas Adams fan, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy isavailable on-disk too, but reading the books won't help you much past thedestruction of Earth.andM;15 Leather GoddessesandM;of PhobosandM;You'll also want to take a look at Leather Goddesses of Phobos, notable asthe first game to have an &quot;adult&quot; playing level and scratch-and-sniff cards.andM;All require 512K.andP;  $19.95 each.andP;  Infocom, 3885 Bohannon Drive, Menlo Park, CA94025; (415) 329-0800.andM;16 ShanghaiandM;Shanghai, a well-known addiction among Mac game players, is a board gameusing mah-jongg pieces that are laid out in the &quot;dragon&quot; pattern (squint;it'll come to you).andP;  The goal is to clear the board of pieces, which evokesan animated dragon.andP;  The game's outcome is a nicely balanced function of luckand strategy.andP;  Version 2 adds 3-D color with sound on the Mac II, but the 3-Dtakes a little getting used to.andP;  Another welcome new feature:  The programinforms you when you've run out of moves, instead of letting you flounderabout.andP;  In either version, you can always get help finding a -- but notnecessarily the best -- move.andP;  $49.95.andP;  Activision, 3885 Bohannon Drive,Menlo Park, CA 94025; (415) 329-0800.andM;17 TetrisandM;Tetris is a multilevel strategy game that requires an advanced sense ofspatial relationships.andP;  (If you blew the grammar-school test that asks you toduplicate printed patterns with little blocks, try another game listed here.)andO;In this game, you're not so much concerned with clearing the screens as withmaking sure they don't fill up.andP;  Pieces of various shapes drop from the topof the screen and are manipulated into place from the keyboard or number pad.andO;Your job is to keep filling out rows so they disappear; if the screen fills,the game's over.andP;  Tetris is one of the clear benefits of glasnost, it comesto us from the Soviet Union via Spectrum Holobyte.andP;  $49.95.andP;  SpectrumHolobyte, 2061 Challenger Drive, Alameda, CA 94501; (415) 522-3584.andM;SimulationsandM;18 FalconandM;This is not one of your sedate flight simulators that lets you experience thedubious thrill of tooling around the sky in a small airplane, looking forO'Hare.andP;  Falcon slams you into the cockpit of an F-16 and then startsthrowing MiGs and missiles at you.andP;  Think of it as getting as close as mostof us ever will to being Top Gun.andP;  The realism of this game, from thestandpoint of what you find in the cockpit and how the plane maneuvers andhandles, has even been commented on in Washington, D.C.andP;  Falcon combines anexcellent simulation with the joy of blasting bad guys out of the air.andO;$49.95.andP;  Spectrum Holobyte, 2061 Challenger Drive, Alameda, CA 94501; (415)522-3584.andM;19 Life andamp; DeathandM;In this intriguing simulation, you become a surgeon at Toolworks General,diagnosing patients, reading charts, ordering X-rays and ultrasounds, andperforming other lab work.andP;  You also get the chance to perform appendectomiesand aneurysm grafts.andP;  Be prepared to make a lot of mistakes and to learn fromthem -- the program has an excellent teaching algorithm that instructs you onthe proper medical procedures each time you mess up.andP;  One word of caution: There's at least one mistake in the description of the surgical technique forappendectomies -- sew the drawstring suture before you place the clamps onthe appendix.andP;  (You'll know what we mean when you get there.)andP;  $49.95.andP;  TheSoftware Toolworks, 19808 Nordhoff Place, Chatsworth, CA 91311; (818)885-9000.andM;MiscellaneousandM;20 Balance of Power 1990andM;Balance of Power is a geopolitical strategy game in which you try to increaseyour country's prestige while keeping the Soviet Union in second place(something like the real world).andP;  Unlike the real world, however, theultimate goal is peace and prosperity -- resort to the nuclear alternative,and you lose.andP;  The latest version has been updated to include 18 morecountries; a crisis advisory; a fourth, &quot;multipolar&quot; level; and a featurethat allows you to discourage smaller countries from injudicious behavior.andO;Pursuing international popularity, making or buying alliances, andoverthrowing the uncooperative take time; you may be wrapped up in this onefor a while.andP;  Be sure to brush off those old poli-sci textbooks, and rememberthat power is an addictive substance.andP;  Not MultiFinder compatible.andP;  $49.95.andO;Mindscape, 3444 Dundee Road, Northbrook, IL 60062; (312) 480-7667.andM;SportsandM;21 MacGolfandM;MacGolf is an old-timer in the Mac-games market; we first reviewed it in theMay '86 issue.andP;  It's a straightforward multiplayer golf simulation withdigitized sound, excellent graphics, and a selection of courses.andP;  Those inthe know (people who actually play golf) claim that this is just about asclose to the real thing as you can get without hiring a caddy.andP;  (At least oneMacUser staffer has upped the computer-literacy quotient of her entire familyby sending a copy of MacGolf home.)andP;  $59.95.andP;  XOR Corp., 7607 Bush Lake Road,Minneapolis, MN 55435; (612) 831-0444.andM;22 Shufflepuck CafeandM;Your goal is to get to at telephone so that you can fix your new NashSombrero (which blew a capacitor on the way to close the biggest sale of yourcareer).andP;  The only things in your way are some galactic misfits and a few&quot;friendly&quot; games of Shufflepuck, Broderbund's electronic version of airhockey.andM;You're pitted against eight different opponents, each with a uniquepersonality and style of play.andP;  Paddle size, bounce, and power areadjustable, and you can add obstacles from the Blocker menu.andP;  A slightlybattered droid acts as a trainer, and once you feel up to it, you can try theTournament level.andP;

 The graphics are based on the traditional tarot deck,and the puzzles are varied: jigsaw puzzles, anagrams, cryptograms, mazes, andothers that require a high level of manual dexterity.andP;  After you have solvedall 80 puzzles, you still have to untangle the secret of The Sun's Map.andP;  Youmay spend many late nights on this game -- but it's well worth it.andP;  Requires512K.andP;  $49.95.andP;  Miles Computing, 7741 Alabama Ave., Canoga Park, CA 91304;(818) 340-6300.andM;24 NetTrek:  The RealandM;VersionandM;NetTrek was one of the first Mac games designed to be played over a network.andO;The game lets up to six players on a network (two per serialized copy) roamaround outer space and blast each other into the void.andP;

 $59.95.andP;  Premier Software,1411 209th Ave. N.E., Redmond, WA 98053; (206) 868-6360.andM;25 Where in the World IsandM;Carmen Sandiego?andM;26 Where in Europe IsandM;Carmen Sandiego?andM;These two programs are rare: &quot;educational games&quot; that are equally good inboth respects.andP;  In both you're a detective with a series of crimes to solvethat take you, in the first instance, all over the world and, in the sequel,jaunting around Europe.andP;  The crimes are a little goofy: All the chocolate inHolland has been stolen, and Hamlet's castle has been stolen by a masked man.andO;You are given a certain number of days to solve the crime, and the programautomatically deducts sleep and flight time (you spend a lot of time atairports).andP;  Broderbund provides a world almanac and a small but sufficientRand McNally atlas of Europe to help you unravel clues.andM;You investigate the scene and interrogate witnesses to find clues, which areoften in the form of, &quot;He said he was going to a country whose flag is green,black, and yellow.&quot;andP;  Or, &quot;She said she was going to a country bordered byseven other countries.&quot;andM;You also get the occasional prosaic clue, such as the criminal's hair coloror taste in books or movies.andP;

is definitelyworth looking at.andP;  This program lets anyone with enough imagination designand program a fantasy adventure game.andM;After you have produced a map of your world, designed your scenes, andpopulated your world with persons, monster, and things, you write the programcode that defines how the game works.andP;  Much of the code is already taken careof for you, and the rest is pretty easy to do.andP;  Sound effects can also beincluded in the game.andP;  Requires 512K.andP;  $79.95.andP;  Silicon Beach Software, 9770Carroll Center Road, Suite J, San Diego, CA 92126;
