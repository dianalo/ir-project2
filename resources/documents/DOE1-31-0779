In orderto study the magnetic fluctuations of Fe/sup 2+/ spin of this material,the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time, T/sub 1/, of /sup 133/Cs ismeasured mainly at 4.2 K, i.e., at the paramagnetic phase, under theapplied magnetic field up to 15 T. A drastic decrease of T/sub 1/ aroundB/sub x/ is observed. We propose a new mechanism of T/sub 1/ inherentin the level crossing based on the direct flip process between the nuclearspin and the exchange broadened electron spin system.</TEXT></DOC>
