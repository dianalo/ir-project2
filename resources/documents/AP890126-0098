The diplomats, who demanded anonymity, quoted reports from Kabulas saying that ``after bombing of north and south ends of Salangtunnel, Soviet and Afghan artillery obliterated all dwellings andvillages south of the tunnel.''   They quoted Afghan sources, including an eyewitnesss report, assaying the raids occurred Monday at the Salang tunnel on the mainhighway, which connects Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.   ``Soviet forces and Afghan Special Guard committed a majoratrocity in Salang area on Monday,'' the diplomats said.``Reportedly, hundreds of civilians were killed.''   ``According to eyewitnesses, no dwellings remain,'' they said.   A dispatch received from Western diplomats in Kabul saidwitnesses reported seeing ``Soviet tanks rolling over dead bodies ofvictims of Salang road.''   The dispatch said the account of destruction of all dwellingscame from three separate sources, including one diplomat who is anoutspoken defender of Afghan President Najib.   Also today, Afghanistan's state-run Radio Kabul said 206guerrillas were killed in two days of fighting in the easternprovince of Parwan. It said 109 more rebels were killed in a clashin the southeastern city of Kandahar today.   The radio, monitored in Islamabad, gave no other details.   The report came the same day Moslem insurgents said they hadstepped up attacks on Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city,because the Soviets were airlifting tons of arms and ammunition toprop up government forces there.   The Afghan News Agency, run by the hard-line Hezb-i-Islamiguerrilla group, said Soviet aircraft were bombarding rebelpositions around the city.   ``The situation in Kandahar is speedily taking a turn for theworse and the Russian planeloads of sophisticated armaments are onthe increase,'' it said.   The news agency claimed the airlift was meant to prevent the fallof the city to the guerrillas, or ``holy warriors,'' before Feb. 15,the deadline for the Red Army's withdrawal from Afghanistan.   ``The Afghan mujahedeen around Kandahar have escalated theircombined attacks on the airport ... with a view to blocking the soleSoviet military supply line so as to tighten the economic blockadeof the city,'' it reported.   Other guerrilla sources claimed rebels downed two helicopterswith anti-aircraft guns Jan. 19 during an attack on Kandahar'sairport.   There was no independent confirmation of that action, but Westerndiplomats and travelers have backed up reports of increased fightingaround the city, which remains under communist control.   Radio Kabul on Wednesday reported the killing of more than 700rebels in recent fighting. Non-communist observers usually describesuch high casualty counts as exaggerated.   Western diplomats in Islamabad claim Radio Kabul has broadcastseveral false reports of communist victories to boost the morale ofgovernment forces who the diplomats say are increasingly nervous atthe prospect of facing the well-armed mujahedeen alone after theSoviets leave.   The radio repeatedly has broadcast reports of killings ofAmerican, Pakistani and other ``foreign advisers'' in Afghanistan.   Washington and Islamabad, who back the rebels, have denied havinganyone but embassy staff in Afghanistan.   Moscow agreed in last year's U.N.-sponsored accord to end itsnine-year military involvement in the Afghan war by Feb. 15.   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized powerin a 1978 military coup. Soviet forces intervened in December 1979to replace one pro-Moscow government with another and about 115,000Red Arny troops stayed on to help it fight a growing insurgency.   Western diplomats say the final phase of the pullout is in fullswing. They have predicted that most Soviet combat units will be outof the country by the end of January. Half had left by Aug. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
