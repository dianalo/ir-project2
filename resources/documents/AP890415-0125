(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA has selected April 28 as datefor launching Atlantis on the first space shuttle planetary missionwith the Magellan-Venus probe.   The decision was announced Friday following a comprehensivetwo-day review of all aspects of the flight by more than 200shuttle managers and engineers. Liftoff of the shuttle Atlantis wasset for 2:24 p.m. EDT.   ``While we have much work to do, and little contingency time, wehave established an April 28 launch date,'' NASA shuttle DirectorRichard Truly said.   That had been the unofficial launch target for several weeks.   During their four-day flight, Atlantis' five astronauts are torelease the $378 million Magellan spacecraft from the cargo bay,starting it on a 466-day journey to Venus.   The spacecraft is to orbit the cloud-covered planet in August1990 and map its surface over the next 243 days with ahigh-resolution radar system.   Magellan is the first new American planetary spacecraft sincePioneer 13 was launched in 1978, also to Venus. It also is thefirst planetary payload to be carried by a space shuttle.   ``The goal of Magellan is to obtain radar images of at least 70percent of the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan projectscientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.   The radar is intended to produce images showing features assmall as 150 feet across. In comparison, Pioneer 13 could notdistinguish features any smaller than 60 miles across.   Saunders said the images would help scientists understand howVenus was formed and might provide answers to the puzzling questionof how Earth and Venus, with a surface temperature of 900 degreesFahrenheit, evolved so differently even though at the beginning ofthe solar system 4.8 billion years ago they were almost identical.   He said the Magellan pictures might answer questions about theextent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether Venusonce had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal platessimiliar to those on Earth.   Commanding the astronaut crew is veteran shuttle pilot DavidWalker. The others are pilot Ron Grabe and mission specialists MaryCleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard.</TEXT></DOC>
