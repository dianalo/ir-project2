The memo, written by the staff of the Feed Materials ProductionCenter at Fernald, Ohio, said a study by plant operators in 1961found emissions of up to 1,000 pounds each month that year _possibly 12,000 pounds _ from Fernald's Plant 8.   That total is nearly 24 times the U.S. Department of Energy'sestimate of 462 pounds of uranium emissions from Plant 8 in 1961.   The memo's discovery follows the government's admission inOctober that the complex had released 54,000 more pounds of uraniumthan its estimates showed _ after those estimates already had beenrevised upward in 1985, 1986 and 1987.   Lawyers representing Fernald-area residents said Friday theyfound the memo among 30,000 documents submitted by the federalgoverment.   ``This is a truly extraordinary document,'' said Arjun Makhijani,a Maryland environmental scientist. His 1987 study of Fernaldemissions concluded that government reports severely underestimatedthe problem.   The memo was written by the engineering staff of National Lead ofOhio, the plant's operator from 1951 through 1985, as part of aninternal investigation of unexplained losses of uranium from onepart of the complex.   The plant, which National Lead operated under contract with thefederal government, processes uranium for the U.S. nuclear weaponsprogram.   U.S. Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said he would hold morecongressional hearings on the plant because of the discrepancybetween the newly discovered data and the most recent federalfigures.   James Reafsnyder, DOE site manager at Fernald since 1985, saidthe memo's numbers may be included in revised estimates that will bereleased in the next few months. He declined to comment on the memo.</TEXT></DOC>
