In its monthly statistical report for December, theindustry trade group said that production went into a&quot;substantial and largely unanticipated&quot; decline late lastyear after having largely stabilized during the latter halfof 1990 and the first half of 1991. Total U.S. output iscurrently declining at an annual rate of 300,000 barrels aday, the group estimated.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The evidence indicates that the exploration andproduction sectors of the petroleum industry in the U.S. haveentered a period of accelerated decline, while there isaccelerated growth overseas,&quot; Edward Murphy, the group'sdirector of finance, accounting and statistics, told a newsconference.   The report said oil imports fell last year, as a result ofweak domestic demand and the stabilization in domestic outputearly in the year. Imports' share of U.S. demand fell to45.5% last year from 47% in 1990, the first annual declinesince 1983. Even here, however, the group found cause forconcern, pointing out that demand for imports rose in thesecond half of the year. Indeed, Mr. Murphy predicted thatimports' share would break the 1977 record of 47.7% if theeconomy picks up steam this year or the domestic outputdeteriorates further.   Overall demand for petroleum products fell 2% to16,648,000 barrels a day in 1991 from 16,989,000 barrels in1990, the API said, citing high prices related to the PersianGulf War early in the year and the recession.   Oil's share of energy consumption continued to fall lastyear, declining to 40.3%. The level hasn't been that lowsince 1950, and it hasn't been lower since 1949, when oilmade up 39% of energy consumption. After hitting a peak of48.7% in 1977, oil's share has fallen as a result of improvedvehicle fuel efficiency, conservation and switching tonatural gas or other fuels by electric utilities and otherindustries.   Mr. Murphy said the output picture wouldn't brightenunless the oil industry wins greater access to public landssuch as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska andcertain offshore areas. A bid to open a portion of the refugefailed in the Senate last year, however, and the industryisn't likely to have much more success this year.   Independent producers in particular are also seeking tochange provisions in the federal alternative minimum tax thatthey contend discourage investment in exploration anddrilling.   Oil output in the lower 48 states last year declined to5.6 million barrels a day, the lowest level since 5.4 millionbarrels a day in 1950.</TEXT></DOC>
