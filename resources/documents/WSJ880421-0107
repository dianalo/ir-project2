Prices of North Sea Brent in Europe traded 25 cents lower, at $16.80 a barrel, late yesterday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the expiring May-delivery contract for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, closed at $17.74, down 29 cents. The contract fell 49 cents the day before.    From its peak on Monday, when Persian Gulf fighting between the U.S. Navy and Iran energized an already bullish market, West Texas Intermediate on Nymex has tumbled $1.18 a barrel. The price slide was overdue, analysts said.    The market &quot;was really, really stretched out. All the indicators showed that it was extremely overbought,&quot; said Shahrokh Nikkhah, vice president, futures, at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., who studies technical factors driving the energy markets.    Several market watchers said prices might fall an additional 50 cents a barrel, but probably not more, ahead of next Tuesday's meeting of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and several non-OPEC exporters. Anticipation about that meeting had boosted oil prices about $2 a barrel the past two weeks.    By Monday morning, traders &quot;had every positive news that could happen,&quot; Mr. Nikkhah said, referring to the announced OPEC meeting and the U.S.-Iran fighting.    A timing factor added to the size of the sell-off these past two days. An unusually large number of oil traders had held on to their May contracts, which expired at the end of trading yesterday, in case the Persian Gulf situation got worse. When that didn't happen, those traders began selling their contracts in droves. &quot;The correction of the past two days was exacerbated because a lot of Mays overstayed their welcome,&quot; said Mr. Nikkhah.    Dennis K. Winters, senior economist at DRI Energy in Lexington, Mass., a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said: &quot;There was a lot of hype in the market. That was pretty much what it amounted to.&quot; He said more traders realize there is little chance that developments at next week's OPEC meeting could boost prices much higher than they already are.    &quot;The market is finally beginning to trade in the world of reality as we approach the OPEC meeting,&quot; said Peter I. Cardillo, commodity trading adviser at Josephthal andamp; Co., a New York brokerage firm.    Meanwhile, more oil companies responded to price rises earlier this week by raising the price they will pay for West Texas Intermediate $1 a barrel, to $17.50 a barrel. But Amoco Corp. and Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, each raised their prices only 50 cents, to $17.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Futures prices finished mixed in a quiet session. Wheat prices edged up as concerns about dryness in the northern Plains were alleviated a bit. The wheat contract for December settlement rose one cent to $3.425 a bushel. Meanwhile, corn and soybean futures finished lower. Meal was the weak link in the soybean complex, as slack export demand hurt that market. A continued good harvest of Brazil's soybean crop also was a negative factor in the day's trading.    COPPER: Futures prices fell for the third consecutive session in response to an apparent increase in copper supplies. May delivery copper declined 2.70 cents a pound to 92.20 cents, for a cumulative loss so far this week of 6.10 cents. According to Fred Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York, both production and producers' stocks of copper have risen recently. According to the American Bureau of Metal Statistics, he said, U.S. mine production of the metal during January and February rose 21% from a year earlier, while world output was up 13% at the end of January from a year before. Producer stocks of copper since last October have increased by 7,700 tons through February in the U.S., and by 30,500 tons through January world-wide, he said, citing bureau statistics. Another factor contributing to the perception of growing supplies, a trade source noted, is that Chile has been a seller of a significant quantity of copper over the past three months in the world market. This copper originally had been earmarked for Brazil, which hasn't issued import licenses because of balance-of-payment problems. Thus, the metal has become available for sale elsewhere, the source said. Yesterday's drop was intensified by technical selling, added Mr. Demler of Drexel. This selling developed after the May contract fell below the key support level of 92.50 cents to as low as 91.60 cents at one point.    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices seesawed from the plus to minus column in relatively light trading. The bellwether Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures for June settlement closed fractionally higher at 257.90, after hitting a high of 258.90 and a low of 256.10. A 0.5% jump in consumer prices for March, reported yesterday morning, had little impact on the market. Traders said widespread rumors late Tuesday had predicted an increase of as much as 0.9%, so traders said they were prepared for the higher than expected number. A small amount of arbitrage-related trading between stocks and stock-index futures late in the day also had little impact on prices. </TEXT></DOC>
