 The main criterion fora first data base should be the user interface, not whether thedata base is flat file or relational.andP;  Differences in the userinterface are what make up the competitive advantage of most databases.andP;  Not every data base system is appropriate for everyapplication.andP;  Claris' FileMaker II is the best forms-baseddatabase.andP;  It is also extremely suitable for basic andintermediate-level activities.andP;  It does not suitable for complex,stand-alone applications.andP;  ACIUS' 4th Dimension has the mostnearly complete data base development environment.andP;  It is suitablefor medium-duty and large data base applications, particularlygeneralized transaction processing.andP;

 relational myth DATABASES SEEM like pretty simplepropositions.andP;  They store data in some organized way so that it can be easilyretrieved when you need it, in the form you need it in.andP;  But if they are sosimple, why are there dozens to choose from on the Macintosh?andP;  Are therereally that many different ways to organize, store and retrieve data?andM;Maybe.andP;  For one thing, the Mac has fostered databases that store images,sounds, CAD files, even full-motion video as well as text.andM;No matter what database you opt for now, you're not obligated to thatsoftware forever.andP;  There's no reason you can't transfer your existing filesto a new system that may come along later.andP;  That's one of the Mac'sstrengths.andM;Macintosh text-based databases can almost be classified into the familiarflat file and relational variants.andP;  Almost.andP;  Although the distinction betweenflat file and relational is important, the fact that a database organizesdata into a single file or through interconnected multiple files shouldn't begermane to your initial database decision.andP;  What should be important is theinterface.andM;I'm always amazed how often we Mac managers forget the importance ofsoftware.andP;  Perhaps we take it for granted that all Macintosh products areeasy to use by virtue of their &quot;Macness.&quot;andP;  If that's the case, how do youexplain database aberrations like DMacIII or Omnis II?andP;  Pick the wronginterface, and you'll suffer.andP;  And so will your staff.andM;It's the subtleties of the interface that constitute the competitiveadvantage of many databases.andP;  Think about how different it is to use dBASEIII on a PC compared with dBASE Mac.andP;  While both of these Ashton-Tateproducts can be categorized as relational databases, they sure don't workalike.andP;  Users of one system don't necessarily have any skills that can betransferred to another.andM;Another problem with the flat file/relational dichotomy is that some vendorswould have you believe it's the only important distinction among Macdatabases.andP;  Some vendors will even tell you that by their very nature, flatfile databases are less powerful than relational ones, but always easier touse, while relational databases are always harder to use and more powerful.andM;Baloney.andM;If you manage to resist the urgent fall into the database dichotomy trap, youwill be surprised just how different database products are in enabling aspecific kind of application.andM;I've already made the database selection search and adopted (for myself andmy clients) Claris' FileMaker II, ACIUS' 4th Dimension and Fox Software'sFoxBASE+/Mac.andM;I happen to think that FileMaker II is just about the slickest forms-baseddatabase I've ever used.andP;  It also happens that FileMaker II's competence andfeatures make it ideal for a number of basic and intermediate-level databasechores, like customer invoicing for a small businesses.andM;Still, as good as FileMaker II is at database forms, it's weak at largerduties, or those that will grow beyond basic systems.andP;  For example, if youneed to build a complex, stand-alone application that will use lots ofdifferent kinds of data from different kinds of computers, then FileMaker isinappropriate.andP;  It's simply not designed to manipulate multiple filestructures well.andM;For medium-duty and larger database applications, such as point-of-salesystems or almost any kind of generalized transaction processing, I use 4thDimension.andP;  Yes, I know that Version 1.1 is slow.andP;  But Version 2.0 will bemuch faster, and 4D has plenty of tricks you can employ to keep 1.1performance acceptable.andP;  The fact is that despite its performance problems,4D offers just about the most complete database development environmentavailable anywhere.andM;For truly large database systems (more than 20,000 records), my choice hasbeen FoxBASE+/MAC.andP;  FoxBASE has consistently proved itself the fastestMacintosh database in a number of standard benchmarks and in general usagetests.andP;  While FoxBASE doesn't have all the development goodies that make 4Dso interesting, it does come with a set of strong utilities that make it agood database application development product.andM;In later columns, I will explore some of the issues raised here in greaterdetail.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
