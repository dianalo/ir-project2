Specific objectivesinclude the determination of the high temperature thermal stability ofa suite of model compounds typical of those present as trace contaminantsin the fuel, investigation of the thermal ability of various fractionsof a coal-derived and a petroleum-derived JP-8 jet fuel, the determinationof the thermal; stability of the unfractionated fuels, and the developmentof the relationship between the stability of the whole material and thebehavior of model compounds of fuel fractions. Six model compounds (phenols)and 1-naphthol have been heat treated at temperatures ranging from 250to 400{degree}C for 1--4 hours. Experiments were carried out using themicroautoclave reactors. An initial cold nitrogen pressure of 100 psiginstead of 500 psig was employed for high-temperature reactions. Someof the thermal treatments at 300, 350 and 400{degree}C have led to distinctchanges in the appearance of the starting materials, forming homogeneousliquids from solid compounds in certain cases. Observations are summarized.2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
