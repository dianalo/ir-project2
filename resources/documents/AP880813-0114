Bush, his own nomination set for Wednesday night, was said byone source to have narrowed the list of vice presidential prospectsto a half dozen or so names. ``I'm not saying whom I'm going to runwith,'' was the vice president's comment in an interview with CableNews Network.   The roster was said to include two former rivals for the GOPnomination, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Jack Kemp of New York. Alsoin the running were Dole's wife, Elizabeth, Sens. Dan Quayle ofIndiana, Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Alan Simpson of Wyoming,as well as at least one or two others.   One party source put former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander onthe list.   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis interrupted aweekend on Cape Cod for a news conference that included a tributeto Bush's ``enormous courage and tremendous patriotism.'' A dayearlier, Bush's account of being shot down in World War II wasquestioned by a gunner who witnessed the episode.   At the same time, he renewed his attack on Reaganadministration's ``irresponsible fiscal policy'' in the wake oflast week's jump in interest rates.   With Bush in Washington pondering his choices and polishing hisacceptance speech, Republicans spent the pre-convention weekendlighting up the social circuit.   There were 500 separate convention-related receptions,breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, brunches and cocktail parties onthe docket for the week by rough count, not to mention the touristattractions that make New Orleans famous.   ``We had a few delegates come in. They had their badges on,''said Manny Moreland, the doorman at a club in the fabled FrenchQuarter where female impersonators dance nearly naked. ``From NewYork. Good tippers.''   A youthful Republican balloon squad worked overtime inflatingenough red, white and blue balloons for next week's celebration.   Construction crews put the finishing touches on the Superdomepodium where Bush will stand to deliver his acceptance speech nextThursday night.   Police reported that 25 groups had signed up to stage protestsin a designated area several blocks from the convention arena. Thelist ran the gamut from self-proclaimed anarchists to marijuanasmokers to advocates from the homeless.   Local politicians worked to take advantage of the publicityglare focused on New Orleans. Democratic Mayor Sidney J. Barthemeysaid he hoped ``people will leave here and will have a positiveview of the city if they already didn't have one.''   The vice presidential guessing game was the only suspense at theGOP convention, and one Bush aide said the campaign would ``startfloating a lot of trial balloons, starting Monday. The rumor millis going to be fantastic,'' said Steve Schwartz, executive directorof the North Carolina campaign organization.   Already the speculation had drifted into sarcasm-land. OneRepublican showed off a ``Bush-Rather'' button, as if Bush mightpick the CBS anchorman with whom he had an on-air showdown duringthe primary season.   With Bush several hundred miles away in Washington, theRepublican high command worked the convention city.   Campaign manager Lee Atwater, dismissing a suggestion thatPresident Reagan would overshadow the vice president at the week'sconvention, said, ``The fact of the matter is, George Bush is nowfront and center stage, he's the candidate for president, he's theman people are going to be watching.''   Reagan, who speaks to the convention on Monday night, said inhis weekly radio address that he will campaign for the vicepresident this fall because of ``my love for America and my dreamsfor her future.''   ``Some in the other party are parading around the country,talking and talking about what they claim they'd do if they wereelected. Well, while they talk, we deliver,'' he said.   Republican chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said the party hoped tomaintain the interest of the prime time audience throughout theweek. The convention will be a success, he said, ``If we canmaintain a program that keeps the American people watching to anextent greater than the Democrats had and we get out thosemessages, a comparison of what it was like, what the Democrats arereally all about with Michael Dukakis and our vision for thefuture.''   Roughing up Dukakis was on the agenda, as well. MassachusettsRepublicans were coming to town with a videotape attacking theDemocratic candidate. ``He talks about things, puts a nice spin onthem, but the facts are quite different,'' said Ray Shamie, head ofthe state party.   Democrats were doing a little roughing up of their own. Vicepresidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen called the Republican Partyplatform a ``repeat of broken promises'' from the eight years ofthe Reagan administration.   Campaigning in Kingsville in his home state of Texas, Bentsensaid, ``They've got a balanced budget amendment in that platform _a balanced budget amendment. Remember that in 1980, they had it in'84.   ``And they haven't submitted a balanced budget yet to the UnitedStates Congress. Not yet, not one,'' he said.  </TEXT></DOC>
