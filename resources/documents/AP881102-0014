The ``U.N. World Population Chart _ 1988'' predicts that 25 yearsinto the third millennium Nigeria will have 301.3 million people,surpassing the United States' 300.7 million.   The west-central African nation was the world's 10th mostpopulous in 1985, with 95.1 million people.   Undersecretary-general Rafeeuddin Ahmad, introducing the study ata news conference Tuesday, said Africa's population is growingfaster than that of any other continent:   ``The populations of Asia and Latin America are growing moremoderately than Africa's, and of course in many countries in Europe,the population growth is almost stationary.   ``Each woman in the world has, on the average, 3.4 children. Thatis the total fertility rate. The number for Africa is 6.2, and it isaround 3.5 in Latin America and Asia,'' he said.   Kenya and Rwanda have fertility rates of more than eight childrenper woman, according to the chart.   ``In contrast, women in Europe and North America have 1.7 to 1.8children, a number not sufficient to replace the existing populationin the long run,'' Ahmad said.   He said Africa's high birth rate offsets a life expectancy ofonly 52 years, compared with an average of 60 for developingcountries as a whole and 73 for industrialized nations.   ``Aging is bound to become a very important issue in governmentsboth in the developed and developing countries in coming years,''said Ahmad.   By the year 2025, China will have an estimated 1.49 billionpeople, and India 1.44 billion. The Soviet Union is expected to have351.4 million.   The 6th through 10th most populous nations in 2025 are expectedto be Pakistan, with 267 million; Indonesia, 257.7 million; Brazil,245.8 million; Bangladesh, 234. 9 million; and Mexico, with 150million people.   Currently, West Germany, Italy, Britain, France, and Spain rankin the 25 most populous countries. By 2025, France is expected to bethe only West European nation in the top 25, holding the 24th rankwith 60.4 million people.   The world's population was 5.1 billion in mid-1988 and will reach6 billion in 1998. By 2025, it is expected to hit 8.46 billion.   Population has been growing at a rate of about 1.7 percent sincethe mid-1970s, a rate that will remain steady until the mid-1990s,then steadily decline to below 1 percent by 2025, said Ahmad.   The Population Division of the U.N. Department of InternationalEconomic and Social Affairs prepared the data for the chart.</TEXT></DOC>
