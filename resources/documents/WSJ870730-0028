The restitution is to be $12,232,400 to Citicorp's Citibank; $781,739 to Pan American Banks of Miami, now a unit of NCNB Corp.; and $100,000 to Barnett Bank of Palm Beach County, a unit of Barnett Banks Inc.    The charges contended that under various names Mr. Roggio, 44 years old, misstated who was signing loan documents and guarantees, and overstated assets and understated liabilities in personal financial statements.    The scheme involved obtaining loans in the names of Mr. Roggio, J. Lynn Helms, the former Federal Aviation Administration head, and the business ventures of the two men. According to materials presented in court, Mr. Helms's signature was fraudulently affixed to loan documents. Mr. Helms resigned his post during investigations of his business dealings, but he wasn't criminally charged in the case.    Mr. Roggio was convicted of seven felonies after a 10-week jury trial in which he represented himself. In two indictments, he was charged with three counts of mail fraud and four counts of false statements to federally insured lending institutions. </TEXT></DOC>
