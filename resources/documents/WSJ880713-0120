After completing its midyear review, the Bartlesville, Okla., integrated oil company said it will boost 1988 spending to $950 million from the $825 million it had budgeted in the beginning of the year.    Despite a roughly $3-a-barrel drop in the price of oil since January, Phillips said most of the spending increase will go to exploration and development projects.    Other major oil companies said they didn't have any midyear plans to increase their 1988 budgets. A spokeswoman for Chevron Corp., San Francisco, said the company is sticking with its $3.2 billion spending forecast. She added that through the first quarter, the company spent 22% of its budget, in line with normal spending patterns.    In Chicago, an Amoco Corp. spokesman said, &quot;We don't plan a midcourse correction.&quot; A spokesman for Exxon Corp. in New York and a spokeswoman for Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co., Houston, declined to comment, saying they wouldn't make any spending announcements until the companies release secondquarter earnings.    A spokeswoman for Texaco Inc. in White Plains, N.Y., said the company was leaving unchanged its plans to increase 1988 spending about 10% above last year's $2.2 billion. In New York, a Mobil Corp. spokesman said company officials weren't available for comment.    While other major oil companies reduced spending after the 1986 energy-price collapse, Phillips's capital spending has also been constrained by the company's massive restructuring. &quot;We've always enjoyed more opportunities than we have had funds to finance,&quot; Bill M. Thompson, senior vice president, planning and technology, said in an interview.    Phillips is spending more even in the face of lower oil prices because the company has slashed costs and increased efficiency to the point that it can make profits at today's depressed oil and natural-gas prices.    But the company's increased funds will go largely to development rather than exploration projects -- those that have &quot;short-term payouts,&quot; Mr. Thompson said. They will include additional wells in established fields and enhanced recovery projects in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore along the Gulf Coast.    But Phillips's strength so far this year -- as at other big oil companies -- has been gasoline refining and marketing and chemical operations, and it has been known for some time that the company was considering a major petrochemical-plant expansion.    Phillips said it will increase ethylene manufacturing capacity by 1.5 billion pounds a year at its Sweeny, Texas, complex by 1990, making Phillips one of the largest ethylene producers in the country. The plant currently produces 2.3 billion pounds a year and is going through improvements that will boost output to 2.5 billion pounds annually by mid-1989, the company said.    Ethylene is a simple petrochemical used as a building block for many plastic products, which are currently in strong demand. Prices for ethylene have more than doubled to above 30 cents a pound in just the past year.    While industry officials can vividly recall a petrochemical glut only a few years ago, Jack L. Howe, chemicals vice president, said, &quot;We see demand growing about one billion pounds a year.&quot; That's about a 3% annual increase from the current 35 billion-pound market. He said Phillips expects to secure long-term contracts for the additional capacity.    Industrywide, chemical operations of the major oil companies are booming. Just yesterday, Amoco's chemical unit said it will build a 300-person research-and-development center in Atlanta and a plant in Greenville, S.C., for a total of more than $150 million.    The plant initially will produce 1.2 million pounds a year of carbon fiber, material used by makers of aircraft, cars and sporting goods, and by other industries, Amoco said. The Greenville site is expected to be the world's largest carbon-fiber production center, the company added. </TEXT></DOC>
