Asymptoticsof the conformal block is calculated in the limit when the dimension{Delta} of the immediate operator tends to infinity. This makes it possibleto construct a recurrent relation for this function connecting the conformalblock with arbitrary {Delta} with the blocks corresponding to the dimensionsof zero vectors in degenerate representations of Virasoro algebra. Thisrelation is useful for calculating the conformal block expansion in powerof the uniformizing parameter.</TEXT></DOC>
