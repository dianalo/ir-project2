He had aged visibly in recent months, which were busy withinternational speaking trips and his work as a member of the new,competitively elected Congress.   A White House statement today hailed Sakharov as a historicfigure whose voice ``was an important dimension in the contemporarychanges under way in Soviet society.''   Human rights activist Natan Sharansky, who spent nine years inSoviet labor camps before immigrating to Israel in 1986, toldIsrael radio today that Sakharov ``had tremendous influence ...among dissidents, among free people in the Soviet Union and who byhis own personal example helped change the whole climate in theSoviet Union.''   In Strasbourg, France, the European Parliament unanimously paidtribute today to Sakharov, whose name it had given to its HumanRights Prize.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, attending a NATO summitin Brussels, Belgium, said: ``He was a tremendous force for peaceand freedom.''   The Congress formed a committee to organize Sakharov's funeral,the official Tass news agency said. It was a reflection ofSakharov's trek from his years as a lonely voice opposed to Kremlinpolicies to again becoming a honored member of society.   Born May 21, 1921, Sakharov's first became known as a greatscientist, inducted into the Academy of Sciences in 1953 at age 32,the youngest-ever member. Like his father, he became a physicist.   In 1948, he joined physicist Igor Tamm in developing thehydrogen bomb and for 20 years lived and worked in secrecy, withprivileges that included a good apartment, driver, high salary andgovernment awards. But Sakharov began to worry about the moralityof developing weapons of mass destruction.   He had his first brush with top Soviet officials in 1961, whenhe appealed to Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev to stop nuclear weaponstests. Khrushchev responded that scientists shouldn't meddle inpolitics. Two years later, the Soviet Union agreed to such limitsin a treaty with the United States.   After Sakharov formed the Human Rights Committee in 1970, hebecame better known as a dissident leader, clashing with fourKremlin leaderships over human rights, foreign policy and themorality of the nuclear weaponry he helped create.   As an emerging dissident, Sakharov appeared to be immune toofficial sanctions while other prominent dissidents were forced toemigrate or sent to labor camps. But in 1973, Sakharov was warnedby authorities that his interviews and statements were used by theforeign press for anti-Soviet slander and that he should be awareof the consequences.   Sakharov continued to speak out, and he and his wife attendedthe trials of prominent dissidents and lent their names tointernational appeals for prisoners of conscience in all countriesto be freed.   The physicist's tireless campaigns on behalf of disarmament andhuman rights won him the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, and he steadfastlyargued that without international respect for human rights therecould be no guarantee of peace.   He was stripped of his Soviet awards after he criticized the1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and then-Soviet leader LeonidBrezhnev banished him in January 1980 to Gorky, 200 miles east ofMoscow.   Sakharov was never charged with any crime or put on trial.   Reporters, foreign visitors and diplomats who knew Sakharovdescribed him as a modest man of patience and humor but determinedonce his ire was aroused.   He was released in December 1986 and recalled to Moscow byGorbachev.   He swiftly took a leading role in urging the Soviet leader tofollow through on Gorbachev's twin policies of perestroika, orrestructuring, and glasnost, or openness.   He was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies this year,completing a remarkable comeback. In June, he told the SovietCongress he had no regrets. ``I am proud of this exile in Gorkylike a medal I wear.''</TEXT></DOC>
