Mostof those crowding the street in front of BCCI's shutteredoffice here are among 40,000 Bangladeshi depositors andbusinessmen whose savings were frozen and credit lines cutoff on July 6, when the bank closed its doors. That followedthe Bank of England's unprecedented global clampdown on Bankof Credit andamp; Commerce (Holdings) S.A. to stop what regulatorsin London called widespread fraud at the Luxembourg-basedinstitution.   But the Dhaka demonstrators don't blame BCCI. Likebusinessmen and BCCI customers in many of the impoverishedcountries where the bank had offices, their loyalty remainswith the bank, and their invective is reserved for theregulators who brought it down.   &quot;This is a conspiracy against poor countries]&quot; ademonstrator screams over the din of rickshaw bells andtraffic. &quot;Lives are at stake,&quot; another hoarsely warns theleaders of the Western world, &quot;your lives.&quot; As armed riotpolice idle nearby, the hostility builds until a late-morningdownpour finally quiets emotions and disperses much of thecrowd.   To these people and to many elsewhere in the developingworld, the collapse of BCCI meant more than the loss of lifesavings or easy credit; it also shattered dreams ofself-reliance and opened a new rift with the industrializedWest.   BCCI had become a touchstone of the developing world'saspirations to growth and international acceptance. BCCIappeared to be a visionary bank: the first, and often theonly, global commercial bank overtly committed to financingtrade and offering small-business loans and financialservices in the most backward regions. The bank's south Asianfounders and Middle Eastern owners carefully fostered thatimage through charitable foundations, close ties tosympathetic world leaders, including former President JimmyCarter, and even the establishment of an internationalmagazine, South, devoted to the Third World. (The magazinecompany had since been sold.)   But in countries such as Bangladesh, the bank wassometimes as much a conduit for the developing world'scorruption as it was a beacon of hope. In 15 years of doingbusiness here in Dhaka, the bank allowed influentialbusinessmen to default on major loans, hired close relativesof people in power and even helped transfer large sums ofmoney out of the country.   &quot;It had all the characteristics of the Third World,including the bad side,&quot; says M. Shahidul Islam, a critic offormer Bangladesh strongman Lt. Gen. Hussain Mohammed Ershad.Mr. Islam accuses BCCI of having helped the now-imprisonedpresident export hard currency desperately needed here.&quot;People sometimes overlooked that,&quot; says Mr. Islam, a formeraide to Gen. Ershad. &quot;They just loved the idea of a ThirdWorld bank.&quot;   In the 70 countries where the bank did business,especially in the poorest reaches of Asia, Africa and LatinAmerica, BCCI was willing to take on risks and do businessthat other international banks -- often American or British-- shied away from.   &quot;No other banks knew the regions where I do business sowell,&quot; says J. Panjabi, a 41-year-old Indian-born businessmanin Hong Kong who sells about $4 million a year in electronicgoods, toys and consumer products made in China to buyers inthe Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. &quot;BCCI had thenetwork.&quot;   Now thousands of small traders like Mr. Panjabi arevirtually out of business. He kept all his company's accounts-- nearly half a million dollars -- along with $7,700 infamily savings at BCCI in Hong Kong. &quot;That was it,&quot; he moans.&quot;And this,&quot; he says, gesturing at a cramped, windowlessoffice cluttered with bright-plastic toys&quot; -- is all I haveleft.&quot;   Although the British colony's government has promiseddepositors that they will get at least 25% of their moneyback soon, a government plan to liquidate the bank if itcan't be sold means businessmen like Mr. Panjabi will lose amajor source of financing. One likely result: shrinkingcommerce with the Third World. By one BCCI official'sestimate, the bank bankrolled up to 4% of all trade in HongKong. Much of it was trade with developing nations.   In Dhaka, when the central Bangladesh Bank reluctantlyclosed BCCI's four domestic branches, at the request ofBCCI's owners in Abu Dhabi, it wrecked what one Bangladeshidiplomat called, &quot;the cornerstone bank of the rising middleclass.&quot;   In a country of 113 million people, where three-quartersof the population lives in dire poverty and two-thirds hasnever used a bank, any financial institution is almostinevitably a tool of the middle class. But a gradual easingof banking regulations in the 1980s allowed private banks toflourish and gave a lift to new businesses that previouslyfound it difficult if not impossible to wangle a loan frombureaucratic state-owned banks.   More than any of its six foreign or 18 local rivals, BCCIexploited the possibilities, lending to small businessmen,handling foreign-exchange business, advertising heavily fornew business and soliciting foreign-currency deposits fromairlines and embassies. That approach built tremendousloyalty.   &quot;At other banks, you had to know someone to get somethingdone, but not at BCCI,&quot; says Ghulam Mohiuddin, a 35-year-oldMassachusetts Institute of Technology graduate who importsApple computers and kept a business account at the bank.&quot;BCCI was a Third World dream, and a lot of people hadsentimental feelings for the bank.&quot;   Mohammed Saiful Islam was one of those people. The46-year-old managing director of a shipping company, hemanaged to get $750,000 in loans from BCCI to finance thepurchase of three vessels. Other banks wouldn't commit themoney: &quot;Maybe, maybe not,&quot; is how he describes theirattitude.   &quot;But BCCI was a Third World bank that was coming up,taking leadership, giving service,&quot; says Mr. Islam, who hashad deposits in Dhaka and Hong Kong frozen. &quot;If it reopenedtomorrow, I would not withdraw my money.&quot;   Such customer loyalty was especially deep in Bangladeshbecause to many Bangladeshi businessmen, BCCI was aBangladeshi bank. Its founder and former chairman, Agha HasanAbedi, spent more than four decades working in local banksboth during and since the time Bangladesh was part ofPakistan. To many older businessmen, BCCI was simply anextension of banking institutions Mr. Abedi had foundedearlier in his career.   &quot;His concept was always unique,&quot; says Mahbubur Rahman,president of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry and acustomer, nearly three decades ago, of Mr. Abedi's firstbank, United Bank Ltd., founded in 1958. &quot;For smallshopkeepers or traders, his people just wandered in, askedyou how much you needed and supplied it,&quot; Mr. Rahman says.&quot;They had calculated that even if 10% turned out to be baddebts, they could sustain it. And it turned out verysuccessfully.&quot;   After the 1971 civil war, Mr. Abedi retreated from whathad been East Pakistan -- now Bangladesh -- and returned toPakistan. His banking empire there was nationalized two yearslater. But by then he had collected $10 million andestablished BCCI in Luxembourg, beyond the reach of mostregulators. In 1976, BCCI opened its doors in Dhaka.   Almost immediately, the bank attracted attention toitself. Jealous rivals noticed the expensive new Japanesecars senior managers of BCCI drove. Mr. Abedi revivedtechniques that had worked for him before: sending hisbankers door-to-door to solicit business, taking risks onupstart firms, doing in five minutes a foreign-exchangetransaction that would take other banks a half-hour.   &quot;You would start off banking with five different banks,&quot;says Zahed Chowdhury, finance director of CITech Co., theApple computer distributor in Dhaka. &quot;But within a year, youwould only want to bank with BCCI.&quot;   Government officials, too, were pleased with its success.&quot;It provided some examples to other banks,&quot; says a financeministry official responsible for the banking industry.BCCI's roster of clients -- all of whose deposits now arefrozen -- soon included the central bank, many of thethousands of skilled Bangladeshi workers who earnforeign-exchange overseas, even many disaster-relief accountsset up to help victims of the cyclone that killed as many as140,000 earlier this year.   The central Bangladesh Bank sets the range of interestrates that a bank can pay on deposits and charge on loans.BCCI, its customers and other bankers agree, always chargedat the high end of the range for loans -- and paid on thehigh end for deposits. The result, rival bankers say, was asteady flow of deposits into BCCI and out of other banks. Inthe past five years, BCCI's total deposits in Bangladeshsoared, to $211 million from $162 million, according to theestimates of other bankers.   The bank's aggressiveness also led to an unusually highlevel of defaults by customers. A study published byBangladesh Bank in May suggested that nearly one-fifth ofBCCI's assets were in default. &quot;I don't see how a bank canmake money on that basis,&quot; an official of a rival foreignbank says.   But it can make important connections. Many of the loansof more than $670,000 on a list of defaulters published byBangladesh Bank to embarrass &quot;crony capitalists&quot; were made tobusinessmen with close ties to the former government of Gen.Ershad, who fell from power last December after nearly adecade of dictatorship. When the list was printed, the bankissued a preachy statement that bad loans benefit onlydefaulters and add &quot;to the sufferings of the people.&quot;   One of the biggest defaulters was a company controlled bythe family of Salman F. Rahman, a silver-haired 40-year-oldbusinessman. His trading and industrial conglomerate,Beximco, flourished during the Ershad years. The company isin arrears on a $4.2 million BCCI loan that it still vows torepay. Mr. Rahman says he did business with BCCI not becauseof connections but because of service. &quot;We could phone up andask for a loan, and they would say `OK,'&quot; Mr. Rahman says.   Even if the bank hadn't been currying favor with the loansit made, it ingratiated itself in its hiring. At least adozen relatives of former Bangladeshi officials got jobs atBCCI offices here and abroad. Among them: Gen. Ershad'sbrother-in-law, Golam Morshed, who worked in BCCI's Londonoffice, and Mahbub Rahman, a brother of the late presidentZiaur Rahman. President Rahman was the husband of thecountry's current prime minister, Khaleda Zia. Otheremployees are related to past and present foreign ministers,finance ministers and central bank officials.   BCCI officials say that such employees &quot;worked in the banklike anybody else.&quot; But people familiar with the bank'sactivities say the connections helped it transact anotherkind of business as well. Mr. Islam, the critic of Gen.Ershad and a former aide, in 1988 published an expose of theformer president alleging corruption on his part. Mr. Islampublished copies of BCCI telexes detailing weeklycash-in-a-suitcase transfers of $150,000 to a BCCI account inLondon. Mr. Islam believes it to have been Gen. Ershad'smoney. The bank doesn't dispute the authenticity of thetelexes, but it threatened to sue Mr. Islam for allegationsthat the money was transferred illegally.   Some BCCI officials don't deny that the bank may have beenused for capital flight. But they insist that they neverviolated laws. Cash transfers were authorized by BangladeshBank, they say, which by law had to approve major currencytransfers. If Gen. Ershad was able to get the central bank tosign off on currency transfers, or so the argument goes, BCCIcan't be held responsible for transferring his money.   While the closing of BCCI will bring such activities onits part to an end, many in Bangladesh wonder whether thepositive side of BCCI's business -- quick decisions, goodservice, an aggressive willingness to lend -- isn't worthpreserving in an economically troubled country.   One of the country's most promising industries, garmentmaking, has been hardest hit by the shuttering of BCCI. Lastyear, according to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers andExporters Association, the bank financed nearly 10% ofBangladesh's garment exports -- at $778 million the country'sbiggest export in the 12 months that ended June 30. MohammadMosharraf Hossain, the association's president, says someproducers may go out of business because of the BCCI mess.   &quot;If you can't get financing for materials, you'll miss theautumn season,&quot; he warns. He says the industry believes theBank of England acted imperiously and rashly in closing BCCI.   &quot;If money laundering or fraud has taken place, it neitherstarted 19 years ago nor ended July 6,&quot; he says.   Not everyone in Dhaka remains enamored of BCCI. Oneprofessed friend of the developing world, Enayetullah Khan, aformer ambassador to China and Burma and editor in chief ofHoliday, a national weekly, accuses BCCI of &quot;using a ThirdWorld image to cover up a first-world crime.&quot; But even hequestions the West's motives in closing the bank.   A senior government official echoes the prevalentsentiment in Dhaka. &quot;I'm not saying if they were doingsomething irregular that it should be condoned,&quot; thebureaucrat says. &quot;But if they were, couldn't the guiltypeople have been put in jail? This certainly gives rise to akind of suspicion on the part of many people in the ThirdWorld that the West is against us.&quot;   Mr. Rahman of the Dhaka chamber of commerce personalizesit: &quot;They spoke our language. They were our brothers, ourcousins, our friends. And now they are no more.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
