VIEW TO RETURN $173,000 IN DISPUTE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The lawsuit centers on a building permit issued by Mountain View in 1986for Eagle Square Partners to build a mixed-use development on Castro Street,which was the target of a large city redevelopment program. The permit calledon the developers to pay for light fixtures, tree grates and other specialitems for the sidewalk in front of the property.;    No price for theimprovements was listed on the permit, and when the city sent a $402,759 billin February 1990, Eagle Square Partners immediately protested.;    Thedevelopers claimed that the city charged for extra improvements not listed onthe permit that totaled $241,400.;    They also accused the Mountain Viewofficials of &quot;deciding to shift as much of the cost (of Castro Streetredevelopment) as possible to private developers . . . regardless of the exactwording of their development approvals,&quot; the lawsuit stated.;    In courtrecords, the city denied this, saying all the charges were fair and thatMountain View officials told the developers before issuing the permit that thesidewalk repairs could total $500,000.;    In May 1990, the developers paidthe full bill &quot;under protest,&quot; and soon after filed the lawsuit asking thecity to return $241,400 plus 8 percent interest, as well as declare that thebill amounted to a &quot;special tax imposed illegally.&quot;;    Attorneys said the$173,000 refund was the best way of avoiding a costly trial.;    &quot;This was acompromise,&quot; said Andrew L. Faber, the developers' attorney. &quot;Clearly, bothsides agreed that there was some ambiguity in the language&quot; of the permit.;   Faber and Mountain View's attorney E. Luis Saenz agreed that the settlementdoes not mean other building permits should now be questioned, because eachpermit is written individually and Eagle Square's was fairly unique.;    &quot;Thecity of Mountain View did not intentionally overcharge anyone,&quot; Saenz said.But he added that the lawsuit does hold a lesson in how building permitsshould be written. &quot;The more careful and clear they are . . . the less likelythere is to be a dispute.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SHELBY GRAD, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910613  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  412  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday June 13, 199100165008,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
