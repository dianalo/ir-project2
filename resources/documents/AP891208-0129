At a rally of more than 100,000 people, Corazon Aquino waggedher finger and said of Vice President Salvador Laurel, who hasbecome her political rival: ``He's just too much. He keeps onsaying, `Cory resign, Cory resign.' What does he think I am,stupid? That I would resign just like that so he can be president?''   The crowd chanted:``Cory! Cory! Cory!''   It was much like February 1986, when Mrs. Aquino, thepresidential candidate who described herself as ``just ahousewife,'' was swept into office by an outpouring of ``peoplepower.''   Mrs. Aquino appears to have emerged from the ruins of aweek-long coup attempt with a new boldness, determined to confronther foes and circumvent the advisers who have shielded her from thepeople.   She lambasted Laurel and Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, whom she firedas defense minister in November 1986 after his followers attempteda coup. She spoke extemporaneously in the accent and Tagaloglanguage of uneducated Filipinos, not the polished English of mostpublic addresses.   When she told Senate President Jovito Salonga she wanted Enrileinvestigated by the Senate committee examining the latest coup,Mrs. Aquino told the crowd, Salonga replied that he had put Enrileon the committee.   That, she declared, caused her to pound her fist on the tableand say: ``Are we fooling each other or what? He should be the oneinvestigated and not the investigator!''   Enrile agreed to remove himself from the committee, she said. Tohowls of approval, she added the postscript: ``It's good that hestill has a little shame left.''   In praising loyal military officers, she mentioned Brig. Gen.Arturo Enrile, who negotiated the surrender of rebels Thursday inManila, and observed, ``Thank God he is not related to Sen.Enrile.''   Of Laurel she said, using his nickname: ``Before coming here, Isaid to myself, `Should I even bother to mention that Doy Laurel orshould I just flick him away like a fly?'''   After the remarks about his desire to replace her, Mrs. Aquinosaid Laurel receives 24 million pesos ($1.1 million) in officeallowances as vice president.   ``I've been thinking, if Doy Laurel really loves our country ashe says he does, maybe it's about time he resigned so we can usethat 24 million pesos,'' she told the crowd. ``Since we know thathe cannot wait to be president, I will never give up this positionto him.''   Mrs. Aquino's style was the same one she used in 1986 to defeatFerdinand E. Marcos, who had ruled the archipelago for 20 years.The crowd approved.   ``Her remarks may be unpresidential, but the fight has reallybecome personal,'' said a businessman, who asked that his name notbe used.   Celia Yutuc, an optometrist, said: ``That's what we wanted tohear. We're happy.''</TEXT></DOC>
