Its purpose is to read cross section data from a WIMS-E interface,a two dimensional cluster geometry from user input, and to calculatethe associated region to region first flight neutron collision probabilities.These it writes back to the interface as data for a solution module whichcan calculate fluxes. Recent modifications to the code have providedbetter data checking facilities including a lineprinter geometry plottingoption, and the option of an explicit square outer boundary. This reportbriefly describes the modifications that have been made to the code andincludes a complete user guide to all options, old and new.</TEXT></DOC>
