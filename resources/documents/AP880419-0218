(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A pre-dawn tornado exploded through thisrural North Florida community Tuesday, killing four people,destroying homes, throwing people from their beds and leaving muchof a college campus in ruins.   Only rubble was left in some neighborhoods after the tornado cuta swath 12 miles long and at least a half-mile wide about 4:30 a.m.Eighteen people suffered injuries requiring hospital treatment. Themobile home of two of those who were killed vanished from its lot,leaving only foundation blocks.   Families were thrown out of bed while windows exploded and theirhomes collapsed on top of them.   ``I woke up with a roaring sound and as soon as I woke up, thewindows blew out on both sides of my bed, and the roof came down ontop of me,'' said Mitchell May, who was pinned in the debris forthree hours.   His neighbor, Diane Dempsey, said she and her husband, Pat, hadonly moments to rush their three children, ages 4 to 11, into thebathroom before the tornado hit.   ``They were screaming `are we dying, are we dying?''' she said.``Then it was over as soon as it started.''   It was Florida's worst tornado since 1966 when a twister crossedthe state from Clearwater to Cape Kennedy, killing 11 and injuring400 people. In 1962 a tornado on the Florida Panhandle killed 17people and injured 100.   Gov. Bob Martinez flew to inspect the scene and said he intendedto sign an emergency order allowing state and federal aid.   ``It's been tragic,'' said Martinez.   Lawmen from the state and surrounding counties were already onhand, and state prisoners were expected soon to help with thecleanup, said Sheriff Joe Peavy.   The twister's destructive path started in front of a shoppingcenter and headed straight into North Florida Community College,where it ``totaled the new library and took the roof off theauditorium,'' Peavy said.   College President William H. McCoy estimated damage at between$20 million and $25 million. Three of the campus' 14 buildings weredestroyed and nine heavily damaged, he said.   It also demolished numerous homes, blew the roof off a nearbychurch, overturned cars and knocked down trees, Peavy said.   It ripped apart the only obstetrical clinic serving afour-county area around Madison, leaving 350 to 400 mothers a yearwithout a place to have their babies, said Betsy Stone, executivedirector of the Tri-County Community Medical Center. No one wasinjured there, however.   The worst damage was in the vicinity of Pinetta, a cross-roadsneighborhood near Madison.   ``I almost fell to my knees it was so strong,'' said OtisWilliams, 69. His son's home across the street was destroyed.   Also in Pinetta, the bodies of Robert and Lavelle McCulloughwere thrown 100 yards and their mobile home disappeared, leavingbehind only a dozen cinder blocks on a bare patch of ground.   Mrs. McCullough's sister, Dorothy Butler of nearby Jennings,surveyed the damage a few hours after learning her sister had died.   ``It didn't leave any of it. Not even a dish,'' she saiddisbelievingly. ``You'd never know there was a trailer here.''   Sheriff's spokesman Juan Botino identified the two other victimsas Walter Oliver Jr. and Dearmiste Pinesett. Of the 18 injuries,two of the more seriously hurt were flown 50 miles to TallahasseeMemorial Regional Medical Center. Brad Williams, 14, was in seriouscondition Tuesday after surgery for a punctured kidney, and MaryKay Smith was in fair condition with a chest injury, a spokesmansaid. Ms. Smith's age was unavailable.   Two others remained in good condition in Madison County MemorialHospital, administrator Jeannie Baker said.   About 100 miles to the west, two tornadoes touched down inJackson County, causing two minor injuries and destroying threehouses and a mobile home, as well as heavily damaging five otherhomes, said John Mader, the county emergency management director.   The same storm that spawned the tornadoes swept through southGeorgia late Monday and early Tuesday, ripping off roofs, tearingdown trees and injuring at least four people in mobile homes thatwere tossed about by strong winds.  </TEXT></DOC>
