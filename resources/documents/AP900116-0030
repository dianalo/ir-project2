Despite the lack of automobile in the ad, many recognize thespot as a commercial for Infiniti, the Japanese luxury car. But tosome New England viewers, not all is as it appears.   A series of advertisements parodying the Infiniti approach hashad New England talking, laughing and watching.   ``Questions. What are we for? Why am I here?'' asks a voicenarrating one of the parodic spots, as the camera shows a forestscene. The voice continues: ``especially when Oldsmobile is havinga great sale right now.''   The camera cuts to a plug from an Oldsmobile spokesman, a fewshots of cars, and a running track of the theme song ``This is notyour father's Oldsmobile.''   When the scene returns to the forest, the voice asks: ``What isa factory-to-dealer incentive anyway?'' It trails off, wondering:``How much wood could a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck couldchuck...''   To the makers of the Infiniti ad, imitation is the best form offlattery.   ``I think it's a terrific parody. They did a terrific job ofplaying around with our ad,'' said Chuck Kushell, executive vicepresident, general manager at Hill, Holliday, Connors, CosmopulosInc. Advertising of Los Angeles, where the Infiniti ads were made.   In a November Gallup poll for Advertising Age magazine, theInfiniti series had the best recall of all of the ads that monthamong 1,000 viewers surveyed, ``over Coke, over McDonalds,''Kushell said.   Sidney Zussman, president of The New England Oldsmobile Dealersand the owner of West Street Motors in Methuen, said his grouploved the ads _ and that sales at Oldsmobile went up 25 percentduring the holiday markdowns that were publicized by the ads.</TEXT><HEAD>Laserphoto HL1 of Jan. 15</HEAD><DATELINE>HELENA, Mont.
