Computer makers who are chasing the elusive home marketsay IBM's attempt to make the machines easy to use, even fornovices, makes some sense. Dealers and consultants add thatIBM's prices are reasonably aggressive and that it seems tohave thought through many of the delicate marketing issues.As a result, it appears that IBM has at least a limitedsuccess on its hands.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, as IBM provided details of the newmachines' &quot;specs&quot; to reporters in interviews yesterday, somecompetitors and consultants disparaged the new computers'capabilities and raised the specter of the PCjr, IBM'smuch-ridiculed and unsuccessful attempt to crack the homemarket in the mid-1980s. The competitors and consultantsespecially argued that it is too awkward to add circuitboards to the new machines to expand their computing power.   &quot;These machines are all marketing and no technology,&quot; saysFred Davis, director of the testing laboratory at PCMagazine, one of the trade publications whose reviewsinfluence the sales of personal-computer products.   As widely expected, the announcement says the machines usethe moderately powerful Intel Corp. 80286 processor. Listprices for the line will run from $1,000 to $2,000 and thesystems will range from a computer with a black-and-whitemonitor and no hard disk drive to a computer with a colormonitor and a 30-megabyte hard disk. Actual selling priceswill be somewhat lower than list prices, but discounts may beonly half the size of the 25% discounts that are common onmost personal computers.   All the systems will have a fairly fast modem for talkingwith other computers across phone lines. In addition, IBM isincluding the software for the Prodigy videotext service thatit and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. have set up for users to shop bycomputer and to gather information electronically.   The new IBM computers also include a &quot;mouse&quot; pointingdevice, for moving the cursor around the screen, andMicrosoft Works, a software package that lets users do alittle bit of everything from word processing to spreadsheetsand data bases. Some of the basic software is loaded inchips, so the system actually presents the user with ameaningful screen as soon as it is turned on instead of juststaring back blankly.   IBM will sell the machines through many of its currentdealers. But it also is taking a bold gamble and will attemptto sell the complex machines through department stores. Thecompany says computers should become as ubiquitous asmicrowave ovens and video cassette records and thus will needto be distributed the same way as appliances. It adds thatmost of its regular dealers aren't open when people arebuying home computers -- Thursday and Friday nights and onweekends.   IBM says it will sell through nearly 1,000 Sears,Dayton-Hudson and Dillard stores nationwide when the newmachines become widely available in September. This summer,as a sort of shakedown cruise, IBM will sell limitedquantities through those department stores and dealers inChicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Dallas-Fort Worth.   IBM will toss in more service than is generally availablefor home computers. It will promise to replace faultyhardware within 48 hours, for instance. The company also willoffer extensive facilities for people to dial into theProdigy service to get answers to questions such as how touse the software that comes with the system.   IBM also promises not to point any fingers at thedevelopers of the software, either; one of the biggestheadaches in getting service these days seems to be thatevery company a user calls blames a problem on someone elsewho made some of the system's hardware or software.   &quot;It's the wrong approach to expect people to becomecomputer-literate,&quot; says Alan Hald, chairman of MicroAgeInc., a big computer chain. &quot;It makes much more sense to makecomputers human-literate, and IBM seems to be taking somesteps in that direction.&quot;   There are also some consumer trends that seem to beworking in IBM's favor. Link Resources Corp., amarket-research firm, says the number of U.S. households witha personal computer is growing 10% a year. Only about 40% ofthat market currently is taken by IBM-compatible machines butthat percentage is expected to grow considerably, as peopletake more work home from the IBM-compatible machines they useat the office.   Jim Cannavino, the general manager of IBM'spersonal-computer and workstation group, is even moreoptimistic than Link. He says that 20 million U.S. householdsnow have PCs and that the number could double within fiveyears.   &quot;The home market is too big to ignore,&quot; he says.   Still, IBM may face a withering series of comparisons bycompetitors on price and performance. IBM-compatible &quot;clones&quot;that are somewhat more powerful than the new machinescurrently are available for at least $400 less than IBM'smost powerful system. In addition, these clones includeso-called expansion slots for additional circuit boards thatcan, for example, let the computer also function as afacsimile machine. IBM's new systems, called the PS/1 line,have most of the features that normally require a slotalready built in, but anyone wanting to go beyond thesefeatures must buy a $169 piece of hardware that includesthree open slots.   &quot;You have to give people a way to expand,&quot; complains TimBajarin, a consultant at Creative Strategies ResearchInternational. &quot;The PC magazines are going to have a fieldday with this.&quot;   IBM also could run into some snags with its customerservice. While extensive, the service requires that people becomfortable dialing into an electronic system that mightconfound a novice computer user.   There are potential problems with IBM's existing dealers,too. Matt Fitzsimmons, owner of a ComputerLand store in WhitePlains, N.Y., says he likes the new system but adds that&quot;dealers' greatest fear is that someone will come in and makeyou explain how this differs from everything else in IBM'sproduct line -- and then go off and buy the machine at alower price from one of the mass merchandisers.&quot;   Even if the PS/1 becomes a rip-roaring success,consultants say competitors such as Tandy Corp. should dowell, too. &quot;I think IBM will generate a lot of interest atthe low end,&quot; says Bobby Orbach, who recently founded acomputer and software marketing consulting firm. &quot;Not onlywill IBM sell a lot of boxes, but other companies will, too.&quot;   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, IBMrose 37.5 cents to $116.625.</TEXT></DOC>
