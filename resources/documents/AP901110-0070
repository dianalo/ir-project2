The report by Tim McNally, attorney general for the Orange FreeState province, and police Lt. Gen. Alwyn Conradie was completed inNovember 1989 but not released until Saturday.   A similiar inquiry into the unsolved killings of more than 60opposition activists has also been conducted. That report isexpected to be released shortly, but there has been no indicationof its findings.   Anti-apartheid groups have long accused security forces ofkilling opposition figures and are expected to protest thecommittee's findings.   There was no immediate comment from police, who have previouslydenied the existence of death squads. They have claimed anycampaign against anti-apartheid figures was carried out byindividuals acting on their own.   Saturday's report involved charges by a former policeman ondeath row and his former superior. They claimed they killed morethan 10 people during the 1980s, including Durban anti-apartheidlawyer Griffiths Mxenge in 1981.   The report said the allegations by Almond Nofomela and formerpolice Capt. Dirk Coetzee were untrue and information from both menwas unreliable.   A departmental inquiry into alleged misconduct by Coetzee hadrecommended his dismissal from the force because he was a risk toits security, the report said. But because he was a diabetic,Coetzee was permitted to retire at a reduced salary on medicalgrounds.   Coetzee, who is white, fled the country last year and claimed tohave joined the African National Congress, the largest blackopposition group.   Nofomela first made the accusations Oct. 19, 1989, the daybefore he was scheduled to be executed for a killing with noapparent political overtones.   He named Coetzee and another former policeman as having carriedout killings with him.   Nofomela later pleaded guilty to the stabbing death of Mxenge.He remains in jail. The other man, David Tshikalanga, has fled thecountry and also claimed to have taken part in killings authorizedby superiors.   The report said Nofomela's account of Mxenge's killing wasinconsistent with other testimony in the case, making hisstatements unreliable.   But there was no explanation for why the government chargedNofomela with Mxenge's killing and accepted his guilty plea.   Earlier Saturday, two youths were killed and 18 people injuredin a black township where residents protesting an electricitycutoff clashed with police.   In the Atteridgeville township outside Pretoria, violence brokeout as residents tried to restore electrical power to their homes.   Authorities cut the power last week because residents havestopped paying bills to protest living conditions and localofficials, who township residents consider collaborators with thewhite-led government.   Two youths, ages 11 and 18, died of shotgun wounds and 17protesters were treated for birdshot wounds, Maj. Ray Harrald said.He said it was unclear if the deaths and injuries were because ofthe police action.   One policeman was hit by a rock and received stitches, Harraldsaid.   Nelson Mandela, deputy ANC president, said Saturday that ANCPresident Oliver Tambo has recovered well from a stroke and wouldreturn to South Africa next month after 30 years in exile.   Tambo, who has been out of the country since 1960, is expectednext month to attend an ANC conference, the group's first in SouthAfrica in three decades.   Attempts to reach Tambo for comment in London were unsuccessful.</TEXT></DOC>
