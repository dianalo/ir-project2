RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today struck down a newfederal law that outlaws burning the American flag. ``Punishingdesecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes thisemblem so revered,'' the court said.   In other rulings, the court gave police broad new authority tostop and question someone on the basis of an anonymous tip, andruled that the federal government may order state National Guardtroops to participate in peacetime training abroad without agovernor's consent.   The court's 5-4 decision in the flag case indicated thedivisiveness of the emotional issue. The ruling is certain to touchoff a political battle in Congress to pass a constitutionalamendment protecting the flag from desecration.   In a split identical to a ruling last year on the flag-burningissue, the justices said the Flag Protection Act of 1989 violatesfreedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment to theConstitution. Writing for the majority, Justice William J. Brennancalled it a ``bedrock'' constitutional guarantee.   President Bush said he would intensify his efforts to winapproval of a constitutional amendment banning flag-burning. ``Someof us said ahead of time that the legislative approach would not beupheld. Apparently, the court decided that,'' he said.   Speaking to reporters after a Rose Garden ceremony honoringdrug-free schools, Bush said that he would ``continue to press forwhat I strongly believe is in the public interest.''   Congressional leaders had said if the law were declared invalidthey would move quickly for votes in the House and Senate on aconstitutional amendment to protect Old Glory from burning ordesecration.   That move is expected to inject the issue into this fall'scongressional and state legislative campaigns.   A constitutional amendment would require approval by two-thirdsof the members of the House and Senate and then ratification by 38state legislatures. The First Amendment never has been altered in199 years.   ``We are aware that desecration of the flag is deeply offensiveto many,'' Brennan wrote.   But, quoting from the court's earlier ruling, he said, ``Ifthere is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it isthat the government may not prohibit the expression of an ideasimply because society finds the idea itself offensive ordisagreeable.''   Brennan noted that the government has said there is a nationalconsensus in favor of banning flag burning. ``Even assuming such aconsensus exists, any suggestion that the government's interest insuppressing speech becomes more weighty as popular opposition tothat speech grows is foreign to the First Amendment,'' he said.   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, said thegovernment has a legitimate interest in banning flag burning.   ``The flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty, equalityand tolerance _ ideas that Americans have passionately defended anddebated throughout our history,'' he said. ``The flag embodies thespirit of our national commitment to those ideals.''   In the 1989 case, the court struck down a Texas law banning flagburning. It was that year-old opinion that prompted Congress toapprove the federal law declared unconstitutional today.   Supporters of the federal legislation said it is different fromthe Texas law because the federal act does not single out flagburning as a means of expression.   The federal law forbids defiling or destruction of the flag forany purpose _ except to destroy a soiled or worn flag.   David Cole, an attorney with the Center for ConstitutionalRights and co-counsel for defendants in the case, said, ``We areoverjoyed. The court has essentially said that the First Amendmentmeans what it says. And that is that the government cannotincarcerate its citizens for engaging in political expression thatthe government doesn't like.   The Bush administration, with some reluctance, joined indefending the federal law.   President Bush and leading Republicans said they would prefer aconstitutional amendment to ban flag burning, and Bush allowed thelegislation to become law without his signature.   ``I remain convinced ... that a constitutional amendment is theonly way to ensure that our flag is protected from desecration,''Bush said then.   In the 6-3 police ruling, the justices said anonymous tips canjustify stopping and questioning someone if the information is insome way corroborated before such action is taken.   In the National Guard case that revived a controversy from the1988 presidential campaign, the justices unanimously upheld a 1986federal law challenged by Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota.   The law was challenged previously by Gov. Michael Dukakis ofMassachusetts, the defeated 1988 Democratic presidential candidatewho opposed sending National Guard troops to train in CentralAmerica.   In other action today, the court:   _ Refused to let a private Jewish group display a menorah in apublic park near the Burlington, Vt., City Hall.   The justices, without comment, let stand a rulilng that barredcity officials last December from granting permission for themenorah's display.   _ Agreed to hear a Bush administration appeal aimed at headingoff all lawsuits against government employees accused of causingpersonal injury.   The court said it will consider killing a Texas family's medicalmalpractice suit against an Army doctor.   _ Agreed to review a dispute over the power of federalprosecutors to force distributors of adult books and films to turnover such material and business records to the government.   The court said it will review a ruling that a New York Citycompany must turn over business records _ but not193 videotapes _to a prosecutor in Virginia.   The prime sponsors of the flag-burning law were Democrats, wholearned a bitter lesson from the 1988 presidential campaign inwhich Bush exploited patriotic values in defeating Gov. MichaelDukakis of Massachusetts.   The law made it a crime punishable by up to a year in prison foranyone who burns, mutilates, defaces, tramples the flag or``maintains (it) on the floor or ground.''   The latter phrase was prompted by a controversial Chicago artexhibit last year in which viewers were invited to stand on anAmerican flag and write comments about the display in a ledger.   Today's cases reached the court after federal judges in theDistrict of Columbia and Seattle said the federal law violatesFirst Amendment rights. The law was challenged by demonstrators whoburned American flags in the two cities.   Brennan read for six minutes from his opinion in the hushed andcrowded courtroom.   Brennan was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.Blackmun, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.   Stevens was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, ByronR. White and Sandra Day O'Connor.   The cases are U.S. vs. Eichman, 89-1433, and U.S. vs. Haggerty,89-1434.</TEXT></DOC>
