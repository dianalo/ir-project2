Circuit Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg apparently was questionedabout Meese's role in formulating Justice Department policy on thebreakup of American Telephone andamp; Telgraph Co. stock at a time whenthe attorney general owned telephone stock.   Ginsburg, who headed the antitrust division in 1985 and 1986,presumably was asked about his knowledge of meetings Meese had withexecutives of four of the seven regional telephone companies formedby the 1984 breakup of ATandamp;T.   Meese meetings with executives of the so-called Baby Bellcompanies when he and his wife owned 91 shares of Baby Bell stockis being investigated by independent counsel James C. McKay forpossible conflict-of-interest violations.   As of April 1, McKay said there was insufficient evidence tobring criminal charges against the attorney general in connectionwith the Baby Bell stock or other matters still under investigation.   But the investigation is expected to continue until month's end,when McKay is prepared to issue a report if he does not bringcharges.   At the time of their meetings with Meese, officials of the BabyBells were seeking a modification of the 1984 decree that wouldallow them to manufacture telephone equipment and offerlong-distance and computer services.   In an about-face last year, the Justice Department urged U.S.District Judge Harold Greene to allow the Baby Bells to expandtheir operations to include equipment manufacturing, long-distanceand computer services.   The Meeses sold their shares in the Baby Bell stock for $14,000last summer.   Greene denied most of the request by the government and the BabyBells, except that he allowed the regional companies to performsome types of information services.   Before joining the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here in late1986, Ginsburg had been assistant attorney general in charge of theantitrust division, Previously, he had been the No. 2 official inthe division.   There was no immediate comment from the judge's chambers aboutGinsburg's testimony.   Last year, he was nominated to a vacancy on the Supreme Courtbut withdrew his name from consideration following reports that hehad once used marijuana and allegations of possibleconflict-of-interest arising from his ownership of stock in acompany that is one of the largest operators of cable televisionsystems.   A preliminary inquiry conducted by the Justice Departmentexamined 16 instances in which Ginsburg dealt with cable industryissues while holding the stock, but determined that either hisparticipation or chance of gain was too minimal to violateconflict-of-interest laws.</TEXT></DOC>
