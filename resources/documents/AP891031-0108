Monday night's melee marked the toughest official treatment ofan unsanctioned gathering in the Soviet capital in more than 1{years. It followed a candlelight vigil outside KGB headquarters tocommemorate Stalin's victims.   A splinter group of about 500 people chanting slogans againstthe Soviet secret police set off for Pushkin Square, where humanrights demonstrations often take place.   They were attacked by police, and scores of protesters wereknocked to the ground, beaten and dragged into waiting police buses.   ``It was an unsanctioned demonstration and police had to breakit up,'' said Gen. Georgy V. Postoyuk, chief of Moscow's PublicOrder Department. ``They used force, as there was no other way tomake the people stop rioting.''   He said in an interview that 69 protesters were detained. Onewas given a 15-day jail sentence Tuesday by an administrativejudge, while others got seven- or five-day terms or fines, Postoyuksaid.   Witnesses said police attacked without warning and thedemonstrators had been peaceful.   The Tass news agency said the protesters were ``trying to createas much disruption as possible, to display anti-Soviet posters andshout anti-Soviet slogans.''   Many were members of the Democratic Union, a group founded tochallenge the political monopoly of the Communist Party and createa Western-style parliamentary democracy in the Soviet Union.   About 1,000 people converged on KGB headquarters on DzerzhinskySquare after dusk to mark the unofficial ``Day of the PoliticalPrisoner'' and mourn the millions wrongly imprisoned or killedunder dictator Josef Stalin.   Two rows of people holding candles lined up on three sides ofthe building, home of the infamous Lubyanka prison where, underStalin, political prisoners were executed with a shot to the backof the head.   The hour-long peaceful vigil was organized by the MemorialSociety, which seeks to commemorate those who suffered unjustlyunder Stalin, and the Democratic Union.   At the end of the vigil, the splinter group of mostly young menmarched toward Pushkin Square.   Chanting, ``Shame on the KGB!'' and ``The KGB is the enemy ofthe people!'' the group was confronted without warning by riotpolice two blocks from Pushkin Square as they passed out leafletsto homebound commuters.   The white-helmeted police, armed with long black rubbertruncheons, formed a line, then waded into the protesters, clubbingat least four of their leaders to the ground, then dragging theminto nearby buses for detention.   The demonstrators retreated, then formed again and headed toGorky Street, which leads to Pushkin Square. Riot police and otheruniformed officers sealed off the square and split the protestersinto two groups.   On Gorky Street, riot police again charged the demonstrators,taking about six into custody. As the protesters were dragged tothe buses, spectators shouted: ``Shame! Shame!'' Several passers-byspat at a police car.   Another group of demonstrators, gathered on the southeast sideof Pushkin Square, was also repeatedly charged by riot police, whoignored the dozens of television camera teams and foreign reporterswho flocked there.   Police formed a flying wedge to charge young people gatheredunder a Gorky Street archway, and dozens were seized and dragged tothe buses.   The brutal treatement meted out to protesters was especiallyjarring because of the greater tolerance for dissenting points ofview that had seemingly become official practice in Moscow underMikhail S. Gorbachev.   In December 1987, about 200 men in civilian clothes roughed upJews who staged a protest demanding the right to emigrate on theeve of Gorbachev's departure for his Washington summit with RonaldReagan.</TEXT></DOC>
