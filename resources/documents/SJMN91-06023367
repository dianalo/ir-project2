It also helped him hook up with Paul, whoschedules his races each year.;    Gonzalez, 28, points to the U.S. NationalRoad 25-kilometer (15.525 miles) race in Michigan on May 11 as a barometer ofhis future.;    &quot;I want to see where I'm at. I'm gearing up for the (U.S.Olympic) trials in 1991. The race is a good indication of what I need to do.&quot;;   Paul, a former distance runner whose clients include 30 distance runners aswell as musicians and artists, believes Gonzalez's career is on the upswing.They met after Gonzalez won the 1986 California International Marathon inSacramento in two hours, 13 minutes.;    Agent saw him after big win;  &quot;It wasthe first prominent race I won, and Don asked if I was interested in havinghim schedule my races,&quot; Gonzalez recalled. &quot;At first, I said I wasn't becauseI felt I wasn't a high-caliber runner.&quot;;    But Gonzalez soon became moresuccessful, and he became overwhelmed by promoters who wanted him. So hecalled Paul, who was glad to help.;    &quot;He handles a lot of decisions,&quot;Gonzalez said. &quot;He doesn't look always at the cash prize. He looks at whatwould be beneficial for my long-term goals.&quot;;    This year, it's the U.S.Nationals.;    &quot;I would say Danny is on the comeback,&quot; Paul said. &quot;At the endof 1986, he was in a national class. He's still in that caliber. But lastSeptember, he got back into the kind of training that makes him stronger. It'sa groove.&quot;;    100-110 mile weekly regimen;  Gonzalez resumed his trainingafter a two-week holiday break. Regardless of the unseasonably cold (by BayArea standards), he estimates his weekly mileage at from 100 to 110 miles.;   &quot;I run anywhere from 13 to 16 miles a day,&quot; Gonzalez said. &quot;On weekends,probably 14 to 18 miles. It averages out to 15-16 miles a day.&quot;;    Gonzalezdoesn't have the rare luxury of picking a particular time to train. He holds afull-time job at Conner Peripherals, a company that produces disk drives.;   &quot;You have to make the time,&quot; Gonzalez said.;    &quot;If I can't do it in themorning, then I run at lunch time or after work. That's around 6 p.m., whenit's nice. Cold and dark,&quot; Gonzalez said sarcastically.;    It also helps whenyou have someone to train with.;    &quot;When you run by yourself, it's hard toget motivated.&quot;;    Gonzalez gets pushed by two training partners who alsowork full-time -- Mike Livingston and Charles Alexander. Livingston works withGonzalez at Conner, and Alexander, a former runner at Stanford, works atHewlett-Packard.;    He hit stride at Foothill;  Gonzalez got into the runninggroove at Foothill College during the early 1980s. He originally planned torun and &quot;figure out a topic of study&quot; at Foothill until he met coach PeanutHarms, now a shoe representative involved in negotiations with the CaliforniaInterscholastic Federation.;    &quot;Peanut kept me going past high school,&quot;Gonzalez said. &quot;He realized I had a future in running.&quot;;    His futurecontinued at San Jose State, where Marshall Clark (now an assistant athleticdirector) coached him.;    Under Clark, Gonzalez was an NCAA finalist incross-country and the 10,000 meters in 1984 and '85.;    In 1987, Gonzalez wonthe Mercury News' 10-kilometer race and finished second in a similar race atthe U.S. Sports Festival in Chapel Hill, N.C.;    But this is the year hehopes to elevate his standing among the nation's best distance runners.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARK GONZALES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910123  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  666  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 23, 199100023367,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
