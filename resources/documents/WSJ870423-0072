WinterStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WNEWS AT </IN><DATELINE> HUDSON, Ohio  </DATELINE><TEXT>   While Joe T. Ford was building a career from Yellow Pages salesman to telephone company president, he managed to put in 16 years as an Arkansas state senator.    Yesterday, Mr. Ford, a 49-year-old self-described &quot;Southern Democrat,&quot; was named chief executive officer of Alltel Corp. He says it is the only politicking he's interested in these days.    The executive, who speaks in a soft Arkansas drawl, admits he finds greater pleasure in shepherding a multimillion-dollar diversified communications business and telephone concern than in speechifying.    Mr. Ford served in the state senate from 1967 to 1982.    &quot;It's a part-time job,&quot; Mr. Ford says of his senatorial career.    But at Alltel, Mr. Ford might find himself hard-pressed to pursue politics these days anyway. He said he intends to continue to live in Little Rock and commute to Alltel corporate offices 30 miles southeast in Cleveland, while continuing to do some of his work at regional headquarters in his hometown.    Mr. Ford has been moving that fast since he began at Allied Telephone Co. in Little Rock in 1959, selling the Yellow Pages.    Steadily moving through the ranks of marketing, rate-making and acquisitions for the concern, he was named to the presidency in 1977.    Six years later, Allied Telephone merged with Mid-Continent Telephone Corp. to form Alltel. He now takes on the additional position of chief executive officer, succeeding Weldon W. Case, 66, Mid-Continent Telephone's founder.    Mr. Case, who will continue to serve as chairman of Alltel, forged his career in a similarly single-minded style. Founding Mid-Continent Telephone in 1960, he built it from five small Ohio telephone companies into a network serving nearly a million customers in 19 states.    Mr. Ford already is thinking about the future of the company, and predicts it will post a higher profit this year, saying analysts estimates of $3.80 to $3.90 a share &quot;probably are reasonable.&quot;    Like the politician he once was, he declines to disclose his own projection.    In 1986, Alltel earned $55.8 million, or $2.45 a share, after investment write-offs totaling $23.5 million after taxes. Before those write-offs, the company earned $79.3 million, or $3.55 a share.    Revenue was $697.1 million, about 78% of it from local telephone companies and the remainder from its diversified communications businesses.    Mr. Ford says he is interested in making further acquisitions, of both telephone companies and non-regulated communications concerns. Alltel currently has units that distribute telephone equipment, publish directories, operate wide-area paging systems and have interests in cellular telephone companies and fiber-optics long-distance networks.    &quot;We have nothing hot and heavy right now&quot; in acquisition prospects, he says. </TEXT></DOC>
