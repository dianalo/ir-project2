HIDLAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett visitedtwo schools here but said he saw nothing to change his assessmentof Chicago's system as the nation's worst, based on studentachievement on standardized tests.   ``Of course, there are successes here. Of course, there arepositive things going on that deserve recognition,'' he saidWednesday. ``But things are going to have to improve. We're goingto need more than a few success stories.''   Bennett visited an all-black elementary school in a crime-riddenneighborhood and an integrated high school at the invitation ofJacqueline Vaughn, president of the Chicago Teachers Union.   Last fall, Bennett said Chicago's public schools were sufferingan ``educational meltdown,'' and Mrs. Vaughn hoped to change hisviews with a look at what she called daily educational successes.   Bennett's first stop was Mary Terrell Elementary School, whereall the students in the upper grades are reading below their gradelevel, though scores have improved in the last year. The schoolserves the Robert Taylor Homes, a decaying public-housing project.   At William J. Bogan High School in a predominantly whiteneighborhood, Bennett visited a computer lab and an advancedalgebra class where he saw a teacher he later described asexcellent.   Bennett said he saw superb teachers at both schools and thoughtboth had good principals. ``But two schools do not a system make.The facts remain the facts,'' he said.   Earlier, he had cited problems with the nation's third-largestschool system that include a dropout rate approaching 50 percentand low standardized test scores. Half of Chicago's high schoolsranked in the bottom 1 percent of U.S. schools for scores on theAmerican College Test.   Mrs. Vaughn, sitting beside Bennett at a news conference afterthe tour, said a recent survey showed Chicago students ranked 20thout of 41 large urban school systems in scores on the ScholasticAptitude Test.   She said a survey of 21 large urban school systems found thatChicago ranked 16th for student performance on the ACT.</TEXT></DOC>
