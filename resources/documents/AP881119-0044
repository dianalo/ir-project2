Fighting began when riot police in green combat fatigues andblack, visored helmets blocked 5,000 dissidents, students andworkers who tried to march after a rally to call for Chun'spunishment for alleged corruption.   Students tried to force their way through police lines andtroopers used tear gas grenades to drive them back. Screamingprotesters then pelted police with hundreds of firebombs and showersof rocks.   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan. Oust (President) Roh Tae-woo,''protesters yelled as they battled unsucessfully to break throughpolice lines.   Protesters later reassembled in the center of Seoul where columnsof marchers paraded through the streets with banners and flags,yelling slogans and shooting their fists into the air.   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, estimated 12,000 peopletook part in the protests. Peaceful anti-Chun rallies were held inthe provincial cities of Chongju, Kwangju, Taego and Chonju.   Some protesters in Seoul yelled anti-American slogans, chargingthe United States had backed military rule in South Korea. ``Yankeego home,'' they yelled.   Riot police lining the streets intervened when thousands ofprotesters tried to approach City Hall. Police armored vans withmultiple tear gas launchers fired volleys of canisters into themarchers, sending people running to escape the choking fumes.   Students with firebombs and rocks attacked police buses, tryingto set them on fire before troopers drove them off. Other protesterstore up sidewalk paving stones to make rocks to throw at police andhurled firebombs.   Other large columns of protesters marched in other parts of thecity center, skirmishing a few times with police.   Authorities fielded 15,000 riot police in Seoul after dissidentgroups called for nationwide protests to demand the arrest of Chun.The former president has been accused of corruption and human rightsabuses and some of his associates and relatives have been convictedor charged.   Dissident leaders also called for the overthrow of President Roh,charging his government was a front for continued military rule.   Police had no word on arrests or injuries today.   Some onlookers cheered and applauded the protesters in Seoul, butmost people just watched silently as marchers passed by shoutinganti-government slogans and singing radical songs.   On Friday, aides of the former president said Chun willapologize, give most of his wealth to the government and leave Seoulin an effort to quiet public protests about his alleged involvementin corruption.   A four-day parliamentary hearing opened into Chun's role in thebloody suppression of an uprising in the southern city of Kwangju in1980.   One aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the formerpresident would announce his decision at a news conference nextweek. ``He will make a public apology, give up most of his wealthand live in seclusion somewhere in the countryside,'' the aide said.   Another said Chun would live in an isolated, rented house incentral South Korea instead of going to his hometown in the south,where he is no longer welcome. Living in rural seclusion is atraditional way of repentance for disgraced Korean leaders.   The mass-circulation paper Hankook Ilbo, quoting an unidentifiedgovernment source, said Roh is expected to pardon him if Chuncarries out the plan.   Nine members of Chun's family, including two brothers, have beenarrested on corruption charges. Chun is accused of amassing afortune and sending some of it for investment in the United Statesand Australia.   His wealth is not known, but one estimate has put it at $6million, including a $1.4 million home in Seoul.</TEXT></DOC>
