They'll work the Jungle Cruise but not the dishwasher; they'll consider running the boat on the Story Book Canal but not frying hamburgers.    And why not be picky? With unemployment in Orange County down to 3.4% this year, workers have their choice of jobs at boutiques, fast-food restaurants and hotels. To fill its annual quota of 4,000 casual workers and to get its dishes washed and its hamburgers fried, Disneyland stresses its clean-cut image, social opportunities and cachet on a future resume.    But one thing these workers aren't clamoring for, and Disney isn't offering, is sharply higher wages. Earlier this year, when California raised its minimum wage by 90 cents an hour to $4.25, Disneyland increased its starting wage by only 50 cents an hour to $4.75. And the Walt Disney Co. operation isn't planning any more increases. &quot;Money isn't the answer,&quot; Mr. Holst says.    Money doesn't talk very loudly elsewhere around the country, either. In Massachusetts, high-tech companies zap one another for computer programmers. Washington, D.C., hotels offer pots and pans to bounty hunters who bring in new housekeepers and dishwashers. Trucking companies chase a dwindling supply of drivers. Nurses are so scarce that one industry group estimates that more than 10% of all hospital positions go unfilled. Nationwide unemployment, at 5.4% in July, hovers just above its 14-year low.    In the past, such shortages have been associated with big wage increases. In 1979, for example, when unemployment was in today's range, overall wage rates rose 8.7%. But since the last recession, the rate of wage gains has steadily declined even as the labor market tightened.    Only in recent months have signs of greater increases cropped up. In the year ended last June, private-industry pay and benefits rose 4.5%, up from a 3% increase in the previous 12 months. Higher Social Security taxes accounted for part of the most recent rise.    And some economists caution that a number of forces could accelerate wage increases. A rise in the cost of living, perhaps due to higher food prices, could spur bigger wage demands. And if unemployment drops much further, these analysts contend, severe shortages of workers could force employers to pay more.    But so far, most economists say, the surprise isn't that wage gains have started to widen but that the increase is so small and so slow in coming. For nearly 2 1/2 years, a Data Resources Inc. economic model has predicted bigger wage increases than have actually occurred.    The reasons lie in a host of complicated economic trends. The memory of the deep 1981-82 recession haunts managers and workers alike. Price pressures from abroad keep companies worried about foreign competition. Cautious employers are more likely to add temporary and contract workers than full-time help.    The upshot: If inflation flames up again soon, labor costs aren't likely to add the usual amount of fuel. WEFA Group, an economic-consulting firm, had expected labor-cost pressures to start building right about now but recently pushed that expectation into next year. Barry Bluestone, a professor of political economy at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, also believes that labor-cost pressures are still &quot;a year or more away.&quot; When they next will turn into a driving force in the economy, nobody really knows.    Currently helping hold down wages is the raggedness of the economic expansion, now nearly five years old. Not all states have fared equally well. &quot;If you've been looking at states since 1982, it's difficult to find one that hasn't had a mini-recession,&quot; says Stanley Duobinis, WEFA Group's director of regional forecasting. He cites the Southwestern states, hit by the oil-price collapse, and New York, hit by layoffs after the stock market crashed. By contrast, some once-depressed regions, such as New England, are now booming.    In parts of Massachusetts, where the unemployment rate is 3.7%, a big employer such as Burger King is paying as much as $6 an hour for fast-food workers. But in a state such as Louisiana, with its double-digit unemployment, such workers get only the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage, says Roger Rendin, Burger King's human-resources director.    &quot;The regional labor-market tightness is extremely spotty,&quot; Mr. Duobinis says. Thus, service industries in labor-short states can often escape wage pressures by &quot;borrowing&quot; workers from high-unemployment states.    &quot;We aren't going to expand in an area where we have a tight labor market,&quot; says Donald J. Blankers, senior vice president of National Data Corp., an Atlanta-based company that handles bank-credit-card authorizations over the telephone and has 4,000 employees and offices in six cities. &quot;Technology is making it easier to get to areas where labor is more available. Before, there was a sense that you had to be in a metropolitan area or you'd lose out.&quot;    In fact, some service industries, like many manufacturers, are holding down labor costs by moving their most labor-intensive operations overseas.    In 1983, when American Airlines began having difficulty finding key-punch operators to handle ticket reconciliations, the AMR Corp. unit moved those operations to the Caribbean. One goal was to avoid raising wages. &quot;The airlines at that time, post-deregulation, weren't doing well, and everyone was looking for places to cut costs,&quot; a spokesman says. Since then, American figures that it has cut a total of $4 million from its data-entry expenses.    Even in the industrial Midwest, where demand for workers is being spurred by an export-spawned rebound in manufacturing, labor-hungry factories don't have to bid up wages to hire people. They frequently can draw from a ready pool of workers, left underemployed by past downturns and happy to resume earning factory wages.    For example, Larry Baughman, a machine operator, doesn't think twice about the two-tier wage system under which he earns 15% less than more-senior workers at Ford Motor Co. He's overjoyed to have been called back to Ford's Livonia, Mich., plant in June after being laid off during the 1980 auto slump. Under concessions granted by the United Auto Workers in 1982, his starting wage of $12.46 an hour will increase in three steps over 18 months until he catches up with senior workers. &quot;It's definitely OK with me,&quot; he says.    The reason is simple: Odd jobs and selling real estate over the past eight years never grossed him more than $17,000 a year. At Ford, with overtime, he has doubled his pay -- even at the lower starting rate. &quot;Now, we can at least be comfortable and get some extras,&quot; he says. &quot;Before, we were skimping and miserable.&quot;    Memories of such hard times continue to damp wages. &quot;We are still in some sense just getting over the recession psychosis&quot; of the early 1980s, says Prof. Bluestone in Boston. &quot;That period had a dramatic impact on the mind-set of workers. It took a lot of the upward wage pressure out of the economy.&quot;    Employers, too, well remember the 1982 slump and have ample reason for caution despite the long economic expansion. It's easier to raise wages than to cut them, comments Leonard Hausman, a Brandeis University economist, who adds: &quot;You make upward adjustments carefully because you can't go back again.&quot;    And unions have moderated their wage demands. So far this year, annual contractual wage increases for unionized workers are running at about 2.6%, far below the increases running as high as 11.9% in the 1970s. Economists cite several reasons unions' ability to negotiate big contracts has weakened:   --Declining union membership, brought on by the industrial depression of the late 1970s and early 1980s and exacerbated by an employment shift from highly unionized manufacturing to largely nonunion service industries. Only 17% of the country's workers were unionized last year, down from 24.1% in 1979.    --Deregulation, which has created new companies with lower-paid labor forces outside the union system. Between 1978 and 1987, a deregulated trucking industry spawned 34% more companies, and many of them are nonunion, the American Trucking Associations says. While many unionized drivers can earn about $50,000 a year, many nonunion drivers get roughly $30,000 a year, says Thomas J. Donohue, the trade group's president.    --Mergers and acquisitions, which frequently result in big debts that create &quot;a tremendous cash-flow problem&quot; and thus push companies to hold down wage costs, says Arthur Gundersheim, an official of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers' Union. With raw-material costs governed by a world market, &quot;the only big variable factor left is the wage cost,&quot; he adds. A Brookings Institution study shows 20% of companies' cash flow being used to service debt, up from 12% in 1969.    --Lower inflation. At a 4.2% annual rate, inflation is under greater control now than in the 1970s, when spiraling prices, stemming from cost increases such as the surge in oil prices, sent workers scrambling to protect their paychecks.    What's more, companies that have slashed work forces in recent years are more conservative with union and management employees alike. Between 1982 and 1987, Du Pont Co. cut its world-wide work force to about 140,000 from 177,000. Today, says Robert K. Armstrong, manager of professional recruiting, &quot;we're hiring at less than replacement rate&quot; -- with yearly starting-salary increases of 3% to 5%, down from 5% to 8% before 1983.    Where large entry-level wage increases are necessary, they are being made selectively. &quot;Before, companies would say that we can't have people here five years making the same as young whippersnappers,&quot; says Richard Belous, an economist at the Conference Board. &quot;Today, the attitude is, 'Tough. We have to raise wages for the entry level, but we're not passing it through the organization.'&quot; Says Jeri Beals, manager of employment services at Disneyland, which didn't pass starting-wage increases on to other workers: &quot;Our total work force here can be 8,500 or 9,000 people in the summer. That's a lot of money&quot; for across-the-board raises.    Moreover, the labor market may not be as tight as it appears. Since the early 1980s, companies have hired more and more contract and temporary workers. Audrey Freedman, a labor economist at the Conference Board, figures that such so-called contingent workers now make up as much as 25% of the entire work force. When labor demand increases, such workers are readily available for longer hours or more permanent arrangements.    At a recent congressional hearing, Mitchell Fromstein, the president of Manpower Inc., estimated that 40% of the company's employees are involuntary temporary workers and that a third ultimately accept full-time jobs. If that proportion holds for the rest of the million-employee temporary-help industry, an extra 400,000 workers are available for full-time work.    According to another theory, money matters a lot less than it once did in coaxing out new workers while other factors have grown in importance.    Transportation, for one. Many jobs go begging in hard-to-reach suburban areas while potential workers languish in central cities. This summer, Six Flags Great Adventure, a big amusement park in central New Jersey owned by Six Flags Corp. of Dallas, raised its wages and also began offering free transportation. &quot;It really boils down to having the people available to work no matter what you are offering,&quot; a spokeswoman says. &quot;If they can't get here, they can't work.&quot;    Burger King recruits workers in some locations by offering day care in lieu of higher hourly rates. &quot;It was a question of availability&quot; of the service, says Mr. Rendin of the Pillsbury Co. unit. &quot;More money just didn't do it.&quot;    And some affluent young people see work as a social experience or an entry on a resume. John Baumann, a college student, works as a sweeper at Disneyland for $4.75 an hour even though he could earn as much as $7 an hour as a courier. &quot;Disney is an excellent reference,&quot; says the 20-year-old, who hopes to become a stockbroker someday. &quot;That's more important than an extra $1 or $2 an hour.&quot;    Kelly Smith had hoped to find a marketing job, but, at 22 years of age, she was hampered by her lack of experience; so she sells &quot;jewelry, rubber knives, mugs, souvenirs, just about anything&quot; at a Disneyland concession. She earns about $145 a week, less than the $150 she makes cleaning houses on her two days off. But she, too, plans to stick around -- to meet people. &quot;Right now, money isn't important to me,&quot; she says. &quot;But I hate to be lonely.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
