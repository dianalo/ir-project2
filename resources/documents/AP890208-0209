It was the second consecutive victory in the hard-fought contestfor the 37-year-old Dutchman, who had luck on his side, just as inthe previous game, when he tied the match.   In Wednesday's encounter, he was never in danger of defeat, butchess experts said a draw was the most he should have gained.   Portisch played black in the Taimanov variation of the Siciliandefense and was clearly aiming for a peaceful outcome, which wouldhave caused the match to go into overtime.   He sacrificed a pawn and exchanged queens early on, simplifyingthe position until the two sides were almost completely evened out.   Timman had only a virtually worthless extra pawn and a slightspatial advantage to fight on with.   But fight on he did, taking risks that made Dutch grandmasterGenna Sosonko say, ``He might lose the game, and with it the match,if he goes on like this.''   It turned out to be part of Timman's strategy.   ``Just as in the previous game, it was my aim to terrorize myopponent by doing the unexpected,'' Holland's strongest chess playersaid afterwards.   Unable to stand the strain, Portisch nervously sought to createcounter chances. Experts said he should have resigned himself to apassive defense.   About 50 moves into the rooks and bishops endgame, the Hungarianmade the decisive mistake, allowing a white pawn advance on thequeenside.   Timman quickly concentrated his forces to support the lonely pawnand coasted to final victory on his 64th, when Portisch resignedunder the thunderous applause of the 200 spectators packing thetournament hall.   The victory earned Timman a berth in the semifinals, to be playedin October in London.   He will play Britain's Jonathan Speelman, while former worldchampion Anatoly Karpov takes on fellow Soviet grandmaster ArturYusupov in the other semifinal match.   The winner of the final, whose date and venue remain to bechosen, gains the right to challenge world champion Gary Kasparov ofthe Soviet Union.   Portisch meanwhile announced his withdrawal from the worldchampionship race.   He said he would continue to play tournament chess, but said that``at 51 and having competed in the Candidates series eight timessince 1964, enough is enough.''</TEXT></DOC>
