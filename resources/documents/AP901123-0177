Gardini, who had long sought to extend his control on Italy'schemical business through a takeover of Enimont, said Thursday hewould sell his 40 percent stake for about $2.55 billion to Italy'sstate energy group.   The stock is being sold to Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, alsoknown as ENI.   ENI already owns 40 percent of Enimont. Its bid to buyMontedison's 40 percent stake and increase its holding to acontrolling 80 percent ended a bitter 18-month battle betweenGardini and ENI officials.   ENI also offered to buy out minority shareholders to takecomplete control of Enimont.   Gardini, meanwhile, announced his resignation as chairman ofFerruzzi Finanziaria, the key holding company of theagro-industrial and chemical groups of the Ferruzzi family.   A statement said Gardini was leaving for ``ideological reasons''and would no longer ``participate in any Italian company orbusiness organization.''   ENI and Montedison formed Enimont in 1989 in an effort torestructure Italy's chemical industry, creating the world's 10thlargest chemical group with annual revenue of about $13.6 billion.   But squabbling over industrial strategy and managerial controldoomed the effort.</TEXT></DOC>
