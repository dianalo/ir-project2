Co can be substantiated: Merrill has some applications that it wants to putup on Unix servers supporting X-stations, and word out of the house is thatthe RS/6000 is not showing up well in the benchmarks; the problem seems to bethat while the machine with the vector graphics accelerator is extremelyimpressive, when it comes to pixel-by-pixel graphics used to put up windowedapplications for spreadsheets and such, the raw performance of the RS/6000CPU is dissipated when a large number of X terminals need to be supported -but then most IBMers will tell you that the thing is intended primarily as anengineering workstation and not for running commercial applications.andM;- o -andM;Ingres Corp's shares have been sliding since DEC walked away from a deal thatwould have given it a 25% stake in the company, signalling unease over thecompany's direction and uncertainty in wake of the ending of the DEC talks:from $8.875 on April 27, the shares had drifted to $6.375 at the end of lastweek; sales were up 39% for the third quarter, representing a substantialincrease in business over the first half of the year that ended last month,but the company, which had reported losses for the first half of fiscal 1990,only just crawled back into the black with $212,000.andM;- o -andM;Bidding for Datastream International Ltd, London has closed, with ReutersHoldings Plc, Citicorp, Dow Jones andamp; Co and Knight-Ridder Inc thought to be inthere and pitching for the firm, put on the block with Interactive Data Corpby present parent Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp; a price of around $275m is expected.andM;- o -andM;As part of Japan's national effort to mollify the Americans by using moreforeign chips, Sony Corp plans to increase its procurement of chips made inEurope: it is considering parts from Siemens AG, Philips NV, SGS-ThomsonMicroelectronics NV and European plants of Texas Instruments Inc and MotorolaInc.andM;- o -andM;Digital Microwave Corp, San Jose, has a $10m order for 13GHz and 23GHzdigital microwave radios and spares from Mercury Communications Ltd:completion is by September 30.andM;- o -andM;It's never possible to find anyone that knows the answer to such questions soidentifying new mainframes from NEC Corp requires a deal of detective work,and it now turns out that the new Acos 3800 is not a 36-bit GCOS 8 machine atall, but a 32-bit GCOS 7 machine - which raises the question why anyoneshould want to run a mid-range operating system on a 500 MIPS machine - it'slike IBM coming out with a six-processor Summit machine designed exclusivelyto run DOS/VSE: the reason that the Acos 3800 must be a Bull DPS7000-compatible monster is that, we now learn, it is designed to run theAcos-4 operating system and not Acos-6; NEC's two mainframe lines are derivedfrom the old Honeywell Level 64 - DPS 7000 predecessor, and Level 66 DPS 8000predecessor - and instead of using the Honeywell operating system names -which were GCOS 64 and GCOS III at the time, the Japanese took the Honeywellmachine numbers for its versions of the operating systems; although Bull hastaken some low-end models of the 32-bit NEC line for sale as top-end DPS 7s,it seems inconceivable that any GCOS 7 users will ever need the power of theAcos 3800; a top-end 36-bit GCOS 8-compatible variant in the same technologyis still awaited from NEC, but such a machine might well find a home at a fewDPS 90 sites such as Eastern Electricity.andM;- o -andM;The new NEC Acos 3800 implements an extended architecture called XSA and runsa new Acos-4 derived from Acos-4/MVP/XE and Acos-4/AVP/XR: there has longbeen speculation that NEC would one day follow Fujitsu and Hitachi in goingIBM-compatible and as a 32-bit machine derived from Level 64, which wasconceived as a universal emulator, it would be technically feasible to derivea 370-compatible variant of the Acos 3800, although software developmentcosts would be huge.andM;- o -andM;Mannesmann Mobilfunk GmbH is seeking permission from the East Germangovernment to extend its planned digital cellular network across theOder-Neisse Line, saying that if another carrier is licensed for theDemocratic Republic, its ability to compete with the Bundespost Telekom'snetwork would be compromised.andM;- o -andM;Kyocera Corp plans to manufacture laser printers for Europe at its AVX Corpacquisition's plant in Rouen, before the end of the year.andM;- o -andM;That auction of Sun Microsystems Inc machines (CI No 1,458) was of old 3/50,3/60, 386i and 4/280 workstations and the company reports that around 1,000of the mainly second-hand machines were sold as a result - the unsold oneshave been donated to various universities for research purposes: aspokeswoman for Sun said the auction, which included videoconference links toLos Angeles, Boston, Chicago and Atlanta, was &quot;an attempt to try somethingnew that was successful&quot; - Sun won't say, however, what net the proceedswere.andM;- o -andM;France Telecom's Telesystemes SA arm has formed a joint venture with theDatamont SpA subsidiary of Ferruzzi SpA: the venture, capitalised at $2.5m,will employ 250 and will offer software engineering and data communicationsservices, including turnkey systems, in Italy.andM;- o -andM;The European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association has asked theEuropean Commission to investigate alleged dumping of 256K and 1M memorychips by Samsung Electronics Co when the prices of Japanese chips were heldartificially high by the EC anti-dumping agreement.andM;- o -andM;Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka Shing, who owns Hutchison Telecommunications has soldhis 51.5m shares in Cable andamp; Wireless Plc, held through Hutchison Whampoa Ltd:according to the Evening Standard the 5.8% stake was placed withinstitutional clients at 518 pence a share by Smith New Court; Ka Shingbought the shares hoping to collaborate with Hong Kong Telecom Ltd overAsiaSat, but as this co-operation has not materialised he has liquidated hisholding - Cable andamp; Wireless shares fell 21 points to 527 pence on Friday.andM;- o -andM;Western Digital Corp has a new SCSI bus controller, the WD33C93B, whichsucceeds the compatible WD33C93A and transfers synchronous data at10Mbytes-per-second: it's sampling now but the company gave no prices.andM;- o -andM;OK, so the English, Irish and Scottish football teams may not have made it tothe World Cup final - who won, by the way? - but at least they didn't getthere by reasonably honest means, and British Telecom engineers are not asingeniously delinquent as their Argentinian counterparts - we kid you not:Argentinian telephone engineers steal peoples' phone lines and sell them tosomeone else on the black market, reconnecting the victim using someoneelse's phone line and leaving both parties to work out which call or fax orwhatever was meant for whom, all of which suggests that the Falklands War mayreally have started because some Generals got their wires crossed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
