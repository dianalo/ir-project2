The investigation sought by the House Committee on GovernmentOperations follows a complaint last November by six IBM competitorsthat they effectively have been frozen out of much of the Navy'smulti-billion-dollar computer market.   The GAO, Congress' watchdog arm, was asked to supply to thecommittee within 60 days a broad evaluation of the extent thatfederal agencies restrict their procurements to IBM``code-compatible'' systems.   Although many of companies offer ``clones'' or duplicates of IBMsystems at lower prices, they complained in a letter to formerDefense Secretary Frank Carlucci that Navy procurement officials hadtailored the bid specifications so that only IBM could win.   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the panel's chairman, citedgovernment statistics indicating that IBM currently holds almost 55percent of the Navy's large-scale computer base, compared with thecompany's 37 percent share government-wide.   ``The computer and telecommunications industry is one of thefastest growing and most highly compettive segments of the U.S.economy,'' Conyers said. ``Yet if these allegations are true, Navyofficials have apparently determined that only one company iscapable of meeting their needs.''   The committee also asked GAO to look in more detail atcode-compatible computer purchases by the Army, the NationalAeronautics Administration and the Health and Human Services andHousing and Urban Development Departments.   The General Services Administration, which supervises allgovernment purchases from vendors, was asked by the committee torescind blanket approval of Navy computer purchases less than $10million and strengthen its oversight.   Currently, the government requires GSA to approve any purchaseabove $2.5 million. But waivers raising the ceiling to $10 millionhave been given to some Navy commands.   With expenditures of some $17.4 billion last year on computer,communications and data processing equipment and services, thegovernment is the industry's largest single purchaser.   ``Faced witrh enormous budget deficits, Congress cannot sit idelyby while agencies needlessly waste scarce taxpayer dollars onsole-source contracts,'' Conyers said.</TEXT></DOC>
