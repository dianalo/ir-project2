We show that a highlypolarized vacuum around the source has at least two neutral oscillationmodes, whose energies are predicted to be 1.75 MeV and 1.49 MeV withan appropriate choice of the radius of the source. They decay into apair of e/sup +-/ only through electromagnetic interactions.</TEXT></DOC>
