The new designated methodis:EQL-1188-069, ``Determination of Lead Concentration in Ambient;Particulate Matter by Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma Optical;Emission Spectrometry (Northern Engineering and Testing, Inc.).''A notice of receipt of application for this method appeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, Volume 53, August 16, 1988, on page 30866.This method has been tested by the applicant, Northern Engineering andTesting, Inc., in accordance with the test procedures prescribed in 40CFR Part 53. After reviewing the results of these tests and other informationsubmitted by the applicant, EPA has determined, in accordance with Part53, that this method should be designated as an equivalent method. Theinformation submitted by the applicant will be kept on file at EPA's AtmosphericResearch and Exposure Assessment Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, NorthCarolina, and will be available for inspection to the extent consistentwith 40 CFR Part 2 (EPA's regulations implementing the Freedom of InformationAct).This method uses the sampling procedure specified in the reference methodfor the determination of lead in suspended particulate matter collectedfrom ambient air (43 FR 46258). Lead in the particulate matter is solubilizedby extraction with a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, facilitatedby heat and ultrasonication. The lead content of the sample is analyzedby inductively coupled argon plasma optical emission spectrometry usingthe 220.35 nm lead emission line and instrument conditions optimized bythe user laboratory. A sample of the extract solution is nebulized to forman aerosol which is excited with high temperature argon gas produced bypassing of argon through a powerful radio frequency field. Radiation emittedfrom the plasma enters a spectrometer where it is separated into selectedwavelengths and sensed by separate photomultiplier tubes for each elementof interest. The luminous energy thus measured is converted to an outputsignal which can be related to the concentration of each element of interestin the sample. Technical questions concerning the method should be directedto Northern Engineering and Testing, Inc., P.O. Box 30615, Billings, Montana59107.As a designated equivalent method, this method is acceptable for use bystates and other control agencies under requirements of 40 CFR Part 58,Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. For such purposes the method must beused in strict accordance with the procedures and specifications providedin the method description. States or other agencies using inductively coupledargon plasma optical emission spectrometric methods that employ proceduresand specifications significantly different from those in this method mustseek approval for their particular method under the provisions of section2.8 of Appendix C to 40 CFR Part 58 (Modification of Methods by Users)or may seek designation of such methods as equivalent methods under theprovisions of 40 CFR Part 53.Additional information concerning this action may be obtained by writingto Director, Quality Assurance Division (MD-77), Atmospheric Research andExposure Assessment Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ResearchTriangle Park, North Carolina 27711.<ITAG tagnum="6">Erich W.
