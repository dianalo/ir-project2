The U.S. took in more legal immigrants in the 1980s thanin any decade since the great wave of European immigration atthe beginning of the 20th century. The 1990s will see evenmore. The flow of illegal immigrants, diminished afterfederal law changed in 1986, appears to have resumed itsformer strength. Harvard University economist Richard Freemanestimates that immigrants -- legal and not -- now constitutenearly 10% of the U.S. labor force, almost double thefraction they represented 20 years ago.</LP><TEXT>   The inevitable question is whether this will be good forthe U.S. economy. Americans are firmly ambivalent. &quot;Whencontemplating immigration, the nation manages both tovenerate its immigrant ancestry and at the same time displayunease -- even alarm -- about the immigrants arriving on ourshores today,&quot; notes Raul Yzaguirre, president of a majororganization of Hispanics, the National Council of La Raza.                                                                                                          Some of today's ambivalence is rooted in racism. Many moreof today's immigrants are brown- or yellow-skinned peoplefrom Central America and Asia. Ironically, their tormentorsoften are the grandchildren of those who faced similarhostility in the past. The slurs directed at Mexicans,Salvadorans and Vietnamese today are echoes of those aimed atIrish, Polish and Jewish immigrants of an earlier era.                                                                                                          But anxiety over immigration cannot be dismissed as racismalone. For those workers whose wages have failed to keep upwith inflation in the past decade, particularly less skilledand less educated workers, the prospect of more competitionfor jobs is understandably frightening. What's good for theAmerican economy isn't necessarily good for all Americans.   The entrepreneurial zeal of some immigrants is a well-toldtale; to some, that's reason enough to view immigration as aneconomic plus. But most immigrants don't form softwarecompanies or even open fruit-and-vegetable stands. Most ofthem do work, though, if they can.   And America needs workers. For the first time in decades,the slowing growth of the U.S. labor force could prove to bea brake on economic growth. In the 1980s, one of every fournew workers was an immigrant, Harvard's Mr. Freeman says.With baby boomers now assimilated into the work force, thatfraction could climb.   In time, immigrants and their children will fill the gapsin the American labor market. But there's a catch. The tideof immigrants is increasingly made up of unskilled, littleeducated workers just at a time when demand for such workersin the U.S. is dwindling. &quot;The labor market has beenparticularly weak for unskilled workers and the increasedsupply of less skilled immigrants gluts the market,&quot; saysLawrence Katz, another Harvard economist.   With the commercial real estate bust, the most visibleevidence of the glut is in the vacant lots where constructioncrews pick up day laborers. In the building boom of the1980s, almost any willing worker got a job. Today, manylinger for hours before leaving without work.   Although the U.S. draws many college-educated immigrants,they represent a shrinking share of immigrants. &quot;If you lookat people who migrated in the late 1950s, on the day ofarrival they had about a year's more schooling than natives.In the 1980s, they had about a year's less,&quot; says economistGeorge Borjas of University of California at San Diego.                                                                                                          For immigrants -- particularly for men, who traditionallydon't end up in babysitting and house-cleaning jobs -- it'sharder to find good jobs. But they keep coming because, formost of them, life in the U.S. is still better, economicallyand politically, than it was at home.                                                                                                          It would seem to follow that the surge in immigration isalso depressing the wages of less skilled native workers, butlabor economists have been unable to prove this. At first,they compared wages in cities with lots of immigrants tocities with few immigrants and found no significantdifferences. But a quarter of all the workers in the U.S.without high school diplomas are immigrants; it's hard tobelieve that such a large increase in the supply of workershasn't pressed down wages for unskilled work. The economistsare rethinking their approach, and Harvard's Mr. Freeman, forone, expects a changed verdict.   The willingness of President Bush and Congress toliberalize immigration laws last year &quot;with the nation poisedon the brink of a recession&quot; is testimony to a faith in thewisdom of keeping the doors open, says Michael Fix of theUrban Institute. History justifies such faith.   The nation eventually may find, however, that the price isbeing paid by those workers least able to afford it.</TEXT></DOC>
