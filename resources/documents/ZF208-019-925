(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>New modem armyandM;While any communications package worth its disk space will performerror-correcting file transfers, real-time error-correction applied to everycharacter typed and received usually requires extra hardware and expense inthe modems at each end of the link.andP;  Of course, the doubling of throughputcan only occur with the right sort of data and a good-quality phone line.andM;The compression algorithms work best on graphics files, where there's alwaysa lot of run-length encoding compression that can be done, and on text fileswhere the Huffman frequency-based compression is particularly effective.andP;  Onwords-and-figures data like database or spreadsheet files the benefits areless.andM;There are some advantages to this approach.andP;  First is price, since it's muchcheaper to buy any of these packages than a new modem.andM;Second, modems using MNP Class 5 need to talk to their host computers athigher speeds than the speed of the phone line connecting them, since themodems provide higher data throughput between computers than the theoreticalphone-line speed.andP;  So with MNP Class 5 using modem hardware, the computersmust talk to the modems at at least 4800bps, although the modems talk to eachother at 2400bps.andM;This split-speed operation requires an element of hardware handshakingbetween computer and modem at each end, so that the modem doesn't get swampedby data from the computer.andM;With MNP Class 5 software, the modem-to-computer link can be run at the samespeed as the phone line, since the decompression and data unpacking isactually carried out inside the computer.andM;There are some problems, however.andP;  Performing MNP in software imposes anotherlayer of possible noise and timing errors -- between software, PC hardwareand serial port -- on top of any cable or phone-line noise and errors.andM;MNP negotiation, in which an error-corrected link and the highest possibleMNP class are established, is very sensitive to line noise and often fails inhardware MNP links.andP;  The review seemed to demonstrate that negotiation failedmore frequently with software-only MNP.andM;Then there are performance issues, since the receiving computer must use itsown processing resources to unpack and decompress the MNP packets itreceives, rather than using all of them simply to receive data and put it onthe screen.andM;This means that with a slightly noisy line requiring occasional packettransmission, and with a relatively slow host PC, the speed of screenupdating slows and the whole process becomes unpleasantly jerky.andM;The packagesandM;With Odyssey, MTE and Mirror III MNP, setting up an MNP connection is simpleonce the modem cable and the modem settings have been checked.andP;  But thatisn't necessarily a simple job, since MNP depends on various RS232 signalssuch as DTR and DCD operating in a particular way and common modems likeDowty Quattros don't always come from the factory with these configurationsset.andM;Eventually, the Quattro was configured correctly, with its internal MNP Class2 error-correction hardware disabled, hardware flow-control (RTS/CTS) enabledand DCD and DTR set.andM;OdysseyandM;Odyssey's main display looks like that of just about every othercommunications program, with a status line at the bottom of the screen, a rowof pull-down menus at the top and a blank terminal screen area in the centre.andO;The set-up menu controls every program parameter, including serial port andmodem configuration, display colours built-in editor set-ups and filetransfer protocols.andM;One command in the set-up menu can be used to enable MNP permanently, so thatOdyssey will attempt an MNP connection for every call.andP;  But since manydial-up services don't have MNP modems, it makes sense to enable MNPnegotiation only on calls to services that do.andP;  This can be done in theOdyssey dialling directory, where a column can be set up with a 'Y' for MNPsupport, an 'N' for no MNP, or an 'F' for forced MNP, so that no connectionis made unless an MNP negotiation succeeds.andP;  The level of MNP can also be sethere.andM;Dialling from the directory calls the selected number, establishes aconnection with the remote system and then negotiates for an MNP connection.andO;If this succeeds at Class 5, 'DCD' appears in the status line next to 'MNP5'and a line-quality indicator also pops up to give a warning if line qualityand hence MNP throughput is low.andM;It was very difficult at first to get an MNP connection with Odyssey, thefirst package tested, and every combination of modem settings was tried in anattempt to solve the problem.andP;  In the end it proved to be a flaky connectionin the special cable made up for the review and once this was fixed, Odysseyreliably made MNP connections as long as line noise wasn't too bad.andP;  For filetransfer, Odyssey scores highly, especially with its implementation of theZModem protocol, which is the fastest and most effective over an MNP Class 5link.andP;  When connected to a remote system that supports ZModem, like theCompulink Information Exchange (CIX), users only have to type in the name ofthe file to be downloaded and start the process going.andP;  Odyssey automaticallyrecognizes the ZModem header coming in, sets itself up to receive the fileand puts a transfer progress monitor up on the screen.andM;Using ZModem and MNP Class 5 over a 2400bps link, Odyssey downloaded a pureuncompressed text file at 325cps, rather than the theoretical maximum 240cps.andO;That cut transmission time from 16 minutes to around 11 minutes for a 237Kbfile.andM;Odyssey's implementation of MNP is unobtrusive, and works successfully andsmoothly.andP;  The package should be commended for allowing MNP configurations tobe put in the dialling directory, saving negotiation time on non-MNP calls;for the slickness and simplicity of its ZModem implementation; for the powerof its scripting language, resembling Modula-2, that can automate everyaspect of a communications session; and its two editors, one of which iseffectively a scroll-back editor for information that has scrolled off thescreen.andM;There are no user-interface frills, and those users who don't want to usescripts can simply type in a modem dialling command on the terminal screenand drive the session directly.andP;  But for most purposes, Odyssey does theright things very well indeed.andP;  It's just a shame that the manual doesn'tlive up to that.andM;MTEandM;MTE looks very similar to Odyssey on screen, except that the status line isat the top and the menus are not pull-down but pop-up.andP;  It's assumed that MNPis enabled all the time, and typing in a dialling command in Terminal mode --entered by pressing 'T' from the main menu -- attempts an MNP negotiationautomatically.andP;  Alternatively, MNP configuration can be done in the diallingdirectory, as in Odyssey, with 'Y' and 'N' as well as '2' and '4' settings toenable and disable MNP and set the maximum class level to attempt.andM;Once an MNP connection has been made, MTE indicates this with an 'MNP5' labelin the status line.andP;  A further indication is given at the right-hand end ofthe status line, where the receive and transmit speeds are constantlydisplayed.andP;  If these are both the same, at 2400bps in the Quattro's case,then MNP isn't active.andP;  If the receive figure is higher than the transmit, at3600bps or similar, then MNP Class 5 is in action.andM;Again, the speed of screen updating depended on line quality and on machinespeed, but as MTE does not give a line-quality display it was hard to decidewhich had more effect.andM;Certainly, on the 10MHz AT clone MTE looked jerkier, although on the 16MHz80386 there was no visible difference.andP;  File transfer speed, too, was prettymuch the same at 323cps for the same ASCII text file used for the Odysseypackage.andM;The method of file transfer, however, isn't as painless and easy to get goingas Odyssey's.andP;  Even though the version of MTE reviewed supported ZModem --despite what the manual said -- it had to be set up like any other protocoltransfer, and getting started took longer than it did with Odyssey.andP;  Thiscould possibly explain the 2cps speed difference.andM;But if MTE and Odyssey are comparable when it comes to MNP, MTE falls behindas a communications program.andP;  It has no built-in editors, although it canshell-out to DOS and load an editor of the user's choice with the Alt-Acommand.andM;It only has two terminal emulations, TTY and VT102, while Odyssey has sixincluding Prestel.andP;  Most important of all, is that it has no scriptinglanguage.andM;For someone whose communications needs are very simple indeed, but who needsMNP Class 5 for faster file transfer, then MTE is fine.andP;  Those with a moreambitious approach should look elsewhere.andM;Mirror III MNPandM;As an add-on, Mirror III MNP works like other add-ons such as the ACTCompressor standard -- which provides data compression between copies ofMirror III -- and the Prism programming language, which goes way beyond beinga simple scripting language for automating log-ons.andM;Once installed and entered in the MIRROR.CFG file, the MNP module is loadedautomatically when Mirror is started, and is always active unless the userexplicitly turns it off with the MN OFF command on Mirror's usual commandline.andM;This means that MNP can't be set up in the configuration file for aparticular service, so that users must remember to turn it off for non-MNPsessions and then turn it on again afterwards.andM;Moreover, MNP is only used if the Mirror dialler is used, since it's anadd-on to the GO command.andP;  Typing a dialling command in GO LOCAL mode doesn'twork.andM;Typing the MN command produces a simple status line message saying 'MNPEnabled', 'MNP Disabled', or 'MNP Active'.andP;  This can be handy if anotherMirror III MNP package is at the other end of the link, since in this caseMNP can be turned on and off at any time during a communications session, andthis message enables users to check its status.andM;With a hardware-MNP modem at the other end, this isn't possible.andM;In action, Mirror III with MNP Class 5 active -- something that had to bechecked with MN, since there's no status line indication -- seemed slower andjerkier than the other two packages in screen updating.andP;  The file transferwas slower too, since Mirror III doesn't support the ZModem protocol, andalthough it does have YModem-G, not every communications service knows aboutthis streaming version of YModem.andM;Mirror III, however, has a lot of other things in its favour, including: theincredibly flexible Prism scripting language; its ability to run in thebackground while other programs run in the foreground; its superior Prestelemulation and its overall general presentation and performance.andP;  The MNPadd-on is clumsy compared with MTE, and especially with Odyssey, but it doeswork and makes this attractive package even better.andM;It also, unfortunately, makes it much more expensive.andP;  Those who want MNP andwill settle for less functionality should go for Odyssey, which is verycheap; particularly considering the quality of its script language.andP;  Userswho want bare-bones communications with MNP error-correction and compression,but little else, could try MTE.andP;  Those who want a full-blown communicationspackage that has MNP as an option, rather than as a prime selling point,could look at Mirror and prepare to shell out for the quantity as well as thequality of features.andM;In all three packages, it was surprising how well MNP Class 5 in softwareworked.andP;  Once the connection is made, it's fast and not noticeably jerkierthan normal communication, although operating on a 4.77MHz 8088 might changethat impression.andM;Making the connection can be trickier, since MNP is sensitive to line noiseduring negotiation, but that seems a very small penalty to pay for thebenefits of losing all line noise while on-line.andM;USER VERDICT PRODUCT NAME Odyssey SUPPLIED BY Micropack, Berryden BusinessCentre, 12 Berryden Road, Aberdeen.andP;
