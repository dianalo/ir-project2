They may not live in Washington, where political figures of both parties are loath to suggest that increased taxes are the way to bring the federal deficit under control, but they are flourishing in Tallahassee, Santa Fe, Jefferson City and Bismarck.    In these state capitals and others -- 30 in all, a remarkably high number -- plans have been approved to increase the state tax burden for fiscal 1988. So as the nation's governors meet here this week amid the orchards and hardwood forests of northwestern lower Michigan for their annual conference, the talk is of how they have grown more aggressive and shown the fiscal discipline their colleagues in Washington have shunned.    &quot;A lot of this is the difference between rhetoric and reality,&quot; says Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, chairman of the National Governors' Association. &quot;Reality is the world the governors live in.&quot;    Governors seldom resist the impulse to disparage Congress and the White House as conscientious objectors in the war against the deficit; Democratic Gov. Gerald Baliles of Virginia won nods of agreement from governors of both parties when he said &quot;the best Washington can do is stand tall and duck.&quot; But this time there is unusual bite to the criticism. Net tax increases on the state level add up to $4.6 billion for fiscal 1988.    &quot;We either cut or pay, and we tend to pay,&quot; says newly elected Republican Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida, which just instituted a controversial tax on services, including most legal and accounting fees and advertising.    Part of the increased burden on state taxpayers is a direct result of the federal tax overhaul passed last autumn. That massive adjustment in the federal tax code gave states that tie their taxes to federal law a huge revenue windfall -- and 20 states kept at least part of that windfall to help defray rising operating costs and to meet demands for a new burst of state activism, especially in trade and education. &quot;The need to improve education -- everyone agrees on this today -- has changed the tax debate,&quot; says Republican Gov. Kay Orr of Nebraska, one of a half-dozen states that raised the state income tax beyond the federal windfall.    But increases in the burden of state taxes can be attributed entirely to the tax windfall in only six states. In 24 states, legislatures approved new taxes or passed increases. Three states raised corporate income taxes by more than the windfall, five states increased sales taxes and two significantly broadened the sales tax base.    A number of tax increases are now in effect in the depressed commodity-producing states of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain West. &quot;When you get hit with a recession,&quot; says Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota, which raised corporate income taxes, &quot;you have to do something to make up the difference.&quot;    All this activity on the tax front comes in the face of the accepted Washington wisdom that politicians who raise taxes also raise the likelihood that they will face defeat in the next election. &quot;This is a big puzzle,&quot; confesses Roy Bahl, a Syracuse University specialist in state public finance. &quot;It's an era when people want less government, and yet a lot of states are raising taxes.&quot;    Some experts believe the unusual growth of taxation on the state level is a sign that the tax revolt, which has dominated American politics for the past dozen years, may be on the wane. &quot;Democrats in Washington are oversensitized to the tax issue,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a Republican political theorist. &quot;There's more support for taxes than they realize, and the governors are in the fiscal real world and are past worrying about what happened to Walter Mondale.&quot;    As a result, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a number of states raised excise taxes -- 10 raised cigarette taxes, 13 raised motor-fuel taxes and five raised alcohol taxes -- and a handful of others raised miscellaneous taxes, such as Nevada's casino tax. Only nine states cut the net tax burden on their citizens.    &quot;Governors and state legislators aren't known as being overwhelmingly supply-side,&quot; says Richard Doernberg, an expert on taxation at Emory University. &quot;They're in the business of government, and they like collecting money. We should never be surprised when taxes go up.&quot;    Some tax-cut advocates, in fact, argue that the states that raised taxes will find that the price of tax increases is diminished long-term economic health. &quot;I say to the states that raise taxes: 'Good luck,'&quot; says Alan Reynolds, a supply-side economist. &quot;There's a lot of evidence that excessively greedy states lose people and business to their neighbors.&quot;    For that reason, governors like Republican Carroll Campbell of South Carolina are pleased when other states raise taxes. &quot;I'm trying to keep South Carolina competitive,&quot; says Gov. Campbell, who vetoed business taxes three times in his first six months in office in Columbia. &quot;My supply-side blood's still flowing.&quot;    The governors, however, are searching for ways to avoid new taxes next year, when 10 of them are likely to face re-election battles. They approved a resolution Sunday calling for federal legislation to permit the states to collect the $1.5 billion in state taxes being avoided by customers of large out-of-state mail-order concerns.    But a number of the governors meeting here on an 18-mile inlet of Lake Michigan said the tax increases in their states were a response to depressed local economic conditions; the Texas Legislature, for example, last week approved a $1.5 billion tax increase for fiscal 1988 to help ameliorate a state fiscal crisis prompted by the decline in the oil industry. And an Academy for State and Local Government study found that states were feeling new economic pressures as the national economy continued its transformation from a heavily industrial orientation toward the service sector.    &quot;There's a willingness in states to move taxes up when you need to and then to move them down very, very quickly,&quot; says Republican Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire, the only state without a broad-based tax. &quot;Most governors are supply-siders given the opportunity.&quot;    The 45 governors meeting here are accustomed to operating on a financial landscape far different from the one that governs the behavior of the federal government. One form or another of a balanced-budget requirement applies in every state but Vermont. &quot;There's a very significant difference between policy making on the state and federal levels,&quot; says John Shannon, executive director of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental relations. &quot;State governors and legislators operate in a much more disciplined environment. They don't have the luxury of taking the easy way out.&quot;    The governors acknowledge that balanced-budget requirements and the line-item veto -- tools that President Reagan has asked Congress to provide him -- help keep them fiscally honest, even in an age when Reagan administration budget cuts have increased the financial burden on the states. But they also speculate that it's easier to raise taxes on the state level than on the federal level.    &quot;People can see the immediate needs on the state level,&quot; says Gov. Orr of Nebraska. Adds Republican Gov. Michael Castle of Delaware, where the motor-fuel tax was increased for fiscal 1988: &quot;When people think about taxes, they think about W-4 forms. They don't think about state taxes, so it's easier to increase them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
