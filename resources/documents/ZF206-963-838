Tustin, California in a pact valued at $3m a year.andM;In an announcement that succeeds in revealing almost nothing useful about theproduct, Sunnyvale, California-based Zymos Corp says it has a &quot;revolutionary&quot;video colour display controller chip that can be used in any existing MS-DOSmicro and in any other video display application such as on-line stockexchange monitors, airline reservation and travel industry terminals, desktoppublishing system, high-end workstations, on-line database systems,information retrieval systems used by stockbrokers, estate agents, bankersand wholesalers.andM;MegaScan Technology Inc. Gibsonia, Pennsylvania manufacturer of &quot;the world'shighest resolution computer graphics displays&quot;, has tapped Data GeneralCorp's US Manufacturing chief Vahram Erdekian to be its president and chiefexecutive: he replaces co-founder Brian Rosen, who retains his post aschairman.andM;ACTC Technologies Inc. Calgary, Alberta, is to receive $16m from its ownerHoneywell Bull over the next five years to develop tools which will enableHoneywell's Multics operating system customers to migrate to its new SecureUnix sys-tem: Honeywell says the first beta tested version of Secure Unix isnow ready, to B1 C2 security level.andM;New, low-cost plastic packaging for its 250nS NMOS DSP32 digital signalprocessor is enabling ATandamp;T Microelectronics Inc. Berkeley Heights, New Jerseyto slash prices for the part by almost 65%, it says: the DSP32 is now $49 for1,000-up, making it &quot;the lowest priced 32-bit floating point chip on themarket&quot;; it will be sampled next quarter with production quantities in thethird quarter; the DSP16 falls 36% to $25.50 for buyers of 5,000-up.andM;Turns out that the new Sequoia Systems Inc Sereis 200E fault-tolerant Unixmachine is based on two 68020 processors (CI No 1,092), but the company saysthat a 68030-based Series 300E will follow it along in March.andM;Amidst claims of providing easier IBM network management, Hewlett-Packard Ltdhas announced a new software package for use with its 4954A ProtocolAnalyser; called the 18371A SNA Network Performance Analyser, the applicationpresents in-formation on three levels to assist managers in daily monitoring,probspotting, and capacity planning, and offers programmable alarms foradditional trouble shooting: the analyzer costs $901, and should be availablewithin four weeks.andM;Low cost MS-DOS micro manufacturer, Walters International Ltd says it is ontarget for a profit of #14m for the year to December last, says salesdirector Edward Moir - and having just closed a contract with the RoyalBorough of Kensington and Chelsea, the High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire-basedcompany looks for a prosperous 1989 to follow suit.andM;Sun Microsystems Inc has opened a subsidiary in Madrid, saying the demand forUnix stations in Spain now warrants the move.andM;Computer-aided design, manufacturing and engineering industry sales andprofit soared in 1988 according to market research company Daratech Inc.andO;Combridge, Massachusetts - it expects last years figures to reveal an 18%growth to $5,300m, up by 9% from 1987: Sun, Apollow, DEC And IBM are said tohave done best in the market surge - but the boom seems to have done littleto stem the rash of mergers and acquisitions in the industry; The CAD/CAM,CAE Survey, Review and Buyer's Guide costs $495 from Daratech Inc.andM;Gazelle Microcircuits Inc. Santa Clara, California filed a motion in USDistrict Court, San Jose, alleging that Advanced Micro Devices Inc's patentrelated to the Am22V10 logic device, which Gazelle is accused of infringing,is invalid: Gazelle has already countersued, alleging fraud on the basis thatthe patent is invalid in light of a prior AMD product, and it wants punitivedamages of $50m and costs, dismissal of the AMD complaint, judgement that thepatent is invalid, and an injunction against all persons, especially AMDsalespeople, from charging it with infringement; Gazelle says it has awritten and signed declaration from the first-named inventor on the AMDpatent, Paul Harvey, which states that, had he known of the Am9513 outputstructure, said to be near identical to the aspect of the Am22V10 thatcarries the patent, he would not have applied for the patent as it nowstands; an enraged Gazelle says &quot;AMD should know that there is no basis for asuit, but it filed the suit anyway as an attempt to scare our customers andinvestors - we feel that the lawsuit has absolutely no merit, is an improperuse of the patent law and wastes the capital of all the parties involved,&quot;adding that &quot;it is ironic that Jerry Sanders, who is championing the ideas ofthe patent process, would allow his organization to abuse that process byfiling apparently unfounded lawsuits and by seeking patents through seeminglyfraudulent methods&quot; - and if all that fails, a Billy Bunterish Gazelle addsas aandP; rejoinder that &quot;even if the patent were valid and enforceable, it isnoteworthy that the Gazelle devices do not use the output circuit that waspatented.andM;Metaphor Computer Systems Inc has added gateways that enable users of theMetaphor Data Interpretation System to access databases on Teradata DBC/1012computer and Oracle Corp databases on DEC VAX computers directly, so thatusers of either can take advantage of the full range of Metaphorinterpretation capabilities, from data entry and access, to analysis,presentation and application development that so appealed to 10% shareholderIBM: the hardware and software Teradata Gateway transmits commands generatedby the Metaphor software and puts retrieved data into Metphor format, andcosts from $65,000 to $205,000, depending on the number of users and theprocessing powr of the Teradata system; Oracle VAX systems are $35,000 to$75,000.andM;Unisys Corp is expected on Wednesday to unveil what the Wall Street Journalcalls &quot;a breakthrough in tiny computer&quot;, cramming an processor sale to runall A series mainframe software into a ceramic part that measures 2&quot; by 2&quot;:Ulric Weil at Weil andamp; Associates said the machine would be &quot;a breakthrough -nobody has anything like this&quot;, although he expects that other companies willfollow with similarly miniature machines later this year; the paper quotesindustry executives saying that the desktop machine will be faster than thepresent bottom-of-the-line A1, but cost $40,000 against the A1's $100,000.andM;Sun Microsystems Inc says that its low-end 80386-based Sun-386i workstation,announced back last May, has now clocked up sales of $100m.andM;Luis Solana relinguishes the chairmanship of Telefonica de Espana SA tobecome director general of the Spanish state broadcasting authority RTVEtoday: no successor has yet been named at the phone companyandM;Us holders have now garnered 37% of the issue of Racal Telecommunications P1cshares made last October: Recal Electronics P1c of course holds 80% of thetotal, but another 7.41% is now in the hands of Bank of New York's BN!andO;(Nominees) and Racal has no idea whether the nominee account shields justone, or hundreds of holders of ADRs, American Depository Receipts in thecompany; shares in foreign firms that are traded in New York as well, areusually held by Americans in the form of ADRs, a convenience created to avoidthe need for share certificates to wing their way endlessly back and forthacross the Atlantic.andM;Next Inc. Fremont, California, sent out 200 Next Computer Systems by the endof 1988, to some 10 US universities - although as version 0.8 models theysound like pre-production machines; they included the Write Now wordprocessor and a beta version of the NextStep software.andM;Italian state telecommunications holding company Stet SpA has been jugglingsome of its shareholdings with other state bodies that, like it, come theumbrella Istituto per la Rrecostruzione, IRI: it has sold 90% of Italy's 50%of the SGS Thomson Microelectronics BV chip joint venture to its parent IRIand the other 10% to Finmeccanica SpA state heavy engineering company, whichalso bought its 50.19% of air traffic control, radar and defence systemsmanufacturer Selenia SpA, its 51% holding in software developer Opti.ME.SSpA, and interests in two instrumentation businesses; all the sales broughtin a total of $461m.andM;Bell Atlantic Corp's Chesapeake andamp; Potomac Co has been awarded the $220m10-year Washington Interagency Telecommunications Service contract to linkmost of the US government agencies in the Washington area with a moderndigital telephone system that will enable each to control its own phone anddata costs: it was the sitting tenant, but the General ServicesAdministration looks for a $40m saving over the 10-years of the pact, whichincludes links to the long-distance FTS-2000 system being built by ATandamp;T Coand US Sprint Communications.andM;Telecom Australia is claiming the first nationwide Integrated ServicesDigital Network in the world with its public system which is built around anL M Ericsson Telefon AB AXE exchange, and was developed by the InformationSwitching Technology joint venture between Telecom Australia and Fujitsu Ltdwith help from NEC Corp and Jtec Pty: demonstrated at the beginning of theyear, Macrolink service is planned to begin in the middle of the year,providing users with 30 64Kbps channels and one 64Kbps signalling channel; acomplementary Microlink is planned for the mid-1990s, offering two 64Kbpsdata and more 64Kbps signalling channels.andM;Oh dear, perhaps Prince Philip should have an indiscreet word or two with thenew incumbent when he attends Emperor Hirohito's disconcertingly delayedfuneral next month: according to Observer in the Financial Times, althoughthe name Heisei chosen for the new Japanese era mean &quot;peace attained&quot;, theelements &quot;hei&quot; and &quot;sei&quot; used singly represent &quot;flatten&quot; and &quot;the west&quot;.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
