Time said it holds 13,389,764 shares, up from about 30%, or 9,660,826 a year ago, a spokesman said.    Time said it increased its ownership in Turner through dividends, stock purchases from Ted Turner and other investors and the impending merger with Warner Communications Inc. In the filing, Time said all the additional stock it acquired in Atlanta-based Turner is for investment purposes.    Much of the recently acquired Turner stock carries fractional voting power, or none at all, so Time's increase in control of Turner subsequent to the merger and these stock acquisitions is quite small, a spokesman explained.    Adding the recently purchased Turner shares and factoring in those owned by Warner Communications, Time will have an 18.1% stake in Turner and 8.35% of voting participation, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
