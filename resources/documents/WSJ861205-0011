Moody's said it reduced ratings on convertible debentures of Apache Corp. to Ba3 from Ba1 and on convertible debentures of Apache Petroleum to single-B-2 from single-B-1. Apache Corp. is managing partner of Apache Petroleum, which is an oil and gas master limited partnership.    The rating concern said the reductions were prompted by Apache's &quot;aggressive&quot; acquisition of reserves during a time of &quot;extremely volatile&quot; oil and natural gas prices. Moody's said this resulted in a more highly leveraged capital structure and reduced protection against fixed costs.    An Apache Corp. spokesman said the company made &quot;what we believe are attractive acquisitions at a time we think is excellent.&quot; He said Apache is &quot;fully capable&quot; of meeting its debt obligations.    Meanwhile, Apache Corp. also said it and Apache Petroleum refinanced about $160 million of bank debt through institutional investors.    It didn't disclose details, but the spokesman said that as a result, the company no longer plans to offer a total of $100 million of subordinated debt and preferred as previously announced.    Apache Corp. said the new financing enabled it to trim its bank debt $60 million, to about $172 million, and the bank debt of Apache Petroleum to $210 million from $310 million. The spokesman said Apache is negotiating for more institutional financing to further pare bank debt. </TEXT></DOC>
