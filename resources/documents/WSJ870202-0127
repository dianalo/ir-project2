The committee said they retained Allen andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. to advise them on any prospective bid.    Shamrock Holdings of California Inc., Burbank, and Brookehill Equities Inc., New York, said last month that they may make an offer to acquire Holly. Shamrock Holdings recently increased its stake in Holly to 6.8% from 5.5% of shares outstanding. Brookehill and two affiliates hold about 10.6% of Holly's 1.1 million shares outstanding.    In December a group of investors that includes Holly's chairman, Michael Buschbaum, proposed to take the company private in a leveraged buyout. The group, Arcanum I, offered $35 and one share of newly issued preferred stock for each Holly common share. Shamrock Holdings and Brookehill have indicated they could better the proposal.    Holly asked the committee, composed of the company's outside directors, to consider the management group's bid and to seek other offers.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Holly shares closed at $105.75, off 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
