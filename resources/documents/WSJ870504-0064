In South African rand, sales rose 47%, to 5.91 billion rand.    DeBeers controls the supply and marketing of about 80% of the world's diamonds through its marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization.    In 1986, demand for the selling organization's rough diamonds matched the output of its sources around the world for the first time in many years, the marketing arm said.    The selling organization raised its prices for rough diamonds twice last year -- an average of 7.5% last May and 7% in November, it said.    DeBeers attributed the increase in rough diamond prices largely to the substantial decline in the dollar against other major currencies.    Sales growth stemmed from a recent marked improvement in world-wide diamond sales and strengthening demand for high-quality gems, DeBeers said.    Diamond sales will continue to rise strongly the rest of this year, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
