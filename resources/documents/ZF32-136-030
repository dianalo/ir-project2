(Product introduction).andO;Product:   Systech One Step Enhanced DCP-8820 (Front-end processor) (Productintroduction).andO;Topic:     Product IntroductionCommunications EquipmentWide Area NetworksCommunications controllers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>San Diego, CA based Systech Corp. has announced the availability of itsenhanced data communications processor (DCP) 8820 product for the wide-areanetwork marketplace.andM;Like its predecessor, which was introduced in 1984, the Enhanced DCP 8820provides all the hardware, firmware and optional software necessary to allowVMEbus systems to communicate with IBM and compatible computers and publicdata networks through a variety of interfaces.andM;The latest version of the Systech product features four interfaces, each ofwhich is available on any of four channels.andP;  In addition to the RS-232 andRS-422/RS-449 modules which were on the earlier DCP, separate plug-inpersonality modules for V.11 and V.35 connectors are also available.andM;The V.11 and V.35 interfaces allow access to additional wide area networks,such as fractional T1 and Public Data Networks.andP;  V.11 and V.35 also permitdirect connection to equipment which could not be effected with the RS-232and RS-422 interfaces.andP;  The V.11 and V.35 interfaces are becomingincreasingly popular in Europe and in IBM installations worldwide.andM;The board can be configured with any of these four modules in any of the fourports.andP;  The modular design of the Enhanced DCP 8820 also assures easyimplementation of any additional future interfaces.andM;Systech's Enhanced DCP has been specifically designed to provide fasterchannel speeds.andP;  It offers a high-performance interface between a VMEbuscompatible computer and up to four serial data communications links.andM;The design includes an 8 MHz 80186 microprocessor with 512 Kb of zerowait-state RAM with parity, 64 Kb of DPRAM, maximum line speeds of 1.6Mb/sec., two 8350 serial communication controllers and two 8237A DMAcontrollers allowing full DMA on all ports plus DMA to the host memory.andM;The Enhanced DCP board itself has been redesigned, utilizing the latest insingle-sided surface-mount technology, to offer increased reliability andeasier testing.andP;  Although all parts have been moved to the top side of theboard, the functionality of the enhanced board is fully interchangeable withprevious DCP versions.andM;Christy Joiner-Congleton, DCP product manager for Systech, commented that theproduct enhancement was in response to requests from Systech's broad OEMcustomer base.andM;&quot;Our customers articulated their requirements very thoroughly,&quot; she said.andO;&quot;Systech has met these needs with a cost-effective product that boasts a newboard design and a total of four port modules which allow instant `snap-in'configuration of the board in any of four channels.&quot;andM;Charles L. Citron, Systech's marketing director, observed that the productchanges are well-timed for the current market.andP;  &quot;Although our wide-areaproduct has been a significant part of our product line for the past sevenyears, we have witnessed accelerated growth in the marketplace over the last12 months.andM;&quot;The product refinements we are now announcing will solidify our position andoffer our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers a strong productthat will satisfy their current needs.&quot;andM;Citron also stated that the company has further plans for its datacommunications processor line.andP;  &quot;Right now we are evaluating additionalupgrades to the product.andP;  I expect that we will be announcing the first in anew series of enhancements during the first quarter of 1992.&quot;andM;Systech is a pioneer in the design, manufacture, marketing and support of awide variety of high-performance communications subsystems to originalequipment manufacturers (OEMs) worldwide.andM;Systech products allow computer manufacturers and systems integrators tobring their products to market faster and enable their computers to &quot;talk&quot; toterminals and printers, or to serve as remote concentrators, nodal processorsor communications gateways in wide-area networks.andP;  The company maintains itsheadquarters and manufacturing facility in San Diego with sales offices inthe United States and Europe.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
