BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said Thursday that ``I willcampaign for voter registration and voter turnout in every statethat I can get to'' for the Democratic ticket.   Jackson denied that aides to Democratic candidate MichaelDukakis had tried to keep Jackson from campaigning for Dukakis insome states.   ``I have seen no such list,'' Jackson told reporters aftermeeting with Dukakis campaign officials on a joint voterregistration effort.   He said he will concentrate on reaching farmers, trade unionistsand students.   ``In some instances we'll speak directly for, as a surrogatefor, the ticket,'' Jackson said, while elsewhere he will representthe Democratic Party or his own ``rainbow coalition'' wing of theparty.   He said he would ``focus so hard'' on those groups because ``Iwould hate to wake up on the morning of Nov. 9 (the day after theelection) and hate to think that we lost by the lack of my work.''   Jackson, the civil rights activist and former Dukakis rival forthe party's nomination, said the transition toward a unifiedcampaign ``in some states has gone very well, in some states it isincomplete.''   Jackson predicted that ``the remaining areas of incompleteness''will be resolved in the next few days.   Some of the 70 party officials and campaign workers from theSoutheast who attended the meeting attributed reports of allegedrestraints on Jackson's campaign appearances in some states totensions arising from the merger of the Dukakis and Jacksonorganizations.   ``There are always problems during a campaign ... but I haven'tseen any evidence that a great divisiveness exists,'' said Jacksonadviser Bert Lance, former White House budget director underPresident Carter.   The meeting Thursday was called by Jackson to discuss voterregistration. But Joseph Gardner, director of operations inJackson's Chicago office, said in advance that he expected thegroup to discuss the extent to which Dukakis has fulfilled hispledge to bring Jackson supporters into his campaign.   Sources close to Jackson had said Wednesday that he was angeredbecause Dukakis aides had told him to avoid campaigning inMichigan, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, New York andAlabama.   ``I have no knowledge of that,'' Jackson said on NBC-TV's``Today'' show Thursday.   Dukakis said in California that he would meeting with someleaders of the Jackson campaign who ``are already becoming a veryimportant part of our campaign'' in that state.   Gardner said transition problems were serious in Georgia, wherethe Rev. Cameron Alexander, a Jackson supporters, took his name offthe list of nine co-chairmen of the state Dukakis campaign,charging that the state party was giving only token attention toblacks.   Larry Harrington, Dukakis' Southern political director whoattended the meeting here, said the party had made ``a significantand a successful effort'' to involve Jackson supporters at alllevels of the campaign.   ``I don't really think there's a serious problem. But if he(Jackson) identifies some problems then we'll work with him,''Harrington said.   Others at the meeting, including Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., andBobby Kahn, executive director of the Georgia Democratic Party,denied suggestions of a rift.</TEXT></DOC>
