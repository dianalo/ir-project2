Promises EISA Support on WorkstationsandM;NEW YORK -- Hewlett-Packard Co. last week became the first company to promiseExtended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus support for technicalworkstations without Intel Corp. processors, and it is emphasizing UNIX for anew Intel 486 EISA PC.andM;The company announced the 25-MHz Vectra 486 PC.andP;  HP officials said it willperform up to one-third faster than a 33-MHz 386 computer.andP;  Thefloor-standing, tower-style machine should be available in volume in January.andM;Robert Puette, general manager of Hewlett-Packard's Personal Computer Group,said federal government interest in the new computer is likely to center onits capabilities as a small multiuser computer or local area network server.andM;A single 486 PC can handle 64 terminals, and the company will sell UNIXSystem V/386 products from the Santa Cruz Operation, Santa Cruz, Calif., torun the new systems.andM;Computer-aided design will be another big area for the machine, Puette said.andM;Hewlett-Packard officials said the company will support EISA on its HP/Apollotechnical workstation family.andP;  The new system will be an additional option tothe VMW and DIO II I/O buses currently available.andP;  Expect delivery in thefirst half of 1990, officials said.andM;EISA specifications are an attempt to standardize on a high-performancereplacement for the industry standard architecture used in IBM Corp.'spopular PC XT/AT line.andM;The proposed standard evolved through agreements by 200 companies, includingHewlett-Packard, Zenith Data Systems Corp., Compaq Computer Corp., ApolloComputer Inc. and Microsoft Corp.andP;  It is considered as the biggest competitorof Micro Channel Architecture, found in IBM's PS/2 computer line, in the raceto establish a new standard.andM;EISA is a 32-bit extension of the 8- and 16-bit industry standardarchitecture.andP;  EISA takes advantage of the higher performance capacities of386 and 486 microprocessors.andM;The standard Vectra 486 PC has 2M of RAM, expandable to 64M.andP;  Users candesignate memory as expanded or extended.andP;  System software options includeMS-DOS 4.01, Microsoft Windows and Windows/386 as well as OS/2 and UNIX/386System V 3.2.andM;The unit has six half-eight data storage shelves and includes eight 32-bitEISA input/output slots.andM;The Model 150 computer comes with a 152M drive and will sell for $13,999.andO;The Model 330, substituting a 330M drive, will sell for $16,999, and theModel 670, with 670M of storage, will be $19,999.andM;Contact HP's Steve Jursa, tel.andP;  408-447-1679.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
