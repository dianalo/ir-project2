A description is provided ofthe market and economic factors used by natural-gas utilities and industrialend-users to evaluate the potential for onsite storage utilization. Adiscussion of the current storage related Randamp;D activities is presented.A sensitivity analysis of various investment and operating parametersto indicate the potential for cost reductions was made. The economicsensitivity analysis is made using a generic capital recovery and operatingcost analysis methodology. Potential areas for Randamp;D on natural gas storageand peak shaving are recommended.</TEXT></DOC>
