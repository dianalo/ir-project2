Before the crisis, the low-key Brady tended to pale incomparisons with his predecessor, James A. Baker III, now secretaryof state.   But in spearheading the government effort to prevent the Crashof '87 from repeating itself, Brady is winning praise for defthandling of the situation.   ``It was clear that the government stood prepared to helpprevent a repeat of that 508-point debacle,'' said Allen Sinai,chief economist of the Boston Co. ``The policymakers all said theright things and helped to contain any problems.''   When the market dropped 108 points on a Friday two years ago, itfollowed with a 508-point plunge the next Monday. This time,Friday's 190-point decline was largely offset by an 88-point risethe next Monday.   That success notwithstanding, Brady hinted in an interviewFriday that he may soon recommend several steps aimed at promotingmore coordination among regulators. He would not be specific aboutwhat changes were being considered.   In a free enterprise system, government policymakers are notnecessarily concerned with imposing rules that inhibit the normalebb and flow of market forces. But they are concerned when otherfactors _ particularly those unique to the high-speed, computerdriven trading of the modern era _ threaten to undermine oroverwhelm the more natural forces.   In addition to directing the fact-finding operation that insureda supply of accurate information upon which to base decisionsduring the market plunge earlier this month, Brady worked to havegovernment policymakers from the president on down speak with onevoice to project an air of calm.   This time, there was no verbal gaffe to worry markets, such asthen-SEC Chairman David Ruder's comment to reporters two years agothat trading might be halted, a remark widely believed to have ledto further panic selling.   Other key roles were played this year by Federal ReserveChairman Alan Greenspan, who also navigated the shoals of the '87crash, Gerald Corrigan, head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank,and Richard Breeden, the new chairman of the Securities andExchange Commission.   But Brady, who took the lead in the crisis-management effort,and his top aides at the Treasury Department are coming in for muchof the congratulations for avoiding a repeat of Black Monday.   Reviewing events during the interview in his office, Bradyplayed down his own role, saying policymakers were better preparedthis time around and armed with more sophisticated means ofmonitoring market developments.   Brady was on hand Monday morning watching the flashing signalsthat tracked developments in the stock markets, stock futures,international currency and bond trading not only in the UnitedStates but in markets around the world.   For Brady, market monitoring was nothing new. He spent 35 yearson Wall Street as an investment banker. He also headed the BradyCommission, the panel which issued the first and, many believe, thebest review of the causes of the record 508-point market plunge onOct. 19, 1987.   In addition, the two Harvard professors who directed the Bradycommission investigation are now working as top aides to Brady atthe Treasury Department.   Known as the ``gold dust twins,'' Robert Glauber, Treasuryundersecretary for finance, and David W. Mullins, Treasuryassistant secretary for domestic finance, are considered experts onthe operations of financial markets.   When the market began tumbling late in the afternoon on Oct. 13,Brady turned to these two aides to launch a fact-finding operationthat continued throughout the weekend.   In 1987, when the stock market fell 108 points on the Fridaybefore Black Monday, the response was far different. At that time,Baker was in a highly publicized feud with West Germany overinternational economic coordination.   Baker's pointed criticism of interest rate increases in WestGermany, which he continued through that weekend, unnervedinvestors and were considered extremely ill-timed given thevolatility in the markets.   This time, Brady and others in the administration went out oftheir way to emphasize that U.S. officials were in closeconsultation and coordination with major U.S. allies.   The Federal Reserve did its part by letting it be known that itstood ready to inject large doses of cash into the banking systemas a way of assuring jittery markets that cash-short brokeragehouses would not have to sell off more stock because they could notget bank loans.   The Fed under Greenspan performed the same function in 1987 butonly after the huge Monday sell-off had occurred. By getting wordof its intentions out over the weekend, the Fed helped remove amajor area of uncertainty.   Behind the scenes, Treasury's fact-finding operation was turningup some encouraging signs that 1989 would not be a repeat of 1987.   For one thing, there were technical signs in the trading datasuggesting that computer trading programs that had been harmful in1987 would not be a factor this time.   In another turnaround from 1987, checks with 24-hour mutual fundhotlines indicated no rush on the part of investors to sell theirholdings.   Armed with this information, Brady convened a meeting in hisoffice late Sunday with Greenspan, Breeden and various aides toreview plans for the Monday morning market opening.   In an effort to avoid any sense of panic, Greenspan kept ascheduled speech Monday morning before the American BankersAssociation while Brady attended the regular 7 a.m. White Housestaff meeting to counsel calm.   His message: ``You shouldn't look at this loss on Friday as somecataclysmic event but more (as) an instantaneous technicalreaction'' to a market that was somewhat overvalued.   ``I don't think anybody had an air of panic,'' Brady says inassessing the mood as the markets opened Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
