Talks to amend the union's three-year work agreement are to begin within a week in Miami. They represent the first contractual confrontation between Eastern's unions and the managers of Eastern and its parent company, Houston-based Texas Air Corp.    While Eastern is determined to shrink paychecks for the union's 11,000 members, the unions have been just as determined to hold the line.    Reducing labor costs is the highest priority Eastern officials have set in their plan to return the carrier to profitability. According to a recent stock prospectus, labor costs represented 39% of Eastern's operating expenses last year, compared with 24% at non-union Continental Airlines, another unit of Texas Air.    Eastern President Philip Bakes insisted in January that the unions accept an average of 29% in pay cuts; the unions dug in their heels and refused to reopen their contracts.    Yesterday, Eastern outlined a more specific proposal to cut union salaries to &quot;marketplace&quot; wages, and to create a separate contract for about 6,000 baggage handlers and plane cleaners, who would be faced with the biggest pay cuts.    Under the proposal, for example, baggage handlers who now earn $15.60 an hour would earn $10 an hour on the effective date of the contract, and $8 an hour two years later. Newly hired baggage handlers and ground service employees would be paid $5 an hour.    Mechanics who now earn $18.63 an hour would be paid from $14 to $18 an hour, depending on their tasks.    &quot;What's driving this is the market rates, as opposed to looking at the current relationships between the groups,&quot; said Thomas J. Matthews, vice president of human resources at Eastern.    The machinists' union, he noted, didn't accept the 20% wage reductions the flight attendants and pilots unions did two years ago. The machinists' contract becomes amendable Dec. 31, while agreements governing other employee groups expire next year.    Charles Bryan, the resolute head of the machinists union since 1980, said he doesn't consider Eastern's announcement to be a firm proposal because it would scrap, rather than amend, the current agreement. &quot;We don't acknowledge they have given proposals,&quot; he said.    Mr. Bryan said he plans to fight the proposal to separate the union into divisions of unskilled and skilled workers. &quot;We've all been under the same collective bargaining agreement for 45 years, and that's how we intend to keep it,&quot; he said.    As part of its plan, Eastern said it would create a $100 million program for workers who wanted to learn a higher-paying job skill at company expense.    Eastern management is battling a union that has scored some impressive victories over Texas Air recently. The machinists recently won a court fight, which Eastern is appealing, to enjoin the company from creating a separate, low-cost ground-service subsidiary.    And the machinists were among the employees who fought a Texas Air tender offer for a class of stock owned by employee trusts. A federal court temporarily restrained the employees from tendering their shares until fiduciary responsibilities of the trusts are clarified.    Moreover, the machinists are vowing unity, pointing out that the controversial Mr. Bryan was recently re-elected to his post by an 88% majority, his highest margin ever, becoming the first president elected to a third consecutive term.    Eastern has been successful in cutting costs in other areas. Its financial results have represented an unexpected bright spot for Texas Air this year, while Continental has suffered steep losses associated with its mergers of People Express and New York Air.    For the second quarter, Eastern had a $27.1 million profit, not counting $14.6 million in preferred dividend requirements, compared with a year-earlier loss of $44 million. Continental had a deficit of $71.1 million in the second quarter, compared with a $56.8 million loss a year earlier, which included a $58.2 million charge for costs associated with its emergence from a three-year period in bankruptcy-law proceedings. </TEXT></DOC>
