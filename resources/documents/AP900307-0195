Bill Alexander, D-Ark.   A House source, speaking only on condition he not be identified,provided the same information about the committee decision on theGeorgia Republican.   The panel _ formally the Committee on Standards of OfficialConduct _ met behind closed doors Wednesday but made noannouncement.   Gingrich's case has generated keen interest because he filed theethics complaint that triggered the investigation _ and eventualresignation last year _ of former Speaker Jim Wright.   A Chicago law firm hired to provide the committee advice on theGingrich case reportedly told the panel late last year that therewas insufficient evidence to pursue the investigation.   Alexander, who filed two separate complaints against Gingrich,called the committee action ``a practical resolution of theGingrich matter. Futher disciplinary actions against Mr. Gingrichare therefore not needed at the present time.''   Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley said his boss would notimmediately comment on the committee decision because there hadbeen no formal notification from the panel.   In a complaint filed with the committee last October, Alexandersaid that Gingrich failed to make the required disclosure of thepurchase of the home with his daughter in Fulton County, Ga. inJune 1986.   The complaint said that Gingrich's annual financial disclosureforms beginning in 1986 failed to report the home purchase, failedto list the property as an asset and failed to list the $77,800mortgage as a liability.   Members do not have to disclose financial information abouthomes they live in, but Gingrich said last year this home was forhis daughter.   At the time, Gincrich said he was ``incensed that the fact thatI helped my daughter by co-signing, or signing the note, orwhatever one calls it, gets drug out and becomes a story.''   He said Alexander's decision to include his daughter's mortgagein the complaint ``carries politics in the House to a new lowlevel. I mean it just strikes me as madness.''   Alexander triggered the Gingrich probe last April with acomplaint that the No. 2-ranking House Republican violated violatedHouse rules and federal campaign finance laws in the operation of alimited partnership created in 1984. The ``COS LimitedPartnership'' promoted ``Window of Opportunity,'' a book written byGingrich and two others.   The partnership was made up of 21 individuals who each put up$5,000 to promote the book. Gingrich was not an investor, but hiswife, a co-author, was paid more than $10,000 for running theoperation.   The complaint contended the $105,000 raised by the partnershipcould be considered income to Gingrich, in violation of Houselimits on members' outside earnings, or it could constitute a giftto Gingrich, in violation of House rules that prohibit members fromaccepting gifts worth more than $100 from anyone with a directinterest in legislation.   The compliant also contended that if the money were consideredto be campaign contributions, Gingrich would be in violation ofreporting obligations and restrictions under campaign finance laws.   The second complaint, filed in October, charged Gingrich with along list of alleged campaign finance and financial disclosureviolations.</TEXT></DOC>
