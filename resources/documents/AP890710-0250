More than 500,000 town hall staff throughout Britain planned a48-hour strike for Tuesday and Wednesday, and unions said thenational rail service and London's subway system would again grindto a halt on Wednesday.   British Rail said 120 of its 500 morning rush hour trains werecanceled in its busy southern region surrounding London because ofthe overtime ban by the 17,500 members of the Associated Society ofLocomotive Engineers and Firemen.   A spokesman said one in three scheduled trains did not arriveMonday morning at Waterloo Station, London's main rail station southof the River Thames, and 17 percent of trains were not running intocentral London's Victoria Station.   Leaders of all three railways unions, the engineers, the NationalUnion of Railwaymen and the Transport and Salaried StaffsAssociation, were scheduled to meet Monday to discuss their disputeswith British Rail over pay and bargaining arrangements.   British Rail has imposed a 7-percent pay raise on the Transportand Salaried Staffs Association, which represents 30,000 whitecollar workers.   The Railway Staff National Tribunal, the industry's arbitrationbody, has recommended that it be increased to 8.8 percent, closer tothe national average wage settlement of 9.3 percent. The associationis the only one of the three rail unions to participate in thetribunal.   If British Rail approves the tribunal's recommendation, it mustthen decide whether to offer the 8.8 percent increase to all its130,000 employees.   General Secretary Jimmy Knapp of the National Unions ofRailwaymen has already said that 8.8 percent is ``way below thetarget we are seeking.'' His union is seeking a 10-percent raise.   The Transport and General Workers Union said 9,400 dockworkerswould begin an indefinite strike at midnight Monday over theabolition of a scheme which guaranteed them jobs for life.   Employers fear the disruption at 40 ports could hurt exports andimports, and worsen the country's merchandise trade deficit.   A year-long strike by Britain's miners in 1984-85 was far morebitter than any of the current disputes, but had less impact onindividual Britons.   In this summer's mounting labor unrest, strikes have regularlyclosed passport offices, idled London's red double-decker buses andblacked out programs on the British Broadcasting Corp.   North Sea oil workers are involved in rotating strikes over payand safety, and ambulance workers and water industry workers havescheduled votes on industrial action.   The five million London commuters who rely on trains and subwayswill have to find other transportation on Wednesday if, as planned,London Underground Workers stage their 10th stoppage in 14 weeks andBritish Rail is shut down for the fourth time in four weeks.   The subway workers want a 64-pound, or $104 a week raise tooperate trains without guards. Management has offered 30 pounds, or$49, plus extra vacation, but is demanding increased productivity.   The Department of Employment said 256,000 working days have beenlost due to strikes this year up to April, the latest month forwhich figures are available. Nearly 30 million working days werelost during the 1979 winter of discontent which helped Mrs. Thatchersweep to power.</TEXT></DOC>
