These are bonds issued by brokerage firms either for themselves or on behalf of financial institutions. Brokerage firms create them by putting Government National Mortgage Association bonds, or Ginnie Maes, and similar securities representing government-guaranteed mortgages into a trust. The sponsor then issues CMOs backed by the trust. Those with shorter maturities generally are sold to institutions, while longer-term issues often are sold to individuals.    Institutional investors like CMOs primarily because they typically provide more predictable income than other mortgage securities. But that isn't always true of the CMOs sold to individuals. The newest breed for retail investors, companion CMOs, is even less predictable than more common types of mortgage securities -- a fact that is discernible only through the fine print in the prospectus.    &quot;Retail CMOs are a mine field for the average investor,&quot; warns Kurt Brouwer, a San Francisco investment adviser.    Wall Street firms began designing CMOs for institutional investors in 1983. While the retail variety has been around for only about two years, they have caught on quickly: Individual investors bought $194 million of them in this year's first half, according to Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    CMOs have much lower minimum investments than mortgage securities: $1,000, compared with $25,000 for Ginnie Maes. Because the secondary market is much thinner than for Ginnie Maes, CMOs also offer higher yields. Currently, the projected yield is about 9.75% on a 30-year CMO with an average life of 10 to 12 years, depending on the pace of mortgage refinancings. That is about half a percentage point higher than the advertised yields on comparable Ginnie Maes.    Despite the higher returns, the credit quality of CMOs &quot;is nearly identical,&quot; to that of Ginnie Maes, says John Cejka, manager of fixed-income research at the St. Louis-based brokerage firm A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc.    But CMOs also have negative attributes for investors. For one thing, CMOs and Ginnie Maes share the risk of early redemption stemming from faster-than-expected mortgage refinancings. Typically, CMO investors get their principal back in one of two ways. Some issues return it in small amounts with investors' interest payments, just like Ginnie Maes. But many other CMOs direct all principal paid by the borrower to a redemption fund. In that case, the CMO trust randomly calls investors' bonds at par as the principal accumulates in the redemption fund.    &quot;They're not good if you have to have your money back in exactly two years or 10 years,&quot; says Steven Plausteiner, head CMO trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. &quot;You can't get away from the uncertainty of calls in mortgage bonds.&quot;    The big risk with CMOs, however, comes with the new breed of securities -- called &quot;companion CMOs&quot; -- that brokerage firms are now promoting for individual investors. These CMOs are junior to other bonds in the same issue designed to provide steadier income to institutional investors. These companion CMOs serve to shield the institutional holdings, known as planned-amortization class bonds, against interest-rate moves.    &quot;You're taking some uncertainty out of one class of bonds and transferring it&quot; to the companion issues, says Bowers Espy, executive vice president of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Capital Inc. in New York.    Moreover, it isn't always easy for an investor to tell what he's getting. &quot;The prospectus will point out that some of the other bonds in the trust are (planned-amortization) classes that receive set principal amounts first,&quot; says Mr. Plausteiner. &quot;But realistically, you have to rely on your broker to tell you that that means your bonds are going to be subject to more volatility.&quot;    Holders of companion CMOs can lose whether interest rates rise or fall. If interest rates fall, the companion issues are even more likely than other mortgage securities to be called. That's because the prospectuses stipulate that they be called before the institutional bonds in the same issue, allowing the institutional holders to continue receiving their regular payments. For individual investors in companion CMOs, &quot;the prepayment risk inherent in all mortgage securities is magnified,&quot; says John Hague, a portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, Calif.    Assuming a given drop in interest rates would prompt enough mortgage prepayments to shorten the life of a Ginnie Mae by six months, says Mr. Hague, &quot;the same drop might shorten a companion CMO by two years.&quot;    A big increase in interest rates would hurt companion-CMO holders by lengthening the lives of their bonds more than those of the institutions' bonds. In this case, any prepayments would be steered to institutions, which could then invest the proceeds at the higher prevailing rates.    To compensate holders of companion CMOs for their risk, projected yields are perhaps one-quarter percentage point higher than on other CMOs. Even so, &quot;you're better off in Ginnie Maes or Treasury bonds,&quot; Mr. Hague says.    Such &quot;cash-flow engineering&quot; is so appealing to institutional investors that planned-amortization bonds accounted for $38 billion of the $60 billion of CMOs they purchased in the first five months of this year, Goldman Sachs says.    Because these bonds can't be created without companion issues, individuals are likely to hear more about those CMOs from their brokers, several bond specialists say. Last month, a $200 million offering from Merrill Lynch included $82 million of companion CMOs, while Prudential-Bache issued $23 million of such bonds as part of a $250 million offering.    Individuals will soon be able to invest in planned-amortization CMOs through a mutual fund run by Huntington Advisers Inc., of Pasadena, Calif. The initial public offering raised $10 million last month. The fund, to be sold through brokerage firms when it reopens Sept. 6, will have a 3% sales charge and a minimum $1,000 initial investment.    ---                      How CMOs Compare                   Collateralized                   Mortgage                      Treasury                   Obligations     Ginnie Maes   Notes  Minimum  investment       $1,000          $25,000       $1,000  Yield*           9.75%           9.25%         9.05%  Interest         monthly or  payable          quarterly       Quarterly     Semiannually  Principal        At maturity,  returned         monthly or                   quarterly       Monthly       At maturity   *Based on 30-year CMOs and Ginnie Maes, with average lives of 10-12 years, respectively, and 10-year Treasury notes.
