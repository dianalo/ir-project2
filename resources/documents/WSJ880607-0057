Michael Dukakis barely knew Sen. Bill Bradley and Rep. Lee Hamilton six months ago but now consults them regularly. He is beginning to forge a relationship with House Majority Leader Thomas Foley and talks with him about twice a month.    But two of the three contenders for Senate majority leader have never had a personal conversation with him. He talks with House Speaker James Wright, but the two men don't have a natural rapport. And although he met with a large group of Southern lawmakers last month, they remain uneasy with him.    Still, the Massachusetts governor is making a stronger effort to acquaint himself with Capitol Hill than Jimmy Carter did in 1976. And while this early mating dance with Congress won't have much to do with Mr. Dukakis's prospects of winning the presidential election in November, it could influence his ability to govern if he does prevail against Vice President George Bush.    &quot;If you don't get started on the right foot, you're dead,&quot; says Richard Fenno, a University of Rochester specialist in the politics of Capitol Hill. &quot;A lot of this is the sort of personal campaigning you have to do in Iowa. There are a lot of people with big egos and you have to give them a piece of you and give them some stake in what you're doing.&quot;    So far, however, Mr. Dukakis has sought out the sort of personalities he would be more likely to encounter in a graduate-school seminar than on the courthouse steps -- cerebral rather than emotional, pragmatic rather than ideological. There are few doctrinaire liberals or Dixiecrats.    The conversations with lawmakers center on regional economic development, the centerpiece of the governor's three terms in Massachusetts, and on foreign policy, an area in which many Capitol Hill figures regard Mr. Dukakis as inexperienced. As he prepared to react to the Reagan-Gorbachev summit last week, he shared a copy of his thoughts with a half-dozen members of Congress, including Senate Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn of Georgia, Rep. Hamilton of Indiana and Sen. Bradley of New Jersey.    Mr. Dukakis counts two old friends in the Senate, Carl Levin of Michigan, who was a student at Swarthmore College when he was, and Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, who was a classmate at Harvard Law School, and the governor has a good, though not especially warm, relationship with the Massachusetts congressional delegation. But so far his reception on Capitol Hill has been polite but not enthusiastic, and the lawmakers who may hold the key to the success of his administration if he becomes president still need to be convinced that he is prepared to work more closely with Congress than Jimmy Carter did.    &quot;He can't come down here with the suspicion that this is an evil place and that he brings truth, goodness, integrity and ideas of how everything should work,&quot; says Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He adds, in a reference to two other governors who became president, Ronald Reagan and Mr. Carter: &quot;We have had a Republican fool and a Democratic idiot with that approach and you have to avoid that at all costs.&quot;    Much of the skepticism about Mr. Dukakis grows out of lawmakers' worry about his discomfort with legislators -- a longtime adviser says Mr. Dukakis always regarded his years in the Massachusetts House as &quot;boot camp&quot; he needed to become governor -- and their memories of the bitter relationship they had with President Carter.    &quot;There's a long way between good intentions and fulfilling them,&quot; says Rep. Leon Panetta of California, who will be the next chairman of the House Budget Committee. &quot;Those of us who experienced the Carter administration know to discount good intentions if, in the end, you can't put them into effect.&quot;    Although he is on the threshold of the nomination, Mr. Dukakis still claims the support of only about half the members of Congress who will be Democratic convention delegates. He hasn't, moreover, made inroads into several key congressional delegations; until last week, only two Democratic congressmen from Texas had endorsed him and now that he is about to wrap up the nomination, 13 of the state's 17 Democratic congressmen still haven't endorsed him. Sen. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, both candidates to be Senate majority leader, have breezed by him at social events but neither has had a personal conversation with him.    Despite his efforts, the man who has spent his entire political career under the golden dome of the Massachusetts State House on Beacon Hill is still a stranger on Capitol Hill. &quot;It wouldn't hurt the guy to reach out,&quot; says Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama. &quot;We don't know him here.&quot;    As he has moved closer to the nomination -- he is expected to clinch it in today's primaries in California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico -- Mr. Dukakis has embarked on an offensive to dispel fears that he wouldn't seek cooperation with Congress. These fears are based largely on the stormy relationship he had with the Massachusetts legislature during his first term as governor.    &quot;These are lessons you learn, sometimes painfully,&quot; he says in an interview. &quot;I learned some things in my first term.&quot;    So in the past several weeks, Mr. Dukakis has begun wading into the political world of Capitol Hill. He has consulted Rep. George Brown of California on technology issues, Rep. Les AuCoin of Oregon on natural-resource issues and Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota on regional-development problems.    Before he wrote a letter to President Reagan about the veto of the trade bill, Gov. Dukakis consulted with House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia and Speaker Wright. He has discussed foreign affairs with Rep. Howard Wolpe of Michigan, pro-sanctions chairman of the Africa subcommittee, and Rep. Mel Levine of California, a member of the Middle East subcommittee and a leading advocate of Israel.    &quot;We've got to know these people,&quot; says Nicholas Mitropoulos, a longtime Dukakis aide, &quot;because we might be in a position to give some of them jobs someday.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis has told the legislators that he intends to consider them partners. &quot;We will not undertake a major policy initiative,&quot; he says, his index finger pointing, &quot;without involving key members of the House and Senate from the beginning.&quot;    Some who remember Mr. Dukakis's disputes with the Massachusetts legislature doubt he will have good rapport with Congress if he is elected. Former Rep. Michael Harrington, a Dukakis ally in the Massachusetts House before being elected to Congress in 1969, predicts the relationship &quot;will never be warm, easy or accommodating.&quot; He adds: &quot;It will be a test every day.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
