For more than 35 years, North Korea had demanded that thetwo Koreas seek a joint membership of one seat, believingthat separate seats would perpetuate the division of theKorean peninsula. The South Korean government said earlierthis year that it would seek separate membership despiteNorth Korea's objections and the risk that China might vetoits U.N. application.</LP><TEXT>   The announcement, regarded by the South Korean governmentand Western and Asian diplomats as genuine, is a victory forSouth Korean diplomatic efforts. The South Korean governmenthad been lining up support for its position around the world,including from North Korea's closest allies. A South Koreangovernment spokesman said, &quot;We sincerely welcome NorthKorea's decision,&quot; noting that it would &quot;greatly contributeto easing tension on the Korean peninsula and also facilitatethe process of peaceful unification.&quot;   The North Korean announcement, monitored in Seoul, saidthe North &quot;had no choice&quot; but to apply because a single SouthKorean membership would cause &quot;important issues related tothe interests of the entire Korean nation to be dealt with ina biased manner.&quot; The dispatch, attributed to the NorthKorean Foreign Ministry, added, &quot;We can never let it go thatway.&quot;   In Washington, the State Department announced U.S. supportfor North Korea's bid. &quot;U.N. membership for both Koreas willcontribute to inter-Korean dialogue and eventualunification,&quot; an official U.S. statement said. &quot;Accordingly,we welcome this announcement, and in furtherance of theprinciple of universality will support U.N. admission of bothKoreas.&quot; Permanent members of the U.N. Security Council,which include the U.S., the Soviet Union and China, can vetomembership requests. Britain and France, also SecurityCouncil members, are expected to support both applications.   &quot;It will draw North Korea out of isolation a little bit,&quot;said a Western diplomat. Said another, &quot;It will suit a lot ofpeople to have the two going in.&quot;   Diplomats in Seoul said the key to North Korea's shift inposition was most likely the Chinese. A close ally of NorthKorea, Beijing may have indicated to the North Koreans inrecent talks that it didn't want to be forced into vetoingSouth Korea's application, which would embarrass China infront of the world. The South Korean government had earlierwon assurances from Moscow, North Korea's other major ally,that it wouldn't veto a membership application by the South.   Although U.N. membership, in itself, isn't likely to pushthe two Koreas closer to reunification, it does ease the wayfor them to talk and trade with each other. &quot;If we try in thecontext of the U.N. to cooperate with each other, then thatmeans something,&quot; said Lee Joung Bihn, South Korea'sassistant foreign minister for political affairs.   By reversing its one-Korea policy, however reluctantly,North Korea is making its first recognition of South Korea asa de facto government. The South doesn't officially recognizethe North's government, while the North has refused to evenrecognize the South's existence. &quot;We do hope it will leadNorth Korea to change its position on South Korea,&quot; said Mr.Lee.</TEXT></DOC>
