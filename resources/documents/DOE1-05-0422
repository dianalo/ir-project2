Therefore, it is important that the fuel clad ballooning inthe process of an accident should not significantly block the flow areaof fuel assemblies or critically impair their cooling. This paper discussesthe influence of fuel clad straining on the blockage in WWER type assembliesand is a further evolution of investigations in this direction.</TEXT></DOC>
