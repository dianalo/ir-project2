Share prices tumbled in early trading but recovered later, amidthe rumors that a Cabinet minister was about to quit Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher's government because of the alleged scandal.   The jittery market reaction and the speculation that Parkinsonwas involved reflected edginess about the government.   It already was shaken by last week's resignation of Chancellorof the Exchequer Nigel Lawson in a policy dispute with Mrs.Thatcher.   In the first hour of trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange100-share index fell 12.7 points, but share prices rallied afterParkinson denied involvement and a television network that wasconducting the investigation said its program was not yet ready.   At 11 a.m. (6 a.m. EDT), the 100-share index stood at 2,157.1,down 3 points, or 0.1 percent, from Wednesday's close.   Parkinson, in a statement issued through his lawyer, PeterCarter-Ruck, said there was ``no foundation whatsoever'' in therumors, adding he has not ``engaged in any insider dealing, nor inany share dealings.''   The statement said Parkinson transferred his funds tostockbrokers when he became a Cabinet minister and he has since``played no part whatsoever'' in any investments his brokers made.   ``The rumor that he might resign as minister of transport istotally without foundation,'' the statement said.   A spokeswoman at Mrs. Thatcher's Downing Street office said shehad no information on the insider trading rumors involvingParkinson.   ``We have no knowledge of this and we can't comment,'' she said.   The rumors began today after The Scotsman, a respected dailybased in Edinburgh, reported that Britain's Channel 4 televisionnetwork has investigated a insider-dealing group which allegedlyhas at least one senior government member among its clients.   In a statement, Channel 4 confirmed it is working on theinvestigation but said the program was ``as yet neither completenor scheduled.'' The network declined to elaborate.   The Scotsman said the program ``claims that the secretshare-buying ring has been carrying out transactions on behalf of anumber of clients, some of whom may not know the precise nature ofthe dealings, but who have all benefited from them.''   Insider trading is the illegal attempt to profit by buying andselling stock based on inside information about a company, such astakeover offers or profits prospects, which is not available to thepublic.   Mrs. Thatcher reappointed Parkinson to the Cabinet in 1987, fouryears after he resigned when news broke that his ex-secretary waspregnant by him. The secretary, Sara Keays, who now has hisdaughter, said that Parkinson had reneged on promises of marriage.He stayed with his wife.</TEXT></DOC>
