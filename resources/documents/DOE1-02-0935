These stresses may inducefracturing of the waste matrix, repository vault and nearfield host geology.This fracturing will enhance the advective flow and allow more-rapidtransfer of radionuclides from their encapsulation through the repositorybarriers and nearfield host rock. Geological loads may be applied eithergradually as in crustal folding or encroachment of ice sheets, or rapidlyas in the case of seismic movements. The analysis outlined in this reportis conducted with a view to including the effects of geological loadingin a probabilistic repository site assessment computer code such as SYVAC.</TEXT></DOC>
