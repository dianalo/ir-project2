According tothe correspondence relation, the intrinsic wave functions for the interactingboson model SU{sub 3} limit are constructed from its fermion counterpartand analytic expressions are given for the SU{sub 6}{contains}SU{sub3} isoscalar factors. The correlation between the D pair abundance inthe ground states and the interaction strength is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
