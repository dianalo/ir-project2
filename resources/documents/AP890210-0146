The meeting came after a U.S. report criticized theIsraeli crackdown.   The PLO has tried since mid-January to draft a resolutioncondemning the Israeli army's use of rubber and plastic bullets andtear gas but has been unable to formulate language that the UnitedStates will not veto.   About a week ago the PLO gave up and withdrew its resolutionafter U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said he would veto anylanguage that did not also call on the Palestinians to restraintheir protests.   More than 370 Palestinians have been killed in protests since theuprising began in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in December1987.   Fifteen Jews also have died in clashes.   Asked about the latest resolution, Riyad H. Mansour, the PLO'sdeputy permanent U.N. observer, said the language was still beingdrafted, but ``it condemns the Israeli policies and practices.''   ``We expect a resolution to be adopted that will allow theSecurity Council to really assume its responsibility to stop theIsraelis from the continuation of this onslaught against ourpeople,'' said Mansour.   ``There will be reference to human rights violations, especiallyas it is coming from the United States, the closest friend toIsrael.''   The Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Arab Leaguerenewed their efforts after the State Department criticized theIsraeli army in a human rights report for tactics that caused ``manyavoidable deaths and injuries.''</TEXT></DOC>
