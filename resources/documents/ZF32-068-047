 Old ways of living died out as new ones were born.andM;We too are at the mid-point of a revolution that's again transforming theworld.andP;  Yet we're so close to the present that we often don't realize howboth our work and home lives are being forever changed.andM;Scholars in the 21st century will look back and declare the period 1975-2000the Computer Revolution.andP;  Undreamed-of information retrieval and modificationpower are now within the hands of office and home users alike.andP;  Just as steeland steam defined the late 19th century, information and software will definethe last quarter of the 20th century.andM;And the connection with Unix?andP;  The one lingua franca operating system in thecomputer world, Unix bridges the gap from the most powerful supercomputer toall but the smallest PC.andP;  Unix, which appeared at the dawn of the computerage, will be going strong when we bid adieu to this century.andP;  Any skepticswho still need convincing should just examine some recent events.andM;Take, for example, the formation of the Advanced Computer Environment (ACE)initiative.andP;  This 21-member-strong consortium includes both PC and Unixheavyweights.andP;  Microsoft's Bill Gates, Compaq's Ron Canion, Santa CruzOperation's (SCO) Doug Michels, and others joined forces to establishstandards for the MIPS Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) CPUs.andP;  Theyachieved far more than this, however--these corporate giants also laid outplans for the future of SCO's Unix and Microsoft's OS/2.andM;Nonetheless, I honestly doubt that the ACE initiatives will directly produceanything lasting.andP;  The companies involved have too many conflicting interestsfor a smooth marriage.andP;  (In the short run, it will only slow down support forUnix).andP;  ACE offers the one thing that Unix and open systems proponents don'tneed:  another vision of Unix's future.andP;  Thanks, guys, but Open SoftwareFoundation vs.andP;  Unix International was already bad enough.andM;ACE:  A Good Idea at the Wrong Time?andM;In the long run, though, ACE bodes well for Unix users.andP;  As the years rollby, it will become more apparent that high-performance machines require ahigh-performance operating system: Unix.andP;  The importance of ACE isn't in whatit will do, it's that the clone and operating system giants, who don't havemuch invested in Unix, are finally playing in the open systems game.andM;The other thing that caught my attention were two product announcements.andO;First, SCO has finally brought out their eagerly awaited Open Desktop 1.1.andM;Open Desktop 1.0 was a fine product, but it had its shortcomings.andP;  It wasslow, and installing Desktop 1.0 was often an adventure.andM;The new version is leaner, cleaner and meaner.andP;  Now running on top of SCO'sUnix System V/386 release 3.2 version 2.0, Open Desktop has the muscles andspeed of a panther.andP;  In addition, installing the beast has never been easier.andM;Once Open Desktop is up and running, it's a real pleasure to use.andP;  With itsintegrated GUI based on IXI's X.desktop 2.0, the desktop manager runs assmooth as silk.andP;  It makes a good first Unix for any user.andP;  For that matter,Open Desktop could serve well as anyone's first operating system, coveringUnix's sometimes cryptic commands with a warm, user-friendly blanket.andP;  Thereare many other significant improvements, but it comes down to a vastlyimproved combination of operating system, GUI, and database manager.andM;Open Desktop 1.1 isn't a radical change from its forebears.andP;  The program isan evolutionary step forward and an important one.andP;  With this version, userswho don't know the first thing about &quot;Is&quot; or &quot;ps&quot; can sit at their computersand get work done.andP;  Open Desktop is not as friendly as a Mac, of course, butit's more congenial than Windows 3.0 or OS/2 Presentation Manager.andP;  Equallyimportant, it's more powerful than either of its better-known GUIcompetitors.andM;Trying to view today with the eyes of tomorrow is not easy.andP;  When I gaze atOpen Desktop 1.1, I see the first Unix that is so truly friendly and easy touse that even the most Unix-phobic office will consider trying it out.andM;Open OfficesandM;Open Desktop isn't the only recent introduction that may bring Unix to moredesks.andP;  Dell has been pushing Unix for more than a year now, and its latesUnix stations, like the Dell 433E 33MHz 486, bring true workstation power tothe office.andP;  Dell's newest systems come with the best version of Unix SystemV release 4 (SVR4) that I've seen to date.andP;  SVR4 was meant to bring togetherthe best ideas from earlier Unix systems, and thus took the best fromBerkeley Unix, System V release 3.2, SunOS, and Xenix.andP;  It was a noble idea,and many would agree that SVR4 has been a success.andM;Sadly, users with 386 or 486 systems have not been able to use SVR4'spotential to its fullest.andP;  Earlier versions of SVR4 for Intel architectureswere, shall I say, a little unpolished.andP;  These versions of SVR4 were fine, ifyou knew what you were doing.andP;  The rule was that these Unixes were unsuitablefor beginners or offices without a Unix wizard.andM;Dell changed that rule.andP;  Its Unix stations combine raw power with a complete,accessible SVR4 Unix.andP;  While not the equal of a true workstation with amegapixel display and built-in Ethernet capacity, the 433E can take on thebiggest office jobs.andM;In one way, there's nothing new here.andP;  You could always take a good Unix,like the one by Interactive or SCO, and put it on a hot platform and expectkick-rump action.andP;  Bundling Unix and a platform isn't news, either.andO;Minicomputer vendors have been doing this for years.andP;  What is interesting isthat a major clone vendor is packaging this complete workstation solution.andO;You don't have to fiddle with tunable parameters or deal with minicomputerarcana--Dell gives you a workstation in a box.andM;This is no small matter.andP;  If you're an office computer manager interested inUnix, the last thing you want is to fight your way to find the bestcombination of operating system and equipment.andP;  Dell offers a one-stopdirect-market answer for a decent price.andP;  It's a hard bargain to resist.andM;Dell's System 433E, along with the growing number of SPARCstation clones,marks what I think will someday be seen as a fundamental change in themarketplace.andP;  Complete Unix platforms are now being offered in greaternumbers and at lower prices than ever before.andM;Ultimately, I think that the changes we've seen in the last few months willmake Unix a more important player in the overall operating system field.andO;Unix will never replace MS-DOS, but it is going to gain a more significantrole in PC-based workstations and file servers.andP;  No matter who wins theoperating systems wars, Unix will be with us in the 21st century.andM;In regard to present-day issues, these events clearly show Unix becomingeasier for offices to adopt.andP;  Long-term planners will be assured of Unix'sfuture.andP;  Managers thinking of trying Unix will be encouraged, knowing thatUnix systems are easier to use than ever before.andP;  No matter which view youtake, the future of Unix looks unbeatable.andP;  The revolution continues, andUnix's place in it is more secure than ever.andM;Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols is a freelance writer.andP;  He can be reached on MCIMail as sjvn..andO;</TEXT></DOC>
