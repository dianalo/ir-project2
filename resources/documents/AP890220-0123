The Immigration and Naturalization Service staff in southernTexas will be increased by 500 to patrol the border and speed up theweeding out of ``frivolous'' asylum claims, INS Commissioner AlanNelson announced.   More jails will be built to hold people who are turned downpending their appeal or deportation, he said.   ``We intend to send a strong signal to those people who have themistaken idea that by merely filing a frivolous asylum claim, theymay stay in the United States,'' Nelson said. ``This willfulmanipulation of America's generosity must stop.''   A group called the Brownsville Ad Hoc Refugee Committeecriticized the new INS policy as a ``mean-spirited attempt to deterpolitical refugees from applying for political asylum.''   The policy will be phased in over the next several weeks. Nelsonsaid the INS hopes eventually to process most asylum applications inthe region in a day or two. Currently, asylum decisions can takemonths.   ``We hope to have same-day service,'' said INS spokeswomanVirginia Kice.   The changes came the same day the INS was allowed to reinstate apolicy restricting people seeking asylum from leaving southern Texaswhile they await decisions.   Before Dec. 16, the INS allowed Central American asylum seekersto check in at its south Texas district, then travel anywhere in theUnited States while their cases were reviewed. But after that date,the agency made them stay in the Brownsville area during the review,forcing them to live in tents and trying the patience of residentsand relief agencies.   Responding to a lawsuit filed by attorneys representing asylumseekers, U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela issued a temporary orderJan. 9 requiring the INS to once more allow the Central Americans totravel. He ruled Friday that the INS could return to the policy ofrestricting their movement.   Tens of thousands of Central Americans are expected to cross theRio Grande into southern Texas this year, according to the INS,which says political asylum requests from Central Americans haverisen almost sevenfold over the past four years. More than 50,000sought asylum in fiscal year 1988, compared with 7,063 in 1985.   According to INS records, 3,136 people applied for asylum betweenWednesday and Sunday at the agency's Port Isabel Processing Center,a rural detention center 15 miles northeast of Brownsville, the mainentry point for asylum-seekers from war-torn and poverty-strickenCentral America.   But INS officials maintain that most of the Central Americans arehere for economic reasons and do not qualify for asylum frompersecution.   Robert Rubin, lead counsel in the lawsuit that led to therestraining order, said INS detention ``should be the exception andnot the rule for asylum seekers.'' He said the United States shouldshow a ``humanitarian spirit.''   Roughly half of the Central Americans seeking asylum are fromNicaragua, Nelson said.   ``In a real sense,'' said Rubin, in San Francisco, ``the INS hasbecome a prisoner of its own policy. And that policy as recently as1987 and 1988 was to encourage Nicaraguans to come to the UnitedStates because they would be granted asylum.   ``Now, finally, the United States appears to be overwhelmed bythe numbers and it is no longer politically expedient'' to acceptthe Nicaraguans.   Under the new policy, those denied asylum can either returnimmediately to their home countries or be given a hearing before animmigration judge where they may renew their applications for asylum.   Nelson said he did not know how long it might take for a personto get that hearing before a judge.   ``I think we're going to see detention in years,'' saidimmigration lawyer Linda Yanez.   While they await deportation, single adults will be detained atprison-like INS detention centers; family groups may be allowed tostay in less-restrictive facilities that will be set up, Nelson said.   Nelson said if more detention space were needed, the agency coulderect tents to house up to 5,000 people within 10 days.   Brownsville Mayor Ygnacio Garza welcomed the plan. ``From thestandpoint of the city, I think it will be good in terms of takingpeople and providing for them in a humanitarian way,'' Garza said.   Although hundreds of Hondurans, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans andGuatemalans have camped outside the Port Isabel Processing Center intemperatures dropping into the 40s waiting to apply for asylum, manyhave been grateful for their reception. Local residents haveprovided food and blankets.   ``We expected people at the border aiming rifles at us, but theAmerican people have been very kind, very generous, and weappreciate it,'' said Honduran Marcio Nunez as he ate a meal of riceand beans provided by members of a Port Isabel church.   ``In Honduras, we have a very bad concept of the United Statesbecause of all the Mexican movies showing mean agents,'' Nunezadded, ``but you have been very generous.''</TEXT></DOC>
