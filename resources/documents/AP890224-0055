ROWE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   A blast of arctic air whisked through parts of the South,threatening crops, closing schools and creating treacherous travelconditions on roadways where scores of accidents occurred. Twoweather-related deaths were reported.   Snow fell in some areas where people hadn't seen it for years, asthe gelid conditions descended as far south as Florida today. A34-degree reading at Orlando was lower than the reading at Minot,N.D., which had a temperature of 37 degrees.   Elsewhere in the South, flood-stricken Kentucky was declared amajor disaster area by President Bush today, making federal aidavailable to affected people and local governments. The region washit by heavy rains and flooding beginning on Feb. 13.   And in Tennessee, many residents forced from their houses by therain-swollen Obion River contended with freezing temperatures andicy backwater as they await a chance to start cleaning up the messleft by the flooding.   ``If it gets much colder, I'll be able to pick the backwater upin my truck and haul it away,'' said Billy Elam, a resident of thesmall town of Obion.   Brisk northwest winds accompanied the cold temperatures,producing wind chill readings in the single digits in Georgia thismorning.   A man who would have celebrated his 85th birthday today was founddead of hypothermia in Montgomery, Ala., on Thursday, policespokesman Wyatt Gantt said. Because the heaters in the man's housewere off, his death was ruled weather-related, Gantt said.   In Georgia, a 72-year-old man died Thursday when his pickup truckfell off an icy bridge on the U.S. 29 bypass near Athens and plungedinto the North Oconee River, police said.   Georgia's agriculture commissioner, Tommy Irvin, said freezingweather threatened wheat, peach and onion crops.   ``I think we're in for some hard times,'' said Rick Hartley,Toombs County extension service director.   In Alabama, peach growers also braced for the worst.   ``Probably the majority of them right now feel like with as lowas it's predicted to go, there's not a whole lot they can do,'' saidTommy Brown, extension agent coordinator for Chilton County, wheremost of Alabama's peach crop is grown.   Brown said some peach growers were planning to burn coal or tiresto ward off the effects of the bitter cold.   An 88-year-old record was set in Mobile early today when thetemperature dropped to 24. The previous record for this date was 28degrees set in 1901.   In Georgia, snow accumulations ranged up to 7 inches, andflurries were seen as far south as Valdosta, near the Florida border.   Nancy Robinson, a police desk clerk in Valdosta, said the lastsnowfall police could recall in the area was six years ago.   ``The kids were very excited because they're not used to this,''she said.   The University of Georgia at Athens was closed today as wereschool systems through the northern half of the state.   Snow began falling in Savannah late Thursday, the first seen inthree years, police said. It forced closing of the Talmadge MemorialBridge over the Savannah River to South Carolina and caused a numberof accidents.   Alabama emergency management officials said several majorroadways were closed Thursday because of slick conditions, includingsections of Interstate 59 in northeast Alabama and Interstate 20east of Birmingham. All roads had reopened by the afternoon.   The combination of increasing snowfall and high winds madedriving very hazardous throughout North Carolina.   ``It's bad,'' said Officer Dennis Anders of the Alleghany CountySheriff's Department. ``All the roads are covered, we've got ice,and people are wrecking right and left.''   A pair of firefighters and their two children were seriouslyinjured Thursday evening while trying to help two other motoriststrapped in an overturned car off Interstate 240.   A tractor-trailer jackknifed and struck two parked pickupscarrying a boy and girl, and the two firefighters who were standingalong the road.   Among the other accidents were a 15-car pileup in Asheville onThursday morning. And in Winston-Salem, at least 100 accidents werereported within the city limits, authorities said.</TEXT></DOC>
