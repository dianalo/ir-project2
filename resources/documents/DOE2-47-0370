For the first 60 years, until World War II,fairly standard international design practices were followed. Over therecent years, the evolution of design is marked by the possibilitiesopened up by dramatic improvements in rock blasting, earth movement,and engineering geology. Underground powerhouse, rock fill dams, arecharacteristic features. Supreme achievement is the unlined pressureshaft for up to 1000 m of head. Grid integration optimizes the utilizationof natural complementarities in runoff and storage.</TEXT></DOC>
