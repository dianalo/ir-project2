Some freed others. Some could rescue only themselves.   Passengers spoke of the pilot's warnings before Wednesday'sdeadly crash, but they mostly remembered the impact and escaping thefractured fuselage.   More than half of the 293 people on board the flight survived thecrash, some walking away with only bruises. The three-member cockpitcrew survived, too.   The pilot warned passengers about 20 minutes before the crashthat ``it would likely be a rough landing,'' several survivorsrecalled.   Among the passengers was another pilot, who put a pillow over hishead as the plane crashed and cartwheeled three times just off anunused runway at Sioux Gateway Airport.   ``We rolled upside down, and inside out and every which way. Theplane broke into three pieces, and bodies all over the place,hanging upside down,'' said Charlie Martz, of Castle Rock, Colo.   ``I unfastened my belt and dropped a little ways. ... Finally Isaw what I thought was an open window, but there were flames. Isaid, `To hell with it, I'm going for it' and I went through theflames. I can't believe it, there were people with feet missing andarms missing, it's the goddamndest thing I've ever seen in my life.''   In Chicago, 33 tired and somber survivors completed their journeyearly this morning on a chartered United Airlines flight.   Several wore neck braces, one had a bandaged eye and at least twopeople still wore dirt- or blood-stained clothing. Police escortedthem through O'Hare Airport, keeping reporters away.   Debbie Belliveau, 40, of Michigan City, Ind., spoke to reporters,though, saying the fire that erupted after the crash ``scared usall. Because the fire was really obvious. I mean there was smokeeverywhere.''   Mrs. Belliveau said the professionalism of the flight attendantsand the pilot's calm voice convinced her that the plane would bebrought in safely.   ``We thought we were going to make it and when he said `brace,brace, brace' for the second time we really thought we were going tomake it.''   In Sioux City, Danny Surge of Chicago said when it was apparentthe plane was in trouble passenger Ron Rhode of Marysville, Ohio,went over to sit with 8-year-old Ben Radtke of Prairie View, Ill.,who was traveling alone.   The plane ``hit and bounced, then flipped and spun around so weended up upside down. I let go and asked Dan for the kid'' andshoved him out, Rhode said.   Ben was shaking but thankful to be alive.   ``I thought I was going to die,'' he said, clutching a UnitedAirlines button and a pair of plastic pilot's wings.   As the plane filled with smoke shortly after the crash, CliffMarshall of Columbus, Ohio, saw a way out.   ``God opened a hole in the basement, and I pushed a little girlout and grabbed another and kept pulling them out until they didn'tcome no more,'' he said.   David Landsberger, 40, of Caldwell, N.J., said after the planestopped sliding, ``we let ourselves down and started walking towardsthis large open area at the back of the plane.   ``We just all walked out into a cornfield. I was a little dazed.I do know that I probably stepped on some people or something as wewere walking out, but I knew if we stopped we'd all get bottled up.''   Bruce Benham, 37, a Littleton, Colo., restaurateur, said theevacuation was orderly: ``There was not a lot of panic. Only when Igot into the cornfield did I look back and see other parts of theplane burning.''   Later, Landsberger was unsure of his plans.   ``I'd really like to go have a beer and go to bed,'' he said. ``Idon't know what I'm going to do. But I'm not going to walk back toNew Jersey. I'll probably fly.''</TEXT></DOC>
