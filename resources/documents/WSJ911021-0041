Also investigated were allegations that a Nynex executivehad thrown lewd parties in Florida that were attended byNynex employees and suppliers of the Nynex phone companies --an alleged conflict of interest that led New York TelephoneCo. and New England Telephone Co. to pay higher prices forgoods and services purchased from Nynex's MaterielEnterprises Co.</LP><TEXT>   However, the investigation by a Special Review Committeeappointed by the company absolved Nynex of wrongdoing andconcluded that pending derivative lawsuits filed by fourshareholders &quot;should be dismissed and no remedial action&quot; isrequired beyond what the company has already done to changethe way its phone companies procure supplies, includingnetwork equipment. The committee comprises nine outsidedirectors of Nynex and legal counsel from Sullivan andamp;Cromwell.   Nynex said the committee's report led one of thoseplaintiffs, Charles Maurer, on Thursday to ask a DelawareChancery Court to dismiss his complaint against Nynex,certain top officers, including current Chairman William C.Ferguson, and certain directors. &quot;The board has takenremedial steps as a result of Mr. Maurer's demands and we seeno reason to proceed with our claims,&quot; said Lawrence Kolker,Mr. Maurer's attorney.   In addition, a Nynex spokeswoman said the company wasinformed Thursday that the two other pending shareholderactions in Delaware &quot;would join the Maurer motion to dismissor file a similar motion.&quot; The other lawsuit pending againstNynex in New York Supreme Court was dismissed by Judge DianeLebedeff on Oct. 9.   The Special Review Committee's investigation concludedearlier this year and its report was printed in May. Thereport had been kept private under a protective order fromthe Delaware Chancery Court and the New York Public ServiceCommission, which is still conducting its own investigationinto Nynex's business practices and corporate structure.However, the report became public Thursday, when Mr. Maurermoved to dismiss his case and cited the report as the basisfor his motion, Nynex said.   &quot;The {committee's} report details quite a bit ofwrongdoing {but} . . . we are satisfied that problems arebeing addressed&quot; by the company, said Robert I. Harwood, anattorney for one of the plaintiffs, Lester Associates, a NewJersey-based partnership.   Nynex took several actions since the allegations surfacedin early 1990 to restructure the way in which it supplies itsphone companies. Nynex transferred its ownership of Meco toits phone companies, making Meco subject to regulatoryoversight. Nynex also made the division of its regulated andnon-regulated businesses more distinct, creating aTelecommunications Group to contain its phone companies and aWorldwide Services Group, which comprises its unregulatedbusinesses. The executive who hosted the so-called &quot;perverts'conventions&quot; in Florida was dismissed in 1988, one employeefired and another seven workers were disciplined, Nynex said.   In addition, Nynex formed an Office of Ethics and BusinessConduct, which supervises and advises employees on thecompany's &quot;code of business conduct&quot; and investigatesemployee complaints about unethical behavior within thecompany.</TEXT></DOC>
