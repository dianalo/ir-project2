With both conventions being held in BellSouth market areas, the regional Bell holding company will show off its latest technology in Atlanta and in New Orleans in an effort to plant the idea that phone lines could deliver a lot more if federal regulations were eased.    &quot;We want to show what we can do as a company and what could be brought to the marketplace,&quot; says Mickey McGuire, who heads BellSouth's lobby office in Washington, D.C. John Clendenin, BellSouth's chairman, says the conventions will enable the company to give delegates and reporters a look at what technology can do &quot;if it is brought to the marketplace in a fairly unfettered fashion.&quot;    As part of the effort, Atlanta-based BellSouth will woo lawmakers and reporters with high-technology exhibits, expanded opportunities for TV coverage and up-to-the-minute convention schedules.    BellSouth isn't alone in using the convention process to try to persuade lawmakers to lift restrictions on the seven regional telephone companies. William L. Weiss, chairman of Chicago-based Ameritech, recently attacked the ban on manufacturing by the Baby Bells before the Republican platform committee.    Unlike the Ameritech plea for lifting restrictions, the message from BellSouth in Atlanta and New Orleans will be more subtle. While technicians for the major news organizations will better understand and appreciate the complexities of the arrangements, reporters likely will judge BellSouth on the phone service's reliability.    So the company's Southern Bell unit in Atlanta and its South Central Bell unit in New Orleans have been installing hundreds of miles of fiber optic cable; preparing links from inside the convention centers to satellite relay trucks that will be parked outside; installing public phones with special jacks to accommodate data transmission on laptop computers; and putting in new cells to handle the hundreds of cellular phones that many news organizations plan to bring.    Southern Bell has been furiously installing about 3,600 lines at the World Congress Center in Atlanta for the Democratic convention starting today. Paul Harman, the unit's general marketing manager for the Democratic convention, says, &quot;One of the things we've done here is a lot of 'what-if' planning -- like what if a candidate wants to move from one hotel to another overnight.&quot;    Southern Bell also prepared a high-tech exhibit at the center. Among other things, the company plans to demonstrate the latest voice messaging systems and gateways, which allow a personal computer to retrieve information from a wide range of data services.    If all goes according to plan, delegates and reporters in Atlanta will get their first look at high-definition TV on sets placed around the convention site. Also for the first time, many smaller cities will get TV coverage of both conventions by hometown reporters as a result of a jump in satellite relay trucks from a handful at the 1984 conventions to as many as 60 now.    In New Orleans, South Central Bell will mix low tech and high tech at its message center. The unit plans to hand-deliver messages to delegates and alternates on little pink slips. But it also will use the center to demonstrate its Big Call audiotex service, which will provide an up-to-the-minute schedule of convention activities.    &quot;The subtle message there,&quot; says BellSouth's Mr. Clendenin, &quot;is that this country has to provide the opportunity to permit this kind of technology to spread.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
