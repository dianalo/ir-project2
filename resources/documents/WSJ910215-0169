There's Toyota of Japan. There's Ford ofDetroit. And now, there's Matchbox Toys of Moonachie, N.J.   Matchbox? The company that makes those cute little toycars? That's right. But the David vs. Goliath appearance ofthis fight isn't deterring GM, which is doing battle withdozens of other toy and model car makers as well. The issueis -- guess what -- money.</LP><TEXT>   GM (revenues: nearly $125 billion) is demanding royaltiesfrom Matchbox (revenues: about $200 million) and the othercompanies that make and sell the small-scale replicas of itsvehicles. After all, GM argues, everyone else, fromprofessional sports teams to sneaker companies, licensestrademarks, so why shouldn't a car maker? &quot;This is aprofitable business that we can benefit from,&quot; says GM'strademark counsel, Kenneth D. Enborg.   Mr. Enborg collected toy cars himself as a boy, so hecertainly doesn't want to be known as a Scrooge -- or, as heputs it in more appropriate lawyer terms, &quot;To destroy thehobby is antithetical to what we want to do.&quot;   Hobbyists and collectors, not to mention the model-carmakers themselves, are furious. &quot;I've never seen the industrythis riled,&quot; says Dennis Doty, editor of Model Car Journal.&quot;Toy and model car enthusiasts are usually pretty easygoing.&quot;They're writing letters and hinting darkly of boycotts.   For years, the enthusiasts note, auto makers have let thecompanies replicate their models without charge because theyfigured Matchbox-type cars and model kits were freepublicity. In most instances, the auto makers only wantedsamples of the toy cars to make sure they were closereproductions of the originals. Changing that system now, theenthusiasts argue, is a greedy move that will push up prices.   &quot;It is no wonder that Americans are buying more of theirautomobiles from the Europeans, the Japanese and theKoreans,&quot; model-car collector Richard Allen Hiteshaw ofBaltimore wrote to GM Chairman Robert C. Stempel. &quot;It is justanother reflection of quarterly bottom-line psychologydriving your company to ruin.&quot;   Christian Pamp of Frankfurt, Germany, who collects bothreal and model cars, did more than write a letter. He was soangry that last June he canceled his order for a real PontiacGrand Prix, to be shipped to him from the U.S., and bought aFord Thunderbird instead. &quot;The royalties literally kept mefrom buying a GM car,&quot; says Mr. Pamp, whose collectionincludes about 5,000 model cars and 25 real ones.   Mr. Pamp didn't mind buying the Thunderbird because Fordisn't demanding royalties from the toy-car companies. &quot;Wevalue the interest and enthusiasm generated by the cars,&quot;says a Ford spokesman. Nor are the Japanese or European automakers charging royalties, with the exception of Porsche AG.Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep division, like GM, wants royalties, andboth companies started seeking them on a limited basis as farback as 1986. GM, which has been the most aggressive, broughtthe issue to a boil last spring, somewhat by accident.   That's when 2,000 model cars being shipped from Germany toa U.S. distributor were detained by Customs in Philadelphia.GM had instructed Customs to detain any items that violatedits trademark, but at the time it was really concerned aboutan influx of counterfeit spare parts for real cars. &quot;I don'tknow what GM's motive is,&quot; says Michael Bass, president ofStevens International of Magnolia, N.J., the company that wasto receive the cars, which included replicas of Cadillacs,Buicks and Pontiacs. &quot;But it's ironic that they decided tocharge royalties at a time their sales are down.&quot;   The shipment of cars finally was released in August, saysMr. Bass, when the German toy-car maker that shipped thembegan negotiating a licensing agreement with GM.   After the incident, word spread quickly that GM wasserious about royalties. AutoWeek magazine, an automotivetrade journal, devoted its cover story to GM's move and itseffect on the companies that make and sell toy cars,including such well-known names as Matchbox, Mattel Toys ofEl Segundo, Calif., and Revell/Monogram of Des Plaines, Ill.The toys come fully assembled or in do-it-yourself kits thatrange from $1 plastic models to sophisticated steel and metalmodels that can cost as much as $1,000. Americans spent about$260 million on toy and model cars in 1989, says the ToyManufacturers of America, a trade group.   While the toy makers didn't like the idea of royaltypayments, they quickly concluded that they didn't have muchlegal basis for opposing them. At least 75 of them will payroyalties to GM this year, says the auto maker, up from only47 in 1990. Five toy makers pay Jeep royalties to Chrysler.   Neither the auto makers nor the toy companies willdisclose the exact amount of the royalties. GM says thepayments are six to eight cents per car, but some toy andmodel-car makers say that's enough to force price increases.&quot;The royalties do nothing but make it even more difficult forkids to buy the cars,&quot; complains a spokesman forRevell/Monogram, which begins paying royalties to GM thisyear. &quot;Their fun is being threatened by higher prices.&quot;   Sinclair's Auto Miniatures Inc., a distributor of modelcars based in Erie, Pa., says prices of its GM replicas roseto $65 in September from $59.95. Revell/Monogram has raisedprices 5% to 6% on all its models, although the companyacknowledges that the rising price of plastic is anotherfactor. &quot;GM and Chrysler really look like bullies in thissituation,&quot; says Mr. Doty of Model Car Journal. &quot;It's like alight went on and they said, `Hey, we can make money offthis.'&quot;   Not all model-car makers are angry. &quot;Charging royalties isan ordinary business practice,&quot; says James Walsh, vicepresident of licensing at Ertl Co. in Dyersville, Iowa, amodel-car manufacturer that will begin paying royalties to GMthis year. &quot;It surprises me that people think it's notjustified.&quot;   GM and Chrysler agree. They say they don't deserve theblame for higher prices. They accuse some toy makers of usingthe royalties as an excuse for price increases that weregoing to occur anyway. &quot;As we calculate it, our royalties per{model car} kit add up to only a few pennies,&quot; says GM's Mr.Enborg. &quot;If the companies are going to pass on a few penniesto the consumer, that's their decision.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
