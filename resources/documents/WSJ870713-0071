HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GFC FSBFTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   Gibraltar Financial Corp., citing concerns about its falling stock price and share dilution, said it will ask federal thrift regulators to relax conditions imposed in their approval of Gibraltar's proposed $116 million acquisition of a Florida thrift.    Gibraltar, a Beverly Hills, Calif.-based thrift holding company, said it will ask the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to allow it to pay for First Savings Bank of Florida, based in Tarpon Springs, entirely in cash, rather than paying 30% in Gibraltar stock, as required by the Bank Board.    Gibraltar disclosed yesterday that when the Bank Board approved the acquisition on June 30, it required that Gibraltar pay no more than 70% of the price in cash. In its application for approval of the merger, and in agreements approved by shareholders of both companies, Gibraltar said it would pay as much as 100% in cash.    Herbert J. Young, chairman of Gibraltar, said in an interview yesterday that paying 30% of the purchase price in stock would result in a more than 20% dilution of the interests of current Gibraltar shareholders. He noted that Gibraltar's stock price had plunged about 26% -- to $8.875 a share on Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading from $12 a share when the acquisition was negotiated last October.    Thrift stocks generally have dropped in the past six months, partly because of fears of rising interest rates.    The falling stock price would require issuing a greater number of shares than originally had been expected, Mr. Young said. &quot;Over 20% is too much dilution,&quot; he added. He said that he believes the Bank Board imposed the limitation on a cash payment so that the merged company would have a larger amount of capital.    At current market prices, Gibraltar would have to issue about four million new shares to pay 30% of the cost of First Savings Bank, increasing Gibraltar's shares outstanding to about 24.5 million from 20.5 million currently.    Mr. Young said Gibraltar learned of the Bank Board's restriction on the amount of cash it could pay on July 1, after Gibraltar had disclosed that the Bank Board approved the acquisition. He said Gibraltar didn't make an additional public disclosure about the Bank Board's restriction because it was advised by its lawyers that no disclosure was needed until Gibraltar decided what action it would take. Gibraltar's chief outside counsel declined to comment.    Mr. Young said Gibraltar tried unsuccessfully last week to persuade officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, which supervises Gibraltar, to allow Gibraltar to pay all cash for First Savings Bank without asking the Bank Board in Washington to change its ruling.    Mr. Young said Gibraltar's management decided on Friday to seek a rehearing before the Bank Board in Washington. He said Gibraltar's board met Saturday to approve the decision to seek the rehearing. Mr. Young added that Gibraltar wanted to announce the rehearing move before the opening of stock-market trading today in a bid to halt the decline in Gibraltar's stock price, which he said was caused by fears of the dilution that would result from the First Savings Bank acquisition under the terms imposed by the Bank Board. Bank Board actions are publicly available, but often aren't widely disclosed.    Yesterday, Bank Board officials in Washington couldn't be reached for comment.    The First Savings Bank acquisition is also unusual because it will be made through a Gibraltar thrift unit in Washington state, rather than through Gibraltar's main unit in California.    The reason is that Washington and Florida have reciprocal interstate banking laws, while California and Florida don't have such laws. Other California thrift companies have moved into Florida by acquiring troubled thrifts. </TEXT></DOC>
