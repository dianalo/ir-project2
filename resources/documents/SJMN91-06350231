Hoteliers who thought they wererecession- or war-proof have been rudely awakened by sobering statistics.;  In New York, for example, citywide occupancy rates have dropped to 57 percent,15 points below last year's rates. The law of supply and demand is firmly inthe traveler's favor.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TOURIST-HUNGRY HOTELS OFFER DISCOUNTS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Investigative journalist Peter S. Greenberg writes a syndicated consumercolumn.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The combined impact of a bad economy, overbuilding and a sharp downturn intravel worldwide has not only created a hotel room glut, but it also hasforced hotels to realize the economic reality of their predicament.Consequently, many are radically lowering their rates and adjusting the pricesof other hotel services.;   This has happened worldwide, from New York and LosAngeles to Bangkok and London. Even the Soviet Union, traditionally hard upfor hard currency and very expensive, is offering big deals on tours andaccommodations.;   Perhaps more surprising, some of the very expensive upscalehotels, which have never before reduced their rates, have begun offeringdiscounts. In San Francisco, the Mandarin Oriental offers a package throughJan. 5, 1992, for $160 a night, a substantial discount over its regular rates.And through March 31, the Four Seasons Hotel in Toronto is offering its roomsfor (U.S.) $130 per night.;   Even the Savoy hotel group in London is offeringdiscounts. Its Lancaster Hotel in Paris guarantees its rate through Dec. 31 of$275 per room -- a 33 percent discount from last year. In London, the Savoyoffers a special seven-night package that involves the Savoy, Claridge's, theBerkeley, the Lygon Arms (or the Lancaster in Paris). Guests who book forseven days can arrange to stay at any of the hotels or any combination.;  Also, check out Rank hotels in Great Britain. This hotel group announced a&quot;pound for dollar&quot; parity program (which other hotels are starting to copy). Aroom that cost 118 British pounds now costs $118. With the British poundcurrently at about $1.75, that is a tremendous discount.;   In Hawaii, thediscounting has also been substantial. And while most of the deals aren'tadvertised (Hawaiian hoteliers are somewhat reluctant to acknowledge theiroccupancy problem) they are there. Call the hotels directly and negotiate.Don't be surprised if the hotels don't discount over the Christmas holidayperiod.;   The Intercontinental hotel chain is offering winter savings of upto 56 percent. It is also offering packages with even lower prices. The rates,offered from mid-December to mid-January, start as low as $99 per room.;  Included in the packages -- and available at Intercontinental hotels inAmsterdam, Athens, Brussels, London, Madrid, Paris and Rome -- are a fullAmerican breakfast for two, daily newspaper, all taxes and service charges.;  In the United States, Hyatt is cutting room prices at many of its hotels(especially prices of rooms on concierge or executive floors).;   In New York,Helmsley Hotels has announced discounted rooms (rates as low as $114 per roomthrough Jan. 6).;   One of the best holiday deals is offered by MGM Grand Airin conjunction with Renaissance cruises. How about this: a first-class flightto New York from Los Angeles and a seven-night Virgin and Leeward islandscruise at just $1,990 per person.;   In Monterey, the Spindrift Inn, MontereyBay Inn and Victorian Inn have all dropped their rates. through Jan. 30, theSpindrift will charge $89 per night. The Monterey Bay will reduce its rates to$69 per night and Victorian Inn rooms will go for the unheard of rate of $49per night. (One caution: The deal doesn't include Saturday nights).;   And inSan Francisco, the new 140-room Hotel Triton, which opened Nov. 1, already hasa great offer. Through April 1, travelers who stay two nights pay the rate forone night; if they stay three nights, they pay for two, and five nights, theypay for three. The rate: $125 a night.;   Last but not least, try a wintertrip to the Soviet Union. Soviet tourism officials are offering the lowestprices since the 1970s to stimulate travel.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Peter S.
