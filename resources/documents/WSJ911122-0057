The law, which hadn't resulted in any purchases yet, hadcome in for criticism because the Defense Department hadn'trequested the metal and in fact had said it didn't need it.The law had been the subject of a front-page article in TheWall Street Journal in June.</LP><TEXT>   House-Senate conferees agreed to repeal the law as part ofthe defense appropriations bill. That bill has been passed inthe House and is awaiting approval by the Senate.   Sens. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) and James Sasser (D.,Tenn.) had pushed for the adoption of the purchase provisionlast year. Both senators represent states that are home tocontractors that would have benefited from the uraniumpurchase. Congressional staff members say Sen. Daniel Inouye,(D., Hawaii), chairman of the defense appropriationssubcommittee, pushed for the repeal.   Nuclear Metals Inc., which is based in Concord, Mass., andhas a large depleted-uranium facility in South Carolina,would have been a major supplier of the metal under theprogram. Nuclear Metals said that because of decliningdefense budgets it plans to dismiss more than 100 workers, orabout 20% of its work force, over the next two months.Although Nuclear Metals hadn't sold any depleted uranium tothe government under the procurement plan, it had expandedits work force in anticipation of the additional business,said Wilson Tuffin, president.   The company said it nonetheless expects to be profitablefor all of fiscal 1992, ending next Sept. 30, because itsorder backlog is strong. Nuclear Metals said that its backlogas of Sept. 30 was $10.4 million, compared with $14.8 millionthe year before, but that the backlog has since risen to $33million as a result of orders for depleted-uranium tankammunition. Mr. Tuffin said this represents Nuclear Metals'&quot;highest backlog for quite some time.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
