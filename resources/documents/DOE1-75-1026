Even though a scale itself is not a fractal, its boundary (i.e.,the surface of the pore space) can be a fractal, which has been confirmedby recent experimental studies. Various techniques for determining thefractal dimensionality of pore-space surfaces are examined. Results arepresented for various materials, including graphite, coal, and porousaluminum. 12 references.</TEXT></DOC>
