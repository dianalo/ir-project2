The IMF loan, to be disbursed by installment until Feb. 28,1990, gives officials the opportunity to cut off funds if Brazil'seconomy has not performed as promised.   In the past, the IMF has required borrowers to lower theirspending, especially on subsidies, in return for its help. Brazilreportedly has promised to cut government spending by 22 percent.   The fund's spokesman, who insisted on anonymity, did not say howsoon its loan would have to be repaid. But Brazil will have 20years, including an eight-year grace period during which onlyinterest will be due, to pay back the $5.2 billion it borrowed fromthe banks.   The new loans amount to less than the interest payments onBrazil's current debt of $121 billion, the largest in the ThirdWorld. Last year the government suspended interest payments on itsbank loans, but began repayment again this year.   Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega said in July that thesuspension has not formally been revoked, but he said that might bedone when the country's 700 creditor banks joined the newagreement. Last week he announced in New York that 95 percent ofthe total had been committed.   In addition to its mounting debts, the government of PresidentJose Sarney has been struggling with inflation, which reached arecord 24.04 percent in July. One report has suggested Brazil'sinflation rate will reach 927 percent for the year, well above the600 percent level reportedly set in the government's agreementswith both the fund and banks.   On July 30, Brazil agreed in Paris with 13 creditor governments,including the United States, to delay repayment of $5 billion ofits $l5 billion debt to them. The United States has the largestblock of votes in the IMF.   The rescheduled debts, which fall due between Jan. 1, 1987 andMarch 31, 1990 were delayed for 10 years, with a five-year graceperiod.   ``Brazil will pay neither a cent of interest nor principal untilMarch 31, 1990'' on this money, said Sergio Amaral, Brazil'ssecretary for international affairs at the ministry of finance. Thecountry also has not reduced its principal on bank debt.</TEXT></DOC>
