After getting $17 million a year for the past three yearsin its previous contract with SportsChannel America, the NHLwill be lucky to get half that in its next network contract-- if it can work one out. Hockey's troubles likely are thefirst sign of a collapse in the sports-televisionmarketplace, after three years of soaring prices for TVcontracts for most major sports.</LP><TEXT>   The league currently is negotiating with SportsChannel,which lost about $10 million a year in its previous hockeycontract, and with Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s 80%-owned ESPNsports network. That the NHL was willing to start without amajor network deal was one indicator of just how deep are theprice cuts being demanded by the cable bidders.   &quot;We're going to have to market better and find additionalsources of revenue. You scrape and scrounge wherever youcan,&quot; says NHL President John A. Ziegler. He notesoptimistically, however, that national cable rights make uponly about 4% of the league's total revenue.   In some ways, hockey is paying the price of exorbitantbidding for most major sports, and all because of bad timing:Its three-year contract came up for renewal just as thelosses began piling up for other sports contracts that won'thave to be renegotiated for another two or three years.   CBS Inc. has run up losses estimated at $275 millionbefore taxes on its four-year baseball contract. All threemajor broadcast networks are expected to have a loss on atleast the first two years of their four-year NationalFootball League TV deals, now in their second season. ESPNran a sizable loss on baseball as well. Coming soon: the 1992Winter Olympic Games, for which CBS paid $243 million fortelevision rights for just two weeks of events.   The problem is that while cable and broadcast networksblithely agreed to pay average annual price increases rangingfrom 50% to 246%, advertisers -- the main source of revenueto foot the bill -- were willing to pay increases of only 15%or less for commercial time. Indeed, in some cases ad pricesfell, hurt by the overall ad slump and by a glut of sportsprogramming on local, cable and network television.   That bodes poorly for most sports leagues when it comestime to sign new television contracts. &quot;It's safe to presumethe rates of rights inflation will go way down and, indeed,some of the leagues will see some decreases in fees,&quot; saysRoger Werner, who negotiated dozens of television contractsin his 10 years as an ESPN executive. He now is president ofPrime Network Sports Ventures, which is controlled by cableexecutive Bill Daniels.   &quot;The major networks can't carry these things as lossleaders anymore. It's absolutely ridiculous,&quot; says PaulIsacsson, executive vice president of Young andamp; Rubicam Inc.,who oversees more than $1 billion in annual ad spending.   Yet sports leagues, flush with the promised proceeds ofrecent television contracts, have continued to run up hugecosts by signing multiyear, no-cut contracts with starplayers for millions of dollars, even as ever more sportsprogramming gluts the airwaves.   The one exception: hockey, whose players remainnotoriously underpaid in the big leagues of sport. That ispartly because hockey has long been the lowest-paid sport fortelevision contracts; the game is fast-moving, the puck istiny and the sport doesn't televise well. Detractors citeanother problem: fierce fighting.   Still, the timing of the contract talks and the severeprice cut that appears likely offer a cautionary tale forother big sports leagues. The NHL has spent months dickeringwith ESPN, which reaches 60 million homes, and withSportsChannel, which reaches about 15 million homes and isowned by Cablevision Systems Corp. and General Electric Co.'sNBC unit.   By late yesterday, ESPN appeared to have backed out of thetalks, according to people familiar with the negotiations.That makes it likely that SportsChannel could sign a deal foras little as $5 million a year -- less than one-third thecost of the previous contract, sources said.   One major snag in the negotiations with ESPN was thechannel's desire to have local blackouts lifted so hockeygames could be shown in the cities of the teams it iscovering. ESPN also wanted exclusive rights to games itcovered. The NHL resisted those concessions because teamsreceive far greater revenue for local television rights andgate receipts than from a national TV package.   Of the league's estimated revenues of $420 million lastyear, gate receipts made up 65% to 70%; 25% to 30% came fromlocal and national television contracts; and licensing andother revenue made up the remainder.   Besides the current unsettled television contract, theleague is struggling with other problems: an unresolvedcollective-bargaining agreement, two expansion franchises infinancial difficulty, and dilemmas over free agency.   &quot;This has been a lousy year for the business in general,&quot;says Joel Nixon, vice president of broadcasting for the NHL.&quot;And for us, this isn't going to be a $17 million season.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
