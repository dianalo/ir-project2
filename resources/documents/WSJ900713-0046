The anti-drug provision, adopted 331-88, builds onstatutes initiated by a few states, including New Jersey andOregon, and attempts to impose a national standard demandingthat persons convicted of drug charges lose their licensesfor at least six months. Enactment would be delayed for twoyears to permit legislatures to come into compliance, but anystate failing to do so would risk losing 2% of its federalhighway aid after Oct. 1, 1992.</LP><TEXT>   The action came as the House Appropriations Committeeseparately approved a $170.4 billion measure incorporatingmajor new funding for aid to public schools and medicalresearch but cutting sharply from proposed increases for anambitious project within the National Institutes of Health tomap the human gene. An estimated $66.1 million -- or lessthan two-thirds of the Bush administration's request -- isprovided for the program. Although another $18 million isheld in reserve, these funds can't be released beforeconsultation between the committee and a new NIH director,who has yet to be appointed.   Funds for the prevention and treatment of acquired immunedeficiency syndrome would continue to grow by an estimated13%, but the great bulk of an increase of more than $1billion for the NIH would be focused on research elsewhere.The committee set a four-year goal of generating 6,000 newresearch grants annually, or about one-third more than arecurrently financed, and the budgets for individual instituteswould grow in some cases by as much as 15% in fiscal 1991,which begins Oct. 1.   Within the Education Department, an estimated $5.4 billionis provided for Pell Grants for lower-income collegestudents, but the larger increases are in those programsfocusing on young, disadvantaged children in public schools.Reflecting the priorities of subcommittee Chairman WilliamNatcher (D., Ky.), compensatory education funding would growmore than $1 billion to a record $6.2 billion, and the billprovides another $2.75 billion for state grants forhandicapped education, or 36% above fiscal 1990.   Adopted 385-31, the transportation bill is the fifth ofthe annual appropriations measures to clear the House. Whiledeficit-reduction talks continue between Congress and theadministration, the committee leadership is positioned tocomplete action soon on the remaining legislation coveringthe heart of the domestic budget. A $20.7 billion Treasuryand Postal Service bill is scheduled to come to the floortoday, and besides the Labor, Education and Health and HumanServices bill reported yesterday, a $50.35 billionagriculture and rural-development measure could go to thefloor soon after.   The rush of legislation puts pressure on the Senate tofollow suit, and the leadership in both houses has virtuallyabandoned efforts to first craft a compromise budgetresolution. By a 16-5 margin, the Senate Budget Committeeyesterday approved its own shotgun solution, which allowsmore-modest spending increases than the House but wouldpermit an eager Senate Appropriations Committee ChairmanRobert Byrd (D., W.Va.) to at least begin drafting bills.   The resolution, quickly adopted by the full Senate lastnight, sets an overall limit of $488 billion for newdiscretionary appropriations in fiscal 1991 and $510.7billion for resulting outlays over the next year. The balanceis designed to help meet stricter Senate rules governingoutlays. Although no standard is set for the military share,the underlying assumption is that the Senate will be at leastas generous as the House toward defense, and any Senate cutsfrom House-passed bills will come out of domestic andforeign-aid accounts.   The higher domestic-spending figures in both houses dependon achieving as-yet-undetermined cuts from the militarybudget, and House Democrats so far have stalled in acting ondefense legislation for fear of betraying differences indeficit talks with the administration. Rep. John Murtha (D.,Pa.), chairman of the Pentagon appropriations subcommittee,has met privately this week with Army, Navy, and Air Forcesecretaries in anticipation of drafting his own outline of afiscal 1991 bill, but committee action could be delayed aslate as September.   By comparison, the rush of new highway and aviationfunding in yesterday's transportation bill won bipartisansupport. Despite the hue and cry over the deficit, thecommittee leadership easily defeated, 288-133, an effort totrim just $262 million from the measure.   The anti-drug amendment, sponsored by Rep. Gerald Solomon(R., N.Y.), rode a wave of popular, election-year support,but even as the chamber was proposing new penalties onstates, the bill itself was forgiving old ones. Among thespecial-interest provisions attached to the measure is one toblock the Transportation Department from withholding as muchas $46.7 million in highway aid to five states that failed tomeet standards for compliance with the 55-mile-per-hourfederal speed limit.   House Public Works Committee Chairman Glenn Andersonpersonally lobbied to protect $28.4 million for his homestate of California. Although less money was involved,another of those in violation is Connecticut, which reportedthat more than 71% of its drivers in a survey were travelingover the limit.</TEXT></DOC>
