The U.N. health agency cited 40 individuals and organizationsfor their anti-smoking efforts on the eve of its No-Tobacco Day, aworldwide effort to urge people to quit smoking or chewing tobaccofor at least 24 hours.   Pele was honored ``for taking the message to youth that smokingand sports do not mix,'' WHO said in a statement.   Actress Brooke Shields was cited for appearing on a publicservice poster that said ``Smoking spoils your looks.''   David Goerlitz, a former model for macho American cigaretteadvertisements, was cited for ``recognizing his terrible mistake inhelping to promote a deadly product,'' the agency said.   Goerlitz now works for private U.S. organizations that fightsmoking-related illnesses. He also testified before Congress insupport of laws to protect children against tobacco, WHO said.   WHO also announced a posthumous medal to lung cancer victim RoseCipollone, who won a landmark U.S. lawsuit establishing liabilityof cigarette manufacturers.   Danish rock and movie star Michael Falk got a medal forappearing in a video aimed at discouraging smoking by young people,WHO said.   The medals are to be presented at ceremonies throughout theworld Wednesday marking the second annual No-Tobacco Day, the themeof which is the health risks of smoking for women and girls.   Among the nations to most ardently embrace the day is Norway,where the government has officially adopted a goal of eliminatingsmoking by the end of the century.   A message nationally distributed on posters and bumper stickerssaid last year's No-Tobacco Day drew wide participation: ``Lastyear it was estimated that 240,000 Norwegian smokers avoidedsmoking. Two weeks later 40,000 of them had still not smoked and150,000 said they were smoking less. Now you have another chance.Good luck.''

It required special smoking sections in publictransportation, theater lobbies, banks, post offices and at workplaces occupied by more than one person.</TEXT></DOC>
