In all cases CT showed micronodulardensities that were roughly uniform in size and diffusely distributedthroughout the lungs. Density of each foci of the metastasis shadowswas lower than that of the miliary tuberculosis ones. Also, the shadowsof metastasis were fairly sharply circumscribed, whereas those of miliarytuberculosis were indistinct with fuzzy margins. These findings werehardly detected by conventional chest roentgenograms. The role of CTin the evaluation of diffuse nodular shadows and characterization oflung pathology are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
