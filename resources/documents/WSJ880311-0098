Gigot </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><TEXT>   In Super Tuesday's wake, a popular Washington pastime has been to ask, Whatever happened to Jack Kemp? Why couldn't the man who did so much to elect and animate the Reagan Administration convince Republican voters that he was its rightful heir?    Everyone has a theory, with &quot;decline of the conservative movement&quot; the Beltway favorite. The hindsight here, however, is that Mr. Kemp failed this time in large measure because he and his ideas have succeeded so well over the past decade. Mr. Kemp didn't try hard enough to -- or perhaps simply couldn't -- persuade Republicans to extend a revolution that most seem to believe they've already won.    In 1980, of course, Mr. Kemp's message of economic growth and opportunity was rock 'n' roll compared with Carternomics or traditional Republican blues. But seven years later much of that platform has been enacted: Tax rates have been cut and inflation broken. When did anyone last fret about &quot;bracket creep&quot;? The economy has grown by 20%. While many in Washington see the Reagan Administration in retreat, Republicans outside the Beltway don't seem all that worried that its achievements are in jeopardy. &quot;Despite all this talk about the deficits, people are still better off than in 1980,&quot; says Henry McMaster, Mr. Kemp's South Carolina chairman. &quot;Times are pretty good, so there's less willingness to take a risk.&quot;    That sense of complacency played perfectly into what George Will has called the Republican law of primogeniture. George Bush had loyally served the king, so he deserved to inherit the empire. &quot;I saw it again and again,&quot; says conservative activist Paul Weyrich, who remained neutral. &quot;People who would hear Jack would come up to him and say, 'Too bad it isn't your turn.'&quot;    Nor did it help that Mr. Bush, the onetime voodoo phraseologist, has been running as a semi-supply-sider himself. He says he won't raise taxes &quot;period,&quot; he'll cut capital-gains rates, and by last week he was even saying he doesn't like protectionism. &quot;Bush pre-empted a lot of the pro-Reagan mantle,&quot; says a senior Kemp aide. &quot;After Iowa, he really adjusted well on the issues.&quot; Exit polls in the South this week showed Mr. Bush getting a majority of even the conservative vote.    The Kemp campaign itself also probably did too little to distinguish itself from Messrs. Bush or Dole. An early mistake was investing about $1 million (out of $15 million total) for TV spots created by Phil Dusenberry, who had designed President Reagan's &quot;Morning in America&quot; campaign in 1984. The soft-sell &quot;image&quot; ads left viewers with a warm feeling but no special reason to vote for Mr. Kemp.    Later, Mr. Kemp gained momentum in New Hampshire with comparative spots on taxes and Social Security, but his strategists were averse to running positive message spots. &quot;I argued that 20% of the media buy should go toward pointing out the weaknesses of Dole and Bush, and the rest should go to tell people what you want to do when you're president,&quot; says Jude Wanniski, a Kemp adviser. &quot;Jack never did that.&quot;    In frustration, Mr. Wanniski says, he and a few allies raised $10,000 on their own to buy a four-page newspaper spread in Charleston, S.C., before last Saturday's primary. The spread stressed Mr. Kemp's optimistic vision of lower taxes, more jobs, opportunity for the poor through greater choice, and &quot;moving America forward but leaving no one behind,&quot; Mr. Kemp's &quot;Good Shepherd&quot; line. Though Mr. Kemp finished fourth in most of the state, he finished second in Charleston County (he still lost 3 to 1 to Mr. Bush).    Mr. Kemp is also faulted by many conservatives for not working hard enough to become, like Mr. Reagan in 1976 and 1980, the sole conservative voice. James Meadows, a Texas activist and Bob Dole supporter, says several big GOP donors turned against Mr. Kemp when he declined to support right-to-work laws. Jeff Eisenach, a Reagan official who became Pete du Pont's ideas man, says Mr. Kemp's refusal to make an issue of federal spending showed that he &quot;forgot the limited government message.&quot;    And Mr. Weyrich recalls going to see Mr. Kemp early on to warn him that he needed to corral the social-issue activists to forestall a Pat Robertson candidacy. &quot;Jack told me he almost voted against school prayer because he didn't want to offend Jews,&quot; says Mr. Weyrich. Adds David Keene, head of the American Conservative Union, and until recently an adviser to Mr. Dole: &quot;He should have run as the conscience of the party and movement.&quot;    Even if Mr. Kemp had united conservatives, however, my own suspicion is he probably wouldn't have won in any case. Too many conservatives are typically motivated by anger and resentments, and Mr. Kemp's message simply isn't resentful. The vast Republican mainstream, itself largely conservative, also just doesn't seem upset enough this year about activist concerns such as moral decline, the Soviet threat or even the budget deficit (witness the fate of Bob &quot;Bitter Medicine&quot; Dole) to toss out a vice president.    To win in November, of course, Mr. Bush will have to persuade more than satisfied Republicans, and Mr. Kemp's ideas -- what he calls &quot;progressive conservatism&quot; -- are still available should Mr. Bush choose to use them. Republicans may yet wake up on Nov. 9 to find Mr. Kemp a lot more appealing than he seemed in March. </TEXT></DOC>
