Harper and Frederic Forrest play Clara and Tim Brady, who lovethe young girl placed in their care but see her wrenched away, eventhough they complain the natural father is abusing the child.   ``When the child tells us she's been abused, the social servicescaseworker doesn't believe her,'' said Harper. ``Then a newlyelected judge takes her away from us and awards her to the father.We're told we have no rights, because foster parents are only paidbaby sitters.''   The two-hour movie, filmed in Texas, is based on a true story.It was brought to the screen by executive producer Marian Rees, whowon an Emmy for ``Love Is Never Silent.'' ABC will show the movieMonday.   Patricia Kalember co-stars as a TV reporter who supports theBradys in their quest to regain custody of the child. Marie Martinplays the child, Tella DeBusk, who is nicknamed ``Beans.''   ``It's getting to where the word of children is being taken moreseriously in court, but at the time of our story, in the 1970s, theword of a child wasn't taken seriously,'' said Harper.   ``It's amazing how much children are regarded as property. To alarge degree, the legal system treats children as property. Theyhave no civil rights.''   Harper said that even after physical proof of molestation wasfound, social service officials declined to prosecute the father.   ``Instead, they forced him to give up custody of the child,''she said. ``Tella was placed with another foster family. Theywouldn't return her to us, and they wouldn't let us adopt her. Wehad bucked the system and had embarrassed them. It was allvindictive pettiness. That's when the fight really began.''   The social services workers argued that the Bradys, only fosterparents, had become emotionally involved.   Throwing up her hands in bewilderment, Harper said, ``How canyou take a child into your home and not become emotionallyinvolved? You become emotionally involved with a pet. It's part ofnurturing and raising a child.''   The Bradys eventually got Tella back, but a trailer at the endsays, ``The child they got back was not the same child that hadbeen taken away.''   ``Her trust had been violated,'' said Harper.   The movie was filmed in the same area as ``Tender Mercies,''Harper's first film. She had been working in regional theater inTexas when she was cast by Australian director Bruce Beresford asthe young widow who becomes the salvation of a down-and-outcountry-western singer, played by Robert Duvall, who won an Oscar.   Harper was nominated for an Academy Award for her supportingrole as the obnoxious cousin of sisters Jessica Lange, Sissy Spacekand Diane Keaton in ``Crimes of the Heart.''   Before doing ``Little Girl Lost,'' Harper was in Minnesota againco-starring with Lange in ``Far North,'' written and directed byLange's companion, playwright and actor Sam Shepard. CharlesDurning and Anne Wedgeworth also star.   ``All Sam will let us say is that it's about a family in thenorth woods,'' she said. ``I can say it's good and I'm proud ofit.''   She also has another movie coming out, ``Criminal Law,'' withKevin Bacon and Gary Oldman. She plays a police detective, a roleoriginally written for a man.   ``I did three pictures last year,'' she said. ``I left in Julyand came back in December. Then I painted my house.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   ASTAIRE SPECIALS _ Three Fred Astaire specials, unseen sincetheir debut on television nearly 30 years ago, will be shown on theDisney Channel.
