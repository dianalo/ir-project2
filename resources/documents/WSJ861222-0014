Levine insider-trading case.    According to the U.S. attorney's office here, Robert M. Wilkis, a 37-year-old former investment banker at Lazard Freres, and Randall D. Cecola, 25, a former financial analyst at the firm, will waive indictment and plead guilty to criminal charges in federal court.    Mr. Wilkis already has settled, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, civil charges filed in July by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Cecola hasn't been charged by the SEC, although it was disclosed in July that he was being investigated. Mr. Wilkis's attorney declined to offer details about his client's plea. Mr. Cecola's attorney couldn't be reached.    The two men haven't formally been charged in the criminal case, but they are expected to plead guilty to charges that could include securities fraud, mail fraud or tax evasion. Mr. Wilkis is expected to plead guilty to more serious charges than Mr. Cecola. They would bring to six the number of Wall Street professionals to plead guilty to crimes in the Levine case. Mr. Levine is expected to be sentenced early next year.    The SEC had charged that Mr. Wilkis, who met Mr. Levine when both worked at Citibank in the late 1970s, exchanged confidential information about takeover targets and other transactions with Mr. Levine, a former managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and reaped about $3 million from insider trading while working at Lazard. Mr. Wilkis is understood to have implicated Mr. Cecola in statements to government investigators. </TEXT></DOC>
