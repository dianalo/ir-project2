The legislative body opened its regular session with the newmonarch's first appearance in the Japanese parliament since heascended the Chrysanthemum throne following the Jan. 7 death of hisfather, Emperor Hirohito.   The 55-year-old monarch, clad in a formal morning suit, saidJapan is expected to promote world peace and prosperity and act as anation that cherishes culture and nature.   ``I sincerely hope the Diet will fully perform its mission as thehighest organ of state power,'' Akihito said in a brief speech.   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and other top officials of themajority Liberal Democratic Party were expected to address theparliament, or Diet.   Opposition parties were widely expected to disrupt parliamentaryproceedings with demands that Takeshita or other top leaders resignto take responsibility for the involvement of prominent partyofficials in the scandal.   About 150 influential politicians, bureaucrats and executiveshave been implicated in the scandal arising from purchases of sharesin Recruit-Cosmos Co. prior to their listing on Tokyo'sover-the-counter market.   Although the government has determined the transactions were notillegal, the affair has raised suspicions of influence peddling andbribery due to numerous financial links between Recruit, politiciansand civil servants.   Political analysts here say opposition parties are certain todemand that key ruling party officials, who bought shares fromRecruit or received political donations from the company, mustresign to ``take responsibility.''   Opposition boycotts could delay passage of the most importantitem on the parliament's agenda, the $47.57 billion national budget.   The Liberal Democratic Party, which holds a majority of 297-203in the House of Representatives and a 143-108 majority in the Houseof Councillors, often attempts to gain the support of oppositionparties for its legislation.   In the past year, however, the party has abandoned traditionalconsensus politics on several occasions to make progress on cruciallegislation, forcing measures through the parliament despite bitteropposition from minority parties.   In December, the governing party ended a 10-year effort to reformJapan's tax system by forcing a set of bills through parliamentafter months of stalling by opposition parties demanding a thoroughinvestigation into the Recruit scandal.</TEXT></DOC>
