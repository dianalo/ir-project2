It is also found thata and b have good correlations with elevation h, precipitation W, andtotal cloudiness C, so a general correlation for estimating anti Hb canbe obtained. Yunnan Province, China, has the climatic characteristicof evident dry and wet seasons that correspond to November-April andMay-October, respectively. Utilizing the meteorological data of thesetwo seasons and the observed solar radiation data in four meteorologicalstations in Yunnan Province, a general correlation for estimating themonthly daily average direct radiation anti Hb incident on any horizontalsurface in Yunnan Province is obtained with the linear regression technique,that is, anti Hb/anti Ho = (-1.05 + 77.3/h + 8.34/Wd) + (1.76 - 87.62/h- 11.83/Wd)anti Kt in dry season; anti Hb/anti Ho = (0.34 - 24.5/h -6.14/Cw) + (-3.54 + 77.0/h + 36.70/Cw)anti Kt in wet season where h isthe elevation (m), Wd is the seasonally average monthly total precipitation(mm) in the dry season, and Cw is the seasonally average daily totalcloudiness in the wet season. Although this correlation is only applicablefor estimating anti Hb in the area of Yunnan Province, it is believedthat if the number of stations is large enough a general correlationcan be found, which can be applicable for estimating Hb in any area.</TEXT></DOC>
