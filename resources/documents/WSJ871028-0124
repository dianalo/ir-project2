U.S. officials said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze is expected to visit the U.S. later this week to reopen discussions on completing a treaty to eliminate the superpowers' medium-range nuclear missiles and on scheduling a summit meeting to sign it. In Moscow yesterday, a Soviet spokesman said the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty &quot;will be prepared for signing at the highest level, as this has been agreed between the leaders of our countries.&quot;    American and Soviet negotiators resumed work on the INF treaty Monday in Geneva and already have made progress toward completing it, said a senior U.S. official. If the talks don't stall, he said, the treaty could be signed next month.    Mr. Shevardnadze's proposal to reopen talks with Secretary of State George Shultz, the public statement from Moscow, and the businesslike atmosphere at the negotiating table all suggest that Mr. Gorbachev may be reconsidering his effort to wring new concessions out of Mr. Reagan.    On Friday, the Soviet leader had told Mr. Shultz he wasn't ready to set a date to meet with the president and suggested a summit might not be possible unless the U.S. agreed to limit development of space-based missile defenses.    It isn't clear, however, whether Mr. Gorbachev has reversed himself and now is prepared to visit the U.S. and sign an INF treaty, or whether he is still trying to use the promise of a summit to win concessions.    While indicating that the Soviet leader may meet Mr. Reagan &quot;in the near future,&quot; Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Boris Pyadyshev yesterday hinted that a summit is still contingent on the superpowers reaching an agreement about how the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty applies to Mr. Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.    Mr. Pyadyshev told reporters in Moscow, &quot;We can only say that this visit will take place when work is finalized on the medium and shorter arms and also when some agreements of principle are worked out on key provisions in the area of strategic arms and in the area of measures to strengthen the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.&quot;    Administration officials, however, say the speed with which Mr. Gorbachev has dispatched his foreign minister to Washington suggests the Soviet leader realizes he may have miscalculated last week when he refused to schedule a summit. The crude negotiating ploy, one official said, has undermined Mr. Gorbachev's carefully nurtured image as a more sophisticated, more reasonable Soviet leader and has prompted some Democrats and most of America's European allies to rally around Mr. Reagan. &quot;I always thought it was a last-ditch negotiating tactic, and it did look sort of churlish,&quot; said one State Department official.    The rapid turnaround also suggests that Mr. Gorbachev's balk was his own idea, not one forced on him by more cautious members of the ruling Politburo, and that he retains the power to make -- and reverse -- bold foreign policy moves.    Even if Mr. Gorbachev continues to angle for restraints on strategic defenses, U.S. officials said yesterday he isn't likely to succeed, and it will be hard for him to avoid meeting President Reagan to sign a treaty. &quot;Things are picking up speed, and we'll probably have a summit before the end of the year,&quot; one senior U.S. official said.    Even if that prediction is correct, however, Mr. Gorbachev may no longer be willing to cooperate in making the summit a full-dress tour and photo opportunity, as White House officials have hoped, the official cautioned. &quot;Even if he's willing to come here to sign a treaty, Gorbachev may not be eager to look at all the swimming pools in Malibu.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
