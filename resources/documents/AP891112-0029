(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Luella Wilson's tiny frame and stoopedwalk are misleading. This 91-year-old woman, who stands to lose herhome and life savings because of an unusual court case, is tough.   In her younger years, Wilson stood her ground on huntingexpeditions for coyotes and moose; trophies hang in her home toprove her success. She also ran her family's dude ranch for years,caring for up to 52 horses until last year.   Shuffling around her cluttered home and pointing out prizedpossessions, Wilson boasts that she once owned a nightclub and``handled'' eight bartenders _ not to mention rowdy patrons.   But Wilson fears she's finally met her match in the legal system.   She's uncharacteristically confused, tangled in a legalnightmare she says is not of her own making, but which threatens tocost her everything she has collected over her nine-plus decades.   Wilson's troubles began in 1984 when she gave her great-nephew,Willard Stuart, $6,300 for his 18th birthday to buy a car. AlthoughStuart did not have a driver's license _ Wilson knew that when shegave him the money _ he drove the car.   Three weeks later, after a night of heavy drinking and smokingmarijuana, Stuart drove the car off a bridge. A backseat passenger,Mark Vince, was paralyzed and later had a leg amputated.   The passenger sued Wilson, saying she knew that Stuart did nothave a license and that he used drugs, and therefore was negligentin giving him money to buy a car.   A Superior Court jury agreed, ordering Wilson to pay thepassenger $950,000 in damages. Her home has been inventoried forsale and her savings locked up by the courts.   The Vermont Supreme Court, however, says others may share theblame with Wilson, including the dealership that sold Stuart thevehicle. A Superior Court jury will decide that question inDecember.   ``He used to be my favorite nephew,'' Wilson said last week.``His mother used to get him up in the morning, dress him, and hewould come running through my meadow and stay here with me allday.''   Although he still lives nearby, Wilson hasn't talked to Stuartsince the verdict and has seen him only in passing as he drives byher home.   ``I don't know if he feels so bad about it that he doesn't wantto talk to me,'' she said. ``When you get into an awful mess, youdon't know how people are going to feel about it.''   Publicity over Wilson's plight has sparked a wave of support,and her kitchen table is littered with about 50 letters from peopleoffering money or assistance.   Others around the nation are watching this case because of itsprecedent-setting potential.   They say there would be enormous ramifications if the courtfinds either the dealership or salesman negligent for selling thecar to someone who did not have a license and was later in anaccident.   Such a ruling could affect banks, other car dealerships, oranyone who lends or gives money to another individual.   The passenger's attorney, Rolf Sternberg, told The New YorkTimes recently that the ruling is in keeping with legal doctrinethat a person who gives a dangerous tool to another is liable forany resulting damage, and said Wilson's claims of poverty areexaggerated.   ``She is not destitute,'' Sternberg said. ``The court order saidher assets are to be frozen except for what she needs to liveadequately. Somebody is trying to make it difficult to pick a fairand impartial jury.''   Wilson says the law is wrong, that there is no one to blame butthose directly involved in the accident. She believes she is guiltyonly of giving her nephew a certified check and the sole reason shewas sued is that she is the only one with any money.   Wilson, who was hospitalized last month after collapsing in herkitchen, vows to attend court in December, saying her failure toattend the original proceeding and tell her side of the story mayhave cost her the case.   ``When you have to walk so far, you can't go into a place likethat,'' Wilson said of the courthouse.   For now, her world is her home. She smiles at the good old dayseven as she awaits the court's decision.   The lesson to be learned? ``If you have any relatives, justdon't give them nothing. Don't give them any money,'' Wilson said.</TEXT></DOC>
