It follows from obtainedresults that short PA duration at rather low levels of nuclear doping(N{similar_to}10/sup 17/ cm/sup -3/) enables to preserve the transmutatedGe atoms in genetic points of Ga sublattice; this provides low degreeof compensation. Higher T/sub PA/ are required for RD annealing and electricactivation of transmutated additions as the level of doping (and neutronfluence consequently) grows. This results to Ge concentration increasein As points and the growth of compensation degree. It is possible thatcomplete that complete reduction of the crystal lattice can't be achievedat high neutron fluences.</TEXT></DOC>
