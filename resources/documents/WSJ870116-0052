In a report, the inspector general voiced doubts about the agency's authority to build two dams and modify two others in the &quot;Plan Six&quot; portion of the project, which is intended to provide flood control for Phoenix and additional water for central Arizona. The disclosure comes just after the administration proposed accelerating construction of the project in fiscal 1988.    The $1.1 billion cost of Plan Six, the report figured, is more than five times what Congress authorized, indexed for inflation, which was $166 million. The department's solicitor has said the agency should ask Congress for additional authority whenever the indexed cost of &quot;any feature of the project&quot; significantly exceeds the authorization.    The department's Bureau of Reclamation calculated that Plan Six's cost exceeds the indexed original authority only by $226 million, an amount it called &quot;not significant,&quot; the report said.    Moreover, Secretary Hodel concluded that there was no separate ceiling set by Congress on that portion of the project, a spokesman said.    The National Wildlife Federation, which released the report, claimed Plan Six is &quot;dead in the water&quot; until Congress boosts its authorization. It said legal doubts about federal funding would drive up the cost to local authorities of borrowing their necessary $350 million contribution to the total cost of the project. </TEXT></DOC>
