He is unaware of the human drama unfolding around him as hismother, Terry, battles court officials and the bureaucracy to adopthim.   Foreigners, most of them from the United States, are coming toPeru in growing numbers to adopt infants, despite sometimesnightmarish problems. Light-skinned foreigners with Indian babiesare a common sight in Lima.   ``Couples wait for years in the United States,'' said anAmerican lawyer who specializes in adoptions in Lima. ``Peru isfaster.''   Abortions, family planning and a more organized welfare systemin the United States turn adoptions into a five-year process. Mostadoptions also involve older children.   During an interview in the American lawyer's office, thetelephone rang every few minutes with calls from new clients.Peru's appeal has soared since other countries, such as Colombia,made adoptions more difficult.   Phillip is one of thousands of babies offered for adoption bypoor, single Peruvian mothers who are unable to feed or educatethem.   This poverty-stricken Andean nation of 22 million, mired in itsworst economic crisis, has discovered it has something many peoplein other countries want: babies.   Cuanto, an economics magazine, observed tongue-in-cheek thatPeru could pay its $20 billion foreign debt by selling 1.3 millionbabies for adoption abroad.   Newspapers and television stations, noting the growing presenceof foreign couples, have begun dedicating more space to babytrafficking scandals.   They reported that an unmarried woman in Lima tried to sell herthree children to an Italian couple for $10,000, but the fatherhalted the deal.   Another woman, who left her 6-month-old daughter with a friendfor several weeks, said in a television interview the friend handedthe baby over to a European couple.   Foreign couples, who begin caring for the babies before they areawarded custody, frequently find themselves caught up incomplicated legal proceedings. Critics attribute some lengthyadoption cases to court officials seeking bribes.   The American lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthe process is sometimes slowed by ``a sense of national shame thatthe country can't support its own children.''   Terry Shaffer, 30 and single, left her home in Ellicott City,Md., four months ago to adopt a child in Peru. Since then, she haslost her job as an epidemiologist and is being supported by herparents.   Her adopted child, Phillip, is from Ayacucho, a remotemountainous region ravaged by a leftist insurgency.   Ms. Shaffer had to face formidable paperwork before the adoptionprocess even began: documents certifying her birth and mental andphysical health; copies of her passport and tax returns; letters ofreference and employment, even FBI assurance that she had nocriminal record.   All of it had be translated into Spanish and notarized.   ``I gave in everything, but the case took so long we got boggeddown, so the judge threw the case out and we started all overagain,'' Ms. Shaffer said.   Linda Carey of Laurel, Md., had an easier time.   Ms. Carey, in her 40s and single, took two months to do thepaperwork. She now has her 5-month-old daughter, Johanna Elizabeth,from a poor family in Peru's rural north.   Before a child can be taken to the United States, consularofficials in Peru examine the papers to make sure the adoption islegal.   The American lawyer said a successful adoption in Peru dependson the right combination of judge, lawyer and biological mother.   ``Well picked, they can make the adoption a happy, lovingexperience,'' he said. ``Badly chosen, they can make it the mostemotionally distressing experience you've ever had in your life.''   He said lawyers' fees for adoption cases average $6,000-$9,000.   ``A lot of that goes on wining and dining the judge and bringingthe natural mother to Lima, all medical expenses paid,'' he said.   Two years ago, American missionaries Ed and Pam Baumgartner, whohave lived in Peru eight years, took in four battered children froma broken home in Pucallpa, a jungle town.   When the children, of four different fathers, said they wantedto stay with the Americans, the Baumgartners applied for adoption.That was nine months ago.   ``What delayed things is that we refused to bribe a singleofficial,'' Mrs. Baumgartner said. ``Now the fathers arethreatening to show up. I'm dreading that. They're going to wantmoney.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Friday AMs, Dec. 14</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
