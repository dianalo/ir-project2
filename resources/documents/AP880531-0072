But that agreement, signed in the Kremlin by Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze asPresident Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachevlooked on, is only a slice of the unfinished Strategic ArmsReduction Treaty (START).   That accord remains elusive, although both Reagan and Gorbachev,answering reporters' questions at the outset of their day of summittalks, voiced fresh optimism that it can be achieved.   The testing accord is what has come to be called aconfidence-building measure. Last weekend, senior Reaganadministration officials said it was snagged in a dispute with theSoviets, who wanted a broader agreement.   The differences were worked out by senior American and Sovietnegotiators, under the direction of Reagan and Gorbachev, alongwith another agreement, providing for joint tests this summer inNevada and at Semipalatinsk of U.S. and Soviet devices to measurethe force of blasts.   Asked why Reagan and Gorbachev did not sign the pacts, GennadyGerasimov, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman quipped. ``It'stoo small for them. It`s important, but not that important.''   The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, called thepre-notification accord ``a practical new step designed to reducethe risk of misinterpretation, miscalculation, or accident.''   The notice of a test launching must be given at least 24 hoursin advance and will be made through risk-reduction centers inWashington and Moscow.   A third accord extending for three years and expandingU.S-Soviet cultural exchanges was signed by Charles Z. Wick, thedirector of the U.S. Information Agency, and by Soviet CultureMinister Vasuky Zamharov.   Six other agreements were signed later at the foreign ministry.   One gives fishermen in the two countries access to each other'swaters. Another provides for cooperation between the U.S. CoastGuard and the Soviets in search and rescue operations. A thirdextends cooperation in radio navigation techniques.   A fourth agreement extend a 1973 accord for peaceful uses ofatmomic energy. Another sets up five working groups to explorecooperation in solar and other outer space programs. A sixth callsfor cooperation in transportation.   ``You see the harvest,'' Shevardnadze told reporters with asmile.   Asked when the START treaty would be ready, Shultz saidnegotiating the terms was ``a hard job.'' Shevardnadze added:``Generally speaking, it's in the fall that we collect theharvest.''   Shultz signed all six accords for the United States.Shevardnadze signed four for the Soviet Union. The fisheriesagreement was signed by Nikolai I. Kotlyar, the fisheries minister,while Boris L. Tolstykh, chairman of the state committee forscience and technology, signed the transportation accord.   Shultz and Shevardnadze then resumed their negotiations.   Negotiators working on arms control, human rights, bilateral andregional issues met this morning and were to report their progresslater in the day to Shultz and Shevernadze, officials said.   Two senior U.S. officials, briefing reporters separately underrules which barred disclosure of their names, scaled down anoptimistic account by Gerasimov of progress toward resolving otherarms control disputes.   Nor was there any sign from either side of a breakthrough on theU.S. program to develop a defense in space against ballisticmissiles. Even if other issues are resolved, the Soviets haverefused to complete the START treaty until the Star Wars dispute isresolved.   ``The two sides could not convince each other,'' Gerasimov said.   The Soviets and many American analysts contend the U.S. programthreatens the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. It limitsdefenses on the theory a potential aggressor would be inhibited ifhe faced the prospect of devastating retaliation.   The Reagan administration argues the program is not in conflictwith the treaty.   On START, Gerasimov said, the United States cleared the way toremoving one of five major obstacles to a treaty, dropping a demandfor a ban on mobile missiles.   But the senior White House official disagreed, saying the U.S.position ``at this point is a ban on mobiles missile. We are stilldiscussing it.''   Soviet officials said before the summit that they thought theUnited States was ready to agree to allow mobile missiles if theycould be restricted to a specific area and monitored by spysatellites and possibly through on-site inspection.   Gerasimov told reporters that ``mostly all the questions ofverification have been agreed upon ... about the territory wherethese missiles are going to be stationed.''   But the U.S. official said ``we haven't heard a verificationscheme that could work.''   Evidently, there was progress on counting cruise missiles aboardwarplanes, though Gerasimov again was more upbeat than the U.S.official.   One American official reported some progress but no breakthroughon the counting rules, and said the United States would considerany scheme the Soviets propose for verifying compliance on ceilingsfor mobile land-based intercontinental ballitic missiles.   The Soviets have deployed two mobile missiles, the SS-24 andSS-25. The United States is developing one of its own, theMidgetman.   Gerasimov complained that the United States was balking at aSoviet proposal to remove a third obstacle to the START accord,verifying limits on the number of cruise missiles carried by shipsand submarines.   The United States has rejected conducting an experiment theSoviets say will demonstrate a technology to detect the presence ofnuclear weapons aboard warships by detecting the emission ofneutrons and gamma rays.   ``We think this is not a serious approach at all,'' Gerasimovsaid. ``Send us two warships and we will tell you which one of themcarries these nuclear weapons without touching them.''</TEXT></DOC>
