The investigation was disclosed after Yang Chang Mo, founder and former chairman of the group, Kukje-ICC, filed suit Saturday demanding the return of 5.99 billion won ($8 million) in company stock he signed over to Hanil Synthetic Fiber Co. in February 1985.    Mr. Yang alleges he was forced to sell 12 million shares for one won each because he didn't contribute enough to the Saemaul Undong, or New Development Movement, and the Ilhae Foundation.    Saemaul, a government-supported rural-development agency, was headed for seven years by the former president's younger brother, Chun Kyung Hwan, who has been the subject of intensive investigation. The younger Mr. Chun and eight others were arrested last week on charges of bribery, embezzlement and influence peddling at the agency.    The Ilhae Foundation, a think tank sponsored by the former president, was founded in 1984 and funded by the nation's chief business groups. The foundation repeatedly has come under attack by the political opposition, which charges that Ilhae was a conduit for millions of dollars in business kickbacks to Mr. Chun, his family and political cronies.    During the seven years that Mr. Chun was president, the nation's top 12 corporations each were forced to contribute 10 billion won a year to Ilhae and Saemaul, according to an official at one of the companies, who declined to be identified. But foundation officials call that allegation preposterous and deny that any Ilhae donations were siphoned off to the Chun family or its friends.    Prosecutors say the investigation is focused on Mr. Yang's allegations that Kukje-ICC was dismembered and made to sell its subsidiaries and affiliated companies at cut-rate prices to groups favored by the government. The executive alleges that Kim Chung Won, chairman of Hanil Synthetic, made a 300 million-won contribution to Saemaul in 1984 in return for Chun Kyung Hwan's influence in forcing Mr. Yang to sell his Kukje-ICC shares to Hanil Synthetic at a low price.    Mr. Yang's suit charges that in February 1985 the president of Cheil Bank, Kukje-ICC's prime bank, forced him to sign over his shares in the company to Hanil Synthetic. Mr. Yang says the banker told him that the order to disband Kukje-ICC came from &quot;above,&quot; and that if he resisted, many people would be hurt.    Mr. Yang alleges that in 1983, Kukje-ICC donated 300 million won to Saemaul, while Tongkuk Steel gave three billion won. When Kukje-ICC was broken up, he says, Tongkuk was designated to take over its Union Steel Co. affiliate.    At the time, some business leaders scoffed at the government's explanation that Kukje-ICC was heavily indebted and on the brink of collapse. They note that many major Korean companies are overextended to the point where they could be considered technically insolvent.    &quot;Anytime the government chooses to close one down or break it up, it can do so,&quot; says the manager of a foreign bank in Seoul. &quot;All it has to do is call the so-called Korean commercial banks, which it controls, and tell them not to refinance that company's debt. That's what happened to Kukje.&quot;    The banker, who was involved in the case as a Kukje-ICC creditor, says the action &quot;sent a shudder through the business community that: 'You'd better play ball with Chun -- or else.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
