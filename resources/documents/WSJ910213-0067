The unions said the railroads agreed to a 60-day extensionof the current cooling-off period, which expires Friday. Thatdeadline was set last month under the Railway Labor Act aftera presidential emergency board issued its recommendations forsettling the wide range of contract disputes. The board'sreport was issued on Jan. 16, about nine hours before the warwith Iraq began.</LP><TEXT>   The rail unions proposed the 60-day extension &quot;so as notto interrupt rail transportation during this critical stageof the Persian Gulf crisis,&quot; said Richard Kilroy, presidentof the Transportation Communications Union and head of theunions' negotiating group.   The unions have rejected the board's recommendations,which included a 20% increase in the mileage that train crewsmust travel for a day's pay, letting either party seeklocal-level binding arbitration on the railroads' proposalfor trimming crew sizes, and reducing much of the workrestrictions that railroads dislike. They also included aseries of lump-sum wage payments and wage increases of 3% to4% through Jan. 1, 1995, and cost-of-living raises afterward.But under the board's plan, a big part of those wage gainscould be used to help cover the railroads' increasedhealth-insurance costs.</TEXT></DOC>
