The stock is up more than 100 points since last October alone, despite slipping 4 1/8, to 185 1/2, in yesterday's market rout.    A few analysts think Digital's ride is about over, but most contend the stock will go higher yet. &quot;This cycle in Digital stock is much longer (than past ones),&quot; says Carol Muratore, a Morgan Stanley analyst. &quot;They have a couple of years of good growth ahead.&quot;    Michael Geran, an analyst at E.F. Hutton, thinks Digital stock could rise at least 10% to 20%. Most analysts expect Digital revenue to rise more than 20% in the year ending next June 30, with earnings up at least 25%.    Fans say the market still isn't fully recognizing Digital's capabilities, and some think the company will gain more enthusiasts next week when it hosts a giant show in Boston called DECworld. The all-Digital show, unique in the industry, will let the company show off its snazziest products to some 50,000 people, including hundreds of top executives of the world's biggest companies, each personally hosted by a Digital official. Digital is spending more than $20 million on the show, but says resulting revenue may approach $1 billion.    In addition to stroking customers, Digital is expected to introduce several new, low-end products that are three times more powerful than their predecessors but won't cost Digital any more to build. And it will reinforce its message that its line of VAX computers all run the same software and can easily communicate as a result.    John Levinson, an analyst at Goldman Sachs who removed Digital from his buy list when it hit 165, says he thinks Digital will be only an average market performer in the next year. &quot;The big money has been made,&quot; he says. But he says &quot;over the next few weeks, it should do very well. This DECworld thing is an absolute industry phenomenon.&quot;    Digital stock -- nearly 80%-owned by institutions -- makes some holders nervous. They fear it can't keep going up and anxiously watch for any bad news. In July, when Digital announced fiscal 1987 net income of $8.53 a share, right in line with analysts' forecasts, the stock plunged because pretax profit wasn't as strong as expected. The stock rebounded the next day after analysts concluded Digital purposely held off sales into the current quarter.    Peter Anastos, a vice president of Alliance Capital Management in New York, which with more than 3.5 million shares is one of Digital's biggest holders, says, &quot;People still don't appreciate how much Digital has changed for the better in terms of marketing, financing . . . and product depth.&quot; He calculates that Digital sells for about 16 times projected earnings, about the same as the market as a whole and far lower than many computer companies.    Says another big holder, who declines to be identified: &quot;It's at about the same multiple as IBM, and there's no comparison between the two,&quot; because Digital is growing much faster and thus should command a higher multiple.    Early this year, analysts feared that International Business Machines' increased competitiveness could blunt Digital's success. IBM introduced its 9370 line of computers, which was internally dubbed &quot;the VAX killer,&quot; and it started promising improved computer communications and low priced departmental computing -- the same attributes that Digital boasts.    However, Marc Schulman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, says, &quot;It seems quite clear that efforts IBM has under way to counteract DEC's momentum have had little or no effect.&quot; He notes that IBM's domestic order rate remains sluggish. Moreover, Digital has continued to sell equipment in financial and insurance markets that were traditionally IBM's bailiwick.    Mr. Schulman says products introduced at DECworld will give Digital an opportunity to counterattack against the 9370 line. He predicts Digital will introduce a new version of its low-end MicroVAX computer. The same proprietary Digital microprocessor that will power that computer will also be used in an expected engineering workstation that analysts say will be called the VAXstation 3000.    Digital usually waits until the last moment before deciding on price, a critical question. Mr. Schulman says he expects the new MicroVAX 3 to cost about $30,000. It is expected to be three times more powerful than the MicroVAX 2, which has a $16,150 base price.    The new VAXstation also is expected to be three times as powerful as the cheapest VAXstation 2000, but cost no more to build. As a result, Mr. Schulman says, Digital could price it as low as its $4,500 predecessor. He doesn't expect it to be that cheap, but he says &quot;DEC is in a position to substantially increase its position in the workstation arena.&quot; Workstation rivals Apollo Computer and Sun Microsystems will probably have to cut prices, he says. &quot;If DEC should go for the jugular, it could cause (them) an extreme problem,&quot; he adds.    ---   Digital Equipment   (NYSE; Symbol: DEC)   Business: Computers   Year ended June 27, 1987:   Revenue: $9.39 billion   Net income: $1.14 billion; $8.53 a share    Fourth quarter, June 27, 1987:    Per-share earnings: $2.85 vs. $1.81    Average daily trading volume:   752,695 shares   Common shares outstanding: 127.9 million </TEXT></DOC>
