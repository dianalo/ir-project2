The chairman of a House Agriculture subcommittee, Rep. DanGlickman, D-Kan., called for the review of Richco Grain, aSwiss-based company with an office in Stamford, Conn., and paymentsit received through the export enhancement program.   Glickman said USDA needs to focus on the company's connectionsto Marc Rich, who renounced his U.S. citizenship and fled toSwitzerland in 1983 before his indictment for criminal tax evasion,racketeering, mail and wire fraud.   ``While I am disturbed that a company whose main operations lieoutside of the United States can establish but a nominal onshorepresence and qualify to receive EEP bonuses, as appears to be thecase with Richco Grain, I am truly shocked that a fugitive fromU.S. justice can benefit from a program funded by taxpayerdollars,'' Glickman said in a letter to Agriculture SecretaryClayton Yeutter.   Under the export enhancement program, or EEP, private exporterscan sell U.S. commodities at lower prices to meet foreigncompetition and then collect free government surpluses of grain orother commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.   Richard Crowder, under secretary for international affairs andcommodity programs, said he had not seen the congressman's letterbut that USDA had already started ``checking through what theconnections are'' between Richco and Rich. He said the review wasstarted to answer questions raised by Glickman about Richco at asubcommittee hearing in April.   An official of Richco, Al Church, declined comment about theUSDA review and would not provide any information about the company.   Glickman, in his letter, said ``an unmistakable line ofownership, control and profit runs from'' Richco Grain to Richthrough a series of subsidiary arrangements.   He asked that USDA's inspector general determine whether Richcohad qualified for the export subsidy program and whether departmenteligibility guidelines need to be changed to close any possibleloopholes used by Richco.   ``I believe that especially in this case, the department shouldtake special care to determine whether Rich's benefit from the EEPprogram, through Richco Grain, was camouflaged through subsidiaryarrangements with other business entities he owns and controls,''Glickman wrote. ``In short, has Rich and Richco Grain complied withthe letter of the law but flouted its spirit?''   Richco has the same telephone number as Clarendon AG, a U.S.subsidiary of Marc Rich andamp; Co. A.G. of Switzerland. The twocompanies settled a federal tax evasion case in 1984 by pleadingguilty and agreeing to pay more than $200 million in back taxes,fines and other penalties.   Criminal charges against Rich were unaffected by the settlement.The government alleged that Rich and his commodity-trading empirecheated the U.S. Treasury out of millions of dollars in taxesthrough a series of illegal oil transactions among Rich-controlledcompanies.   According to Glickman, Richco has received about $65 millionworth of subsidies through EEP, including about $250,000 for arecent wheat sale to the Soviet Union.   Last month, President Bush approved use of the subsidy programfor the sale of 1.5 million tons of wheat to the Soviets. Richcohandled at least 30,000 tons of the initial part of the wheat deal.Subsidies averaged $8.46 per ton for Richco and four othercompanies, according to USDA.</TEXT></DOC>
