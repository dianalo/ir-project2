Chipello (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> IND </IN><DATELINE> CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   American manufacturing plants continue to lag behind foreign competitors in computerized automation, potentially jeopardizing some one million U.S. manufacturing jobs, according to a new study by researchers at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.    A survey of 1,368 U.S. plants in 21 industries involved in metal working showed that less than 11% of the machine tools in use were computer-controlled, according to the study. More than half the plants surveyed hadn't any computer-controlled machinery.    The survey, by Maryellen R. Kelley and Harvey Brooks, was confined to U.S. plants, but the authors noted that one previous study estimated that 30% of all machine tools in Japan in 1985 were computer-controlled.    Ms. Kelley said the new survey also appears to support a study, based on 1980 data, which indicated that use of computer-controlled machine tools was relatively greater in West Germany, Sweden and Japan than in the U.S.    Ms. Kelley and Mr. Brooks said the slowness of U.S. manufacturers, particularly smaller companies, to adopt computer-controlled machines could hinder their ability to compete. Those who have invested in the machines are among the fastest growing, in terms of employment, they said.    The authors said that closer, more stable relations between large companies and small suppliers in Japan and other countries appeared to encourage investment by smaller firms in computer equipment. Their survey found that only 3% of U.S. parts suppliers receive any financial assistance from their customers toward the purchase of new technologies. And only 20% reported that their customers lent them engineers to supplement their own technical expertise.    The &quot;arm's-length relationship&quot; prevalent among U.S. industrial concerns and their suppliers makes such cooperation more difficult, Mr. Brooks said. He noted that U.S. auto makers, apparently influenced by Japanese competitors, have moved to tighten relations with suppliers.    The authors recommend, among other things, that government &quot;act as a catalyst to strengthen business-to-business ties that promote the transfer of technical know-how&quot;; that various steps be taken to encourage worker involvement in factory problem-solving; and that industry associations &quot;exercise leadership in promoting the adoption of new technologies among their members,&quot; rather than acting &quot;merely as lobbying agencies.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
