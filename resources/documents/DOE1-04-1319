<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-04-1319 </DOCNO><TEXT>For mixtures of vapours or gaseous health hazards, the tolerance rangeof concentrations at the workplaces does not depend exclusively on theMAK-values of isolated components. On the contrary the accumulation ofvarious primary and secondary effects on health restricts the tolerableconcentrations of the mixture to values below the MAK-values of isolatedcompounds. For the case of mixed components with parallel reactivity,a general rule is given and explained grafically. It defines the tolerancerange in terms of effective tolerance concentrations of workmaterials(WAK-values). This range may exceed the special tolerance range of concentrationsfor mixtures with unique (primary) effect on health, which may be determinedby a sum rule (given in TRgS 403) using MAK-values.</TEXT></DOC>
