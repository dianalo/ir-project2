This action is taken to comply morefully with the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) Regulations forImplementing; the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508).Proposed revisions to the Corps regulation were published for public commenton January 11, 1984 (49 FR 1387-1399). The purpose of this final rule is to clarify and streamline the Corps NEPArequirements on activities for Federal water resource development projectsand related lands. In addition, the Corps NEPA regulation governing theDepartment of the Army's regulatory activities (33 CFR Part 325, AppendixB) has been modified to reflect judicial rulings subsequent to our previousregulation and to reduce unnecessary delays and paperwork consistent withthe CEQ-NEPA regulations, recommendations of the Presidential Task Forceon Regulatory Relief, and recommendations of CEQ.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>March 4, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Office of the Chief of Engineers, ATTN: CECW-RE, 20 MassachusettsAvenue NW., Washington, DC 20314-1000.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Mr. Richard Makinen, (202) 272-0166for Part 230 and Ms. Janet O'Neill, (202) 272-0201 for Part 325, AppendixB.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Secretary of the Army has determined that this revision is not a ``major''rule within the meaning of Executive Order (E.O.) 12291. This is becausethe revision will not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100million or more; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, geographic regions, or Federal, State, or localgovernmental agencies; or (3) have significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment productivity, innovation, or on the ability of aUnited States-based enterprise to compete with foreign-based enterprisein domestic or export markets. The purpose and intended effect of this revision is to streamline the CorpsNEPA procedures consistent with improved management techniques to reduceunnecessary delays and paperwork. This rule is also intended to make theregulation consistent with judicial rulings. No increased paperwork burdenis imposed by the revision. This revision was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by E.O. 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Analysis </ITAG>Under E.O. 12291, the Department of the Army must determine if a regulationis ``major'' and, therefore, subject to a Regulatory Impact Analysis. Becausethe Department of the Army believes that this revision is not ``major'',it is not subject to such an analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>On 11 January 1984, a notice of proposed rule 33 CFR Part 230, EnvironmentalQuality, Procedures for Implementing the National Environmental PolicyAct (NEPA), was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(49 FR 1387-1399). A 60-day period for publicreview was provided. During this period, 44 letters of comment were receivedfrom a broad spectrum of interests including individuals, corporations,environmental groups, local and national associations, State, local andFederal agencies. Overall response to the proposed rules varied widely with perceptions beingdivided clearly between natural resource conservation interests and theresource users and developers. Six commenters expressed unreserved approvalof the regulation and twenty-three indicated strong support for streamliningNEPA procedures but recommended additional actions which would furtherstreamline and simplify procedures. Nine respondents, while recognizingthe stated purpose to streamline and reduce paperwork, questioned whethersuch streamlining and paperwork reduction would be achieved at the expenseof other more important NEPA and CEQ mandates. Two such respondents statedthat the proposal would undermine NEPA and another suggested that it wouldbe counter productive with respect to delays, confusion and litigation.It should be noted that many comments supported the proposed regulations.However, that support was not repeated on a paragraph-by-paragraph basisand is not repeated herein on that basis. The Army has considered and evaluatedeach of the comments received and has developed responses. Many commentsresulted in corresponding changes to the rules. Conversely, some did not.Keeping in mind both points of view, the Corps has endeavored to furtherclarify and streamline the procedures where possible but also to reaffirmthe environmental, action-forcing purposes of NEPA and the CEQ regulations.Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency determined that the proposedregulation would have unsatisfactory impacts on the quality of the environmentand referred the matter to CEQ on February 25, 1985. The major issues ofthe referral concerned the scope of the Corps NEPA review of regulatoryactions, clarification of the purpose and need, elimination of the requirementto discuss alternatives for non-water dependent activities in an EA fora non-controversial regulatory action, and the proposed 50-page limit forthe text of an EIS. CEQ published its findings and recommendations on thereferral in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 12, 1987 (52 FR 22517-22523). We haverevised the final regulation to incorporate CEQ's recommendations and haveadopted their suggested language on the scope of analysis issue that addressesthe determination of the extent of cumulative Federal control and responsibility.The following discusses the comments and Army's responses to the generaland specific concerns expressed on the proposed rules. Copies of all writtencomments received have been provided to CEQ and are available for publicinspection at the Office of the Chief of Engineers, Room 7119C, 20 MassachusettsAvenue, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of the final rule are also availableupon request. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Comments Main Text </ITAG>One of the most frequent issues noted in the comments was that the regulationis difficult to use because excessive amounts of information have beendeleted from the existing regulation and replaced with references to CEQregulations and other Corps internal guidance. A review of the Corps existingregulations on NEPA procedures indicated that a complete revision was necessarybecause it contained too much material not directly pertinent to implementingNEPA requirements, was too long, redundant in some cases, paraphrased orduplicated CEQ regulations, and contained agency informational guidancewhich is contained elsewhere in internal directives. This final rule reflectsArmy's efforts to reduce the length of the regulation by the use of appropriatereferences to CEQ regulations for implementing procedures, and to eliminateneedless repetition. By the use of references the guidance in the CEQ regulationstands, and this final rule is intended to be used in conjunction withthe CEQ regulation as a supplement. It does not modify the intent of CEQregulations. The Corps will continue to develop and implement environmentalprotection procedures consistent with applicable laws and statutes whilemaintaining the environmental review responsibilities under NEPA. 40 CFR1507.3 specifically prohibits agency regulations from paraphrasing CEQ-NEPAregulations or restating environmental policy. They are required to beprocedural in nature only. In addition, we have moved those portions of the regulation pertainingto regulatory actions (i.e. ``Appendix B'') to the regulations governingthat program. Appendix B is now published at 33 CFR Part 325, AppendixB. We have reserved Appendix B at Part 230. A number of commenters felt that the regulation is overly broad and opento varied interpretations with wide discretion given to district commanders.Specific examples cited as potential problem areas include actions normallyrequiring an EIS, emergency actions, inappropriate categorical exclusions,and determination of procedural requirements. We believe that these issuesare adequately discussed in the specific comments section of the preamblewhich follows. In general, we have revised the specificity of several sectionsof the final regulation to be as responsive as possible to the concernsexpressed. In addition, a provision has been added to require a periodicreview of the Corps experience in the use of categorical exclusions todetermine if modification of these exclusions is needed. The regulationreflects Army's policy to allow the district commander as much discretionas possible in carrying out the Civil Works mission consistent with statutoryresponsibilities and other essential considerations of national policy.<ITAG tagnum="84">General Comments (Appendix B) </ITAG>The majority of comments received on Appendix B focused on categoricalexclusions, scope of analysis for NEPA documents, and the discussion ofalternatives. The addition of a categorical exclusion paragraph is basedon a review of the Corps regulatory experience over the past four yearswhich has shown that considerable time and resources have been expendedon preparing environmental assessments for proposed permit actions whichdo not individually or cumulatively cause significant environmental effects.The proposed rule lists the actions which fit this category. In the finalrule we have modified the language covering these exclusions in responseto comments to achieve more compatibility between the categorical exclusionsfor permit applicants and those for Corps projects and activities. In addition,we have deleted the categorical exclusion covering concrete structuresand headwalls for intake and outfall pipes because the environmental sensitivityand potential impacts related to these types of actions should be evaluatedthrough the EA process. Also, the procedures which would allow districtcommanders to authorize additional categorical exclusions has been deletedand replaced by a procedure which calls for a headquarters approval ofproposed modifications to the list of categorical exclusions to achieveCorps-wide consistency. We believe that the Corps public interest review,section 404(b)(1) guidelines, and the existing coordination and certificationrequirements with concerned Federal, State and local governmental agenciesprovide adequate environmental safeguards for these types of minor actions.A requirement to prepare and process an EA for these types of actions wouldnot, in and of itself, increase the consideration and evaluation of thesignificance of environmental effects and would only increase cost andtime without any commensurate benefit to the decisionmaking process.Because the ``scope of analysis'' issue has generated considerable interestand some confusion, it might be helpful to review the concepts involved.The Corps of Engineers inquiry begins with a permit application which isevaluated, usually resulting in the issuance of a permit, often with specialconditions that modify the project, or permit denial. The Corps evaluationof an eventual action on the permit application is, by definition, the``Federal action'' for NEPA purposes (see 40 CFR 1508.18(b)(4)). The ``scopeof analysis'' issue arises when the application for a Corps permit coversonly a part of a larger project (e.g., the application for a Corps permitfor a pier which is part of a larger, upland oil refinery project). Insuch a case, the Corps must determine the ``scope of analysis'' which willguide all of our inquiries under NEPA; that is, what portion of the totalproject will the Corps cover in its EA describing the work, the range ofenvironmental effects of that work, alternatives to the proposed work,etc. Based on the scope of analysis adopted, the Corps determines whetherthe proposed work would constitute a ``major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment'', i.e. whether an EIS mustbe prepared. As explained in the regulation, the scope of analysis theCorps will use for permit cases normally will cover the regulated activity(e.g., the pier) plus whatever other portions of the project the Corpsdetermines to be within Federal control and responsibility for the particularcase in question. It is our intention to follow the judicial rulings clarifying the limitsof Federal action for NEPA purposes when Federal agencies issue permitsfor private actions. NEPA requires Federal agencies to consider the directand indirect consequences of Federal actions, not State or private actions.When the Federal action is the issuance of a 404 permit, then the activitywhich would be authorized by the permit is the subject of the NEPA document.The Corps authorizes the discharge of dredged or fill material in 404 permits.Therefore, the activity the Corps studies in its NEPA document is the dischargeof dredged or fill material. Similarly, under its Rivers and Harbors ActSection 10 authority, the Corps regulates work and structures in navigablewaters of the United States. Therefore, the activities evaluated in theNEPA document are those subject to section 10 of the Rivers and HarborsAct. The same principle applies to Corps authorities under section 103of the Ocean Dumping Act. Although it specifies a broad range of impacts which must be considered,NEPA does not expand the authority of the Corps to either approve or disapproveactivities outside waters of the United States. In other words, constructionof the upland facility may proceed without a Corps permit. The only activitylegally dependent on Corps action is the permitted activity. The CorpsNEPA document should address all aspects of the activity within its jurisdiction.We recognize, however, that in appropriate circumstances, the scope ofanalysis should be expanded to include portions of the project outsideCorps jurisdiction. The circumstances under which the scope should be expandedbeyond the limits of jurisdiction involve those cases where the Corps hassufficient control and responsibility for the activities undertaken bythe non-Federal parties so that the environmental impacts are essentiallya product of Federal action. The phrase ``control and responsibility'' is taken from judicial languagebut has proven difficult to articulate in regulations. As we gain case-specificfield experience with the interpretation of the phrase ``control and responsibility'',it is our intention to further develop factors to be used as guidance tofield officials in specific cases. Four factors have been developed fromexisting case law and are included in the regulation as examples of whattypical factors might be. Generally, in order to prevent the unwarranted situation where ``the Federaltail wags the non-Federal dog'', the scope of analysis would be confinedto the environmental effects of only the activity requiring a Corps permit.One specific application of the rule adopted at paragraph 7b(2) of AppendixB of this regulation on scope of analysis arises when a pipeline or electricutility line requires a Corps permit to cross a navigable water of theUnited States. In that situation, only the specific activity requiringa Corps permit (i.e., the crossing) including the structures in the immediatevicinity which affect the location and configuration of the crossing, wouldbe analyzed to determine whether the crossing would result in a significantenvironmental impact. The entire length of the pipeline or utility lineshould not be analyzed unless, in the judgment of the district commander,there is sufficient control and responsibility of the Corps of Engineersover the entire project to warrant an expanded analysis. This example is taken from the Eighth Circuit's <T3>Winnebago Tribes of Nebraska v. Ray </T3>621 F. 2d 269 (8th Cir., 1980),cert. denied, 449 U.S. 836 (1980), decision which addressed a situationwhere a power transmission line crossed a waterway. It was ruled that theCorps did not have control over the entire route of the power line so itwas reasonable to limit its environmental review to the immediate vicinityof the crossing. As another example, in the Fifth circuit decision, <T3>Save the Bay v. Corps of Engineers </T3>610 F. 2d 322 (5th Cir., 1980),the Corps did not review the environmental effects of an entire chemicalplant even though the outfall structure from the plant needed a Corps permit.This was because the Corps deemed the outfall to be a minor feature ofthe overall project and not sufficient to ``Federalize'' the project; theFifth Circuit upheld this determination. Also, there were alternativesavailable to the chemical company that would not require a Corps permit.Because of the wide variety of Corps regulatory situations, the degreeof Federal responsibility or interest varies. We have not attempted todefine at what point there is sufficient Federal control or responsibilityover the entire project to ``Federalize'' it for NEPA purposes. We haveentrusted this decision to the district commander to be based on a reasonableevaluation of the case-specific factual situation. In response to commentsfrom the public and governmental agencies, we have reworded this provisionto state more clearly our intentions, and to ensure flexibility and discretionfor the district commander. The language of this section reflects the reduction of paperwork and unnecessaryregulations consistent with the policy goals of the Administration anddecisions of the Federal courts. This language also reflects the judgmentof Army regarding certain examples to be considered by Corps project managersin determining the scope of analysis for NEPA documents prepared in connectionwith the regulatory program. Whatever portion of the project we chooseto cover in the scope of analysis, that analysis will include all direct,indirect, and cumulative impacts. The final rule on the ``scope of analysis'' issue adds another importantrequirement: whatever scope of analysis the Corps adopts for NEPA purposesfor evaluation of impacts and alternatives must also serve as the scopeof analysis for purposes of analyzing the expected benefits of a proposal.This rule is derived from the decision in <T3>Sierra Club v. Siegler </T3>695 F. 2d. 957 (5th Cir., 1983). The alternatives paragraph also generated numerous comments. The centralpoint at issue was that the language in the proposed rule was read by someas limiting the Corps review of alternatives to those favorable to theapplicant rather than requiring a review of a broad range of alternativesfrom a public interest perspective. The Corps position in developing thelanguage in this paragraph was to consider alternatives which are practicableand feasible in light of the underlying purpose and need for the proposalwhich, on occasion, is limited to the applicant's purpose and need. Itis our clear intent to examine all reasonable alternatives, including allpublic alternatives, if appropriate, but at the same time to not requirecostly and time-consuming evaluation of conjectural alternatives, the implementationof which would be remote and speculative.We believe that we have interpreted correctly NEPA and CEQ regulationsconsistent with recent decisions of the Federal courts, while maintainingenvironmental responsibilities mandated by Congress. Once again, in responseto public and agency comments, we have reworded this provision to clarifyits intent and to insure that only reasonable (and that all reasonable)alternatives may be considered by the district commander. We also received one general comment expressing concern about integrationof the NEPA review, other environmental reviews, and permit requirements.Our intent in this regulation and those governing the Corps regulatoryprogram (33 CFR Parts 320 through 330) is to emphasize the need for timelyaction by doing all environmental reviews concurrently with the processingand evaluation of the permit application. Step by step procedures are notspecified because of the variation in types of reviews and regulatory actions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments on Specific Sections </ITAG>Section 230.3 References. <T3>Comment: </T3>The listing of Corps regulations should include a title,other identifying information and the means of accessing each of the referencescited. The 18 references listed are of little assistance to persons unfamiliarwith the content or availability of internal Corps regulations. <T3>Response: </T3>We recognize that the extensive list, without identification,would not mean much to an outside reviewer and have limited the list tothose cited and have identified the references by title. The list of referencesshould only be considered as an informational guide to useful documentswith which a user may wish to be familiar and is not intended to be all-inclusiveor incorporated by reference as part of the regulation. Section 230.5 Responsible officials. <T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters suggested that the section in the existingregulation dealing with policy should not be deleted. They felt that itshould be reinstated in the final regulation to establish a policy andguidance framework needed to interpret specific implementation proceduressuch as those dealing with alternatives and wetlands. <T3>Response: </T3>40 CFR 1507.3 requires that implementing regulationsbe confined to the development of implementing procedures and may not paraphraseCEQ-NEPA regulations. The Corps regulation is so structured. The policiesin NEPA and CEQ regulations continue to be this agency's policies. NewandSection; 230.5 notes the officials responsible for various environmentalactions. Section 230.6 Actions normally requiring an EIS. <T3>Comment: </T3>Eight commenters noted that this section is confusingand may contradict the intent of NEPA. They noted that the degree of impactshould determine whether an EIS is prepared, not some ill-defined geographicarea, legislative status, judgmental standards or potential for litigation.In general, the terms used (major, significant) should be defined and specificcriteria applicable to Corps projects and permit cases should be providedfor district commander guidance. <T3>Response: </T3>In drafting the January 1984, proposal, we attemptedto classify typical Corps projects by degree of impact. However, we foundthat the impacts of specific types of projects vary so widely that suchclassifications would have too many exceptions to be meaningful. For example,a levee in a certain location or of a particular size may or may not havesignificant impacts depending upon many variables. The descriptions ofsuch categorical exclusions would contain so many caveats as to be ineffectivein providing useful guidance. The most reasonable and concise manner in which to describe actions whichnormally do and do not require an EIS turned out to be general categoriesof legislative authority. These are broad categories which fit the generalityand are intended to signal the public and the district commander what maybe anticipated in normal circumstances. Definitions of terms are those used in the CEQ-NEPA regulations. They arenot further defined by this regulation in order to avoid unintended modificationsto the CEQ-NEPA meanings. Section 230.7 Actions normally requiring an EA but not necessarily an EIS.<T3>Comment: </T3>Seven commenters provided similar or related commentson andSection; 230.6. <T3>Response: </T3>We believe that the response prepared for andSection;230.6 on actions normally requiring an EIS would apply generally to thecomments raised concerning the use of EAs. Section 230.8 Emergency actions. <T3>Comment: </T3>The general concern expressed by four commenters wasthat the proposed regulation does not conform to the intent stated in thepreamble to clarify that the district commanders are not excused from theirenvironmental responsibilities in emergency situations. <T3>Response: </T3>The final regulation has been revised to clarify thedistrict commanders' requirements.Section 230.9 Categorical Exclusions <T3>Comment: </T3>The issue most frequently addressed in the comments wasthe addition of certain minor actions to be categorically excluded. Therewas concern for the need for a clearer restrictive definition of when acategorical exclusion would be used. Nearly every categorical exclusionwas cited or questioned. Several commenters noted that certain categoricallyexcluded actions could result in serious environmental effects. Also, severalcommenters suggested that the list of categorical exclusions be expanded.A common theme among the letters was that the categorical exclusions forthe Corps projects and activities were more generous than for permit applicants,as reflected in 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B. <T3>Response: </T3>In developing the proposed regulation, Corps field officesfurnished data based on four years of field experience showing minor actionsthat were addressed by EA/FONSI and never resulted in preparation of anEIS. We screened the incoming data and prepared the proposed list for Corps-wideconsistency. Based on the comments received in response to the proposedrules and our continuing internal review, we have decided to delete ormodify certain categorical exclusions. We have revised the maintenance dredging exclusion to cover only minoractions using existing disposal sites. These recurring actions over theyears have had an insignificant effect on the environment. Moreover, environmentalsafeguards are also provided by compliance requirements with the CleanWater Act, Coastal Zone Management, etc. The proposed exclusion coveringthe disposal of less than 50,000 cubic yards of uncontaminated dredgedmaterial at an upland site has been deleted because of objections to thedifficulty in applying specific or limiting Corps-wide criteria for thistype of placement. We agree that upland disposal site impacts may involvea broad spectrum of environmental or other factors which are not readilydiscernable and should not be approved without review. We have deleted the exclusion for facilities at Corps projects such ashydropower facilities, which are subject to other Federal agency authorityand are categorically excluded by that agency. Commentors point out thatsome of these actions could possibly have serious environmental and operationalimpacts which might be overlooked because review would be limited. We concurthat a case by case environmental review of the proposed action would ensurethat the integrity of the affected Corps project would not be compromisedby the addition of these facilities. We have consolidated the proposed lists of activities authorized by grantsat Corps projects. Such activities, in order to be categorically excluded,must have been addressed in earlier Corps documentation. Based on the comments we have also consolidated and modified the languageconcerning real estate grants for rights-of-way to categorically excludeonly minor utility distribution and collection lines, including irrigation.Grants of leases or easements for other than minor electric transmissionlines, oil and gas transmission lines, road and highway rights-of-way,lands fills, and sewage and water treatment facilities, have been addedto the list of actions normally requiring an EA (andSection; 230.7(e) ofthe regulation). Grants for canals, ditches, dikes, retarding structures,etc. used in connection with fish and wildlife conservation and developmentprograms have been deleted as a categorical exclusion. We concur with comments that appropriate NEPA documentation should be accomplishedfor emergency projects constructed under section 14 and section 3 authorityif time constraints render this practicable and have relocated these projectsfor procedural compliance under andSection; 230.8 of the regulation. (EmergencyActions). Some of the commenters suggested that many of the proposed categoricalexclusions may have the potential to be environmentally damaging. We believethat the introductory paragraph to this section clearly puts the districtcommander on alert for circumstances which may dictate the need to preparean EA or an EIS, and further, that categorical exclusion does not exemptan action from compliance with other Federal laws. While the possibilityexists that under certain conditions an activity could cause a significantimpact, we believe that such circumstances would be extremely rare, wouldbe recognized and would be treated as exceptions to the categorical exclusion.Individual judgment on a case-by-case basis, as a result of the continuingenvironmental review process, is still necessary when deciding whetheran individual activity in a categorical exclusion grouping should haveexplicit environmental documentation. In addition, we have added a reviewrequirement to assess the categorical exclusions and modify or delete themif future assessment indicates a need to do so. Section 230.10 Environmental Assessment (EA) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter noted that the statement of purpose ofan EA is too narrowly defined, that part (b) requires corrective wordingto better correspond to 40 CFR 1508.9, and that certain agency procedureshave been deleted without explanation. <T3>Response: </T3>Part (a) of this section has been revised to describeaccurately the purpose of an EA. Also, part (b) has been modified to correspondto the wording in 40 CFR 1508.9. We have deleted requirements beyond those in 40 CFR 1508.9. The EA willreflect the results of necessary environmental studies and analyses andrequired coordination or consultation activities in connection with a proposedaction to provide the basis for determining whether to prepare an EIS ora finding of no significant impact (FONSI). It is important that the reader understand that the term ``environmentalassessment'' describes not only a document, but is also considered a processby which impacts or effects of a proposed action are identified and evaluated.This process is started at the outset of the consideration of a proposedaction, continues with other technical studies (informal coordination,literature searches, site visits, etc.), and culminates in a determinationwhether an EIS or EA is required. Additional information on combining orintegrating the EA into various Corps reports has been added.Section 230.11 Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters noted inconsistencies between thepreamble which states that the FONSI is the decision document of the responsibleofficial and as such is not subject to review and comment through the coordinationprocess, while the proposed rule calls for circulation and review of theEA and FONSI for certain Corps planning reports. Also, the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) commented that the EA and FONSI for <T3>all </T3>Corps actions should be sent to EPA to allow that agency tocarry out its authorities under sections 176(c) and 309 of the Clean AirAct, as amended. <T3>Response: </T3>To eliminate the confusion over the circulation of theFONSI, we have modified the regulation by including certain specific proceduraldetails covering various types of actions for which the 30-day review ofthe EA and draft FONSI applies, minor or routine actions which only requirecirculation of the notice of availability of the FONSI and operation andmaintenance activities involving the discharge of dredged or fill materialwhere the widely circulated public notice will note the FONSI determination.Corps reports meeting the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2) arealways sent to EPA for a required 30-day review. We have deleted the requirementto provide EPA a 15-working day comment period for minor Corps actionsfalling below the criteria of 40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2) since the 15-day reviewis not required by regulations or statute and was merely the Corps owninternal mechanism to double-check itself. Over the past four years, wehave routinely provided these documents on minor actions to EPA for the15-day review. Rarely, if ever, did EPA submit comments which would havealtered the Corps final decision. Since EPA gets notice of availabilityof all these EA/FONSI documents and can request copies in appropriate instances,they will retain full review opportunity with significantly reduced paperworkflow. We recognize that EPA's review authority contained in section 309of the Clean Air Act applies to those Federal agency actions specifiedin section 309 and we will comply with that statute. Section 230.12 Notice of intent and scoping. Sections 230.15 and 230.16 from the proposed regulation are combined inthis paragraph for clarification and renumbered. Proposed andSection; 230.12is renumbered andSection; 230.13. <T3>Comment: </T3>Five commenters felt that the Corps should describe howit will implement the scoping requirements rather than referencing theCEQ regulations. They suggested that the language in the previous regulationbe retained. <T3>Response: </T3>A review of the language in the previous regulationindicated that much of the material duplicated existing guidance on integratingthe EIS scoping process into the Corps public involvement program and,in some instances, paraphrased CEQ regulations. For this reason we believethat a reference to CEQ regulations which provides a complete discussionon agency scoping requirements should be sufficient. However, based ona review of the comments, we have expanded this paragraph to include additionalguidance on how scoping will be implemented. CEQ's Information Memorandumof July 28, 1983, provides additional guidance and has been added as areference. We have further modified this paragraph by incorporating thenotice of intent requirements, as required by CEQ regulations (andSection;1508.22), to consolidate Corps scoping guidance. <T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters questioned the use and availabilityof ER 200-2-1, an internal Corps regulation on preparing and processingnotices of intent for publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <T3>Response: </T3>We have rescinded ER 200-2-1 and incorporated it intothis final rule as Appendix C for program continuity. Section 230.13 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). This paragraph has been renumbered from andSection; 230.12 in the proposal.<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of commenters felt that restricting an EIS to50 pages may be unrealistic and fail to comply with the requirements ofNEPA, and that setting an arbitrary page limit could become an excuse fornot providing adequate information needed for a meaningful review and adverselyimpact decisionmaking. Two commenters also noted that the requirement tocirculate only summaries if the document exceeds 50 pages appears to conflictwith the public disclosure intent of NEPA and the CEQ regulations. Thecommenters suggested adherence to the language contained in the CEQ regulationscovering page limits and circulation of EIS summaries. <T3>Response: </T3>The Corps does not intend to limit arbitrarily the amountof information available to the public or to circumvent the legal and technicalrequirements for an EIS. Rather, our intent is to provide the public witha clear and concise text of an EIS that does not contain unnecessarilylengthy or repetitive material, and that is therefore easily read and understood(the content of the ``text'' of an EIS is described at 40 CFR 1502.10 (d)through (g). In this light, the regulation has been rewritten to rely onthe general page length recommendations provided by the CEQ regulationsat 40 CFR 1502.07 with the provision that district commanders should strivefor an EIS text that succinctly discusses the relevant NEPA issues in alegally and technically adequate manner. The new provision might, in somecases, result in NEPA documents that are substantially shorter than theCEQ's recommended lengths. The goal is to prepare NEPA documents whichbetter inform the decisionmakers and the public. The Corps believes that concise documents, when carefully written, willenhance rather than detract from the public's ability to participate inthe NEPA process. Circulation of EIS summaries is included within the AvailabilityandSection; 230.18. Section 230.14 Record of decision and implementation. This paragraph has been revised to shorten and clarify it, renamed, andrenumbered from andSection; 230.13.<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of commenters noted that the monitoring andmitigation section found in earlier versions has been deleted from theproposed rules with the statement in the preamble that those subjects areappropriately discussed in CEQ regulations at 40 CFR Part 1505. These commentersfelt that the agency should include their specific procedures for monitoringand mitigation as a necessary supplement to the CEQ regulations and recommendedthat the previous paragraph be retained in its entirety. <T3>Response: </T3>In concurring with the commenters, we have reinsertedmitigation and monitoring procedures into the final regulation at andSection;230.15 to eliminate any misconceptions that the Corps is decreasing theimportance of mitigation. This paragraph appropriately references the CEQregulations at andSection;andSection; 1505.2(c) and 1505.3 as applicable agencyguidance and has been reworded to clarify the term monitoring as that actionnecessary to insure adopted mitigation measures are implemented. An evaluationof the effectiveness of mitigation measures may be authorized or establishedas a project feature or a permit condition. This definition is providedto prevent the interpretation that for <T3>each </T3>and <T3>every </T3>mitigation measure there must be follow-on studies or evaluationto assess the effectiveness of the mitigation. Mitigation is an integralpart of the Corps planning and regulatory programs. It is included in aproject or as a permit condition in accordance with existing laws, currentFederal regulations, and internal guidance. Mitigation measures developedfor viable project alternatives, including the recommended plan or in thecase of a regulatory permit action the ``applicant's preferred alternative,''are discussed in the EIS and summarized as part of the record of decisionas required by 40 CFR Part 1505. The revised paragraph <T3>Record of Decision and Implementation </T3>has been rewritten to eliminatethe paraphrasing of the CEQ regulations on the content of a Record of Decisionand appropriately references the CEQ regulation as agency guidance (40CFR 1505.2). The repetitious instructions on which Corps official shouldsign the Record of Decision for the various types of Corps projects hasalso been eliminated since it is appropriately discussed in the processinginstruction in Appendix A and 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B. The exampleincluded in the new regulation is intended only to illustrate the recordof decision for a typical Corps action. Section 230.16 Lead and Cooperating Agencies This paragraph has been renumbered from 230.14. Section 230.17 Filing Requirements Paragraph (b) has been rewritten for clarification. Section 230.18 Availability This paragraph has been revised to allow fees to be charged in unusualcircumstances for reproduction of NEPA documents in accordance with CEQ-NEPAregulations 40 CFR 1506.6(f). <T3>Comment: </T3>One Federal agency noted that the preamble stated thatthis section would be modified to require preparation and circulation ofan EIS summary in certain cases whereas the discussion actually appearedin 33 CFR 230.12. One reviewer suggested that the discussion on the EISsummary should appear in this section rather than 33 CFR 230.12. <T3>Response: </T3>The incorrect citation in the preamble was noted. Circulationof the EIS summary in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.19 is included withinthe Availability paragraph. Section 230.19 Comments <T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters noted that the effects of allowing agencydiscretion to respond to comments on a final EIS may result in the lossof opportunity for comments and positions to be known about the preferredalternative when the preferred alternative was not identified in the draftEIS. Also, the section on public involvement was deleted without explanation.<T3>Response: </T3>In concurring with the comments, we are requiring thatresponses be made to comments received on the final EIS when substantiveissues are raised which have not been addressed in either the EIS or inresponse to comments on the draft EIS. We have also modified 33 CFR Part325, Appendix B of the regulation to indicate that the ``preferred alternative''means the ``Applicant's preferred alternative'', since the Corps is nota proponent or opponent of any proposed regulatory action. In the caseof other than regulatory actions the Corps preferred or tentatively selectedalternative is identified in the draft and final EIS. The separate publicinvolvement section was deleted since it duplicates the information containedelsewhere in the text of the EIS or accompanying report and is not requiredby CEQ-NEPA regulations. We have added those areas of special Corps expertise, also listed in andSection;230.15, upon which the Corps should provide comments when responding toother agency EISs. Section 230.25 Environmental Review and Consultation Requirements This paragraph was clarified to allow filing of an EIS where ongoing studieswould not materially affect the decision. Section 230.26 General Considerations in Preparing Corps EISs This paragraph was modified slightly to allow more discretion in the useof footnotes and to clarify the interaction in contractual relationships.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix A </ITAG>No substantive comments were received on this Appendix. Minor editorialchanges have been made to reflect current planning and engineering procedures.The procedure to be followed in a draft EIS after consultation with CEBRHhas also been clarified. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments on Specific Sections of Appendix B, Regulatory Actions </ITAG>B-2 General <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern that this paragraph refersto the basic regulation (ER 200-2-2) or the CEQ regulations (40 CFR Parts1500 through 1508) which in turn refer to the agencies' regulations forimplementing procedures. <T3>Response: </T3>We agree that the proposed language could be interpretedas leading the reader around a closed loop. The paragraph has been rewrittento state that these are implementation procedures. For additional informationthe reader should see 33 CFR Part 230 and, for policy see 40 CFR Parts1500 through 1508. B-3 Development of Information and Data <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the Corps ask for additionalinformation from the applicant as early as possible and should discourageadditional or repetitive requests. <T3>Response: </T3>We concur with this comment. The intent of this regulationand of the regulation governing the regulatory program (33 CFR Parts 320through 330) is to encourage timely review of applications including obtainingthe information needed as early as is practicable in the review process.<T3>Comment: </T3>Another comment expressed concern that key concepts ofthe Corps procedures regarding information to fully describe reasonablealternatives were deleted. <T3>Response: </T3>That is not the case. See the discussion on alternativesin paragraph 9.B-6 Categorical Exclusions <T3>Comment: </T3>Numerous comments were received on this paragraph. Somewere general, such as: Strongly supporting the concept; the categoricalexclusions should be drawn as narrowly as possible; actions listed forCorps activities should also apply to private applicants; and, activitiesconsidered are far too limited in scope to help spur economic development.Other comments were very narrowly focused, suggesting changes to the specificactivities such as: changing fixed docks to open fixed pile; defining smallor upland sites with important wildlife values; stating no fill in specialaquatic sites; and, adding ``except during construction'' to indicate sometemporary interference with navigation is acceptable. Several suggestedregional and nationwide general permits should be added to the list. Onecommenter felt the extraordinary circumstances language was too vague andcould lead to a broad range of interpretation and little accountabilityfor district commanders' decisions on what qualified as a categorical exclusion.There was a request for a return to the 90-day comment period for publicnotices for activities proposed for categorical exclusion. Some commentersrequested adding erosion control authorities to the list of categoricalexclusions. There was also confusion regarding activities categoricallyexcluded from NEPA documentation, the need for environmental assessmentsand the relationship between general and nationwide permits, letters ofpermissions, individual permits and other required State and local approvals.One State requested advance notification of activities categorically excluded.Finally a few comments opposed having district and division commandersdevelop ``local'' categorical exclusions as this could lead to a patchworkof different exclusions across the Nation and was counter to the CEQ regulationsand supplemental guidance. <T3>Response: </T3>We concur that, in general, the categorical exclusionsfor Corps activities and private permit applicants should be of the samegeneral magnitude. Therefore, we have modified the language concerningmaintenance dredging to limit disposal to existing sites and utility linecrossings to minor distribution and collection lines. We believe that afixed pier is generally understood to be either a concrete or wooden pieron piling. The language of categorical exclusion of 6a(1) and 6a(2) hasbeen changed to delete redundant references to interference with navigation.Navigation is always considered during the evaluation process and permitsare conditioned or denied as necessary to reflect this interest. The requestfor adding erosion control activities to the list of categorical exclusionswas considered, but we believe that the nationwide permits found in 33CFR 330.5 (a)(2) and (a)(13) would apply to most erosion control activities.Concrete structures and headwalls for intake and outfall pipes have beendeleted from the list. We have also removed the narrowly restrictive qualifyinglanguage in 6a(5) concerning boat launching ramps. The regional and nationwide general permits are permits for certain typesof activities for which there has already been a NEPA review and NEPA documentshave already been prepared on a generic basis. Therefore, it is not necessaryto add them to the list of actions categorically excluded from NEPA documentation.The actions listed as categorically excluded in paragraph 6 of AppendixB are not excluded from the requirement to obtain the proper Army permitand/or any other required State permits and certifications or local approvals.The listing simply means that the activities will usually not need a separateNEPA document. Therefore, activities listed as categorically excluded shouldnot be interpreted as being authorized. We have decided not to provide district commanders with more specific guidanceon where and what types of categorically excluded activities might requireadditional NEPA review. We believe that the laws and regulations with whichthe Corps and other Federal agencies must comply (e.g., Endangered SpeciesAct, Clean Water Act, National Historical Preservation Act) provide sufficientsafeguards to ensure categorical exclusions will be properly applied. Subparagraph(a) has been expanded to include specific discussion of this point. In addition, a provision has been added to require the district commanderto review periodically the type and number of categorically excluded actionswhich, because of case-specific circumstances, require individual NEPAdocumentation. This review would determine if modification of the categoricalexclusions is needed. This provision replaces the proposed procedures forthe district commander to develop additional ``local'' categorical exclusionsdiscussed in 6C. These new procedures require higher authority for approvalof changes to the list of categorically excluded activities in order toachieve Corps-wide consistency on a national basis prior to undertakingrulemaking changes. B-7 EA/FONSI Document <T3>Comment: </T3>This paragraph generated the largest number of commentson Appendix B. Several commenters expressed concerns regarding the EA nothaving to address alternatives in those cases in which there were no unresolvedconflicts as to resource use. These commenters also pointed out that 404(b)(1)guidelines require alternative analysis. Comments on the scope of analysisincluded: Commending the Corps; expressing concerns about expansion ofthe NEPA review based on the district commander's ``sole discretionaryauthority''; to concerns for limiting the NEPA review to the specific activityrequiring a Corps permit. Some thought the examples were good, others thoughtthey were confusing or should be eliminated. Some thought the scope ofthe NEPA review should be based on the overall control and responsibilitythe Corps has over the entire project. There was confusion on just whattriggers the decision to ``federalize'' the total project. One person commentedon the need to consider cumulative impacts. Another suggested that theimplied need to prepare an EA prior to preparing an EIS); where the activityproposed clearly required an EIS, was an unnecessary additional step. Finally,several commenters requested that the EA be provided during the publicnotice period for public and agency review. <T3>Response: </T3>We concur that where it is obvious an EIS is requiredthere is no need to prepare an EA. The regulation has been revised to reflectthis. The section concerning the alternatives to be considered reflects the languageand intent of section 102(2)(E) of NEPA and is consistent with policiesto reduce unnecessary paperwork and streamline NEPA requirements. We haverevised paragraph 7a to state that, if the impacts of the applicant's proposalwould not be significant (i.e. would require only an EA, not an EIS); andif there are no unresolved conflicts (i.e., no unresolved objections regardingalternative uses of available resources from Federal and State resourceagencies and members of the public commenting on the public notice or nonediscerned by the district commander); and, if the activity is ``water dependent''in the meaning of 40 CFR 230.10(a)(3) (for discharges requiring a section404 permit) the EA need not include a discussion on alternatives. However,there is nothing in this regulation which would preclude the district commanderfrom considering other alternatives in the public interest review for apermit application if it is appropriate to do so. This has been noted inthe regulation. The change in the scope of analysis is not an attempt to relieve the Corpsof responsibilities. Rather, it is to use good judgment in the extent ofanalysis and to incorporate the holdings of certain Federal court decisionsto better determine when the need to trigger an overall review or ``Federalization''should occur. The overall review takes place when there is a significantFederal interest, not just because of the need for an Army permit for aminor part of the overall project. Therefore, the district commander musthave the discretion to determine the significance of the Federal interestto justify the overall review. This section has been rewritten to clarifythese concepts, and the term ``sole discretionary authority'' was deletedto avoid any misunderstanding that the district engineer must comply withappropriate NEPA requirements.The EA is prepared after all comments are received on the public noticeand the district commander has had an opportunity to evaluate those comments.Hence, it is not possible to provide the EA for review during the publicnotice period. Concerned Federal and State resource agencies and the publicin response to the public notice provide the necessary input to the Corpsstaff in preparing the EA and form the basis for the district commander'sfindings on the case. B-8 Environmental Impact Statement <T3>Comment: </T3>A comment was received suggesting that the district commanderaccount in writing for time delays in processing an EIS. <T3>Response: </T3>District commanders presently are reporting on a quarterlybasis on permits over 120 days old and providing an estimated date whenfinal action will be taken. This report includes actions requiring an EIS.Several word changes were made for clarification. B-9 Organization and Content of Draft EIS <T3>Comment: </T3>Numerous comments were received on this paragraph. Themajority concentrated on the scope of review of alternatives required inan EIS for a Department of the Army permit. Many felt that the scope ofreview as written could require a review of alternatives beyond those theapplicant could reasonably accomplish, while others believed the scopetoo narrow and inadequate. Several suggested that a preferred alternativebe identified as the ``applicant's preferred alternative''. Comments onmitigation ranged from those who think it should be limited to those whobelieve it is being improperly de-emphasized. One commenter requested clarificationof the type of mitigation and monitoring programs legally required. <T3>Response: </T3>Our intent in this paragraph is to have reasonable alternativesconsidered in the EIS which could be implemented by the applicant. Wherenecessary for an informed decision on the public interest, alternativesbeyond those that could be implemented by the applicant should also beconsidered. The district commander's final decision, whether to grant ornot grant the authorization, or to grant it with modifications and conditions,which could require mitigation, is dependent on the result of the publicinterest review required by the Corps regulation at 33 CFR 320.4. Thatdecision is documented in the record of decision. Since the Corps is neithera proponent nor an opponent of any proposal, the final EIS will recognizethe applicants proposal as the ``applicant's preferred alternative,'' andthe regulation has been changed accordingly. In accordance with CEQ regulations(40 CFR 1505.2(b)),  the environmentally preferred alternative will alsobe identified in the record of decision. Paragraph 9b(5)(e) has been rewrittento clarify the mitigation considerations. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>33 CFR Part 230 Administrative practice and procedure, Environmental impact statements,Environmental protection, Flood control, Flood plains, Navigation, Waterresources, Water supply, Waterways, Wetlands. 33 CFR Part 325 Administrative practice and procedure, Intergovernmental relations, Environmentalprotection, Navigation, Water pollution control, Waterways.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 26, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Approved </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John S.

District commanders shall considerthe probable environmental consequences in determining appropriate emergencyactions and when requesting approval to proceed on emergency actions, willdescribe proposed NEPA documentation or reasons for exclusion from documentation.NEPA documentation should be accomplished prior to initiation of emergencywork if time constraints render this practicable. Such documentation mayalso be accomplished after the completion of emergency work, if appropriate.Emergency actions include Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies Activitiespursuant to Pub. L. 84-99, as amended, and projects constructed under sections3 of the River and Harbor Act of 1945 or 14 of the Flood Control Act of1946 of the Continuing Authorities Program.

However, district commandersshould be alert for extraordinary circumstances which may dictate the needto prepare an EA or an EIS. Even though an EA or EIS is not indicated fora Federal action because of a ``categorical exclusion'', that fact doesnot exempt the action from compliance with any other Federal law. For example,compliance with the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife CoordinationAct, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Clean Water Act, etc.,is always mandatory, even for actions not requiring an EA or EIS. (a) For a period of one year from the effective date of these regulations,district commanders should maintain an information list on the type andnumber of categorical exclusion actions which due to extraordinary circumstancestriggered the need for an EA and finding of no significant impact (FONSI)or an EIS. If a district commander determines that a categorical exclusionshould be modified, the information will be furnished to the division commander,who will review and analyze the actions and circumstances to determineif there is a basis for recommending a modification to the list of categoricalexclusions. HQUSACE (CECW-RE) will review recommended changes for Corps-wideconsistency and revise the list accordingly. See 33 CFR Part 325, AppendixB for categorical exclusions for regulatory actions.

The district commander is responsiblefor making this determination and for keeping the public informed of theavailability of the EA and FONSI. (b) <T3>Format. </T3>While no special format is required, the EA should includea brief discussion of the need for the proposed action, or appropriatealternatives if there are unresolved conflicts concerning alternative usesof available resources, of the environmental impacts of the proposed actionand alternatives and a list of the agencies, interested groups and thepublic consulted. The document is to be concise for meaningful review anddecision. (c) <T3>Integration with Corps Reports. </T3>In the case of planning and/orengineering reports not requiring an EIS, the EA may be combined with orintegrated into the report.

Where the EA iscombined with a Corps report or prepared as a separate document in thecase of construction, operating projects and real estate actions requiringan EA, the EA normally should not exceed 15 pages.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). </ITAG>A FONSI shall be prepared for a proposed action, not categorically excluded,for which an EIS will not be prepared. The FONSI will be a brief summarydocument as noted in 40 CFR 1508.13. In the case of feasibility, continuingauthority, or special planning reports and certain planning/engineeringreports, the draft FONSI and EA should be included within the draft reportand circulated for a minimum 30-day review to concerned agencies, organizationsand the interested public (40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2)). In the case of operationand maintenance activities involving the discharge of dredged or fill materialrequiring a public notice, the notice will indicate the availability ofthe EA/FONSI. For all other Corps project actions a notice of availabilityof the FONSI will be sent to concerned agencies, organizations and theinterested public (40 CFR 1501.4(e)(1)). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.12</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Notice of intent and scoping. </ITAG>As soon as practicable after a decision is made to prepare an EIS or supplement,the scoping process for the draft EIS or supplement will be announced ina notice of intent. Guidance on preparing a notice of intent to preparean EIS for publication in the Federal Register is discussed in AppendixC. Also, a public notice will be widely distributed inviting public participationin the scoping process. As described in 40 CFR 1501.7 and reference 3(m),this process is the key to preparing a concise EIS and clarifying the significantissues to be analyzed in depth. Public concerns on issues, studies needed,alternatives to be examined, procedures and other related matters willbe addressed during scoping. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.13</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). </ITAG>An EIS for feasibility or continuing authority reports and certain planning/engineeringreports may be combined with or integrated into the report in accordancewith 40 CFR 1500.4(o) and 1506.4. An EIS combined with the report shallfollow the format in 40 CFR 1502.10, follow the main report, use coloredpaper and not be an attachment or appendix. An EIS integrated within thereport may follow the instructions in the last paragraph of 40 CFR 1502.10.Additional guidance on combining and integrating EISs is located in ER1105-2-60. Where the EIS is not combined with or integrated into the projectdocument, the EIS shall be a separate document and follow the format in40 CFR 1502.10. CEQ regulations suggest maximum lengths for the text ofan EIS at 40 CFR 1502.07. An effort should be exerted to cover the substantivetopics simply and concisely to the extent practicable, and consistent withproducing a legally and technically adequate EIS. Normally, the CEQ pagelimits should be met. (a) <T3>Draft and Final EISs. </T3>Guidance on EISs prepared for planning andcertain planning/engineering studies is contained in ER 1105-2-10 thru60. 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B contains guidance for regulatory actions.For final EISs which are not combined with or integrated into the report,the final EIS may take the form of an ``abbreviated'' document describedin 40 CFR 1503.4(c). An abbreviated final EIS should consist of a new titlepage, summary, errata or correction sheet(s) and comments and responses.In filing the abbreviated final EIS with EPA (Washington Office), fivecopies of the draft EIS shall be included in the transmittal. Districtcommanders shall be responsible for determining the type of final EIS toprepare. (b) <T3>Supplements. </T3>A supplement to the draft or final EIS should beprepared whenever required as discussed in 40 CFR 1502.09(c). A supplementto a draft EIS should be prepared and filed in the same manner as a draftEIS and should be titled ``Supplement I'', ``Supplement II'', etc. Thefinal EIS should address the changes noted in the supplement and substantivecomments received as a result of circulation of the document. A supplementto a final EIS should be prepared and filed first as a <T3>draft </T3>supplement and then as a final supplement. Supplements willbe filed and circulated in the same manner as a draft and final EIS (includingthe abbreviated procedure discussed in 13a. above). Supplements to a draftor final EIS filed before 30 July 1979 may follow the format of the previouslyfiled EIS. Supplements to a draft EIS filed after this date will followthe format outlined in 40 CFR 1502.10. References to the draft or finalEIS being supplemented should be used to eliminate repetitive discussionsin order to focus on the important issues and impacts. The transmittalletter to EPA as well as the cover sheet should clearly identify the titleand purpose of the document as well as the title and filing date of theprevious EIS being supplemented and how copies can be obtained. The decisionmay be made on the proposed action by the appropriate Corps official nosooner than 30 days after the final supplement has been on file. A recordof decision will be signed when the decision is made. (c) <T3>Tiering. </T3>Tiering is discussed in 40 CFR 1502.20 and 1508.28 andshould be used in appropriate cases. The initial broad or programmaticEIS must present sufficient information regarding overall impacts of theproposed action so that the decision-makers can make a reasoned judgmenton the merits of the action at the present stage of planning or developmentand exclude from consideration issues already decided or not ready fordecision. The initial broad EIS should also identify data gaps and discussfuture plans to supplement the data and prepare and circulate site specificEISs or EAs as appropriate. (d) <T3>Other Reports. </T3>District commanders may also publish periodic factsheets and/or other supplemental information documents on long-term orcomplex EISs to keep the public informed on the status of the proposedaction. These documents will not be filed officially with EPA. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Record of decision and implementation. </ITAG>A record of decision shall be prepared by the district commander, in accordancewith 40 CFR 1505.2, for the signature of the final decisionmaker as prescribedby applicable Corps regulations. Procedures implementing the decision arediscussed in 40 CFR 1505.3. Incoming letters of comment on the final EISwill be furnished for review by the decisionmaker who signs the recordof decision. For example, the record of decision for feasibility reportswill be signed by the ASA(CW) at the time the report is transmitted toCongress for authorization. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.15</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Mitigation and monitoring. </ITAG>See 40 CFR 1505.2(c) and 1505.3. District commanders shall, upon requestfrom interested agencies or the public, provide reports on the progressand status of required mitigation and other provisions of their decisionson Corps projects. The term monitoring will be interpreted as that oversightactivity necessary to ensure that the decision, including required mitigationmeasures, is implemented. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.16</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Lead and cooperating agencies. </ITAG>Lead agency, joint lead agency, and cooperating agency designation andresponsibilities are covered in 40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6. The districtcommander is authorized to enter into agreements with regional officesof other agencies as required by 40 CFR 1501.5(c). District or divisioncommanders will consult with HQUSACE (CECW-RE), WASH DC 20314-1000 priorto requesting resolution by CEQ as outlined by 40 CFR 1501.5 (e) and (f).(a) <T3>Lead Agency. </T3>The Corps will normally be lead agency for Corpscivil works projects and will normally avoid joint lead agency arrangements.Lead agency status for regulatory actions will be determined on the basisof 40 CFR 1501.5(c). (b) <T3>Corps as a Cooperating Agency. </T3>For cooperating agency designationthe Corps area of expertise or jurisdiction by law is generally flood control,navigation, hydropower and Corps regulatory responsibilities. See AppendixII of CEQ regulations (49 FR 49750, December 21, 1984). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.17</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Filing requirements. </ITAG>Five copies of draft, final and supplement EISs should be sent to: Director,Office of Federal Activities (A-104), Environmental Protection Agency,401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. District commanders should filedraft EISs and draft supplements directly with EPA. Final EISs and finalsupplements should be filed by appropriate elements within HQUSACE forfeasibility and reevaluation reports requiring Congressional authorization.Division commanders should file final EISs and final supplements for allother Corps actions except for final EISs or final supplements for permitactions which should be filed by the district commander after appropriatereviews by division and the incorporation of division's comments in theEIS. HQUSACE and/or division will notify field office counterparts whento circulate the final EIS or final supplement and will file the finaldocument with EPA after notified that distribution of the document hasbeen accomplished.(a) <T3>Timing Requirements. </T3>Specific timing requirements regarding thefiling of EISs with EPA are discussed in 40 CFR 1506.10. District commanderswill forward any expedited filing requests with appropriate supportinginformation through channels to CECW-RE. Once a decision is reached toprepare an EIS or supplement, district commanders will establish a timeschedule for each step of the process based upon considerations listedin 40 CFR 1501.8 and upon other management considerations. The time requiredfrom the decision to prepare an EIS to filing the final EIS normally shouldnot exceed one year (46 FR 18037, March 23, 1981). For feasibility, continuingauthority, or reevaluation studies, where the project's study time is expectedto exceed 12 months, the timing of the EIS should be commensurate withthe study time. In appropriate circumstances where the costs of completingstudies or acquiring information for an EIS (i.e., cost in terms of money,time, or other resources) would be exorbitant, the district commander shouldconsider using the mechanism described in 40 CFR 1502.22, as amended. Inall cases, however, it is the district commander's responsibility to assurethat the time-limit established for the preparation of an EIS or supplementis consistent with the purposes of NEPA. (b) <T3>Timing Requirements on Supplements. </T3>Minimum review periods willbe observed for draft and final supplements covering actions not havinga bearing on the overall project for which a final EIS has been filed.Such supplements should not curtail other ongoing or scheduled actionson the overall project which have already complied with the proceduralrequirements of NEPA. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.18</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Availability. </ITAG>Draft and final EISs and supplements will be available to the public asprovided in 40 CFR 1502.19 and 1506.6. A summary may be circulated in lieuof the EIS, as provided in 40 CFR 1502.19, if the statement is unusuallylong. These documents will normally be made available without charge exceptthat, in unusual circumstances, reproduction costs may be recovered inaccordance with 40 CFR 1506.6(f) from recipients other than those requiredby CEQ to receive the complete EIS. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.19</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Comments. </ITAG>District commanders shall request comments as set forth in 40 CFR 1503and 1506.6. A lack of response may be presumed to indicate that the partyhas no comment to make. (a) <T3>Time Extensions. </T3>District commanders will consider and act onrequests for time extensions to review and comment on an EIS based on timelinessof distribution of the document, prior agency involvement in the proposedaction, and the action's scope and complexity.(b) <T3>Public Meetings and Hearings. </T3>See 40 CFR 1506.6(c). Refer to paragraph12, 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B for regulatory actions. (c) <T3>Comments Received on the Draft EIS. </T3>See 40 CFR 1503.4. Districtcommanders will pay particular attention to the display in the final EISof comments received on the draft EIS. In the case of abbreviated finalEISs, follow 40 CFR 1503.4(c). For all other final EISs, comments and agencyresponses thereto will be placed in an appendix in a format most efficientfor users of the final EIS to understand the nature of public input andthe district commander's consideration thereof. District commanders willavoid lengthy or repetitive verbatim reporting of comments and will keepresponses clear and concise. (d) <T3>Comments Received on the Final EIS. </T3>Responses to comments receivedon the final EIS are required only when substantive issues are raised whichhave not been addressed in the EIS. In the case of feasibility reportswhere the final report and EIS, Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors(CEBRH) or Mississippi River Commission (CEMRC) report, and the proposedChief's report are circulated for review, incoming comment letters willnormally be answered, if appropriate, by CECW-P. After the review periodis over, CECW-P will provide copies of all incoming comments received inHQUSACE to the district commander for use in preparing the draft recordof decision. For all other Corps actions except regulatory actions (See33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B), two copies of all incoming comment letters(even if the letters do not require an agency response) together with thedistrict commander's responses (if appropriate) and the draft record ofdecision will be submitted through channels to the appropriate decisionauthority. In the case of a letter recommending a referral under 40 FRPart 1504, reporting officers will notify CECW-RE and request further guidance.The record of decision will not be signed nor any action taken on the proposaluntil the referral case is resolved. (e) <T3>Commenting on Other Agencies' EISs. </T3>See 40 CFR 1503.2 and 1503.3.District commanders will provide comments directly to the requesting agency.CECW-RE will provide comments about legislation, national program proposals,regulations or other major policy issues to the requesting agency. SeeAppendix III of CEQ regulations. When the Corps is a cooperating agency,the Corps will provide comments on another Federal agency's draft EIS evenif the response is no comment. Comments should be specific and restrictedto areas of Corps jurisdiction by law and special expertise as definedin 40 CFR 1508.15 and 1508.26, generally including flood control, navigation,hydropower, and regulatory responsibilities. See Appendix II of CEQ regulations.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.20</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Integration with State and local procedures. </ITAG>See 40 CFR 1506.2. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.21</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Adoption. </ITAG>See 40 CFR 1506.3. A district commander will normally adopt another Federalagency's EIS and consider it to be adequate unless the district commanderfinds substantial doubt as to technical or procedural adequacy or omissionof factors important to the Corps decision. In such cases, the districtcommander will prepare a draft and final supplement noting in the draftsupplement why the EIS was considered inadequate. In all cases, exceptwhere the document is not recirculated as provided in 40 CFR 1506.3 (b)or (c), the adopted EIS with the supplement, if any, will be processedin accordance with this regulation. A district commander may also adoptanother agency's EA/FONSI. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.22</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Limitations on actions during the NEPA process. </ITAG>See 40 CFR 1506.1. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.23</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Predecision referrals. </ITAG>See 40 CFR Part 1504. If the district commander determines that a predecisionreferral is appropriate, the case will be sent through division to reachCECW-RE not later than 15 days after the final EIS was filed with EPA.Corps actions referred to CEQ by another Federal agency shall be transmittedto CECW-RE for further guidance.

A listing of environmental laws and orders is containedin table 3.4.3 of Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelinesfor Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies. Reviews andconsultation requirements, analyses, and status of coordination associatedwith applicable laws, executive orders and memoranda will be summarizedin the draft document. The results of the coordination completed or underwaypursuant to these authorities will be summarized in the final document.Where the results of the ongoing studies are not expected to materiallyaffect the decision on the proposed action, the filing of the final EISneed not be delayed.

Proceduralrequirements for Civil Works studies and projects are discussed below.(1) The district commander through the division commander will notify CECW-PE,PN, PS or PW as appropriate, of an impending action which may impact onanother country and for which environmental studies may be necessary todetermine the extent and significance of the impact. The district commanderwill inform CECW-P whether entry into the country is necessary to studythe base condition. (2) CECW-P will notify the State Department, Office of Environment andHealth (OES/ENH) of the district commander's concern, and whether a needexists at this point to notify officially the foreign nation of our intentto study potential impacts. Depending on expected extent and severity ofimpacts, or if entry is deemed necessary, the matter will be referred tothe appropriate foreign desk for action. (3) As soon as it becomes evident that the impacts of the proposed actionsare considered significant, CECW-P will notify the State Department. TheState Department will determine whether the foreign embassy needs to benotified, and will do so if deemed appropriate, requesting formal discussionson the matter. When the International Joint Commission (IJC) or the InternationalBoundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico (IBWC) is involvedin a study, the State Department should be consulted to determine the foreignpolicy implications of any action and the proper course of action for formalconsultations. (4) Prior to public dissemination, press releases or reports dealing withimpact assessments in foreign nations should be made available to the appropriateforeign desk at the State Department for clearance and coordination withthe foreign embassy. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 230.26</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General considerations in preparing corps EISs. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Interdisciplinary Preparation. </T3>See (40 CFR 1502.6).

This environmental evaluation shouldbe continued in the feasibility phase, and if the need for an EIS developsthe district commander will issue a notice of intent as early in the feasibilityphase as possible. Following the guidance in ER 1105-2-10 through 60, thedistrict commander will prepare a draft feasibility report combining orintegrating the draft EIS or EA and draft FONSI (as appropriate), or aseparate NEPA document and circulate it to agencies, organizations andmembers of the public known to have an interest in the study. Five copiesof the draft EIS and report will be mailed to Director, Office of FederalActivities (A-104), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW.,Washington, DC 20460 for filing after distribution has been accomplished.After receipt and evaluation of comments received, the district commanderwill prepare the final report and EIS or EA and FONSI and submit it tothe division commander for review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Division Review. </T3>After review, the division commander will issuea public notice of report issuance and transmit the report to the CEBRH.On Mississippi River and Tributaries projects, the district commander willissue a public notice and submit the report to the CEMRC. For the purposeof this regulation, only the acronym CEBRH will be used since the reviewfunctions of CEMRC and CEBRH are similar. The notice will provide a 30-dayperiod for comments to be submitted to CEBRH on the report and EIS. Althoughthe EIS in the report is identified as ``final'' at this stage of processing,it should be made clear to all those requesting a copy that it is an ``InterimDocument under Agency Review_Subject to Revision'' and will become theagency's final EIS when it is filed after CEBRH review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>CEBRH Review. </T3>CEBRH will review the EIS at the same time it reviewsthe final feasibility report.

Specific examples of ways to reduce paperwork in the NEPA processare found at 40 CFR 1500.4. Maximum advantage of these recommendationsshould be taken. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>General. </T3>This Appendix sets forth implementing procedures forthe Corps regulatory program. For additional guidance, see the Corps NEPAregulation 33 CFR Part 230 and for general policy guidance, see the CEQregulations 40 CFR 1500-1508. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Development of Information and Data. </T3>See 40 CFR 1506.5. The districtengineer may require the applicant to furnish appropriate information thatthe district engineer considers necessary for the preparation of an EnvironmentalAssessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). See also 40 CFR1502.22 regarding incomplete or unavailable information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Elimination of Duplication with State and Local Procedures. </T3>See40 CFR 1506.2. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Public Involvement. </T3>Several paragraphs of this appendix (paragraphs7, 8, 11, 13, and 19) provide information on the requirements for districtengineers to make available to the public certain environmental documentsin accordance with 40 CFR 1506.6.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Categorical Exclusions_a. <T3>General. </T3>Even though an EA or EIS is not legally mandated forany Federal action falling within one of the ``categorical exclusions,''that fact does not exempt any Federal action from procedural or substantivecompliance with any other Federal law. For example, compliance with theEndangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, etc., is always mandatory,even for actions not requiring an EA or EIS. The following activities arenot considered to be major Federal actions significantly affecting thequality of the human environment and are therefore categorically excludedfrom NEPA documentation: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Fixed or floating small private piers, small docks, boat hoistsand boathouses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Minor utility distribution and collection lines including irrigation;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Minor maintenance dredging using existing disposal sites; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Boat launching ramps; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) All applications which qualify as letters of permission (as describedat 33 CFR 325.5(b)(2)). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Extraordinary Circumstances. </T3>District engineers should be alertfor extraordinary circumstances where normally excluded actions could havesubstantial environmental effects and thus require an EA or EIS. For aperiod of one year from the effective data of these regulations, districtengineers should maintain an information list on the type and number ofcategorical exclusion actions which, due to extraordinary circumstances,triggered the need for an EA/FONSI or EIS. If a district engineer determinesthat a categorical exclusion should be modified, the information will befurnished to the division engineer who will review and analyze the actionsand circumstances to determine if there is a basis for recommending a modificationto the list of categorical exclusions. HQUSACE (CECW-OR) will review recommendedchanges for Corps-wide consistency and revise the list accordingly. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>EA/FONSI Document. </T3>(See 40 CFR 1508.9 and 1508.13 for definitions)_a.<T3>Environmental Assessment (EA) and Findings of No Significant Impact(FONSI). </T3>The EA should normally be combined with other required documents(EA/404(b)(1)/SOF/FONSI). ``EA'' as used throughout this Appendix normallyrefers to this combined document. The district engineer should completean EA as soon as practicable after all relevant information is available(i.e., after the comment period for the public notice of the permit applicationhas expired) and when the EA is a separate document it must be completedprior to completion of the statement of finding (SOF). When the EA confirmsthat the impact of the applicant's proposal is not significant and thereare no ``unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of availableresources * * *'' (section 102(2)(E) of NEPA), and the proposed activityis a ``water dependent'' activity as defined in 40 CFR 230.10(a)(3), theEA need not include a discussion on alternatives. In all other cases wherethe district engineer determines that there are unresolved conflicts concerningalternative uses of available resources, the EA shall include a discussionof the reasonable alternatives which are to be considered by the ultimatedecision-maker. The decision options available to the Corps, which embraceall of the applicant's alternatives, are issue the permit, issue with modificationsor deny the permit. Modifications are limited to those project modificationswithin the scope of established permit conditioning policy (See 33 CFR325.4). The decision option to deny the permit results in the ``no action''alternative (i.e. no activity requiring a Corps permit). The combined documentnormally should not exceed 15 pages and shall conclude with a FONSI (See40 CFR 1508.13) or a determination that an EIS is required. The districtengineer may delegate the signing of the NEPA document. Should the EA demonstratethat an EIS is necessary, the district engineer shall follow the proceduresoutlined in paragraph 8 of this Appendix. In those cases where it is obviousan EIS is required, an EA is not required. However, the district engineershould document his reasons for requiring an EIS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Scope of Analysis. </T3>(1) In some situations, a permit applicantmay propose to conduct a specific activity requiring a Department of theArmy (DA) permit (e.g., construction of a pier in a navigable water ofthe United States) which is merely one component of a larger project (e.g.,construction of an oil refinery on an upland area). The district engineershould establish the scope of the NEPA document (e.g., the EA or EIS) toaddress the impacts of the specific activity requiring a DA permit andthose portions of the entire project over which the district engineer hassufficient control and responsibility to warrant Federal review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The district engineer is considered to have control and responsibilityfor portions of the project beyond the limits of Corps jurisdiction wherethe Federal involvement is sufficient to turn an essentially private actioninto a Federal action. These are cases where the environmental consequencesof the larger project are essentially products of the Corps permit action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Typical factors to be considered in determining whether sufficient``control and responsibility'' exists include: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Whether or not the regulated activity comprises ``merely a link''in a corridor type project (e.g., a transportation or utility transmissionproject). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Whether there are aspects of the upland facility in the immediatevicinity of the regulated activity which affect the location and configurationof the regulated activity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) The extent to which the entire project will be within Corpsjurisdiction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) The extent of cumulative Federal control and responsibility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Federal control and responsibility will include the portions ofthe project beyond the limits of Corps jurisdiction where the cumulativeFederal involvement of the Corps and other Federal agencies is sufficientto grant legal control over such additional portions of the project. Theseare cases where the environmental consequences of the additional portionsof the projects are essentially products of Federal financing, assistance,direction, regulation, or approval (not including funding assistance solelyin the form of general revenue sharing funds, with no Federal agency controlover the subsequent use of such funds, and not including judicial or administrativecivil or criminal enforcement actions). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. In determining whether sufficient cumulative Federal involvementexists to expand the scope of Federal action the district engineer shouldconsider whether other Federal agencies are required to take Federal actionunder the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C.470 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>), Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, (42 U.S.C.4321 91977), and other environmental review laws and executive orders.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. The district engineer should also refer to paragraphs 8(b) and8(c) of this appendix for guidance on determining whether it should bethe lead or a cooperating agency in these situations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These factors will be added to or modified through guidance as additionalfield experience develops. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Examples: </T3>If a non-Federal oil refinery, electric generating plant,or industrial facility is proposed to be built on an upland site and theonly DA permit requirement relates to a connecting pipeline, supply loadingterminal or fill road, that pipeline, terminal or fill road permit, inand of itself, normally would not constitute sufficient overall Federalinvolvement with the project to justify expanding the scope of a CorpsNEPA document to cover upland portions of the facility beyond the structuresin the immediate vicinity of the regulated activity that would effect thelocation and configuration of the regulated activity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Similarly, if an applicant seeks a DA permit to fill waters or wetlandson which other construction or work is proposed, the control and responsibilityof the Corps, as well as its overall Federal involvement would extend tothe portions of the project to be located on the permitted fill. However,the NEPA review would be extended to the entire project, including portionsoutside waters of the United States, only if sufficient Federal controland responsibility over the entire project is determined to exist; thatis, if the regulated activities, and those activities involving regulation,funding, etc. by other Federal agencies, comprise a substantial portionof the overall project. In any case, once the scope of analysis has beendefined, the NEPA analysis for that action should include direct, indirectand cumulative impacts on all Federal interests within the purview of theNEPA statute. The district engineer should, whenever practicable, incorporateby reference and rely upon the reviews of other Federal and State agencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For those regulated activities that comprise merely a link in a transportationor utility transmission project, the scope of analysis should address theFederal action, i.e., the specific activity requiring a DA permit and anyother portion of the project that is within the control or responsibilityof the Corps of Engineers (or other Federal agencies). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For example, a 50-mile electrical transmission cable crossing a 11/4 mile wide river that is a navigable water of the United States requiresa DA permit. Neither the origin and destination of the cable nor its routeto and from the navigable water, except as the route applies to the locationand configuration of the crossing, are within the control or responsibilityof the Corps of Engineers. Those matters would not be included in the scopeof analysis which, in this case, would address the impacts of the specificcable crossing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Conversely, for those activities that require a DA permit for a majorportion of a transportation or utility transmission project, so that theCorps permit bears upon the origin and destination as well as the routeof the project outside the Corps regulatory boundaries, the scope of analysisshould include those portions of the project outside the boundaries ofthe Corps section 10/404 regulatory jurisdiction. To use the same example,if 30 miles of the 50-mile transmission line crossed wetlands or other``waters of the United States,'' the scope of analysis should reflect impactsof the whole 50-mile transmission line. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For those activities that require a DA permit for a major portionof a shoreside facility, the scope of analysis should extend to uplandportions of the facility. For example, a shipping terminal normally requiresdredging, wharves, bulkheads, berthing areas and disposal of dredged materialin order to function. Permits for such activities are normally consideredsufficient Federal control and responsibility to warrant extending thescope of analysis to include the upland portions of the facility. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In all cases, the scope of analysis used for analyzing both impactsand alternatives should be the same scope of analysis used for analyzingthe benefits of a proposal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. <T3>Environmental Impact Statement_General_</T3>a. <T3>Determination of Lead and Cooperating Agencies. </T3>When the districtengineer determines that an EIS is required, he will contact all appropriateFederal agencies to determine their respective role(s), i.e., that of leadagency or cooperating agency. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Corps as Lead Agency. </T3>When the Corps is lead agency, it will beresponsible for managing the EIS process, including those portions whichcome under the jurisdiction of other Federal agencies. The district engineeris authorized to require the applicant to furnish appropriate informationas discussed in paragraph 3 of this appendix. It is permissable for theCorps to reimburse, under agreement, staff support from other Federal agenciesbeyond the immediate jurisdiction of those agencies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Corps as Cooperating Agency. </T3>If another agency is the lead agencyas set forth by the CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6(a) and 1508.16),the district engineer will coordinate with that agency as a cooperatingagency under 40 CFR 1501.6(b) and 1508.5 to insure that agency's resultingEIS may be adopted by the Corps for purposes of exercising its regulatoryauthority. As a cooperating agency the Corps will be responsible to thelead agency for providing environmental information which is directly relatedto the regulatory matter involved and which is required for the preparationof an EIS. This in no way shall be construed as lessening the districtengineer's ability to request the applicant to furnish appropriate informationas discussed in paragraph 3 of this appendix. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When the Corps is a cooperating agency because of a regulatory responsibility,the district engineer should, in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.6(b)(4), ``makeavailable staff support at the lead agency's request'' to enhance the latter'sinterdisciplinary capability provided the request pertains to the Corpsregulatory action covered by the EIS, to the extent this is practicable.Beyond this, Corps staff support will generally be made available to thelead agency to the extent practicable within its own responsibility andavailable resources. Any assistance to a lead agency beyond this will normallybe by written agreement with the lead agency providing for the Corps expenseson a cost reimbursable basis. If the district engineer believes a publichearing should be held and another agency is lead agency, the districtengineer should request such a hearing and provide his reasoning for therequest. The district engineer should suggest a joint hearing and offerto take an active part in the hearing and ensure coverage of the Corpsconcerns. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Scope of Analysis. </T3>See paragraph 7b. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. <T3>Scoping Process. </T3>Refer to 40 CFR 1501.7 and 33 CFR 230.12. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. <T3>Contracting. </T3>See 40 CFR 1506.5. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The district engineer may prepare an EIS, or may obtain informationneeded to prepare an EIS, either with his own staff or by contract. Inchoosing a contractor who reports directly to the district engineer, theprocedures of 40 CFR 1506.5(c) will be followed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Information required for an EIS also may be furnished by the applicantor a consultant employed by the applicant. Where this approach is followed,the district engineer will (i) advise the applicant and/or his consultantof the Corps information requirements, and (ii) meet with the applicantand/or his consultant from time to time and provide him with the districtengineer's views regarding adequacy of the data that are being developed(including how the district engineer will view such data in light of anypossible conflicts of interest). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The applicant and/or his consultant may accept or reject the districtengineer's guidance. The district engineer, however, may after specifyingthe information in contention, require the applicant to resubmit any previouslysubmitted data which the district engineer considers inadequate or inaccurate.In all cases, the district engineer should document in the record the Corpsindependent evaluation of the information and its accuracy, as requiredby 40 CFR 1506.5(a). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. <T3>Change in EIS Determination. </T3>If it is determined that an EIS isnot required after a notice of intent has been published, the districtengineer shall terminate the EIS preparation and withdraw the notice ofintent. The district engineer shall notify in writing the appropriate divisionengineer; HQUSACE (CECW-OR); the appropriate EPA regional administrator,the Director, Office of Federal Activities (A-104), EPA, 401 M Street SW.,Washington, DC 20460 and the public of the determination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">h. <T3>Time Limits. </T3>For regulatory actions, the district engineer willfollow 33 CFR 230.17(a) unless unusual delays caused by applicant inactionor compliance with other statutes require longer time frames for EIS preparation.At the outset of the EIS effort, schedule milestones will be developedand made available to the applicant and the public. If the milestone datesare not met the district engineer will notify the applicant and explainthe reason for delay. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. <T3>Organization and Content of Draft EISs_</T3>a. <T3>General. </T3>This section gives detailed information for preparingdraft EISs. When the Corps is the lead agency, this draft EIS format andthese procedures will be followed. When the Corps is one of the joint leadagencies, the joint lead agencies will mutually decide which agency's formatand procedures will be followed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Format_</T3>(1) <T3>Cover Sheet. </T3>(a) Ref. 40 CFR 1502.11. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The ``person at the agency who can supply further information''(40 CFR 1502.11(c) is the project manager handling that permit application.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The cover sheet should identify the EIS as a Corps permit actionand state the authorities (sections 9, 10, 404, 103, etc.) under whichthe Corps is exerting its jurisdiction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Summary. </T3>In addition to the requirements of 40 CFR 1502.12, thissection should identify the proposed action as a Corps permit action statingthe authorities (sections 9, 10, 404, 103, etc.) under which the Corpsis exerting its jurisdiction. It shall also summarize the purpose and needfor the proposed action and shall briefly state the beneficial/adverseimpacts of the proposed action. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Table of Contents. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) <T3>Purpose and Need. </T3>See 40 CFR 1502.13. If the scope of analysisfor the NEPA document (see paragraph 7b) covers only the proposed specificactivity requiring a Department of the Army permit, then the underlyingpurpose and need for that specific activity should be stated. (For example,``The purpose and need for the pipe is to obtain cooling water from theriver for the electric generating plant.'') If the scope of analysis coversa more extensive project, only part of which may require a DA permit, thenthe underlying purpose and need for the entire project should be stated.(For example, ``The purpose and need for the electric generating plantis to provide increased supplies of electricity to the (named) geographicarea.'') Normally, the applicant should be encouraged to provide a statementof his proposed activity's purpose and need from his perspective (for example,``to construct an electric generating plant''). However, whenever the NEPAdocument's scope of analysis renders it appropriate, the Corps also shouldconsider and express that activity's underlying purpose and need from apublic interest perspective (to use that same example, ``to meet the public'sneed for electric energy''). Also, while generally focusing on the applicant'sstatement, the Corps, will in all cases, exercise independent judgmentin defining the purpose and need for the project from both the applicant'sand the public's perspective. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) <T3>Alternatives. </T3>See 40 CFR 1502.14. The Corps is neither an opponentnor a proponent of the applicant's proposal; therefore, the applicant'sfinal proposal will be identified as the ``applicant's preferred alternative''in the final EIS. Decision options available to the district engineer,which embrace all of the applicant's alternatives, are issue the permit,issue with modifications or conditions or deny the permit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Only reasonable alternatives need be considered in detail, asspecified in 40 CFR 1502.14(a). Reasonable alternatives must be those thatare feasible and such feasibility must focus on the accomplishment of theunderlying purpose and need (of the applicant or the public) that wouldbe satisfied by the proposed Federal action (permit issuance). The alternativesanalysis should be thorough enough to use for both the public interestreview and the 404(b)(1) guidelines (40 CFR Part 230) where applicable.Those alternatives that are unavailable to the applicant, whether or notthey require Federal action (permits), should normally be included in theanalysis of the no-Federal-action (denial) alternative. Such alternativesshould be evaluated only to the extent necessary to allow a complete andobjective evaluation of the public interest and a fully informed decisionregarding the permit application. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The ``no-action'' alternative is one which results in no constructionrequiring a Corps permit. It may be brought by (1) the applicant electingto modify his proposal to eliminate work under the jurisdiction of theCorps or (2) by the denial of the permit. District engineers, when evaluatingthis alternative, should discuss, when appropriate, the consequences ofother likely uses of a project site, should the permit be denied. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The EIS should discuss geographic alternatives, e.g., changesin location and other site specific variables, and functional alternatives,e.g., project substitutes and design modifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The Corps shall not prepare a cost-benefit analysis for projectsrequiring a Corps permit. 40 CFR 1502.23 states that the weighing of thevarious alternatives need not be displayed in a cost-benefit analysis and``* * * should not be when there are important qualitative considerations.''The EIS should, however, indicate any cost considerations that are likelyto be relevant to a decision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) Mitigation is defined in 40 CFR 1508.20, and Federal action agenciesare directed in 40 CFR 1502.14 to include appropriate mitigation measures.Guidance on the conditioning of permits to require mitigation is in 33CFR 320.4(r) and 325.4.
