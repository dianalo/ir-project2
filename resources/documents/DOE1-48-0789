We have wound six magnets withhome-made Nb-Ti multifilamental wire using a new art which is developedin our institute. The highlights of the art lie in brushing wax addingAl{sub 2}O{sub 3} with high heat conductivity and/or Gd{sub 2}O{sub 3}powders with high heat capacity at low temperature. The centrical fieldsproduced by these magnets are all higher than 8.5 T, and one of themhas set a home record of 9.24 T. All the quench currents have gone beyond95% I/sub c/ of short samples onload lines without any training behavior.</TEXT></DOC>
