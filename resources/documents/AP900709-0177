On the one hand, people remember their own forebears. They reactto the words on the base of the Statue of Liberty.   On the other hand, the new immigrant is often resented. When theIrish were pouring into America by the tens of thousands to avoidfamine, public sentiment was against Irish immigration.   When Italians arrived by the boatload to provide the laborsupply that transformed the country from an agricultural societyinto an industrialized society, sentiment was anti-Italian.   When the Chinese settled in San Francisco and became famous forthe laundries they operated, their non-Chinese competitorspersuaded the state legislature to require that laundries be builtof brick. Somehow, the only launderers prosecuted for working outof wooden buildings were Chinese.   There's always been at work a last-one-off-the-boat,pull-up-the-ladder syndrome.   Organized labor, normally on the liberal side of issues,frequently opposes liberalized immigration. It suspects immigrantswill take jobs and take lower wages.   Old Guard conservatives also often want to restrict immigration.They fear that the Western European heritage that is the foundationof the Constitution and the culture will be worn away under wavesof today's newcomers, many dark-skinned and from the Third World,who know nothing of the Bible, the Magna Carta, checks and balances.   Yet humanitarian instincts exert their own tug. The land ofopportunity over the decades has sheltered those yearning to befree.   Exerting the tug these days are Russian Jews and EasternEuropeans who waited for years for the opportunity to leave andrisked much by applying to go; Vietnamese who jeopardized theirlives to flee home in dangerous boats; Afghans who fought in a warsupported by the United States.   Let them in, argues a conservative economist, Stephen Moore, whosaid he bases his appeal not on any squishy sentimentality but onself-serving pragmatism.   ``I see it not that we're doing good for them but that they dogood for us,'' he said.   Moore, formerly with the Heritage Foundation, is executivedirector of the American Immigration Institute, newly founded tocampaign for increased immigration. Its co-chairmen are aconservative, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., who was born in Berlin,and a liberal, Mayor Raymond Flynn of Boston.   ``If America's going to continue to be a first-class economicpower, we've got to be able to compete,'' Moore said in aninterview. ``If an immigrant works 18 hours a day, that's notsomething to be held against him, that's what capitalism is allabout: work hard and you'll get ahead.''   He said the United States now admits about three immigrants per1,000 residents. At the turn if the century it was 15 per 1,000.His group wants to return to 15.   At the same time, as a conservative, Moore opposes the $5,000per person given refugees (but not immigrants) resettling in theUnited States as a safety net. He said it implants a welfarementality, starts the newcomers off looking for handouts.   ``Refugees locating in California have four times as high adependency rate and only half the labor force participation rate asdo those in Texas, where benefits are less than half as generous,''he said in an essay in Policy Review, published by the HeritageFoundation. He would substitute low-interest loans.   U.S. law distinguishes between immigrants and refugees andbetween economic refugees and political refugees, those who have``a well-founded fear of persecution'' if they were returned totheir former country of residence.   Currently, the United States admits about 600,000 people a year,of whom about 100,000 are political refugees. It is sometimesestimated that illegal immigration brings the annual total to 1million.   Moore argues that the distinction between political and economicrefugees no longer makes sense. The policy, he said, translates to:``We will not let you die at the hands of the executioner, but areambivalent to your death from economic deprivation.''   He cites what happened 10 years ago. In what became known as theMariel boat lift, thousands of Cubans, let loose by Fidel Castro asa safety valve for his island's faltering economy, traveling intiny boats, arrived in Florida. Ultimately, they numbered about120,000.   Americans looked askance. In a poll, 91 percent said allimmigration to the United States should be halted until thenational unemployment rate, then 7 percent, fell to 5 percent.   Much was made of the psychotics and the criminals Castro sentalong with economic immigrants.   ``But if you look at the vast majority who came, they haveassimilated extraordinarily well in the Miami economy, whichthroughout the 1980s flourished,'' said Moore. Miami Mayor XavierSuarez called the boat lift the greatest rescue mission sinceNormandy.   Moore said a study done at Princeton University found that eightyears after the Mariel outpouring other minority groups had notsuffered from the infusion of low-skilled workers.   ``If 100,000 Cubans could assimilate in a very short time in onelabor market, the idea of bringing in more than 600,000 into thenational economy shouldn't frighten us,'' he said.   ``Immigrants have a very high rate of entrepreneurship,'' hesaid. ``We see this in the refugee groups _ the Koreans, theVietnamese, the Afghans. It is very common to see Afghans owningconvenience stores, parking lots, taxicab franchises. They're notonly starting businesses, they're often hiring American workers.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs Tue July 10</NOTE></DOC>
