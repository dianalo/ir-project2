Northwest loggers, upset with an upcoming program on the region'sancient forests, began a loosely organized campaign threatening toboycott the brewery's products unless Stroh dropped its support forthe specials.   Environmental sources, who asked to remain anonymous, had earliersaid that Stroh requested that changes be made in the program,``Ancient Forests: Rage Over Trees,'' and when the Audubon Societyrefused the company decided to drop its $600,000 in underwriting.   The timber industry and environmentalists have been locked in abitter struggle for months over future logging in the Northwest'sold-growth forests, which provide prime habitat for the northernspotted owl.   The Audubon Society is among environmental groups that havesought to have the owl protected and logging in the ancient forestshalted. Audubon officials insist that the special, which will beshown on cable television Sept. 24 and on public television later,is ``fair and balanced.''   Stroh has provided about half the funding for the four-showseries with the balance coming from Turner Broadcasting System.   Turner spokeswoman Kirsten White said Wednesday that her companyhad no plans to drop the show.</TEXT><NOTE>Government Could Not Handle Major Spill, Experts Say</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Budget cuts are hampering the government'sability to prevent major Great Lakes oil spills and to minimize thedamage if they occur, experts say.   The oil industry, meanwhile, underestimates the threat to thelakes as it prepares to open emergency response centers along thenation's sea coasts but none on lake shores, witnesses told theGovernmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of governmentmanagement.   The panel, chaired by Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., is investigatingthe dangers posed by spills into the lakes in the wake of the March24 Exxon Valdez disaster off the Alaskan coast.   At a hearing Wednesday, speakers said the ramifications of acomparable spill on the lakes would be economically devastating.   ``The Great Lakes are far more vulnerable to spills than mostpeople realize, and there are far more inadequacies in our spillresponse and prevention capabilities than we can or shouldtolerate,'' Levin said.   None of the five emergency response centers envisioned by the oilindustry is close enough to contain a major spill on the lakes, saidDavid F. Hales, director of the Michigan Department of NaturalResources.   In a written statement, the American Petroleum Institute said itsNew York response office would handle Great Lakes spills.   ``Equipment from the ... center could be rapidly airlifted to anyGreat Lakes port,'' the statement said.   The U.S. and Canadian coast guards reported 492 oil and chemicalspills into the lakes in 1988. There were 384 reported spills in1987 and 401 in 1986.</TEXT><NOTE>Obermaier Doesn't Anticipate Confirmation Problems</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Otto G.
