<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-40-0415 </DOCNO><TEXT>A description of the computer program LOCAS is given. LOCAS was developedat the Hanford site to assist in evaluating what areas in a facilityare covered by the gamma-sensitive criticality detectors for variousalarm trip settings. Detectors may be grouped into ``2 of n'' sets, andthere may be multiple sets. Representations of facility walls are storedin a wall library file, and detector coordinates may also be stored ina library file. Program output consists of numerical tables of dose ratesand/or printhead graphics with print characters representing dose ratesin a user-defined search plane. The primary limitations of the code are:the assumed photon spectrum is that of prompt gammas from fission, withoutincluding the effect of neutron interactions, which tend to produce higherenergy photons, and limited inclusion of photon scattering through theuse of dose buildup factors. For the purpose of evaluating the areascovered by a detector set, these limitations are conservative, i.e.,they tend to underestimate the areas covered by the detection system.5 refs., 2 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
