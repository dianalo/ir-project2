Under a proposed rule, the minimum sizerequirements for grapefruit were to be tightened by prohibiting the shipmentof any grapefruit smaller than pack size 96 during the period November16 through January 31 each season, starting in 1988. However, a one yeardelay in the effective date reflects current crop and marketing conditionswhich make implementation this year impractical. When implemented, thechange is expected to provide more desirable sizes with more acceptablematurity and flavor during the peak demand period of the shipping season.The change is needed by the Texas grapefruit industry to help it more successfullymarket its crop.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>November 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Gary D.

The agreement and order are effective underthe Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C.601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule undercriteria contained therein.Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has consideredthe economic impact of this action on small entities.The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately 78 handlers of Texas oranges and grapefruit subjectto regulation under the Texas citrus marketing order, and approximately2,500 orange and grapefruit producers in Texas. The increase in the numberof handlers and the decrease in the number of producers in this final rulefrom that indicated in the proposed rule reflects more recent industryinformation. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the SmallBusiness Administration (13 CFR 121.2) as those having annual gross revenuesfor the last three years of less than $500,000, and small agriculturalservice firms are defined as those whose gross annual receipts are lessthan $3,500,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classifiedas small entities.The Texas Valley Citrus Committee (TVCC), which administers the order locally,unanimously recommended at its meeting on June 29, 1988, that any grapefruitsmaller than pack size 96 (3\9/16\ inches in diameter) should be prohibitedfrom being shipped to fresh markets during the November 16 through January31, period each season starting with the 1988-89 season. A proposed ruleregarding this recommendation was issued September 26, 1988, and publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 38295, September 30, 1988). The proposedrule provided that interested persons could file public comments throughOctober 17, 1988. No comments were received.On November 10, 1988, the TVCC met again and unanimously recommended thatimplementation of the tighter minimum size requirements be delayed untilthe 1989-90 season. The TVCC now reports that the crop and marketing situationconfronting the Texas grapefruit industry has changed considerably sinceits June meeting. The Texas grapefruit sizes are unusually small this seasonand the juice and products markets are extremely weak because there aremore than enough supplies to meet needs in those markets. Hence, tighteningthe minimum size requirements at this time would require handlers to directadditional supplies of small grapefruit to the already oversupplied juiceand products markets.Allowing the use of smaller size 112's in fresh markets this entire seasonwill provide handlers and growers in the production area the opportunityof obtaining greater returns. Although the fruit in Texas in usually small,it has already reached an acceptable level of maturity and flavor.The TVCC believes that by next season growing and marketing conditionswill have returned to normal, and thus, the tighter requirements shouldbecome effective during the November 16 through January 31 period duringthe 1989-90 season and each season thereafter.Minimum size requirements for Texas grapefruit are currently specifiedin andSection; 906.365. The current regulation provides that grapefruit infresh shipments be at least pack size 96 (3\9/16\ inches in diameter),except that grapefruit grading at least U.S. No. 1 may be shipped if itis at least pack size 112 (3\5/16\ inches in diameter). These requirementsare in effect on a continuous basis from season to season unless changed.The Texas grapefruit shipping season extends from late September throughMay. The temporary prohibition of shipments to size 112's starting nextNovember 16 is intended to provide more desirable sizes with more acceptablematurity and flavor during the peak demand period. According to the TVCC,more than enough larger-size fruit are usually available during this periodto meet market needs. The TVCC also indicated that this action will providegrowers with an incentive to hold the smaller-sized fruit on the treeslonger to gain size, maturity, and flavor and to provide the trade witha more acceptable product later in the season when available supplies arediminishing.Delaying the implementation of the size increase until mid-November willlessen the chances of any grower hardship by allowing the shipment of size112's until juice plants open. There is no viable economic outlet for small-sizesand cull citrus in the production area other than for juice and products.Reinstituting the shipment of size 122's after January 31 would ensurethat there are adequate supplies of flavorful fruit available for freshmarket needs for the remainder of the season.In addition, miscellaneous changes to andSection; 906.365 are made to removeobsolete language and update references to the U.S. Standards For Gradesof Oranges and Grapefruit (Texas and States other than Florida, Californiaand Arizona (7 CFR 51.680 through 51.714, and 7 CFR 51.620 through 51.653respectively). The proposed  rule  inadvertently  specified 2\9/16\ inchesas the minimum size requirement for pack size 288. The size should havebeen 2-6/16 inches in diameter. Section 906.365(a)(2) is changed from theproposal to correctly state a 2-6/16 inch minimum size requirement.Section 906.365 is issued on a continuing basis subject to modification,suspension, or termination by the Secretary. The TVCC meets prior to andduring each season to consider recommendations for modification, suspension,or termination of the regulatory requirements for Texas grapefruit. TVCCmeetings are open to the public and interested persons may express theirviews at these meetings. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (Department)reviews TVCC recommendations and other information submitted by the TVCCand other available information, and determines whether modification, suspension,or termination of the regulatory requirements will tend to effectuate thedeclared policy of the Act.Texas grapefruit shipments to markets in the United States, Canada, andMexico are regulated under this marketing order. Certain shipments areexempt from the handling requirements effective under the marketing order.Handlers may ship grapefruit within the production area (the counties ofCameron, Hidalgo, and Willacy) exempt from all marketing order requirements.Grapefruit shipped in gift packages of not more than 500 pounds which areindividually addressed and not for resale are exempt from handling requirements.Also, grapefruit shipped under the minimum quantity exemption provisions,and for relief, charity, and home use are exempt under certain conditions.In addition, grapefruit shipped to approved processors for conversion intocanned or frozen products are not subject to the handling requirements.These tighter minimum size requirements for Texas grapefruit reflect theTVCC's and the Department's appraisal of the need to issue the rule. Delayingimplementation of this rule until the 1989-90 season recognizes currentand prospective supply and demand conditions for grapefruit and the TVCC'sviews of what is needed to strengthen the marketing position of Texas grapefruitgrowers and handlers.Therefore, the Department's view is that the impact of this action willbe beneficial to producers and handlers because it will enable handlersto better provide grapefruit consistent with buyer requirements. The applicationof minimum size requirements to Texas grapefruit over the past severalyears has resulted in fruit of acceptable sizes being shipped to freshmarkets.Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that thisaction will not be have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information andrecommendations submitted by the committee, and other available information,it is found that the rule as hereinafter set forth will tend to effectuatethe declared policy of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 906</ITAG>Marketing agreements and orders, Texas, Grapefruit, Oranges.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 906 is amended asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 906_ORANGES AND GRAPEFRUIT GROWN IN THE LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEYIN TEXAS</ITAG>1.
