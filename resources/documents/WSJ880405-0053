The No. 3 U.S. auto maker hasn't announced how much individual executives will receive in bonuses and stock options for 1987. Chrysler's offices were closed yesterday; company officials contacted at home said they didn't know how many executives will be eligible for bonuses.    Chrysler's earnings dropped 7% to $1.29 billion in 1987 from $1.39 billion in 1986. But 1986 earnings were inflated by a $131.9 million one-time gain from the sale of its stake in Peugeot S.A. of France. Without the Peugeot gain, Chrysler's 1987 earnings would have been 2.6% ahead of the previous year.    The size of Chrysler's executive &quot;incentive compensation&quot; fund is set according to a formula based on the company's earnings, and is charged against earnings, according to the company's annual report. </TEXT></DOC>
