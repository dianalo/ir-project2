The new federal estimate, 228,621, was immediatelydescribed as too low by academics, government officials,homeless advocates -- and even the Census Bureau itself.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I don't think this reflects the real magnitude of thehomeless population,&quot; said Sar Levitan, a professor at GeorgeWashington University here.   In the 1990 survey, released Friday, 178,828 people werefound in emergency shelters and 49,793 were found on thestreets. Other estimates of the homeless population havevaried from 250,000 to several million.   The best-respected previous estimate, released in 1989 bythe Urban Institute, put the homeless population at 600,000.Even that calculation, though, is considered somewhatspeculative, and has been attacked by advocates of thehomeless.   Cynthia Taeuber, a Census Bureau spokeswoman, said theCensus count wasn't intended to fix definitively the size ofthe homeless population. &quot;It's not a total count of thehomeless,&quot; she said.   But Maria Foscarinis, director of the National Law Centeron Homelessness and Poverty, said the Census numbers could beused to reduce government funding for the homeless. She citeda recent housing law that requires state and localgovernments seeking federal funds for the homeless to submitstatistical information, based in part on Census data,demonstrating their need.   &quot;To the extent that we want them to use the bestinformation they have, sure, we want them to look at Censusdata,&quot; said Anna Kondratas, an assistant secretary at theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development who overseeshomeless programs. Ms. Kondratas said the Census figureprobably was an undercount, but she emphasized that federalspending for the homeless, currently $800 million, isunlikely to be affected.   The Census estimate is the result of a survey conductedlast year during the night of March 20-21. Census enumeratorscounted homeless individuals in shelters and on the streets.Afterward, they tracked down additional homeless people inother shelters.   The Census Bureau's methods in conducting the survey havebeen widely criticized. Among other shortcomings, accordingto homeless advocates and scholars, the survey was largelylimited to cities with populations of more than 50,000;enumerators weren't encouraged to venture into dangerousareas, such as abandoned buildings and subway tunnels, wherehomeless people often seek shelter; and the survey didn'tinclude many people often characterized as homeless byadvocates, such as drug or alcohol abusers living in halfwayhouses and agricultural workers living in dormitories. TheCensus Bureau acknowledged all of these limitations in astatement released with the figures on Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
