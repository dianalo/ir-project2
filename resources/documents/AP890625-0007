In places along the coast, tides were running 2 to 3 feet abovenormal with 6- to 8-foot waves, officials said.   If the storm strengthened, it could become Tropical Storm Allison.   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the depression's poorly defined center wasnear latitude 27.5 degrees north, longitude 96.2 degrees west, orabout 70 miles south of Matagorda, Texas, said meteorologists at theNational Hurricane Center in Miami. It appeared to be stalled,meteorologists said.   The depression's top sustained wind was estimated at 35 mph, withhigher gusts in heavy rain areas north and east of the center.   A tropical storm watch was posted for an area stretching fromBaffin Bay, Texas, to Morgan City, La., advising coastal residentsthat a tropical storm or incipient tropical storm conditions maypose a threat. If the sustained wind hits 39 mph, the depressionwould become a tropical storm.   The Galveston County beach patrol banned swimming in the choppysurf.   ``It's got the gulf kicked up pretty nasty out there right now,''beach patrol director Vic Maceo said. ``We're trying to keep all theinexperienced surfers out of the water.''   The National Weather Service also extended a coastal floodwarning Sunday for Matagorda and Brazoria counties south of Houston.   ``We have had some minor flooding in Bay City proper, but it'sonly been on a few secondary streets,'' said Craig Sharp, spokesmanfor the Matagorda County Sheriff's Department.   ``The ground is saturated and, of course, if we get a lot morerain we expect the situation to deteriorate,'' Sharp said.``Fortunately, so far, the rainfall has been coming in small bandsand the water is still having a chance to run off at this time.''   The Matagorda area received about 10 inches of rain Saturday,officials said.   ``We don't have any reports of flooding yet, but the water's uphigh and there's no beach right now,'' said Brazoria CountySheriff's Department dispatcher Donna Fillmore.</TEXT></DOC>
