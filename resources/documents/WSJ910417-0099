Chrysler Corp., Highland Park, Mich., said a strike wouldshut down the auto industry quickly, because auto makers relyon the delivery of parts shipped as close to assembly aspossible.</LP><TEXT>   A Chrysler spokesman said &quot;a rail strike of any lengthcould result in massive closings. Our industry is alreadyfacing tough times, and this would be another blow whichwould slow our recovery.&quot;   Many freight shippers have been stockpiling raw materialsduring the past week so they could continue operating for awhile even if the trains aren't. Others have moved their mosttime-sensitive shipments to trucks, at rates about 30% higherthan rail. Most don't expect to be hurt severely unless thestrike lasted more than two or three days.   &quot;We can get through a two or three day strike, and canprobably last a little longer,&quot; said Richard A. Roch, vicepresident, logistics, at IMC Fertilizer Group Inc., NorthBrook, Ill. He said the company has moved a significantamount of fertilizer ingredients to dealers and storagefacilities close to customers &quot;so if a strike develops wewould have more ability to deliver by truck.&quot; Nevertheless,he said a rail strike &quot;is coming at a very bad time for theagricultural community.&quot;   But many shippers dependent on rail said they would expectplant closings and layoffs if a strike went on longer than afew days. A rail strike would &quot;basically shut our plantsdown,&quot; says a spokeswoman for American Maize-Products Co.,Stamford, Conn. She said none of the company's plants is setup to load and unload trucks efficiently. The spokeswomanadded that American Maize-Products doesn't have its ownemergency plan. &quot;We're banking on the government to step in,&quot;she said.   Likewise, a prolonged strike would force Georgia-PacificCorp. to delay shipments, or transfer some freight to trucks.But a spokeswoman for the forest products company said there&quot;aren't enough trucks in the country for everyone to dothat.&quot;   Electric utilities have stockpiled coal in recent weeks,so a rail strike isn't likely to disrupt them. For example,Illinois Power Co. estimates it could weather a rail strikefor at least 45 days at any of its five coal-fired generatingplants.   Corning Inc.'s Erwin, N.Y., plant, which makes ceramiccores for catalytic converters used in automobiles, protecteditself by stockpiling three weeks of raw materials, includingclay from Georgia and talc from Montana. Satish Duggal, thecompany's materials control manager, said that a prolongedstrike would shut down its customers, the auto makers, longbefore the Erwin plant ran out of raw materials.   The trend among manufacturers toward lean inventory levelsdependent on timely delivery of freight would leave them morevulnerable to a rail strike. On the other hand, many shippershave been shying away from the rail mode, preferring theflexibility and speed of trucks.   &quot;Anybody with time-specific constraints can't use railanymore,&quot; says Jack McRae, a spokesman for Seattle-basedPACCAR Inc., manufacturer of Peterbilt and Kenworthheavy-duty trucks.   But even shippers who don't use rail might feel theeffects of a rail strike. National Biological Corp., a smallmanufacturer near Cleveland that makes sun lamps for thetreatment of psoriasis, expects trucking service to be inshort supply if a rail strike occurs. &quot;We'll have no choicebut to ship differently,&quot; said Howard J. Drechsler,president, who expects to rely more on air freight to moveproduct at 30% to 40% higher rates than truck rates.   Ocean port officials fear that import containers couldquickly pile up, congesting terminals at the docks, if trainservice is interrupted. &quot;We pray it doesn't happen,&quot; said TomKornegay, managing director of the port of Houston, addingthat 28% of the cargo unloaded from ships at the port aretransferred to rail.   American President Cos., an Oakland, Calif., containership operator, said some Asian exporters have alreadyswitched cargo to all-water carriers to the East Coast inanticipation of a rail strike. American President uses acombination of ship across the Pacific Ocean and rail acrossthe U.S. to deliver freight to the East Coast.
