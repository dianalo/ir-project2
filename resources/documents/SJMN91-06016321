An economical meal, soup in days gone by was an integral partof each day's menu. It wasn't long ago that a stock pot simmered on the backof most stoves ready to accept tasty bones, meat scraps and left-overvegetables.;    Every so often my academic curiosity gets the better of mewhen I am cooking and I run to my dictionary or encyclopedia before lookingthrough my cookbook library when researching recipes. To my surprise, when Ilooked up &quot;soup&quot; in my Merriam-Webster's, I found that its etymology givesinsights into the way our eating habits have evolved.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Weekly, Part 2  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  YOU CAN'T BEAT SOUP IN WINTERIT WARMS UP EVEN THE COLDEST DAY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Weekly Cook  </MEMO><TEXT>     Apparently, the word &quot;soup&quot; evolved from the Germanic, &quot;sop.&quot; &quot;Sop&quot; wasoriginally a bread over which a broth or other liquid was poured.;    Thememory of soup as a main meal lingers on in America when we announce, &quot;Soupson,&quot; to let our family know that the meal is ready.;    For many of us, soupis the ultimate comfort food. My friend, Trent, always prepares tomato soupenriched with milk when he wants to feel homey. He then creates his ownupdated version of an old English soup by dipping tuna sandwiches in thesoup.;    Those tomato-soup saturated sandwiches, &quot;like Mom used to make,&quot; areTrent's favorite &quot;pick me up.&quot;;    I, on the other hand, enjoy making hugekettles of vegetable and bean soup that thicken while they simmer all day onthe stove.;    Occasionally, throughout the day I will step over to the stove,stir, taste, adjust the seasonings and anticipate happily feeding a nourishingdish to my family. By evening, the intoxicating aroma that pervades the entirehouse leaves no stragglers when I finally call, &quot;Soup's on!&quot;;    Here are acouple of my favorite soup recipes. I cook in quantity so I can freeze thesoup in smaller portions for future meals.;     SPLIT PEA AND LENTIL SOUP;  Some brands of dried legumes require soaking. Some don't. Check the directionson the package before you start cooking.;  1 cup split peas;  1/2 cup redlentils;  1/2 cup brown lentils;  1 bag frozen petite peas;  10 cups water;  1large chopped onion;  1 cup chopped celery;  1-2 large cloves garlic, pressedor finely chopped;  1 lean ham bone, (optional);  1 medium grated carrot;  1-2large potatoes, chopped into bite sized pieces;  1/8 teaspoon freshly gratednutmeg;   freshly ground black pepper and salt to taste;  Place split peas andlentils in a strainer. Rinse under cold water and remove any stones. Followdirections on the package if soaking is required. Drain the peas and lentils,reserving the soaking water. Add enough water to the reserved liquid to make10 cups and pour into a large stock pot. Add the drained peas and lentils, thefrozen peas and all of the remaining ingredients except the salt and pepper.Bring the liquid to a boil, then turn down the flame so the soup simmers,bubbling gently just beneath the surface. Simmer covered for 3-4 hours,stirring occasionally. Be aware that if the flame is too high, peas andlentils tend to burn on to the bottom of the pot. If after three hours thesoup is not thick enough for your taste, simmer it uncovered for the remainderof the cooking time. When the soup is at the consistency that appeals to you,remove the ham bone.;    To further thicken the soup, process several cups ina blender or food processor and add back to the stock pot. Serve and enjoy.; CHA-CHA BLACK BEAN AND BEEF SOUP;  2 cups dried black beans, soaked overnightor a minimum of 4 hours;  3 1/2 cups water;  1 large onion, chopped;  2-3cloves garlic, crushed or finely chopped;  1 teaspoon ground coriander;  1 1/2teaspoon cumin;  1 stalk celery, chopped;  1 medium carrot, chopped;  1/2pound lean stew beef, cut into bite-sized pieces;  2 oranges, peeled, seededand cut into bite-sized pieces;  1/4 teaspoon red pepper;  1/4 teaspoon blackpepper;  1/2 teaspoon lemon juice;  Rinse the beans after they have soaked.Place them in a large stock pot with the water. Add the onion, garlic,coriander, and cumin. In a medium fry pan over medium heat, brown the stewingbeef and drain off the fat thoroughly. Add the beef to the stock pot. Bring toa boil, cover and simmer for 1 hour over low heat.;    Next, add the choppedcelery and carrot. Simmer for an additional 1/2 to 1 hour. Add the remainingingredients when the soup's consistency is to your liking. Cook an additional10 minutes to thoroughly heat the new ingredients and serve. If the soup istoo thick, adjust by adding water to thin. To thicken, puree a cup or two inthe blender or food processor and return it to the stock pot.
