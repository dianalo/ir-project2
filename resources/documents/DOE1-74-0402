In contrast the networkformer of the niobium-rich glasses ( y andgt; 12.5) contains chains of NbO{sub6} octahedra sharing common corners. An intermediate situation seemsto occur for y {similar_to} 12.5 which preserves the Nasicon-type structurewith all oxygen atoms common to NbO{sub 6} and PO{sub 4} groups.</TEXT></DOC>
