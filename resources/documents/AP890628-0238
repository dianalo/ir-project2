McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government's chief economic forecastinggauge plunged 1.2 percent in May, the biggest decline since thestock market crash in late 1987, the Commerce Department reportedtoday.   The decline in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators was thethird in the last four months, as the gauge designed to foretelleconomic activity six to nine months into the future continued toflash strong signals of a significant decline in economic activity.   The 1.2 percent decline was significantly steeper than analystshad been expecting. However, economists generally believe theeconomy can escape a recession this year, although they are lookingfor a major slowing in economic growth accompanied by risingunemployment.   The 1.2 percent drop in May followed a 0.6 percent gain posted inApril. The index had fallen 0.6 percent in March and 0.3 percent inFebruary.   The May decline was the stepest since a 1.8 percent plunge inNovember 1987. That drop reflected the shock to the economy from the508-point plunge in the Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks onOct. 19, 1987.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater attemptged to putthe May report in a positive light, saying: ``The economy is healthyand growing at a slower pace, which means less pressure on inflationand interest rates. We still think that the economy is in very goodshape.''   The April increase had allowed the index to steer clear of thetraditional signal of a forthcoming recession _ three declines in arow. But the May report added to the overall downward trend thisyear that has worried many economists.   Today's index figure reinforced recent government and privateindustry reports that show almost every sector of the economycontracting because of the Federal Reserve Board's efforts to raiseinterest rates to control inflation.   For instance, only two of the 11 forward-looking businessstatistics that make up the composite index _ higher stock pricesand increased building permits _ pointed upward in May.   The others pointed down: a drop in the money supply; lower pricesfor sensitive materials, indicating slower demand; the fourthconsecutive drop in an index measuring consumer confidence; fastervendor deliveries, meaning declining demand; a shorter average workweek; fewer orders for plants and equipment; a decrease inmanufacturers' unfilled orders; higher initial claims for joblessbenefits; and a decrease in manufacturers' unfilled orders.   The various changes left the index at 143.8 percent of its 1982base of 100. So far this year, the index has declined at an annualrate of 2.0 percent, compared with an increase of 4.5 percent forall of 1988.   There have been signs recently the Fed has relaxed its gripslightly, but the effects remain. Some economists fear that, unlessthe central bank eases more, the economy could be pushed into arecession.   ``We're still looking for a soft landing without a recession, butwe're keeping our fingers crossed,'' said David Wyss, seniorfinancial economist at Data Resources Inc., in Lexington, Mass.,said Tuesday.   Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group inBala Cynwyd, Pa., said: ``I still think we'll avoid a recession, butthe data probably is a little weaker than any of us had expected.''   Economist James Annable of First National Bank of Chicago seesthe economy slowing dramatically, but without sliding into arecession.   In advance of today's report, most economic forecasters werepredicting the index would give up its April gain _ if not more.   But they thought the economy, now in its seventh year ofexpansion, would continue to grow, although slightly, this year.   Chimerine described 1989 as a ``transition into a long period offairly slow growth,'' somewhere between 1 percent and 2 percent.   Annable said, ``We will see real economic growth for the rest ofthe year of more than 2 percent.''   Wyss, who predicts a soft economy for the remainder of the year,is looking for ``just over a 1.2 percent growth rate during thesecond half of 1989.''   And the latest monthly survey of 51 top economists conducted bythe Blue Chip Economic Indicators Newsletter put the consensusgrowth forecast this year at 2.7 percent, down significantly fromGross National Product growth of 3.9 percent in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
