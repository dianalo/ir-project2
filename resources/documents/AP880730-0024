We have hadnone of that, zero, since I have been chief the past 12 years,''said Ralph Lopez, deputy of environmental health and healthfacilities for the Los Angeles County Department of Health.   ``The only beach pollution trouble we have is if we have abreakdown in a power system or storm damage,'' he said.   In densely populated California, millions of gallons ofuntreated effluent have spilled into the sea in the past two yearsbecause of equipment failures or rain-caused overflows at treatmentplants.   Such accidents add to the hot debate over waste disposal, butactual beach closures have been rare.   A section of Laguna Beach in Orange County was closed for mostof last week when a pump broke, dumping 36,000 gallons of untreatedliquid waste. It was the latest in a series of spills, includingsome last year from a sewage plant in Mexico that forced theshutdown of miles of San Diego beaches.   Further north, Santa Barbara County contends with tar and oilfrom offshore wells and natural seepage. But recent years have seennothing like the spills of the 1960s that killed hundreds of fishand birds.   ``You can see the oil slick come in, a big long line of blackoil and tar,'' said Mark Bray, a lifeguard supervisor for the state.   Hundreds of miles to the north, heavy rains cause untreatedsewage to spill at Ocean Beach in San Francisco about a dozen timesa year, and signs are posted warning against gathering shellfish,which may have ingested bacteria.   Meanwhile, the shark population is rising because of increasingpopulations of protected sea lions and seals. Several fins havebeen spotted recently, although no attacks were reported.   A more persistent problem in the north is debris washing up _including several barrels of toxic chemicals several years ago _and litter left by visitors.   Scenic Hawaii gets garbage dumped from large fishing boats, butthe islands' isolation and strong sea currents help protect itsbeaches, according to Paul Aki, director of the state HealthDepartment's pollution control branch.   ``Plus we are responsible for our own trash. We don't have aneighboring state that can dump garbage that will wash ashorehere,'' Aki said.   In the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, abandoned fishing nets havetrapped dozens of animals, and other garbage kills fur seals andsea birds, said Brian Boyle, Washington commissioner of publiclands.   ``Sea turtles will eat plastic bags thinking they'rejellyfish,'' he said.   Oregon has problems with discarded plastics and aluminum cans,but has avoided much East Coast-style pollution because garbage isnot dumped offshore and the state's population centers are mostlyinland, said Carolyn Young, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Departmentof Environmental Quality.   ``We do have driftwood washing up from logging operationsoccasionally,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
