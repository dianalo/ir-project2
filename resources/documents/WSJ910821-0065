In the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed15.66 points, or 0.5%, to 2913.69, following Monday's70-point plunge. New York Stock Exchange trading was activeat 184.1 million shares, but less frantic than Monday'snearly 230 million.</LP><TEXT>   Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rebounded 2.96 to379.43, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, a measure ofsmall-stock activity, gained 4.41 to 502.05.   Foreign markets, which were hit even harder Monday by theSoviet Union developments, recovered more strongly. InGermany the Frankfurt 30-stock DAX index, down more than 9%Monday, gained nearly 2% yesterday. Japan's Nikkei Index wasup 1% after a 6% decline Monday.   U.S. Treasury bonds posted modest gains, making up equallyslight declines Monday, and the dollar fell after a sharprise Monday as investors sought a haven from which to assessSoviet developments.   But analysts warned that yesterday's stock-market gainsprobably don't signal a trend. Tension is growing in theSoviet Union and with it uncertainty about how events therewill affect the global economy.   &quot;With some 100 tanks surrounding the Soviet Parliamentbuilding, I think the best you can say is that this was atechnical bounce,&quot; said James Solloway, director of researchat Argus Research in New York. &quot;The gains we saw pale incomparison to the selling Monday.&quot;   Mr. Solloway said he told clients Monday to shift someassets to high-quality bonds from stocks. &quot;This is a time tobe prudent,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't know yet what's going tohappen over the next few days, and in any case this thing isgoing to have long-term repercussions.&quot;   He said that before the weekend coup that toppled MikhailGorbachev, investors around the world were making certainassumptions that helped boost stock prices. One of them wasthat the U.S. and the Soviet Union would increasinglycooperate in keeping peace around the world, he said. U.S.investors were looking for reduced military spending incoming years to help reduce the budget deficit. Now, he said,those assumptions will have to be re-examined in light ofreasserted power by Soviet hardliners.   But other analysts noted that in recent years U.S.investors have become conditioned to buy stocks in the wakeof big sell-offs and to look at crises as buyingopportunities. That view was reflected in a poll taken Mondaynight by Fidelity Investments, the big mutual fund company.Fidelity said about two-thirds of 221 fund holders surveyedviewed Monday's sell-off as a buying opportunity, while only9% saw the decline as a sell signal.   In any event, financial markets showed that they remainsensitive to the ebb and flow of news out of the SovietUnion. With foreign stock markets rebounding from their bigsell-offs, the Dow industrials shot up 23 points at theopening of trading, fueled by computer-directed buy programs.   But after that initial surge, prices began slowly sinking.They fell faster after news reports said Soviet tanks weremoving toward the Russian Parliament building, where adefiant Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Republic,rallied protesters against the coup. Apparent dissensionamong the coup leaders, however, helped prices regain some oftheir lost momentum in the afternoon.   If the crisis in the Soviet Union is having any beneficialeffect, it is in the Treasury bond market, which, along withthe dollar, offers shelter to nervous investors.   Many bond traders think the Soviet coup will help nudgethe Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates yetagain sometime this week. The Fed's policymaking committeemet yesterday in a regular session to assess the state of theU.S. economy. With the economic recovery already appearing tofalter before the Soviet coup, most traders and analystsfigure the Fed will lower interest rates, at least until thepace of economic growth appears to be picking up.   Traders said that while there is little direct linkbetween the U.S. and Soviet economies, the turmoil in theSoviet Union could undermine the already-fragile consumerconfidence in the U.S. Until consumer spending increases,many economists think the economy will either continue tostumble along, or slump once again into recession.                                                                                                          Stock prices rose in active trading. On the Big Board,1,088 stocks advanced and 566 declined.                                                                                                          Bond prices climbed. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bondgained a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 faceamount. The yield on the issue fell to 8.08%.</TEXT></DOC>
