Given these commitments,it is stated, Green Canyon has agreed to propose construction of connectingfacilities and to provide such producers with firm transportation throughthe facilities, once construction is authorized and undertaken.Green Canyon's proposed facilities would enable West Green Canyon reservesto be transported from production platforms to Transcontinental Gas PipeLine Corporation's (Transco) existing Southeast Louisiana Gathering Systemoffshore facilities in South Marsh Island Block 106, offshore Louisiana(SMI 106). Green Canyon states that Transco would provide subsequent transportationto market. Green Canyon further states that it has been advised by Transcothat such downstream transportation would be provided by Transco pursuantto section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act or pursuant to the Order No.436/500 certificate issued to Transco in Docket No. CP88-328-000. Specifically,Green Canyon proposes to construct and operate:andbullet; 25.39 miles of 20-inch pipeline from SMI 174 to SMI 106;andbullet; 26.57 miles of 16-inch diameter pipeline from Green Canyon Block52 (GC 52) to SMI 174; (Block 52 Lateral)andbullet; 4.02 miles of 10.75-inch diameter pipeline from GC 6 to an interconnectwith the Block 52 lateral in Ewing Bank Block 976 (EB 976);andbullet; 10.22 miles of 16-inch diameter pipeline from SMI 205 to SMI 174;andandbullet; Meter and regulating stations and appurtenant facilities at SMI174, SMI 205, GC 52, C 6 and SMI 106.It is indicated that the capacity of the proposed facilities would be approximately219,671 Mcf per day and that the project would cost an estimated $48,785,501.Green Canyon states that the proposed project would be financed initiallywith short-term loans and corporate funds, with long-term financing tobe arranged later as part of Green Canyon's permanent financial structure.Green Canyon proposes one-part firm and interruptible transportation ratesover the projected economic life of the project using a levelized costof service, as more fully explained in Exhibit P of the application. GreenCanyon asserts that its proposed transportation rates have been designedon a 100 percent load factor throughout, thus placing Green Canyon's abilityto earn its allowed rate of return at risk unless Green Canyon operatesits facilities at maximum capacity. Given its proposed rate design andits assumption of risk, Green Canyon asserts that it should not be subjectedto any rate review condition.Green Canyon states that firm capacity in its pipeline not already committedto producers with contractual commitments will be made available to potentialshippers pursuant to an ``open season'' which would commence on the effectivedate of an order granting the authorizations requested herein and wouldend 21 days from such date. It is stated that all parties would be treatedequally, with capacity allocated among the parties, if necessary on a prorata basis. Green Canyon further states that interruptible transportationwould initially be made available during the same ``open season'' period,with allocation of capacity to be made, if necessary, on a pro rata basis.Green Canyon explains that after the ``open season'' period, both firmand interruptible capacity would be made available on a first-come, firstserved-basis.<T3>Comment date: </T3>January 31, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of the notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">16.
