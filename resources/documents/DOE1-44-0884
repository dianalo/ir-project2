A comparison of the analyses withthe results of geophysical borehole measurements (density and naturalgamma radiation) revealed only partial quantitative agreement which necessarilyrestricted the information on dirt content in the coal bands. The sondereporting function was calculated from the log with the assistance ofdigital noise filters and deconvolution (unfolding) processes so as toprovide the necessary conditions for compensating the effects of themeasuring system itself and in this way improving the range and reliabilityof the information provided by the borehole measurement. 15 refs., 6figs.</TEXT></DOC>
