The Dona Marilyn sank Monday with more than 500 people aboard.   The discovery of survivors on remote islands lifted the hopes ofrescue workers, who have found the bodies of at least 32 people.Other reports put the death toll at 26.   Carlos Go, president of the shipping company that owned the DonaMarilyn, said 138 of the survivors had been put aboard anothercompany vessel and were expected to arrive in Tacloban Thursday.   Others remained on small islands near where the 2,855-ton DonaMarilyn sank. The vessel was on a Manila-Tacloban run when it sankin heavy seas and high winds about 300 miles southeast of thecapital.   Go said he hoped more survivors would be found.   ``There are plenty of islands in the area,'' and the search wascontinuing Thursday, he said.   Survivors told how people rushed into lifeboats or divedoverboard as the vessel heaved in storm-whipped seas and sank.   In Manila, people jammed the offices of Sulpicio Lines, whichowned the ship, seeking information about relatives who were aboard.   Virginia Tamban, whose sister and two nieces were passengers,said she would remain overnight to see if their names appeared onthe list of survivors. ``I hope they are safe,'' she sobbed. Shesaid none of them knew how to swim.   Raymundo Adejer, 27, said his sister, Natividad, and her4-year-old son were on the vessel, although the boy's name was noton the manifest.   ``I cannot blame anyone for this except the captain of the shipwho still sailed despite reports that a storm was coming up,''Adejer said.   President Corazon Aquino on Wednesday declared a state ofcalamity in Manila and 35 provinces hardest hit by Typhoon Ruby.   The Red Cross and other relief agencies said 114 people werekilled on land by the typhoon, which pummeled the entire archipelagonation with heavy rains and winds Monday and Tuesday before headingwest toward China.   The Red Cross said more than 765,000 Filipinos were affected byRuby, meaning their homes were destroyed, damaged or flooded orsustained other losses. The government said the storm caused $45million in damage to crops and destroyed $7.5 million worth of roadsand bridges.   Bernardo Cabigon, Sulpicio's station manager in Tacloban, quotedsurviving crewmembers of the Dona Marilyn as saying they brieflytried to pump water from the ship as it listed to one side.   ``After they found out they could not do anything anymore, theydecided to get off,'' he said. ``Everybody was jumping into the sea.Others took the lifeboats. But there were so many people that theydecided to jump and swim. They looked very tired. They stayed in thewater for three hours.''   Cabigon quoted survivors as saying that some passengers were sofrightened they claimed they saw an island nearby and swam towardit, although the storm had reduced visibility to nearly zero at thetime.   He quoted survivor Alberto Oledo as saying he jumped overboardwith his wife, son and daughter. The three held hands but wereseparated in the raging seas, and Oledo was the only who reachedland.   Cabigon said 120 of the 179 survivors managed to reach the remoteisland of Almagro in lifejackets and life boats.   Go said 26 bodies were recovered, but the Coast Guard put thefigure at 32. There was no explanation for the discrepancy.   The Dona Marilyn was trying to maneuver to the western side ofMasbate island, away from Ruby's approach to the east, but wasbuffeted by strong waves and winds of up to 140 mph, Cabigon said.   The coast guard said the skipper reported the vessel listing tothe port side in heavy seas in a radio distress signal before theship went down.   Mrs. Aquino told reporters she ordered an investigation of thesinking. ``I'm telling (the transportation minister) to investigatethis and find out why they still sailed during very bad weather.''   Go said he could not explain why the vessel sailed Sunday,despite the approach of the typhoon, because he was unable tointerview surviving crew members.   In December, another Sulpicio ship, the Dona Paz, collided withan oil tanker off Mindoro island. The official death toll was 1,749,but other estimates said more than 3,000 were killed. Only 28 peoplesurvived.</TEXT></DOC>
