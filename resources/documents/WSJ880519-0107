The company, Canada's fifth-largest trust concern, said the move is being taken for reasons of administrative efficiency but there are indications that Montreal Trustco also aims to remove itself from proposed federal legislation on trust companies that will be more restrictive than provincial laws.    Robert Gratton, Montreal Trustco's chairman, complained at the company's annual meeting in March about proposed federal limitations on ownership of trust concerns by commercial interests as well as the government's proposed ban on the sale of insurance by banks and trust companies. He said the restrictions place federally regulated trust companies at a disadvantage when compared with provincially regulated concerns, particularly in Quebec and Ontario.    Montreal Trustco is considered to have commercial links because it is 60.5%-held by Power Financial Corp., a unit of Power Corp. of Canada, which has other industrial holdings.    Montreal Trustco currently operates through two trust subsidiaries, Montreal Trust Co., which has a Quebec charter, and Montreal Trust Co. of Canada, which has a federal charter. The federal concern was originally set up in 1978 at the height of the Quebec separatist movement. Montreal Trustco's assets, which total 9.4 billion Canadian dollars ($7.6 billion) are split about evenly between the two.    A trust company is similar to a U.S. savings and loan.    Under the plan, announced by notice in a Montreal newspaper last weekend, Montreal Trust of Canada plans to seek passage of a private bill in Parliament allowing the company &quot;to be continued as a trust company under the laws of the province of Quebec.&quot;    Richard Despres, Montreal Trustco's vice president of public affairs, said the main reason for the switch is for &quot;reasons of administrative efficiency.&quot; He said the Quebec jurisdiction was chosen because the original company was chartered in Quebec and &quot;there's an historic relationship with Quebec.&quot;    He insisted that the decision has nothing to do with Ottawa's policy on commercial links. However, he added that the new federal law will complicate the management of companies that have both federal and provincial charters.    John Evans, president of the Trust Companies Association of Canada, said Ottawa's proposed curbs on closely held, commercially linked financial institutions &quot;aren't producing a situation conducive for further federal chartering.&quot;    Mr. Evans said that &quot;if other companies move in this direction,&quot; it could could force Ottawa to review its policy. However, a spokesman for Thomas Hockins, Canada's minister of state for finance, said he isn't concerned at all by Montreal Trustco's move.    &quot;It just makes good business sense to consolidate under one regime,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
