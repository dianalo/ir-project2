The move strengthened indications that U.S. authorities plan to bring criminal proceedings against the defendants. The U.S. asked Swiss authorities to freeze the accounts under a treaty that covers legal assistance between the two countries only in criminal matters.    The Swiss government's order covers the Swiss deposits of Nahum Vaskevitch, the former Merrill Lynch official; Israeli businessman David Sofer; and Plenmeer Ltd. and Meda Establishment. The SEC alleged March 11 that Messrs. Vaskevitch and Sofer were behind an insider-trading scheme that netted $4 million in illicit profits, using accounts at Plenmeer and Meda. Plenmeer, based in Britain, and Meda, based in Liechtenstein, are trading companies whose activities in this case were directed by Mr. Sofer, the SEC says.    The SEC has said its investigation is continuing. Persons familiar with the case say the commission is cooperating with a related criminal investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in New York.    Obtaining Mr. Sofer's and Mr. Vaskevitch's overseas assets is crucial to the U.S. government's efforts to obtain penalties in the insider-trading case.    The SEC is seeking penalties of as much as three times the alleged illicit profit, or a maximum penalty of more than $12 million. But persons familiar with the government's investigation say the two defendants don't have anywhere near that much money in the U.S. The government knows of $500,000 in one U.S. Plenmeer account and estimates that the defendants have roughly another $500,000 in the U.S, according to persons familiar with the investigation.    Switzerland acted last Friday after an emergency request the same day by U.S. authorities, said Joerg Kistler, a spokesman for the Swiss Justice Department in Berne. Reached by telephone, Mr. Kistler said the government took action under a treaty provision that allows immediate measures in cases when assets are under suspicion of being transferred.    The order also froze deposits held by a third company that wasn't named in the SEC's charges, identified by Swiss sources as Kedem Publishing Co. It wasn't immediately clear where Kedem was based, or how, if at all, it ties into the SEC case. Kedem is a Hebrew word meaning &quot;ancient.&quot;    Mr. Vaskevitch couldn't be reached for comment and his wife, reached in London, declined to comment. Mr. Sofer's lawyer in New York, Stanley Arkin, didn't return telephone calls seeking comment.    Mr. Kistler wouldn't say how much money was frozen by the order, nor how many accounts were covered. The deposits all are at one Swiss bank, Mr. Kistler said, but he wouldn't name it.    However, in a memorandum filed at a federal court hearing in New York last week, the SEC alleged Mr. Sofer has transferred about $1.9 million from a U.S. account in Plenmeer's name to Credit Suisse in Zurich. The SEC also alleged that Mr. Sofer unsuccessfully tried to transfer about $500,000 from another U.S. Plenmeer account to Sogenal Bank in Zurich.    The government is especially worried that Mr. Sofer might try to move the $1.9 million out of Credit Suisse, now that it has publicly stated that it is aware of that account.    The U.S. also is seeking the Swiss bank-account records. Further legal proceedings will decide whether it obtains the documentation. Under the treaty, the U.S. must make a formal request within 30 days of its initial move on Friday.    The Swiss government's freeze lasts indefinitely, but can end if Switzerland later decides there is insufficient evidence of a crime. A lawyer for the SEC indicated in a U.S. court last Friday that Mr. Sofer would resist efforts to tie up his assets abroad.    Switzerland's fast response to the U.S. freeze request is a further hint of its growing willingness to prevent wrongdoers from hiding behind that country's bank-secrecy laws. In past cases, Switzerland usually has granted requests under the mutual-assistance treaty only after criminal charges have been brought. In this case, Mr. Kistler said, &quot;we got enough evidence from the U.S. to take provisional measures.&quot; Under the treaty, he added, &quot;it's enough that an investigation is under way.&quot;    The Swiss government also has rebuffed some past pleas for help from the U.S. in insider-trading cases because such trading isn't illegal in Switzerland. The treaty covers only acts that are a crime in both countries. In their request, however, U.S. authorities cited Swiss laws making it a crime to divulge business secrets, which would include advance knowledge of corporate takeovers.    Last Friday, a U.S. court in New York extended an order freezing all assets of Messrs. Sofer and Vaskevitch. Mr. Vaskevitch was Merrill Lynch's former head of mergers in London.    ---   Michael W.
