(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This tiny Ozarks community proudly calls itself``Missouri's Christmas City,'' but there's little holiday cheerthis season because the murder of the town's popular bank presidentremains unsolved.   More than two months have passed since Dan Short was kidnappedfrom his home in predawn darkness and forced to open the State Bankof Noel vault for his abductors, who took about $70,000.   His kidnappers taped him to a chair weighted with concreteblocks and a 30-pound chain, then threw him from a bridge into anOklahoma lake, where he drowned.   The FBI says it has no suspects and few leads. Many people inthe town of 1,200 near the Arkansas and Oklahoma borders believethe odds of finding Short's killers shrink daily because of thelack of suspects and evidence.   ``The consensus of people who come in and out of my post officeis it will go unsolved,'' Postmaster Bill Poage said.   Nearly every door on festively decorated Main Street bears ayellow ribbon ``to signify we're waiting for Dan's killers to becaught,'' said Dan Coleman, who bought his hardware store with aloan from Short's bank.   The 51-year-old president of the town's lone bank is rememberedas a ``genuine nice guy'' and community booster.   After moving to Noel in 1986, Short did commentary on radiobroadcasts of high school sporting events and wrote a weekly sportscolumn for an area newspaper.   Only hours before he was abducted, Short agreed to be master ofceremonies at the community Christmas parade for the thirdconsecutive year.   ``He was the kind of guy who, instead of sending someone to getthe mail each morning, would walk to the post office and get ithimself,'' Coleman said.   FBI special agent Max Geiman said investigators have not foundanyone in Short's 24-year banking career who might want to kill him.   What investigators do know is this:   About 3 a.m. on Oct. 6, a vehicle believed to be carrying threemen drove to Short's home about five miles southwest of Noel.Short, who lived alone, was awakened and forcibly driven to thebank.   Someone also drove Short's pickup truck to the bank.   Two shots from a .45-caliber revolver disabled the bank'ssurveillance camera and the lens was spray-painted.   Short opened the vault and his abductors scooped up cash _police will say only that it was in the neighborhood of $70,000 _mostly in $5 and $2 bills and quarters.   The FBI believes the kidnappers intended all along to kill Shortafter he opened the vault. They bound his hands and feet with ducttape, taped him to an antique chair and tossed him from a bridgeinto Grand Lake of the Cherokees, about 10 miles west of Noel. Hisbody was found five days later.   Gerald Elkins, a reporter for the McDonald County Press,portrayed Short in a re-enactment of the crime for the syndicatedtelevision series ``Hard Copy.''   ``When they tied me up and tipped me over the bridge, I knewthere was no danger of me falling but it was still frightening,''he said. ``At that point, Dan Short knows he's going to get killed.You know he was scared to death.''   Floodlights have gone up around homes since Short's murder, saidDonald Duncan, Short's friend and golf partner. The close-knitcommunity will probably never feel totally safe again, he said.   Many fear that Short knew his killers and that they are still inthe area. The FBI has not ruled out that possibility, Geiman said.   Banks in at least three states have posted a $50,000 reward, andGeiman said the FBI is optimistic the case will eventually besolved.   Meanwhile, residents are trying to get on with their lives,hoping that the killers will eventually be brought to justice.   ``It's with you 24 hours a day, but you have to get your mindback on business,'' Duncan said. ``Life goes on.''</TEXT></DOC>
