That's largely because the smaller stocks are still recovering from the beating most of them took last year. The typical midsized OTC issue is still below the price it was at 16 months ago, and smaller issues have fared even worse.    The average midsized Nasdaq stock slipped 12.9% in price last year, according to Nasdaq records. That's more than double the 5.3% decline last year in the Nasdaq composite index. The index is weighted so that larger OTC issues, which weren't hurt as badly, count more heavily. For the biggest exchange-listed issues, the boom and bust of 1987 amounted to roughly a wash.    Small and midsized Nasdaq issues began their collapse several months before the October crash, missing much of the bull market's surge. OTC fund managers and other institutional investors purged their portfolios of these issues last summer in favor of large Nasdaq stocks and exchange-listed issues that were rising rapidly.    Even so, midsized OTC stocks went on to tumble 28.4% in the fourth quarter, compared with a 25.6% slide in the composite index, according to the National Association of Securities Dealers.    Now the midsized and smaller issues are rebounding a bit more vigorously than large OTC stocks. The typical midsized Nasdaq stock climbed 15% in the first quarter, while the composite index was rising 13.4%.    But the smaller stocks are still relatively depressed, suggesting to some analysts that their recovery has further to run. The average Nasdaq share at the end of March had a value of $9.52, according to Nasdaq figures, down 2% from $9.68 at the end of 1986. In the same 15-month period, the larger OTC issues, as reflected by the composite index that they dominate, climbed more than 7%.    Of the 40 biggest gainers last week on Nasdaq's 2,928-stock National Market System, 23 were small issues with market values of less than $25 million; 12 of them had values of less than $12 million. Only three of the issues on the list were relatively large ones, with $100 million or more in market value.    Many of the strongest Nasdaq stocks in the past few weeks have been among the 1,747 small or thinly traded issues that aren't in Nasdaq's National Market System.    For example, Fashion Channel Network last week jumped 1 to 2 7/8, a 53% leap, amid recurring rumors that other cable operators may bail out the struggling six-month-old cable-television shopping channel. Mikron Instrument climbed 1 to 3 3/4 during the week, a 36.4% gain; the issue has a market value of less than $4 million.    Houston Biomedical, a $15 million market value non-NMS issue, climbed from 11 5/8 to 15 1/4 in the past six trading days, a 29% increase.    On Friday, 32.3 million National Market System shares rose in price while 19.9 million fell, a ratio of a little more than 3 to 2. But among non-NMS issues, nine million rose and just 3.6 million fell, a ratio of 2 1/2 to 1.    However, small National Market System issues have been spurting in price, too. Last week's biggest gainers included Zygo, a $15 million issue that rose 1 1/2 to 6, a 33% gain.    Sunair Electronics, a $22 million NMS issue, climbed to 7 from 5 1/4, a 33% rise. The company posted higher profit for its second quarter, ended March 31. And Unifast, a fastener and screw maker with about $8 million in market value, climbed 1 1/4 to 6 1/4, up 25%.    Many of last week's standout small-stock gainers were issues that hadn't attracted investor attention since the crash. Sunair, for example, slipped a bit in the first quarter. Andover Togs, an Andover, Maine-based children's apparel maker, rose 16% last week, to 3 5/8 from 3 1/8, but is still below its end-1987 price of 3 3/4. Epsco, a $14 million market-value communications equipment maker, rose 17% last week to 10 1/4 from 8 3/4; in the first quarter, it dropped 7%.    This characteristic, according to several regional OTC brokers, reflects a drive by individual investors to find undervalued issues. Brokers aren't having much trouble finding several dozen new candidates each week, although their hunt lately has extended more deeply into the non-NMS issues. </TEXT></DOC>
