The slaying of the young activists of the Social ChristianPopular Movement, discovered Tuesday, comes a week after 10 peoplewere killed in the bombing of a leftist labor union's downtownheadquarters.   Leftist political leaders blame the military for both incidents,which reflect a rise in attacks on civilians in the 10-year-oldcivil war.   There are widespread fears that rightist death squads are againon the prowl after lying low for four years.   Julio Flores, a Social Christian spokesman, said military mendressed in civilian clothes seized the three party members Mondaynight after a meeting in Sonsonate, a provincial capital 40 mileswest of San Salvador.   The victims were found dumped on Sonsonate's outskirts Tuesdayevening bearing all the hallmarks of the death squads: they had beentortured, shot repeatedly, and a hand-lettered sign nearby said theywere ``executed'' because they ``betrayed the fatherland,'' Floressad.   He said in a telephone interview that the party is demanding thatSonsonate military commander Col. Juan Armando Rodriguez turn thesoldiers involved over to civilian judicial authorities.   ``We hold those military officials ... responsible,'' he said.   Flores identified one of the victims as Cecilio Rivera, themovement's Sonsonate coordinator. He did not have Rivera's age orthe names and ages of the other two, he said, because of poortelephone communications.   Local judicial authorities ordered the three buried asunidentified corpses shortly after they were found, but Flores saidparty members were able to see the bodies and identified them.   The slayings, a recent wave of bombings and other attacks havethreatened to scuttle negotiations for a cease-fire in the civil warand to force leftist political groups back underground.   Flores said Social Christian leaders ordered all party officesand halls temporarily closed Tuesday because they did not want moremembers killed. ``The authorities are threatening us, they do notlet us operate,'' he said.   Most of the more than 70,000 people killed in the civil war werecivilians slain by the right-wing death squads from 1979 to 1984 onsuspicion of being leftists, according to the Roman Catholic Churchand human rights groups.   Death squad activity dropped sharply in mid-1984 with theelection of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a centrist ChristianDemocrat, but attacks on leftists picked up when rightist PresidentAlfredo Cristiani took office June 1 for a five-year term.   Leftist leaders accuse Cristiani's Republican NationalistAlliance, or Arena, of links to the death squads, which haveenlisted off-duty military and security agents.   They blame the military for bomb attacks Oct. 31 on the NationalWorkers' Federation, or Fenastras, and Comadres, an organization ofrelatives of political prisoners and people who have disappeared inthe war. The attacks killed 10 people and injured 33.   Leaders of Fenastras and Comadres say the bombings were inretaliation for a mortar attack the previous day by leftist rebelson the Defense Ministry compound that killed one civilian andwounded 15.   On Oct. 19, a bomb exploded at the home of Ruben Zamora, theSocial Christian leader, but no one was hurt. The movement wascreated in 1980 by dissidents who broke away from Duarte's ChristianDemocratic Party.   Zamora is a member of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, apolitical coalition allied with the guerrillas. He returned to ElSalvador two years ago from exile after the Duarte governmentpromised an end to repression.   To protest the Oct. 31 attacks, the rebel Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front canceled its participation in a thirdround of cease-fire negotiations with Cristiani's representativesset for Nov. 20-21 in Caracas, Venezuela.   Earlier meetings in Mexico and Costa Rica resulted in deadlock,but the two sides pledged to continue meeting at 30-day intervalsuntil they could agree on some kind of a truce.</TEXT></DOC>
