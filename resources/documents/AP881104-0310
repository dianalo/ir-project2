Viruses strike at the promise that people can manipulate massiveprojects from their own keyboards while trading time-saving programsfreely with friends and colleagues.   Although viruses spread by pranksters and criminals have causedlittle damage so far, they have the potential to wreak havoc bydestroying data or impeding the computers that are increasinglyimportant to business and government.   As a result, security measures are sure to increase, which willmake computers less convenient and accessible.   ``The brave new world of computing, I think, is still becoming areality. But there's a (need for a) gatekeeper,'' Richard tenEyck,telecommunications director of the Boston Computer Society, saidFriday.   A virus that swept across the country this week temporarilycrippled the computing centers of several major universities andresearch centers. Business began to return to normal Friday ascomputer operators cleaned out copies of the rapidly multiplyingprogram.   In attempts to control viruses, there will be much stricterlimits on who can use certain programs and databases and under whatconditions. This will make it harder for people to work together incomputer networks.   New pieces of software, no matter how seemingly beneficial, willbe tested at length, especially if they come from insecure sources.   Certain programs that check for evidence of contamination will berun every time someone sits down to use a piece of software, causingfrustrating delays.   There could even be delays in everyday activities such as using acredit card.   In short, steps to protect against computer viruses will draincomputers of two of their most important attributes: speed andaccessibility.   ``What I think it does is spell the end of the user-friendlyera,'' tenEyck said.   Even with time-consuming and expensive precautions, viruses willremain a problem.   Once a computer has been contaminated with a virus it is almostimpossible to ensure that every trace of the virus has beeneradicated, said Mary Carol Chruscicki, program manager for systemreliability work at a Rome, N.Y., institute that performs studiesfor the Defense Department.   Some people have expressed concerns that the danger of computerviruses will turn the clock back to the days when the only computerswere mainframes in locked ``glass houses,'' operated by people inwhite coats.   Ms. Chruscicki said she does not think that will happen.   ``The world of information is here and computer users don't wantto go back to where they're sheltered from what's out there, whetherit's a low-cost product or a free product,'' she said.   ``The key issue is that with proper precautions, one can continueto live a normal existence,'' said Delbert Jones of the National LANLaboratory in Reston, Va.   More than 60 companies this week endorsed a set of guidelinesdrafted by the National LAN Laboratory that are intended to preventand control viruses.   Among the recommendations:   _All software should be purchased from known, reputable sources.   _New software should be quarantined on an isolated computer fortesting.   _Back-up copies of all master software and computer data shouldbe made at least once a month so the back-ups can be used if thecurrent versions are corrupted by a virus.   ``It's very much like the AIDS virus: The best solution isprecaution,'' Jones said.   A computer virus is a program that ``infects'' other programs bymodifying them to include a copy of itself. It can spread from onecomputer to another and alter or destroy data.   Viruses are usually communicated by data transmission over phonelines, or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into acomputer.   However, computer viruses have been found in packaged softwarefrom Aldus Corp. At one Texas company, a computer ``time bomb''planted by a fired employee wiped out 168,000 payroll records threeyears ago.   Last December, International Business Machines Corp. had to shutdown its worldwide network to eradicate a multiplying piece of code.   Jones said precautions will inevitably, but necessarily, delaythe work done by computers.   ``You're going to find some hard choices having to be madebetween a user's ability to produce top-quality output and the costsof providing that user with free access,'' tenEyck said.   Many of the precautions that will be put in place are longoverdue, analysts said.   Even the Defense Department, which keeps its most importantcomputers locked in vaults, does not seal the machines from theoutside world, said Ms. Chruscicki, of the IIT Research Institute'sbranch in Rome, N.Y.   ``The problem is with these viruses, while you are in the non-topsecret mode, that virus could be getting in there. We don't havemechanisms in place to detect that,'' she said.   She said the Defense Department's attempts to improve securitywere being delayed by budget cuts. ``Everyone knows what to do.It's, who's going to pay for it?''</TEXT></DOC>
