The new AD is needed to preventfailure of the main rotor blade root fittings or the hub lead-lag linkswhich could result in loss of a main rotor blade in flight with subsequentloss of the helicopter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2><T3>Effective </T3>June 12, 1989.<T3>Compliance: </T3>As indicated in the body of the AD.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The applicable service information notices may be obtainedfrom MDHC Technical Publications, Building 543/D214, McDonnell DouglasHelicopter Company, 5000 E.

Afterissuing AD 79-18-11, as amended by AD 79-18-11R1, the FAA has determinedthat cracking of the main rotor blade fitting attach lugs and the lead-laglinks has occurred on later dash number and serial number parts not includedin AD 79-18-11R1. Also, anticorrosion treatments of the main rotor hublead-lag link assemblies, part number (P/N) 369H1203, have been provenineffective. These parts are also installed on other MDHC Model 369 serieshelicopters. Therefore, the FAA is superseding AD 79-18-11, as amendedby AD 79-18-11R1, with a new AD requiring inspection and checks of previouslymodified parts (assemblies with the suffix letter ``M'' added to the serialnumber which were originally affected by AD 79-18-11 and subsequently modifiedby MDHC to incorporate anticorrosion provisions) and parts with later serialnumbers and dash numbers; extension of the applicability to other MDHCModel 369 series helicopters; and removal of damaged parts from service.The applicable main rotor blade assemblies have P/N's 369A1100-BSC,   -501,-503, -505, -601, 369D21100-BSC, -503, -505, -507, -509, -511, -513, and369D21102-BSC. The applicable main rotor hub lead-lag link assemblies haveP/N's 369A1203-BSC, -3, -11, 369H1203-BSC, -11, -21, and -31.Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable andgood cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand that it is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291.It is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of ExecutiveOrder 12291 with respect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediatelyto correct an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determinedthat this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this actionis subsequently determined to involve a significant/major regulation, afinal regulatory evaluation or analysis, as appropriate, will be preparedand placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluation or analysisis not required). A copy of it, when filed, may be obtained by contactingthe Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``Addresses.''<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39    </ITAG>Aircraft, Aviation safety<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Part 39_Airworthiness Directives    </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection;39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:    1.
