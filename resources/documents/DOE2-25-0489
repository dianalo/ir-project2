The OTSGs returned to as-new operating condition and Unit1 was restored to full-power operation. 2) The Oconee Nuclear Stationchemical cleaning system functioned as designed with only minor problems.Operating personnel made a significant contribution to ensuring on-scheduleperformance. 3) Corrosion monitoring systems performed as designed providingon-line corrosion monitoring and demonstrating that OTSG corrosion duringthe cleaning was kept within allowable values. Post-cleaning visual inspectionand eddy current inspections also indicated the process was successful,with no adverse effects noted. 4) The cleaning was executed on scheduleduring a planned 65-day refueling outage that included many other complexfirst-of-a-kind OTSG repair tasks.
