The opinion was issued Friday by an en banc panel of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In a hearing last March, lawyers' groups argued that, without an exemption for attorneys' fees, the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984 deprives defendants of both due process and counsel of choice. The statute applies only to defendants indicted on federal narcotics or racketeering charges.    An en banc hearing, before a full panel of 12 appeals-court judges, is held occasionally for cases deemed particularly significant. This panel was convened to reconsider an appeal by Peter Monsanto, one of several defendants who are now on trial in Manhattan on narcotics and racketeering charges. At his trial Mr. Monsanto has been represented by court-appointed counsel. He sought to use his assets to pay a lawyer of his own choice.    The panel's decision was hailed by Edward M. Chikofsky of the New York law firm of Parcher Arisohn andamp; Hayes, Mr. Monsanto's attorney before the panel. &quot;We consider it a major victory for the defendant's constitutional right to counsel of choice,&quot; Mr. Chikofsky said. &quot;And it's a major setback to the government's use of forfeiture statutes as a means of depriving defendants and their attorneys of the proper attorney-client relationship.&quot;    Late last year a three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled that the forfeiture provisions can apply to funds needed to pay attorneys' fees. The 12-judge panel vacated that ruling.    Stanley S. Arkin, a prominent white-collar defense attorney in New York, said the opinion was &quot;the only sensible thing to have done.&quot; He added, &quot;For a lawyer to be at risk or in jeopardy in representing a client and being paid fairly would diminish a lawyer's zeal for a client who is entitled to have a passionate representative.&quot;    Chief Judge Wilfred Feinberg said in Friday's opinion: &quot;The Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice is a fundamental right that serves to protect other constitutional rights. It is a key element in our system of criminal justice and distinguishes that system from others that do not allow individuals the chance to resist in a meaningful way the imposition of government power upon them.&quot;    The government said it hadn't decided whether it would seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court. </TEXT></DOC>
