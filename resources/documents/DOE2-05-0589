Conventional approachesto protection have used either extremely hard coatings or complaint elastomericcoatings. The former are typically ceramic or ceramic-like surfaces producedby direct deposition or by in situ formation by oxidation, carburizationor nitriding. Ceramic coatings are very good against abrasion, but arevulnerable to impact damage. Elastomeric coatings have excellent impactresistance and are capable of withstanding deformation; however, theyare limited in thermal range and chemical resistance. It is possibleto combine the desirable properties of both types by using ``hair,''a structure in which an extremely hard material can be simultaneouslyelastic and compliant by virture of a very high L/D ratio. We have demonstratedthe good performance of carbon fiber ``hair'' in resisting damage fromimpacting particles and have identified a probable failure mechanism.7 refs., 6 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
