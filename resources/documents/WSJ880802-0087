At Brookrock Corp. in Delaware, a recycler of certain laser-printer parts, 80% of workers are disabled. Honeywell forms a Handicapped Employees Council to help them reach career goals; it aims to make all facilities usable for the handicapped in five years. With federal funds, Goodwill Industries places over 400 handicapped persons in restaurant work.    Disabled workers hold most every kind of job in Wendy's restaurants. They're more serious about work than other employees, says Panhandle Eastern. Midway Airlines has hired 16 disabled persons in two years; it says it didn't hire more because people in wheelchairs can't use its old headquarters building. Federal contract rules spur many hiring plans for the disabled, says a Pittsburgh rehabilitation center.    But 8.2 million disabled are still jobless, yet willing to work, a presidential committee says.    OH, MY ACHING BACK is a common worker complaint.    An estimated 10 million U.S. employees suffer work-impairing back pain each year, says the Bureau of National Affairs, a labor reporting service. The ailment is costly, producing $5 billion annually in worker's compensation payments alone. An Eastman Kodak study found back pain was the second leading cause of missed work, next to upper respiratory illness.    Why back pains develop isn't known. But ways to control it are being developed, and a 1987 Public Health Service study said 41% of firms with back-care programs lowered their health-care costs. Citing employer case studies, the BNA report says the impact of back pain can be reduced. Ford Motor Co. redesigns jobs; Kerr-McGee adds training and exercise programs.    COLLEGE GRADS SHUN federal government jobs.    The Merit Systems Protection Board surveyed 100-plus college deans and placement officials, and concluded that most students don't see the government as an &quot;employer of choice.&quot; Lower pay was one reason -- up to 55% less than for private jobs, for engineers and attorneys. Also cited: the federal bureaucracy's negative public image and a lack of aggressive on-campus recruiting.    When 365 Yale seniors were asked if they favored a federal career, only one said &quot;yes,&quot; and &quot;I suspect he . . . read the question wrong,&quot; says Paul Volcker, now chairman of the National Commission on the Public Service. Only a third of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government grads go into the government.    Harvard President Derek Bok decries the &quot;hypocrisy&quot; of urging grads to tackle society's problems while making it difficult for them to do so.    ON THE OTHER HAND, when top government officials seek jobs outside, it's name recognition, contacts, influence and power that count with employers. Skills or knowledge aren't vital, says Paul R. Ray andamp; Co., executive search firm.    NERVOUS QUOTIENT: Some 60% of women executives, compared with 40% of males, are &quot;uncomfortable&quot; addressing senior managers, a survey of large-firm execs by Olsten Services, temporary help firm, shows. Men see their vocabulary as a strength; for women, it's their weakness.    WORK PROSPECTS will glow for the health-care field, says a new edition of the Labor Department's Occupational Outlook Handbook. By the year 2000, big job rises are seen for doctors, nurses, medical record technicians and physical therapists. Major gains are also seen for computer systems specialists and legal aides.    DON'T OVERDOSE: Prolonged high-level use of temporary workers by information systems units can be bad, says consultant A.T. Kearney. Its study of large industrial and financial firms showed that employee leasing can mean eroded technical skills, loss of the firm's proprietary data, and lower employee morale.    MERGER MANIA adds pressure to hold down labor costs.    Takeovers, or their threat, spur managers even more to plan work-force cuts and to resist worker demands for pay-and-benefit gains, often because debt may balloon in the acquisition. Lucky Stores foresees benefit-plan changes and layoffs emerging from its planned buy-out of American Stores. Stop andamp; Shop workers struck twice to force the new owner, leveraged buy-out specialist Kohlberg Kravis, to pay usual wage rises.    Food-industry &quot;takeover mania&quot; and leveraged buy-outs mean some firms need &quot;every dime that comes in&quot; to pay off the debt, creating undue bargaining resistance, says the Food and Commercial Workers Union. In this month's contract talks with men's garment makers, the Clothing and Textile Workers expects a similar attitude.    Venture capital firms are taking tighter control over firms they acquire, after last fall's stock-market crash, says search firm Thorndike Deland.    THE CHECKOFF: The National Writers Union claims a partial victory in its long dispute with the Village Voice, getting the newspaper to acknowledge that the union represents free-lancers in disputes with management. . . . A minimum-wage boost is needed so young workers can meet living costs and plan for job training or education, contends Uniforce Temporary Services. . . . Major firms, including Control Data, Goodyear and Union Carbide, meet in Washington tomorrow to develop ways to educate workers about organ and tissue donation. </TEXT></DOC>
