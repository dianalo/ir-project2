Police at the scene said the 7{-ton truck was loaded with emptypropane gas tanks in an attempt to discourage border guards fromfiring their weapons.   The East German border police apparently did not open fire, andthe three men fled uninjured, said a police spokesman, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   The truck crashed through two steel gates and an electrifiedfence on the East German side, raced across the bridge and smashedthrough another control gate in West Berlin, police said.
