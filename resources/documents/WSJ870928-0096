The contract is with the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization, a consortium of 26 European countries that provides telephone, television and other satellite transmissions to most of the continent. The order calls for the launch of a Eutelsat II communications satellite in 1990, with options for as many as two more launches, General Dynamics said.    The St. Louis-based company declined to disclose the financial terms of the contract, but said the cost of each launch is about $59 million.    General Dynamics is the latest U.S. company to step into the commercial space arena to fill a void left by last year's space shuttle disaster. Following the accident, President Reagan banned commercial satellite launches from future shuttle missions. General Dynamics is competing for commercial launches with Bethesda, Md.-based Martin Marietta Corp. and St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
