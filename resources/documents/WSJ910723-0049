I'm a bitworried about the Message Center from Pacific Bell.

Pacific Bell and five other regional phone companies areincreasingly pushing &quot;voice mail&quot; technology as analternative to the answering machine. And so far,notwithstanding a few glitches, the wake-up calls seem to begetting through. Since introducing residential voice mail twoyears ago, the Baby Bells have signed up nearly a millioncustomers, including an estimated 250,000 by market leader US West Inc.   Service is spotty, and in many areas around the nationvoice-mail service still isn't available. Nevertheless, &quot;Ithink 10 years down the line, the table-top answering machinewill be a thing of the past,&quot; says Joel Gross,telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette.   In the business world, voice mail is old hat; it has beenaround for more than a decade, allowing companies to cutcosts by shedding receptionists.   Voice-mail services for the home have also been around foryears, but the companies operating them haven't had themarketing clout or efficiencies of scale that the Baby Bellspossess. These older vendors are being severely wounded bythe latest blitz and are complaining about the fairness ofthe price competition and selling tactics. The phonecompanies have been free to sell voice mail since a 1988court decision.   Voice mail's big pitch is that it is more sophisticatedthan an answering machine with even less hassle. Incomingphone messages are directed to electronic &quot;mail boxes&quot; for upto eight different family members or household residents. Thesystems are such that callers no longer receive busy signalswhen a subscriber is on the telephone but are routed to amailbox and given a chance to leave a message. (That's ahidden plus for telephone companies, because it means areduction in the number of uncompleted calls -- ergo, morerevenue.)   Voice mail is also handy for transmitting multiplemessages, boosters say. Some systems allow subscribers to&quot;broadcast&quot; a single message to as many as eight recipients,meaning if you are running late for an appointment and needto notify several friends, you need only make the call once.   The systems work from any phone in the home, unlikeanswering machines, and new features are being added all thetime: Nynex has plans to add automatic wake-up calls andmailboxes for guests, for instance.   Last year, voice-mail revenue increased 28% to $810million from $635 million in 1989, according to ProbeResearch Inc., a Cedar Knolls, N.J., market-research firm.Answering-machine sales, meanwhile, slipped 19% to $671million. Octel Communications Corp., of Milpitas, Calif.;American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Corp.; and Rolm Systems, aSanta Clara, Calif., unit of Siemens AG, are the top threevoice-mail equipment makers. ATandamp;T is also a big factor inanswering machines, along with Matsushita Electric IndustrialCo.'s Panasonic.   The voice-mail industry is counting on people likeCrawford Cragun of Denver to make the big switch. Mr. Cragun,an unemployed bank officer, has been seeking new work andfigured voice mail would ensure that he wouldn't miss anyinquiries from prospective employers while he tied up thephone. &quot;I'll never use my answering machine again,&quot; he says.   Voice mail's main drawback is that it isn't cheap. Itcosts $5 to $10 a month, depending on the telephone company.Installation runs another $7, although those charges aresometimes waived.   Some observers say customers will resist having to pay amonthly charge when they can make a single payment for ananswering machine.   &quot;People didn't want to pay for their phones 20 times overand they won't want to pay for {the equivalent of} a newanswering machine every year,&quot; says Debbie Sanders, chief ofproduct development at Code-A-Phone Inc., atelephone-equipment maker in Portland, Ore.   Others question whether voice mail is loaded with too manyfeatures. &quot;How often will someone want to send messages outon a broadcast list?&quot; asks Stephanie Georges, an analyst withSalomon Brothers Inc. And for all the benefits of voice mail,answering-machine makers say voice-mail vendors overlook thebiggest residential feature of all: Most people use answeringmachines to listen to -- and screen -- their incoming calls,something they can't do with a voice-mail service.   The phone companies have a goal of installing voice mailin one in 10 households they serve (they won't disclose theircurrent market penetration), but Ms. Georges thinks they maybe overly ambitious.   Makers of answering machines aren't exactly putting theirdevelopment efforts on hold, either. &quot;I see answeringmachines getting more intelligent so they'd customize answersto different people,&quot; says Robert Lucky, executive directorfor communications sciences at ATandamp;T's Bell Labs.   Technical snags could also undercut enthusiasm for voicemail. Pacific Bell, for instance, was embarrassed when itsballyhooed Message Center service opened last November.During the next four months, service was interrupted 15 times-- and this while the Baby Bell was filling the radio airwayswith ads excoriating the answering machine for being finicky.   The snafus forced Pacific Bell temporarily to suspendadvertising its voice-mail service. The system now is free ofbugs and the glitches never made customers &quot;irate enough tocancel the service,&quot; says Keith Epstein, executive directorof Pacific Bell's information-services group.   U S West also has faced difficulties with its system.&quot;Sometimes it breaks down and it takes me five days to findout because the company sometimes never bothers to mentionit,&quot; says Ginger Perry, a Boulder, Colo., subscriber.   But rivals are complaining even louder. Among the noisiestare the 200 or so private voice-mail vendors that pioneeredthe field. On the one hand, these mostly smaller suppliersrely on their local telephone company for hooking up theirservices, which pushes the retail price of their voice-mailproduct to as much as $25 a month. Now, they must alsoconsider their lifeline suppliers as direct competition.   The Baby Bells' &quot;marketing practices are scandalous,&quot; saysMark J. Golden, president of the Association of TelemessagingServices International, an organization for the privatevoice-mail concerns. The group finds it unfair that telephonecompanies can peddle voice mail in connection with otherservices and is attacking them &quot;in as many states as we canget regulators to pay attention,&quot; according to Mr. Golden.Thus far, however, the association has had no success withregulators.   Because of their size and diversity, Baby Bells also canundercut prices charged by their non-telephone rivals, makingit doubly hard to compete. Says Frederick L. Gladstone,president of Western Secretary, a San Diego voice-mailconcern: &quot;We're strapping on our seat belts.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
