The two sides are expected to announce in London, possiblytoday, that they have settled a 1989 lawsuit that Apple Corpsfiled against the computer concern over the use of the&quot;Apple&quot; logo. The personal-computer maker is believed to haveagreed to pay an amount roughly equal to a $29 millionreserve that it set aside this year to cover costs of thelitigation.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The court will be informed, if they have not alreadybeen, in the next couple of days,&quot; Stephen Tenenbaum, a LosAngeles adviser to Apple Corps, said of the settlement.   The legal discord between the two Apples started with a1981 agreement in which Apple Computer purchased the rightsto use the &quot;Apple&quot; logo on its PCs and related equipment.   Apple Corps, which the Beatles set up in the mid-1960s tomanage their creative affairs, had been seeking a royaltysince about the time Apple Computer was started in 1977. Butthe 1981 agreement made a few exceptions, including onebarring Apple Computer from using the trademark on equipmentthat was designed to synthesize music. That became a problemin 1984 when Apple plugged a semiconductor chip into itsMacintosh computer that allowed the machine to record andsynthesize sound.   Apple Corps sued Apple Computer in London in February1989.</TEXT></DOC>
