(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Steven BurkeandM;With growth slowing in the computer industry, two of the largest computercompanies and a top chip manufacturer are paying employees to quit.andM;IBM, Unisys Corp. and Motorola Inc. last week announced programs designed toreduce their work forces.andM;Officials at IBM, the $60 billion giant based in Armonk, N.Y., said theyexpect from 600 to 1,000 employees to leave.andP;  As many as 8,000 employees areexpected to leave Unisys, a $10 billion Blue Bell, Pa., company, according toofficials.andP;  And officials at Motorola, an $8 billion Schaumburg, Ill., chipmaker, said approximately 2,500 employees will walk.andM;IBM is offering one week of pay for each six months of service (up to oneyear's salary) to employees at four U.S.andP;  manufacturing and developmentsites.andM;Those eligible are non-technical administrative personnel, programmers anddevelopment engineers will not be affected.andM;According to IBM officials, the employee plan will have no effect on thecompany's 1989 earnings.andM;At Unisys, where second-quarter earnings were down 67 percent from one yearago, officials said the company will cut its work force from 88,000 to 80,000employees through layoffs and an early-retirement program.andM;Those departures will lower the company's break-even point by more than $1.5billion.andP;  A substantial restructuring charge will be included in Unisys'third-quarter financial results, which will be announced this month.andM;Unisys is offering all employees with more than four years of service eightweeks' notice, plus one week of severance pay for each year of service.andM;Under the retirement program, two years of service and two years of age areadded to calculate an employee's pension benefits.andM;Motorola is offering two weeks of pay for each year of service towhite-collar, salaried employees in its semiconductor and communicationsgroups.andM;The company is taking a pretax charge of approximately $43 million to coverthe anticipated costs of the program.andP;  That will be reflected in thethird-quarter earnings announced this week.andM;According to Motorola officials, the program would bring some &quot;businessesinto balance with changing business and market conditions.&quot;andM;When asked if the market was not growing as fast as the company hadanticipated, Motorola spokesman Albert Brashear refused to comment.andM;IBM officials, however, denied that the cuts were due to an industry slump.andO;The cuts are part of a continuing campaign to streamline operations,according to IBM spokesman John Reilly.andP;  &quot;Demand across our entire productline is good,&quot; Reilly explained.andM;But analysts said the industry is clearly not growing as fast as computer andsoftware companies had expected.andM;The strong dollar and its negative effect on companies doing big businessoverseas has spurred cost-cutting, according to Donald Bellomy, an analystwith market researcher International Data Corp. (IDC), in Framingham, Mass.andM;In 1988, international sales for multiuser systems grew 13 percent, accordingto IDC, and this year, that number is expected to drop to 4.5 percent.andP;  Thatwill mark the first year of single-digit growth in the multiuser computermarket since 1981.andP;  The PC market has not dropped off as badly as themultiuser market, according to Bellomy.andM;Bellomy added, however, that he expects further cutbacks, particularly bycompanies that are selling midrange computer systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
