Joseph Biden, stung by disclosures about plagiarism that have eroded his support, quit the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.    The Delaware Democrat, who said he took the step &quot;with incredible reluctance,&quot; reached the decision after a series of anguished meetings with aides and supporters. He said he would devote himself to the hearings he is leading on the nomination of Robert Bork to be a Supreme Court justice but vowed: &quot;There'll be other presidential campaigns, and I'll be there.&quot;    Mr. Biden's decision to end his three-month-old campaign amounted to an acknowledgment that the flood of negative reports about the senator drowned any hope of reviving his bid for the presidency.    In recent days, he has admitted using phrases from other politicians without attribution, being disciplined in law school for plagiarism, and inflating his mediocre academic performance in comments to reporters and to at least one campaign audience in New Hampshire.    &quot;In my zeal to rekindle (America's) idealism I have made mistakes,&quot; said Sen. Biden, adding: &quot;Now the exaggerated shadow of those mistakes has begun to obscure the essence of my candidacy and the essence of Joe Biden.&quot;    But political analysts in the early primary states said Mr. Biden's campaign had suffered irreparable damage. &quot;Once this broke, Biden wasn't in any position to attract any new support,&quot; says an Iowa Democratic Party official, &quot;and was in danger of seeing the support he has go away.&quot;    The withdrawal was motivated by an effort to salvage Mr. Biden's political reputation, to remove a distraction from his duties as Judiciary Committee chairman during the Bork hearings, and to shield him and his family from new disruptions.    The senator's departure from the race marks the second time in only four months that a Democratic contender has dropped out of the presidential campaign in the wake of damaging news reports. In May, former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado, considered the Democratic front-runner, withdrew after reports he spent parts of a weekend with Miami model and actress Donna Rice.    In prepared remarks read to reporters on Capitol Hill, Sen. Biden said he was &quot;frustrated at the environment of presidential politics that makes it so difficult to let the American people measure the whole Joe Biden and not just misstatements that I have made.&quot;    The withdrawal of Mr. Biden, whose campaign hadn't yet caught fire, doesn't change substantially the character of the race. He never cracked the top tier of the Democratic candidates -- the latest New Hampshire Poll showed him as the choice of only 3% of likely Democratic voters -- and his support is expected to be distributed among other contenders, chiefly Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee and former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona.    But his departure removes from the scene a candidate that some political analysts believed had much unrealized potential -- one whose fiery oratory seldom failed to inspire audiences and whose evocative personal style had appeal to the millions of baby-boom voters who have reached political maturity but who haven't yet reached fixed political allegiances.    In the end, of course, the stream of disclosures undercut Mr. Biden's strength, prompting political commentators and voters alike to wonder whether the passion he exhibited was as affected as his rhetoric, some of which had been lifted from John and Robert Kennedy and from Neil Kinnock, the British Labor Party leader.    A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken early this week showed that almost half of likely Democratic voters hadn't heard or read of the plagiarism furor. Those who were aware of it were evenly split over whether the senator should remain in the race or withdraw.    As recently as Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Biden was torn over the choices he faced. But the advice from most of his advisers was stark and direct, and overwhelmingly in favor of withdrawing from the race.&quot;His most ardent supporters are telling him the truth,&quot; said a senior congressional Democrat. &quot;His best friends are saying it's not worth it.&quot;    Mr. Biden's campaign raised about $3.7 million and has more than $500,000 on hand, enough to cover the expenses of closing up the campaign and meeting its outstanding financial obligations, according to the candidate's advisers. </TEXT></DOC>
