Beautiful villa ... secludedpool surrounded by a large patio bordered by tropical flowers andbushes,'' said an ad in a real estate booklet that arrived in manyWashington area homes this week.   The rent was $2,100 a week from January to April, $1,080 a weekfrom August to December.   The house was in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, devastated byHurricane Hugo on Sept. 17.   ``At this point, we are basically telling people who call forthe ad that to our knowledge, we have had damage, we don't know theextent of it, so we are not taking renters at this point,'' JorgenMuurman of suburban Arlington, Va., who placed the ad, saidThursday.   ``The ad, of course, went into that magazine before thehurricane struck.''   Muurman's wife, Laura Del Corona-Borgia, said the house, whichthey have owned for about 10 years, was one of two they had in St.Croix. She said they had recently retired and planned to move tothe second St. Croix house.   However, she said it, too, was believed to be severely damaged.   Muurman, a Dane, worked for the World Bank here. Ms. DelCorona-Borgia, an Italian, worked for the International MonetaryFund.   ``At this point, we only have reports from friends who have comeoff the island,'' Muurman said. ``None of them have been close toour houses, but we expect that it won't be in any condition to berented out for quite a while.''   The villa, according to the ad, ``has a magnificent view sinceit is situated on a hilltop overlooking the Caribbean Sea, and itis within walking distance of one of the best and most privatebeaches on St. Croix. 5 minutes from Christiansted, tennis and golfnearby.''   The house was vacant when the storm struck.</TEXT></DOC>
