Carlucci said today.   Such arms sales not only improve the security of friendlynations such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan but help cementrelationships that provide the United States diplomatic leverage,Carlucci said.   The sales also do not threaten Israel, he said, adding theadministration's critics fail to think through the implications forthe Jewish state of being surrounded by Arab nations relying onnon-American arms.   ``Some in Washington, and on Capitol Hill in particular, haveexhibited a lack of realism _ indeed, a strategic confusion _ aboutthe why and wherefore of U.S.-Arab defense relationships,''Carlucci said, addressing the American-Arab Affairs Council inHuntington, W.Va.   ``Various interest groups and many in Congress have sought toimpede virtually every administration initiative to providereasonable and responsible military assistance to our Arabpartners,'' he continued.   ``As a result, Great Britain, France, China the Soviet Union andothers are moving into the highly-desirable positions of confidenceand influence which America has traditionally enjoyed with friendssuch as Jordan and Saudi Arabia. We need a new sense of realism inWashington about the strategic purposes of our policies in theMiddle East ...''   The text of Carlucci's remarks was released by the Pentagon inadvance of his appearance.   The defense secretary expressed optimism about peace prospects,despite the current violence between Israelis and Palestinians onthe West Bank and the failure of Secretary of State George Shultz'sshuttle diplomacy.   Carlucci said he found heartening the cease-fire between Iranand Iraq and the Russian withdrawl from Afghanistan. He said healso had seen signs that radical revolutionary fervor in the regionwas waning.   ``People want capable, productive government, stability andeconomic prosperity. For this, they need peace,'' Carlucci declared.   Real progress can only occur at the bargaining table, hecontinued, with all sides participating in direct negotiations.   ``I am convinced that most Arab states are willing to live inpeace with Israel, but are themselves continually threatened byradical forces in the region,'' he said. ``That is why I believethat moderate Arab states must be strong enough to resistintimidation and take the bold steps to negotiate peace withIsrael.''   Congress, by blocking the sale of arms to Arab nations,undercuts ``a key to our ability to broker the peace process,''Carlucci continued. And to make matters worse, Israel is notthreatened by such deals, he insisted.   ``Israel must regard non-American arms in the hands of itsneighbors as a higher risk,'' Carlucci said.</TEXT></DOC>
