He pulled out a camera during the flight and took his ownpicture. Next day, the photo was on front pages across the country.   It was a stunt typical of Collor, whose vigorous, media-consciousstyle has charmed many Brazilians and irritated others since hisinauguration in March.   At 40, he is Brazil's youngest president. He is the first since1960 to be chosen by popular vote.   Collor arrived like a whirlwind in Brasilia, a placid inlandcapital run for a generation by generals and bureaucrats.   Brazilians have watched him soar through the air in anultralight, race along back roads on a black motorcycle, zip overwater on a jet-ski and glide beneath it in a submarine. He hasbicycled, kayaked, jogged, swum and worked at karate, soccer andvolleyball.   A note from President Bush to a former ambassador, published inRio newspapers, referred to the Brazilian leader as ``IndianaCollor.''   When the president recently announced plans to go skydiving, hismother thought it was too much.   ``Everyone, please, write him letters; ask him to stop,'' LedaCollor de Mello said in an interview on government radio. ``I'm asworried as you are.''   Her son changed his mind and ruled out skydiving.   Last week, a gasoline-soaked pile of illicit cocaine andmarijuana exploded in flames when he dropped a torch on it. Hecovered his face and retreated, suffering a singed right ear, hairand forearm.   Critics say the ``media events'' reflect a shallow populism aimedat the poor millions who are Collor's chief supporters.   ``Collor governs by creating spectacular events,'' Rep. JoseGenoino, of the leftist Workers Party, said in an interview. ``Hepresents the image of a strong president in contrast to a weaksociety.''   Jair Meneguelli, president of the 12 million-member CentralWorkers Union, which supported leftist candidate Luis Inacio Lula daSilva in the December election, described the presidential outingsas ``a stupid recourse to call attention to himself.''   Collor, a black belt in karate, wrote in an article for Veja,Brazil's largest newsweekly: ``I've always had a passion for sports.Today I'm in a position where I have to set an example.''   A similar style has been evident throughout his political career.   When campaigning for local office in his poor home state ofAlagoas in northeastern Brazil, where political assassination is notuncommon, Collor would beat his chest at rallies and defy the hired``pistoleiros'' of his adversaries to shoot him.   At the presidential inauguration in March, he dismissed hisdriver and made the 5-minute trip from the presidential palace toCongress on foot. He strode down the Esplandade of Ministries withCabinet members struggling to keep pace.   Every Friday, he crosses the street in front of the presidentialpalace to mingle with well-wishers, much to the discontent of hissecret service guards. In the crowd, Collor signs autographs, shakeshands and receives kisses and slaps on the back.   To make sure stores were obeying a price freeze he imposed, thepresident dropped in at a Brasilia supermarket and pushed a shoppingcart through the aisles.   At the produce section, he stopped and snapped at the startledmanager: ``These potatoes are rotten. Remove them at once!''   He wrote a check for the $28 worth of food he bought, and gavethe bag to a boy who was begging outside the store.   All agree Collor is a master of television. His good looks,elegant suits and measured baritone are perfectly suited to it.   ``TV is the great instrument of communication in Brazil, where 20percent of the people are illiterate and only 10 percent havecompleted the eighth grade,'' political scientist Helio Jaguaribesaid in an interview.   Collor froze $115 billion in bank and money market deposits,changed the currency from cruzados to cruzeiros and invited thepress along when, to encourage savings, he opened an account withthe equivalent of $100.   ``It's all a show,'' Genoino said. ``It comes from hisauthoritarian concept of government _ a charismatic leader witheverything centered on himself.''   Allegations of authoritarianism increased after Collor introducedhis economic plan by decree March 16 and told legislators not to``tamper'' with it.   ``He is a little emperor,'' sa1nd Meneguelli, the labor leader.``He tried to sit on Congress, and then was forced to back off toavert an explosion.''   Some see Collor's style as a throwback to the classic LatinAmerican caudillo, or populist leader.   ``Latin America unfortunately swings between caudillos anddictatorships,'' Genoino said. ``Multiparty politics still doesn'texist. It's part of our backwardness.''   Others feel Collor has accurately read a public desire for anactive, decisive president.   ``He is exercising his authority, but is not authoritarian,''Jaguaribe said. ``There's a difference. Brazilians like that,because the previous government showed very little authority.''   Jose Sarney, Collor's predecessor, was widely seen as weak andincompetent. His unpopular administration blamed for annualinflation of 4,000 percent.   ``A comparison seems inevitable,'' said Claudio Humberto Rosa eSilva, press spokesman for Collor. ``We have a young, handsome,athletic, courageous and competent president. ... He replaced onewho was ugly, short, old (and) cowardly.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tuesday June 12</NOTE></DOC>
