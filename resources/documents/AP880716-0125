TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than seven months of Palestinian riots andstrikes have turned Israelis hawkish, but the hardline often masksambivalence about the future of the occupied lands and the army'suse of force.   Israeli defensiveness stems from a belief that the occupiedterritories, especially the Jordan River's West Bank, are uniquelybound to the state of Israel.   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the armed forces chief of staff, said theWest Bank and Gaza Strip were not distant battlefields like Algeriawas for the French or Vietnam for the Americans.   ``There is no debate among the soldiers. They know that, by andlarge, this problem is inside our own house, and there is no onewho can take charge of the situation and solve it but the army,''Shomron told the Foreign Press Association in Jerusalem.   Some critics, however, fear Israelis are becoming callous aboutthe violence in which more than 200 Palestinians have been killed,at least 1,500 wounded and 5,000 jailed since Dec. 8.   ``Society has been brutalized,'' said Dedi Zucker, parliamentmember from the liberal Citizens Rights Movement. ``We can see itin the army, in the police, even in the way our children talk. Ithink we all have become accustomed to a higher level of violence.''   On the other hand, Avner Shaki, a hawk recently elected head ofthe National Religious Party, defends the Israeli army.   ``Are we angels? Is there any nation that would have been, percapita, more noble or moral than we have been, taking intoconsideration all the terrorism that surrounds us?''   Zucker, who has emerged as an outspoken critic of thegovernment's ``iron fist'' approach to suppressing riots, saidinitial Israeli public reaction was low-key because many remainedunaffected.   ``People in Tel Aviv just heard about the troubles on TV atnight,'' he said in an interview. ``The bulk of society succeededin ignoring developments in the West Bank. The reason is they didnot pay a price.''   But they may be starting to pay a price and all parties agreethe Palestinian uprising has become the No. 1 issue in the campaignfor national elections Nov. 1:   _Four Israelis (as opposed to more than 200 Palestinians) hadbeen killed by the end of June, and the an estimated 425 soldiersand Israeli civilians have been injured, most lightly by stonesthrown by protesters.   _Minister of Economy Gad Yacoubi estimates Israel's losses fromthe uprising at mid-May totalled $500 million, most in lost touristbusiness and increased security costs.   _The government increased the annual military reserve duty from40 to 62 days annually, a decision felt in nearly every Jewishhousehold.   While life 60 miles from the West Bank in Tel Aviv is largelyuntouched, many more civilians walk the streets of Jerusalem withautomatic pistols clipped on their belts.   Moshe Weiss, the Interior Ministry official in charge of gunlicensing, said 200,000 Israelis were authorized to carry firearmslast year and the number grew by as much as 20 percent since thePalestinian riots, with many more denied permits.   ``There is a drift to the right,'' said Hannoch Smith, a leadingIsraeli pollster.   He added in an interivew that polls of 1,200 Israelis inDecember and March indicated the number who supported Israel'sharsh measures jumped from 51 percent to 74 percent.   Shaki, whose National Religious Party is an ally of PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc, said at his Tel Aviv homeriots had strengthened Israeli resolve to keep the occupied land.   ``We are going to be firmer in our decision to keep in our handsas much as we can of Judea and Samaria,'' he said, using thebiblical names for the West Bank.   But polls also indicate some trends in public opinion favorableto the liberal Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.   Smith said Israelis' support for Labor's idea of giving up landfor peace was the highest in a decade with 48 percent in favor, 41percent against and 11 percent undecided. This was a 7 percent jumpto the favorable side in six months, he said.   Polls by Smith and the rival Dahaf organization also found amajority of the public ready to talk with the Palestine LiberationOrganization if it recognized Israel and renounced violence.   ``The public is saying: put down the unrest by all meansnecessary and then think about negotiating,'' said Smith.   Many Israelis acknowledge, however, they have ambivalentfeelings about the riots and strikes. Even liberal advocates ofterritorial compromise tend to change their views when they put ona military uniform or have family and friends attacked bystone-throwing mobs.   Rafael Moses, a psychiatrist, linked the defensive reaction tothe Holocaust, the slaughter of 6 million Jews by the Nazis inWorld War II.   ``The sensitivity of the Israelis to being attacked, provokedand criticized connects to the Holocaust at times,'' he said.   He added, however, that such sensitivity did not guarantee Jewswould sympathize with the plight of the Palestinians.   Amia Leblich, dean of social sciences at Hebrew University inJerusalem, said the unrest has polarized Arabs and Jews.   ``I think the Arab students here, for example, are morewithdrawn, more segregated,'' she said, noting groups representingthe 1,200 Arabs in the 18,000-member student body refused offers ofpublic dialogue or joint academic projects.   Shlomo Gazit, former head of military intelligence, saidIsraelis may seek to lessen dependency on Palestinians, importingforeign labor to replace striking laborers.   ``Psychologically, there is a very strong realization that isnew in Israel that coexistence with an Arab population literally isnot possible under the present circumtances,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs July 20</NOTE></DOC>
