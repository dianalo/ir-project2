At the same time, inflation has reached double digits.Officials are warning that failure to meet governmentspending targets will weaken the Philippine peso and drive upinterest rates, further threatening capital investment.</LP><TEXT>   Since taking power in 1986, President Aquino has pointedwith pride to the revival of the Philippine economy, whichhas grown 5% to 6% anually the past two years.   But failure to invest in new generating equipment, alongwith a drought on Luzon island, has brought about a criticalelectricity shortage. The government has announced a powerrationing program affecting more than 300 public and privatecompanies.   The energy crisis has already begun to take its toll bydiscouraging foreign investors. Philip Chien, president ofthe Taiwan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in thePhilippines, told the Business Star newspaper that mostTaiwanese investors here have decided to relocate. Taiwan hadbeen the fastest-growing source of foreign investment herethe past three years.   Mr. Chien said some Taiwanese were willing to wait a fewmonths to see if the electricity crisis would ease, but headded: &quot;We don't think it will stabilize.&quot;   He said government plans to purchase gas turbines toincrease generating capacity would probably drive upelectricity rates too high.   Meanwhile, Manila is awash in rumors that militarydissidents, responsible for a failed coup in December, arepreparing for a new bid to topple Mrs. Aquino.   Despite the arrests of several key figures in the Decembercoup attempt, most of the suspected core group of plannersremain at large.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos warned that publicdiscontent over rising prices and the power crisis mightencourage another coup attempt.   The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, has advisedAmericans not to travel to eight areas in the Philippinesbecause of continued problems of crime and insurgency. Atleast eight Americans have been killed in communistinsurgency-related incidents in the country in the past fouryears.</TEXT></DOC>
