DRISCOLL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Livestock futures prices advanced Friday on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange as traders jockeyed their positions before thegovernment released its cattle-on-feed report.   On other markets, oil futures moved higher for the fourthconsecutive day, wheat was higher while corn and soybeans declined,and Treasury bonds retreated sharply.   The cattle-on-feed report, released by the AgricultureDepartment after the close of trading, was not far off from whatwas expected.   The data probably will be only slightly bearish for the nearbyApril and June contracts, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in Chicagowith Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   The survey of seven leading cattle states indicated that therewere 6 percent more cattle on feed as of March 1 than a yearearlier. The number of animals placed on feed during February was 5percent fewer than 12 months ago, while the marketings was put at 3percent above the year-ago figure.   Because the distant contract months are at a substantialdiscount to the nearby deliveries, traders will be inclined to sellApril and June deliveries and buy the back months, Levitt said.   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .22 cent higher with thecontract for delivery in April at 73.77 cents a pound; feedercattle were .10 cent to .32 cent higher with March at 82.12 cents apound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .40 cent higher with Aprilat 46.20 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lowerto 1.65 cents higher with March at 55.80 cents a pound.   Oil futures prices advanced for the fourth consecutive day onthe New York Mercantile Exchange.   Friday's advances were a continuation of a rally begun near theclose of the previous session after OPEC President Rilwanu Lukmanannounced he'd have something to say next Tuesday about stabilizingprices, said Nauman Barakat, a analyst in New York with SmithBarney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   ``My feeling, though, is that they won't do anything butcontinue to talk up the market for a couple weeks,'' he said.``After that, the seasonal demand for gasoline will pick up and soOPEC won't have to do anything to shore up prices.''   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 13 cents to 30 centshigher with the April contract at $16.58 a barrel; heating oil was.52 cent to .83 cent higher with April at 45.05 cents a gallon; andunleaded gasoline was .16 cent to .39 cent higher with April at45.99 cents a gallon.   Treasury bond futures plunged sharply on the Chicago Board ofTrade, responding to what analysts said were renewed fears ofinflation.   Thursday's balance of trade figures helped the dollar and thebond market initially, but further examination of the data gave themarkets a different view, said Jack Barbanel, an analyst in NewYork with Gruntal andamp; Co.   Inflation fears came not only from the trade data, he said, butalso from the rising CRB Index, which was partially influenced bythe $1-a-barrel gain by oil over the last four sessions.   Treasury bonds lost 1 9-32 points, with the June contractsettling at 91 1-32 points.   Wheat futures prices advanced while soybeans and corn skiddedlower on the Chicago Board of Trade.   ``Wheat was about the only market that showed any strength,''said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   Soybeans dropped about a nickel a bushel despite heavy buyingagain Friday by a large speculator who triggered a strong rally onThursday.   Friday's buying by the C andamp; D Commodities was accompanied byheavy selling of soybean options, negating any strong response byother traders, said Lespinasse.   He said beans were under pressure from selling by South Americaninterests and by traders unloading contracts before the weekend.   Increased farmer selling overnight weakened the corn market.   A rumor that the Agriculture Department was about to make anannouncement of a large offer of subsidized wheat helped thatgrain, said Lespinasse.   After the close, the USDA said it offered the Soviet Union 1million tons of wheat.   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with the Marchcontract at $2.99 a bushel; corn was { cent to 1 cent lower withMarch at $1.98 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 3} cents higherwith March at $1.96 a bushel; and soybeans were 3\ cents to 6 centslower with March at $6.20 a bushel.   Precious metals futures posted gains on the Commodity Exchangein New York.   Gold was 30 cents higher with the April contract at $445.20 atroy ounce; and silver was 6 cents to 6.1 cents higher with Marchat $6.365 a troy ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
