During the development,a scale-up scheme based on decomposition and assembly was adopted consistently,and 1,100 kW plant, nearly a practical plant, was constructed only throughelemental investigation and simulation. However, this scheme involvedproblems concerning difficuties in selecting appropriate elements andevaluating the influence of each element on the entire system. The possiblemeasures for cost reduction include the use of a larger and lighter heliostat,generation of higher-pressure, higher-temperature steam, and optimizationof the plant configuration.
