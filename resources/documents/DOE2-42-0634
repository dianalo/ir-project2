This edition is subdivided into eleven sections, eachdealing with a specific type of reservoir data. Maps are presented showingoil and gas pools, production and disposition areas, well spacing areasand other related information. Of considerable importance are sectionswhich provide reservoir data and reserves for all provincial oil andgas pools broken down by unit and non-unit areas. A listing of oil andgas units provides such information as operator, producing zone, numberof active wells and project data such as pattern type, commencement dataand injection rates. The section titled Development Data presents informationon natural depletion mechanism, enhanced recovery projects, well spacingand target areas for all Saskatchewan oil and gas pools. The remainingfive sections include illustrations of typical producing well logs, poolpressure data, Maximum Permissive Rate factors, gas plant performanceplots and formation water resistivity measurements. The reserve valuescontained in this annual are established reserves, defined as those reservesrecoverable under current technology and present and anticipated economicconditions, specifically proved by drilling, testing or production, plusthat judgement portion of contiguous recoverable reserves that are interpretedto exist from geological, gephysical or similar information with reasonablecertainty.</TEXT></DOC>
