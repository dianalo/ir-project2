<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-88-0465 </DOCNO><TEXT>The design and operation of a versatile microreactor capable of studyingthe rates of both steady-state and batch heterogeneous reactions on awire, a foil or a single crystalline surface at pressures between 10{sup-7} and 1000 Torr are described. The residence time distribution of themicroreactor was characterized in order to evaluate the validity of usingthe continuous stirred tank reactor approximation to calculate reactionrates. Absolute reaction rates have been measured for both the catalyticdecomposition of NH{sub 3} and ND{sub 3} and the NH{sub 3} + D{sub 2}exchange reaction over a polycrystalline platinum wire. The measuredkinetics of the NH{sub 3} + D{sub 2} exchange reaction were employedtogether with adsorption-desorption parameters of NH{sub 3}, N{sub 2}and H{sub 2} to develop a mechanistic model that describes the reactionrate over the entire (wide) range of conditions studied. Steady-stateabsolute reaction rates are reported also for the catalytic decompositionof NH{sub 3} on the Pt(110)-(1 x 2) single crystalline surface at pressuresbetween 1 x 10{sup -6} and 2.6 x 10{sup -6} Torr and at temperaturesbetween 400 and 1000 K. The decomposition of CH{sub 3} {sup 13}COOH at7 x 10{sup -4} Torr on a polycrystalline platinum wire at temperaturesbetween 300 and 900 K was examined in the microreactor. The major reactionproducts on the initially clean surface are {sup 13}CO, CO, {sup 13}CO{sub2}, H{sub 2} and adsorbed carbon-12. The catalytic dehydration of aceticacid to ketene was investigated over a graphitized polycrystalline platinumsurface at pressures between 8 x 10{sup -7} and 7 x 10{sup -4} Torr andtemperatures between 500 and 800 K. Reaction kinetics are reported forthe determinations.</TEXT></DOC>
