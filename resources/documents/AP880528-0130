Boolall, of Mauritius' Foreign Ministry, said Prime MinisterAneerood Jugnauth ordered the delegation to walk out of the session.   Conference sources said the Comoros Islands and the Seychelles,two other Indian Ocean islands, also protested the summit'sadoption of an OAU Liberation Committee report expressingembarrassment and concern at their growing trade ties with SouthAfrica.   Thirty heads of state attended the OAU's 25th anniversarycelebrations and its 24th summit in Addis Ababa, the organization'sheadquarters.   OAU Secretary-General Ide Oumarou of Niger said the finalresolution criticized those African nations that do not borderSouth Africa and whose economic relationship with thewhite-dominated government was ``voluntary and deliberate.''   He said the organization was not being hypocritical in notciting the countries whose geographical proximity to South Africanand colonial heritages have forced their economies to be integratedinto that of South Africa.   Black Africa does about $1 billion a year business with SouthAfrica, most of it covert. The summit established a committee toinvestigate that.   It also asked the OAU secretariat to report on the financialcost of opening a Washington D.C. office to back effortsencouraging passage of a U.S. bill supporting economic sanctionsagainst South Africa.   The OAU member countries repeated longstanding calls for theUnited States to use its influence with Pretoria to ensure thespeedy implementation of U.N. Resolution 435, calling for acease-fire and referendum in Namibia, which South Africaadministers.   The summit also said it would work toward convening a U.N.Security Concil meeting to ``examine the totality of racist SouthAfrica's reprehensive policies and acts of state terrorism in SouthAfrica, Namibia and the region.''   The OAU discussed the $12 million owed by 34 member states tothe organization's fund for the support of liberation movements.   A resolution urged that the members owing money, some of whichhave never contributed, to clear their debts within two years ``toenable national liberation movements to intensify the armedstruggle in Namibia and South Africa.''   President Moussa Traore of Mali, newly-elected chairman of theOAU, told reporters the pan-African body will continue to pursueits call for a unified front of the African National Congress, themain guerrilla movement fighting white domination in South Africa,and the much smaller Pan Africanist Congress, which are fightingSouth Africa's government.   Under South Africa's system of apartheid, the nation's 26million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The 5 millionwhites control the economy and maintain separate schools, districtsand health services.</TEXT></DOC>
