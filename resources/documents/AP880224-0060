The most common barrier cited for disabled people was lack oftransportation and difficulty in getting to the polls, problemsnoted by 29 percent of the respondents. Twenty-one percent said itwas difficult to stand or walk.   The telephone poll of 536 disabled people nationwide, conductedin June and July 1987, found that 53 percent said they followgovernment and public affairs most of the time.   In comparison, only 26 percent of all U.S. adults pay attentionto politics much of the time, according to a 1984 National ElectionStudy by the University of Michigan.   The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
