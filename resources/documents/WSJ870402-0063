The copyright law indisputably prevents the copying of a computer program line-by-line or simply translating it into another computer language. At issue in this and other lawsuits is whether the law also prevents the writing of a new program that imitates the look and feel of a copyrighted program -- such as the way the screens appear to a user, or the order in which they appear.    Judge William C. O'Kelley upheld the validity of a copyright held by the maker of Crosstalk on &quot;the placement, arrangement and design&quot; of words on a certain computer screen display. Mirror uses a nearly identical display; its maker argued that such a display isn't eligible for copyright.    Crosstalk, which carries a list price of $195, is sold by a unit of Digital Communications Associates Inc. of Alpharetta, Ga. &quot;The court has validated our contention that the user interface and the appearance of a product is . . . protectable by U.S. copyright law,&quot; a Digital spokesman said.    Mirror, with a list price of $69.95, is sold by closely held Softklone Distributing Corp. of Tallahassee, Fla. Howard Huff, Softklone's president, said the company will rewrite its software to eliminate the screen in question -- one of 125 different screens in Mirror -- and begin selling a new version by April 15.    The impact of the decision on other &quot;look and feel&quot; suits, including one brought by Lotus Development Corp. against two small companies that sell clones of Lotus 1-2-3 software, wasn't immediately clear. Lawyers for each side in that case said Judge O'Kelley's ruling bolsters its position.    The look-and-feel cases are generating controversy in the industry. Companies bringing the suits say they are defending the rewards due those who develop innovative software from companies that are selling cut-rate copies. But others argue that new software always borrows from the old. They say Lotus, if its suit succeeds, will stifle innovation and discourage the spread of standards that help computer users master software made by different companies.    Judge O'Kelley's decision underscores both the complexity of the look-and-feel dispute and the evolving interpretation of copyright law. In 1986, the makers of Crosstalk registered separate copyrights for the underlying computer code and for the screen display in question. Judge O'Kelley upheld the validity of the copyright on the appearance of the screen, but said, &quot;Copyright protection of a computer program doesn't extend to screen displays generated by the program.&quot;    Lotus, which registered a copyright on its underlying computer code for the 1-2-3 software, unsuccessfully attempted earlier this year to register the design of its screens separately. The U.S. Copyright Office told Lotus, &quot;Absent any conclusive judicial guidance, we currently believe that textual screen displays . . . are covered by the (copyright) registration for the program.&quot;    The federal judge in Boston that is hearing Lotus's lawsuit will be asked to resolve the conflicting interpretations.    An attorney for Lotus said Judge O'Kelley ruled that screen displays consisting of words are eligible for copyright, a key issue in the Lotus suit against Mosaic Software Inc. and Paperback Software International Inc. &quot;If they (the makers of Crosstalk) won, we should win,&quot; he said.    But Thomas Hemnes, who represents Mosaic, disagreed, citing Judge O'Kelley's ruling that copyrights on computer programs don't cover the screen displays the programs generate. If Lotus hasn't a copyright on the screen display, it hasn't any case against Mosaic, he argued. </TEXT></DOC>
