The 27 animals grazing on a ranch at nearby Tanleon are theproduct of 18 years and six generations of genetic manipulation.The smaller versions of the ox-like Brazilian zebu or Brahmaspecies stand 3 feet and weigh 300 pounds.   The experimenters began with a small pair of zebu that weighedmore than a ton each and stood nearly 5 feet tall.   ``Each generation has become about eight inches shorter than theone before it,'' says Angel Castrillon, the local rancher who hasconducted the minicow experiment since its start. ``We have createda genetic work that produces almost the same quantity of milk as anormal cow, occupies much less space and uses fewer resources,'' hetold a visitor.   People working on the project believe the mincows will enablemany densely populated, land-poor countries to start or upgradetheir cattle industries.   Ten minicows can graze on less than three acres of land, thearea one normal cow generally requires. Those 10 minicows produce2,970 pounds of meat, about 330 pounds more than the one big cowwould.   Horses and other animals have been reduced in size in otherparts of the world, Castrillon said. But, he said, ``what surprisedus was that the minicows are producing three of four liters (aboutone gallon) of milk a day, compared to the six liters (about 1.5gallons) that a normal cow produces.''   Castrillon, whose ranch is in the fertile ``Huasteca'' region ofnorth central Mexico, first proposed the idea to Manuel Berruecos,a geneticist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, at aMexico City conference.   The rancher said he suggested doing the opposite of what animalbreeders traditionally do: instead of producing bigger and heavierspecimens, why not make them smaller, on the model of the bonsaitrees in Japanese gardens?   ``Unfortunately we have the theory and the prejudice that thebigger things are the better,'' Berruecos said in an interview inMexico City. ``We want to make everything bigger, but the worldisn't growing. Our project may seem like science fiction, but weare close to a world that perhaps will have to adopt these (typesof) measures.''   To achieve the smaller species, experimenters selectedprospective breeding candidates with small heads and cross-bred toachieve smaller offspring.   In the laboratory, Berruecos works to weaken and eventuallyeliminate altogether large-growth genes in the herd's semen.   Berruecos, who holds a doctorate from the University of NorthCarolina, claims that ``in terms of quality, our experience showsno difference in the milk or the meat.''   Field specialists from West Germany, Japan and the United Statesare watching the experiments with interest. In fact, Castrillonsaid one American offered $1 million to take over the research, anoffer he said he rejected.   Castrillon's ranch is home to 15 adult minicows and a dozenoffspring. Another three are under care of the veterinary facultyat the national university.   ``The minicows are gentle, but also very strong. They come closeto you and strongly nudge your legs,'' said Anabella Castrillon,the rancher's wife.   The researchers' next step?   ``We're planning to cross the tiny zebus with the Jersey type,which is small and the best milk producer,'' Castrillon said.   He said he will continue cross-breeding until he produces thetiniest possible species with maximum productive efficiency.   ``We're thinking that this species would be about 2 feet tall.''</TEXT></DOC>
