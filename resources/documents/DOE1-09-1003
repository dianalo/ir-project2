The recent trend of magnetism application is asfollows: (1) Application for energy conversion-- magnetic materials areroughly classified according to whether their characteristics are linearor nonlinear. Study aiming at practical use of magnetic materials isbeing conducted in the light of the guideline that magnetic characteristicsshould be improved to reduce iron loss and allow small equipment to bemanufactured efficiently. (2) Application to control elements -- sometypes of amorphous magnetic material containing much copper seems tobe extensively used in the field of control elements. (3) Applicationto measuring elements -- if the performance of magnetic materials forsensors is improved, the practical use of magnetic materials will growin this field. (4) Others, including multi-layer film magnetic materialsand wire magnetic materials -- this field calls for the development ofmaterials which have new forms and characteristics.
