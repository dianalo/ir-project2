The winning ticket was purchased somewhere in the Chicagometropolitan area, which includes the city and surrounding counties.   Mike Wittkowski, a Chicago printer who was a 1984 Lotto winner,held the previous state record of $40 million. The state's biggestjackpot ever was $69.9 million for the April 15 drawing this year.That prize was divided four ways.   Nationally, the biggest single lottery winner was Sheelah Ryan ofWinter Springs, Fla., who won $55.16 million in the Florida lotteryon Sept. 3, 1988. Other jackpots have been larger, but they weresplit by more than one ticket-buyer.   The winning numbers drawn Saturday night were 6, 9, 33, 40, 51,54. In addition to the one person who matched all six, 607 peoplematched five of the six numbers for $2,164.50 and 35,677 peoplematched four numbers for $73.50, said lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem.   The winner will receive an annual payment of about $2.1 millionfor the next 20 years, with the exact amount to be determinedMonday, she said.   Since July 29, when the jackpot was $6 million, no one hasmatched all six numbers, rolling over the prize money each time tothe next week.   Previous Lotto winners have found innovative ways of safeguardingtheir tickets until they can hand them in.   Robert Rucker, who won $2 million in 1984, said he read hisnumbers a dozen times before he started jumping up and down andcrying.   ``That's when you suddenly realize you are holding the equivalentof a suitcase filled with millions of dollars in cash,'' he said.``And it's strictly up to you to protect it for the next 24 to 36hours.''   He put it in a strongbox in his bedroom and invited friends overto have ``strength in numbers.''   Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said her favorite story is thewoman who stuck the ticket in her bra, ``in a plastic bag so shewouldn't sweat on it.''</TEXT></DOC>
