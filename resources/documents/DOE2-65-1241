The dual-fuel power plant isdeveloped by Waertsilae Diesel and it relies on high-pressure injection.The prestudy also considers electric power generation costs for the plantand the market in Finland and in potential purchasing countries. Theprestudy is part of a more extensive development project for gas-dieselpower plants. The aim of the project is to develop a complete gas-dieselpower plant to build in Finland and abroad. The prestudy shows that Waertsilae'snew VASA 32 gas-diesel power plant is more competitive in CHP-productionthan conventional gas-diesel and gasturbines. However, its economy shouldbe improved. The profit, or internal rate, of the investment, which variedfrom 0-4% in alternatives that were studied, is clearly smaller thanthe requirement for investments of this type. In Finland the currentmarket for gas-diesel power plants is small in the area included in thegas network. There are about ten suitable municipalities. In most ofthem only one unit can be considered, the total potential thus amountingto about 100 MW. In fact, the markets for new gas-diesel power plantscan be found elsewhere. The most important market areas for the plantwill be CHP-production and co-generation mainly in industrialized countries,developing countries, technical markets for gas-industry and oil-industry,mere electricity generation in industrialized countries. The economyof the power plant can be improved by raising the coefficient of efficiencywith e.g. a Power-Turbine and by decreasing operation and maintenancecosts through automation. The investment planning, modularity and standardizationof small power plants can also be developed.</TEXT></DOC>
