Systematic studies of hyperfine structures of longseries of isotopes of the same element should therefore provide precisetypical nuclear quantities, the variation of which, all along the isotopeseries, should lead to the emergence of new ideas for establishing morerefined nuclei models. Particular attention should be paid to isotopeshift measurements which could give, in proper conditions, the preciseevolution of the nuclear shape as it is reflected by the nuclear radiusof the charge distribution. As a matter of fact the total isotope shiftquantity represents a combination of three terms: (i) the normal massshift (or Bohr term) which is simply the energy correction arising fromthe fact that the nucleus has a finite mass, it is therefore easy toevaluate exactly; (ii) the specific mass shift resulting from the actionof a dielectronic operator in the hamiltonian, which is not easy to calculate;(iii) the volume shift or field shift which contains the relevant information(2). Fortunately, there are a few arguments in favor of an almost negligiblespecific mass shift in alkali atoms, at least for the heaviest ones (3),so the subject will be limited to these atoms. In any case, hyperfinestructure measurements as well as isotope shift measurements requirehigh resolution techniques in the optical range which are nowadays usuallyprovided by means of tunable lasers, and more specifically by dye lasers.16 references, 17 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
