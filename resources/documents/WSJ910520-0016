A lot of analysts and money managers are braced for stockprices to retreat in the short term. Some figure it will bethe payback for all that bullishness of a few weeks ago.Others think the retreat will be based on economicfundamentals.</LP><TEXT>   But underneath the facade of gloom that has gathered sincelast week lurk lots of long-term bulls -- and by long-termthey mean years, not months. Many market experts areidentifying stocks as the investment of the 1990s. If they'reright -- and it will take patience to find out if they are --a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 5000 by 1995, maybeearlier, is in the cards.   That outlook is based largely on projected increases inpersonal savings rates and expectations of lower inflation inthe years ahead. &quot;Basically, we're talking about the flipside of the excesses of the 1980s,&quot; says Edward Yardeni,chief economist at C.J. Lawrence and an outspoken optimist onthe stock market's long-range performance. He predicts aninflation rate of only 3% annually for the coming decade,with long-term bond yields falling to 5% from 8.3% currently.All these factors, he says, make such once-attractive assetsas real estate and art anathema to investors looking for biggains.   &quot;We have a five-to-10-year deflation problem in realestate, the art market has played out, and on a global basiscapital isn't willing to speculate on real assets,&quot; he says.   Beyond that, demographic trends will make more moneyavailable to the stock and bond markets, which he believeswill be the investment vehicles of choice. Mr. Yardeniestimates that there are 75 million &quot;baby boomers&quot; entering astage of life in which saving will become more important tomost of them than spending. &quot;They're going to want to stashmoney away in the form of financial assets,&quot; he predicts.   A.C. Moore, a portfolio manager at Argus InvestmentManagement in Santa Barbara, Calif., argues that even bondswon't be very attractive in the next few years, leavingstocks as the investment choice &quot;by default.&quot; He says thatinvestors have become hooked on getting double-digit returnson their investments and that stocks will be the only vehiclewith any chance of providing that kind of return.   &quot;Bond yields are well short of double-digit returns,&quot; hesays. &quot;Historically they have only outperformed stocks invery limited periods of time.&quot;   But he cautions that investors shouldn't become soenamored of stocks as the market rises that they forget basicrules of value. He says he's already seeing signs thatinvestors are ignoring traditional valuation benchmarks, suchas price-earnings ratios, and the temptation to do that islikely to grow.   &quot;Stocks are a financial asset; they're not tulips,&quot; Mr.Moore says, alluding to the kind of mania that sometimes haslured incautious investors into big losses. &quot;There's a way tomeasure the value of stocks, and it would be unwise to ignorethose values.&quot;   No problem, says Stefan Abrams, chief investmentstrategist at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. While corporate earningshave historically risen at a 6.1% annual rate, Mr. Abrams islooking for earnings increases to soar far above that ratefor the next few years. In fact, while strategists areexpecting 14% growth in profits among companies in theStandard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index for 1992, Mr. Abramssuggests that 20% is a more likely target.   His reason: U.S. companies are lean and mean, afterseveral quarters of cutting costs sharply ahead of aneconomic slowdown that most of them saw coming. &quot;They movedquickly and aggressively to remove head count and to takewrite-offs and to do the divestitures of businesses that werenot performing,&quot; Mr. Abrams says.   Now, as the economy muddles through a recession, it'sdifficult to see the effects of those cutbacks, he says. Butwhen demand picks up next year, expenses will stay undercontrol while profit margins skyrocket.   However, skeptics abound. Predicting the stock market'slong-range performance is fraught with pitfalls, says HughJohnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. &quot;Irealize that there are some positive forces that suggeststocks would be the investment of choice over the long term,&quot;he says, &quot;but it's oversimplified. A lot can go wrong betweennow and then.&quot;   He says one potential impediment to a surging stock marketis the high debt levels that will continue to be a drag onthe economy for years. &quot;If the economic recovery is going tobe anemic, it's hard for me to make a case that stock pricescan go to 5000,&quot; he says.   Another problem is that the stock market historicallytends to follow a pattern in which a decade ofoverperformance is followed by two decades of lacklusterperformance. The 1920s, 1950s and 1980s were clearly thedecades of overperformance, he says. &quot;The rhythm of themarket and common sense suggest that we're going to havesomething less than exciting in the stock market of the1990s,&quot; he concludes.   Still, even he can't rule out a big surge in stock prices.&quot;I don't discount the possibility that we could have a periodof speculation that borders on lunacy,&quot; he says. &quot;But youcan't predict that something like that will occur.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          A surging bond market left share prices limping along withmodest losses.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 7.38 points to2886.63 in active trading. Volume on the New York StockExchange totaled 174,210,000 shares. Declining issues on theBig Board were ahead of gainers, 813-684. For the week, theindustrial average lost 33.54 points, or 1.15%.   A late rally in bonds failed to prompt any interest instocks, though the bond market's slide earlier last week wasblamed for the stock market's lackluster performance then.Traders said the expiration of stock index futures had littleeffect on prices.   Technology stocks were mixed. International BusinessMachines fell 3/8 to 103 3/4, Hewlett-Packard was up 1/8 to48 1/8, and Compaq Computer, battered earlier by disclosuresthat second-quarter earnings wouldn't meet expectations, wasunchanged at 35 3/4.   Airline stocks posted losses after a Smith Barney analystcut his earnings estimates on three big carriers. AMR, parentof American Airlines, lost 1/8 to 61 1/8, Delta Air Lines wasdown 1 to 69 7/8, and UAL, parent of United Airlines, fell 4to 147 3/4.   Potlatch climbed 1 1/8 on speculation that InternationalPaper is considering a $60-a-share takeover bid. A Potlatchofficial refused to comment. International Paper fell 1/8 to62 7/8.   Lowe's skidded 7/8 to 29 1/8 after reporting sharply lowerfirst-quarter earnings.   Outboard Marine tumbled 3/4 to 12 7/8. Analysts said theoutlook for the marine industry is grim and that OutboardMarine's excess production capacity, high inventories, largeposition in the slow-growth outboard motor market andnegative cash flow make it particularly vulnerable.</TEXT></DOC>
