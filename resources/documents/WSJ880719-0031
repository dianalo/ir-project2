London-based Maxwell, which is controlled by British publisher Robert Maxwell, purchased IBM's Chicago-based Science Research Associates and its units in Australia, Canada and Britain. Science Research also publishes achievement and vocational tests for industrial training programs.    Maxwell, which bases its U.S. operations in Greenwich, Conn., has said that it will expand Science Research's product lines, and use the company to make further acquisitions. Science Research will now operate as SRA/Pergamon, a separate entity within the Maxwell Pergamon Publishing Group unit.    Maxwell, a leading publisher of academic and scientific journals, has been on an acquisition drive to build one of the world's 10-largest media companies, and has become the second-largest printer in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
