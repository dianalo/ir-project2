 Nearly everyone had an opinion or vision as to whereobject-oriented programming would fit in.andP;  Some people wer quite skepticalabout object-oriented programming's value, while others firmly believed thatit would be the next great programming revolution.andP;  The most fascinatingopinions came from the movers and shakers within the object-orientedprogramming industry.andM;Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, is one of the most interesting andapproachable people I have met.andP;  In an industry filled with oversized egosand self-appointed experts, I found Stroustrup's attitude a pleasant changeof pace.andP;  His perspective on programming is that of an applications developerrather than an ivory-tower academic.andP;  And he tells some great stories.andM;C++ was developed to solve a set of problems that could not be adequatelyhandled by the facilities in C.andP;  C++ is a team effort; while Stroustrup hasdone the lion's share of implementing the C++ preprocessor, many others haveparticipated in the language's growth.andP;  As a result, it has many featuresthat have nothing to do with object-oriented programming.andM;One of the interesting opinions Stroustrup expressed was that object-orientedprogramming is being presented in the wrong way.andP;  We have object-orientedprogramming conferences, magazines, columns, and languages, indicating thatobject-oriented programming is considered something special instead of amainstream practice.andP;  Stroustrup would like to see object-orientedprogramming treated like structured programming, as a standard part of theprogrammer's toolbox.andM;Why is object-oriented programming struggling to gain acceptance?andP;  It hasbeen around longer than most people think.andP;  The first languages to supportobject-oriented programming appeared 20 years ago.andP;  Still, it remains a newtechnique, one to be considered, mulled over, and decided on.andM;Object-oriented programming languages have a reputation for being difficultto learn and use, especially for established programmers.andP;  It is said thatbeginners will snap it up much more quickly than their more entrenched andexperienced colleagues.andP;  This notion is contradictory.andP;  It reinforces theidea that object-oriented programming is somehow different from otherparadigms.andP;  This stigma prevents object-oriented programming from beingaccepted.andM;Why is object-oriented programming hard to learn?andP;  Or more correctly, is ithard to learn?andP;  I have yet to run into a knowledgeable programmer who hasdifficulty understanding the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, andpolymorphism.andP;  Humans naturally classify objects in the universe around them,possibly making object-oriented programming one of the most naturalprogramming paradigms.andM;When I use the noun &quot;bird,&quot; people can generalize what I mean withoutthinking about an exact genus and species because &quot;bird&quot; indicates a generalset of characteristics related to a broad range of specific items.andP;  It isn'tthe idea of &quot;object-oriented&quot; that is difficult to understand.andP;  Rather, it isthe programming languages that are causing the confusion.andM;C++ exemplifies this problem.andP;  Take some average C programmers and start themusing C++ without preparation.andP;  After all, isn't C++ just an extension of C?andO;Alas, that view is both too common and simplistic.andP;  Many of the new featurescan change the complexion of a program.andP;  A programmer can quickly get lost ina quagmire of confusion.andP;  C++ is more than an enhancement; it is a newlanguage that completely changes the face of C.andP;  Sure, you can write Cprograms in C++, but then you forfeit all of C++'s potential benefits.andM;In the past few months, I have seen pieces of C++ code appear in the publicdomain.andP;  These fragments have primarily been created by C programmers whohave purchased the Zortech C++ package for MS-DOS.andP;  While many are excellentC programmers, most don't understand C++'s additional facilities well enoughto properly or fully use them.andP;  Understanding the vagaries of object-orientedlanguages requires some education.andM;We have two approaches to learning object-oriented programming languages:develop a new language around object-oriented programming or addobject-oriented programming capabilities to an existing language.andP;  Simula(the original object-oriented programming language), Smalltalk, and Actor areexamples of the former, pure approach, though Actor's creators clearlyintended its C-like syntax to help programmers protect and build on theirinvestment in procedural programming.andP;  C++, Objective-C, and Object Pascalare examples of the later, hybrid technique.andP;  Heated debate rages over whichtype of language is better; both sides have valid points.andM;Jim Anderson of Digitalk Inc., which produces the excellent Smalltalk/Vseries of environments, vented concern at Software Development '89 over someof the opinions I expressed previously.andP;  Specifically, he felt I gaveSmalltalk a short-shrift by characterizing it as less practical than C++.andO;After speaking with Anderson, I decided that he had some valid points inSmalltalk's favor and further explanation and refinement of my opinion werein order.andM;My background is as an applications programmer.andP;  Having worked for bothsoftware companies and in-house data-processing departments, I tend to thinkin terms of producing software for general distribution.andP;  A compiled languageis necessary for that purpose so that a stand-alone, executable version ofthe software can be distributed.andP;  Any time source code needs to bedistributed, you can count on trouble.andP;  Let's look at some of the problemswith Smalltalk from an applications developer's standpoint.andM;Problem 1.andP;  Some joker in the field always thinks he or she can improve yoursoftware.andP;  This programmer proceeds to make changes that cause problems inthe software and then calls you up for help.andP;  Anyone in a user-supportposition knows about this kind of nightmare.andP;  Smalltalk carries the problem astep further by providing source code for the entire Smalltalk environment.andM;Problem 2.andP;  You can't protect source code from being borrowed or stolen.andP;  Inthis highly competitive world, you can't afford to give your competitors theadvantage of being able to study the specifics of how your product works.andM;Problem 3.andP;  Smalltalk is more than a programming language -- it's a completeprogramming environment.andP;  Its unique environment changes somewhat fromplatform to platform.andP;  While the environment can be ported, the developer islimited to the hardware plateforms the Smalltalk environment has been portedto.andM;Problem 4.andP;  Pure object-oriented programming languages have unique syntax.andO;As a result, they can have a steep learning curve since the entire languagemust be learned from scratch.andP;  A hybrid, on the other hand, incorporates theconcepts and lexical structure of the base language.andP;  Programmers experiencedwith the base language can continue to be productive while incorporating theobject-oriented paradigm as they learn it.andM;It may sound as though I believe that pure object-oriented programminglanguages have no place outside special, closed circles.andP;  We haven't heardthe entire story.andP;  Smalltalk and its cousins have some major advantages.andM;Advantage 1.andP;  In its favor, Smalltalk comes with an complete environment.andO;But didn't I just say that the environment is a problem?andP;  Under somecircumstances, it is.andP;  However, the advantages should not be overlooked.andO;Differences between implementations of the Smalltalk environment are minor.andO;Smalltalk's environment is graphic, with built-in classes for windows,drawing, and other complex actions.andP;  With the computing world moving towardgraphic environmens, Smalltalk has a definite leg up on the competition.andM;Advantage 2.andP;  Smalltalk provides an entire set of base classes in sourceform.andP;  A careful programmer can always build on existing classes.andP;  Hybridlanguages rarely include an extensive set of predefined classes.andP;  C++ onlyprovides the stream class, and Object Pascal provides no preformulatedclasses at all.andP;  Having the building blocks already in place can help speeddevelopment.andM;Advantage 3.andP;  Hybrid languages like C++ are heterogeneous paradigm mixtures.andO;The object-oriented programming facilities are tacked onto an existinglanguage.andP;  To maintain compatibility with the original languages, hybridsinevitably end up having some idiosyncrasies.andM;Smalltalk and other pure object-oriented programming languages do not have tocarry any baggage.andP;  In some ways, it's easier to learn them as opposed tohybrids.andP;  With a hybrid language, the experienced programmer must unlearnnotions of how things are done.andP;  Learning object-oriented programming with apure language may be easier since everthing about the language is new.andM;As with everything, we often find grey areas.andP;  Languages such as Objective-Cand C_talk are modifications of existing languages that have some of theadvantages of pure object-oriented programming languages.andP;  In the future, Iwill examine some of these alternatives to see if they offer significantimprovements over existing object-oriented programming languages.andP;  I willalso delve more deeply into Smalltalk, Actor, and Eiffel to show their goodand bad points.andM;Another item of debate concerns the efficiency of object-oriented programminglanguages.andP;  For example, Smalltalk programs are interpreted; interpretedapplications are nearly always slower than their compiled counterparts.andP;  C++is thought to be less efficient than C due to the increased number ofreferences required to access items.andP;  In commercial development, performanceoften makes the difference between a successful product and a bust.andP;  Thislower performance has helped feed the common opinion that object-orientedprogramming languages are slow and inefficient.andM;In my next column, I will examine the efficiency of C++ and Smalltalkcompared to a program written in C.andP;  To test the languages fairly, thebenchmark programs will be written to take advantage of each language'sspecial features and capabilities.andP;  An important goal of this testing is toproduce identical results using different languages.andP;  I will use the ZortechC and C++ compilers along with Digitalk's Smalltalk/V 286.andP;  These are widelyregarded as the best-performing object-oriented language implementations forcurrently available PC-class machines.andP;  Despite my planning, I suspect thesebenchmarks will be quite controversial, as most are.andM;It should also be noted that runtime execution speed is not always the mostimportant factor when determining the performance of a language.andP;  Programmerefficiency is also valuable.andP;  While reusable software components can becreated in languages such as C, object-oriented languages offer bettercapabilities for data abstraction and scope control.andP;  The advantanges ofpolymorphism and inheritance cannot be built into a benchmark; the true powerof these functions can only be shown in the real world.andM;Another question that came up several times at Software Development '89 was,&quot;Is it possible that object-oriented programming is over-hyped?&quot;andP;  In someways, yes.andP;  It is not as major a change in how we think about programming asit is sometimes made out to be.andP;  Anyone who has seriously programmed in thelast few years is already acquainted with concepts such as structured codeand scope control.andM;Object-oriented programming is merely an evolution that provides a morenatural way of performing these functions.andP;  Beginning object-orientedprogrammers need to realize that object-oriented programming is not theend-all of programming; it merely provides another way of getting the jobdone efficiently.andM;The resources available to a budding object-oriented programmer are verylimited.andP;  This is another point Stoustrup and I discussed.andP;  Very few generaltexts have been written on the subject.andP;  Smalltalk has the advantage ofhaving more references because it has been around for more than a decade.andO;For C++, few resources exist.andP;  Of the handful of books available on C++, mostare seriously flawed.andP;  Programmers are often left to their own devices.andM;To anyone working with object-oriented programming, Pd recommend checking outtwo periodicals that have impressed me.andP;  The Journal of Object-OrientedPogramming covers the entire object-oriented programming field and includescolumns specific to C++, Smalltalk, and Objective-C.andP;  For the C++ enthusiast,The C++ Report is an excellent newsletter covering both introductory andadvanced techniques for using the language.andP;  Both publications can becontacted at P.O.
