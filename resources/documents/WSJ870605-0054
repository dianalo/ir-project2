In 1986, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based container leasing company had a loss of $49.8 million, after write-downs. Holders approved a 50% increase in authorized common shares to 30 million from 20 million. Mr. Sherwood said the increase will &quot;give us latitude to convert high-dividend preferred shares&quot; into common. The company has 10.8 million common shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
