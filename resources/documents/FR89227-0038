Explanation.</T3> This publication is a revision of FIPS PUB 127that offers new conformance alternatives, new programming language interfaces,a new integrity enhancement option, clarification and correction of existingspecifications, and additional considerations for use in procurements.This revision supersedes FIPS PUB 127. It does not contain any new requirementsthat would make an existing conforming implementation nonconforming.This publication announces adoption of American National Standard DatabaseLanguage SQL with Integrity Enhancement, ANSI X3.135.1-198x, and AmericanNational Standard Database Language Embedded SQL, ANSI X3.168-198x, asthe Federal Information Processing Standard for Database Language SQL (FIPSSQL). The exact specification is in section 10 of this standard.ANSI X3.135.1-198x is a revision of ANSI X3.135-1986 that specifies syntaxand semantics of SQL language interfaces for defining and accessing SQLdatabases. These interfaces include:_A schema definition langage, for declaring the structures and integrityconstraints of a database._A module language, including SQL statements, for declaring the databaseprocedures and executable statements of a specific database application.The module language specification includes language bindings for programminglanguages COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, or PL/I.ANSI X3.135.1-198x includes an addendum to ANSI X3.135-1986 that specifiesan optional ``integrity enhancement'' feature. This feature includes referentialintegrity constraints, check clauses, and default clauses.ANSI X3.135.1-198x also includes various clarifications and correctionof several errors known to exist in the ANSI X3.135-1986 specification.ANSI X3.168.1-198x specifies embedded syntax for inserting SQL statementsinto application programs. It includes module language bindings for programminglanguages Ada or C, and specifies embedded syntax for inserting SQL statementsinto programming languages Ada, C, COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, or PL/I.The purpose of FIPS SQL is to promote portability of database applicationprograms and programmers among different installations. The standard isused by implementors as the reference authority in developing a FIPS conformingrelational model database management system, with standard programminglanguage interfaces to that database management system. The standard isused by application programmers to help write SQL conforming applicationsand by other computer professionals who need to know the precise syntacticand semantic rules of Database Language SQL.<T3>4.

Objectives.</T3> Federal standards for database management systemspermit Federal departments and agencies to exercise more effective controlover the production, management, and use of the Government's informationresources. The primary objectives of Federal database management systemstandards are:_to encourage more effective utilization and management of database applicationprogrammers by ensuring that skills acquired on one job are transportableto other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of database programmer retraining._to reduce overall software costs by making it easier and less expensiveto maintain database definitions and database application programs andto transfer these definitions and programs among different computers anddatabase management systems, including replacement database managementsystems._to reduce the cost of software development by achieving increased databaseapplication programmer productivity through the understanding and use ofdatabase methods employing standard structures and operations, standarddata types, standard constraints, and standard interfaces to programminglanguages._to protect the software assets of the Federal government by ensuring tothe maximal feasible extent that Federal database management system standardsare technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible withthe installed base.Government-wide attainment of the above objectives depends upon the widespreadavailability and use of comprehensive and precise standard database managementsystem specifications.<T3>9. Applicability.</T3> a. Federal standards for database managementsystems should be used for computer database applications and programsthat are either developed or acquired for government use. The DatabaseLanguage SQL is one of the database management system standards providedfor use by all Federal departments and agencies. The Database LanguageSQL is suited for use in database applications that employ the relationaldata model. The relational data model is appropriate for applications requiringflexibility in the data structures and access paths of the database. Therelational data model is desirable where there is a substantial need forad hoc data manipulation by end users who are not computer professionals,in addition to the need for access by applications under production control.Although this standard does not specifically address interactive databaseaccess through fourth generation languages, the SQL statements specifiedby this standard are appropriate for such use. This standard may be usedto define the syntax and semantics of database access from such fourthgeneration languages.Although this standard does not specifically address distributed databaseapplications, it may be used, along with facilities for remote databaseaccess and/or distributed transaction processing, to access relationalstructured data at remote nodes in a distributed system.b. The use of FIPS database languages is strongly recommended for databaseapplications when one or more of the following situations exist:_It is anticipated that the life of the database application will be longerthan the life of the presently utilized equipment or database managementsystem, if any._The database application is under constant review for updating of thespecifications, and changes may result frequently._The database application is being designed and developed centrally fora decentralized system that employs computers of different makes and modelsor database software acquired from a different vendor._The database application will or might be run under a database managementsystem other than that for which the database application is initiallywritten._The database application is to be understood and maintained by programmersother than the original ones._The database application is or is likely to be used by organizations outsidethe Federal government (i.e., State and local governments, and others).c. Nonstandard language features should be used only when the needed operationor function cannot reasonably be implemented with the standard featuresalone. A needed language feature not provided by the FIPS database languagesshould, to the extent possible, be acquired as part of an otherwise FIPSconforming database management system. Although nonstandard language featurescan be very useful, it should be recognized that their use may make theinterchange of programs and future conversion to a revised standard orreplacement database management system more difficult and costly.d. It is recognized that programmatic requirements may be more economicallyand efficiently satisfied through the use of a database management systememploying a different data model than those provided by the FIPS databaselanguages or the use of a database management system that functionallyconforms to a FIPS database language but does not conform to all otheraspects of the FIPS. The use of any facility should be considered in thecontext of system life, system cost, data integrity, and the potentialfor data sharing.e. Programmatic requirements may be more economically and efficiently satisfiedby the use of automatic program generators or by database access throughother high-level language information processing systems. However, if thefinal output of a program generator or high-level language system is languagethat accesses a relational database, then that language should conformto the conditions and specifications of SQL.10. <T3>Specifications</T3>_10.1 <T3>Adoption of ANSI SQL specifications.</T3> FIPS SQL includes all provisionsfrom ANSI X3.135.1-198x, Database Language SQL with Integrity Enhancement,and ANSI X3.168-198x, Database Language Embedded SQL, with the followingexceptions:a. FIPS SQL does not recognize Level 1 on ANSI SQL or partial conformanceto just DDL or DML. Instead, the FIPS SQL specification is for ``Full SQLconformance to level 2'' as specified in section 3.4 of X3.135.1-198x.b. FIPS SQL does not include PL/I language bindings, since PL/I is nota FIPS programming language.c. FIPS SQL does not recognize conformance solely by ``direct invocationof SQL data manipulation language statements'' as specified in section3.4 of X3.135.1-198x, because that concept is not adequately specifiedin ANSI SQL and implementations cannot be tested for conformance. Conformanceto FIPS SQL requires a Module Lanaguage or Embedded SQL interface to oneor more FIPS programming languages.d. FIPS SQL includes a ``FIPS Flagger'' requirement as specified below.10.2 <T3>FIPS Flagger. </T3>An implementation that provides additional facilitiesnot specified by this standard shall also provide an option to flag nonconformingSQL language or conforming SQL language that may be processed in a nonconformingmanner.a. ANSI SQL allows a conforming implementation to provide facilities beyondthose specified in the standard. The following paragraph appears in section3.4 of ANSI X3.135.1-198x:<ITAG tagnum="21">A conforming implementation may provide additional facilities notspecified by this standard. An implementation remains conforming even ifit provides user options to process nonconforming SQL language or to processconforming SQL language in a nonconforming manner.</ITAG>The FIPS Flagger is included in FIPS SQL in order to assist applicationprogrammers in developing portable application programs. It allows informeduse of implementor extensions when they are appropriate (see paragraph9c).b. The FIPS Flagger is intended to effect a static check of SQL language.Normally this check is applied at syntax compilation time, but for interpretedSQL language it can be enforced when the SQL language is interpreted bythe impelementation. There is no requirement to detect extensions thatcannot be determined until execution time.c. An implementation need only flag SQL language that is not otherwisein error as far as that implementation is concerned. An implementationmay choose to check SQL language in two steps; first through its normalsyntax analyzer and secondly through the flagger. The first step produceserror messages for nonstandard SQL language that the implementation cannotprocess or recognize. The second step produces flagger messages for nonstandardSQL language that it could process. Any such two-step process should betransparent to the end user.d. Any SQL language that violates Format or Syntax Rules, except privilegeenforcement rules, is an extension and must be flagged.e. The granularity of extension detection shall be no coarser than at thestatement level. If a system is processing SQL language that contains errors,then it may be very difficult within a single statement to determine whatis an error and what is an extension. However, if an implementation isprocessing SQL language that contains no errors as far as that implementationis concerned, then it should be able to detect and flag all extensionsat the same time.f. In order to provide upward compatibility to its own customer base, orto provide performance advantages under special circumstances, a conformingSQL implementation may provide user options to process conforming SQL languagein a nonconforming manner. If this is the case, then it is required thatthe implementation also provide a flagger option to detect SQL conforminglanguage that may be processed differently on that implementation. Thisflagger feature allows an application programmer to identify conformingSQL language that may perform differently if moved from a nonconformingto a conforming SQL processing environment.g. In certain circumstances (see paragraph 9c) an application programmermay choose to use a nonstandard language extension provided by an implementation(e.g. a COMPLEX data type for FORTRAN applications). It is required thatthe flagger detect all direct occurrences of such extensions. In addition,it is desirable that the flagger or the implementation provide support(e.g. a cross-listing of variables and database identifiers) for detectingall secondary references to such extensions. Secondary references may includevariables, parameters, views, or other database identifiers that do notthemselves violate syntax rules, but refer to an object that is or containsan extension. This additional feature would allow an application programmerto identify all SQL language occurrences that may have to be modified ifthe application is to be moved from a nonconforming to a conforming SQLprocessing environment.11.<T3> Implementation.</T3> Implementation of this standard involves threeareas of consideration: acquisition of FIPS SQL implementations, interpretationof FIPS SQL, and validation of FIPS SQL implementations.11.1 <T3>Acquisition of SQL Implementations.</T3>a. This publication is effective immediately. It is a revision of an existingFIPS that offers new conformance alternatives, a new integrity option,clarification and correction of existing specifications, and additionalconsiderations for use in procurements. It does not contain any new requirementsthat would make an existing conforming implementation nonconforming. Nodelayed effective date or transition period is necessary.b. Relational model database management system acquired for Federal useshould implement FIPS SQL. Conformance to FIPS SQL should be consideredwhether SQL implementations are developed internally, acquired as partof an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used underan ADP leasing arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programmingservices.11.2 <T3>Interpretation of FIPS SQL. </T3>NIST provides for the resolution ofquestions regarding FIPS SQL specifications and requirements, and issuesofficial interpretations as needed. All questions about the interpretationof FIPS SQL should be addressed to: Director, National Computer SystemsLaboratory, ATTN: Database Language SQL Interpretation, National Instituteof Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Telephone: (301) 975-2833.11.3 <T3>Validation of SQL Implementations.</T3> A suite of automated validationtests for SQL implementations is currently available. It is planned thatan enhancement of this test suite will be the basis of a future ``certificateof validation'' offered to implementations claiming conformance to thisstandard. For more information on SQL validation tests, or availabilityof certificates of validation, contact: Director, National Computer SystemsLaboratory, ATTN: Software Standards Testing Program, National Instituteof Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Telephone: (301) 975-3258.12. <T3>Waivers.</T3> Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads ofFederal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal InformationProcessing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate suchauthority only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b)of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when:a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishmentof the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, orb. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is notoffset by Governmentwide savings.Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the informationdetailed above. Agency heads may also act without a written waiver requestwhen they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot bemet. Agency heads may approve waivers only by a written decision whichexplains the basis on which the agency head made the required finding(s).A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classifiedportions clearly identified, shall be sent to: National Institute of Standardsand Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, RoomB-154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899.In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authorityto approve waivers shall be sent promptly to the Committee on GovernmentOperations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on GovernmentalAffairs of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipmentand/or services, a notice of the waiver determination must be publishedin the <T3>Commerce Business Daily</T3> as a part of the notice of solicitationfor offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made afterthat notice is published, by amendment to such notice.A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approvingthe waiver and any supporting and accompanying documents, with such deletionsas the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552(b),shall be part of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.13. <T3>Special Procurement Considerations.</T3> FIPS SQL includes variousalternatives for interfacing to programming languages, specifies ``integrityenhancement'' as an optional component of the standard, and does not specifyany minimum requirements for the size or number of occurrences of databaseconstructs. Any invocation of this standard in a procurement should indicatethe programming languages to which it interfaces, whether direct invocationof SQL statements is required, whether module language, embedded SQL, orboth are required for each language, whether the optional integrity featureis to be included, and what the sizing and occurrence requirements are.Any use of this standard in a broader database management system (DBMS)procurement should be accompanied with functional requirements for otherDBMS components and facilities.13.1 <T3>Integrity enhancement feature.</T3> References to this standard ina procurement should indicate whether or not the ``integrity enhancement''feature (an optional component of X3.135.1-198x) is required. Failure tomake this indication means that the feature is not required.13.2 <T3>Programming language interfaces.</T3> References to this standard ina procurement should indicate which programming languages (e.g. Ada, C.COBOL, FORTRAN, or Pascal) are to be supported for language interface.Failure to make this indication means that support for any one of theselanguages satisfies the FIPS SQL requirement.13.3 <T3>Style of language interface.</T3> References to this standard in aprocurement should indicate, for each programming language identified above,whether the language interface is to support Module Language, EmbeddedSQL, or both. Failure to make this indication means that support for anyone interface style satisifies the FIPS SQL requirement.13.4 <T3>Interactive SQL. </T3>References to this standard in a procurementshould indicate whether or not ``direct invocation of SQL statements''is required and, if required, which SQL statements are to be directly invocable.Failure to make this indication means that direct invocation of SQL statementsis not required. A requirement for direct invocation of SQL statementsthat fails to identify which statements are invocable means that interactiveavailability of the following statements satisifies the requirement:<ITAG tagnum="15">CREATE TABLE statement</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">CREATE VIEW statement</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">GRANT privilege statement</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">INSERT INTO statement</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">SELECT statement, with ORDER BY instead of INTO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">UPDATE statement: searched</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">DELETE statement: searched</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">COMMIT WORK statement</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ROLLBACK WORK statement</ITAG>In Interactive SQL, if a statement causes an exception resulting in a non-zeroSQLCODE, then the system shall display a message indicating that the statementfailed and should give a textual description of the failure. Also, in InteractiveSQL, an implementation shall provide some implementor specified symbolfor representing null values.13.5 <T3>Sizing for database constructs.</T3> References to this standard ina procurement should indicate minimum requirements for the precision, size,or number of occurrences of database constructs. Failure to make this indicationmeans that the values detailed below are by default the minimum requirements.<ITAG tagnum="38">Length of an identifier</ITAG>.....18<ITAG tagnum="38">Length of Character type</ITAG>.....240<ITAG tagnum="38">Decimal precision of NUMERIC type</ITAG>.....15<ITAG tagnum="38">Decimal precision of DECIMAL type</ITAG>.....15<ITAG tagnum="38">Decimal precision of INTEGER type</ITAG>.....10<ITAG tagnum="38">Decimal precision of SMALLINT type</ITAG>.....5<ITAG tagnum="38">Binary precision of FLOAT type</ITAG>.....20<ITAG tagnum="38">Binary precision of REAL type</ITAG>.....20<ITAG tagnum="38">Binary precision of DOUBLE PRECISION type</ITAG>.....30<ITAG tagnum="38">Columns in a table</ITAG>.....100<ITAG tagnum="38">Values in an INSERT statement</ITAG>.....100<ITAG tagnum="38">Set clauses in an UPDATE statement</ITAG>.....20<ITAG tagnum="38">Length of a row (see Note 1)</ITAG>.....2000<ITAG tagnum="38">Column specifications in a UNIQUE constraint</ITAG>.....6<ITAG tagnum="38">Length of UNIQUE constraint (see Note 1)</ITAG>.....120<ITAG tagnum="38">Column specifications in a GROUP by clause</ITAG>.....6<ITAG tagnum="38">Sort specifications in an ORDER By clause</ITAG>.....6<ITAG tagnum="38">Table references in an SQL statement</ITAG>.....10<ITAG tagnum="38">Cursors simultaneously open</ITAG>.....10<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note 1.</T4>_The length of a collection of columns is defined to bethe sum of: twice the number of columns, length of each character column,decimal precision plus 1 of each exact numeric column, binary precisiondivided by 4 plus 1 of each approximate numeric column.</ITAG>13.6 <T3>Character data values.</T3> The set of character values for the characterdata type and the collating sequence of characters in SQL are both implementor-defined.References to this standard in a procurement should indicate any additionalcharacter data requirements. For example, applications running in a specificprogramming language environment may wish to specify that the SQL charactervalues coincide with the character values and the collating sequence ofthat programming language. Failure to indicate specific character set requirementsmeans that support for representation of the 95-character graphic subsetof ASCII (FIPS PUB 1-2), in an implementor specified collating sequence,is by default the minimum requirement.13.7 <T3>DBMS procurement.</T3> Database software is normally purchased as acomplete package called a database management system (DBMS). A DBMS isan implementation of one or more data models (e.g. the network model orthe relational model), together with other components, features, or datainterfaces for efficient data administration. These additional facilitiesare not specified by this standard, so each procurement should itself specifythe functional requirements of each additional feature desired.Additional facilities most often contained in a DBMS package include: schemamanipulation, dynamic SQL, system catalog tables, special data types (e.g.date, time), database import and export tools, data dictionary, data storagespecification, natural language query, report writer, query by forms, menudriven data access, application development system, graphics display, orupload and download between mainframes and workstations. Emerging specificationsfor an expanded SQL database language in ANSI and ISO standardization bodiesmay result in future standardization for some of these facilities; othersmay always remain implementation specific.A DBMS may also provide additional data structures, such as indices, orsoftware, such as query optimizers, to enhance performance. User requirementsfor monitoring database activity or tools for tuning database performanceshould be specified explicitly.Some database management systems must operate in a highly secure environmentthat requires ``trustworthy'' database access control beyond the GRANTprivilege facility and the VIEW definition capability specified in thisstandard. Procurements for systems that operate in these environments shouldinclude explicit additional requirements that must be supported.13.8 <T3>Integration. </T3>In many cases a database or a database managementsystem must be integrated with other information processing systems operatingin the same environment. Examples of other sytems might include: the operatingsystem, document processing systems, engineering CAD/CAM systems, graphicssystems, an information resource dictionary system, statistical analysissystems, a transaction processing system, or an artificial intelligencesystem. In addition, distributed data under the control of different vendor'sdatabase management systems may require integration into a coordinatedglobal view through remote database access or open distributed processing.All such integration is beyond the scope of this standard and, if desired,must be specified explicitly as part of procurement requirements.14. <T3>Where to Obtain Copies.</T3> Copies of this publication are for saleby the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,Springfield, VA 22161.
