Bishop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GNE </CO><IN> PHA </IN><TEXT>   Genetic engineers welded two human genes together, transferred them to bacteria that produced a hybrid protein with enhanced cancer-fighting activity.    The hybrid protein was the product of the gene for interferon, a protein the body naturally produces to fight viruses and cancer, and the gene for tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, another natural human protein that has anti-cancer effects.    The genetic engineering trick was pulled off by researchers at Genentech Inc. in San Francisco, and at Indiana University in Bloomington.    In human cancer patients, genetically engineered versions of the proteins each have shown some benefits in some patients but the results have been far short of expectations. One type of genetically engineered interferon, called alpha interferon, is marketed by Schering-Plough Corp., Madison, N.J., and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. for a certain type of leukemia. TNF, which is being produced by several biotechnology companies including Genentech, is still considered experimental. Hoffmann is the U.S. unit of F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co. of Switzerland.    The Indiana scientists asked Genentech researchers to try to fuse the two proteins into a hybrid after experiments showed that when used in combination the two proteins seemed synergistic. That is, they had a greater effect on test-tube grown cancer cells than would be expected from simply adding the effects seen when each protein was used alone.    To get the hybrid protein the Genentech scientists trimmed a nonactive end off both the human interferon and TNF genes and spliced them into adjacent spots in a bacterium's genetic apparatus. The hybrid interferon-TNF protein churned out by the bacterium was just as effective against viruses as interferon alone, showing the hybrid retained its interferon activity, the scientists reported in a recent issue of Science, the weekly scientific journal.    The hybrid protein had even greater effects on laboratory cancer cells than was expected from the earlier experiments using the proteins in combination. This suggests the hybrid is affecting the cancer cells in a way different than the proteins normally act.    The enhanced anti-cancer effect was seen at very low dosages of the hybrid, noted Indiana biologist Milton Taylor. This suggests the hybrid may be useful in humans, particularly since the use in humans of both interferon and TNF is limited by severe side effects.    However, Dr. Taylor said, it's not known how the human immune system would react to such a strange, unnatural protein as the hybrid. Thus, extensive animal tests need to be done before it's known whether the hybrid would be useful in treating human cancer. </TEXT></DOC>
