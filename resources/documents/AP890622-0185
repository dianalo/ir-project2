Baker III appealedto members of Congress on Thursday to back the measured response ofthe Bush administration to abuses of human rights in China, and theHouse responded with a unanimous show of support.   But Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell of Maine calledfor a more forceful renunciation of the executions being carried outdespite an appeal by President Bush to Chinese leaders to showclemency.   Mitchell, in a floor speech, said he understood ``the delicatesituation in which the president finds himself.'' And, the majorityleader said, ``I support the stated desire to maintain, if possible,some relationship with the Chinese government.''   But, Mitchell said, ``I ask _ I urge _ the president to condemnthese acts personally and in the strongest possible terms, to givevoice to the feelings of the overwhelming majority of the Americanpeople.''   Bush, meanwhile, told a luncheon in New York City ``we're allvery concerned'' about developments in China. Later, White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the president against Mitchell'scharges.   ``We feel the administration has spoken out loudly, strongly andwithout reservation on this issue,'' Fitzwater said. ``We've spokenout forcefully, more than any other country in the world. Our wordsspeak for themselves. There's no need to repeat different wordsevery day of the week.''   Asked specifically to react to the latest wave of executions,Fitzwater said, ``There's a great sense of sadness anddisappointment that world opinion has not had an influence on theactions of the Chinese.''   Twenty-seven people reportedly have been executed in China.Thousands have been arrested as authorities extend their crackdownon advocates of a more liberal communist system.   Baker, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee,said the United States was first among the countries around theworld to respond to the assault on students June 3-4 in TiananmenSquare.   ``What we have done is to take carefully targeted actions withoutbeing inflammatory in our rhetoric and preserving options for thefuture,'' he said.   That approach, Baker said, ``doesn't necessarily extend toothers.''   But while he recognized Congress might want to take a differentstance, Baker said ``in the past when we have not spoken with onevoice in the conduct of our foreign policy we've almost alwaysfailed.''   Therefore, Baker urged Congress to bank its fire and recognizethat the U.S. relationship with the People's Republic of China,carefully cultivated over the past 15 years, had otherconsiderations besides human rights.   ``I think we should act and speak in one voice, and act in acoordinated way to address this very, very difficult foreign policyproblem,'' he said.   The House later voted 416-0 for a non-binding resolutioncondemning the ``murderous crackdown and brutal repression of thepro-democracy movement'' and supporting Bush's call for clemency fordemonstrators.   ``This is an issue on which there is no disagreement in thisHouse or among the American people,'' said the measure's sponsor,Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``It is essential now for usto tell the Chinese government that there can be no business asusual as long as they continue brutal repression of their ownpeople.''   Before the vote, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., toldreporters, ``I would like to see the Congress and the presidentstand together on these issues, and I do not favor actions thataren't taken in consultation with the administration.''   Foley added that ``the stand that has been taken is very clear''and said additional sanctions could lead to ``a complete breach'' inU.S.-China relations while having no positive effect.   ``That will not accomplish anything that I can see for thebenefit of the democracy movement in China, or for the individualrights of Chinese students, and I think we ought to keep someconcern about the maintenance of the relationship.''   Bush's initial response to the shootings in Tiananmen Square wasto suspend U.S. military transactions and contacts with China. Then,as the suppression continued, he withheld U.S. support forinternational loans to Beijing and prohibited visits by senioradinistration officials.   ``I believe we have made it abundantly clear, both what we saidand in our actions, that while they may be able to clear the Squarethey won't be able to clear their conscience,'' Baker said of theChinese leaders.   Mitchell, citing fresh news reports that seven more ``rioters''had been put to death, said Bush was more reticent than other worldfigures in denouncing the Chinese government.   The senator said the leaders of Britain, Australia, New Zealand,France and Japan had made statements more forceful than Bush, whodeplored the attack in Tiananman Square and said he admired theprotesters.   ``I ask him not to refuse to answer questions about thesematters,'' Mitchell said, ``but to step forward voluntarily to speakout. ... I urge the president to assume the proper role as thespokesman for the American people, as the leader of the free world,to condemn these actions in the strongest possible terms.''   Baker said his view had been misunderstood as protective only ofU.S. economic and commercial ties with the world's most populousnation.   Actually, he said, U.S. policy must consider geopolitical ties.``There are countervailing considerations,'' he said.   Baker was confronted by calls from members of the committee forthe administration to go beyond the sanctions imposed against Chinato stronger measures and more consistent denunciation of arrests andexecutions.   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., said he and other lawmakers wereplanning to propose a package of sanctions against China tougherthan Bush's suspension of military and diplomatic visits and U.S.arms transactions.   Solarz, who met this week with Chinese Ambassador Han Xu, did notelaborate.   Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., urged Baker to keep in mindNeville Chamberlain, the pre-World War II prime minister of Britainwhom many historians accuse of pursuing a failed policy ofappeasement toward Adolf Hitler.   Rep. John Miller, R-Wash., said he was exhilarated by theadministration's ``splendid performance.'' But he advised Baker todenounce the executions with an outrage that `'the Chinese and thepeople of the world would hear.''   Two senior members of the committee, Reps. William S. Broomfield,R-Mich., and Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind., supported the administration'sapproach.   Broomfield said the president was doing his job properly, andHamilton told Baker, ``I think you have handled the China problemvery well.''   Vice President Dan Quayle, meanwhile, said the United States``would respond appropriately if China halts repressive actions thatare souring its relations with the West.''   In a speech to an Asian Policy Conference sponsored by theHeritage Foundation, a conservative research organization, Quaylesaid the United States has a duty ``to denounce the brutalsuppression of popular and peaceful demonstrations in China ... tocondemn the Orwellian inversion of truth'' about the slaying ofcivilian demonstrators in Beijing.</TEXT></DOC>
