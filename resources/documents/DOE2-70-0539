All of oil and natural gas are produced in Cretaceousand Tertiary sedimentary basins on the continental margin off the coastof Ivory Coast and Ghana. In 1970 the first oil field (Belier) was discoveredby the test boring drilled under the sea, and in 1980 Espoir Oil Fieldwas discovered. No further new oil field, however, has been discoveredsince then. The total production until 1987, amounts to 45.55 millionbbl and the minable reserve is estimated about 84 million bbl. The productionreached the maximum 1984, and thereafter has gone down. Few plans ofprospecting are carried out recently. (10 figs, 2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
