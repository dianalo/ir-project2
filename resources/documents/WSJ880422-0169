The provisions would boost the taxes of corporations and individuals by billions of dollars. But they haven't caused much of a stir because they are buried in popular measures for new government benefits, such as one that would provide health insurance to elderly people who suffer catastrophic illnesses. In this election year, at least some of the increases are likely to pass.    The tax increases under consideration include provisions that would phase out a child-care tax break for high-income families and impose a surtax on Medicare recipients.    In addition, the House will vote, perhaps next month, on legislation that would make all personal income subject to a portion of the federal payroll tax, a measure that would raise about $6 billion a year. Currently, individual annual income over $45,000 is exempt from the tax.    Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) of the Senate Finance Committee defended the inclusion of these tax increases as the responsible way to pay for new government expenditures. &quot;In this time of budget deficits, it's important to keep revenue neutrality,&quot; he said.    &quot;It's the beginning of a trend,&quot; said Rep. Brian Donnelly (D., Mass.), who refers to the measures as &quot;tax bills in bits and pieces.&quot;    At least five separate pieces of legislation contain tax increases. These are the trade bill, the catastrophic-health-care bill, a bill that would provide long-term care insurance for the elderly and disabled, a bill giving taxpayers greater protection in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service and a bill that would overhaul the welfare system. The tax increase provisions in each of the bills are designed to cover at least some of their cost.    The catastrophic-health-care bill is likely to include a provision that would eventually impose a surtax of at least 25%, as much as $1,000 a person, on the tax liability of Medicare recipients. The Senate version of the bill would make the size of the surtax flexible, depending on the projected cost of the program.    The troubled trade bill would impose a small, new fee on all imports. This fee could raise as much as $636 million a year based on last year's import figures. The fee, which the Reagan administration views as a tax, is intended to pay for a retraining program for workers who lose their jobs because of imports.    Next month the House may vote on a bill that would establish federal insurance to cover long-term health care at a cost of about $5 billion a year. That cost would be more than covered by the proposed elimination of the limit on the amount of personal income that is subject to a portion of the federal payroll tax. Under the bill, which has an uncertain fate in the Senate, all individual income would be subject to the 1.45% tax that goes to pay for Medicare. The entire payroll tax, most of which goes to finance Social Security benefits, totals 7.51% this year. It is paid by both employers and employees.    In addition, a welfare overhaul bill, a version of which passed the Finance Committee this week, would phase out the dependent-care credit for high-income families, among other tax-law changes.    Congressional tax writers carefully are avoiding any major single piece of tax legislation this year. The one tax bill that has emerged so far is the Senate Finance Committee's so-called taxpayer bill of rights, which would relinquish federal revenue by, among other things, relieving farmers and others of the need to pay taxes for diesel fuel used off the road. To pay for these provisions, the bill would accelerate the payment of certain corporate estimated taxes and also double the &quot;gas guzzler&quot; excise tax on certain luxury cars. </TEXT></DOC>
