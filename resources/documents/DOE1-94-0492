<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-94-0492 </DOCNO><TEXT>A calculation has been made of the distribution of tidal torques actingon matter in the neighbourhood of local density maxima when the densityperturbations are small. It is found that high peaks experience highertorques than low peaks. The higher torques acting on the high peaks arecounteracted by the shorter collapse time during which the torques canact. Which effect is dominant depends on the perturbation power spectrum:for power spectra characteristic of both cold dark matter and hot darkmatter, the effects nearly cancel, and the total angular momentum acquiredby a collapsing object is almost independent of the height of the peak.Furthermore, the distributions of angular momenta acquired by collapsingprotosystems are extremely broad, for all power spectra; the range ofangular momenta of peaks of a given height far exceeds any modest systematicdifferences between peaks of different height.</TEXT></DOC>
