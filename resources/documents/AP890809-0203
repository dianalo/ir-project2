The action came two days after five Central American presidentsagreed on a plan to demobilize the Contras within four months.   Israel Galeano, the rebel chief of staff known as ComandanteFranklin, was among the officers filing claims at the Miami officeof the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.   The officers denied there was a connection between theirapplications and the accord signed Monday by five Central Americanpresidents in Tela, Honduras, calling for the dismantling ofNicaragua's anti-Sandinista forces.   ``We're doing this errand to facilitate our struggle,'' saidFrancisco ``Johnny'' Delgadillo, a political adviser on thesouthern front who also was granted asylum.   Galeano said the Contra leaders have no plans to move to theUnited States, telling The Miami Herald that the officers soughtnothing more than ``travel documents.''   ``Some of us have the need right now to mobilize in theinternational field,'' Galeano said. ``There is a need to getdocuments to travel.''   Delgadillo admitted the action could be misinterpreted by theestimated 12,000 rebel troops languishing in border camps.   ``It could be demoralizing to the troops if we were seen asretiring from the struggle,'' Delgadillo said. ``But the troopsknow that's not so. Our struggle continues.''   He voiced bitterness at the Honduras agreement. ``We don't wantto live like slaves to the signature of the presidents,'' he said.``We want to go on being rebels.''   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega declared that the plan spellsthe death of the rebel movement. The Sandinista government agreedto democratic reforms leading up to national elections in returnfor the repatriation or resettlement of the Contras by Dec. 8.   The Bush administration, which lobbied to keep the Contrasintact as a fighting force until Nicaragua's February 1990elections, has reluctantly embraced the five presidents' accord.Congress cut off military aid to the rebels in February 1988.   Galeano vowed Wednesday to continue his fight with ``limitlesshuman resources'' and return to the jungled mountains of Nicaraguaif the Contras are kicked out of Honduras.   ``Each government has acted on nothing more than its own selfishinterest,'' he said. ``We're the ones who are paying the price.''   Perry Rivkind, the INS district director in Miami, said theclaims were given ``special action'' status and reviewedimmediately.   ``Because of the nature of their positions and possible securityproblems, we ask that their cases be moved fast,'' Rivkind said.   A complete list of the nine commanders was not availableWednesday, but the names that were known included: Luis AngelLopez, known as Leonel; Jose ``Emmanuel'' Aguilar, a southern frontcommander; and Fremio ``Jimmy Leo'' Altamirano, a northern frontcommander.</TEXT></DOC>
