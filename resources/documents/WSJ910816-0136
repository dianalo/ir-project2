Minow</HL><DATE>08/16/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A6</SO><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   Exactly 35 years ago today, on Aug. 16, 1956, theDemocratic National Convention nominated Adlai E. Stevensonas its candidate for president for the second time. As ayoung partner in Stevenson's Chicago law firm, I was workingwith him in his office when he received the news. Heimmediately called in some friends and colleagues for adviceon a surprising and unprecedented proposal: to throw open thevice presidential nomination to the delegates at theconvention.   There was a serious, thoughtful debate for several hoursin Stevenson's office. Many different views were offered. Iwas among those urging that he choose 39-year-old Sen. JohnF. Kennedy as his running mate. But over the strong objectionof senior party leaders, including Speaker of the House SamRayburn, Stevenson went to the convention that same eveningand told the 2,477 delegates and alternates that they wouldchoose his running mate:</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The American people have the solemn obligation toconsider with the utmost care who will be their president ifthe elected president is prevented by a higher will fromserving his full term. It is a sober reminder that seven outof 34 presidents have served as the result of such indirectselection. . . . I have concluded to depart from theprecedents of the past. I have decided that the selection ofthe vice presidential nominee should be made through the freeprocesses of this convention -- so that the DemocraticParty's candidate for this office may join me before thenation not as one man's selection but as one chosen by ourparty even as I have been chosen . . . The choice will beyours. The profit will be the nation's.&quot;   The next day brought a frantic free-forall. Sevencandidates (Estes Kefauver, John F. Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey,Albert Gore, LeRoy Collins, Robert Wagner, Luther Hodges)were nominated. A close contest quickly developed betweenKefauver and Kennedy. On Aug. 17, the delegates finally votedfor Kefauver, 755 1/2 to 589.   Various methods have been followed to choose vicepresidents in the past. The Constitution originally providedthat the person who received the greatest number of electoralvotes, if a majority, became president and the runner-upbecame vice president.   This process was tried four times: in 1788, 1792, 1796 and1800. It was abolished after the confusing election of 1800,when it was unclear for a long time which of Thomas Jeffersonand Aaron Burr would emerge as president and vice president.In 1804, the ratification of the 12th Amendment changed thisprocedure. Electors would cast separate ballots for presidentand vice president, leading to the election of a team, bothof them from the same party.   The vice presidential nomination thus became a bargainingand ticket-balancing device. In 1864, President AbrahamLincoln abandoned his Republican vice president, HannibalHamlin, and selected a Democrat from the border state ofTennessee, Andrew Johnson -- who became president only a fewmonths later. In 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt gave John NanceGarner the vice presidential nomination in exchange for theTexas delegation's support.   In recent years, with the presidential nominee selectedlong before the convention meets, the nominee has been freeto choose his vice presidential candidate, with theconvention rubber stamping his selection. Few Republicans orDemocrats would claim that the results of these choices --William Miller and Spiro Agnew, Tom Eagleton and GeraldineFerraro, for example -- were always the best possible. But wehave sadly grown accustomed to witnessing exhaustedpresidential nominees making 4 a.m. decisions on their own.   Should we go through this process again in 1992? Are therebetter ways to choose nominees for vice president? I suggesttwo alternatives, neither of which would require a change inthe law:   Option One: When a presidential candidate announces hiscandidacy for president, the candidate would also announcehis choice for vice president. Voters who participate in astate caucus, primary or convention would then know theentire ticket they would be voting for.   Option Two: After the presidential nominee has beenchosen, the nominee would present to the convention delegatesthe names of three acceptable running mates. The delegateswould then debate the merits of each of the three, and makean informed and deliberate choice.   Certainly, neither option is perfect. The first isdifficult because top candidates for president are notusually willing to say in advance that they would accept avice presidential nomination. The second is difficult becausepresidential nominees resist sharing their decision-makingwith the delegates.   But I believe both options are better than the presentmethod, and that the second option would be an improvementover the 1956 Stevenson plan. The nominee needs a compatiblerunning mate. In 1956, Stevenson ended up running withKefauver, with whom he had a long but uncomfortablerelationship.   In the 35 years since 1956, two more vice presidents havebecome president by &quot;indirection,&quot; bringing the total to nineout of 42 in American history. The odds are better than 1 in5. Vice President Garner once said: &quot;The vice presidencyain't worth a pitcher of warm spit.&quot; From the vicepresident's standpoint, he was wrong, as Harry Truman, LyndonJohnson and Gerald Ford have shown. He was even more wrong --dangerously wrong -- from the standpoint of the country.   ---   Mr. Minow, a Chicago lawyer, has been a delegate orparticipant at seven Democratic national conventions.</TEXT></DOC>
