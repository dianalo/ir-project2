The major obstacle to sharing defense technology appearsto be U.S. government inertia. Even U.S. officials admit thatthe Defense Department has been slow to make crucialpersonnel decisions, submit specific requests for cooperationto Japan and respond to feelers from Tokyo.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It continues to be a very low priority for the Pentagon,&quot;says Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.), chairman of a SenateArmed Services subcommittee advocating closer U.S.-Japanesecooperation. &quot;The military still has the general attitudethat if it's worth knowing, we pretty much know it here.&quot;   Sen. Bingaman's committee recently tried to jump-start theprocess by authorizing more than $20 million for cooperativeresearch between the two nations. But despite encouragementfrom major U.S. defense contractors, the record is one ofmissed opportunities.   In spite of growing concern about America's dependence onJapan for basic security needs, no new technology transferprojects have been discussed for nearly two years. That iswhen the last meeting of the main bilateral forum overseeingJapan's efforts took place. A session was scheduled for lastmonth, but was delayed, until November at the earliest,officials familiar with the process say.   U.S. defense officials complain that they are preoccupiedwith more pressing matters these days, such as trying tosalvage their budget in the post-Cold War era. But the issueof U.S. technology ties to Japan -- both military andcommercial -- will grow only more urgent.   Recent Defense Department studies have warned of Japan'sgrowing control of crucial military technologies. The flapover the FSX fighter plane last year stemmed from growingU.S. fear that Japan was taking U.S. military technology tobuild its industrial base, while the U.S. was getting littlein return.   Overall, Japan had a 126 billion yen (US$844 million)technology transfer deficit with the U.S. in 1988, accordingto a study released last week by Japan's Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry, or MITI. The same studyshowed that Japan sends 10 times more researchers to U.S.labs than the number of U.S. researchers it hosts. Theministry, sensitive to charges of technology sponging, saysit is drafting policies to encourage Japanese companies toshare their research, patents and licenses.   U.S. military interest in tapping Japan's technologystarted more than a decade ago, as it became clear theJapanese wanted to develop their own independent advancedweaponry. In 1980, the two sides set up the Systems andTechnology Forum. From that came then-Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone's 1983 decision to exempt the U.S. from a post-warban on military exports, and to encourage the flow of&quot;dual-use&quot; technologies, which have commercial and martialapplications.   But since the first official steps toward that goal,efforts by the two sides have generated little more thanpaperwork. &quot;Things didn't happen as I expected at the time,&quot;says Hiroo Kinoshita, who spearheaded Japan's technologytransfer activities in the 1980s at Japan's Defense Agencyand at MITI.   The biggest reason for lack of recent progress appears tobe disarray at the Defense Department. The deputyundersecretary for international programs is officiallyresponsible for such matters, but the post has been filled bya temporary appointee since October. The result, critics say,is that technology-sharing has been left in the lap ofmid-level bureaucrats who lack the clout to get things done.   Many Pentagon officials also say the government, despitemaking general noises about wanting more technology fromJapan, rarely makes specific requests. &quot;If they know whatthey want to receive, they could ask for it,&quot; says Mr.Kinoshita. He notes that &quot;people from DOD have their ownprograms&quot; and &quot;If they allow the transfer of technology fromJapan, it will become unnecessary.&quot;   Many U.S. government officials privately concur. &quot;DOD isreally punting on this,&quot; says one U.S. official closelyinvolved in the process.   Philosophical differences, meanwhile, split the twonations. The Japanese are proposing joint development inspecialized areas where the two nations are probably even,according to U.S. officials. But the U.S. is targeting basictechnologies where the Japanese have a clear lead, with theobjective of getting U.S. companies steeped in thosepractices.   Indeed, many Japanese companies still have &quot;a lingeringreluctance to get involved in a project, particularly if itinvolves any public attention to Japanese technology goinginto weapons development,&quot; says James E. Auer, who recentlyretired from the Defense Department, and now runs a centerfor U.S.-Japan studies at Vanderbilt University.   U.S. companies say Japan is very slow about turning overdual-use technologies, and some U.S. Defense Departmentofficials say they complained last year to MITI that Japanwas blocking such exports.   The FSX agreement, finally signed earlier this year, wasthe first major technology-sharing project. While most of theattention focused on U.S. transfers to Japan, MitsubishiHeavy Industries Ltd. did agree to share a handful of itsproprietary technologies with General Dynamics Corp. Butexperts in both countries believe it was such a painfulprocess that it might damage prospects for major technologysharing.   &quot;With the FSX, we tried to do too much too soon,&quot; Sen.Bingaman notes. &quot;Concentrating on cooperative agreements on asmaller scale,&quot; he adds, &quot;can build trust&quot; while providing&quot;practical economic and military benefits for bothcountries.&quot;   A few smaller-scale projects have been discussed. One ofthe first official projects involving surface-to-air missiletechnology fell apart after Toshiba Corp., the developer, wasblacklisted by the U.S. government for a subsidiary'stechnology sale to the Soviet Union. The Japanesesubsequently did turn over to the U.S. know-how in two casesinvolving naval ship repair.   The last official meeting of the Systems and TechnologyForum was in October 1988, though it was originally supposedto take place every six months. During that session, Japanpresented a list of five technologies it wanted to codevelopwith the U.S. The Americans expressed interest in three ofthe proposals: rocket engines, missile seekers, anddetection-shields for submarines. The two sides haveexchanged notes but have done little work since.   During a February visit to Tokyo, Defense Secretary DickCheney handed the Japanese a list of generaltechnologiescomposite materials, large-scale integratedcircuits, gallium arsenide semiconductors, artificialintelligence, phased-array radar, and genetic engineering --that the U.S. wants better access to. But there has been noofficial followup, U.S. and Japanese officials say.</TEXT></DOC>
