Saw Maung, urged themilitary Monday to continue its struggle against the country'sdozen rebel groups.   On Sunday, government troops overran the main Karen camp of MawPo Kay, in Karen State, located on the border with Thailand. Thevictory came after three days of intense fighting, according toBurma's state radio.   The broadcast said 38 government troops were killed and 189soldiers wounded; at least 74 rebels were killed.   ``The traitors such as the Burma Communist Party rebels ... andthe Karen National Union ... who are lackeys of foreign powers,continue their efforts ... to cause the disintegration of thestate,'' Saw Maung said at a military parade marking Armed ForcesDay.   Saw Maung seized power in a bloody coup in September when histroops killed hundreds of people to crush a nationwide movement fordemocracy.   On Monday, he repeated pledges the military will hand over powerto the winner of a general election next year.   ``With the improvement of the general situation, free and fairgeneral elections will be held throughout the country, except inthe areas where there is no peace and tranquility because of rebelactivities,'' he said.   Burma has been torn by ethnic clashes since gaining independencefrom Britain four decades ago.   The Karens, with about 4,000 fighters, roam vast tracts of thesoutheastern border with Thailand.   Sunday's loss of Maw Po Kay, 80 miles northwest of Raheng,Thailand, was considered a major defeat, sources said. The Karenshad held the camp for several years despite previous governmentoffensives.   Government troops seized rebel weapons and ammunition in theattack, the broadcast said.   The fighting forced the evacuation of 3,000 people from the ThaSong Yang district of Thailand's Tak province, located near thecamp. Government troops captured two other Karen camps along theThai-Burmese border in December and January.   The Karens are one of a dozen minority groups that have soughtgreater autonomy promised to them in Burma's constitution afterindependence was won from Britain in 1948.   The minorities live in Burma's rugged frontier and make up about30 percent of Burma's 38 million people. Most Burmese live in thecentral part of the country.   The lifestyles and traditions of the minorities differ fromthose of the dominant Burmese, who are mainly Buddhist.</TEXT></DOC>
