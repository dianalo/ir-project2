For investors who hope to profit, the rubis that environmental stocks already have been strong formonths.   Nevertheless, some money managers and analysts believethey have identified stocks that will benefit heavily fromthe new law, and that haven't already been bid up to themoon.</LP><TEXT>   Team Inc. looks good to R. Jerry Falkner, director ofresearch at Southeast Research Partners in Boca Raton, Fla.,a unit of Dominick andamp; Dominick. Listed on the American StockExchange, the Alvin, Texas, company specializes in valvemaintenance and repair and monitoring of industrial plantemissions. Those two specialties accounted for about 60% ofTeam's fiscal 1990 revenue of $82 million and will be in keendemand under the new law, Mr. Falkner says.   Despite these hot specialties, Team stock sells for 12times the past year's per-share earnings, a bit below averagein today's market. Mr. Falkner cites the company's erraticearnings history: It had some big losses back in the dayswhen it was mainly an oil-region company transportingdrilling muds.   Mr. Falkner thinks Team will earn at least $1.50 a sharein the fiscal year that started last week and runs throughnext May. He figures that the market will reward Team with anaverage price/earnings ratio (about 15) and that the stock ison its way to 23 or 24. Yesterday it closed at 16 1/4.   Dresser Industries caught the eye of James H. Morgan,president of Morgan Investments in Greenville, S.C., whichholds some of the shares. Best known as an oil-servicecompany, Dresser also has a big engineering and constructionarm. &quot;Along with Fluor, it will be a big participant inreconfiguring refineries to meet the new standards,&quot; Mr.Morgan says.   Dresser, at 52 1/8 yesterday, already sells for more than20 times trailing per-share earnings. But Mr. Morgan also hasa backdoor play that's cheaper. He recommends NorfolkSouthern, a railroad whose route structure, he says, puts itin a position to carry heaps of the low-sulfur coal thatutilities increasingly will need. Norfolk Southern is at 415/8, less than 12 times the past 12 months' earnings.   &quot;I've always looked at {the Clean Air Act} as a naturalgas bill,&quot; says Craig Drill, who runs Craig Drill Capital inNew York. &quot;The thing that wins on every count is natural gas.President Bush has wanted to help the energy industry. Andsince {the oil spill at} Valdez, it's been just impossible.&quot;   The beneficiaries, Mr. Drill says, will be &quot;the people whohave large reserves in natural gas {such as} Unocal, and thepeople who are good at drilling for natural gas, such asParker Drilling.&quot; Unocal sells for about 22 times the past 12months' earnings. Parker has been posting losses, though thelosses have been narrowing.   Ron Barone, analyst at Kidder Peabody, prefers Tennecobecause its gas pipeline &quot;serves the energy-hungry Northeast&quot;and the Midwest, where high-sulfur coal has traditionallybeen used. He expects brownouts in the Northeast, perhaps assoon as this summer. Besides producing less pollution thanother sorts of power plants, natural-gas fired plants can bebuilt quickly, he says. He considers Tenneco attractivelypriced at 15 times recent earnings, or 69 yesterday, andthinks the company may soon sweeten its 4.3% dividend yield.   Richard Sweetnam, analyst at Kidder Peabody, says the&quot;biggest beneficiary&quot; of the new law will be Air andamp; WaterTechnologies. Based in Branchburg, N.J., and listed on theAmerican exchange, the company makes air-pollution controlequipment, scrubbers and monitoring equipment.   When it comes to cleaning the air, says Mr. Sweetnam, Airandamp; Water Technologies is &quot;standing right in the middle of thetracks.&quot; Competitors such as General Electric, Asea BrownBoveri and Air Products andamp; Chemicals are big, diversifiedcompanies, not pure plays, he says. Unfortunately, Air andamp;Water Technologies stock sells for about 38 times theearnings Mr. Sweetnam expects for this fiscal year (ending inOctober) and 20 times the earnings he expects for 1991. Notmuch of a bargain there.   More down-to-earth are producers of low-sulfur coal.Jordan Estra of Oppenheimer andamp; Co. recommends both Nerco andAshland Coal, which sell for 13 and 15 times recent earnings,respectively. Coal producers overexpanded in the energy booma decade ago, Mr. Estra says, and they have been hurting eversince.   But a lot of excess capacity has been shut down. Afterfive years of falling prices (to a recent level of about $28a ton), he expects a rebound to perhaps $30 or $31 a ton overthe next two years. Combine that with continued cost-cuttingand increased production, and patient investors could see anice profit increase, Mr. Estra says.</TEXT></DOC>
