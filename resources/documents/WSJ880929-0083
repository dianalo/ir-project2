Interviews with retailers and vacuum cleaner industry executives indicate that several of Regina's Housekeeper cleaner lines have had high rates of return, bringing into question the company's sales figures. Problems with faulty belts, weak suction, or other flaws have led to return rates as high as 30% to 50% on certain models, some retailers said. Target Stores, a subsidiary of Dayton Hudson Corp., said in the last month it dropped one Regina line because of customer complaints.    Regina's problems surfaced last week when the Rahway, N.J.-based company said it had trimmed earlier sales estimates and expected to report a loss for its first quarter ending tomorrow. On Tuesday, Regina's chairman and almost 40%-shareholder Donald Sheelen resigned, and the company said financial results for its past fiscal year were materially incorrect and had been withdrawn. Its accountants, Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co., are conducting a full audit of the company.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Regina shares rallied a bit, closing at $4.625, up 50 cents. The stock, which traded at $17 last week, has plummeted in recent days on heavy volume.    Regina officials declined to comment on the reported rate-of-return problems and analysts said the company won't talk to them either.    Separately, shareholders filed a suit in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleging that Regina misrepresented its financial condition in the company's annual report. The plaintiffs in the suit, which seeks class-action status, are identified as investors who bought Regina stock between July 19 -- when the company released results for its year ended June 30 -- and Sept. 20, when Regina told analysts that first-quarter results would be lower than expected.    The majority of the return problems seem to be with the Housekeeper vacuum line, which was introduced in 1986 and sells for $59 to $79, and the 1987 Housekeeper Plus line, which sells for about $100 to $150.    At K mart Corp., which accounts for 20% of Regina's total sales, Dennis Dorn, a senior buyer, said that when the stores began selling Regina's Housekeeper 1000 model, the machines' &quot;belts would break, and customers couldn't get replacements.&quot; Combined with other performance problems, one out of every five machines were being returned. That model accounts for about a quarter of Regina machine sales at K mart, he said.    Mr. Dorn said that Regina did improve the Housekeeper 1000 several times and that sales improved. But the old 1000 machine was discontinued last month, he said, and Regina is in the process of introducing a new version. Mr. Dorn added that other Regina lines haven't had such high rates of return.    Hoover Co., a unit of Chicago Pacific Corp., said the return rate on its machines is under 1%. Eureka Corp. officials said the rate is well below 1% for their machines as well. Officials at both companies said a return rate of as high as even 3% would be considered cause for alarm.    A Target Stores spokesman said the 332-store chain discontinued Regina's Housekeeper Plus 5000 line, an updated and more expensive offering than the Housekeeper 1000, after &quot;at least half&quot; were returned. Target still sells several other Regina models.    Industry executives said that Regina last year started an 800-number telephone service, so customers could bypass retailers and go directly to the manufacturer to return faulty machines.    Regina's fiscal 1988 report said inventories and accounts receivable both roughly doubled from a year earlier. In 1988, inventory soared to $39.1 million from $19.6 million. About $17 million of the 1988 inventory was finished goods, the report said, up sharply from about $10 million a year earlier. Sales rose to $181.1 million from $128.2 million. Receivables -- or money owed Regina -- rose to $51 million from $27.8 million. But the fiscal 1988 figures were withdrawn, so they might not be correct.    The ballooning of receivables and inventories, accountants say, can indicate such problems as too many returns, lack of quality control, poor financing arrangements, improper screening of customers for credit-worthiness and poor overall management of vendors and suppliers.    Mr. Sheelen marketed his vacuum cleaners aggressively. In 1988, Regina spent $40 million of its reported $181 million of revenue on advertising.    Mr. Sheelen himself was fond of spilling corn flakes on his floor to demonstrate what he believed to be Regina's superior cleaning ability. Regina's television commercials took a similar tack. One such commercial -- which compared Regina machines to the market leaders -- prompted a federal lawsuit from Hoover, after Mr. Sheelen refused to pull the ads. Regina later backed down when the case was brought before a judge. Mr. Sheelen, of Rumson, N.J., couldn't be reached.    James Flynn, vice chairman and treasurer of Regina, didn't go into the office yesterday, a company spokesman said, adding that he still works there. Messrs. Sheelen and Flynn bought Regina in a leveraged buy-out from General Signal Corp. in 1984 for $31.4 million. </TEXT></DOC>
