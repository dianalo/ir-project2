Each side accused the other of massive fraud.   Fifteen of India's 25 states and five of its seven federallyruled constituencies voted Wednesday. Balloting continues Fridayand Sunday, but no results are to be announced before Sunday night.   Voters will choose 524 members of the Lok Sabha, or House of thePeople, the law-making lower chamber of Parliament. The Lok Sabhawill choose the next prime minister.   Gandhi _ the 45-year-old grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru,independent India's first prime minister, and son of slain PrimeMinister Indira Gandhi _ sought to portray the election as a choicebetween stability and chaos. Only his family's party, he said,could guarantee economic improvement and combat ethnic andreligious tensions.   He was challenged by a five-party opposition coalition known asthe National Front, a loose alliance of parties spanning theideological spectrum and led by former finance and defense ministerVishwanath Pratap Singh. It built its platform on promises ofhonest leadership, accusing Gandhi's government of high-levelcorruption and ineptness.   Opinion polls suggested the Congress Party could lose power forthe second time since 1977, but Gandhi professed confidence. ``Weare going to win,'' he said after casting his ballot.   Preliminary reports after polls closed estimated voter turnoutat 55 percent, about normal.   More than 100,000 paramilitary troops were deployed to bolstersecurity, but reports of violence mounted. Indian electionstraditionally are violent, and the killings brought to 79 the totaldeaths since parliamentary elections were announced Oct. 17.   In Gandhi's Amethi constituency, a remote rural area in northernUttar Pradesh state where Gandhi is seeking re-election toParliament, the prime minister's opponent was roughed up by policewhen he complained of ballot-stuffing. The candidate, Raj MohanGandhi, is the grandson of independence leader Mohandas K. Gandhi.   A local opposition leader, Sanjay Singh, was shot in the armabout three miles from Amethi town, said aides. They claimed thegunman was a Congress Party worker.   Dinesh Goswamy, spokesman for the National Front in New Delhi,alleged police helped Congress Party workers rig a large number ofpolling booths.   Anand Sharm, the Congress Party's chief spokesman, scoffed atthe allegations and accused the opposition of rigging votes.   Three bombs rocked the Kashmir valley near the Pakistan border,where Moslem militants who want to secede from predominantly HinduIndia warned voters to boycott the election. No one was injured.   In the town of Anantnag, militants placed two coffins near apolling station with signs that read: ``Whoever votes will meetthis fate.''   Kashmir election officials estimated voter turnout at less than5 percent.   Violent clashes between Congress Party workers and oppositionsupporters were reported in northern Haryana and southeasternAndhra Pradesh states.   In Uttar Pradesh state, where the Congress Party's traditionallyheavy suppport has been eroded, opposition leaders charged theelectoral roll did not contain the names of many 18-year-oldseligible to vote for the first time.   The Congress Party has ruled India for all but 29 months sinceindependence from Britain in 1947.   Even when the Congress Party was ousted in a 1977 election, theopposition was not nearly as united as the National Front is today.The vote then was considered more a vote against then-PrimeMinister Indira Gandhi and her emergency rule than a vote for theopposition. Mrs. Gandhi returned to power shortly afterward.   Gandhi was swept into office on a massive sympathy vote inDecember 1984, two months after his mother was assassinated.   The initial aura of confidence and optimism inspired by theyouthful Gandhi, a Western-educated former airline pilot, has fadedas allegations of corruption dogged his friends, his party and hisgovernment.   The main accusation stems from newspaper reports that theSwedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors paid up to $50 million inkickbacks to win a 1986 contract to sell India $1.4 billion inartillery guns.   Gandhi denied that any Indian received kickbacks or commissions.</TEXT></DOC>
