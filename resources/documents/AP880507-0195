Shultz, attackingtwo congressional actions, on Friday denounced a new South Africansanctions proposal and called the trade bill ``one of those1,000-page monstrosities.''   At a luncheon honoring former members of the foreign service,Shultz said the two measures were examples of what he called adisturbing new American trend toward insularity.   ``There's an instinct coming out in this country of `stop theworld I want to get off,' but we can't get off,'' Shultz said.   He said an omnibus trade bill passed by Congress that PresidentReagan has vowed to veto would protect American markets at a timewhen the U.S. trade deficit is narrowing and the United States doesnot need to be shielded from foreign goods.   ``It's ironic because we are the biggest exporters in theworld,'' Shultz said.   ``It's one of those 1,000-page monstrosities and you hardly daresay what is in it and what's not in it,'' Shultz said of the bill.   ``United States competitiveness is asserting itself and all themoonshine about how we're flat on our backs and not able to doanything is shown to be just that,'' he said.   In a slap at Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., a dropout in the racefor the presidential nomination, Shultz said, ``I was interested tosee what happened to the candidate for president in the primarieswho made protection his shining light. He didn't get very far.''   ``We can't let voices of discouragement and special interestslead us away from ideas that have worked in the past toward theideas that have failed in the past,'' Shultz said.   The secretary repeated administration assertions that a bill toincrease sanctions to pressure South Africa to end its restrictiveracial policies would be counterproductive because it would cut theUnited States' ability to influence that government constructively.   Shultz said, ``If we see something we don't like we have atendency to say let's get out of there.   ``The instinct of it is to say we don't like apartheid,therefore let's throw up our hands and leave. That's not theAmerican instinct of the old days,'' he said.   Legislation to toughen sanctions against South Africa wasapproved Tuesday by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and appearsto have widespread support in the Democratic-controlled House. Itfaces strong Republican opposition and could undergo changes in theGOP-dominated Senate.   Shultz also railed against foreign aid and operations budgetcuts instituted by Congress over his objections. One of theprograms to be hurt will be U.S. aid to Afghan refugees.   ``Where we're going to find funds for that is beyond me,''Shultz said. ``We're broke. The country's going great, but thegovernment's broke. And our foreign affairs picture is broke.''</TEXT></DOC>
