Total sales of all companies in the group dropped 9.7%, to $23.88 billion from $26.44 billion. All figures are converted at the mark's current exchange rate.    BASF attributed the earnings decline in part to a $194 million third-quarter write-off for oil reserves held by the Wintershall AG unit. The write-off was caused by lower crude-oil prices. The stronger West German mark, meanwhile, contributed to the group's lower sales figure.    The company didn't report fourth-quarter earnings. But a comparison with earlier figures showed group pre-tax profit fell 17% in the fourth quarter, to $264.4 million from $319.9 million a year earlier. Sales dropped 19%, to $5.72 billion from $7.05 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
