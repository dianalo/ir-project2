The group's consolidated sales, meanwhile, are likely to resume their upward movement after stagnating over the past five years, according to Aerospatiale President Henri Martre.    However, Mr. Martre reiterated an earlier projection that the group's profits and losses, excluding minority interests, will be reported nearly in balance for 1987, following group consolidated profit of more than 300 million French francs ($54.4 million) in 1986. The deterioration was due mainly to the dollar's decline, he said.    Aerospatiale is the French partner in Airbus Industrie, the European commercial-aircraft consortium. Last week another Airbus partner, British Aerospace PLC, said it is likely to report that its civil-aircraft division incurred a wider loss in 1987's second half than in the first half, because of the declining dollar. Earlier last week, French Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir said that the lower dollar was a &quot;catastrophe&quot; for Airbus Industrie and will force the consortium to sell its wide-bodied jets at a loss. </TEXT></DOC>
