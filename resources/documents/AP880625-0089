The weekly Ash-Shiraa reported that the agreement to release thehostages emerged during a three-day unofficial visit by fourBritish legislators to Iran that ended Wednesday.   ``Reliable Moslem fundamentalist circles have confirmed thatBritish-Iranian negotiations to free British hostages held inLebanon will result (in their release) on the eve of the Americanpresidential elections,'' the report said.   The magazine gained international fame when it broke the storyof secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in return for releasing Americanhostages in 1986. The magazine's more recent reports on hostagedevelopments have proved inaccurate.   The four British legislators returned to London Wednesday sayingIranian officials offered to use their influence to release thethree British captives in Lebanon.   Ash-Shiraa said the ``Iranian leadersip was seeking to postponethe release until late summer so that it will be the biggest voterin the coming American presidential elections.''   Ash-Shiraa said the Iranian move of postponing the release``aims at besieging and embarrassing the official American stand(of the Reagan administration)'' for failing to obtain the releaseof American hostages.   The United States and Britain had agreed not to negotiate forthe hostages' release. However, France ``negotiated with Iran forthe release of French hostages and that was achieved'' the reportsaid.   French diplomats Marcel Fontaine and Marcel Carton as well asjournalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann were released in Beirut May 4.   Britain's foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, on Thursdaydenied that Britain was negotiating for the release of AnglicanChurch envoy Terry Waite, journalist John McCarthy and teacherBrian Keenan.   No group has claimed responsibility for abducting Waite andMcCarthy, although they are widely believed held by fanatic ShiiteMoslem kidnappers affiliated with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, orParty of God.   The magazine report compared the anticipated release to that ofof 52 Americans held hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran for 444days. They were released on inauguration day as president JimmyCarter left office.   ``The aim of the delay was to bring Carter down and the hostageswere only released after a new president (President Reagan) tookover'' the magazine article concluded.   In all, 18 foreigners are missing and believed kidnapped inLebanon, including nine Americans. The longest held is TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
