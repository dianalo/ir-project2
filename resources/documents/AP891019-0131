Mosbacher said Thursday that Soviet bloc nations must boldlycommit themselves to free market economies if they want to solvetheir dire financial problems.   ``Our hope is to see the Soviet Union and all the countries ofEastern Europe fully integrated into the community of nations, withtheir citizens enjoying the benefits of free enterprise,''Mosbacher said.   Mosbacher was in Frankfurt for a conference sponsored by theInstitute for East-West Security Studies. His remarks came in aspeech prepared for delivery Thursday evening.   The commerce secretary said that much work is necessary beforeEast bloc nations that strengthen their economies.   ``There is no escaping the fact that the East's economicproblems were home-grown, and they can only be solved at home byradical _ and genuine change,'' he said.   Mosbacher added: ``Only the market place, only free enterprise,can solve the desperate economic problems of the Easterncountries.''   The Bush administration official said the leaders of Hungary andPoland are committed to working for a market economy, while ``eachday Soviet leaders come closer.   ``The leaders of the other Eastern economies, though, are stillliving in the past,'' he asserted.   Communist East German leaders, including new party chief EgonKrenz, have called for a strengthening of an orthodox socialiststructure. East Germany has an economy that is the envy of many ofits Soviet bloc neighbors.   Mosbacher also addressed the critical question of financingchanges in Eastern Europe.   ``Competition in production alone is not enough,'' he said.``Independent banks are essential, allocating capital on the basisof markets and interest rates and offering financial services thatwe in the West take for granted.''   Mosbacher, 62, also referred to his own background as amultimillionaire oil company executive.   ``As a businessman, I'm not accustomed to couching my views inthe language of euphemism. I prefer to speak forthrightly,'' saidMosbacher. ``And I'll say what we all know: Marxist economics donot work.''   Among the topics at the East-West security conference Mosbacherwas attending is the integration of the ``reforming socialistcountries into the world economy.'' Other topics include armsreduction and international cooperation.   West German Foreign Minister-Hans Dietrich Genscher and ItalianForeign Minister Gianni de Michelis were among the approximately200 participants.</TEXT></DOC>
