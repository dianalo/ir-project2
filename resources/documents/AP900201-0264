(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It was in 1974 that 3M scientist ArtFry, sitting through a boring church sermon, concocted the idea ofself-sticking, yellow notes that can be removed without a trace,for use in his choir hymn books.   But it took him four years to convince superiors at 3M that thisidea would sell commercially. Two years later, in April 1980,Post-it notes premiered, and America has been stuck on them since.   ``Initial enthusiasm for a piece of note paper with adhesive onthe back wasn't overwhelming,'' Fry said of his battle to persuadesuperiors. ``It was hard to sell the concept that people needed anote pad that would sell at a premium price comparscratch paper.''   Now, a decade after the product hit the market, many Americanswonder how they got along without the yelled to ordinaryow squares they stick toreports, folders, desks, computers, telephones and refrigerators.   3M started with two sizes of Post-it notes: 3 inches by 5 inchesand 1{ by 2, available only in yellow. Today, the company says ithas more than 350 varieties, a range of different sizes and colors,plus many with cartoon characters and messages. There are Post-itnotes specifically made for taking phone messages, marking bookpages and identifying material to be faxed.
