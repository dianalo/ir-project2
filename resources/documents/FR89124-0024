It stated that in orderto be considered an essential person the individual must provide an essentialbenefit or service.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Social Security Act at sections 402 and 406 and the implementing regulationat andSection; 233.20(a)(2)(vi) permit States, at their option, to includein the AFDC grant benefits for ``essential persons.'' Such individualsare not eligible for AFDC in their own right, but their needs are takeninto account in determining the benefits payable to the AFDC family becausethey are considered ``essential to the well-being'' of an AFDC recipientin the family.Twenty-four States currently include the option as part of their respectiveState Plans. A wide variety of individuals are included as essential persons.The definition and categories of essential persons vary from State to State,including the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Unemployed or incapacitated stepparents living in the home with eligiblechildren and the natural parent;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Individuals age 18-21 who are not attending school;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A relative necessary to provide child care or other services becausethe caretaker is incapacitated or employed;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A second natural or adoptive parent living in the home;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The needy spouse of the caretaker relative;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Stepparents who work fewer than 100 hours per month;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_An unmarried individual who has a child in common with the caretakerrelative.</ITAG>Since 1943, Federal policy has recognized the concept of the essentialperson in the AFDC program. Such benefit or service may be provided directlyto a recipient, or provided to someone else in the home so long as thewell-being of the recipient is thereby promoted.The Social Security Amendments of 1967 (Pub. L. 90-248) amended sections402 and 406 of the Act to provide a specific statutory base for an essentialperson policy. The implementing regulations permit States to specify thoseindividuals considered essential. States are also required to provide recipientswith the final decision as to whether individuals are in fact essential.Accordingly, in implementing this provision, the Department has allowedStates to simply identify the categories of individuals considered to beessential in their State plans without requiring them to identify the benefitsor services that such individuals specifically have to provide in orderto be considered essential.In light of recent Congressional amendments to title IV-A of the Act, andsubsequent changes which States have made in their State plans, we havere-evaluated the current regulation. For example: In 1981, Congress amendedsection 406(a)(2) of the Act to exclude students age 19 to 21 from thedefinition of a dependent child. Some States then included such childrencategorically as essential persons, without regard to such individual'sprovision of an essential benefit or service. This is an indication thatsome States are using the essential person provision to circumvent and/oravoid Congressional intent.Three States, in particular, seem to be using the essential person provisionto extend benefits to 19 and 20 year-olds. These States account for anestimated 55 percent of all AFDC essential persons nationwide, but 72 percentof all AFDC essential persons aged 19 and 20 live in these three States.From another perspective, in these same three States, we estimate that45 percent of the 19 and 20 year-olds living in AFDC households who arenot otherwise receiving AFDC benefits as eligible adults, are includedas essential persons. This is in contrast to five other States that explicitlyrequire the provision of essential services, where only an estimated 3percent of 19 and 20 year-olds in AFDC households are included as essentialpersons.Data from the years 1981 and 1982 very strongly suggest that States didin fact shift older children made ineligible by the Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1981 (OBRA) onto the AFDC rolls as essential persons. In 1981, ourdata showed 4,500 cases with individuals over the age limit (for a dependentchild) who were not classified as adult recipients. In 1982, this figurewas 23,000 cases_a fivefold increase. Further evidence that 18 to 21-year-oldrecipients previously considered dependent children were apparently convertedto essential person status in order to obtain additional Federal fundscomes from examining data from two large States. There, the 1982 figurefor the total number of individuals over 18 who were not adult recipientswas very similar to the 1981 number of 18 to 21-year-old dependent children.These two States accounted for about 18,000 of the 23,000 cases nationwide.Today they continue to carry a large number of 18 to 21 year-olds as essentialpersons.These same two States are using the essential person provision to directlyshift the financial burden of State assistance programs to the Federalgovernment. For example, one State specifies that a minor child ineligiblefor AFDC in his own right, but who is eligible for General Assistance,may be considered to be essential. The other State includes eligibilityfor public assistance other than AFDC as a factor in determining essentialperson status. These two States account for approximately 45% of the totalexpenditures for essential persons.In addition to the problems which we identified regarding the categoricalinclusion of broad groups of individuals, the Office of Inspector General,in a recent review, discovered other individual situations where personswho were in no position to provide essential benefits or services to anAFDC family were classified as essential. These individuals included atwo-year-old and a drug addict. In another case, seven individuals wereclassified as essential persons for a single AFDC household.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Regulation</ITAG>Based on these experiences, it is clear that the needs of non-essentialpersons are being covered under the AFDC program as essential persons.Therefore, we are amending the regulation to emphasize that in order tobe considered an essential person, an individual must provide an essentialbenefit or service. In the proposed rule, essential benefits and serviceswere limited to two specific services. We have now expanded the list asa result of public comment to include three other services in additionto the two which were previously listed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 5, 1987, at 52 FR 37184. The completelist of benefits or services which are considered essential are as follows:(1) The provision of child care which enables a caretaker relative to workon a full-time paid basis outside the home; (2) Care for an incapacitated family member in the home; (3) The provision of child care that enables a caretaker relative to receivetraining full-time; (4) The provision of child care that enables a caretaker relative to attendhigh school (or General Education Development (GED) classes) full-time;and(5) The provision of child care for a period not to exceed two months thatenables a caretaker relative to participate in Employment Search or anotherAFDC work program. For purposes of (1), (3), and (4) above, the State is free to define ``full-time.''However, the definition, applicable both to minor and adult caretaker relatives,must be consistent with the definition of full-time that the State usesfor purposes of the earned income disregards at 45 CFR 233.20(a)(11).With regard to (2) above, we note that the requirements for determiningincapacity are similar to those set out at andSection;233.90(c)(1)(iv) fora State to find that a parent is incapacitated for AFDC purposes. Thus,we expect that States would have little difficulty in making incapacitydeterminations.Moreover, to assure the likelihood of success of these policies, we arealso modifying the regulation to require that a member of the State agencysupervisory staff affirm the recipient's choice of essential person andagree, based on the evidence, that the designated individual does in factmeet the definitional requirements of an essential person. For purposesof this determination, a member of the State agency supervisory staff isa person of a higher position or authority than the first line caseworkeror income maintenance intake employee. Since the AFDC and Adult Assistanceprograms are administered in a similar manner, we have added that changeto the Adult Assistance regulation at andSection;233.20(a)(2)(vi) as well.While we are not proposing any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements,we would expect States, pursuant to 45 CFR 205.60(a) and 206.10(a)(9)(iii),to continue to make periodic determinations that individuals included asessential persons meet the definitional requirements for an essential person,and maintain appropriate written documentation in the AFDC case recordof the essential person determination. Appropriate documents might includeitems such as the recipient's request that the individual be included asan essential person, the basis under which the individual was determinedto be an essential person, and information necessary to support the determination(such as information on the nature, regularity, and length of service andon the capacity of the individual to provide such an essential benefitor service). In a case where more than one individual was to be classifiedas an essential person, such as in a case of severe incapacity, the documentationwould have to include justification of the need for more than one essentialperson.In the proposed rule, we solicited comments as to whether a specific regulatorychange to further clarify this policy would be of value. We did not receiveany comments on this issue. As a consequence, no regulatory changes havebeen made to further describe this documentation requirement.Finally, States would still be free to limit essential person status tocategories of individuals, such as grandparents or the needy spouse ofa caretaker, but only if such individuals are actually providing an essentialbenefit or service. Likewise, States may specify a minimum age for classificationof an individual as an essential person.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>Comments were received from 18 interested parties regarding the proposedrule on the essential person provision. The commenters include 12 Statewelfare agencies, 3 County and City welfare agencies, and 3 welfare rightsand legal groups. These comments are discussed below:<T3>Comment:</T3> In the proposed rule, the essential benefits or servicesare limited to (1) the provision of child care which enables a caretakerrelative to work on a full-time paid basis outside the home, and (2) carefor an incapacitated family member in the home. Several commenters madesuggestions for expanding the list of services. Most of their suggestionsfocused on the inclusion of child care so that a caretaker could participatein a work program or attend school.<T3>Response:</T3> Having considered the many services that were recommendedfor inclusion, we have determined that the list of essential services shouldbe expanded. (See ``Discussion of Regulation'' above.) In reviewing thesuggestions for additional services, we considered an important goal ofthe AFDC program; i.e., to promote recipient self-sufficiency by encouragingfamily members to seek employment. As a consequence, we are adding threeadditional services to the two that were listed in the proposed rule whichwill assist AFDC families in achieving that goal. The additional servicesare: (1) The provision of child care that enables a caretaker relativeto attend training full-time, (2) the provision of child care that enablesa caretaker relative to attend high school full-time or attend GeneralEducation Development (GED) classes on a full-time basis, and (3) the provisionof child care for a period not to exceed two months that enables a caretakerrelative to participate in Employment Search or work programs.We have determined that the inclusion of an essential person in the AFDCgrant is permissible in situations (1) and (2) above only when a caretakeris in training or in high school on a full-time basis. This is consistentwith the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposed considering a personwho provides child care which enables a caretaker relative to work on afull-time paid basis outside the home to be an essential person. In addition,the full-time requirement encourages family members to become self-sufficientas quickly as possible. For this latter reason, we have also limited theperiod of time during which an essential person can be included in situation(3) above to two months. We believe that this allows sufficient time tosecure employment, yet discourages extending periods of participation inEmployment Search or a work program indefinitely.Other suggestions for expanding the essential person provision were: (a)To include categorically as essential persons certain groups of individuals(such as stepparents) without documenting that they are providing a specificbenefit or service, (b) to consider as an essential service the provisionof child care that enables the caretaker relative to attend school, training,or work on a part-time basis, and (c) to include individuals who provideintangible benefits (e.g., individuals who by their mere presence in thehome represent family models, promote family unity, provide emotional support,or provide psychological benefits) as essential persons. After due consideration,we reject these suggestions for the following reasons.A determination that a specific benefit or service is being provided bythe essential person must be made in every case. The determination involvestwo parts: (1) The family identifies the person and benefit or servicebeing provided and (2) a member of the State agency supervisory staff concursby affirming the assistance unit's choice of the essential person, andby determining if the individual is needy and if the provision of the benefitor service is essential (i.e., it is included in the list of five essentialbenefits or services identified in ``Discussion of Regulations'' above.)Therefore, to permit states to designate certain categories, such as stepparents,to be eligible as essential persons without documentation that they areproviding a specific benefit or service would negate much of the effectof this regulation and allow individuals who live in the home but who donot provide any benefit or service to be eligible as essential persons.States will continue to be permitted to limit essential persons to categoriesof individuals. Within such categories, those individuals may be includedonly if they provide an essential benefit or service. For example, a Statemay limit essential persons to only grandparents. However, the grandparentwould still have to perform at least one of the essential benefits or servicesin order to be an essential person.With regard to work, school attendance, and training on a part-time basis,there are already other mechanisms available for child care. For example,child care could be provided through Head Start and school-based programs,programs funded under the Social Services Block Grant, services providedthrough a specific education or training program such as the Job TrainingPartnership Act (JTPA) program, or the child care disregard under 45 CFR233.20(a)(11). At the same time, one of the AFDC program's major goalsis to foster independence from welfare. Consistent with that goal, we areproviding additional support to those recipients who are making a fullcommitment toward self-sufficiency in terms of training, high-school attendanceor GED equivalent on a full-time basis. That additional support is evidencedby including as an essential service the provision of child care.Finally, in view of the extreme difficulty of measuring whether a particularindividual provides emotional or psychological benefits, we believe thatincluding such ``intangible benefits'' in the list of benefits and serviceswould result in the same abuses of the essential person provision as arecurrently taking place.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked if the State would be free to definethe term ``full-time'' for purposes of the essential benefit or service.<T3>Response: </T3>The definition of full-time in essential benefits andservices as in ``attendance in high school (or GED) full-time'', ``workfull-time'', and ``training full-time'' is left to the States. However,the definition, applicable to both minor and adult caretaker relatives,must be consistent with the definition of full-time as used by the Statefor purposes of the earned income disregards at 45 CFR 233.20(a)(11) becauseStates have had to establish definitions of full-time work and school attendancefor comparable purposes. Accordingly, any work, high school (or GED) attendance,or training that does not meet the State's definition of full-time, wouldnot meet the requirement to permit the inclusion of an essential person.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked if the AFDC grant included paymentfor an essential person who provides child care which enables the caretakerrelative to work full-time, could child care expenses also be deductedfrom the caretaker relative's earnings?<T3>Response: </T3>If the AFDC grant includes payment for an essentialperson as described above, then the State may not deduct a child care allowancefrom the caretaker relative's earnings. The basis for including the essentialperson in the grant is the provision of services_i.e., child care. To thenpermit a deduction based on the caretaker paying for the same service wouldclearly be duplicative.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters asked if the essential person must berelated to the AFDC child.<T3>Response: </T3>There is no requirement that the essential person berelated to the AFDC child. However, States may choose to limit essentialpersons to certain categories of relatives, such as grandparents or stepparents.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter cited SSA-AT-80-32 (OFA), which transmittedthe AFDC final rule on continued absence, and asked about the impact theEssential Persons regulation would have on the convicted offender provision.The preamble to that final rule (45 FR 58125) states that ``the parentliving at home but serving a court imposed sentence may be considered anessential person * * *''  <T3>Response:</T3> The parent who is living at home but serving a court-imposedsentence may be considered an essential person if the State agency determinesthat he/she provides one of the five essential benefits or services describedunder the heading ``Discussion of Regulation'' above.  <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that the definition of incapacityincluded in the regulation was too strict, and suggested that we allowverification from third parties or a simple note from a physician regardingthe incapacitated person's condition and the expected duration of the condition. <T3>Response:</T3> The definition of incapacity in the essential personprovision is consistent with the definition of incapacity used for determiningdeprivation at 45 CFR 233.90(c)(1)(iv). We are adopting the evidentiaryrequirements for a finding of deprivation due to incapacity as well. Thisshould ease the administrative burden and reduce the chance of error. Therefore,if an individual cannot establish incapacity based upon eligibility forOASDI or SSI benefits due to disability or blindness, then the medicalevidence must meet State policy requirements for establishing incapacitywhich are consistent with provisions at 45 CFR 233.90(c)(1)(iv).    <T3>Comment:</T3> Two States raised an issue regarding Federal FinancialParticipation (FFP) in the following situation. An alcoholic parent liveswith but does not care for his/her children and the caretaker relativewho is not the other parent. Currently, both States provide for such aparent as an essential person. Since the parent does not provide servicesyet must be included in the unit, they asked how to include the parentand receive FFP as well.  <T3>Response:</T3> The current regulation at 45 CFR 206.10(a)(1)(vii) requiresthat all parents of AFDC dependent children must be included in the assistanceunit. The situtation in the comment above occurs when someone other thana parent is considered the caretaker relative even though a parent residesin the household. In this situation, if the State has determined that theparent is prevented from functioning as the caretaker relative becauseof a physical or mental condition, both the parent and caretaker may beincluded in the AFDC grant without applying the essential person provision. <T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters requested that we retain the current regulatorylanguage at 45 CFR 233.20(a)(2)(vi). These commenters state that, pursuantto the current regulation, when both parents live in the home but are notmarried to each other and have a child in common living with them, thesecond parent could be included as an essential person.  <T3>Response:</T3> Both parents could be included in the following case:The household consists of two unmarried parents with one common child andthree other children from the mother's previous marriage. The mother andher three children from the previous marriage are receiving AFDC benefits;the man and their commoon child are ineligible for AFDC because there isan intact family and the father is not disabled or unemployed. However,if the father is providing one of the five essential benefits or services,he could be included as an essential person.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 This final regulation has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 anddoes not meet any of the criteria for a major regulation. A regulatoryimpact analysis is not required because the regulation will not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; The Federal annual savings of these regulatory provisions are estimatedto be: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,5,r25 </C>  <H1>Year </H1><H1>Savings in millions</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">1988 <D>$13 (last quarter only). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1989 <D> 54. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1990 <D> 55. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1991 <D> 57. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1992 <D> 59.</D></ITAG></ITAG> (2) Impose a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) Result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,innovation, or the ability of United States based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Paperwork Reduction Act There will be no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements imposed onthe public or the States which would require clearance by the Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB). Regulatory Flexibility Act We certify that this regulation, if promulgated, will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities because it primarily affectsState governments and individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibilityanalysis as provided in Pub. L. 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act,is not required. Family and Federalism We certify that this action has been assessed using the criteria and principlesset forth in Executive Orders 12606 and 12612. While this regulation does not have any significant Federalism effects,it may have a significant monetary effect on certain families currentlyreceiving AFDC benefits supplemented by the inclusion of an essential personin the grant. We estimate that 86,000 families will be affected by thisregulation. The AFDC grants to these families will be reduced or, in somecases, terminated. The focus of this regulation is upon the exclusion of individuals who arenot providing an essential benefit or service, as essential persons. Forexample, some States have shifted 19 and 20 year-olds, who were made ineligibleby the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, onto the AFDC rolls asessential persons without any determination as to whether they are providingan essential benefit or service. This regulation in no way precludes individuals, who are providing oneof the designated benefits or services, from being included as essentialpersons. As a consequence, we believe that this regulation will not havea negative impact on family stability. Moreover, because this regulationfollows Congressional intent in limiting eligibility under the AFDC programto individuals under 19, we believe that any negative impact on familieswith 19 and 20 year-olds is justified. Finally, although AFDC will no longercover the needs of individuals who are not performing an essential benefitor service, many of these individuals will be eligible for assistance fromState-only programs. In summary, then, we believe that the language in the Final Rule strikesan appropriate balance which will prevent abuse, yet allow States the flexibilityto include those individuals who actually strengthen the family by assistingfamily members in becoming self-sufficient. <ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs 13.780, AssistancePayments Maintenance Assistance) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 233</ITAG>Aliens, Grant programs-social programs, Public assistance programs, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 2, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Wayne A.
