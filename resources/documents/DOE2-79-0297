An electrically heated furnace has been developed which consumes40% less energy than an oil fired furnace. Practically no discharge tothe exterior environment occurs and the furnace is silent compared with80-85dBA for an oil fired furnace. It is bell shaped and built of highquality insulation material and encased by refractory material. The bellis liftable at change of crucible and the crucible is easily handledwith a lifting device. The heating time for the furnace is less than24 hours. (L.F.).</TEXT></DOC>
