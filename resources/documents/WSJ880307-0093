Birnbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Presidential candidate Pat Robertson is expected today to accept a federal judge's ruling allowing him to drop his libel suit against former Rep. Pete McCloskey if he pays court costs incurred during the year and a half of preparation for trial.    Mr. Robertson said yesterday on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that he hadn't decided whether to agree to the judge's condition. But Julius Kaplan, his attorney, said the candidate would go along. &quot;Mr. Robertson will accept it,&quot; said Mr. Kaplan, referring to the decision by Judge Joyce Hens Green. &quot;We consider the decision of the judge to be a 100% victory.&quot;    In his $35 million suit, Mr. Robertson alleged that Mr. McCloskey, a California Republican, libeled him by asserting that Mr. Robertson used the influence of his father, a former U.S. senator, to avoid combat during the Korean War. Both men were second lieutenants who traveled to Korea on the same ship 37 years ago.    Mr. Robertson, a conservative Republican and former Christian broadcaster, decided to drop the case rather than face a three-week trial that was scheduled to begin tomorrow, the day on which 20 states hold presidential contests. Mr. McCloskey fought the attempt to drop the case, asserting that his side of the story was true and that more than a dozen former Marines were willing to testify on his behalf.    Mr. McCloskey, a liberal Republican who ran for president against President Nixon in 1972, asked that Mr. Robertson pay his $400,000 legal bill, which he says threatens to bankrupt him. But the judge rejected the request, arguing that Mr. Robertson would be prohibited from suing again over the statement and saying precedent doesn't justify imposing so hefty a condition.    George Lehner, an attorney for Mr. McCloskey, said the court costs involved in the judge's decision amount to about $10,000. But he noted that the issue isn't likely to disappear. Speaking of Mr. McCloskey, the attorney said, &quot;He doesn't intend to be shut up by this.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
