 Air Force Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base andBrooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston use Mass-11 on DigitalEquipment Corp.andP;  VAX computers under VMS.andM;Both located in San Antonio, Texas, the two medical centers are part of alarger San Antonio military medical complex that exchanges medical datathrough fiber-optic networking.andM;At Wilford Hall, the administrative staff uses Mass-11 on DEC VT terminalshooked up to two VAX 11-780s through Ethernet.andP;  The staff uses Mass-11 forroutine letters and memos in addition to list processing, said Staff Sgt.andO;Scott Ogawa, VAX system manager at Wilford Hall.andM;Wilford Hall houses the two VAXes under VMS system manager at Wilford Hall.andM;Wilford Hall houses the two VAXes under VMS and a variety of PCs underMS-DOS.andP;  The VAXes will be upgraded to either the 6000 or 9000 series soon,Ogawa said.andM;At Brooke Army Medical Center, all employees use Mass-11 for tasks rangingfrom general correspondence to transcribing medical text and pathologyreports, said Jeanie Etter, system manager for Brooke's VAX cluster.andM;Brooke has two VAX 11-750s, an 8250 and a 6220 as well as 25 Micro VAXes.andO;Users access Mass-11 through DEC VT 220 or 320 terminals and a variety of PCshooked up to the cluster through a fiber-optic local area network.andM;Mass-11, from Microsystems Engineering Corp. of Hoffman Estates, Ill., is aword processing program that includes Post-Script printing, statisticalediting and group authoring tools.andM;Originally developed for DEC PDP-11 minicomputers, the software now runs onthe VAX or Unix workstations.andM;Mass-11 is a shared logic system, allowing users to work in the same VMSaccount so multiple users can access data.andM;The system keeps journal files on each document that can be recovered in theevent of a power failure, said Microsystems Engineering spokeswoman CarolKarels.andM;Karels said the system can track usage statistics such as time, keystrokes,client job, operator and others for billing purposes, and has features forautomatic document assembly for technical documentation, proposals, reportsand forms.andM;Mass-11 also allows for cross-referencing and style selection.andP;  Users cancreate a shell document including pointrs to boilerplate text, graphics andvariable data residing anywhere on the system.andM;Add-ons to the word processing package include Mass-11 Manager, a relationaldatabase management system; Mass-11 Draw, a mouse-driven freehand graphicseditor that can produce presentation graphics, engineering drawings andchemical structures; and Mass-11 Mail and Mass-11 Menus, which allow VAXusers to integrate Mass-11 with third-party software.andM;Out of NecessityandM;Ogawa said Wilford Hall began using Mass-11 because at the time, in the early1980s, it was the only word processor that would run on the base's two VAXminicomputers.andM;Since that time, Wilford Hall has branched out to PCs and runs Mass-11 onthose as well.andM;Both military installations said Mass-11's 11't useful feature is itsextensive dictionary, particularly its specialized medical dictionary, arelatively new addition to the software.andM;&quot;The medical dictionary is one of the things that allows us to utilize thepackage so well,&quot; said J.R.andP;  Tuttle, a computer analyst who manages Brooke's25 Micro-VAXes.andM;Users also can customize the medical dictionary for their own use.andP;  &quot;For anoffice that deals with one small subset of medical terminology, such aspediatrics, it really helps,&quot; Tuttle said.andM;&quot;They can incorporate that into their own particular environment withoutloading it into the main dictionary, which would slow the spell checkingprocess down a little bit for everybody.&quot;andM;Communicating FreelyandM;Because both medical facilities are part of the Joint Military MedicalCommand and frequently communicate with each other, the fact that both useMass-11 is critical, tuttle said.andM;Data sent between installations includes transcription records, patient filesand histories and lab reports.andM;To send Mass-11 files to the other installation electronically through thenetwork using Mass-11 Mail, both Brooke and Wilford Hall must use Mass-11,Tuttle said.andM;Tuttle said one nice feature of the software is the ability to print acrossthe network.andM;&quot;I've got users in one office who want to send something printed to somebodyelse, but they don't want to go through the hassle of mailing the document.andO;With Mass-11, a user at Brooke could send something to print at someoneelse's queue anywhere on the network, including Wilford Hall,&quot; Tuttle said.andM;But the graphics capabilities of Mass-11 could be improved, Tuttle said.andM;He said WordPerfect, which he has worked with extensively, has betterfacilities for integrating pictures and graphs into the text.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
