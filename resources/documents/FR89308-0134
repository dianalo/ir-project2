The existing Convention deals with a wide rangeof issues such as native land rights, consultation between governmentsand native peoples in social and economic development, and issues of employment,vocational training, health and education affecting tribal peoples. TheConvention is being revised because its assimilationist or integrationistapproach to fundamental issues is widely seen as inapproprate and outdated.The ILO issued the report of the June 1988 session of the Conference Committeeon Convention No. 107 and a proposed Convention text based on the resultsof that meeting. The ILO requested that Member States submit amendmentsor comments on the proposed text. The U.S. Government prepared and submittedcomments to the ILO after consulting with U.S. employers' and workers'organizations, as well as U.S. indigenous groups (see DOL request for commentsfrom tribal governments in the October 28, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4>). The attached new ILO draft of the proposedrevised convention, which will be considered at the June 1989 session ofthe Conference, incorporates the comments of Member States. The Bureauof International Labor Affairs of the Department of Labor, with the assistanceof the Departments of Interior and State, will prepare the U.S. positionpaper on this draft text for the upcoming Conference. The Department ofLabor invites comments from tribal governments on the proposed revisedConvention. The revised Convention is intended to be a broad statementof principles that can be adopted by many countries whose indigenous andtribal peoples face a wide range of circumstances.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed on the 2d day of March, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Eugene K.
