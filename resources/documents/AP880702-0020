The White House released a 29-page report late Friday in whichan emergency board said both sides should make sacrifices.   The report also recommended arbitration if the nation'seighth-largest railroad and the United Transportation Union cannotagree on specific personnel cuts.   At issue is a CNW proposal to eliminate the jobs of 1,050 UTUbrakemen by cutting the size of its train crews from four to twoworkers _ an engineer and conductor _ in most cases.   Spokeswoman Leslie Cleveland said Chicago andamp; Northwestern couldsave about $51 million a year by reducing manpower, calling it anecessary step to remain competitive.   However, the union characterized the cuts affecting half its CNWmembers as a contract violation and demanded no change from thestatus quo.   It threatened to strike on April 22, prompting President Reaganto appoint the emergency board under the Railway Labor Act.   ``The carrier, unlike many of the other railroads in theindustry, has an economic need for relief from its presentcrew-consist rules. ...,'' the board said. ``This is not to saythat the employees, alone, should be expected to bear the burden.''   Although the board said CNW should be allowed to eliminate onebrakemen per train, it recommended that further reductions bedecided by an arbitration board case-by-case.   The panel also said CNW should be able to terminate some workersif not enough accept voluntary separation allowances. But it alsorecommended raising the railroad's proposed $25,000 allowance to$50,000 for employees leaving voluntarily and $45,000 for thoseforced into separation.   Company officials said they had not seen the report and had noimmediate comment Friday.   Donald F. Markgraf, the union's general chairman, said: ``Thesethings work out in strange ways sometimes. We're still hoping for asettlement.''   A strike cannot begin before 12:01 a.m. Aug. 4, said RolandWatkins, an administrative assistant to the emergency board.   Chicago andamp; Northwestern ranks eighth among U.S. railroads inrevenue and handled nearly 1.5 million carloads of traffic in 1986.It also provides the principal daily rail service for about 40,000commuters in the Chicago area.</TEXT></DOC>
