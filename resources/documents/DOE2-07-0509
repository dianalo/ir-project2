As such, the plastic opticalfiber is applied in short-distance light transmission because of theease in connection to the light source etc., the convenience in its handlingdue to the visible light and the low cost. The effects of various treatmentsin radiation resistance of the PMMA optical fiber have been examined.The {gamma}-ray induced loss can be suppressed by hot water treatment.But at the same time the intrinsic loss in the unirradiated state isincreased. Therefore, it is desirable to diffuse the water content, whichleads to suppression of the {gamma}-ray induced loss, in the fiber atlow temperature. (Mori, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
