Under the conversion, holders of the home building company's 11.6 million shares outstanding received one unit in the new partnership for each share held, Standard-Pacific said. The company's holders approved the plan earlier this month.    As previously reported, Standard-Pacific said the conversion was made primarily to take advantage of tax laws that don't require limited partnerships to pay state or federal taxes. </TEXT></DOC>
