The decision came one day after a U.S. district court, citing antitrust law, prohibited Minorco from proceeding with its tender offer for Consolidated. The British and American actions are considered blows, though not fatal ones, to Minorco's plan, and led some analysts to speculate that the setback could provide time for other bidders to step forward.    An attorney for Minorco said yesterday that the company would file today an appeal of the U.S. ruling. Also yesterday, Judge Michael B. Mukasey, the U.S. district judge who issued the preliminary injunction against Minorco's bid, said a bond wouldn't have to be posted for possible damages suffered by Consolidated, pending the outcome of the British government's investigation.    Britain's Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young referred the hotly contested bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, citing worries about &quot;competition in the markets for certain high-value minerals and metals, and especially titanium and zircon.&quot; His remarks highlight the central role of Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd., an Australian mining company in which Consolidated owns a 48.4% stake. Renison claims to be the world's largest producer of mineral sands, feedstocks for titanium and zircon, two widely used metals.    The British investigation underscores the Tory government's mixed record on foreign takeovers and reflects growing international opposition to South African-controlled companies because of that country's apartheid policies.    Minorco, based in Luxembourg but with ties to a huge South African industrial empire, has bid for the 70.6% of the British mining giant that it doesn't already own. Since launching the offer on Sept. 21, Minorco has increased its holding to 29.6% from 29.4%. Consolidated has mounted a costly lobbying campaign to defeat the bid, asking Britain, the U.S., South Africa, the European Community Commission and Australia to stop the offer for anti-competitive or national interest reasons.    Rudolph Agnew, Consolidated's chairman, said he was &quot;delighted by the decision&quot; to investigate the bid in Britain. But news of the government's investigation depressed Consolidated's share price yesterday. Initially the shares plummeted 118 pence ($2.07) on London's stock exchange, but they recovered somewhat to trade at 1139 pence each, off 106 pence.    The government probe, expected to last three months, could keep Consolidated's share price in the doldrums, which may invite rival bidders, some analysts believe.    A Minorco spokesman declined to comment, other than to say its offer automatically lapsed yesterday because of the investigation. Minorco offered #9.5 in cash plus new Minorco shares for each Consolidated share, giving its offer an indicated value of #13 a share. The offer valued the entire company at about #2.9 billion.    Minorco is 60.1% owned by Anglo-American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold- and diamond-mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimers, one of South Africa's wealthiest families. Minorco already had agreed to sell most of the Consolidated interests that significantly would increase its holdings of precious metals. It also had said any merged company would dispose of Consolidated's 49.7% stake in Newmont Corp., the biggest U.S. gold mining company, and its 38% stake in Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd., a gold and platinum mining company.    But that leaves unaddressed the issue of strategic minerals, especially titanium and zircon, that are principally represented by the Renison stake. Minorco may be able to satisfy Britain by promising to sell Consolidated's stake in Renison but so far hasn't responded to questions about its Renison plans.    The British government's decision to investigate Minorco's offer comes amid increased criticism of its inconsistent regulation of foreign takeovers. The government can block bids if it decides they threaten competition or national interest. In late May, the government turned a deaf ear to the public protest over Nestle S.A.'s #2.1 billion hostile bid for Rowntree PLC. But earlier this month, it ordered Kuwait to cut its stake in British Petroleum Co. by more than half to 9.9%. That decision was attacked as a violation of the goverment's commitment to a free market.    The government's foreign takeover policy &quot;does seem to be slightly arbitrary,&quot; said Graham Birch, an analyst with London brokerage Kleinwort Grieveson Securities Ltd. Another analyst said that with its monopolies probe of the Minorco bid, the government's &quot;message seems to be that South Africa no longer is welcome&quot; as a foreign bidder in Britain.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher long has opposed economic sanctions to force South Africa to dismantle its apartheid system of racial segregation. But she has come under international pressure to act against Minorco because of its South African ties.    ---   Betty Wong in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
