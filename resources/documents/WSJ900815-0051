Inc. and a California community in a disputethat is holding up production of as much as 100,000 barrels aday of offshore oil.   Department officials see resolution of the dispute overthe completed Point Arguello offshore oil project, near SantaBarbara, Calif., as one of the fastest ways to help boostU.S. oil production in the wake of possibly a fourmillion-barrel-a-day shortfall in world supplies because ofIraq's invasion of Kuwait.</LP><TEXT>   The $2.5 billion project, built by a consortium of oilcompanies led by the Chevron Corp. unit, consists of threeoffshore drilling platforms that mechanically have been readyto begin production for 2 1/2 years. But no oil has beenproduced because of deep disagreements between the oilcompanies and local communities over how to move the oil 130miles downshore to refineries in Los Angeles.   Los Angeles and other communities blocked construction ofa new pipeline, and California coastal officials rejected aplan to move the oil by tanker.   According to a department official, Energy Secretary JamesWatkins agreed to explore ways to try to settle the disputeafter the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors votedyesterday to send a letter inviting federal involvement. Thecounty board is responsible for granting the permits thatcould get the project running.   Chevron indicated it would speak with federal officials,but it seemed determined to stick to its original plan ofseeking a new permit from the board in November to transportthe oil by tanker on an interim basis until it can build anew pipeline or work out a way to use existing pipelines.   &quot;I don't think they {federal officials} have either thecapability or the legal ability to resolve an issue that hasdragged on as long as it has in Santa Barbara County,&quot; said aChevron spokesman. The Department of Energy &quot;is free to dowhat it can to provide advice and counsel, and we'd be happyto hear what proposals they have. But Chevron and itspartners are not running to the DOE, and we don't want to beperceived as somehow using this national crisis,&quot; he said.   Without a declaration in Washington of a national energyemergency, which isn't planned, it's unclear what powers ofmediation are open to the Energy Department. The departmenthas begun looking for options to break the logjam, includingthe possibility of using the Coast Guard to help prevent atanker spill. Another option might be to make light crudeavailable from a U.S. naval petroleum reserve to mix withheavy Point Arguello crude, which otherwise is too thick tomove down an existing pipeline to Los Angeles. But officialscautioned they have just begun to explore the feasibility ofthose options and to look for others.   Besides the three oil-drilling platforms, one of which isoperated by Texaco Inc. and two by Chevron, the projectincludes a new onshore oil-treating plant. The pipelines arealready in place from the platforms to the treatment plant.The dispute is over how to ship the oil from the treatmentplant, where water and natural gas are split from the oil, toa refinery. Chevron estimates the field contains at least 200million to 300 million barrels of oil.   The Chevron spokesman said the project could beginproduction at about 20,000 barrels a day, building up toabout 75,000 barrels within a year and full production of100,000 barrels a day within three years. But EnergyDepartment officials who have spoken to some of Chevron's 17oil partners said they've heard estimates that the projectcould produce as much as 40,000 to 80,000 barrels a day in asearly as three to six months, with full production of 100,000barrels a day eventually.</TEXT></DOC>
