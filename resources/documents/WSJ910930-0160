While companies theoretically will lose billions ofdollars in future business and thousands of workers couldlose their jobs, most of the programs the administration hastargeted for cancellation already were in trouble technicallyor politically.</LP><TEXT>   Cutting them outright means that companies will be sparedthe cash squeeze that inevitably occurs when a manufacturingline sputters along without ever reaching full productionrates. This way, too, the government apparently will covertermination costs -- a sum estimated to reach as much as $500million during the next two years.   Boeing Co.'s SRAM II short-range attack missile, forexample, has been plagued by test failures and is far behindschedule. Overruns have cost the Seattle company &quot;hundreds ofmillions of dollars&quot; in losses, according to the Air Force.Now, &quot;we won't have to keep sinking money into it,&quot; says oneBoeing official.   Another program the president has pegged for cancellation,the MX rail garrison, had a dubious future as well. Earlierthis month, the Senate voted to save $600 million byscrapping plans to test the train system, which was attackedas a Cold War &quot;anachronism.&quot;   The project &quot;has looked like it wouldn't go forward forsome time,&quot; says Donald Beall, the chairman of RockwellInternational Corp., which was working on it along withBoeing, TRW Inc. and Westinghouse Electric Corp. Now, hesays, his company should be able &quot;to reallocate ourresources&quot; to more productive areas.   Overall, the president's proposal will push themilitary-industrial complex into becoming smaller and moreefficient -- a restructuring long under way at somecompanies. &quot;A lot of us have already started on the path ofdownsizing,&quot; says James Mellor, General Dynamics Corp.'spresident. &quot;It's just the new reality.&quot;   The administration's blueprint also underscores the trendaway from nuclear weapons and toward conventional arms, suchas those used in the Persian Gulf War. &quot;The Third World --that's where the challenge is going to be,&quot; says BernardSchwartz, chairman of Loral Corp., a leadingdefense-electronics concern.   Accordingly, the president's decision to scrap the nuclearversion of the Tomahawk cruise missile could be a break forits manufacturers, General Dynamics and McDonnell DouglasCorp. Brad Beaver, director of the Tomahawk program atGeneral Dynamics, says that although only a fraction of themissile fleet was to have been equipped with nuclearwarheads, complications with verification treaties could haveaffected even the conventional variety of the weapon. Now, heexplains, &quot;the program won't get wrapped up in all thosearms-control issues.&quot;   Meanwhile, Mr. Bush also reiterated support for NorthropCorp.'s B-2 bomber, and called for more command-and-controlsystems and anti-missile networks, which ultimately couldtranslate into more business for Rockwell, Lockheed Corp.,Raytheon Co. and others.   And the president pushed for continued development of thesingle-warhead Midgetman missile, which is being put togetherby a team of contractors including Rockwell, TRW, GenCorp'sAerojet unit, Martin Marietta Corp. and Hercules Inc. (In ablow to Boeing, the only portion of Midgetman slated forcancellation was a hardened mobile basing system, which thecompany had valued at $1 billion.)   William Perry, co-director of the Center for InternationalSecurity and Arms Control at Stanford University, says thatby &quot;taking the initiative&quot; on arms reduction, President Bushmay &quot;be in a stronger position to preserve some of theprograms he wants.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
