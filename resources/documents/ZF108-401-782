 Thisreview examines the tools Novell offers for developing applications underNetWare.andM;PC Week put Novell's tools through their paces by using the demonstrationprograms supplied with each tool as well as programs downloaded from Novell'sCompuServe forum.andM;Novell bundles its tools and documentation so that developers buy only whatthey need.andP;  This arrangement can be confusing, but it provides flexibility.andM;While all of these products are functional, PC Week found that Novell has notprovided clear documentation for most of them.andM;In cases where Novell has taken third-party development products and adaptedthem for NetWare, seams between the original products and Novell's additionsshow in many places.andM;Nevertheless, these tools work.andP;  Developers already familiar with NetWareAPIs will probably be able to look past the rough edges and get their workdone.andM;First-time users, however, will need determination to brave the world ofNetWare development.andM;----------NetWare System Calls for DOS, NetWare C Interface for DOS, NetWare OS/2SoftwareandM;Development KitandM;Novell's most basic tool for developers is NetWare System Calls for DOS, aset of manuals that describes the assembly-language calling conventions foraccessing NetWare functions from DOS workstations.andP;  This product isdocumentation only; it includes no software.andM;System Calls for DOS is meant for programmers who write assembly code.andO;However, programmers who work with higher-level languages, such as TurboPascal, could also use this manual to interface to NetWare, using libraryfunctions that can access PC software interrupts.andM;NetWare C Interface for DOS documents the NetWare system calls in a moreconvenient form for C programmers.andP;  It includes a set of C functions thataccess the NetWare system calls.andP;  The functions are provided in source codeform, so they can be modified and enhanced by the developer.andM;Both System Calls for DOS and C Interface for DOS include the NetWare SystemInterface Technical Overview manual.andP;  Newcomers to NetWare programming shouldread this manual to understand the general capabilities they can accessthrough the system calls.andM;Users of either of these two products will find that the documentationprovides enough help to get them started, but is far from thorough.andM;Information is missing on how the system calls vary between versions ofNetWare, and examples of how to use the system calls are often incorrect andincomplete.andM;Novell is now also shipping the NetWare OS/2 1.2 Software Development Kit.andO;However, PC Week was unable to obtain a copy from Novell.andM;According to Novell, the kit includes the C header files and dynamic linklibraries (DLLs) for calling NetWare.andP;  Like the C Interface for DOS, sourcecode is provided for the libraries.andM;----------C Network Compiler for DOS Clients, C NetworkandM;Compiler/386andM;Novell offers two C compiler development environments.andM;For developers who need to access only NetWare workstation API services,Novell provides the C Network Compiler for DOS Clients.andM;Although Novell sells the product bundled with its network APIs, the compileralso can be used for developing non-networked C applications.andM;The C Network Compiler/386 lets software developers create NetWare LoadableModules (NLMs), NetWare's version of server-based applications, that run in aNetWare 386 server.andP;  The compiler can also be used to create DOS-extenderclient programs.andM;To create these programs, however, the developer must also purchase a 386linker, such as Phar Lap Software Inc.'s 386Link.andP;  The C Network Compiler/386cannot be used to create programs for 286 or 8086 PCs.andM;Both compilers, which are fully standard with ANSI and optimize C, weredeveloped by Watcom Systems Inc. of Waterloo, Ontario.andM;They include the ANSI-standard C library, debugger, program-make facility,linker and other compiler-related tools.andP;  Novell also includesNetWare-specific API libraries for NetWare system calls, Btrieve and serverNLMs.andM;The cores of both compilers are well-documented and do their job well.andP;  Inareas such as compiling speed and generated code quality, Watcom comparesfavorably with other C compilers, including those offered by BorlandInternational Inc. and Microsoft.andM;The overall fit and finish of both compilers are hurt by poor documentationfor NetWare system calls and code libraries, and the package shows signs ofbeing hastily assembled.andM;For example, the setup program for compiler installation does not copy thenetwork-related disks provided with the package; they must be installedmanually.andM;C Network Compiler/386 is used to create NLMs.andP;  NLM programmers have accessto a familiar C programming environment, as many standard C functions areavailable, including console I/O with the C-language print function.andP;  NLMscan access files in the network file system using standard C file operations.andO;NetWare API calls for facilities such as IPX, Novell's standard communicationprotocol, are also provided.andM;The 386 compiler package does not contain a debugger for testing NLMs in theDOS environment.andP;  Instead, NLMs are debugged by running them on a NetWare 386server.andP;  To expedite this process, NetWare 386 includes a command-linedebugger similar to DOS' Debug.andP;  Since the server stops processing networkrequests while the debugger is active, NLM debugging should only be done on anon-essential server.andM;Documentation is again a problem with the C Network Compiler/386.andP;  A short80-page booklet called Client/Server Tutorial is devoted mostly to themechanics of building an NLM.andP;  Nothing in the booklet informs the programmerof his or her duties in a non-preemptive operating system such as NetWare386.andM;----------Netware Remote Procedure Call (RPC) ToolsandM;Developers who create client/server applications can choose one of severalmethods for sending messages between clients and servers (see story, Page73).andM;One higher-level alternative to IPX or other protocols is the NetWare RemoteProcedure Call (RPC) tool, which allows developers to define the interfacebetween client and server applications using a standard C calling convention,rather than directly using underlying communication protocols.andM;Netwise Inc., of Boulder, Colo., makes Novell's RPC tools.andM;The biggest advantages of RPC are its protocol independence and its abilityto translate data between different hardware architectures.andP;  These featuresare most critical for developers in multiple-vendor hardware environments.andO;Developers looking for top performance in a PC-only NetWare environment willprobably find that IPX's efficiency and simplicity make it a better choice.andM;Novell's documentation for the RPC tool is impressive.andP;  The manual clearlydescribes the options available, and plenty of example programs are availableon disk.andM;However, the C programming examples provided with the RPC undercut itscommunication-independent nature somewhat by placing communication errorchecks after each remote procedure call.andP;  To its credit, the manual describesa method for putting error checks into the client code stub (see story, Page73).andP;  That way, the client/server code division can be changed without anyreprogramming.andM;For developers who are more concerned about performance than interoperabilitywith other operating systems, Novell offers a less expensive, &quot;direct&quot;version of NetWare RPC for DOS that does not do data translation.andM;No source code changes are required if developers later need to upgrade tothe standard version.andM;----------Btrieve Record ManagerandM;Both NetWare 286 and NetWare 386 include the Btrieve record manager.andP;  Btrieveprovides the ability to maintain multiple index fields per file, and includesintegrity controls such as deadlock detection and transaction processing.andO;Application programmers can use NetWare's Btrieve functions to manage theirown programmed databases.andM;Developers who wish to use the Btrieve APIs in non-Novell environments canpurchase versions for stand-alone DOS, OS/2 and Xenix.andM;Documentation provided for the Btrieve package includes respectabledescriptions of the different options and configurations.andP;  An appendix in themanual provides clear examples.andM;Btrieve is a server-based application.andP;  It runs as a value-added process onNetWare 286 servers and as an NLM on NetWare 386 servers.andP;  The serveradministrator must configure and start the Btrieve process before anyBtrieve-based client applications can run.andM;In DOS, the client side first loads a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)program that provides the Btrieve API.andP;  (In OS/2 and Microsoft Windows, theAPI interface is implemented as a DLL.) The Btrieve application makes callsto the library, which relays them to the Btrieve server process.andM;----------Support Is ImportantandM;Developers surveyed by PC Week rated support as their greatest concern.andO;Novell offers support through its Development Products Division in Austin,Texas.andP;  Three different telephone technical support options are available,the most expensive being a $500-per-year unlimited plan.andP;  More budget-mindeddevelopers can opt for a $50-per-incident support fee; or a 10-incident,$200-per-year fee.andP;  Users are not charged for support if the bug they reportis a product problem that has not been documented.andM;Users who register their products with Novell receive free telephone supportfor 30 days.andM;In addition, registered users receive a monthly newsletter that listsupdates, reported bugs and bug fixes.andM;Another valuable source of technical support is the Novell NetWire forum onthe on-line CompuServe Information Service.andP;  Independent developers andNovell staff frequent the Novell Forum A (NOVA) forum and usually offer helpwithin a day.andP;  There is no charge for this support other than standardCompuServe connect fees.andM;Good support is essential for these products because many of them have poordocumentation.andP;  Some of the products have not been updated to reflect changesintroduced by NetWare 386.andP;  Novell officials indicate that improved manualsare in the works.andM;NetWare developers will need a sturdy shelf to handle the reams of Novelldocumentation, and patience to read some of it.andP;  Often, developers will haveto write test programs to clarify the behavior of poorly documented systemcalls.andM;Third-party sources of documentation and information are also available.andP;  TheNetWare Technical Journal is published quarterly, and provides in-depthinformation about developing NetWare applications.andP;  The publication is $34.95for a one-year subscription, and can be ordered by calling (800) 433-0880.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
