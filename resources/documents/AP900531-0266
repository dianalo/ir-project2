The Securities and Exchange Commission voted unanimously to seekpublic comment on the appropriateness of permitting selected foreigntender offers to proceed in this country under foreign rules andregulations.   Such an exception to SEC rules is still a long way off but thecommission took the first step toward even considering it.   Currently, those buying and selling publicly-offered securitiesin this country must comply with SEC regulations _ which someforeign concerns find too expensive or too onerous.   Consequently, rather than cut in U.S. holders of foreign stockson tender offers for their securities, overseas concerns have chosento exclude them.   The SEC will issue what they call a ``concept release,'' seekingpublic opinion on the idea of allowing foreign rules to apply wherethe U.S. securities holdings involved constitute a relatively smallportion of the securities in the transaction.   Among the things that have yet to be decided: the definition of a``relatively small portion.''</TEXT></DOC>
