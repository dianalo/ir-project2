BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Equimark Corp. Tuesday became the thirdinstitution in recent weeks to delay previously announced buyoutsof insolvent Texas banks.   Officials said they expect the deals still will go through, butit's taking longer to put new values on the billions in dollars ofloans and other assets that have to be reviewed.   Pittsburgh-based Equimark said it would be sometime in the nextthree months before it completes its purchase of San Antonio-basedNational Bancshares Corp. of Texas. Originally, the deal had beenexpected to close by the end of the year.   Last month, Deposit Guaranty Bank and Bank One Corp. bothannounced delays in their takeovers of Texas American Banks and thefailed MCorp banks, respectively.   In all three cases, the institutions said they hadunderestimated the time needed to re-evaluate the insolvent banks'holdings. The institutions say they are finding no additionalproblems, and there is little chance the deals will have to berenegotiated.   David Barr, spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. inWashington, said, ``I don't think the problems are significantenough that the deals will have to be restructured.   ``Unexpected delays happen to arise,'' he said. ``We stillexpect these deals to close. I'm not quite sure whether the FDICever put a time frame on when we would like them to close.''   Equimark announced July 21 it would buy National Bancshares,putting up $31 million of its own money. The Federal DepositInsurance Corp. pledged $250 million in assistance, another $86million was to be raised privately and National Bancsharesshareholders will retain a 2 percent stake.   The largest of the deals was Bank One Corp.'s June 28 agreementto purchase the 20 failed former MCorp banks. The Ohio company saidit would ante up $500 million. FDIC Chairman William Seidmanestimated it would cost the government as much as $2 billion _ thesecond costliest bank bailout in history.   Bank One immediately took over management of the banks, namingthem Bank One Texas, and said it expected to close the purchasewithin four to six months. On Nov. 9 the company said delays hadpushed the close until Jan. 17.   Deposit Guaranty won its bid for Texas American Banks on July20. The Dallas-based bank has raised $200 million to buy the banks_ since renamed Team Bank _ and the government estimates it willhave to spend $900 million.   Last week Deposit Guaranty said its closing also was delayed,but would be completed at an unspecified date.   Tuesday, Equimark Chairman Alan S. Fellheimer said, ``Theprocess of marking to current value all of the assets andliabilities of NBC is very time consuming.''   Michael E. Jehle, Equimark's chief financial officer, saidEquimark had found no additional problems in its review of thebank, but the takeover had been complicated by the otherFDIC-assisted deals.   ``All of them have a mark-to-market of billions and billions ofdollars (of assets) on very large banks all at the same time,'' hesaid. ``It takes longer trying to do three at once.''   Both Bank One and Deposit Guaranty cited similar problems.   ``The problems are about the same level we expected,'' DepositGuaranty Chairman Ron Steinhart said Tuesday. ``It just takeslonger to get all the stuff down. ... when you were making loans in36 different locations, with files in 36 different locations.''</TEXT></DOC>
