The present reactorstrategy to develop FBR will be maintained. LWRs with a total capacityof 25,680 MW have been performing quite well. While such projects ofnuclear fuel cycle as uranium enrichment and reprocessing, as well asthe disposal of radioactive waste, are lagging behind the progress ofpower reactors and are still in developmental stage. An emphasis is placedto promote these back end projects in order to establish a balanced systemof nuclear energy uses.</TEXT></DOC>
