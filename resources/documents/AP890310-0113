(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As many as 115 coastal homes andstructures along the Outer Banks island chain have been destroyed ordamaged by three days of high waves spawned by a storm driftingslowly out to sea.   ``I got to laugh to keep from crying,'' said Kitty Hawk residentJoseph Verscharen as he and his wife, Janet, surveyed the damage totheir oceanfront lot Thursday. ``This was our castle.''   About 10 feet of their cottage hung over a 6-foot cliff where theocean had eroded more than 75 feet of beach and a protective dunethe Verscharens built after storm damage last April.   Thursday night, officials opened a shelter at Kitty HawkElementary School for oceanfront residents fearing the abnormallyhigh tides and 15-foot waves.   Meanwhile, five traffic fatalities and two deaths fromhypothermia were linked to slick roads and cold weather over thepast three days.   In addition to buildings damaged or destroyed, scores more arethreatened from Sandbridge in Virginia Beach south through the OuterBanks chain of barrier islands off the North Carolina coast.   On Hatteras Island, three neighboring motels in Buxton wereendangered when the morning's high tide breached a protective dune.Residents fighting 45 mph wind and a sleet storm pitched in to fillsandbags by hand, while bulldozers pushed up sand to rebuild thedune line.   ``Whatever we do have left, it will be because the people ofHatteras came to help. It's something I'll never forget,'' saidCarol Dawson, co-owner of the 43-unit Cape Hatteras Motel. ``Theonly thing we can hope for now is the weather. We're at the mercy ofthe weather.''   Outside the old U.S. Coast Guard Station at Oregon Inlet wavesbattered the concrete pilings of the bridge over the inlet fromHatteras to Bodie Island. ``It is as bad as it can be short of ahurricane,'' said Lt. Martin L. Phillips, commander of the U.S.Coast Guard Cape Hatteras group.   He said erosion toppled a 125-foot U.S. Navy electronics tower onthe inlet Thursday morning.   The storm will probably alter Oregon Inlet, a passage to the seafor fishing boats, he said.   ``You can't depend on the aids to navigation out there now,''Phillips said. ``The storm is pushing a lot of sand around.''   At Kitty Hawk, a dozen people watched Thursday while a cottageshook against the waves until its support pilings broke, sliding thehome into the surf in one piece. As it went into the ocean, a newwater heater, kitchen appliances and new decking went with it. Thehouse made a quarter turn in the waves and bounced off five morehomes to its south before breaking up.   Armand and Betty Muller, owners of the ClayDon Motor Lodge inKill Devil Hills, lost one unit Wednesday and watched Thursday whenanother section of the motel they have managed for 23 years slippedinto the sea.   ``It didn't go all at once. It has been coming down for threehigh tides,'' Mrs. Muller said. ``But yesterday, when we saw thefloor fall out of the bottom unit and the furniture go floatingaway, we knew it was over.''</TEXT></DOC>
