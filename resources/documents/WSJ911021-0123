You realize, of course, that whatever you get now willlook like a stone ax in three to five years. Processor powerwill continue to double every two years or so. Memory usewill rise tenfold every five years. Software will become morepowerful and easier to use. Operating systems will change.Multimedia software . . ..</LP><TEXT>   Enough. You get the idea. But you figure you have to jumpin sometime, and you are convinced this is the time. Someadvice may help you find your way through the thicket.                                                                                                          IBM vs. Apple.                                                                                                          In general, the mainstream personal-computer world isdivided into IBM-compatibles and Apple Macintoshes, so thisrepresents your first decision.   To understand the implications, it helps to know what an&quot;operating system&quot; is. Because an application-softwarepackage (such as a spreadsheet or word-processing program)doesn't speak the same language as computer hardware, anoperating system has to translate. So, when people refer to acomputer as IBM-compatible, they are saying that it can runsome version of the operating system -- known as MS-DOS --that was originally designed for International BusinessMachines Corp. computers.   The big advantage of IBM-compatibles is their numbers:There are probably 60 million IBM-compatible personalcomputers in use, about 10 times the number of Macintoshes.Hundreds of manufacturers make IBM-compatibles; only AppleComputer Inc. makes Macs. Because of the enormous number ofIBM-compatible PCs, thousands of vendors will offer productsand support for them for years to come, even as new standardsevolve.   Apple Macs, on the other hand, are easy to use and easy toset up. Users rave about their &quot;graphical interface,&quot; whichthe IBM-compatible world is trying to match. The Macs'graphic presentation lets users navigate through or betweenapplications by choosing from among little pictures, or&quot;icons,&quot; on the screen, instead of having to type memorizedcommands. Once you learn to use one Mac program, the next onewill be a snap. Moreover, the new Macs have the ability toread files created on IBM-compatible PCs.                                                                                                          What's the PC for?                                                                                                          What you want to do with a PC to some extent determinesthe computer you buy. In general, IBM-compatibles dominateword processing and number crunching, while Macintoshes excelat graphics and desktop publishing. But there is a large andgrowing overlap between the two worlds. Increasingly, if youwant to do the most common things -- write letters, talk toelectronic services such as Prodigy, keep an inventory ofyour assets, play games, whatever -- almost any of thehundreds of IBM-compatible PCs or Macintosh computers willprobably do.   You also should consider what your future needs will be.As people master their PCs, and as more powerful softwarepackages come along, they find they want a more powerfulmachine than they initially thought they needed. You don'twant to spend a couple of thousand dollars for a PC that youwill quickly outgrow.   Finally, if everyone you know uses a given kind ofcomputer, it may be worthwhile to go with the crowd. Don'tunderestimate the value of being able to share problems andcompare notes with friends.                                                                                                          Think twice about laptops.                                                                                                          Laptops include so-called notebook computers that weighabout seven pounds or less and can run on batteries, andheavier, more powerful machines that can be transported(although not always comfortably), and need to be pluggedinto an electrical outlet.   Generally, if you are buying only one computer, avoidlaptops unless you must have a transportable computer. Adesktop PC offers more value for your money, more room forupgrades and good-quality color monitors. Laptops also becomeobsolete more quickly.                                                                                                          What you can expect to pay.                                                                                                          The field is hotly competitive, and now is a good time tobuy. Figure you will pay at least $1,000 for a basic,not-too-powerful PC. An adult-strength system, with all thesoftware you need included, will probably run about $1,500 to$2,500. And for $3,000 to $3,500, you can get a PC forhigher-tech tastes. Of course, you can always spend more forextra goodies that you may or may not need.   Try to be sure any price you are quoted includes all theelements you want. Some ads give a great price and say&quot;monitor optional.&quot; A PC without a monitor is like a carwithout wheels.                                                                                                          What's in a PC?                                                                                                          Unless you know something about the features of the PC youplan to buy, you will be lost. Don't worry: It mainly soundscomplicated. So hang on.   Start with the CPU, or central processing unit. Think ofthe CPU as the brains of the computer. It is a computer chipin the PC's base unit, and it is usually referred to by anumber. In ascending order of power (and cost), those numbersare:   The 8088, used in the original IBM PC introduced in 1981,as well as in the subsequent IBM XT. Buying one of thosetoday is like buying a rotary telephone in a touch-toneworld.   The 80286 was introduced in IBM's AT personal computer in1984. It is a 16-bit processor, the absolute minimum for youto consider. A bit, or binary digit, is the smallest unit ofdata that computers work with. Eight bits are in a byte,which is the amount of memory needed to store a single numberor letter. If you just want to write letters, play games, anddo simple spreadsheets, an 80286 will get you started.   The 32-bit 80386 or the slightly less powerful 386SXchips, vastly more powerful than the 30286 machines, willprobably give the home user the most value over time. If youwant to run multiple programs simultaneously, get the mostout of Microsoft Windows, or run heavy graphics or databaseapplications, you will want at least a 386SX.   The 486, the generation after the 386s, now is the mostpowerful IBM-compatible CPU, though it is overkill for homeuse.                                                                                                          Why you should have a hard disk.                                                                                                          A hard disk, usually permanently installed inside thecomputer, allows you to quickly store and retrieve data. Youcan get by without a hard disk for basic computing, just asyou can shovel snow with a tablespoon, but why would you wantto? Moreover, many large programs require a hard disk to runat all.   Disks are measured in terms of their storage capacity --specifically in megabytes. One megabyte equals about amillion characters. A common mistake is to buy a PC with toosmall a disk. Thirty megabytes are a minimal requirement, but60 megabytes or more are preferable. (To give you an idea ofthe amount of information we're talking about, the Englishtext of the Bible takes up about 4.5 megabytes of diskspace.)   Hard disks are also measured by the speed required to findinformation on the disk. A speed of 60 milliseconds is slow.An acceptable speed is about 28 milliseconds; less than 20milliseconds is considered very fast.                                                                                                          How about floppy disks?                                                                                                          Floppy disks allow users to store and move data from onecomputer to another. You need at least one floppy-disk drive,to load programs and data from a floppy disk to a computer'shard-disk drive, and vice versa. You also need it to makebackup copies of your data.   The two common sizes of floppy disks are 5.25-inch and3.5-inch, neither of which can be used in the other sizedrive. Each size is available in high-density and low-densitystandards; high-density disks can read disks of lowerdensity, but low-density disks can't read the high-densityvariety.   The trend is to 3.5-inch, high-density disks, but if youwork with people who use 5.25-inch drives, consider gettingone drive of each size. Laptops use 3.5-inch drives. Expectto pay up to $100 to have a second floppy drive installed.                                                                                                          What is all the talk about RAMs?                                                                                                          RAM -- or Random Access Memory -- is the computer's workarea, where programs and data are temporarily stored when inuse. If you don't have enough RAM memory, some programs won'trun at all. Others will run -- but slowly. That happensbecause without enough RAM to work with, your computer mayhave to repeatedly store and retrieve information on therelatively slow hard disk.   The amount of RAM you need depends on what you want to do.The minimum for low-end PCs used to be 640,000 bytes, or640K. But these days, one megabyte (one million bytes) isconsidered a minimum, even though not all software is able totake advantage of that much RAM.   Programs are getting bigger, requiring more RAM. If youwant to run Microsoft Windows 3.0, for instance, you can getby with two megabytes of RAM, but you might wish you had fourmegabytes.   RAM chips also vary in speed from the creaking 120nanoseconds (120 billionths of a second) of a few years agoto 60 nanoseconds or better today. The speed of the RAM chipsmust be compatible with the speed of your system.                                                                                                          Color monitors vs. monochrome.                                                                                                          Systems with color monitors generally cost a few hundreddollars more than those with monochrome monitors. But coloris more fun to look at, especially if you or your childrenever plan to play games on your PC. Color also can conveyinformation at a glance that your eyes would hunt for on amonochrome screen.   The quality of your monitor depends, among other things,on the number of &quot;pixels,&quot; or dots, that make up the image.The more pixels, the sharper the image. For instance, aso-called VGA monitor provides 640 pixels horizontally and480 vertically. VGA is now the most common standard formonitors, though 800x600 and 1,024x768 are available inhigher-end systems.                                                                                                          Putting it on paper.                                                                                                          You very likely will want to print information yourcomputer generates. At the low end, for about $300, you canget a reasonable 24-pin dot-matrix printer. (These printersuse various numbers of pins to strike a ribbon; the morepins, the higher the resolution. Twenty-four pins is at thehigh end; nine is at the low end.)   The next step up is an inkjet printer such asHewlett-Packard Co.'s Deskjet, which sells for about $500.High-quality laser printers are available for as little as$650, but most cost about $1,000. Be sure the toner cartridgeis included in the price, as the printer won't work withoutit. You will also need a printer cable ($5-$30) to connectthe printer to the PC.                                                                                                          Calling the outside world.                                                                                                          You will need a modem and communications software if youwant to dial such telephone services as bulletin boards,electronic-mail providers and information data bases, or ifyou want to talk to other computers. Modems, which typicallycome with adequate communications software, are ratedaccording to their speed in so-called baud, or the number ofbits per second they can transmit. A capacity of 2,400 baudis reasonable for most home computing these days. Some PCscome with modems, some of which can be used to send faxes.You can use the phone line you already have for your PC.                                                                                                          If you're into games . . .                                                                                                          A joystick and a game port to plug it into are essential.                                                                                                          Packages may make sense.                                                                                                          If the mere thought of computers sends chills down yourspine, you might consider buying a ready-to-use computerpackage. Any one of several IBM-compatibles can simply beplugged in and turned on. Even the software is preloaded. Ifyou know which end of a screwdriver goes in the screw, youcan probably do this.   The IBM PS/1, available in 386SX or 80286 processorversions, comes with Microsoft Works, an integrated softwarepackage with a word processor, spreadsheet, communicationssoftware, data base, and tutorial. A PS/1 386SX C42 with aVGA color monitor, modem and 40 megabyte hard disk costsabout $1,400; the B82 version costs about $1,900 and offersan 80 megabyte hard disk and includes Microsoft Windows.Computer pros insist that if a person can't get this up andrunning in 30 minutes, they should sell their car and buy ahorse. (But then, these are guys who could build a car out ofa horse.)   Tandy Corp.'s 1000 RLX, also with a 80286 processor, comeswith Tandy's general-purpose software, plus programs gearedto such household tasks as making shopping lists and storingrecipes. It has built-in game ports and gives specialattention to sound, but offers little room for expansion.   Packard Bell Electronics Inc. also offers preloaded PCs,but with a wider choice of processors and base units than thePS/1 or 1000 RLX. The company's 386SX with a 40 megabyte harddisk, one megabyte of RAM, two floppy disk drives, a2400-baud modem, a reasonable color monitor and graphicalinterface that includes several software packages isavailable for as little as $1,400.                                                                                                          What about the Macintosh world?                                                                                                          The basic Mac Classic can be obtained for about $850 withone megabyte of RAM and no hard disk. With two megabytes ofRAM and a 40 megabyte hard disk it costs about $1,200. Thisis a monochrome-only unit with a small but very sharp screen.   The Macintosh LC is the cheapest color Mac. For about$1,650 you can get one with two megabytes of RAM and a 40megabyte hard disk. The color monitor is an additional $350or so. For $199 you can add a card that will let your LC runthe 10,000 applications written for the six million or soApple IIs still widely used in schools.   A Macintosh IIci is for the power user. With eightmegabytes of RAM, a 105 megabyte hard disk, color monitor,and deluxe keyboard, it is marketed for about $3,700.                                                                                                          Where to buy a PC.                                                                                                          Basic PCs have become a commodity. You can now buy them inconsumer-electronics and department stores, as well as fromtraditional computer stores, mail-order firms and computerwarehouses.   The trend for traditional computer stores is to offerhigh-end systems to businesses, to become more like massmarketers specializing in PCs, or to go out of business.Service from traditional stores varies a great deal.Preconfigured systems supported directly by the manufacturerallow stores without a trained sales staff to sell fairlypowerful PCs. Manufacturers have responded by beefing uptheir phone-support staffs and by providing integratedsystems that are easier for the novice to use.                                                                                                          What about mail-order purchases?                                                                                                          Nearly 20% of home PCs are bought through a mail-orderfirm. Computer makers such as CompuAdd Corp., Dell ComputerCorp., Gateway 2000 Inc., Northgate Computer Systems Inc.,Zeos International Ltd. and many others are prospering in afiercely competitive market because they offer good value andafter-sales support. Some mail-order firms are starting tooffer preloaded application-software packages. If the vendoryou are considering doesn't offer the software you want, theymay talk you through loading any software you buy on yourown.                                                                                                          If you have a problem . . .                                                                                                          The approach to user support -- whom you call if you havea question or a problem -- is changing. The support often isbeing provided directly by the manufacturer rather than thevendor. You should expect a year's guarantee on parts and atleast 90 days for parts and labor. Many mail-order firmsoffer unconditional 30-day moneyback guarantees. Phonesupport should be free. Be sure you know whether you willhave to bring your malfunctioning PC to a store or mail itsomewhere, or if someone will come to your home to pick it upor fix it. If you paid for your PC with a credit card, youmay have additional warranty coverage through the card.                                                                                                          Some other tips.                                                                                                          Don't put your new PC and printer on a card table. Putthem on something sturdy, preferably with a way to vary theheight of the keyboard for the comfort of different users.   A line filter-surge suppressor to protect your equipmentfrom &quot;spikes&quot; in your electrical power supply is cheapinsurance. Laser printers draw as much power as photocopiers; the Hewlett Packard III, for instance, can draw upto eight amps. Your color monitor draws as much power as acolor TV. Be sure your wiring is up to this, and always usegrounded outlets for computer equipment. Register yourequipment and software with the manufacturer, and record themodel and serial numbers. And save your receipts for wheneverything goes wrong.   ---   Mr. Lemmer is senior news systems analyst for The WallStreet Journal in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
