In Kiryat Malachi, police detained three teen-age Jews who threwa firebomb at an Arab vehicle, Israel radio reported. It said thedevice exploded on the road, causing no injuries or damage.   Arab reports from the Gaza Strip said army gunfire wounded 11Palestinians and soldiers injured three children with rubberbullets, including an 11-year-old shot in the left eye. In the WestBank, two Palestinians were reported wounded.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told Memorial Day ceremony Mondaynight: ``Arab terrorism has reached new heights of violence andmurderousness against the Israeli people.''   He accused leaders of the Palestinian uprising of escalatingviolence to sabotage his election proposal for the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip. The uprising is entering its 18th month.   Shamir wants Palestinians elected in the occupied lands tonegotiate a temporary peace settlement. The Palestine LiberationOrganization says elections only can be held after Israel withdrawsand as part of a comprehensive peace plan.   The army clamped an indefinite curfew on 700,000 Palestinians inGaza Strip and barred 1 million West Bank residents from enteringIsrael until Wednesday night. The restrictions were imposed to keepPalestinians out during Israel's Memorial and Independence Dayholidays.   Between sunset Monday and Tuesday, Israelis remember the 16,740soldiers killed in wars with its Arab enemies. Celebrations markingthe 41st anniversary of Israel's independence begin sundown Tuesdayand end at sundown Wednesday.   Earlier Monday, dozens of Israelis stoned Arab-owned cars alongthe main coastal highway to protest the slaying of Avi Sassportaz,a 21-year-old soldier whose body was discovered Sunday buried in afield near the Gaza Strip.   Before Sassportaz's funeral Monday, police fired tear gas todisperse hundreds of residents from the soldier's hometown, Ashdod,who burned tires in the streets and screamed: ``Death to theArabs!'' and ``No more Arabs in Israel!''   Police arrested protesters from three vans, but stone-throwingriots continued into the night, at one point involving hundreds ofresidents, Israel Television said.   Police warned against planned Tuesday protests.   ``We will not permit any disturbances. We shall have forces thatwill allow us to respond immediately and efficiently,'' said localpolice commander Tuvia Golan.   Thousands attended the funeral, including Defense MinisterYitzhak Rabin and Maj. Gen. Dan Shomron, the chief of staff.Journalists were barred by the family.   In northern Israel, hundreds of Israeli Arab vacationersabruptly left resort towns when the news spread that Sassportaz'body had been discovered, a senior police commander said.   The soldier disappeared Feb. 16 while hitchhiking home from hisarmy base. On Monday, more than 1,400 troops searched for a secondmissing soldier, Ilan Saadon, 18, who last was seen Wednesdayhitching a ride in southern Israel.   Police say they suspect Palestinians were involved in both cases.   ``We are losing our patience,'' Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, armycommander of the Gaza Strip, was quoted as saying by Hadashotnewspaper. ``We will take a heavier hand so they won't reach asituation of making our lives intolerable.''   In an editorial, Hadashot wrote: ``We are nearing the hour whena society that feels itself threatened will choose its securityfirst, as in, `He who rises to kill you, kill him first.' We appealto the Palestinians, `Don't drag us to this moment.'''</TEXT></DOC>
