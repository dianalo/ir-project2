The 85-11 Senate vote followed the 376-45 vote in the House last month. President Reagan is almost certain to sign the measure, even though it is nearly identical to the one he vetoed earlier.    Driven by election-year politics, both Democrats and Republicans finally embraced the 1,000-page bill, which was largely stripped of the protectionism it first contained. While congressional Democrats have pushed the trade legislation, Republicans and business now are eager to see it enacted, because it would provide trade benefits to domestic industries and toughen the U.S. stance on unfair imports.    &quot;We are telling the world, watch out, America is on its way back,&quot; said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) after the vote. &quot;This is going to open up foreign markets to U.S. products,&quot; added Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), who supervised the legislation in the Senate.    Big winners in the trade bill include high-technology companies, the oil industry, agriculture and export business in general. With the strong special-interest support from big-business groups and labor unions, the trade bill hurts very few segments of domestic industry. The bill will leave out in the cold the issue of import relief to dying industries that can't show they can regain competitiveness. And it will limit sales to the U.S. by Japan's Toshiba Corp.    But all the goodies persuaded some previously staunch opponents to vote for the bill yesterday. &quot;Much as it pains me . . . I'm going to vote for this bill,&quot; said Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas), who likes the bill's repeal of the windfall profits tax. &quot;It's the best we could do. It's a compromise.&quot;    After the president vetoed the first version, the bill was stripped of a controversial plant-closing notification requirement and curbs on Alaskan-oil imports. Earlier this week, the president decided not to veto the separate plant-closing bill.    Though the bill is frequently described as the most &quot;sweeping&quot; in many years, and is a huge document, in its final form it doesn't represent any radical shift in modern American trade policy. It contains no significant tariff increases or new quotas and erects no new major trade barriers. In many cases, in fact, it lowers tariffs and gives the president authority to bargain away more levies.    After months of being watered down in negotiations with the White House, the trade bill doesn't stray from the traditional American policy of free markets, nor does it introduce any new curbs on general foreign investment.    &quot;It's not the massive overhaul some tout it to be, but it's not a minor tinkering either,&quot; said William Archey, international vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. &quot;It sends the message that it's not business as usual with our trading partners and it makes trade policy a priority.&quot;    The legislation tightens the process of trade regulation in the U.S. in many ways, so that a future president who is inclined to adopt a laissez-faire attitude toward alleged foreign unfair trade practices will find it harder to do so. And a president inclined to wield a big stick on trade will find new power to do so in the bill.    This &quot;procedural protectionism,&quot; as its critics label it, is a reaction to Mr. Reagan's first term, in which the president made little use of unfair-trading sanctions in the existing law at a time when the trade balance was sinking into the red. Since 1985, the Reagan administration has pressed a flurry of unfair trade cases, and has engineered a massive devaluation of the dollar. As a result, the U.S. trade deficit has begun to slowly shrink, and the political momentum behind the harshest forms of protectionism has diminished.    Treasury Secretary James Baker -- soon to become the chief of Vice President George Bush's presidential campaign -- argues that the trade bill is much better than it was in its original form, and that signing it might preclude worse legislation later. He also believes that Republican hopes in the autumn campaign would be enhanced by a signature, because it would help shield both Mr. Bush and GOP congressional candidates from Democratic charges that they are soft on unfair foreign trade practices.    Mr. Baker is being joined in this argument by White House Chief of Staff Kenneth Duberstein and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. Chief Economic Adviser Beryl Sprinkel, Budget Director James Miller and Secretary of State George Shultz are still opposed to the bill, administration officials say, but they appear to have lost the internal battle.    &quot;I trust that this time the president won't make the mistake of vetoing the bill,&quot; said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), who spearheaded the legislation in the House.    While yesterday's big margin for the trade bill showed a bipartisan consensus, there nevertheless was plenty of political posturing in anticipation of the autumn elections.    Presidential politics were close at hand, as Democrats used the debate to praise Sen. Bentsen's leadership on the trade issue, obviously attempting to score points for Gov. Michael Dukakis's running mate. And Sen. Bentsen was quick to point out that the Democratic presidential candidate vigorously supported the trade and plant-closing legislation.    The Senate rejected several amendments yesterday. But it did approve a separate resolution to strike a provision allowing favorable treatment for ethanol imports from the Caribbean. The resolution, pushed by farm-state lawmakers, instead would permit the favorable treatment only if the imports were deemed necessary to maintain domestic supply. The House, however, is unlikely to approve the resolution in time for it to be added to be bill before the president signs it.    The trade bill, which was identified as a Democratic priority at the start of this congressional session, took many twists and turns. The bill initially was loaded with measures to protect domestic industries. But after the stock market crashed last fall, lawmakers avoided any hint that the bill resembled the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, a protectionist measure that some blame for the Great Depression. And it almost died after the president vetoed it in May.    At the same time, lawmakers, sensing a good political issue and a way to win points back home, flocked to work on the legislation regardless of their position on it. The conference that combined the separate House and Senate versions of the bill, for example, was made up of about 200 lawmakers, divided into 17 working groups.    Here are the major provisions of the legislation:   Unfair Trade Practices   The administration will be required to begin investigations into countries that maintain numerous and pervasive unfair trade barriers. The authority to initiate such &quot;301&quot; cases is transferred to the U.S. trade representative from the president, as is the formal authority to order retaliation. Lawmakers noted, however, that the trade representative serves at the direction of the president and is unlikely to take action he opposes.    The legislation would give the administration some discretion in deciding whether to retaliate and how. The bill doesn't include a controversial amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) that would have directed the president to take action against countries that have huge trade surpluses with the U.S.    Import Relief   There are several significant changes governing federal relief to domestic industries hurt by imports. Industries that currently can qualify for relief merely by showing they are seriously injured by increasing imports will, under the trade bill, also have to show that they are prepared to make a &quot;positive adjustment&quot; to import competition. This means that a dying industry couldn't win relief unless it demonstrated it could become competitive again.    In a significant concession to the Reagan administration, Congress decided to give the administration some discretion in deciding when to grant import relief, permitting relief in ways other than imposing tariffs or quotas on the offending imports. Earlier versions of the trade bill would have required the administration to take action once substantial injury was found. But Congress added a provision saying the administration wouldn't be forced to act if, for example, any action would result in greater economic and social costs than benefits.    The measure also trims or eliminates U.S. duties on a number of products for which there is no source in this country.    Trade Negotiations   The bill grants the executive branch special authority to negotiate in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks now under way and expected to end in 1990. If the next president submits a new world trade pact for ratification by May 31, 1991, Congress will consider it under an expedited system that guarantees quick consideration without amendments.    In general, the administration gets the authority to slash duties as much as 50% as part of the Uruguay Round negotiations.    The bill also grants U.S. approval to a new agreement for harmonizing the system by which countries categorize goods in world trade. This system is designed to make statistics more reliable.    Foreign Takeovers   The president gets the power to block foreign investments that impair U.S. national security. But he can act only if existing review procedures show that an acquisition threatens national security and if the current procedures can't derail or reshape the acquisition. Further, the president can block an acquisition under the trade bill only if no other law -- including antitrust, environmental and defense procurement acts -- can stop it. And the president must cite credible evidence that the foreign party involved is likely to take action that will impair national security.    Dumping   The bill doesn't make major changes in current law covering countervailing duties and dumping. It establishes as a U.S. negotiating goal in trade talks the banning of &quot;diversionary input dumping&quot; -- cases in which finished products imported into the U.S. include materials that were dumped in the country where the finished goods were made. Dumping is selling a product in a foreign market at less than the home-market price or the cost of production. Countervailing duties are aimed at combatting foreign subsidies.    The bill authorizes the Commerce Department to ask other countries to bring their own dumping cases where dumped components are used in finished products sold in the U.S. And to prevent multinational corporations from masking dumping by manipulating prices that various subsidiaries charge each other, the bill authorizes the department to disregard intracompany transfer prices in figuring dumping and to use costs of production instead. It also establishes a method for calculating whether countries with state-run economies are dumping goods in the U.S.    Export Controls   Congress voted to abolish controls on the export of many widely available electronics products to Japan and 14 North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. Since these products, which include personal computers, are subject only to routine licensing, decontrolling this category is expected to reduce paperwork and improve delivery times.    The bill also clarifies the Pentagon's role in reviewing licenses for exports to non-communist countries, stating that the review should be done only for &quot;national security&quot; reasons. Some members of Congress have complained that the Pentagon sometimes blocks U.S. exports on foreign-policy grounds that go beyond its legislative mandate.    Securities Dealers   The legislation bars foreign companies from serving as primary dealers in U.S. government securities unless their governments reciprocate.    The measure is aimed primarily at Japan, and it would force three big Japanese securities firms out of the prestigious business of being primary dealers in U.S. government securities -- if Japan doesn't offer U.S. companies within one year the &quot;same competitive opportunities&quot; Japanese firms enjoy for dealing in that country's government securities.    The Japanese primary dealers that could be affected by the provision are the U.S. units of Nomura Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co. and Daiwa Securities Co. The provision would exempt primary dealers controlled by, or being acquired by, Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd. and Long Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. It also would exempt First Boston Corp., in which Credit Suisse has a major holding.    Primary dealers are elite institutions that deal directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York when it buys and sells government securities as part of its open-market operations. Some large institutional investors will do business only with primary dealers.    Agriculture   Through the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1989, the bill provides $2.5 billion for boosting exports of farm products. This program, aimed at the European Community, subsidizes U.S. farm exports to countries that subsidize their own farm products.    Toshiba Sanctions   The bill bans all imports from Japan's Toshiba Machine Co. for three years in retaliation for that company's illegal sale to the Soviet Union of sophisticated machine tools useful for making submarines quieter. The bill penalizes the parent Toshiba Corp. with a three-year ban on doing business with U.S. government agencies. Toshiba Corp. would save most of its U.S. sales of about $2.5 billion a year, but its subsidiary could lose as much as $300 million over the three-year period, according to legislative estimates.    Federal agencies don't have to honor the Toshiba ban on existing contracts or on items for which Toshiba is the only source.    The bill also prescribes sanctions for foreign companies that commit similar violations in the future. Companies that &quot;knowingly&quot; breach export-control rules could be subject to a two-year to five-year ban on U.S. sales and federal contracting. However, parents of subsidiaries guilty of these violations could be exempted if their governments have a good record of enforcing export regulations and if the parents maintain effective internal controls.    Windfall Profits   The windfall profits tax on domestically produced crude oil is repealed. The tax was designed to capture for the government some of the profits generated when controls were lifted from soaring oil prices in 1980. The repeal, according to proponents, won't result in any lost revenue for the government because oil prices are currently below the level at which companies have to pay anything.    Worker Retraining   One section authorizes $980 million for retraining workers displaced by plant closings or modernization. Workers would be eligible even if their job losses didn't result from imports.    The legislation also expands the assistance programs for workers displaced by imports. It attempts to move from the current cash-benefits program to one of promoting adjustment by making enrollment in retraining programs a condition of receiving benefits. The president is authorized to impose a small import fee to pay for the benefits.    Intellectual Property   The president is directed to act against countries that permit piracy of U.S. &quot;intellectual property.&quot; He must identify countries that don't protect copyrights and patents and initiate expedited unfair-trade investigations in the most egregious cases. The president may decline to act if doing so would be against the national economic interest.    Holders of patents on processes by which products are made, as in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, will be allowed to sue U.S. importers of any products that use their patented processes in a foreign country where the patents aren't protected. Currently, patent-process holders can seek to prevent such products from coming into the U.S., but can't recover damages.    Another provision eliminates a requirement that U.S. patent holders prove they are injured before they can obtain government orders banning imports of products that infringe their patents.    Telecommunications   The president will be required to negotiate with foreign countries to win greater access to their markets for U.S. makers of telecommunications equipment. The provision directs the president to use as leverage in such talks the threat that foreign companies' access to the U.S. telecommunications market could be denied if foreign governments don't reduce barriers to U.S. companies.    Anti-Bribery Law   The 1977 law against corporate bribery of foreign officials is clarified as to what kind of knowledge would make corporate officials liable for bribes made by employees or agents. A U.S. company will be liable for employee violations if top officials ignored indications of improper actions taken on the company's behalf.    The current Foreign Corrupt Practices Act allows so-called grease payments to facilitate certain activities such as unloading goods on foreign docks. The trade bill clarifies permissible payments to include reasonable expenses, such as for travel and lodging, associated with selling goods overseas.    Exchange Rates   The bill puts into legislative language current U.S. policies on exchange rates and international economic policy coordination. It requires the U.S. to hold multilateral talks with other major nations to improve both coordination of economic policies and existing mechanisms for stabilizing exchange rates. In addition, the U.S. must hold talks on exchange rates with any country that runs trade surpluses with the U.S. and the rest of the world and that the U.S. believes is manipulating its exchange rates. Annual reports to Congress would be required on how the two types of talks are going.    Third World Debt   The Treasury secretary is directed to open discussions with other countries on the possibility of creating a special &quot;debt facility&quot; -- an entity that could purchase Third World debt, swap it, convert it into securities or otherwise act to reduce the debtor countries' debt load. However, the legislation gives the secretary an escape clause by which he can avoid holding such talks, which are opposed by the Reagan administration. The Treasury won't have to conduct the talks if an interim study concludes that such talks would carry a &quot;material risk&quot; of reducing the value of the debt, disrupting debt service, or causing defaults. A final study is required within 12 months of the bill's passage, when a new president will be in office.    The bill also would require the U.S. to ask the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to do new studies examining all the proposed debt-problem solutions.    Competitiveness   The bill attempts to strengthen the Commerce Department's data collection by combining two of its existing data banks -- one that identifies export opportunities and another designed as a policy-making tool -- into a &quot;national trade data bank.&quot; The retooled facility could help U.S. companies compete for overseas sales.    Small Business   The Small Business Administration's Office of International Trade gets increased authority and direction. The SBA will be required to prepare policy options for export-related issues affecting small business, such as expedited trade remedies.    The trade bill increases the lending limit for certain SBA loan programs to $750,000 from $500,000 and allows for loan guarantees of $750,000 to $1 million for trade-oriented industries.    International Consortia   The bill expands U.S. trade laws to allow actions against unfair subsidies to international consortia such as Airbus Industrie, a major competitor of Boeing Co. on commercial aircraft.    U.S. companies currently can seek relief from unfair trade practices when their competition is subsidized by just one country, but not when the subsidies are coming from several foreign nations.    Science and Research   One provision, clearly aimed at Japan, will increase pressure for reciprocity in scientific exchanges with other countries. It provides that agreements establishing such exchanges be negotiated through an interagency process instead of through the State Department, as often has been the case. The interagency format will encourage the government to consider trade and other economic issues in drafting such accords.    The bill also expands the mission of the National Bureau of Standards and renames it the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In addition to retaining its historic role of setting measurement standards, the office will be encouraged to work on leading-edge technologies such as superconductivity, biotechnology and advanced composite materials.    The Commerce Department is instructed to feed the unclassified output of nearly 700 federal laboratories to potential commercial users and to create a clearinghouse for local governments and research institutions to exchange innovative ideas. The bill encourages joint research by groups of companies but leaves to future legislation the extent to which such collaboration can be exempt from antitrust laws.    ---                     Trade Bill Highlights   -- Focuses unfair-trade investigations on countries with consistent patterns of unfair trade practices.   -- Requires domestic companies to make a &quot;positive adjustment&quot; to competition in order to win import relief.   -- Grants negotiating authority for the U.S. to complete, probably in 1990, the current Uruguay Round of world trade talks.   -- Permits the president, in certain circumstances, to block foreign takeovers if he has evidence they would impair national security.   -- Bars foreign securities firms from being primary dealers in U.S. government securities unless U.S. firms gain within a year equal footing with local firms to handle their governments' securities.   -- Requires negotiations with other countries to gain greater access for U.S. telecommunications equipment.   -- Gives a legal mandate for the current U.S. policy of coordinating economic policies and exchange-rate strategies with other major nations.   -- Writes into law the current U.S. practice of negotiating on exchange rates with trade-surplus countries that the U.S. charges manipulate their currencies.   -- Directs the president to initiate expedited unfair-trade actions in certain cases of foreign pirating of U.S. patents and copyrights.   -- Authorizes a $980 million new program for retraining displaced workers, and expands existing programs to help adjustment for workers who lose jobs due to imports.   -- Authorizes further agricultural export subsidies.   -- Reduces or eliminates U.S. duties on dozens of products for which there is no U.S. source.   -- Clarifies current anti-bribery law regarding business activities overseas.   -- Imposes sanctions against Japan's Toshiba Corp. for the sale of sensitive submarine technology to the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
