His own advisers were quick to tell him that it's an impossible goal. But even if a new president could achieve such massive job growth, why should he want to?    Americans have become obsessed with job creation, and it's something that the nation has done very well. During the Reagan presidency, the U.S. economy has cranked out jobs at a rate of two million a year. In the inflation-battered Carter years, it averaged an even higher two-and-a-half million a year. That's a miracle in the eyes of most Europeans, whose own economies haven't seen substantial job growth for over a decade. And it far outshines the Japanese, whose job growth has been less than half that in the U.S.    But counting jobs is not a particularly good way to measure an economy's health. If it were, remarks conservative Clemson University economist Richard McKenzie, &quot;we could pass a one-line statute that would create 60 million jobs overnight: Outlaw farm machinery.&quot;    Liberal economist Barry Bluestone agrees. &quot;We pay homage to this great American jobs machine, and it is a colossal machine,&quot; he says. &quot;But it is unclear what the product is.&quot; Replacing one well-paid job with two poorly paid jobs, he argues, is hardly economic progress.    Indeed, rapid job growth is one reason that the average hourly earnings of American workers have been stagnant for the past two decades. A flood of baby boomers and women entering the work force has made labor plentiful, and left companies with little incentive to boost pay or pursue labor-saving improvements. Earnings have remained low, and so has output per worker. &quot;The high rate of labor-force growth had a deleterious effect on productivity,&quot; says Brookings Institution economist Martin Baily, &quot;particularly because the new entrants didn't have a lot of experience, and many of them were young.&quot;    A look at international trends in output per worker underscores the problem. The U.S. still remains the world's powerhouse, but its lead is slipping rapidly.    The opportunity in the next decade is to reverse that trend. Labor force growth is slowing. Members of the baby boom generation have already found jobs, and the rise in working women has begun to slow. The Department of Labor estimates that the work force will grow at a rate of only 1.2 million per year between now and the year 2000, down from a peak pace of three million in 1978.    As labor becomes scarcer, companies will have to make more efficient use of their workers. Particularly in labor-intensive service industries, managers will have to seek new ways to use technology and better ways to organize their businesses.    The result: Job growth may slow, but productivity would rise. And that means higher earnings and higher standards of living.    Signs of change can already be seen in some businesses. At Manor Care Inc., for instance, Vice President John Riley says his daily challenge is to devise new labor-saving practices at the company's 150 nursing homes across the country. Nurses are already in short supply, and low-skilled employees are becoming scarce as well. &quot;We are looking at each job and trying to figure out how to make it more productive,&quot; says Mr. Riley. Example: making hallways in new facilities shorter so nurses don't have to walk as far.    In the fast-food industry, as well, ambitious efforts are under way. For example, McDonald's has introduced a grill that cooks hamburgers without flipping and PepsiCo is preparing a beverage dispenser that fills cups by computer.    Thus, the real challenge for the new president may prove to be not so much creating jobs as helping companies produce more with fewer workers. In his new book &quot;The Great U-Turn,&quot; Mr. Bluestone argues the government should encourage more productive use of workers by adopting an &quot;industrial policy&quot; that would focus resources on productive industries. Mr. McKenzie, in his new book &quot;The Great American Job Machine,&quot; urges, on the other hand, that the government encourage free trade and avoid measures like the minimum wage or mandated health benefits. As in the past, the nation is likely to steer a course somewhere between such extremes.    Perhaps the most important role for government will be to ensure that American workers have the schooling to take on new and improved jobs. &quot;The potential is definitely there to have a high-productivity economy,&quot; says Paul Osterman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;But it won't happen unless you have better education and training.&quot;    ---                        Losing the Lead                                   OUTPUT PER        GROWTH                               WORKER IN 1987    SINCE 1977 -    U.S.                              $38,896          + 7%    Canada                             37,150          +10    France                             33,171          +23    Germany                            31,546          +18    Japan                              27,508          +35    Korea                              13,280          +63    Source: Council of Economic Advisers.
