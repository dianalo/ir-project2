Layoffs spread. Unemploymentswells.   Yet many companies find themselves in a bafflingpredicament: They still can't find enough qualified workers.</LP><TEXT>   Even companies that are issuing pink slips havehard-to-fill vacancies. National Semiconductor Corp. fireddozens of product engineers when slashing 2,000 workers fromits payroll in recent months. But now it hunts for engineerswith different specialties to fill the bulk of 150 new slots.   Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Corp. plans to trim 2,600 managersand others this year, but currently is searching for amedical underwriter, a budget analyst and a food-servicesupervisor.   &quot;Finding people with the skills you want is just asdifficult as it's always been,&quot; says Philip K. Kocher,Aetna's assistant vice president for corporate staffing.Aetna first evaluates current staff for open positions, butmust look outside, too. &quot;The people we need aren't alwaysgoing to be here,&quot; Mr. Kocher says.   To be sure, the labor shortage isn't as severe or aswidely felt as it was a year or two ago. Then, in a fewregions, competition for people grew so intense thatfast-food outlets were forced to raise starting wages tonearly double the minimum wage. Factories bused in productionworkers from far away. And some companies seeking easieraccess to employees even moved their operations.   Today such measures are less common. Indeed, somecompanies are enjoying unprecedented success in filling jobs-- in part because of fallout from the recession.   &quot;There are lots of good people out there whose companiescollapsed,&quot; says Lauren Sontag, director of training anddevelopment for some 200 New York area Chase Manhattan Corp.bank branches. Despite job cuts at Chase totaling more than5,000 last year, hiring of tellers goes on -- and both thequality and number of applicants are rising, Ms. Sontag says.   Still, many companies are having difficulty filling avariety of slots, especially those requiring technicalaptitude or highly specialized training. Comprehensive dataon shortages don't exist, but electrical and chemicalengineers and computer specialists are among those in heavydemand. At the entry level, fast-changing word-processingtechnology has made it tougher than ever for some employersto find competent secretarial and clerical help. Inmanufacturing, higher-tech production processes are makingeven the most rote of assembly-line jobs harder to fill.   Not that job seekers lack interest. One day earlier thismonth, so many people flooded Xerox Corp.'s Webster, N.Y.,facility in pursuit of 300 new copier-assembly jobs thatofficials &quot;had to go to some Xerox machines to keep up withthe demand&quot; for applications, a spokesman says. But even themore than 3,500 prospects now in hand may barely yield enoughgood candidates. That's because for every 500 applicants,Xerox expects to find just 65 who can pass a battery ofaptitude and other tests. Ten years ago, when its copierswere less complex, Xerox could have filled assembly jobs froma pool one-third the size, a company official says.   That troubling shortages persist when record numbers ofwhite-collar professionals are losing their jobs is somethingof a paradox -- and belies some demographic predictions. Onewidely disseminated study, Workforce 2000, sent shock wavesthrough corporate America several years back with itsforecast that white, male, well-educated workers would be inshort supply. Yet they're among the very people companies arelaying off in record numbers. Meanwhile, the &quot;baby bust&quot; -- ashrinkage of the 18-to-25 age group, the biggest source ofentry-level workers -- has also prompted broad concern. Yetunemployment among baby busters remains relatively high.   So the problem isn't that there aren't enough people outthere, labor specialists say. Rather, they say, there aregrowing gaps between job demands and the skills andexpectations many workers possess.   Indeed, some experts say the term &quot;labor shortage&quot; may bea misnomer. They suggest &quot;skills mismatch&quot; or &quot;expectationsgap&quot; might more accurately describe the quandary manybusinesses face as they show some workers the door while alsostruggling to fill new positions.   &quot;We used to presume that people who were well-educatedwere qualified for all sorts of work,&quot; says Anthony P.Carnevale, chief economist with the American Society forTraining and Development, a trade group. &quot;That's no longerthe case.&quot;   Many managers and junior executives are particularlyill-matched to current demands, labor specialists andcorporate personnel officials say. They say generalmanagement skills are becoming less transferable as companiesthin management ranks and focus their businesses ever morenarrowly.   &quot;If you're a vice president at Chase Manhattan, most ofwhat you know is specific to Chase,&quot; Mr. Carnevale says. &quot;Itwon't help you become a vice president at a hospital.&quot;   Many midlevel managers, salespeople and investment bankerswho lose their jobs lack the qualifications for more senioror more technical positions. Yet many of these same peopleare loath to consider lower-level work they could easilyobtain because they deem it &quot;beneath them&quot; in responsibilityand pay, specialists say.   &quot;What we're seeing is the entitlement principle runningrampant,&quot; says Dan Lacey, a Cleveland consultant who tracksworkplace issues. &quot;Many of the people being cut from the bigcorporations actually believe they were entitled to and worthwhat they were getting. Heaven forbid they should go tosomething that is not prestigious.&quot;   Many teens, too, shun work because the jobs available tothem are &quot;low-paying and not that attractive,&quot; says AnnBartel, a professor at Columbia Business School. Somespecialists, citing soaring turnover rates in the fast-foodand retail industries, also say many businesses find youngworkers unreliable because of &quot;work ethic&quot; problems.   But basic reading, math and analytical skills -- or thelack of them -- are the biggest concern. After only 2,100 of57,000 entry-level job seekers, or 4%, passed its rudimentaryemployment test in 1987, Nynex Corp.'s New York Telephoneunit stepped up &quot;outreach&quot; programs to improve theperformance of graduates from area schools. Still, passingrates haven't edged above 33%.   Skill issues pose a problem for companies fillingsenior-level vacancies, too. Working from a data base listinghundreds of people it let go last year, NationalSemiconductor recently hired back some 16 design and productengineers for one of its facilities. But despite strongcredentials, &quot;many of the others don't fit&quot; now becauseNational is shifting the kinds of chips it makes, says RonZimmerman, director of corporate staffing.   Companies are trying a variety of strategies to findbetter-qualified people, from recruiting more aggressively atcolleges to awarding cash to employees who recommend goodprospects. Many businesses are stepping up in-house training,too. But on top of $30 billion they now spend annually, theAmerican Society for Training and Development says companiesmust devote $15 billion more to keep workers up-to-date withchanging job demands.   To document the extent of staffing problems -- and satisfycuriosity in Congress regarding appropriate immigrationquotas -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics is consideringsurveying national vacancy and turnover levels by occupationand wage rate. Such data on labor demand could eventuallyparallel the supply-side picture offered by the government'sunemployment figures. But, with a pilot vacancy-surveyproject just starting, bureau officials say a full-scaleeffort may be years away.   By that time, experts say, stiffer foreign competition,faster technological change and greater demographic shiftsare likely to create even more profound hiring difficultiesfor companies. &quot;They've got no choice,&quot; Mr. Carnevale says.&quot;Standards will rise, so they'll have to get even betterpeople.&quot;   ---               Labor Imbalance in the U.S.                                                                                                          Occupational specialists in heavy and weak demand, from a1990 labor-market analysis for 193 job categories by MalcolmS.
