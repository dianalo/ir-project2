The firm, which specializes in leveraged buyouts, stated itwould pay $9.25 cash per share for Pullman's 41.9 millionoutstanding shares, or about $387.57 million. Assumption ofexisting debt and expenses will make the total price of the buyoutabout $650 million, Forstmann Little stated.   The buyout was conditioned on Pullman terminating its earlieragreement for a $7.75 per share buyout by a group led by Thomas M.Begel, the company's chairman and chief executive, and HenleyManufacturing Corp., Pullman's biggest shareholder with 9 percentof the company's outstanding shares.   Pullman stock closed unchanged at $9 a share Friday on the NewYork Stock Exchange.   ``I am pleased that Pullman's stockholders will get the benefitof the $9.25 transaction price and am confident that by being oneof the Forstmann Little group of companies, new opportunities willbe provided for Pullman's employees,'' Begel said in a news release.   Pullman, based in Princeton, N.J., is a diversified manufacturerof industrial and engineered component products, including trucktrailers, aircraft seating, food service equipment, weapons systemscomponents, refuse disposal equipment and fluid handling systems.   ``The acquisition of Pullman is an opportunity for ForstmannLittle to purchase a well-managed diverse group of industrialbusinesses, which have strong niche market positions,'' saidNicholas C. Forstmann, a general partner of Forstmann Little.   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly withborrowed funds that are repaid with money raised by the targetcompany's cash flow or the sale of its assets.   The Begel group had planned to sell a number of Pullman'sbusinesses and divisions to pay off debt incurred in its buyout.</TEXT></DOC>
