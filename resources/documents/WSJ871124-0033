After having the weekend to study the details of the White House and congressional accord to trim the budget deficit $76 billion over the next two years, market professionals and foreign investors showed little enthusiasm. As Hugh Johnson, chief economist at First Albany Corp., put it, the market's applause for the package &quot;was less than deafening.&quot;    He and other market professionals note that the process of reducing the deficit has really just begun. The agreement reached in Washington Friday gives the guidelines for tax increases and spending cuts; now Congress must identify the specific programs that will be cut back and what taxes will be raised.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 9.45 points at 1923.08. The industrial average opened lower, showing a loss of about 12 points at 10:30 a.m. But it quickly recovered some ground and traded in a narrow band on either side of Friday's close for the rest of the session until the last hour.    A few buy programs, linked mostly to strategies using stock-index futures, helped lift the industrial average late in the day.    Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.99 to 242.99, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index moved up 0.57 to 136.13. Gainers outnumbered decliners, 903 to 694.    Volume on the Big Board shrank to 143.2 million shares from 189.2 million Friday. But traders said activity was even lighter than indicated by the figures. The 10 most traded issues on the Big Board accounted for 22.8% of yesterday's volume.    More than 21.6 million shares of Northeast Utilities changed hands, making it the most active issue on the Big Board. The stock rose 1/8 to 21 1/4. Traders said investors eager to get the company's coming dividend payment accounted for the surge in volume in this issue. The stock, which carries an 8.3% yield, begins trading ex-dividend today.    Traders believe the market will continue to focus on the action in Washington to trim the deficit. Mr. Johnson at First Albany said the accord reached so far is a bit disappointing because the White House and Congress didn't take strong steps to cut spending. He noted that some of the reductions indicated would be achieved through asset sales and tax increases.    Others noted that while the accord opens the door for a meeting between the U.S and its major trading partners, that could still be weeks away. Sid Dorr, a block trader with Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta, said that on a trip to visit European clients last week, he sensed foreign investors are mainly &quot;frustrated over our government's inability to deal with the budget situation.&quot;    Yesterday was the first chance that foreign investors had to react to the deficit accord, but it was a subdued reaction. Traders said there were very few orders from Europe, and they were mostly sell orders. Markets in Japan were closed for a national holiday.    E.F. Hutton jumped 7 1/8 to 27 3/8 on more than 2.1 million shares. The New York-based brokerage firm, which has been the object of takeover rumors for many months, is seeking a merger partner or a substantial cash infusion.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings said it had been contacted by Hutton regarding a possible merger and it plans to begin merger talks soon. Hutton turned down an offer from Shearson earlier this year. Shearson's stock rose 3/4 to 15 1/2.    Other brokerage stocks were mostly higher: Salomon rose 1 1/8 to 18 7/8, PaineWebber Group moved up 2 3/8 to 18, Merrill Lynch gained 1 1/8 to 22, Bear Stearns added 1 1/8 to 11 5/8, and First Boston increased 7/8 to 24 1/8. Morgan Stanley, however, eased 1/8 to 48 3/8.    Traders said there wasn't much aggressive demand for the brokerage stocks, noting that most rose on light volume. But not all investors are turning away from these issues.    James Schmidt, a managing director at Tucker Anthony Management in Boston, said that despite a bleak earnings outlook for these firms, brokerage stocks are rather attractive right now because many are selling at or below book value. He points out that book value has some relevance for these stocks because it presents where the firms can be liquidated.    He added that with the Federal Reserve moving toward allowing banks to have greater participation in the securities business, some of the regional brokers with strong market positions might be attractive takeover targets for large commercial banks.    Santa Fe Southern Pacific rose 1 7/8 to 51 3/4. After the market closed, Kansas City Southern Industries confirmed that it had submitted a formal proposal to acquire the Southern Pacific Transportation unit from Santa Fe. Kansas City Southern rose 1/8 to 39 3/8.    On the American Stock Exchange, Arundel surged 10 5/8 to 34 1/2 after news that the Baltimore-based construction and materials company agreed to be acquired by a unit of Florida Rock Industries at $40 a share. Florida Rock inched up 1/8 to 18 1/2.    Coca-Cola Enterprises added 3/8 to 14 1/8. The company joined the long list of corporations buying back their stock since the crash, saying it plans to purchase as many as 2.5 million shares. The firm also said it expects to have $1 billion in excess cash flow in the next five years, which it will use primarily to make acquisitions.    Chrysler slipped 1/2 to 22 1/2. The auto maker changed its 1988 first-quarter production levels at various plants, increasing production at some plants and cutting back at others, following last week's review of its production schedule and current market conditions.    Other auto stocks were mixed. General Motors was down 1/2 to 60 1/8, and Ford Motor rose 1/4 to 75 3/4.    Oxford First gained 1 5/8 to 12. An investor group including Leucadia National, a New York holding company, said it holds a 7.8% stake in Oxford First and may seek control of the company.    Maxus Energy, formerly Diamond Shamrock, filed a suit in Texas state court seeking actual damages of more than $300 million from Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., Martin A. Siegel and Ivan F. Boesky. The company alleged that Mr. Siegel, who was then employed by Kidder, leaked confidential information about Diamond Shamrock's 1983 acquisition of Natomas Co. Maxus Energy eased 1/8 to 7 3/8. </TEXT></DOC>
