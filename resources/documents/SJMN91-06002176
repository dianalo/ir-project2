Other maximum medians were $40,000 forthe down payment and $1,300 for the monthly payment.;    The survey, by FultonResearch Inc., of Fairfax, Va., was based on interviews with shoppers whovisited sample homes in new-home developments. It was the 13th such survey inBuilder's series.;    George Fulton, president of Fulton Research, said therecent group of would-be home buyers were different from those he met andinterviewed in 1988.;    &quot;Then, buyers were willing to accept and makeconcessions,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, the role is reversed. It's builders who have tomake the concessions. We're also seeing a reorientation in the price they arewilling to pay. Many buyers are really stretched out (financially). I see alot of retooling among builders, moving toward 1,800-to-2,400-square-foothomes, instead of the 3,000-plus market.&quot;;    The surveys are aimed primarilyat helping builders track buyer preferences, but they also offer insights forhomeowners who want to follow trends when making improvements or those who buya home with the goal of reselling in a few years.;    For example, featuresthat appeal strongly to buyers include double-pane windows (thermal windows),bay windows, special-shaped windows, outdoor security lighting, rear decks orpatios, upgraded landscaping and rear-yard fencing, wood-burning fireplaces,French doors, built-in shelving and ceiling moldings. Decks and patios aremore popular than porches, including screened porches.;    Sun rooms andthree-car garages also are popular, and more than one-third of the would-bebuyers said they would pay extra for them. Only 7 percent of the buyers saidthey would pay extra for a media room, once thought to be a big attraction tobuyers. An exercise room or fitness center would lure 19 percent into forkingover extra money, and 23 percent would pay extra for a home office.;    Thesurvey also found that aluminum siding was still preferred over vinyl by morewould-be buyers (32 percent favored aluminum to 28 percent for vinyl). Withyounger buyers, the preference for aluminum was even stronger.;    A commuteof 16 to 30 minutes was acceptable to 43 percent of the group, but only 27percent said they would commute 31 to 45 minutes, and a commute of 40 to 60minutes was acceptable to only 20 percent. Just 4 percent said they werewilling to commute more than 60 minutes.;    Most of those surveyed said theywanted a new home to please their families and themselves and were not greatlyconcerned about what friends thought of it. Only 24 percent said friends'opinions were very important. Also, 12 percent thought their home needed to beglamorous, and 22 percent wanted the home to be good for entertaining.;   Land prices were blamed by 71 percent of the group for the scarcity ofaffordable housing, while 42 percent said that mortgage interest rates were akey factor, and 41 percent blamed taxes. Only 20 percent thought excessiveregulations were a big factor in housing costs.;    A final statistic, whichFulton conceded had nothing to do with housing: More would-be buyers droveAmerican-made cars than foreign cars, and sedans were the favorite type ofcar. Shoppers who drove sports cars were most likely to favor contemporaryhome designs.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GENE AUSTIN, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910102  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  771  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 2, 199100002176,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
