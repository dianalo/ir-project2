JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The likelihood of injury from a car accidentranges widely among different car models, but for the most partsafety increases with automobile size, according to an insuranceindustry report.   The report on injury claims involving 207 popular models showsthat small cars have by far the highest injury loss records, whilestation wagons and large cars often afford the greatest protection.   According to the insurance group, the Mercedes-Benz SDL-SELsedan, which is equipped with a driver-side airbag, had the bestsafety record with injury losses that were 58 percent lower thanthe average for all cars. Close behind was the Pontiac Safaristation wagon.   The least safe car was the 4-door Chevrolet Spectrum which hadinjury losses that were 78 percent above average, followed by the4-door Chevrolet Sprint and 4-door Hyundai Excel, both of which hadlosses 67 percent above average, the report said.   Of the 10 cars with the best injury loss record, nine werecategorized as ``large'' cars including five station wagons andvans. The Saab 9000 was the only ``mid-size'' car in the top 10vehicles, ranking fifth best with injury losses 51 percent lowerthan average.   The 10 vehicles with the worst injury loss record were all inthe small sedan or small sports car category.   Exceptions to the general trend that small cars afford the leastprotection include another Saab model, the Saab 900, as well as theVolkswagen Vanagon, the Toyota van, Porsche 944 coupe and MercedesBenz 380-560 SL convertible. All are in the ``small'' category buthad better than average injury loss records.   But except for the Saab 900, all 60 of the ``small'' sedanmodels had higher injury losses than average.   The report by the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insuranceindustry research group, covered 1985-87 model cars, but spokesmensaid the findings can be used as a guide for later model vehiclesas well.   ``The loss experience of most cars is consistent from one modelyear to another,'' said Brian O'Neill, the institute's president.   The report said the results were adjusted to take into accountvarious ``non-vehicle factors'' such as types and ages of driversthat might be associated with particular vehicles.   The 2-door Chevrolet Cavalier was the only mid-size car to have``substantially worse than average'' injury losses _ 36 percentworse than average for all vehicles.   All but two of the 35 ``large'' cars, station wagons, vans andspeciality cars had lower than average injury losses. The 4-doorOldsmobile Delta 88 and Cadillac Fleetwood-Deville were theexceptions, ranked as average.   Of the 207 cars and vans included in the study, 40 had safetyrecords that were characterized as ``substantially better'' thanaverage, while 32 were ``substantially worse.''</TEXT></DOC>
