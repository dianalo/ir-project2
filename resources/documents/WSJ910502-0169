The finding, by British researchers, was first reportedlast year in a U.S. physics journal, Applied Physics Letters.But it got little attention until it was replicated by otherscientists, including a group at American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co.'s Bell Laboratories two months ago, said JohnBean, an ATandamp;T researcher. Growing excitement about thediscovery prompted the Materials Research Society, aprofessional group, to schedule a special session on it thisevening at a general meeting of the society in Anaheim,Calif.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I was convinced {the British researchers} were completelywrong,&quot; said Henryk Temkin, a Bell Laboratories researcher.&quot;But it really works as advertised.&quot;   Computer and communications technologies that use light tocarry information offer a number of potential advantages overtraditional electronic devices, which use electrons. Lightbeams piped through glass-like fiber-optic strands can carrymore information more quickly than can electrons traveling inwires. Moreover, light beams don't interfere with each other,potentially enabling researchers to interconnect arrays ofcomputing devices without a maze of wires -- which, in turn,might lead to shoebox-sized supercomputers and other newtechnologies.   But scientists haven't yet found a good way to incorporatemany tiny optical components into chip-like integratedcircuits. The silicon traditionally used in the chips can'teffectively transmit light, and light-emitting materials suchas gallium arsenide are costly, tricky to make and don't meshwell with silicon. The latest advance may help overcome thisproblem by paving the way for &quot;optoelectronics&quot; based oncheap silicon.   The British researchers, at the U.K. Ministry of Defense'sRoyal Signals and Radar Establishment in Malvern, England,used an acid-etching process to carve holes in silicon. Theprocess created thin wire-like structures that have differentoptical properties from normal silicon. In particular, whengreen light from a laser is shone on such &quot;porous&quot; silicon,it emits red light, said Bell Laboratories' Mr. Bean.   Although the advance opens the door for silicon-basedoptical devices, a number of hurdles still must be overcometo develop them, Mr. Bean cautioned. Porous silicon, becauseof its fine structure, may be unstable in air and difficultto work with. Additionally, scientists must find ways toinduce silicon light emissions with electrons rather thanlaser light to marry electronic and optical devices. Untilthat happens, said ATandamp;T's Mr. Temkin, porous silicon willremain &quot;a toy.&quot;   Still, the discovery that silicon can emit light is &quot;veryexciting,&quot; said Margaret Stern, an optoelectronics expert atMassachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory.&quot;My educated guess is that you can get electrically inducedlight emission&quot; with porous silicon, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
