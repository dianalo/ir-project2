(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Digital NASandM;DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING environments and the client/server model have a raiseda number of challenges for vendors and users.andP;  Foremost among these is thatof actually delivering on the promise of distributed computing withoutretarding the application development process because of the increasedcomplexity of writing for a networked, multivendor environment.andM;Furthermore, increasing requirements for fundamental interconnection andinteroperability in such a multi-platform network environment raise adifficult question for vendors: Where do they add their distinctive value?andM;Putting this another way: where does it make sense to apply the most effortand resources in product development?andP;  (We should recognize that a certainamount of effort will always be required for performance optimization andquality.)andM;Increasingly, the answer to both questions seems to lie in the quality andnumber of the services a vendor offers to enable the distributed computingenvironment.andP;  There are two general areas for these services:andM;* Common programming interfaces to a well-defined standard for multipleplatforms.andM;* Common programming interfaces to a network function that, as yet, has nowell-accepted standard.andP;  In this case, vendors must maintain the programminginterface if it becomes necessary to swap out the underlying function infavor of a future standard.andM;It will be years before a complete distributed network services solution evenapproaches complete standardization.andP;  As an example, consider the role playedby the Open Software Foundation Distributed Computing Environment (OSF DCE).andO;While OSF DCE is specifying very fundamental enablers for the network, it isstill lacking many higher-level network services.andP;  Vendors must fill in thegaps.andP;  As the level of standardization rises, vendors must go with the flowand provide increasingly sophisticated tools and interfaces.andM;Digital Equipment's Network Application Support (NAS) prograim is exemplaryin its approach to delivering the set of services needed to implementmulti-platform distributed network computing.andP;  As such, it is strategicallyfundamental to Digital's future success.andP;  Digital has been steadily fleshingout the NAS program during the past few years, even though the program hasnot had a high profile outside of the company.andP;  Digital has greatly steppedup its marketing activities in this area during the last year, however.andM;At this point, Digital has a solid offering of base services and is beginningto push into more advanced areas that presage the delivery ofobject-oriented, distributed application environments.andP;  We will survey therange of NAS services in this report, with special emphasis on three of thenewest NAS members: DECmessageQ, Application Control Architecture (ACA), andthe DCE offering.andM;NAS ModelandM;NAS is a very broad platform that defines an architecture and deliversservices for the multi-platform network computing environment.andP;  In keepingwith Digital's habit, NAS implements international standards where possible.andO;In areas with no definitive standard or standards, Digital innovates asclosely as possible to the expected direction of future standards.andM;Specifically, NAS provides:andM;* A model of application interaction (Digital calls this the applicationdialogue.)andM;* A set of interface standards for the application interactionandM;* Services to support the interface standardsandM;In the NAS model, applications carry on this dialogue in four major areas:with users, with data, with other applications, and with the underlyingsystem.andP;  The concept of application dialogue is not new.andP;  Digital, however,has done more than other vendors to generalize this model to anon-platform-specific environment.andP;  NAS standardizes only the ApplicationProgramming Interfaces (APIs).andP;  The APIs specify a platform-independentcalling sequence required to invoke a specific service in a specifiedenvironment.andP;  By writing to the API, the developer is freed from the burdenof rewriting applications for specific platforms.andM;TAXONOMY.andP;  Digital categorizes the four dialogue areas as follows:andM;* Application access services handle the dialogue with the users.andP;  Theseservices include all the forms of the user interface--windows, forms,terminals, and graphics.andP;  Application Access is not the same as the newApplication Control Services (ACS).andP;  ACS is a key new element we'll spend agreat deal more time on below.andP;  ACS will allow users to integrate a varietyof applications and data types on screen in compound documents/objects.andP;  ACSis a precursor of multivendor distributed object management.andM;* Information- and resource-sharing services encompass the data dialogue.andO;These services span both low-level access to files and high-level access tostructured information, such as a compound document.andM;* Communications and control services handle communication with otherapplications through standard protocols, services, and procedures.andM;* System access services manage the system dialogue and offer access toglobal services such as naming, time, and threads.andM;Application Access ServicesandM;Digital currently subdivides the Application Access Services into fourproduct areas: windowing services, forms services, terminal services, andgraphics services.andM;WINDOWING SERVICES.andP;  DECwindows/Motif is probably one of the best known ofthe NAS services.andP;  Based on the X Window System from MIT, DECwindows is anetwork windowing system based on a client/server model.andP;  (We're not going tospend time here on the basics of X.)andM;Digital was one of the major contributers to the OSF Motif windowingenvironment; however, it has yet to fully migrate DECwindows over to theMotif technology.andP;  Motif consists of an API, an implementation method, and astandard look and feel (behavior).andP;  Digital offers Motif as an alternative tothe standard DECwindows X User Interface (XUI) component.andP;  Customerscurrently can select either the Motif window manager or XUI, and they will beable to run XUI applications within the OSF/Motif window manager.andP;  Digitalplans for Motif to be the default user interface at some point in the future.andM;Although X is a standard, it is a very low-level one that is not concernedwith the physical look or the way interactions occur with an application (thefeel).andP;  A variety of toolkits have appeared to help developers speed theapplication-writing process.andP;  Motif is one such toolkit; XUI is another.andP;  Anapplication user interface written using the Digital User Interface Language(UIL) will run only on XUI libraries.andP;  Similarly, an application using theMotif version of UIL would require the Motif toolkit.andP;  Obviously, this is aproblem in a multivendor environment, where you might want to run the sameapplication on an HP or an IBM workstation as well.andM;This is becoming less of a problem, since most of the major vendors havestrategies that make Motif the user interface of choice.andP;  There are alsotools available to help move many existing applications to Motif.andP;  In anycase, the network-based nature of X allows applications to continue to run ontheir native systems and to be displayed to the desktop, albeit withinconsistent look and feel.andM;The appropriate solution among Motif-supporting vendors would be to use theMotif version of the UIL.andP;  The more portable Motif library calls differ fromthe original Digital calls, however.andP;  Fortunately, Digital supplies a set ofporting filters to convert UIL files to Motif.andP;  (Not that the filterseliminate all developer work, but they certainly cut down on the timerequired.)andM;That still leaves OpenLook users out in the cold, however.andP;  Ideally, anapplication developer should be able to write an application and have it runin the appropriate X-based environment: Motif or OpenLook.andP;  One way toachieve this is through the delivery of a &quot;virtual API&quot;--a set of layeredsoftware to which developers would write, that layer, in turn, handling theinteraction with multiple environments.andP;  Although such a development issomewhat in the spirit of NAS, we would prefer to see a fundamentalaccommodation made in the basic X offering that would more easily supporteither of the two major interface options.andP;  This would become particularlyuseful in emerging enhancements such as drag-and-drop.andM;DECwindows currently supports the VMS and Ultrix environments.andP;  Digitaloffers an X Server for the PC and the Macintosh, allowing them to display Xapplications running on VMS or Ultrix systems.andP;  Support for OS/2 is coming.andM;FORMS SERVICES.andP;  DECforms provides a set of development tools and a run-timeenvironment for a forms-based interface.andP;  DECforms integrates text andgraphics into simple forms and menus.andM;DECforms currently is integrated with VAX ACMS, thereby providing aforms-based interface for transaction processing.andP;  ACMS is a TP monitor forRdb, allowing multiple clients to share the same process.andP;  Currently,DECforms is offered only on VMS.andP;  Other workstations have access to DECformsthrough character-based terminal emulation.andP;  Digital plans to make DECforms acommon user interface environment across multiple platforms.andM;The forms interface is external to the application program.andP;  The formcontains terminal management functions, providing device independence for thesupported application.andP;  Digital has implemented some character-based analogsto DECwindows menus, icons, buttons, and so on--very much like IBM'scharacter-based implementations of the SAA Common User Access (CUA)interface.andM;A panel editor allows users to assemble form elements graphically.andO;Independent Form Description Language (FIDL) statements specify theprocedural aspects of the form.andP;  DECforms supports applications written inany language.andM;DECforms provides a record-level programming interface for interaction withthe back-end transaction monitor.andP;  This record-based transfer is a moreefficient means of interacting with the TP monitor than a field-by-fieldmechanism.andP;  Furthermore, DECforms can transfer multiple records in a singlerequest.andM;VAX ACMS uses a private asynchronous call interface for DECforms, allowing asingle DECforms run-time process to control multiple terminals in amultithreaded manner.andM;A single TP monitor request actually consists of multiple forms panels, allcontained in a single DECforms form.andP;  Data returns as a single record onlyafter all data has been gathered and validated, even if that entailsdisplaying multiple panels.andM;As another means of enhancing performance, DECforms maintains any data sentduring a session.andP;  A new request contains only new data, eliminating the needto duplicate data sent earlier to previous records.andM;DECforms is the first commercial implementation of the proposed FormsInterface Management System (FIMS) standard proposed by ANSI and theInternational Standards Organization (ISO).andM;TERMINAL SERVICES.andP;  Terminal services provide a much-needed linkage with theinstalled base of time-shared, character-based applications.andP;  Digital offersVT emulations on VMS, Ultrix, DOS, OS/2, and Macintosh.andP;  VMS and Ultrixterminal emulators are available in DECwindows itself.andP;  SETHOST, a networkvirtual terminal utility, allows a PC to emulate a terminal connected to thehost system.andM;Currently, Digital offers DECnet/SNA terminal emulators only on VMS andUltrix workstations.andP;  A DOS version is in the works.andM;DECnet supports three basic types of workstations to host connectivity:andM;* Through Local Area Transport (LAT) protocol to any local host.andP;  This is thedefault SETHOST protocol, and it is available only for Ethernetconfigurations.andM;* Through CTERM over DECnet to any host in the network.andP;  CTERM is a wide-areavirtual terminal protocol layered on DECnet.andP;  Because it uses the entirestack, it is slower than LAT; it does offer direct access from the PC to theentire enterprise network, however.andP;  CTERM can also function as a localconnect protocol if the target host does not run LAT.andM;* Through a standard asynchronous connection.andM;GRAPHICS SERVICES.andP;  Digital offers three types of graphics library services:DEC GKS for VMS, DEC GKS-3D for VMS and Ultrix, and DEC PHIGS for VMS andUltrix.andP;  All these products support X; DEC PHIGS also supports the PHIGSextension for X-11, PEX.andM;Information- andandM;Resource-SharingandM;ServicesandM;The data access dialogues fall into five categories: compound documentservices, data access services, repository services, file-sharing services,and print services.andM;COMPOUND DOCUMENT SERVICES.andP;  We believe that Digital has done the best job ofall the vendors in articulating the role of the compound document as anetwork service.andP;  Compound documents, particularly in a graphical, networkedenvironment, become much more than a vehicle for publishing.andP;  Compounddocuments become the mechanism through which users can access, integrate,manipulate, and disseminate multiple types of information distributed acrossa multivendor network (see Illustration 5).andP;  This use of a compound documentbecomes even more significant in the context of a network service such as theApplication Control Architecture, which provides a linking and embeddingcapability for dissimilar applications.andM;The Compound Document Service of NAS supports the creation, display,printing, storage, retrieval, processing, and distribution of revisablecompound documents.andP;  Compound Document Architecture (CDA) consists of a setof component architectures and application functions designed to enablecompound document interchange across heterogenous environments.andM;Although there is an international standard for compound documentinterchange--Office Document Architecture (ODA)--Digital rightly opted todesign its own.andP;  ODA in its current incarnation has many problems, among themits lack of flexibility and its support for a limited number of data types.andO;ODA supports the interchange of text, graphics, and image.andP;  It is a complexstandard and requires international agreement on implementation profiles.andO;Furthermore, it is a bit rigid in its definition of acceptable documentformats.andM;Digital designed its own compound document architecture, CDA, which retainsthe ability to interchange documents with ODA but surpasses it infunctionality.andP;  From the beginning, CDA supported the three ODA documentcontent types as well as formatted data--spreadsheet files, in other words.andO;Digital now offers an ODA-to-CDA gateway to enable the full interchange ofODA and CDA documents.andP;  In the future, there may be convergence between ODAand CDA as Digital's representatives in the ISO committees keep pluggingaway.andM;Four sets of products and tools currently implement CDA:andM;* CDA Base Services, consisting of base converters, documentation, viewers,and run-time libraries.andM;* CDA Viewers, which display compound document files on character-cellterminals or in workstation windows, with the amount of data displayeddetermined by the capability of the device.andP;  In other words, while acharacter-cell terminal will display only text, a workstation window willdisplay text and graphics.andM;* DECimage Application Services, consisting of interfaces and libraries forbuilding image applications using images in DDIF format.andM;* CDA Converter Library, an expandable library of converters that is acritical element because it allows CDA to support market-driven standards aswell as those dictated by committee.andP;  Currently, the converter librarysupports:andM;Alternate Format Syntax for ASCII editorsandM;IBM DCAandM;DX WPS-PLUSandM;SGMLandM;Digital Document Interchange Format (DDIF)andM;Lotus WK1andM;DIFandM;Tabular ASCIIandM;CDA Document Table Interchange Format (DTIF)andM;CGMandM;GKSandM;TIFFandM;MacPaintandM;CALCGRD (DECcalc)andM;Third parties are perfectly capable of developing converter libraries.andP;  We'reaware of one such library for Word for Windows conversion coming from asoftware house in Berlin.andP;  Additionally, Digital is busy expanding thelibraries to support major Japanese word processors, such as Ichitaro.andM;CDA is extensible; Digital will be adding support for audio sometime thisyear and will be providing video extensions in the future.andM;Digital includes the base services and viewers with VMS, Ultrix, and OS/2.andO;The converter library and the DECimage Application Services are layeredproducts available for both VMA and Ultrix operating systems.andP;  PC andMacintosh applications can use the Converter Library for two-way conversionto and from CDA-supported formats.andM;Digital has implemented its CDA formats in a growing number of applications:andM;* DECwrite, a compound document editor based on CDA that offers LiveLinksupport as wellandM;* DECchart for business graphicsandM;* DECdecision, a decision support tool with Builder supportandM;* DECpresent, a presentation graphics packageandM;* DECpaintandM;* DECimageandM;* VAXnotes conferencingandM;* VAX VTX videotexandM;The combination of CDA and ACA in two of the application services is a usefulexample of two types of network document service.andP;  CDA is concerned withinterchange; ACA, with application integration.andP;  The two are complimentary.andM;At this point, Digital is the only vendor to have addressed both interchangeand integration from the standpoint of a multivendor network.andP;  While this isa definite plus in the abstract, it doesn't yet address the market reality ofdelivering such a service to off-the-shelf, third-party PC applications.andP;  Atruly successful Digital product family, for example, would provide a way toenable network documents using Microsoft Word for Windows.andM;DATA ACCESS SERVICES.andP;  Digital actually has three services for SQL-based dataaccess: VAX SQL, Ultrix/SQL, and SQL/Services.andP;  (See Illustration 6.)andP;  It isthe last service that truly embodies the client/server model.andP;  SQL/Servicesallows DOS, OS/2, Mac, VMS, and Ultrix clients to access Rdb and IBM's DB2(through a gateway) over DECnet.andM;The full development option for Rdb comes with the API library for theclients supported by SQL/Services.andP;  The server component also comes withevery Rdb/VMS kit.andP;  SQL/Services SQL syntax matches that accepted by thedynamic interface to VAX SQL, allowing programs to formulate and execute SQLstatements at run-time.andM;Client application code links with the API library.andP;  The client requests dataservices with SQL statements using this API.andP;  The server, in turn, submitsSQL statements to Rdb through the dynamic SQL interface.andM;Digital reportedly will be providing a PC client this summer that will hookinto an ACMS transaction processing environment.andP;  This will be a first stepto providing distributed transaction processing.andM;However, IBM, HP, Stratus, Sybase, Informix, Independence Technologies, andJyacc all recently announced their support for an open, distributedtransaction processing system from Transarc.andP;  Transarc, which provided theAndrew File System for the OSF DCE, is using multiple core components of theDCE (RPC and Security) to build its TP technology.andM;To continue to emphasize its proprietary TP technology in the face of theopen Transarc system would run counter to Digital's strategy.andP;  Digital willneed to come up with some way to evolve ACMS to accommodate the Transarcsoftware.andP;  However, this does not contradict ACMS's success.andP;  NTT, forexample, recently selected ACMS as the standard transaction processing APIwithin its Multivendor Integration Architecture (MIA).andP;  That success does notobviate the ultimate need to support something like the Transarc kit.andM;REPOSITORY SERVICES.andP;  Everyone, it seems, is talking about a repository.andO;Digital's is the CDD/Repository.andP;  In addition to providing a facility for theconsistent definition and access of data, the CDD/Repository containsinformation about application design, configuration management, anddevelopment.andM;CDD/Repository is only available on VMS systems, although Digital states itsintention to deliver the service on Ultrix in the future.andP;  For PCs, Digitalplans a client implementation that will provide an interface to andcommunications with the full repository on a remote server.andM;Digital is working on designing A Tools Integration Standard (ATIS).andP;  ATIS,or a counterpart, will provide a platform-independent interface based on anobject-oriented model with type hierarchy and inheritance that will addresswork flow and life cycle control concerns.andP;  The CDD/Repository call interfacewill conform to ATIS.andM;FILE-SHARING SERVICES.andP;  Digital's file services are an amalgam of solutionsfor various platforms.andP;  Through Pathworks, PC and Macintosh clients haveaccess to VMS and Ultrix servers that provide file service, disk service,print service, file transfer, and network management and control.andP;  PCs alsohave access to the All-In-1 File cabinet on VMS systems.andM;Digital offers an NFS implementation on Ultrix; no surprise there, either.andM;And, finally, Digital offers a VMS/Ultrix connection for the sharing of databetween the two environments over TCP/IP.andM;There is no unified distributed file system at this time.andP;  Digital willrectify that with the eventual implementation of the AFS 4.0 WAN distributedfile system that it picked up with the OSF Distributed Computing Environmentoffering.andP;  (Actually, the proper name is the OSF Distributed File System--OSFDFS.)andP;  As we'll discuss later, the implementation of the more advancedservice requires some common advanced integrated network enablers--just thething provided by the OSF suite.andM;PRINT SERVICES.andP;  A strong distributed printing service is fundamental to asuccessful network.andP;  Users face the need to print from a range of systems toa variety of devices.andP;  Print driver management in the DOS world is badenough; add in Unix, and the mixture becomes overwhelming.andM;DECprint is a strong distributed print service based on a client/serverrelationship between applications and printers (see Illustration 7).andP;  Inaddition to the basic PrintServer software, DECprint includes the DistributedQueuing Service, a DECwindows print widget, and a variety of utilities.andM;DECprint will translate ANSI files for printing on PostScript printers andPrintServers, and will also translate from PostScript to sixels for printingon Digital system printers.andM;Digital will be making the Palladium distributed print service software fromProject Athena available on Ultrix.andM;Application CommunicationandM;and ControlandM;Application communication and control is one of the rapidly evolving areas ofnetwork service.andP;  The goal is to enable the transfer and the integration ofdifferent types of data through a variety of mechanisms based on needs of agiven situation.andM;To return to an analogy we've used before: The variety of technologiesavailable for interapplication communication and control are comparable tothe various technologies available in a modern transportation system.andP;  Wehave a need for cars, trucks, trains, ships, and jets, each of which isappropriate for a few jobs, but not for all.andP;  You don't take a 747 down tothe corner pizza store.andP;  (Or, conversely, the pizza store doesn't use atractor-trailer truck to deliver your cheese and mushroom pizza.)andP;  There isan appropriate technology for a particular task.andP;  Much of the challengefacing us right now is deciding what network technology maps to which need.andM;The Distributed Computing Environment establishes one general mechanism fornetwork communication: the remote procedure call (RPC).andP;  Clearly, however,there is a variety of tasks for which an RPC is not appropriate, or whichride on top of the RPC to provide a different level of service.andM;Some of the first NAS services Digital delivered were in this area ofcommunications and control: the messaging services.andP;  Digital continues toexpand its offerings in this category, with two important recentenhancements: DECmessageQ and the Application Control Services.andM;MESSAGING SERVICES.andP;  MAILbus was one of the earlier and more visible of theNAS services.andP;  The MAILbus family includes message transfer services,distributed directory services, message management services, and multivendorconnectivity services.andM;The DEC Message Router provides the routing service within DECnet, and italso is the gateway delivery service.andP;  Message Router uses the Message RouterDirectory Services (DDS), as do Digital's own mail agents (All-In-1 Mail andAll-In-1).andM;Digital currently offers seven different electronic mail gateways:andM;* Message Route VMSmail Gateway, which connects VMSmail users to exchangemail and documents with a MAILbus user agent.andM;* Message Router X.400 Gateway (MRX), which allows a MAILbus agent toexchange messages with other X.400 systems.andP;  MRX converts non-X.400 mailmessages and addresses to the appropriate document type (IA5 text) and X.400message for transfer between dissimilar systems.andM;* Message Router/S Gateway (MRS), which connects to SNADS for the exchange ofmail messages, revisable and final form documents, and DOS files.andP;  MRSconverts outgoing Digital documents to IBM's DCA format for IBM, and incomingIBM DCA document to Digital DX format.andP;  DOS files transfer unchanged.andM;* Message Router/P Gateway (MRP), which support the exchange of messages andrevisable as well as final form documents with IBM PROFS users.andM;* VAX Mailgate, which lets All-In-1 users add an MCI Mail delivery option totheir mail systems.andM;* Ultrix Mail Connection (UMC), which supports the exchange of messages anddocuments with Unix systems.andP;  UMC offers a graphical user interface forworkstation users.andM;* Message Router Telex (MR-Telex), which allows for connection to the Telexnetwork.andM;Digital offers a Message Router Programmer's Kit for third parties wishing toprovide extra gateway solutions.andP;  Joiner and Associates, for example, offersthe Jmail-MHS gateway that provides an MHS gateway to MAILbus.andP;  This, isturn, opens up access to a wide number of PC LAN message systems.andM;Currently, Digital offers All-In-1 mail clients for DOS, VMS, and theMacintosh.andP;  OS/2 and Windows clients are in the works.andP;  Ultrix users relyupon the UMC agent.andM;EDI SERVICES.andP;  Electronic data interchange (EDI) document exchange is aspecialized form of mail-based applications.andP;  EDI services support theinterchange of carefully specified business documents, such as purchaseorders and invoices.andP;  The DEC/EDI service has three components:andM;* Communication Service, which acts as the gateway to EDI through X.40, X.25,or 2780 transport systems.andM;* Translation Service, which converts internal data formats to the EDIFACTand X12 standards and vice versa.andM;* Application Service, which provides a set of documented interface routinesfacilitating the integration of applications with the EDI delivery system.andM;The DEC/EDI server is available only on VMS.andP;  Again, Digital's intention isto provide the same service on Ultrix.andP;  Currently, only VMS has a clientcomponent for this.andM;APPLICATION CONTROL ARCHITECTURE SERVICES.andP;  As we noted above, ACA is anemerging technology with a great deal of significance.andP;  ACA allows users tolink and embed objects and applications within documents of various types.andO;DECdecisions's Builder and DECwrite's LiveLinks provide specificimplementations of ACA technology.andP;  Digital is planning to generalize theservice and make it accessible to applications on multiple platforms.andO;However, ACA is still in its early stages.andP;  Builder is available throughDECdecision on VMS systems.andP;  LiveLink is available through DECwrite andDECimage on VMS and Ultrix systems as well as through DECview-3D andDECdecision on VMS systems.andM;The ACA features are similar in concept to those proposed by Microsoft, withits Object-Linking and -Embedding (OLE) protocols on the desktop.andP;  ACA ismore sophisticated than the OLE technology, however.andM;ACA will provide facilities defining an object-oriented class hierarchy,allowing for the inheritance of attributes and behavior among relatedapplications.andP;  ACA also will dynamically locate and load remote methoddefinitions.andP;  The ACA API will provide access to a common model forapplication interaction, registration, and communication across multipleplatforms.andP;  Key dependencies for ACA will be the RPC and name servicecapabilities of the network.andM;At this point, we begin to see the growing need for an integrated platformfor network distributed computing.andP;  ACA will depend upon the remote procedurecalls and network-wide naming services in the environment.andP;  (SEE Illustration8.)andP;  Digital, indeed, will layer ACA on top of the Distributed ComputingEnvironment services.andM;There are there generic dimensions to the ACA services: control, command, andcommunication.andP;  ACA implements control by locating and linking remoteapplications within the structure of the existing user interface.andP;  This is anextremely important capability.andM;On the command dimension, ACA offers high-level access to the RPC mechanismsthrough an object-oriented application interface.andM;As a result of these first two services, ACA offers a very strong ability tosupport application-to-application communication in the distributed,multi-platform environment.andM;Specifically, ACA services will provide a class database, naming andregistration services, and invocation and communication services.andM;The class database will provide a class definition facility for classes ofobjects, message, methods and attributes.andP;  Digital will provide local accessto the class database to optimize performance and availability.andP;  Local accesswill reduce the number of objects that do not need to be globally available,and it also ensures the availability of the system when the network isunavailable.andP;  As an example, ACA will support common classes for files andfile systems, mail objects, applications, and so on.andM;Naming and Registration services will support the distribution of applicationregistration information across the network.andP;  With transparent naming andregistration facilities, the support for distributed objects becomesfeasible.andP;  The Naming and Registration services will replicate classinformation across the network.andM;Invocation and Communication services utilize peer-to-peer communications toinvoke remote methods.andP;  The ACA Services will marshall and unmarshallparameters, exploit the RPC technology of the DCE to enable heterogeneousnetwork communications, and provide location independence for methods.andP;  Atrun-time, ACA will be sensitive to the location of the requestor, thelocation of the object, and security.andP;  If the particular client supports it,ACA will enable dynamic image loading for maximized responsiveness to theuser.andP;  The ACA invocation schemes are extensible, allowing for the futureintegration of other invocation mechanisms.andM;Digital published the architectural specification in January and plans tomake the services and developer tools available later this year.andP;  The toolswill include a high-level API and scripting tools to develop an end-usersolution.andP;  Digital plans for availability across VMS, Ultrix, OS/2, and DOS.andM;For success, Digital needs the industry to recognize ACA as a standardmechanism for application integration, and developers need to write to theACA API.andP;  There is a great deal of competition in this area.andP;  The ObjectManagement Group, for example, is trying to establish standards fordistributed object management, a technology definitely within the scope ofNAS.andP;  Hewlett-Packard will be proposing its own network-based version ofNewWave as an alternative technology.andM;At some point, we expect both the OMG and the OSF to come to agreement,either individually or jointly, on a distributed object management technologyas well as on mechanisms for application (object) integration.andP;  Pushing thisdistributed object management technology down into the area of networkservices, rather than keeping it up on the desktop, seems to be a moresensible route to take.andP;  We expect other vendors, such as HP, to proposesimilar mechanisms for distributed objectt management.andP;  Given Digital'sstrategic emphasis on standards-based network services and its alreadyannounced adoption of the OSF DCE technology, we expect the company toincorporate whatever technology &quot;wins&quot; into NAS.andM;That does not address the issue of Microsoft in this particular area,however.andP;  OLE defines some extensions to DDE and the clipboard that allowsusers to create local compound documents out of various application objects.andO;You could embed a graphic in a text document, for example, and retain theability to edit it simply by clicking on it within the text document.andP;  Or youcould have the graph itself linked to a set of numbers in a spreadsheet.andM;OLE does not deliver full in situ object editing.andP;  Clicking on an embeddedobject launches the appropriate application, which then brings the targetdata up in a window.andP;  Microsoft will be providing OLE support across Windows,Macintosh, and PM.andM;OLE has weaknesses, particularly in distributed object management.andO;Essentially, there is no good persistent mechanism for tracking a link to aremote object.andP;  Should someone else move the remote object you've referenced,for example, you have no way of knowing where it went or what it became.andM;Microsoft recognizes this limitation, and promises to address it with thedevelopment and release of its Object Oriented File System (OOFS).andP;  Even inthe most optimistic of Microsoft's scenarios, this reliance upon OOFS pushesout distributed object support for a minimum of two years.andP;  OLE is not just aMIcrosoft solution; major ISVs such as Lotus, Aldus, and WordPerfect havecontributed to it and are adopting it.andM;The problem for Digital and other systems vendors thus becomes how toaccommodate OLE within their strategic systems offerings.andP;  Ignoring OLEshould not be considered an option.andP;  Ideally, Digital should find a way tomap ACA services with OLE, providing a multisystem umbrella that incorporatesOLE.andP;  Such an approach is the optimum for a system vendor.andM;INTERPROCESS MESSAGE QUEUING.andP;  Much of the recent focus on distributednetwork messaging has zeroed in on the Remote Procedure Call.andP;  While the RPCis an important component of a complete distributed computing solution, thereis a need for other application-to-application mechanisms based on differentneeds.andP;  The RPC, for example, is designed for an immediate request/responsemodel of communication.andP;  It mimics a familiar programming model, but it isnot always appropriate for distributing the modules of an application acrossmultiple platforms, or for interapplication communication.andM;A queued message approach, for example, is an alternative model that is usedin operating systems such as MVS running CICS or IMS.andP;  A process submitsrequests and data for other processes to a queue.andP;  The receiving process thenhandles the messages based on its own schedule.andP;  The submitting process neednot wait for a response.andP;  Another difference is that the message can be sentin both directions; the RPC-based client/server mechanism is acall-and-return mechanism.andM;The chief advantage of this approach is tthe ability of the sender tocontinue processing as soon as it sends the messages.andP;  In a widelydistributed application, this can greatly reduce delays by letting messagingand processing proceed in parallel.andM;In the RPC model, you are notified of the success or the failure of a call.andO;Message-based communication is a little more nebulous.andP;  Rather than going tothe trouble of designing an application to return a message indicatingsuccess (which really replicates the functionalitty of the RPC), users canrely upon a process that monitors and manages the messages.andM;Digital's new DECmessageQ service provides such interprocess message queueingin a distributed multivendor environment.andP;  DECmessageQ functions as whatDigital calls an enterprise-wide &quot;message bus&quot; for routing communicationsacross a network.andM;DECmessageQ offers message recovery services, selective broadcast services,development and management tools, and flexible reception, all accessiblethrough an API.andP;  The API itself is relatively simply, offering 12 calls (5base calls).andP;  Furthermore, once DECmessageQ is implemented across the rangeof NAS platforms, it will provide an integrated communication facility thatspans not only VMS, Ultrix, DOS, and OS/2, but also IBM's SAA hosts via anLU6.2 option.andP;  DECmessageQ will ship in late March.andM;Although the DECmessageQ service seems clearly appropriate for productioncontrol and resource planning in manufacturing, it could also become anappropriate partner for EDI to create a distributed, integrated formsprocessing application.andM;System Resource AccessandM;Until recently, System Access was the thinnest of the NAS offerings,consisting only of the Posix set of interface standards.andP;  Recently, however,Digital announced its intention to incorporate the OSF DCE technologies intothis area of NAS.andM;POSIX.andP;  Digital offers three standards within the NAS implementation ofPosix:andM;* Posix.1 system interface.andP;  The first version of the Posix interface betweenapplication programs and operating systems includes only the C languageinterface.andP;  Future versions of Posix will become language-independent andwill include a C binding as a separate section.andM;* Posix.2 shell command language.andP;  Based on the System V shell, and enhancedwith some Korn shell features, the Posix.2 interface provides access to shellservices, as well as 70 utilities callable from shell scripts or fromapplications.andP;  The Posix.2 standard is due for publication this year.andM;* Posix.3 for conformance testing.andM;Currently, Ultrix conforms to Posix.1 and will conform to Posix.2 when thatis published.andP;  Future versions of VMS will conform to Posix.1 and Posix.2,and both operating systems will use conformance tests defined by Posix.3.andM;DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT.andP;  Digital is implementing the bulk of theOSF DCE technologies as NAS services.andP;  This is a significant event, as it notonly will assist Digital in delivering a consistent set of services withinits own NAS architecture (such as a common distributed file system, forexample), but it is also the mechanism for future multivendor connectivity.andM;We've covered the DCE components in the past, so we won't spend much space onthem here.andP;  We will note, however, that Digital is initially implementingseven DCE technologies (many of which it developed or collaborated indeveloping).andM;* The NCS RPC.andP;  Digital worked with Hewlett-Packard on the NCS RPC, anextension of the Network Computing Architecture RPC to augment itsfunctionality for wide area enterprise use.andM;* DECdns and X.500.andP;  The distributed name service (DECdns) originally was tobe Digital's X.500 solution.andP;  OSF is using Siemens's X.500 as the globaldirectory service and DECdns as the cell name service.andM;* DECdts.andP;  A distributed time service is an important element in coordinatinga distributed network.andP;  Digital developed DECdts.andM;* The Concert MultiThreaded Architecture is another Digital developmentdesigned to provide client-space support for multithreading.andM;* The Security services, based on Kerberos with HP extensions.andM;* Distributed File System, based on Transarc's Andrew File System (AFS) 4.0.andM;* LAN Manager/X support for PC integration.andM;Comments and ConclusionsandM;We believe that Digital has an impressive lead in delivering the requisiteset of network services required by the market.andP;  Unfortunately, it has seemedin the past to have a very difficult time communicating the value of theseservices to the world at large.andP;  That condition is changing, due to somevigorous Digital efforts.andP;  DECworld has become a premier spot for tellingcustomers about NAS.andP;  Currently, 650 vendors are supporting aspects of NASwith some 1,200 applications.andP;  Lumping all the applications together likethis can be a bit misleading, however.andP;  An X Window application doesn't carrythe same level of commitment to NAS as would an application supporting ACA,for example.andP;  Nevertheless, the trent is positive.andM;There is also a mistaken perception on the part of some that NAS is quite VMSoriented.andP;  Illustration 10 shows that this is not quite the case; themajority of NAS services are available on Ultrix.andP;  One of the most importantmissing components appears to be, of course, the repository service.andO;However, some of the NAS components in a given area are different;file-sharing is an excellent example of this.andP;  the multiplicity ofapplications for one type of solution is a left-over from Digital's days ofsegregating Ultrix.andP;  The real benefit will be in delivering to developers acommon API across all platforms that will enable them to create applicationsolutions that are, in turn, transparent to the users.andP;  If Digital ignoresthe Transarc TP software (which would initially be Unix-based) in favor ofstressing its own VMS-based transaction processing solution, it will onlyreinforce the market perception that NAS is a VMS-oriented strategy.andM;We also are a bit discouraged by the number of NAS services that are planned,rather than implemented, for the Macintosh.andP;  True, Digital has implemented anumber of NAS elements on the Mac and has fulfilled its initial commitment toApple linkage.andP;  But the types of services in which we are most interested,such as CDA, ACA, and the queueing services, are, so far, planned, notimplemented.andP;  digital still has a somewhat unique opportunity in its alliancewith Apple.andP;  there is a commonality of installed base between the twocompanies, and sophisticated Mac/digital solutions would play well.andO;Additionally, since no other major vendor is bothering with the Mac at thispoint, Digital has a clear field.andM;The development time for the Mac solutions seems to drag on interminably asDigital labors away in other areas.andP;  Now, this grand window of opportunity isbeginning to close.andP;  Novell, for example, is about to begin shipping itsAppleTalk NLM for NetWare 386, bringing the Macintosh into the embrace of itsgrowing set of distributed computing services.andP;  Microsoft is implementing itsOLE across Macintosh as well as across Windows and PM.andP;  The pieces of anon-Digital solution are falling into place.andP;  None of those approach thetheoretical capability of the NAS solution at this point.andP;  However, Digitalmust begin to pick up its pace and focus on providing the most advanced androbust set of client-side services across all major PCs if it hopes to regainits former luster.andM;Digital has a real opportunity if it can provide a way to support OLE-basedlinking and embedding across a network.andP;  Microsoft will not be a position toprovide that distributed capability for some years.andP;  Were Digital able todeliver such a solution, it would be able to point both to the role ofnetwork services and to its ability to deliver such servces.andP;  Users would beable to construct advanced networ-based information systems using thedominant PC and Macintosh software applications.andM;We believe that Digital absolutely has the right idea; we jusst hope theybegin to pick up the pace on delivering and positioning the results.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
