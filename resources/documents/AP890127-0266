The increase in the gross national product, the broadest measureof economic health, was powered by a big improvement in the U.S.trade deficit and a sharp increase in business capital investment.   The advance occurred even though growth slowed sharply in thefinal three months of the year. From October through December, theGNP grew at a lackluster annual rate of 2 percent, the slowestquarterly performance in two years. Weakness in consumer spendingand business investment held back growth.   The fourth-quarter GNP increase followed a 2.5 percent rise inthe July-September quarter.   Many economists predict these trends will intensify this year andwill result in sharply lower growth for 1989. That would givePresident Bush a major headache because his hopes of lowering thebudget deficit without an increase in taxes rests on expectations ofcontinued strong economic growth.   But Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner, briefing reportersabout the GNP report, said he believed the growth forecasts used inthe Reagan administration budget were realistic. He said some of thesluggishness in the fourth quarter was based on temporary factorsthat would not last into the new year.   Ortner said there were several positive economic developmentsduring 1988.   ``We made significant progress in reducing the trade defict, theunemployment rate dropped to a 14-year low and the stock marketbegan a sustained recovery from its plunge in late 1987,'' he said.   The 3.8 percent GNP increase for 1988 followed a 3.4 percent risein 1987 and was the best showing since a 6.8 percent rise in 1984.   Higher inflation accompanied the increase in growth. An inflationindex tied to the GNP rose by 4.2 percent in 1988, the fastest risein prices since 1982.   The jump in inflation, up from a 1987 price increase of 3.6percent, has set off alarm bells at the Federal Reserve Board, whichhas been driving interest rates higher in an effort to dampen demandand keep inflationary pressures in check.   Bush complained this week that the Fed should not grow soconcerned about fighting inflation that it risks slowing economicgrowth, but many analysts believe the board's inflation-fightingefforts will continue and push interest rates even higher.   The 3.8 percent GNP increase in 1988 was a far cry from what manyanalysts had forecast when the year began. The most pessimistic ofthem had predicted the economy would be in a recession before year'send, brought on by a cutback in consumer spending as a result offears triggered by the October 1987 stock market crash.   Instead, consumers kept right on spending, with personalconsumption purchases rising by 2.8 percent during the whole year.   Almost half of all growth in 1988 came from two related factors _a big improvement in the country's trading performance and thebiggest rise in business investment spending since 1984.   For the year, U.S. exports sales rose a sharp 17.7 percent,offsetting an 8.3 percent increase in imports as the weaker dollarmade American-made goods competitive on overseas markets.   Responding to this increased demand, American businesses boostedspending on new plants and equipment by 9.5 percent, a sharpacceleration from a 2.8 percent rise the previous year.   However, in the fourth quarter the trade deficit began risingagain and business investment actually fell. While analysts arelooking for small improvements in both areas this year, they saygrowth there will not come anywhere near matching the 1988performance.   For that reason, many economists are predicting that 1989 GNPgrowth will be much slower than the 3.8 percent increase in 1988.   The Reagan administration based its fiscal 1990 budget forecaston an estimate that the GNP would grow 3.2 percent in the currentyear. Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, has said the newadministration will accept that economic forecast when Bush submitshis own budget on Feb. 9.   However, private economists believe that growth in 1989 will riseby only 2.7 percent, more than a percentage point lower than the1988 level.   This slowdown will occur despite the fact that the drought willno longer be depressing growth as it did in 1988, when it shaved 0.4percentage point from overall growth. Without the drought, the GNPwould have risen by 4.2 percent in 1988.   The various changes left the GNP at $3.995 trillion for all of1988 after removing the effcts of inflation.</TEXT></DOC>
