On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for Octoberdelivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,fell 10 cents per barrel to close at $15.08 Thursday. Othercontract months also dropped.   Contracts for refined petroleum products finished mixed.Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery rose 0.36 cent tofinish at 44.71 a gallon. The September gasoline contract fell 1.49cents Wednesday, the last trading day before the contract expired.Contracts for other months mostly were lower.   Wholesale heating oil for October rose 0.14 cent to 43.46 centsa gallon while other contract months were mixed.   Analysts said the strength in gasoline and heating oil preventedfurther declines in crude oil. They attributed the recent gains inrefined products to poor refinery economics. Outdated equipment,for example, has lowered refinery capacity, keeping supply anddemand nearly equal, they said.   ``Refining capacity has been pared down to the point whererefiners are having problems just keeping up with day to daydemand,'' said Jayne Ball, a commodity oil broker with Dean WitterReynolds Inc.   Analysts said crude oil recovered from midday lows in responseto reports that the United Arab Emirates would exceed itsproduction quota set by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries.   In recent days, oil futures prices weakened after reports thatOPEC's 13 member nations were exceeding their collective quotas bymore than 3 million barrels.   ``All this overproduction in a market where demand factorshaven't been substantial tends to be a price weakening factor andthe market goes down,'' Ms. Ball said. ``UAE claims it's going tohave production up to 1.9 million barrels per day, more than doubleits quota, which is about 990,000 barrels.''   Ongoing uncertainty about developments between Iran and Iraqalso softened crude prices Thursday, traders said.</TEXT></DOC>
