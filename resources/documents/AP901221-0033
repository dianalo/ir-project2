A communique Thursday from the military joint command saidairplanes that refuse to land for inspection or that change theirroute without notice will be ``captured and-or destroyed.''   The communique said the measure went into effect Tuesday in SanMartin department, where the main coca leaf-growing area in Peru -the Upper Huallaga Valley - is located. Dozens of illegal airstripsare scattered in the valley's dense jungle.   The communique did not say how the airplanes would be tracked.The military is not known to operate any radar stations in thedepartment.   The threat represented what would be the air force's first movetoward taking part in anti-drug efforts. Peru is the world's mainsource of coca leaf.   The semi-processed coca leaf is flown mainly to Colombia, to thenorth, where it is refined into pure cocaine.   The U.S. Embassy in Lima said it had no comment on themilitary's plan.   Washington has been pressuring Peru's military to become moreinvolved in fighting drug trafficking in the Upper Huallaga Valley.   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and Peruvian policeoperate an anti-drug airbase in the valley, but the helicoptersthat fly out of the base attack airstrips and drug laboratories.   The United States offered to refurbish 20 Peruvian air forceplanes to use against drug traffickers, as part of a 36million-dollar military aid agreement, but in September PresidentAlberto Fujimori refused to sign the pact.   He said at the time that more economic assistance must be tiedto the military aid to successfully combat drug trafficking.   Army Gen. Mario Brito, head of the department's military forces,told a Lima newspaper that three fighter planes are alreadystationed in Tarapoto, a jungle city 380 miles north of Lima. Hesaid more airplanes would be moved to the area in the next fewweeks.</TEXT></DOC>
