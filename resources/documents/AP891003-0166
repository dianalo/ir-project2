The Eleventh Party Congress was scheduled for Jan. 27 by aresolution accepted at a one-day meeting of the Central Committee.The committee also called for congress delegates to be electedunder new democratic rules.   The party, officially called the Polish United Workers Party,was established in its current form in 1948.   After crushing election losses this year, party leaders seemdetermined to rename the party and create a broader leftistpolitical organization that would include socialists and socialdemocrats.   ``People from under different shades of the red banner'' shouldbe able to ``find their place in it,'' party Secretary LeszekMiller told the committee Tuesday. The party should become ``opento reality and to the challenges that the future brings,'' he said.   Tomasz Nalec, who represents a reformist club within the party,said the full party meeting should be considered ``the foundingcongress of a new party of democratic socialism.''   Seventy-two percent of party members polled over the past monthfavor changing the party's name, charter and program, according topartial results announced at the plenum's opening. The surveyinvolved more than 1.1 million of the 2.1 million party members.   Officials of the party, seeking to recast its identity sinceoverwhelming losses to Solidarity in June's first-ever democraticparliamentary elections, say it must change to survive.   Politburo member Marian Orzechowski has said the party shouldrename itself the Polish Socialist Party of the Working People.   The key changes are to be made at the congress, expected to bemade up of 1,000 to 2,000 elected delegates under the leadership ofFirst Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski.   A communist official who briefed reporters before the plenum oncondition of anonymity also said another shakeup in the party'sruling Politburo was expected. It would be the second since July.   Miller, discussing preparations for the congress at the plenum,said the party planned open, competitive election campaigns forcongress delegates in order to get the public interested in theparty's affairs.   The party is inviting society to ``create the party with us,''he said, and the party must strive to find an identity which willgive it a popular base.   ``The question is whether the Polish United Workers Party canfulfill the aspirations of the part of Polish society which isleft-leaning,'' he said.   The pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported Tuesdaythat the draft plenum's resolution favored a multi-sector economydominated by development of the state-run economy. The draftopposed privatizing and selling off state enterprises, a chiefeconomic goal of the Solidarity-led government, the newspaper said.   The draft also ``obliges all party cells to create conditionsfor free expression of different views,'' the newspaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
