Edgar Tekere, leader of the Zimbabwe Unity Movement, also saidthe nation should seek a dialogue with neighboring South Africa.   Tekere, 52, was a founder of President Robert Mugabe's ZimbabweAfrican National Union and a secretary-general. But Mugabe firedhim a year ago after Tekere publicly attacked the goverment foralleged widespread corruption.   Tekere formed the Unity Movement in April, and gained supportfrom students, trade union members and farmers disillusioned withunfulfilled promises of reform made when Mugabe led the Britishcolony to independence in 1980.   The Unity Movement has lost five parliamentary by-elections ingovernment strongholds. But it captured sufficient ballots to raisegovernment fears that Tekere could secure a foothold in the150-seat parliament in elections next year.   A date has not been set for the balloting but it must be heldbefore April 18, the nation's 10th anniversary.   Zimbabwe is one of the few Western-style democracies in Africa.But the aim of Mugabe's African National Union has been toestablish a one-party state founded on Marxist-Leninist principles.   The party is to hold a five-day congress beginning Tuesday andthe 4,800 delegates are to debate whether they should stick withtheir goal of creating a one-party state at a time when mostEastern European countries that were Mugabe's role models areadopting democratic reforms.   The African National Union would need the support of two-thirdsof parliament to change to a one-party system.   Tekere said such a system would amount to tyranny.   His platform calls for replacing the presidency with theceremonial post of head of state and a prime minister as thegovernment leader.   ``The executive presidency in Zimbabwe concentrates power in oneindividual and this dangerous consolidation of power in a singleset of hands must be avoided,'' Tekere said at a news conferenceFriday.   He also said Zimbabwe should establish contacts with the rulingwhite minority in South Africa. Tekere said that nation'sgovernment deserved recognition for holding talks with blacknationalists, capped this week by South African President F.W. deKlerk's meeting with Nelson Mandela, leader of the outlawed AfricanNational Congress.   ``Why not take a lead from Mandela?'' Tekere said.   Mugabe's government opposes contacts with South Africa.   The Unity Movement's platform also calls for an economic policybased on a combination of socialism and free enterprise, and aredistribution of land to benefit the nation's 9 million blacks.About a third of the land now is held by the white minority, whichnumbers about 100,000.   A similar program failed under Mugabe's government whenpoliticians bought up most available farms.   Tekere also said Zimbabwe should withdraw its 12,000 troops fromneighboring Mozambique, where they are guarding trade routesagainst attacks by guerrillas of the right-wing Mozambique NationalResistance. Tekere said Zimbabwe should open talks with the rebelsto stop the attacks.</TEXT></DOC>
