Carolco Pictures is backing the rental release of its&quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; with a $10 million marketingcampaign, far above the average budget of $1 million to $2million. With more than 700,000 copies sold to video stores,the movie has become the most stocked rental title ever.   The video arm of News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox studiowill run a &quot;triple hit&quot; network TV ad campaign tosimultaneously pitch three movies being released next month:&quot;Dying Young,&quot; &quot;Point Break&quot; and &quot;Hot Shots]&quot;   Other titles to be promoted heavily include &quot;Thelma andamp;Louise,&quot; &quot;Delirious&quot; and &quot;Life Stinks.&quot;   The rental business, whose revenues are flat this year,will benefit if the recession lifts, says Bruce Apar, editorof the trade magazine Video Business, but &quot;the industry hasother problems isolated from the economy.&quot; Easy growth fromthe spread of VCRs is over, he says, and the longer peopleown their VCRs, the fewer tapes they rent.   Moreover, video sales are growing more popular at theexpense of rentals, and Alexander andamp; Associates, a consultingfirm, says the sales rise has been largely in non-theatricaltapes, such as cooking and sports videos.   Says Mr. Apar: &quot;Advertising isn't going to take care ofthose problems.&quot;                                                                                                          Bruce Willis Is Keeping   Low Profile on New Film                                                                                                          WARREN Beatty and Annette Bening, stars of &quot;Bugsy,&quot; are onthe cover of Vanity Fair. Barbra Streisand, promoting &quot;ThePrince of Tides,&quot; was interviewed on &quot;60 Minutes.&quot; And DustinHoffman, Robin Williams and Steven Spielberg push &quot;Hook&quot; onthe cover of Premiere magazine.   But Bruce Willis, star of the big-budget action flick &quot;TheLast Boy Scout,&quot; set to open Dec. 13, is nowhere to be found.   Warner Bros., in an unusual move for a star-drivenpicture, isn't offering media junkets for reporters to travelto Hollywood and interview Mr. Willis. And he has been thesubject of few articles in movie magazines. People familiarwith the film say Mr. Willis is a bit press-shy in the wakeof his last movie, the bomb &quot;Hudson Hawk.&quot;   Robert Friedman, president of world-wide advertising andpublicity at Warner Bros., says the campaign is &quot;much moreadvertising-driven than publicity-driven.&quot; But he says it wasWarner's idea to forgo junkets, largely because Mr. Willis&quot;has done so many junkets&quot; that he's run out of things totalk about. (Mr. Willis's publicist deferred comment toWarner.)   Mr. Friedman says Mr. Willis and Damon Wayans, the film'sother star, will do some &quot;selective publicity&quot; as the openingdate approaches. For now, trailers are carrying the load.   The low-key approach is all the more surprisingconsidering that the script of &quot;The Last Boy Scout,&quot; about adetective and a former football star who link up to solve amurder, was the talk of the town for several months lastyear. Warner's parent, Time Warner, and David Geffen Co.bought it from writer Shane Black for $1,750,000, then arecord.                                                                                                          AMC Hopes More Trailers   Mean More Business                                                                                                          IF YOU think movie theaters run too many previews ofcoming attractions, stay away from your local AMC theater.   For the next three weeks, AMC Entertainment is running apackage of six trailers, each 30 to 90 seconds long, beforefeatures at most of its theaters. AMC normally shows only twoor three trailers, but it hopes the package will createexcitement about the new films when moviegoing in general hasplunged.   The package has trailers for &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot;&quot;Bugsy,&quot; &quot;Hook,&quot; &quot;JFK,&quot; &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot; and &quot;The Princeof Tides.&quot; The studios specially designed the quickies,one-quarter to one-half the length of regular trailers. AMChad planned to include &quot;My Girl&quot; and &quot;An American Tail:Fievel Goes West,&quot; but the studios weren't happy with shortertrailers for those films.   AMC has suspended its usual preludes, cartoons or &quot;ReelNews&quot; from Cable News Network through Christmas Eve on 1,500of the chain's 1,603 screens. Jack Holland, vice president ofmarketing, says, &quot;We're trying to do everything we can to getpeople back out to the movies.&quot;   The promotion is endorsed by four major studios, part of aHollywood trend toward mutual support this holiday season.Many executives have said publicly that they hope everystudio's films do well, reasoning that the greater the numberof hits, the greater the interest in moviegoing.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          PRODUCT placement executives and advertisers have formedthe Entertainment Resources and Marketing Association, atrade group, to develop standards and improve the image ofproduct placement in films and TV shows. So far, itsmembership numbers 15 product-placement firms and twoadvertisers, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph andAnheuser-Busch . . . .
