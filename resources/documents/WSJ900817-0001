The patchwork pattern emerged from a regional study by theConfederation of British Industry and Business StrategiesLtd. Based on a survey of manufacturers throughout the U.K.,the two organizations found that the government's policy ofhigh interest rates has had divergent effects on investmentplans, output expectations and export orders.</LP><TEXT>   The pattern stands in contrast to the one-time north-southdivide, in which northern Britain chronically trailed themore prosperous south. So far at least, northern England,Scotland, and Northern Ireland seem to have staved off themost damaging effects of the economic downturn.   London and the southeast have been dragged down fasterthan the rest of the U.K. Business optimism there has fallenfurther than in any other region. Manufacturers in the areaalso reported the lowest level of capacity utilization in theU.K. Although the southeast is also home to many servicecompanies, such concerns often depend on business fromtraditional industries and have suffered with the slump inmanufacturing.   Consumers in the southeast have saved less and borrowedmore than their counterparts in the north, CBI economistssaid. As a result, the last year of interest-rate increaseshas hit them harder.   Costs of materials and parts have risen, but weakeningdemand has made it difficult to increase prices of finishedmanufactured goods. As a result, manufacturers in thesoutheast reported that their profit margins have beensqueezed.   The West Midlands, where the U.K.'s auto industry isconcentrated, showed the gloomiest prospects for expandedoutput. Sluggish demand for automobiles hit not only carproducers but metal companies and engineering concerns thatserve the industry. Companies in the region expect fallingoutput and rising unemployment in the next four months.Unsurprisingly, capital investment in the region hasslackened and is expected to fall off further, according tothe survey.   Economic optimism was relatively strong in the province ofNorthern Ireland, despite the chronic sectarian conflictthere. The survey showed that exports have been growing andoutput has expanded. The level of planned investment inplants and machinery in Northern Ireland is higher than inany other region in the U.K.   Companies surveyed in Scotland have been hurt by weakdemand at home, but they reported relatively healthy levelsof export orders. In recent months, manufacturing output inScotland has risen, and the number of firms operating belowfull capacity has fallen.   Though they were affected in varying degrees, firms in allthe regions said they have been pinched by the currently highinterest rates. In an effort to wring inflation out of theeconomy, the Thatcher government has increased base interestrates to 15%, which has tipped dozens of small andmedium-sized companies into bankruptcy and weakened consumerdemand. Two other developments are likely to make thingsworse for U.K. manufacturers: increases in oil prices arisingfrom the Middle East crisis and the continued strength of thepound, which is cutting into export orders by making Britishgoods more costly overseas. Economists expect that interestrates will be reduced sometime after the pound becomes a fullparticipant in the European Monetary System, which links theparticipating currencies in set bands of fluctuation. TheU.K. is expected to join the arrangement sometime in the nextfive or six months.</TEXT></DOC>
