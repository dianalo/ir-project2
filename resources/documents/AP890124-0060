Jon D. Glassman, charge d'affaires at the American Embassy, saidthe situation was reaching ``a critical point,'' and he urgedAmericans to get out while commercial air service still is operating.   Only the Soviet airline Aeroflot, using military planes, and theAfghan airline Ariana are still operating out of Kabul's airport.Ariana flights are unpredictable, sometimes delayed or canceleduntil Soviet shipments of aviation fuel arrive.   The warning, in a letter sent to U.S. nationals, followed asimilar warning by the British Embassy last week to Britons andnationals of six other countries for which it has diplomaticresponsibility, including Canada, Australia and Ireland.   ``They've finally gotten through to us,'' said Richard Penner, aCanadian who heads the International Aid Mission, a multinationalcharitable organization of missionaries. He said most of the groupdecided to leave but that he was going to stay.   Penner said the group would be down to 10 by Feb. 11, comparedwith 52 now and 85 during the summer.   Except for the 11 U.S. citizens working at the embassy, most ofthe Americans in Afghanistan belong to the missionary organization.   Other private citizens in Afghanistan include Red Cross workers,officials of U.N. aid agencies, and a dwindling group of Sovietcivilian advisers.   Concern about the situation in Afghanistan has risen as the Feb.15 deadline for the Soviet army's withdrawal approaches.   The Red Army intervened in Afghanistan's civil war in December1979, backing government troops in their fight with Moslemguerrillas. Half their estimated 100,000 soldiers were out of thecountry by Aug. 15, and the remainder are to be out by Feb. 15.   The Soviets announced late last year they had suspended thewithdrawal because of continuing U.S. and Pakistani aid to theguerrillas, and they have not announced a resumption of the pulloutdespite evidence it's in full swing.   Western diplomats said today heavy convoy and air traffic aroundKabul indicates the final Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan isproceeding.   On Monday afternoon, a 70-vehicle military convoy, including sixtanks, armored personnel carriers and troop trucks, moving out fromKabul and headed north toward the Soviet border on the Salanghighway.   In addition, Afghan soldiers have taken over some guard postsaround Kabul from the Soviet troops, and hundreds of Soviet soldiershave been seen boarding transport planes at Kabul's airport.   Western analysts believe the Soviets want to cover up thewithdrawal for both security and political reasons. These includetrying to maintain political leverage to persuade rebel leaders toresume negotiations for a coalition government that would includethe Marxists.   Diplomats in Pakistan reported intense fighting between Communistforces and rebels in northern Kunduz province, and in Nangarhar andKandahar provinces to the east.   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed arebel report Monday of heavy fighting around the provincial capitalof Kunduz, 36 miles south of the Soviet border.   They were unable to confirm rebel claims that guerrillas had shotdown three planes.   Rebel and diplomatic sources also reported battles around theeastern city of Jalababad, capital of Nangarhar province borderingPakistan.</TEXT></DOC>
