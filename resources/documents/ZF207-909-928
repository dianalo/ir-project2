 The study,'Exploiting the Information Revolution: Telecommunications Issuesand Options for Canada,' was written by Hudson Janisch of theUniversity of Toronto and Richard Schultz of McGill University.andO;It stresses that competition is a vital factor in providing anincentive for innovation.andP;  The study contends that users need toplay a greater role in the making of policy, arguing for abeneficial shift away from telecommunications policy determined bytraditional service suppliers.andP;  Four obstacles to such change areidentified as inadequate institutional resources, jurisdictionalconflict, the perception of a threat to universal serviceprovision and acceptance of private ordering.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Royal Bank of Canada (reports).andO;Topic:     TelecommunicationsCommunications TechnologyCommunications Service SuppliersGovernment RegulationStrategic PlanningStudy.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Royal Bank calls for changes to national telecom policyandM;The federal government should act quickly to establish one nationaltelecommunications jurisdiction and to open full and unrestricted competitionwithin it, says a recent report commissioned by Canada's largest privatesector user of telecom services.andM;Exploiting the Information Revolution: Telecommunications Issues and Optionsfor Canada, authored by Hudson Janisch from the University of Toronto'sfaculty of law and Richard Schultz from the department of political scienceat McGill University, was prepared for The Royal Bank of Canada as acontribution to the telecommunications debate.andM;According to Allan Taylor, chairman and chief executive officer at the RoyalBank, telecommunications services is the bank's fastest growing expense.andP;  Andhe is convinced that competition would change that.andM;Less incentiveandM;&quot;Without competition, there is less incentive for innovation,&quot; he said in anaddress held in Toronto last month.andP;  &quot;Users have limited choice in servicesand little, if any, control over what they pay for them.&quot;andM;For example, the bank leases special dedicated lines from the telephonecompanies for data transmission.andP;  One line links Toronto to New York viaBuffalo.andP;  &quot;From Buffalo to new York, a distance of about 500 kilometres, thecost is $8,600 a month,&quot; explained Taylor.andP;  &quot;The Toronto-Buffalo link(one-fifth the distance) costs $17,000 a month.&quot;andM;The central theme of the commissioned study is that users need to play agreater role in telecommunications policy making.andP;  In particular, it callsfor a shift away from telecommunications controlled by traditional serviceproviders and government regulators in favor of control by users.andM;The report argues that Canada has taken only tentative steps towards&quot;liberalization in the provision of telecommunications services and arecognition of the necessity to accommodate the rights of telecommunicationsusers to determine their own choice of services.&quot;andM;It also identifies four obstacles to change that exist in Canada: inadequateinstitutional resources and commitment (the Department of Communications hasconcentrated on cultural and broadcasting issues as opposed totelecommunications); the intergovernmental conflict over jurisdiction; theperception of threat to universality; and, the acceptance of privateordering.andM;For business users, these obstacles have meant taking a backseat to foreigncompetitors.andP;  &quot;Price is only one side of the coin,&quot; noted Taylor.andP;  &quot;The otheris the competitive impact of not having the innovative and more efficientservices.&quot;andM;Some areas in which the bank lags behind are the lack of special high-speeddata lines, limited fibre optics and the fact that it doesn't have the rangeof new 1-800 services available in the U.S.andM;In order for the Canadian business community to remain competitive, Janischand Schultz recommend the following:andM;* The federal government must act on the recent Supreme Court decision toensure that there is a single national policy.andM;* Canadian telecommunications policy should adopt competitive provision oftelecommunications as the norm with regulation of monopoly the exception --the exact reverse of current policies.andM;* A system of explicit targeted subsidies should be introduced not only tosupport continued access by low-income users, but to enable those currentlywithout telephone service to obtain it.andM;* Introduction of competition must be seen as incompatible with traditionalregulation -- the report recommends no restrictions on entry and that currentrestrictions on resale and sharing of facilities, and construction and use ofprivate systems be removed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
