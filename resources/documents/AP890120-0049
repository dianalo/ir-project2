No pickup.</HEAD><DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Iranian spiritual leader called for anend to battles in Lebanon between rival Shiite Moslem militiamenbacked by Iran and Syria, saying the fighting is sinful, Iran'sofficial news agency said today.   The call from the Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, designatedsuccessor to Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, came aspolice said the rival militias skirmished briefly in south Beirut'sslums, wounding three people.   The Syrian-backed Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, orParty of God, clashed with rocket-propelled grenades and machineguns for two hours Thursday night in the Haret Hreik, Bourjel-Barajneh and Hajjaj districts, police said.   The casualties raised the overall toll to 168 killed and 318wounded since Dec. 31, when the two militias began fighting inBeirut and southern Lebanon.   The two factions have been locked in a power struggle for controlof Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the country's largest single sect,since April. More than 500 people have been killed and 1,500 woundedin that period.   Montazeri said the Lebanese clashes ``are clearly haram (sin) andagainst divine Sharia (Islamic law),'' according to Islamic RepublicNews Agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.   Montazeri said it was ``logically and religiously incumbent onany faction and power that believes in Islam and jihad (holy war) inthe path of God to try to put out the flame of this bloodyfighting.''   Most of the casualties since Dec. 31 have been in southernLebanon near Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone,'' a strip ofland north of the border. Israel established the zone in 1985 afterwithdrawing the bulk of its troops from Lebanon following athree-year invasion.</TEXT></DOC>
