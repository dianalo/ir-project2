<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-46-0398 </DOCNO><TEXT>The prototype of a 1 kW-zinc bromide battery constructed in FY 1983 comprisesthe laminated battery stacks in the upper part and two pumps and twotanks for positive and negative electrodes in the lower part and theseapparatuses are connected with piping. Two stacks (approx. 25 V x 10A each) are connected in parallel to obtain a capacity of 1 kW (25 Vx 40 A). The energy efficiency is 80% or more. The battery was scaledup to 10 kW in FY 1984 to 1986 and to 60 kW in FY 1987. The area of electrodein the 60 kW-battery was doubled to 1600 cm. Thirty cells are laminatedin a stack. The voltage is 50 V. The stacks are piled up in two layersof 24 cells each which are connected in parallel to make a submodule.Two submodules connected in series show 50 kW (100 V x 500 A). A halfpart of the battery system was installed in a pit to prevent the electrolytesolution from flowing out of the building. The energy efficiency in dailyoperation reaches 78.2% and the transient response to the stepwise changinginstruction of D.C. power reached approximately 0.6 seconds.
