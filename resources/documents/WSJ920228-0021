In an outcome preceded by much suspense, the House votedlargely along party lines, 221-210, to endorse the Democraticpackage of tax cuts for middle-income taxpayers andbusinesses, combined with tax increases for upper-incomeAmericans. The measure passed on a final vote of 221-209.While the package mirrors the president's own proposals inmany respects, the tax increases are certain veto bait.Senate Democrats also have begun work on a bill that wouldraise taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers.</LP><TEXT>   So, even as the House took a big step toward meeting Mr.Bush's March 20 deadline for action on an economic-stimulusplan, the slim House approval margin indicated Democratscouldn't override a Bush veto even if they wanted to. Theirstrategy is to force the president to choose between signingtheir bill and reneging on his no-new-taxes pledge, orkilling a bill that would cut taxes, though modestly, formost Americans.   President Bush denounced the vote as &quot;a predictable, sad,sorry performance&quot; that merely underscored the &quot;tax-and-spendpolicies&quot; of the Democrats. Speaking at a news conferencefollowing a drug summit with Latin American leaders, hecalled on the Senate to be &quot;a little wiser&quot; than the House.In any case, he pledged that the House bill &quot;won't becomelaw.&quot; Later, he denounced the House action as a &quot;vote againstcreating jobs and stimulating the economy.&quot;   Increasingly, lawmakers from both political parties arelooking beyond the veto, and predicting that at best theywill agree later this year on a much-reduced package. &quot;Myguess is we'll end up with some more modest pro-growthpackage later on this year,&quot; said Rep. Jim Slattery (D.,Kan.).   By summer, Congress and the administration face decisionson extending some popular tax incentives, emergencyunemployment aid and the government's debt limit, all ofwhich could serve as vehicles for broader action on cuttingtaxes.   &quot;This won't die,&quot; said a senior administration official.&quot;There are all sorts of opportunities for things to happenthis year.&quot;   Setting aside the tax increases, the similarities betweenthe Bush and Democratic plans are striking, and suggestfeatures of a possible compromise. Both sides are proposing,among other things, a temporary investment incentive forbusiness, some restoration of deductions on rental losses forthe real-estate industry and reduced taxes on capital gains.   The House Democrats' bill also would provide families taxcredits of as much as $400 in each of the next two years. Atthe same time, it would raise to 35% from 31% the top taxrate for individuals with taxable income of at least $85,000a year and couples with at least $145,000. The bill alsowould impose a 10% surtax on millionaires.   Throughout yesterday's debate, Republicans aimed theirfire at the proposed tax increases. But other parts of thepackage upset some Democrats, too, and made the measure atough sell for party leaders. Liberals complained that themiddle-class tax cut would be too meager. They also said thebusiness tax incentives would be too generous, especially theproposal to index for inflation capital gains on assetsacquired after Feb. 1. Conservative Democrats, meanwhile,groused that the proposed business breaks didn't go farenough, and that the bill would add to the deficit in thenext three years. The higher taxes would begin covering thebill's cost after three years.   But in the end, most Democrats were united by a simplepitch. &quot;The leadership's line is, if we don't pass this therewill be political chaos, and the president will blame theDemocratic Congress,&quot; said Rep. Brian Donnelly (D., Mass.).   The package was opposed by 46 Democrats, while all but oneRepublican, Maine Rep. Olympia Snowe, voted against theDemocrats' plan. The Democratic defectors comprised across-section of the party, from Northern liberals toSouthern and Western conservatives.   The proposed tax increases posed a problem for the usuallyloyal Democrats from New Jersey, where anti-tax sentimentcontinues to boil because of state tax increases underDemocratic Gov. Jim Florio. Undecided to the end, six of thestate's eight Democrats opposed their party's package. Justmoments before the vote, New Jersey Rep. Robert Torricelligave a thumbs-down gesture to the bill's sponsor, House Waysand Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), whoshook his head.   More conservative Democrats might have allied withRepublicans in opposition but for Mr. Bush himself. Severalcited the partisan pugnacity of his January State of theUnion speech, when Mr. Bush set his March 20 deadline. &quot;Thepresident, by picking a fight, made a mistake,&quot; said Rep.Timothy Penny (D., Minn.). &quot;He made this a partisan issue andweakened his own position.&quot;   Before approving the Democrats' plan, the House rejectedthe administration's slimmer package, which incorporatedseven top-priority provisions from Mr. Bush's overall budgetrequest. The proposals included a reduction in thecapital-gains tax to 15.4%, accelerated depreciation thisyear for purchases of business equipment, the real-estatedeductions and a $5,000 credit for first-time home buyers.The president's proposal for a $500-a-child increase in thepersonal exemption wasn't included.   The Democrats' bill included a major tax change that hadadministration support. It would establish a 14-yeardepreciation write-off for purchased &quot;intangible&quot; assets suchas subscriber lists, insurance records, a company'sreputation and other assets known for tax-accounting purposesas &quot;good will.&quot;   To satisfy various business interests, the Democrats madegovernment-granted broadcasting and cable licenses eligiblefor the new tax write-off, and they permitted a shorterwrite-off for most software purchases and movie rights. Inaddition to 14-year depreciation for future purchases, a17-year write-off period was added for intangible assetspurchased in the past. That relief would mean hundreds ofmillions of dollars to some of the country's majorcorporations that have been actively acquiring businesses inrecent years.   Such Democratic-sponsored breaks for business wentunmentioned during the debate, which instead rang withelection-year class partisanship.   Republicans repeatedly accused Democrats of soaking therich, and Democrats charged in turn that Republicans hadwaged warfare on behalf of the wealthy for a decade. Thedeputy GOP leader, Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich, tauntedDemocrats by quoting Paul Tsongas, a presidential candidatewho has accused fellow Democrats of pandering to voters bypromising a middle-class tax cut. House Majority LeaderRichard Gephardt (D., Mo.) countered by quoting Pat Buchanan,Mr. Bush's GOP rival, who has blasted the president forjettisoning his proposed middle-class tax break.   From both sides came occasional suggestions of some futurecompromise. But confrontation will come first. &quot;We are notgoing to stop because the president has an objection,&quot; HouseSpeaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said.   Mr. Gingrich predicted that after vetoing a Democratic taxbill, &quot;The president will go to the country. I think thecountry will, in fact, bring enough pressure to bear, and Ithink enough Democrats will split from their leadership andwe'll pass a tax bill. But I think we have to go through thisdance to get to that point.&quot;   Separately, the House Budget Committee passed a Democraticbudget blueprint that cuts military spending about twice asdeeply as President Bush proposed and puts the savings intodomestic programs and deficit reduction. But the president isexpected to oppose the plan, which will limit its importancein the legislative process.   The $1.5 trillion spending plan for the fiscal year thatbegins Oct. 1 sets military spending at $273.4 billion-$7.6billion in spending authority less than the president soughtand $15 billion less than current projections. Democratswould use most of the savings to boost domestic programs, andthe remainder to cut the budget deficit. As an alternative,the Democrats also suggested a plan that would use all thesavings for deficit reduction. Either way, the deficit isexpected to hover next fiscal year around $330 billion.   The full House is expected to vote on the budget plan nextweek.</TEXT></DOC>
