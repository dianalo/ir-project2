The tax-writers also adopted two new proposals. One,initiated by President Bush, would temporarily sweetenwriteoffs for the purchase of new equipment. The other wouldprovide a separate two-year tax break targeted at smallbusinesses.</LP><TEXT>   The changes were meant to increase support for the taxpackage among Democrats in time for a House vote next week.But they did little to increase the chances for a compromisewith the Bush administration, which is unswerving in itsopposition to the Democrats' plan to increase taxes paid bythe rich.   Meanwhile, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of theSenate Finance Committee, announced that his panel will beginwriting its bill Feb. 27, a day after the expected Housefloor action. Democrats in the Senate are split over whetherto finance any tax cut with tax increases on upper-classtaxpayers or with cuts in the defense budget. The White Houseis prepared to consider the latter course, but not theformer. But with partisan tensions increasing, theadministration isn't inclined toward bipartisan negotiationsright now.   During a caucus yesterday, many rank-and-file HouseDemocrats complained that the earlier draft of the tax billwould permanently cut the top corporate tax rate, whilegiving middle-income Americans only a temporary tax break.Others argued for targeted corporate tax relief, such as atax credit to encourage purchases of new equipment, ratherthan an across-the-board reduction in the corporate tax rateto 33% from 34%.   The alterations in the bill were designed to satisfy bothcomplaints. Democrats plan to caucus on taxes again today.   The House Democrats' plan would rely almost exclusively onhigher income taxes for the top 1% of taxpayers. Thoseproposed tax increases drew no complaints during yesterday'scaucus, according to several lawmakers. The increases didn't,however, escape the administration's notice. &quot;The only thingpermanent in the Democrats' package is a tax increase,&quot; saidTreasury spokeswoman Desiree Tucker-Sorini.   Even as modified, the Democratic package is bound to drawcomplaints from small businesses. Sole proprietorships andpartnerships pay taxes as individuals, and under theDemocrats' plan, the highest-income individuals would be hitwith a new 35% marginal tax rate instead of 31%.   The split between such small businesses and the bigcompanies that would benefit from a corporate rate reductionis reflected within the Tax Reform Action Coaltion, or TRAC,a broad-based business lobby. Its support was instrumental inCongress' overhaul of the tax system in 1986.   TRAC includes industrial powerhouses such as Procter andamp;Gamble Co. and International Business Machines Corp., whichwould clearly benefit from a lowering of the corporate taxrate. But the National Federation of Independent Business, aTRAC member representing hundreds of thousands of tiny firms,told lawmakers that an increase in individual taxes would&quot;result in disaster for Main Street businesses.&quot; Thefederation said that in 1989, 90% of the businesses filingincome tax returns did so as individuals.   In 1986, both individual and corporate rates fell, makingall of TRAC's members happy. But this time, &quot;there's aquandary the group has never had to address before,&quot; saidLarry O'Brien, a Washington lawyer who serves as counsel toTRAC. &quot;We're well short of a collective conclusion about whatdirection, if any, we can move in.&quot;   The 100 members of TRAC's policy-setting committee are setto meet today to see if they can reach some kind ofconsensus. Yesterday, the influential National Association ofWholesale-Distributors said it decided to oppose theDemocrats' plan because its own ranks are riven: Some memberspay taxes as corporations and others pay as individuals. &quot;Wecannot have a house divided,&quot; said Alan Kranowitz, seniorvice president for the wholesalers.   At their caucus yesterday, Democrats took turnscriticizing the proposed permanet cut in corporate rates,saying it would be too broad and too costly; its cost isestimated at $17.1 billion over six years. Rep. David Obey(D., Wis.) said the permanent cut would be &quot;a very expensiveproposition for minimal economic impact.&quot; By limiting thecorporate tax cut to two years, the five-year cost would bereduced by $10 billion.   Some of that savings would go to pay for Mr. Bush'sproposal to give business an extra 15% depreciation allowancefor equipment purchased this year. In addition, a provisiondesigned to help small businesses would allow firms to writeoff as much as $25,000 of equipment in the year of purchase,compared with $10,000 currently.   Some liberal Democrats criticized the Democrats' planbecause it includes a tax break on capital gains; they citedthe party's oft-made arguments that such a proposaloverwhelmingly would favor rich investors. A fewconservatives groused that the package would add to the hugedeficit in the first three years -- a point theadministration made as well. The losses would be offset inlater years as the temporary tax cuts expire.   But even some of the critics said they would support thepackage, and party leaders expressed confidence that it wouldhave enough Democratic support to pass. Still, in order toavoid taking any chances, especially since few Republicanswill vote for the plan, they directed the Ways and MeansDemocrats to make the modifications.   ---   Jeffrey H.
