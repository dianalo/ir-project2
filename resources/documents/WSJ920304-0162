The legislation, which amended the Securities Exchange Actof 1934, applied to shareholder litigation that was alreadyunder way when the U.S. Supreme Court imposed a nationwide,three-year statute of limitations on securities cases lastJune.                                                                                                          If the ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Charles A.Legge in San Francisco is adopted in other jurisdictions, itcould endanger lawsuits that seek hundreds of millions ofdollars in damages from securities companies and accountingfirms.   As a result of the congressional amendment, some $652million in lawsuits that were jeopardized or dismissedbecause of the high court's decision have been reinstated,according to a spokesman for the House Telecommunications andFinance Subcommittee.   Judge Legge said that the legislation, passed by Congressand signed by President Bush late last year, improperlyexempted the pending lawsuits from the new time constraints.The high court's controversial decision specifically appliedthe federal limits retroactively to cover pending cases.   Judge Legge said the legislation that followed violatedthe &quot;separation of powers&quot; doctrine, which delineates therole of the three federal branches of government. He didn'telaborate, saying that he intends to issue a written opinion,but he appeared to accept defendants' arguments that Congresscouldn't act to determine the validity of specific lawsuits.   In a letter submitted to the San Francisco court prior toargument in the case, lawyers for the defendants wrote: &quot;Anyattempt by Congress to interfere . . . with the SupremeCourt's determination with respect to the retroactive scopeand meaning of the Court's decisions intrudes&quot; on thejudicial function.   &quot;This legislation represented an effort by Congress tointerfere with the judicial process,&quot; said Lawrence Keeshan,a partner at the San Francisco office of the law firm ofGibson, Dunn andamp; Crutcher, which represented the defendantaccounting firm Price Waterhouse. &quot;It's one thing forCongress to change the law, it's another thing for Congressto tell courts how they are to apply their rules ofdecision,&quot; Mr. Keeshan said.   The case was brought by a group of investors who claimedthey were defrauded in the purchase of certain real estatelimited partnerships. In defending itself, Price Waterhouse,which audited certain financial statements that appeared inthe partnerships' prospectuses, said that all of its work wasaccurate and that the suits should be barred by the statuteof limitations. Other defendants, who included promoters ofthe partnerships, presented similar arguments.   Shareholder lawyers played down the importance of JudgeLegge's ruling, citing a handful of recent federal courtcases that applied the amendment.   &quot;This opinion so far is a distinctly unique and minorityview,&quot; said Fred Isquith, a New York plaintiffs' securitieslawyer. &quot;With all due respect to the court, I think theCongress knows what it's doing and did the right thing. Itsolved a national problem legislatively, through thedemocratic process, which is what they should have done.&quot;   Before the Supreme Court issued its 5-4 ruling, federalcourts looked to widely varying state securities-fraud lawsin order to rule on issues of timeliness. But the highcourt's imposition of a single, strict constraint promptedcriticism from Securities and Exchange Commission ChairmanRichard Breeden and many members of Congress, who contendedthat investors wouldn't have enough time to bring fraudcases.   Craig C. Corbitt, a San Francisco lawyer for theplaintiffs, said that his clients, investors in defunctBrichard Securities Co., planned to appeal.   The statute of limitations has been an important issue inmany of the most highly-publicized business cases of recenttimes. While these cases are affected by the San Franciscodecision, ultimate rulings on the issue could affect suchcases as a securities-fraud lawsuit by bondholders of CharlesH. Keating Jr.'s former American Continental Corp., whocontend they were defrauded of some $300 million to $400million.

A federal court jury ruled that Heinold Commodities Inc.,Chicago, wasn't responsible for losses of more than $9million in the account it held for the failed CommonwealthSavings andamp; Loan Association of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.   The verdict came late Monday in the first trial of a suitbrought against professional advisers to a thrift by theResolution Trust Corp., according to an RTC spokeswoman inWashington, D.C. The RTC, created in August 1989 to helprecoup losses at failed thrifts, is pressing scores of suitsagainst lawyers, accountants and other professional advisersto failed thrifts.   In this case, &quot;the RTC was trying unfairly to shift blamefor the actions and failings of the institution to theoutside professionals,&quot; said Heinold's lawyer, William J.Nissen of Sidley andamp; Austin, Chicago. Heinold's parent company,Gelderman Inc., is a unit of ConAgra Inc.   After a three-week trial, the jury found thatCommonwealth's treasurer, not the broker, directed the tradesin treasury bond futures and options that led to the lossesfor the thrift. The jury didn't accept the argument that thebroker shouldn't have accepted the trades. The RTCspokeswoman said the agency will decide whether to appealafter reviewing the verdict.   Commonwealth was taken over by regulators in July 1989,and suits are pending against its former officers andaccounting firm in federal court in Florida, the RTCspokeswoman said.   ---   PUBLIC HOUSING eviction project aimed at drug users haslegal setback.   A three-judge panel of the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals in Richmond, Va., ruled against a drug-enforcementproject designed by Housing and Urban Development SecretaryJack Kemp. The judges said it violated the due process clauseof the U.S. Constitution because it provided for the evictionof public housing tenants without allowing them to defendthemselves in a hearing.   The decision upheld a ruling by a lower court judge whobarred the federal government from conducting raids onapartments that house suspected drug dealers in 23 cities.   As envisioned by Mr. Kemp three years ago, the NationalPublic Housing Asset Forfeiture Project would allow housingauthorities to evict lease holders after any tenant oroccupant was arrested for using or selling drugs in theirapartment. Even if the lease holder didn't know the occupantwas a drug user or dealer, the lease holder could lose theapartment without having an opportunity to present a defensebefore a judge or hearing officer.   The federal government argued that the customary evictionprocess took too long and needed to be streamlined to dealwith the illegal drug crisis plaguing public housingprojects. It also asserted that the high level of drugactivity created an emergency that justified the extrememeasure. In his opinion, Judge Alexander Harvey II said the&quot;mere use or possession of narcotics would not in every caseconstitute an extraordinary situation.&quot;   Mary Brunette, a HUD spokeswoman, said, &quot;It's too early tosay whether the case will be appealed.&quot;   ---   HOMELESS MAN SETTLES with insurer in suit against library.   Richard R. Kreimer, 42 years old, who last Novembersettled a police harassment suit against Morristown, N.J.,for $150,000, settled a related suit against the town'spublic library, which had evicted him several times.   But the settlement is only with the library's insurer,Travelers Insurance Co. of Hartford, a unit of TravelersCorp., and covers only compensatory damages. Lawyers for Mr.Kreimer said they plan to push for punitive damages on theground that Mr. Kreimer suffered emotional distress over thelibrary's treatment.   ---   Christi Harlan in Dallas contributed to this article.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
