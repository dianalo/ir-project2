<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-02-0428 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method is described for the spectrophotometric determination of uranium(VI)and plutonium(IV) in nitric acid solutions. Uranium is determined asa light-absorbing complex with arsenazo III in 0.05 M nitric acid at{lambda}= 654 nm, plutonium as a light-absorbing complex with xylenolorange in 0.1 M nitric acid at {lambda}= 540 nm. For the determinationof uranium, DTPA is introduced into the photometric solution to maskthe plutonium together with the tetravalent, and some trivalent, elements.The relative mean-square deviation of the results does not exceed 0.03in the concentration ranges 0.5-5 {mu}g U/ml, 1-3 {mu}g Pu/ml.</TEXT></DOC>
