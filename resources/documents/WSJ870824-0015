The price hadn't been disclosed previously.    A spokesman for Ralston said the sale would result in a fourth-quarter pretax gain of about $61 million. In the 1986 fourth quarter, the maker of pet foods earned $90.6 million, or $1.18 a share, on sales of $1.6 billion.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquire a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Ralston shares closed at $90.625, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
