(comparison of Microsoft Corp.'s OS/2 and Windows 3.0)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Winship, Sally.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>The differences in memory management between Microsoft Corp's OS/2operating system and Windows 3.0 graphical user interface areimportant to applications programmers and systems managers but maybe irrelevant to end users.andP;  OS/2 is generally considered betterat cleaning up unused, fragmented memory while Windows does notperform defragmentation automatically.andP;  This can create a problemfor Windows users when applications are running busily and thereis not time to perform the clean up but the unified space isneeded.andP;  Some users think OS/2 is more powerful overall and hasthe advantage of not running on top of another system.andP;  Windows3.0 runs on top of MS-DOS, but also has more applications that canrun under it than does OS/2.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   OS/2 (Operating system) (Design and construction)Microsoft Windows 3.0 (Graphical user interface) (Design andconstruction).andO;Topic:     ComparisonMultitaskingOperating EnvironmentsOperating SystemsGraphical User InterfaceMemory Management.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Sally WinshipandM;Although OS/2 and Microsoft Windows 3.0 have different methods of allocatingmemory to applications, for most of the applications being run today, thesedifferences are almost a moot point, according to buyers.andM;&quot;There are some differences between the two,&quot; said Michael Claus, manager ofsoftware engineering for Technicon Instruments Corp., a manufacturer ofmedical diagnostics instruments in Tarrytown, N.Y.andP;  &quot;OS/2 keeps track offragmented memory and deals with cleaning it up better than Windows.&quot; Butaside from cleaning up unused memory, the differences in memory managementbetween the two systems do not affect Claus' work.andP;  &quot;I don't think ourapplications are demanding enough for it to be a problem in either case,&quot; hesaid.andM;Claus was using Windows but has ported to OS/2 because of the flat memoryspace promised in version 2.0.andP;  At Technicon Instruments, Claus is developinga medically related results processor that acts as a front end andcommunicates with analytical instruments through a serial port.andM;&quot;The user has to do the defragmentation of memory in Windows,&quot; Claus said.andO;&quot;If you deallocate memory, [Windows] leaves chunks of memory around, and theuser is responsible for doing the garbage collecting.andM;&quot;This tends to cause problems,&quot; he added, &quot;because the times when myapplication is busiest and doesn't have the time to do garbage collecting arethe times when I most need to do it.&quot;andM;According to Peter Dillon, a programmer for the State of ConnecticutDepartment of Environmental Protection in Hartford, both operatingenvironments handle memory internally without involving the user.andM;From the point of view of the user, he said, &quot;memory management is the samein both systems.andP;  When you set the program up, [the machine] looks to see ifyou have extended or expanded memory, and you don't have a lot of controlafter that point.&quot;andM;However, Dillon said he believes OS/2 is a more advanced system for handlingmemory.andP;  &quot;OS/2 is a lot quicker and more designed to handle memorymanagement,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Part of [memory management] is being able to sharememory with multiple programs, and OS/2 handles that better than Windows 3.0.andO;When using Windows, you are building on top of DOS, but OS/2 is a wholeoperating system made for running a graphical-user-interface type ofprogram.&quot;andM;Dillon uses both Windows 3.0 and OS/2 for the internal development ofinventory programs and software for tracking federal and state grants.andP;  Thereare a lot of programs we want to run under OS/2 that are not available yet,&quot;he said.andP;  &quot;Right now, our programming environment of choice will be Windowsuntil we can get more [applications] running in OS/2.&quot;andM;Other users of both Windows 3.0 and OS/2 have noted that OS/2 is the morepowerful system, but have not seen noticeable differences in memorymanagement.andM;&quot;OS/2 is the way to go, from a programming point of view,&quot; said GeorgeStromberg, manager of the information center at Textron Defense Systems Inc.,andO;a defense company in Wilmington, Mass.andP;  &quot;However, the memory management ispretty close in both environments.&quot;andM;Stromberg uses OS/2 for compiling a COBOL program.andP;  He said many programmingtools needed for this project were available only in OS/2.andP;  In his day-to-dayapplications, he uses Windows 3.0 for its memory-management capabilities.andM;&quot;I can have a spreadsheet, word processor, our company phone book and mailsystem up all day and switch between them,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;And as [softwaredevelopers] migrate to Windows, there will be further benefit there.andO;Windows' memory management works fine for what I'm doing.andP;  I would hope OS/2would look better because it is a more powerful system, but I don't need morethan Windows right now.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
