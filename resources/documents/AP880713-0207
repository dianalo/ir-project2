The United States welcomed calls for the International CivilAviation Organization to investigate the July 3 tragedy over thePersian Gulf. However, it said ``fair-minded'' countries shouldconclude that the captain of the U.S. warship Vincennes actedreasonably under the circumstances.   U.S. officials said the missile cruiser Vincennes mistook IranAir Flight 655 for an Iranian F-14 jet fighter during combat withfour Iranian gunboats.   The 159-member aviation organization is a United Nations agency.Most of its 33-nation council, meeting in special session, favoredan investigation but refrained from condemning the United States.The council was expected to reconvene Thursday.   Soviet delegate Ivan Vasin repeated his country's condemnationof the disaster, calling it ``a grievous international offense forwhich the United States bears full responsibility.''   The Czechoslovakian delegate said: ``My government stronglycondemns this tragic and unjustified act.''   Many speakers urged ratification of a 1984 organization protocolstating that weapons should never, under any circumstances, be usedagainst civilian aircraft. So far, 48 members have ratified it. Totake effect, it needs approval from 102 members.   West Germany and other nations urged the body to reviewprovisions for coordinating military and civilian air traffic,especially in war zones.   After a minute of silence for the victims, the council heardfirst from Iranian spokesman Hassan Shafty, who accused the UnitedStates of evading responsibility by claiming it acted inself-defense.   ``The use of force against civil aircraft cannot be justifiedunder any circumstances and is a flagrant violation ofinternational law,'' Shafty said.   The plane was ascending after taking off from Bandar Abbas,Iran, on a 28-minute flight to Dubai and was transmitting normalcivilian airline signals, he said. His statement contradicted U.S.claims that the plane was descending and sending both military andcivilian signals.   Shafty accused the United States of hypocrisy since in pastcases it has categorically rejected the self-defense argument. Hiscomment was an apparent reference to the Soviet explanation forshooting down a Korean Air Lines jet that strayed over Sovietterritory in 1983.   In addition to an inquiry, Iran demanded that the aviationorganization call for an end to ``present obstacles, restrictions,threats and use of force'' in Iranian air space and that of otherstates bordering the Persian Gulf. It also urged condemnation ofthe United States and recognition that it bears responsibility for``the criminal actions'' of its officials.   Outside the meeting chamber, Iranian official Seirous Naseriacknowledged that Iran might fail to win a condemnation.   But he said the U.N. Security Council, which was scheduled todiscuss the matter Thursday, may issue sterner language. ``That'swhere politics comes into the scene,'' Naseri said.   Iran belongs to the aviation body but not its council.   Earlier, U.S. permanent representative Edmund Stohr told TheAssociated Press that Iran would never get a condemnation becausethe United States had many allies on the council.   The U.S. delegation was led by Richard Williamson, assistantsecretary of state for International Organization Affairs.   He said the payments that President Reagan has offered thevictims' families were voluntary, ``not on the basis of any legalliability or obligation.''   Williamson also said the United States would share with aviationbody the results of its own investigation, except for sensitivemilitary information.   He blamed the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq for creatingthe circumstances that led to the disaster.   ``Some degree of responsibility must be taken by Iran forputting its aircraft in this vulnerable position. The innocentvictims of Iran Air 655 are just the latest among the hundreds ofthousands of casualties in a needless war which should have endedlong ago.''   He said the war has jeopardized the safety of naval and airtraffic in the gulf, and U.S. forces are deployed to contain thethreat.   Williamson suggested restructuring civil air routes away fromdangerous areas and imposing new minimum altitudes. He alsorecommended changes to aircraft transponders so that signals areunambiguous and better radio communications to ensure all warningsare received.</TEXT></DOC>
