No pickup.</HEAD><DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Parliament and state-run mediatoday criticized a resolution passed by the Polish parliamentcondemning the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.   The government said Thursday it will come down hard on anyprotests Monday marking the 21st anniversary of the invasion thatcrushed the brief reform period known as ``Prague Spring.''   In its reaction to the Polish parliament's vote Thursday, thepresidium of the Czechoslovak parliament said it ``is taken aback bythese declarations which ... are a gross interference in internalaffairs of Czechoslovakia and categorically rejects them.''   The resolution adopted by the Polish Sejm, the lower house of theNational Assembly, said the Soviet-led invasion ``violated everynation's inalienable right to self-determination and its naturaldesire for democracy, freedom and respect of human rights.''   On Tuesday, Hungary's Communist Party said its ``presentleadership ... does not concur with the 1968 military interventionin Czechoslovakia'' but that assessing the event ``should be theright and task of the Czechoslovak people and the CzechoslovakCommunist Party.''   The 1968 invasion crushed a short-lived liberalization periodspearheaded by then Communist Party leader Alexander Dubcek, who wasousted in April 1969.   Communist East Germany, meanwhile, strongly defended the invasion.   New Germany, the East German Communist Party daily newspaper,claimed that the United States and West Germany led ``imperialistforces'' trying to influence Czechoslovak affairs in the days beforethe Warsaw Pact invasion.   The newspaper commentary reiterated the hard line East Germanyhas adhered to while allied Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Unionhave introduced economic and social reforms and begun a reassessmentof their pasts.   East Germany has resisted the reforms advocated by Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev, and it has given little attention in thestate-run media to the democratic advances sweeping Poland andHungary.</TEXT></DOC>
