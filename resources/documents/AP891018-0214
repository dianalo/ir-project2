Amendments formally ending one-party domination in Hungary,regulating free elections by next summer and creating the office ofstate president won overwhelming approval at the nationallytelevised session of Parliament.   The country was renamed the Republic of Hungary. Like otherSoviet bloc nations, it had been known as a ``people's republic''since 1949.   But the chamber stalled on one key move toward democracy,postponing a decision on opposition calls for a referendum on whento elect the head of state. Government leaders want the electionnext month, but opposition leaders say it's too soon.   Nonetheless, speaker of Parliament Matyas Szueros, who takesover as acting president until a new head of state is elected,proclaimed Wednesday a historic day for Hungary.   ``A parliamentary democracy and a legal state is being built inHungary on the ruins of a dictatorship of sorts,'' Szuerosreportedly told the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.   The voting followed dissolution of the communist party and itsreplacement by the Hungarian Socialist Party, which vows commitmentto a democratic system while continuing for the moment to dominatenational politics.   The State Department said Wednesday in a statement inWashington: ``Today the Hungarian Parliament voted overwhelminglyin favor of an amended constitution which leaves only about 10percent of the 1949 Stalinist document in place. The amendedconstitution contains democratic principles and many of theelements of our own Bill of Rights. The constitution provides thatHungary will be declared a `republic.' not a `people's republic.'The word `people's' was a legacy from the Stalin era.''   Parliament also began discussion of a law that will regulate theoperation and finances of political parties in the first multipartyelections since 1947.   Among the 94 modifications were amendments eliminating allreferences to the leading role of the dissolved communist party.   ``Political partiess may be freely established and may freelyfunction,'' the amendment declared.   An entirely new constitution is to be drawn up and adopted bythe new Parliament after the national elections, but JusticeMinister Kalman Kulcsar has said the amendments were necessary tomake next year's elections legal.   The new post of president of the republic replaces the 21-mancollective presidency that had broad powers, including acting forParliament when it was not sitting, as well as overrulingparliamentary decisions.   Once the amendments take effect this month, the presidentialcouncil will be dissolved and Szueros will assume its powers untila president is elected.   The new president will be the commander-in-chief of the armedforces, is authorized to call national and regional elections andmay initiate a referendum.   The president may also dissolve Parliament if it fails toapprove a new government or votes for no-confidence in thegovernment four times in one year.   The new president may be stripped of his office if he knowinglyviolates the constitution or other laws and may not be a leader ofany political party.   Before the key votes, Premier Miklos Nemeth called an emergencyCabinet meeting to discuss an opposition petition to postpone theelection to the new state presidency, tentatively scheduled forNov. 26, until after next year's parliamentary elections.   Some opposition parties assert they have no time or resources toorganize against Socialist Party candidate Imre Pozsgay.   The premier and all but one of his ministers were rankingmembers of the communist party, and most remain in the top levelsof the new socialist party. However, the ministries of theinterior, finance and trade and commerce now are formallydepoliticized.</TEXT></DOC>
