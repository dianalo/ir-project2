The Vietnamese-installed government said it would carry on thefight against a three-party guerrilla coalition.   ``Our friends go, but the special Cambodian-Vietnameserelationship does not,'' said a red banner in front of dozens ofmilitary vehicles that rumbled out of this northwestern province tothe blare of a pop music band in a government-organized ceremony.   The only observers of the fanfare were foreign journalists andofficial delegations from Vietnam's socialist allies _ Laos, Cubaand the Soviet Union, the main source of arms for the war.   As the withdrawal began, Phnom Penh's Prime Minister Hun Senreturned home from Thailand without a cease-fire agreement. TheThais had tried to patch a truce together after a failedinternational peace conference.   Hun Sen called on countries to honor pledges to halt aid to theguerrillas after the Vietnamese pullout.   Vietnamese officials said 26,000 troops from Siem Reap and otherareas will cross the border into southern Vietnam by Tuesday, endingHanoi's involvement in the war that erupted after it invaded to oustits former Communist comrade, the Khmer Rouge.   Leaders of the Khmer Rouge and two non-communist guerrillaorganizations in the resistance coalition say the withdrawal is aploy and charge Vietnam is hiding troops in Cambodia. The coalitioncommands 50,000 fighters.   China shared that skepticism Thursday. ``It (Hanoi) is stillemploying tricks on the question of troop withdrawal and placing avariety of obstacles in the way of a comprehensive settlement of theCambodian question,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing toldreporters.   Some observers have called Hanoi's intervention ``Vietnam'sVietnam'' _ likening its withdrawal from a costly, agonizing waragainst forces it could not eradicate to the United States' war inVietnam.   Hanoi says 55,300 Vietnamese died fighting the Cambodians, halfof them in 1977 and 1978 before their Christmas invasion. Vietnam'simpoverished population of 65 million also suffered from economicblockades mounted by non-Communist countries outraged by theinvasion.   It ended the rule of Pol Pot, who led Khmer Rouge efforts toforce an agrarian revolution in Cambodia. Hundreds of thousands ofcivilians were slain.   ``The West should stop supporting the Khmer Rouge and stop beingfooled by Khmer Rouge propaganda,'' senior Foreign Ministry officialUch Kiman said at the farewell ceremony.   He said his Vietnamese-backed government is prepared to continuefighting, but added he does not believe his country ever would askthe Vietnamese to return.   Phnom Penh rejects U.S.-backed demands from the non-Communistguerrillas who say they rather would have a transitional governmentincluding the Khmer Rouge, the most powerful resistance faction,than continue fighting it.   Maj. Gen. Huol Savorn, regional commander of Cambodian forces,said his troops have taken over the fighting from the Vietnamesethis year in the hotly contested provinces bordering Thailand.   After the pullout, the guerrillas will launch a major offensiveto try to occupy border areas before striking further into Cambodia,he told reporters.   Fighting already has intensified. Cambodian refugees at a U.N.camp on the Thai border Thursday threatened a strike and demanded tobe moved to a safer place after four to eight artillery shellsexploded close by their camp overnight, a U.N. refugee worker said.   Across the border, departing Vietnamese troops carried riflesalong with flowers and miniature flags thrown by thousands ofCambodians.   The Cambodians, many looking glum and uninterested, stood outsidea kindergarten school built by Vietnamese troops of the departingFront 479, and waved flags and placards praising and thanking them.   Organized by authorities into groups were students, soldiers, andhundreds of children in red kerchiefs _ ``young pioneers'' of theCommunist Party.   On a makeshift wooden stage, military officers made speechesdenouncing ``Pol Pot genocide,'' and four elderly Buddhist monks insaffron robes prayed for peace.   Maj. Gen. Khieu Anh Lon, commander of Front 479, hugged aCambodian officer and received a kerchief from a young pioneer and abouquet of flowers.   The general waved the flowers as he climbed into hisweather-beaten U.S.-made jeep to begin the long journey southeast.   Departing soldiers carried back guitars, photos of Vietnameseactresses clipped from newspapers, even dogs and a monkey.   Some had served in Cambodia since 1979 and said they were glad toreturn home to their families.   ``Pol Pot soldiers are weak and we are strong,'' said Maj. ChuViet Duong, 32, who in eight years fought many battles against themand had five medals on his chest to prove it. Unlike many Vietnamesesoldiers, he said he was never hungry and had malaria only once.</TEXT></DOC>
