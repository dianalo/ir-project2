In order to investigate thefibrogenic and carcinogenic potential of any fiber sample in normal situations,inhalation studies are necessary. This report describes long-term inhalationand injection studies sponsored by the Institute for Research and Developmenton Asbestos. In these experiments, rats were exposed to either the short-fiberchrysotile preparation or to a dust cloud generated from the same batchof raw chrysotile in such a way as to produce the highest possible proportionof long fibers.</TEXT></DOC>
