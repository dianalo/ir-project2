Beginning Sept. 1, doctors and suppliers of medicalequipment will be required to file all Medicare insuranceclaims for their patients at no charge. And on Jan. 1,Medicare will impose new limits on doctors' fees, a changedesigned to protect patients from excessive charges.</LP><TEXT>   The American Medical Association opposes both measures asburdensome to doctors. &quot;Physicians spend more time respondingto rules, regulations and paper work than I sometimes thinkthey spend caring for patients,&quot; complains James Todd, theexecutive director of the AMA.   But there's little chance the AMA will succeed in itsefforts to derail the changes. The provisions are part of aphysician payment reform plan that Congress passed last yearwith the hope of slowing the double-digit growth of doctors'bills paid by Medicare, the federal health insurance programfor 33 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries. Under thelaw, a new, nationwide payment formula will be phased inbetween 1992 and 1996.   Although the law applies mainly to doctors, severalprovisions are designed to reduce burdens on Medicarebeneficiaries. In addition, the Health Care FinancingAdministration, which runs the $100 billion Medicare program,is studying other improvements for beneficiaries. Oneanticipated change is a new version of the so-calledExplanation of Medicare Benefits form.   Several hundred million of these forms are sent out eachyear, making it one of the most common communications betweenthe government and the public. Yet many senior citizenscomplain that the benefit notices are confusing,uninformative and difficult to read. Congress's GeneralAccounting Office recently rapped the HCFA for not making theforms easier to understand.   The Sept. 1 change will relieve beneficiaries of filingMedicare claims. Officials at the HCFA and the AMA estimatethat doctors already file between 90% and 95% of the morethan 400 million claims submitted each year under MedicarePart B, which covers services from doctors. Nevertheless, theAMA has asked Congress to repeal the physician-filingrequirement, complaining that it &quot;will add increasedadministrative costs to the physician practice.&quot;   But the measure has strong support from senior citizengroups. The American Association of Retired Persons hasorganized 3,200 volunteers in 37 states to help people dealwith Medicare; 14% of the people served need help filingMedicare claims. &quot;One of our big problems is helping peoplefile their initial claims with Medicare,&quot; says Bob Jackson,who runs the assistance program.   Some elderly patients find Medicare so complex that theydon't bother to file claims. The Physician Payment ReviewCommission, a federal agency, estimates that about onemillion people a year don't seek reimbursement because filing&quot;is too complicated or too time-consuming.&quot; Physician-filingwill increase benefits to such people by about $100 millionannually, the agency calculates.   In addition, the AARP reports that many seniors complainthat doctors levy charges for filing Medicare forms. Suchfiling fees, which range up to $10 a claim, will be banned asof Oct. 1.   One reason Congress imposed the new requirement was toimprove efficiency by reducing the number of errors inMedicare filings, which are processed for HCFA by 34insurance companies. The GAO estimates that last year 45million claims -- 11% of all those filed -- lackedinformation needed to process them. Most of these claims werefiled by physicians and other providers, rather than by thebeneficiaries themselves. The HCFA is currently working withinsurance companies to improve error-reduction programs, anarea in which the GAO said the agency has been deficient.   The other major change will place uniform new limits onwhat physicians can charge Medicare patients, starting Jan.1. When doctors deal with Medicare patients, they can choosebetween two basic billing procedures. They can accept thepatient &quot;on assignment,&quot; which means that they will chargethe patient only what Medicare allows for the procedure, sendtheir bill to the insurance company that handles Medicareclaims in their area and receive reimbursement. About 80% ofMedicare's claims are submitted on assignment.   Doctors using the second method, called balance billing,charge more than the Medicare reimbursement rate, meaningthat the patient must pay the difference between whatMedicare pays and the higher amount the doctor charges. (Inboth cases, Medicare pays 80% of approved doctors' bills,requiring the patient to pay a 20% co-payment; many seniorshave private supplemental insurance, called Medigap, thatpays the co-payment.)   Last year, balance billing charges paid by patients andinsurers totaled $2.2 billion.   Starting Jan. 1, the maximum doctors can charge underbalance billing will be 125% of the Medicare reimbursementrate. That cap will fall to 115% by 1993. The new limits willreplace a complex system that HCFA officials admit almostnobody understands.   The AMA opposes the limits. &quot;We don't believe thatphysicians should be subject to arbitrary billing limits,&quot;the organization told Congress last month. &quot;The 1991 balancebilling cap could cause serious reductions in the feesphysicians would otherwise be allowed to charge,&quot;particularly in rural areas.   But senior citizens groups strongly support the new caps,which will reduce balance billing payments for some patients.In addition, the change will make it easier for patients toprotect themselves from excessive charges. The combination ofthe evolving nationwide fee schedule and the cap will enableinsurance companies to tell patients subject to balancebilling the maximum their doctors can charge. Thisinformation isn't currently included on the Explanation ofMedicare Benefits form because each doctor has a differentmaximum for each procedure.   The National Committee to Preserve Social Security andMedicare, which represents senior citizens, has asked theHCFA to include the maximum allowed charges on benefit forms,along with a note that beneficiaries subject to balancebilling don't have to pay any more.   It has also urged the HCFA to take other steps &quot;to helpdemystify Medicare reimbursements.&quot; One proposal is that theHCFA adopt a standard nationwide form. Currently, theinsurance companies that process Medicare claims issuedifferent forms, and seniors who travel sometimes find itdifficult to match them up.   In its report, the GAO called the current forms confusingbecause they don't clearly describe benefit decisions or themedical services for which reimbursement is being made.Beneficiaries made about 19 million inquiries to theircarriers last year, in part because of &quot;confusion about theinformation presented on the notices,&quot; the GAO said.   The HCFA is launching an effort to redesign the benefitform for use starting Jan. 1, 1992. &quot;I would think if theyreally chose, they could get it out sooner,&quot; says MarthaMcSteen, president of the National Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
