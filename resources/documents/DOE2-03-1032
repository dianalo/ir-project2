On subsequent days there was shorteningof the T/sub 1/ and T/sub 2/ times. Gadolinium DTPA produced a markedeffect in the second to fourth day following the trauma, if the examinationwas carried out 90 to 120 minutes after the administration of contrastmedium. Gadolinium can be used in determining the age and clarifyingthe differential diagnosis of an bleeding if there is clinical support.</TEXT></DOC>
