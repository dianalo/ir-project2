Warshaw, AssociateDirector for Industry and Standards, National Institute of Standards andTechnology, telephone number (301) 975-4000, FAX (301) 926-0647.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> Section 4(a) of the Federal EnergyManagement Improvement Act of 1988 provides that ``it shall be unlawfulfor any person to manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, orreceive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm unless such firearm contains,or has affixed to it, a marking approved by the Secretary of Commerce ** *.'' (15 U.S.C. 5001(a).)  Section 4(b)(1) of the Act establishes asan initial acceptable marking a permanently affixed, blaze orange pluginserted in the barrel of the toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm, recessedno more than 6 millimeters from the muzzle end of the barrel, and madean integral part of the device. (15 U.S.C. 5001(b)(1).) Section 4(b)(2)authorizes the Secretary to approve an alternative marking for any toy,look-alike, or imitation firearm not capable of being marked with the requisiteblaze orange plug, and to waive the marking requirements for any toy, look-alike,or imitation firearm that will only be used in the theatrical, movie ortelevision industries. (15 U.S.C. 5001(b)(2).) Section 4(b)(3) authorizesthe Secretary to adjust or change the marking system established pursuantto sections 4(b) (1) and (2), after consultation with interested persons.(15 U.S.C. 5001(b)(3).) The Technology Administration held a public workshop at the National Instituteof Standards and Technology on February 9, 1989, on the marking requirementsof the Act. (See 53 FR 50987, Dec. 19, 1988.) The workshop was attendedby forty representatives of trade associations, manufacturers, importers,distributors and Federal Agencies. Many attendees brought samples of toy,look-alike or imitation firearms. Although not requested, written commentswere received in advance and subsequent to the workshop. Based on the comments received and consultations at the workshop and elsewherewith trade associations, manufacturers, importers, distributors, collectors,retailers, police chiefs, and Federal Agencies, the Under Secretary forTechnology published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 14, 1989 (54 FR 10550). The notice proposedto maintain the blaze orange plug marking established by section 4(b)(1)of the Act and establish as an alternative marking system for water guns,air-soft guns, light emitting guns or other ejecting toy, look-alike orimitation firearms which, as such, cannot be marked with a plug in themuzzle end of the barrel because it would restrict the opening necessaryto discharge such things as water, non-metallic projectiles, and light,a blaze orange marking permanently affixed to the exterior surface of thebarrel and covering the circumference of the barrel and extending fromthe muzzle end for a depth of at least 6 millimeters. The notice also proposedto adjust the statutory marking system by permitting three other methodsof marking for use in the alternative irrespective of whether the devicecould be marked with the blaze orange plug or blaze orange muzzle marking.The three alternatives proposed were to mark the device at manufactureby: (1) Constructing it entirely of transparent or translucent materials whichpermit unmistakable observation of the device's complete contents; (2)permanently coloring the entire exterior surface of the device bright red,bright orange, bright yellow, bright green, or bright blue, either singlyor as the predominant color in combination with other colors in any pattern;or (3) permanently coloring the entire exterior surface of the device predominantlyin white in combination with one or more of the colors bright red, brightorange, bright yellow, bright green, or bright blue in any pattern. Thesealternatives were selected because they represent standard industry practicefor most toy, look-alike and imitation firearms and, in the opinion ofthose consulted, are sufficient to identify the device as a toy, look-alike,or imitation firearm rather than as a real firearm. Finally, the noticeproposed to waive marking requirements for any toy, look-alike or imitationfirearm that will only be used in the theatrical, movie or television industries.Section 4(c) of the Act specifically excludes from the Act's marking requirementsor any marking requirements established thereunder look-alike, non-firing,collector replicas of antique firearms designed, manufactured, and producedprior to 1898, and traditional B-B, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air gunsthat expel a projectile through the force of air pressure. (15 U.S.C 5001(c).)However, it is clear from the legislative history of section 4 that itwas the intent of Congress to also exclude from marking requirements traditionalB-B, paint-ball, and pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile throughthe force of compressed gas or mechanical spring action, or a combinationthereof. Accordingly, the notice proposed to exclude from marking requirementslook-alike, non-firing, collector replicas of antique firearms designed,manufactured, and produced prior to 1898, and traditional B-B, paint-ball,or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force ofcompressed air, compressed gas or mechanical spring action, or any combinationthereof. In response to the March 14, 1989 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the TechnologyAdministration received twenty-eight comments, five from manufacturers,vendors, or their representatives or attorneys; ten from police officialsat various levels of government; four from State legislators and executiveofficials; seven from interested members of the public; and two from elementsof the U.S. Government. Eight of the commenters fully supported the regulation,thirteen supported the regulation but recommended changes, four took theposition that a total ban on realistic toy guns was necessary and thereforeopposed the regulation as too weak, and three took no position. The two most frequent comments about the regulation were, first, that themarking requirements should be changed to eliminate the recessed orangeplug as an acceptable marking, and second, that a complete ban on realistictoy guns was needed. Eight commenters raised the first issue and five raisedthe second. No changes are being made to the regulations at this time asa result of either comment. The Technology Administration is awaiting theresults of a study by the Director of the National Institute of Justice,mandated by section 4(e) of the Act, before deciding whether to removethe recessed orange plug as an acceptable marking. That study is a technicalevaluation of the marking system established by the Act and of the alternativemarking systems being implemented by this regulation. The Act requiresthat study to be completed within nine months of enactment, or no laterthan August 5, 1989. With respect to the comments requesting a completeban on realistic toy guns, the Secretary of Commerce has no authority underthe Act to take such action.Other comments received are described below, listed by commenter. Amongthe five manufacturers, vendors, and their representatives, all generallysupported the methods of marking contained in the proposed regulation.However, three requested changes in andSection; 1150.1 ``Applicability''of the regulation to make clear the intent of Congress that the regulationdid not apply to toy, look-alike or imitation firearms that are non-firingreplicas of an antique firearm modeled on a real firearm designed, manufactured,and produced prior to 1898. The final regulation has been revised to accommodatethis request. One commenter requested an exemption from the regulationsfor airguns and look-alike guns marketed to the adult buyer; another commenterrequested that section 1150.5, dealing with preemption of marking requirementsby state and local governments, be strengthened. These requested changeshave not been made, because the Secretary of Commerce has no authorityunder the Act to make the requested changes. Among the ten police officials, all generally supported the proposed regulation,although as discussed above, six of the ten questioned the effectivenessof a recessed orange plug without additional marking. In addition, twoof the ten commenters suggested the inclusion of BB guns and the like underthe scope of the regulation. Because the exclusion of BB guns is statutorilymandated by section 4(c) of the Act, the requested change was not made.Four comments were received from representatives of state governments,three supporting the regulation and one opposing it. The Consumer ProtectionBoard of one state fully supported the regulation, as did the Departmentof Human Resources of a second state. The Consumer Council of a state Departmentof Agriculture supported the alternative marking schemes, but questionedthe utility of the recessed blaze orange plug, recommending eliminationof that method of marking. One state Senator opposed the regulation, stronglysupporting in its place a total ban on toy guns and look-alikes. Seven comments were received from the general public, four generally supportingthe regulation and three preferring a total ban on toy guns and look alikes.Finally, materials were received from Senator Cranston of California andthe National Institute of Justice, neither of which specifically commentedon the regulation. The final rule repeats the blaze orange plug method of marking establishedby the Act and repeats the preemption set forth in the statute. In allother respects it grants waivers and allows less restrictive methods ofmarking. Accordingly, since the rule thus grants or recognizes an exemptionand relieves restrictions, under section 553(d) of the Administrative ProcedureAct (5 U.S.C. 553(d)) it may and is being made effective without a 30 daydelay in effective date. <ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Information </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 The Under Secretary for Technology has determined that this rule is nota major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291because it will not result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local government agencies or geographic regions; or,(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S. based enterprises tocompete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Therefore, preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not requiredunder Executive Order 12291. Executive Order 12612 This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. Executive Order 12372 This rule does not involve Federal financial assistance, direct Federaldevelopment, or the payment of any matching funds from a state or localgovernment. Accordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 12372 arenot applicable to this rule. Executive Order 12630 This rule does not pose significant takings implications within the meaningof Executive Order 12630. Regulatory Flexibility Act The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the ChiefCounsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration at the time thisrule was proposed that, if it were adopted as proposed, it would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesbecause the alternative markings conform to existing industry practicesfor most toy, look-alike, and imitation firearms, thus reducing the rule'simpact to only where such practices are not followed. As a result, a RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis is not required to be prepared under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act. National Environmental Policy Act This rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment.Therefore, an environmental assessment or Environmental Impact Statementis not required to be prepared under the National Environment Policy Actof 1969. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 1150 </ITAG>Commerce, Business and industry, Labeling, Hobbies, Imports, Exports, Shipping,Toys, Transportation, Freight, Incorporation by reference. <ITAG tagnum="6">Lee W.
