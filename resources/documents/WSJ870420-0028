Chairman Lee A. Iacocca toiled one year for a dollar during the company's dark days, but he also has accumulated a variety of stock options and incentives during his tenure. Last year he reaped the rewards.    The company's proxy statement, released last Friday, said Mr. Iacocca received a total of $20.6 million in 1986, primarily from the exercise of stock options and a lump-sum payment of Chrysler shares. Also included was $1.7 million in salary and bonuses.    &quot;A lot of our executives, Mr. Iacocca included, came to Chrysler at far less than they were earning or could have earned at other places,&quot; a company spokesman said. &quot;A lot of the stock options they're exercising now were given then in lieu of higher salaries . . . They took risks, and it paid off.&quot;    Mr. Iacocca's combined salary and bonuses were below that received by Ford Motor Co. counterpart Donald E. Petersen, whose salary and bonuses totaled almost $2 million, according to Ford's proxy statement, also released Friday. Mr. Petersen also realized gains totaling $2.4 million from the exercise of stock options.    Mr. Petersen's combined salary and bonuses, which grew 37% from 1985, benefited from Ford's 31% increase in earnings for the year. Mr. Iacocca's salary and bonuses grew 5% even though Chrysler earnings dropped 15%.    General Motors Corp.'s chairman, Roger B. Smith, received a combination of salary and cash bonus, stock bonuses and a performance achievement award totaling about $1.7 million, according to the company's proxy statement, which was released Thursday. The total was down roughly 10% from 1985 because the company's earnings sank 26%. Mr. Smith didn't exercise any stock options.    A large part of Mr. Iacocca's gains came from a payment of 337,500 Chrysler shares, stemming from a 1983 agreement which promised the payment if he stayed with the company through 1986. When he received the stock in November, it was valued at $9.3 million.    Mr. Iacocca stands to make similar huge sums in the future. Under the same 1983 agreement, he will get an additional 112,500 shares, if he stays with Chrysler, at the end of this year. In February, he announced a new agreement providing more stock grants and stock options if he stays with the company through 1991.    Last year, Mr. Iacocca also reaped a $9.6 million gain by exercising stock options. That action was popular last year among other Chrysler executives as well. The executives, including Mr. Iacocca, realized gains totaling $18.1 million. Many of them were given options to buy Chrysler stock at $6 a share in the early 1980s when it was trading around $4, the spokesman said. Chrysler's stock, which has split several times since then, closed Thursday at $35.25.    Ford executives, who also have seen the company's stock price increase sharply in recent years, gained a total of $8.3 million last year by exercising stock options. </TEXT></DOC>
