Perry and Gerald F. Seib (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis, in their first debate, traded charges about national security, the deficit, patriotism and drug policy.    In a highly stylized format that nevertheless saw some snappish exchanges, both candidates achieved at least some of their goals. Mr. Bush avoided making any serious gaffes, while striking at his opponent in spirited fashion. Mr. Dukakis took the offensive at the very start, and hammered home many of his standard criticisms of Mr. Bush and the Reagan administration.    But both also had problems. Mr. Dukakis wasn't always successful in deflecting Mr. Bush's charges that he is a liberal, out of the mainstream on issues ranging from government spending to crime to defense. And Mr. Bush sometimes seemed to get lost in his own rhetoric-making, repeating, for example, references to &quot;a thousand points of light,&quot; a concept he used in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention but which seemed to escape most of the audience at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. At one point, the vice president lost his train of thought.    Both sides, predictably, claimed victory. Bush strategists said their man had effectively painted his opponent as a liberal. Bush political director Rich Bond said: &quot;The debate proved the Democratic nominee is outside the mainstream on the left of the political spectrum.&quot;    The Dukakis camp claimed the vice president avoided issues, was too rambling and spent most of the 90-minute debate on the defensive. &quot;Bush was so intent on stringing a liberal label on Dukakis that he forgot what the purpose of the debate was,&quot; asserted campaign chairman Paul Brountas.    An instant poll of 639 voters by ABC News showed that 44% thought Mr. Dukakis won while 36% thought Mr. Bush was the winner, and 20% called it even. These quickie polls are normally not especially reliable, but this one may fairly suggest neither candidate scored a convincing victory last night.    Mr. Dukakis seemed to score heavily when he criticized Mr. Bush's controversial selection of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate. &quot;The notion of President Quayle is a very, very troubling notion,&quot; he said.    Mr. Bush sought to defend his selection, saying of the 41-year-old Mr. Quayle: &quot;I'm putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30s and in their 40s.&quot;    Early in the debate, Mr. Dukakis attacked Mr. Bush and the Reagan administration for dealing with Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, who is under indictment in the U.S. as a drug dealer. The Massachusetts governor asked how proper values could be instilled in the nation's children while the government was involved with a man such as Gen. Noriega.    Mr. Bush responded that seven administrations had dealt with Gen. Noriega, unaware of the Panamanian's alleged involvement in the illegal drug trade. And he added that it was the Reagan-Bush administration that indicted him.    The two candidates tussled over political ideology. Mr. Bush talked again about Mr. Dukakis's membership in the American Civil Liberties Union, which he said wants, among other things, to get rid of movie ratings.    &quot;I don't want my 10-year-old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie,&quot; he said. &quot;I come from a different point of view and I think I am more in touch with the mainstream of America,&quot; Mr. Bush added.    Mr. Dukakis said that when Mr. Bush calls him a &quot;card-carrying member of the ACLU,&quot; and keeps repeating it, &quot;of course the vice president is questioning my patriotism. And I resent it. I resent it.&quot;    Overall, Mr. Dukakis probably was strongest on domestic issues. He attacked the vice president's proposal to reduce the capital-gains tax rate to 15% from 28%, calling the proposal &quot;a tax cut for the wealthy 1% of the people in this country.&quot; The proposed tax cut, Mr. Dukakis said, would amount to &quot;an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year -- why, that's more than the average teacher makes.&quot;    The Democratic nominee also hit hard on the need for more health care, support for education and better housing for low-income to moderate-income Americans.    Mr. Bush sharply responded to Mr. Dukakis's charges that the Reagan administration has provided inadequate support for housing. He noted that interest rates were 21.5% during the final days of the Carter presidency. And, he said, the Reagan administration had cut those rates in half.    The candidates disagreed on the abortion issue. Mr. Bush, who favors a constitutional amendment banning abortion except in special cases, said he hadn't &quot;sorted out the penalties&quot; that should be imposed on women having abortions and their doctors. Mr. Dukakis responded: &quot;He's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.&quot;    Mr. Bush attacked the Massachusetts governor for vetoing a bill to require school teachers to lead pupils in the pledge of allegiance and for Massachusetts' prisoner-furlough program. Mr. Dukakis said that Mr. Bush, as the Senate's nominal presiding officer for 7 1/2 years, never urged that its sessions begin with the pledge. And Mr. Dukakis pointed out that the federal government had furloughed 7,000 drug dealers in the last year.    Mr. Bush may have had some of his better moments on foreign policy. He charged that the Massachusetts governor is a naive advocate of disarmament and trumpeted a string of recent foreign-policy breakthroughs -- the agreement banning intermediate-range missiles, peace talks in the Iran-Iraq War and the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan -- that he asserted were achieved by maintaining a strong national defense.    In response, Mr. Dukakis asserted that the vice president's support for arms sales to Iran -- which he called a &quot;tragedy&quot; -- and for ties to Mr. Noriega reflected flawed judgment.    Both men seemed to harden their positions on the question of the Strategic Defense Initiative, or &quot;Star Wars,&quot; the Reagan administration's proposed missile-defense system.    Mr. Dukakis, who had tried to sound less rigidly opposed to missile defense in recent weeks, flatly declared that spending billions of dollars on Star Wars &quot;in my judgment, makes no sense at all.&quot;    Mr. Bush, who sometimes has vacillated between unquestioned support and skepticism about Star Wars, flatly declared his support for the program, saying: &quot;When it's deployable I will deploy it.&quot;    When the debate turned to defense, Mr. Dukakis seemed to fumble his initial opportunity to show that, despite Bush campaign charges, he isn't for weakening defenses. Rather than talk about defense positions he supports, he instead talked about failings he asserted the vice president has made in judgment on the Iran-Contra affair, ties to Panama and support for Philippine leader Ferdinand Marcos.    Only later did Mr. Dukakis mention that he supports several nuclear weapons systems, including the Stealth bomber, the D5 submarine-launched missile and the advanced cruise-missile. The Dukakis campaign has been trying to stress those points in recent weeks.    Mr. Bush seemed to score more points during the debate, but Mr. Dukakis appeared to have the stronger finish. Mr. Bush hit the points he wanted to hit -- &quot;opportunity and peace&quot; -- but occasionally stumbled and wandered into issues such as &quot;asymmetrical reduction&quot; of U.S. and Soviet forces in Europe that seemed out of place in what was meant to be a thematic summation.    The usually dour Mr. Dukakis, by contrast, hit an almost Reaganesque note. He spoke of his family's immigrant past, of &quot;optimism,&quot; of the American Dream and of wanting &quot;to help that dream come true.&quot; He listed a series of goals that &quot;the best America&quot; should be dedicated to, and declared: &quot;The best America is yet to come.&quot;    The candidates tossed a few carefully rehearsed one-liners at each other, but they weren't very effective.    Criticizing Mr. Bush's support for a variety of spending programs combined with tax breaks, Mr. Dukakis said: &quot;If he keeps that up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.&quot; Mr. Bush, in his one-liner, replied: &quot;That's about as clear as Boston harbor.&quot; Later, Mr. Bush, in a jab at Mr. Dukakis's celebrated ride in an M-1 tank, said he had hoped he could hitch a ride home with the Massachusetts governor &quot;in his tank.&quot;    The evening was free of major gaffes. But at one point Mr. Bush seemed to confuse the Minuteman and MX missiles.    Mr. Bush also seemed to defend U.S. support for deposed Philippines leader Ferdinand Marcos. Mr. Bush recalled flying over the Philippines while he was a World War II Navy pilot and said Mr. Marcos was down below fighting Japanese imperialism. Reports in recent years have raised doubts about Mr. Marcos's wartime heroics.    ---   John E. Yang contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
