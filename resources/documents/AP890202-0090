A Moslem guerrilla leader in Pakistan predicted the Najibgovernment will collapse as soon as the Red Army has left.   Also today, Western journalists saw a convoy of more than 100Soviet trucks and tanks starting out along the Salang Highway, theonly road from Kabul to the Soviet border.   ``State power is in full control of the situation, despite thedifficulties,'' Najib told a news conference in an unheated room atthe Foreign Ministry.   Reporters were not allowed to leave the building during theconference for security reasons, and explosions and artillery firecould be heard.   Najib said his Soviet-backed government cannot be excluded fromany future coalition with Moslem insurgents, who have refused anypower-sharing arrangement and are not party to the U.N.-mediatedaccord under which the Soviets promised to withdraw all their troopsby Feb. 15.   Najib said all Soviet forces would be out ``in the next fewdays.'' He would not elaborate.   Afghan troops are ``capable of independently defending the peopleand the homeland and can give a resolute and mental rebuff to theopposition,'' Najib asserted.   Fears have increased in Kabul because of uncertainty about thearmy's ability to defend the capital against the insurgents, who atseveral points have shut off the flow of food and fuel.   In Pakistan, guerrilla leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar told reporterstoday Najib's regime ``will fall in weeks, not months.''   Hekmatyar, leader of the Hezb-i-Islami guerrilla group, saidmajor cities, including Kabul, will fall without the guerrillashaving to launch large-scale attacks.   Najib expressed optimism that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze might be able to help in a political settlement to theconflict in a planned visit Saturday to Pakistan, a key supporter ofthe guerrillas with the United States.   The president insisted his People's Democratic Party ofAfghanistan will have to be part of any solution: ``Any attempt toexclude the PDPA and its allies in a coalition government will be invain.''   The Soviets intervened in December 1979 to help fight aninsurgency that began a year earlier when Marxists seized power in abloody coup. The Soviet force numbered about 115,000 before thepullout began.   Moscow has assured the Najib government it will continue toprovide military assistance after its last soldiers are gone.   An estimated 1,000 flatbed trucks carrying rocket launchers,ammunition and small missiles move north along the Salang Highwayevery day, Afghan officers stationed along the road have said.   Guerrillas bombarded a Soviet convoy on Wednesday two miles pasta checkpoint north of Kabul.   The Soviets also use the highway to carry flour, eggs, keroseneand fuel to the capital, where food and fuel shortages have beenreported in recent weeks, partly due to guerrilla attacks on convoysmoving on the highway.   The emergency shipments have helped ease the long lines thatformed outside bread shacks. Most lines have disappeared or becomenoticeably shorter.   It was unclear how long the Soviet tranport will continue toKabul, where refugees from the war have more than doubled thepopulation to 2 million.   In Pakistan, officials today said an Afghan military transportplane apparently ran out of fuel and crashed about 20 miles insidePakistan, killing at least nine crew members.   They said the plane went down Tuesday in a remote area of NorthWest Frontier Province, but would not say if the Afghans were tryingto defect.   Searchers recovered nine bodies, some clad in Afghan militaryuniforms, and the remnants of long-range rockets and other arms,said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. They wouldnot identify the type of aircraft.   There was no immediate comment from the Afghan government orstate media.   Pakistan-based guerrillas said Wednesday that 400 governmenttroops defected during weekend assaults in Kandahar, Afghanistan'ssecond largest city. The report could not be independently confirmed.</TEXT></DOC>
