For a 15,000 footwell producing25,000 BPD, production of 0.6 billion BTU/D of natural gas combustionenergy, in additional to roughly 2 billion BTU/D of thermal energy abovea base temperature of 60 Deg.F., is a resonable expectations. Measurementof gas production poses problems foreign to natural gas producers. Theprimary reason is the produced natural gas is usually cool due to gasexpansion and gas/liquid separation normally takes place at temperaturesin the range of 40 to 100 Deg.F. In contrast, the gas/liquid separationtakes place at produced brine temperature on geopressured geothermalwells. Hot gas enters the gas metering equipment. Cooling is then accompaniedby condensation of both water and natural gas liquids. For most of DOE'sgeopressured geothermal well tests to date, the liquid hydrocarbons producedhave been more of a nuisance than a potential economic benefit. The reasonsare small quantities and composition that is unusual in relation to marketableoil. However, hydrocarbon production much higher than expected on thebasis of solubility in brine has occurred on some of the tests. Unexpectedgas and oil production that began during the brine production test ofthe Lear G.M. Koelemay well in 1980 continued on a commercial basis foryears.</TEXT></DOC>
