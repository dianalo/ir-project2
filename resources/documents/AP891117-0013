A priestquoted witnesses as saying government forces were involved.   The government denied responsibility and condemned the slayingsas ``savage and irrational.''   President Alfredo Cristiani told reporters at a news conferencethat he had ordered an investigation. ``The killers will jeopardizefurther the critical situation in our country,'' he said.   The U.S. National Council of Churches also denounced theslayings, and the U.S. ambassador said the slayings would have a``negative impact'' on Cristiani's rightist government.   Two witnesses said about 30 uniformed police or army soldiersentered the campus before dawn and killed the eight ``with lavishbarbarity,'' said the Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit orderleader for Central America. ``For example, they (the troops) tookout their brains.''   Late Thursday, uniformed security officers raided a downtownoffice of the Lutheran Church and arrested 12 foreigners, includingfour U.S. citizens, who work with the church, said Michel Gagne, aconsular officer in the Canadian Embassy. Gagne said the 12 weredetained by the Treasury Police, but the police would not confirmthe report.   Roman Catholic Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas compared thekillings to the slaying of his predecessor, Oscar Arnulfo Romero.That 1980 assassination marked the beginning of years of killingsand kidnappings by right-wing death squads.   ``If this spiral of violence continues, death and destructionwill sweep away many, especially those who are of most use to ourpeople,'' said Rivera Damas after leading a prayer over themutilated bodies.   The slayings came on the sixth day of fierce combat around thiscapital following an attack by guerrillas of the leftist FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.   The dead included Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of Jose Simeon CanasCentral American University, and vice-rector Ignacio Martin-Baro,the country's leading expert on polls and polling procedures. Theother dead priests, all educators, were Segundo Montes, AmadoLopez, Juan Ramon Moreno and Joaquin Lopez Lopez.   Their housekeeper, Julia Elba Ramos, and her 15-year-olddaughter Celina, also were killed, said Tojeira.   ``They did not want to leave witnesses,'' said Eduardo Valdez,director of Jesuit studies at the university.   The educators had received death threats since the heaviestfighting of the 10-year-old war began Saturday, and callers toradio talk shows had vehemently chastised Jesuits as subversivesand demanded their expulsion or punishment.   The extreme right has for more than a decade accused localJesuits and their university of fostering subversive ideology.   Rivera Damas said those who killed the priests ``were motivatedby the same hate that snuffed out the life of Monsignor Romero.''   Romero was killed by a sniper while saying Mass on March 24,1980. Former President Jose Napoleon Duarte blamed extremerightists for that murder and accused rightist ideologue RobertoD'Aubuisson of masterminding the assassination.   D'Aubuisson, a legislator and honorary president of Cristiani'sArena party, has been accused of ties to death squads. Arenaopponents, including the FMLN, have said frequently that theyfeared a resurgence of death squads since Cristiani took over fromDuarte on June 1.   In a communique, the government's National Information Centersaid the crime ``is intended to destabilize the democratic processand increase even more the climate of anguish created by the FMLN.''   The government and armed forces, which denied that troops orpolice were involved, said the killings would be investigated.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler saidthe U.S. ambassador would ask the Salvadoran government Thursdayfor ``a full inquiry into this horrendous act.''   The ambassador, William Walker, called the slayings ``a barbaricact that has not only brought shame to El Salvador but will leave agaping hole in this country's intellectual and academic community.''   Walker compared the killings to the Dec. 2, 1980, slayings bytroops of U.S. Maryknoll nuns Ita Ford and Maura Clarke, Ursulinesister Dorothy Kazel and lay worker Jean Donovan.   ``It is obviously going to have a negative impact on thegovernment of El Salvador,'' said Walker.   He said he did not know anything about the report thatgovernment troops were involved.   The United States has supported a succession of governments inthe civil war against the FMLN. The fighting has taken more than70,000 lives and cost $4 billion in military and economic aid thisdecade.   Lopez Lopez was a native Salvadoran; Ellacuria and the otherswere Spaniards who had become naturalized citizens.   Valdez said the Jesuit slayings occurred about 3 a.m., threehours before the end of a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the city. He saidneighbors reported hearing gunshots, but thought that it was partof the general fighting.   Tojeira said the witnesses had been staying in another part ofthe building and hid while the killings took place. It was amiracle they weren't discovered and murdered, Tojeira said.   He said the terrified witnesses had gone into hiding, did notwant to speak with reporters and did not trust authorities becausetroops were implicated in the killings.   Another priest, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidsoldiers had been posted outside the house since Sunday and raidedand searched it Tuesday.   He said the soldiers had demanded to know who slept in each ofthe bedrooms from which the victims were later roused and murdered.   Four of the victims had been dragged through the residence anddeposited in the yard outside. Trails of blood indicated they hadbeen wounded and might still have been alive while being dragged.   In Rome, the headquarters of the Jesuit order condemned ``thisbarbarous violence that has claimed so many other victims among thepeople of Salvador.''</TEXT></DOC>
