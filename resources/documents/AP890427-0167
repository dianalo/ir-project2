But to almost everyone's surprise, he alsosuspended imports of assault rifles and talked of possible federalcontrols.   Drugs and guns have highlighted the domestic policies of thefirst 100 days of the Bush administration, including an emergencyplan to combat drug-related murders in the District of Columbiawhich became the nation's murder capital in 1988.   A leftover problem and a sudden crisis put the spotlight onother domestic areas in the 100 days that ends Saturday, as theRepublican leader moved carefully in many other policy matters.   Bush sent a major proposal to Capitol Hill to deal with thesavings and loan crisis left from the Reagan years. Congress isgrinding away on the bailout bill, estimated to cost $157 billionover 10 years.   And then the Exxon Valdez ran aground, pouring oil from thegiant tanker into the sea and polluting the Alaska shoreline. Theadministration came in for criticism for not moving fast enough totry to halt the environmental damage. Bush eventually dispatchedTransportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and other top U.S.officials to deal with the cleanup.   But the president made clear from Inauguration Day that dealingwith the drug problem was at the top of his agenda.   ``This scourge will stop,'' Bush declared, adding that it was``the most obvious'' area ``in which we as a society must rise upunited and express our intolerance.''   The president named William J. Bennett the nation's drug czar,charged with the task of coordinating the fight.   But almost immediately Bush's fight against drugs raised anothertough issue, gun control.   Semiautomatic assault-style rifles were becoming increasinglypopular with warring drug dealers around the country, but publicdemands for controls on the weapons didn't take off until January,when innocent children became the victims of a man who opened firewith such a rifle on a school yard in Stockton, Calif. Fivechildren were killed.   Bush, a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association, vowedfor the first six weeks in office that he opposed any ban on therapid-fire assault-style rifles.   He maintained that stance even though his wife, Barbara, toldThe Associated Press just two weeks after her husband'sinauguration that she fears guns and thinks assault weapons shouldbe banned.   Faced with a growing public outcry against the weapons, Bushrelented a bit.   Less than a month later, the president asked Bennett to lookinto the situation and revealed at a news conference that he hadtold Bennett, ``if you come to me with a sensible answer that takescare of the concerns that I've felt over the years, I'll take ahard look at it, and I'll work with you to that end.''   The initial suspension on imports of semiautomatic weapons,announced March 14, came only a few days after Bennett was sworn inas director of the office of national drug control policy, and theannouncement came out of Bennett's office.   Bush dismissed speculation that the White House had directedthat Bennett's office handle the announcement to place somedistance between the suspension and Bush. When the administrationexpanded the suspension a month later to include 24 models ofweapons that had been left out of the original ban, theannouncement came out of the White House.   The president is a lifelong member of the National RifleAssociation, which was clearly not thrilled by the wayward path ofits most well-known member. But the powerful lobby kept its powderdry when the first suspension of imports took effect, saying theaction would cool off the public outcries over the weaponstriggered by the schoolyard shootings Jan. 17 by Patrick Purdy, a24-year-old drifter, in Stockton, Calif.   The NRA denied allegations by an administration source that ithad delivered messages through third parties to Bennett threateninghis political future because of his stand on the weapons.   Irwin Kahn, a Republican National Committeeman and machine gundealer who also owns a $23 million office furniture company inOhio, said Bush had no other option but to suspend the imports.   ``I think it's the only thing he could have done ... What he didwas defused, temporarily, a situation that is being totallyoverreacted to,'' Kahn said in a telephone interview.   As for the drug-related violence in the District of Columbia,Bennett outlined an emergency plan April 10 to combat the problem.In doing so, he blasted Mayor Marion Barry Jr.'s handling of theissue, which brought a comment from White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater that ``We are in this to solve the drug problem, not topick fights.''   The administration had hoped to have a comprehensive drug, crimeand gun package ready to announce during Bush's four-day trip thisweek, but it did not materialize. White House Chief of Staff JohnSununu said the package is a week to 10 days away.   The president's budget proposal for fiscal 1990, starting Oct.1, reflected his interest in the drug war by requesting $5.5billion to fight the battle, almost a $1 billion increase overspending this year and about $236 million more than PresidentReagan had sought for 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
