Causes include perforation followingrigid and fiberoptic endoscopy, bouginage, breakdown of surgical anastomoses,and protracted vomiting. No matter what the cause, this disorder is associatedwith a high morbidity and, in patients in whom no intervention occurs,a definite mortality. In the past, surgery has been the treatment ofchoice. Although percutaneous drainage techniques have been utilizedin some cases, they are frequently less attractive due to the locationof the esophagus and its proximity to thoracic organs and vascular structures.The authors drained a total of eight esophageal perforations througha transesophageal route with minimal patient morbidity. The authors reportthese cases with discussion of the techniques and patient follow-up.</TEXT></DOC>
