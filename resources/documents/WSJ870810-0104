Canada has barred foreign acquisitions of financially healthy oil and gas companies for more than a decade, and it restated the ban just two months ago. A shift in the policy could create a rush of acquisitions by foreign-owned oil companies anxious to boost their investments in Canada.    Robert Evans, a spokesman for Canada's energy minister, said he couldn't predict the government's reaction to Bow Valley's proposed acquisition, but he said the proposal &quot;doesn't appear to conform to the policy.&quot;    Peter Caskey, a senior official with Investment Canada, a government agency, said he expects British Gas will attempt to overcome the policy by demonstrating that its investment would provide net benefits to Canada. &quot;It's a major question that will have to be reviewed when the case comes in,&quot; he said.    As previously reported, British Gas has agreed to boost its stake in Bow Valley to about 33% from less than 5% currently through a 575 million-dollar purchase of stock from Bow Valley's treasury. The agreement also involves an option to raise the holding to 51% by 1990 through the purchase of additional common stock from the treasury for about 800 million dollars.    The proposed transaction puts the conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in a difficult position because it wants to encourage foreign investment without irritating Canadian nationalists. These nationalists already are furious about the proposed 5.2 billion-dollar takeover of financially troubled, Calgary, Alberta-based Dome Petroleum Ltd. by a unit of Chicago-based Amoco Corp.    Russell MacLellan, energy spokesman for the opposition Liberal Party, called the Bow Valley takeover a &quot;blatant conflict&quot; with existing policy. He added that his party doesn't see &quot;any need for the takeover of Bow Valley by foreign interests.&quot;    In June, after the Dome-Amoco controversy, Canada's energy minister, Marcel Masse, reaffirmed the oil and gas investment policy in a speech in New York. &quot;We do not approve the acquisition of healthy, Canadian-controlled firms valued in excess of five million dollars, though we are prepared to consider the acquisition of Canadian-controlled firms that are in clear financial difficulty,&quot; he said.    &quot;Our policy of refusing acquisitions of healthy Canadian-controlled companies grows from a very real concern that Canadians benefit from the exploitation of our resource wealth,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;It is also a concern that is not likely to disappear.&quot;    Still, the government gave mixed policy signals earlier this year by failing to block the 855 million-dollar takeover of financially healthy, Calgary-based Husky Oil Ltd. by a Hong Kong investor, Li Ka-shing. In that case, the government decided that Mr. Li's purchase of 43% of the stock wasn't a foreign takeover. The ruling was made partly as a result of the fact that Mr. Li's 23-year-old son, Victor Li, who purchased an additional 9% of the stock, had recently become a Canadian citizen.    Despite the political risks, many observers expect that Ottawa also will clear the Bow Valley takeover. &quot;I think it will get careful examination, and there is a real possibility it will be approved,&quot; said William Gatenby, chairman of the Canadian Petroleum Association, an industry lobby group.    Mr. Gatenby, who is also president of Texaco Canada Resources Ltd., a unit of White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco Inc., added that capital for the Canadian oil industry &quot;has to be sought on an international basis.&quot;    If British Gas's proposal succeeds, industry experts said, it may be the first clear-cut foreign takeover of a financially healthy Canadian oil company since the 1960s. They added that other foreign oil companies may also be encouraged to test Ottawa's will.    Already, many foreign-controlled companies have publicly acknowledged they are looking for Canadian oil and gas assets, including the Canadian units of Texaco; Royal Dutch/Shell Group, an Anglo-Dutch concern; and London-based British Petroleum Co.    &quot;There could be an avalanche of activity if the policy is relaxed,&quot; said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst with Peters andamp; Co. in Calgary. </TEXT></DOC>
