Officials of both USX Corp.'s U.S. Steel Group and InlandSteel Industries Inc.'s Inland Steel Co. wrote to LynnWilliams, union president, asking him to reopen contracts,citing mounting industry losses and the prolonged recession.Inland Steel President Robert J. Darnall said the companyexpects to post a loss of more than $100 million for 1991because of falling demand and prices and that this year'sprojections &quot;appear just as disappointing.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, U.S. Steel's president, Thomas J. Usher, saidthe &quot;steel industry is in crisis.&quot; He noted that the companywas concerned when it reached a pact last year that thecontract would affect its ability to compete, especially withnonunion plants or spun-off mills with more favorable laborterms. &quot;Those fears have now been realized,&quot; he wrote, notingthat those companies continued to report profits and makeinroads into markets traditionally served by majorsteelmakers.   Inland's contract with the Steelworkers expires in July1993 and U.S. Steel's contract expires in January 1994.   In his letters to both companies, Mr. Williams said theunion was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about the U.S. economy and thesteel industry, but wasn't &quot;in a position to reopen ouragreements.&quot; However, he said he wanted to meet with Messrs.Usher and Darnall. U.S. Steel had no comment, but Inland saidit welcomes an opportunity to meet with the union.   The Steelworkers began negotiating the current labor pactsin 1989 and established a so-called pattern for the industry,which at the time was riding a two-year boom. Still, somesteelmakers and Wall Street analysts called the pact thatrestored wage concessions and provided some additionalbenefits too generous for the industry's tenuous recovery.   But if the union had agreed to reopen the U.S. Steel andInland pacts, other steelmakers would demand similarconcessions, thus unraveling the hard-fought patternagreement, said Christopher Plummer of WEFA Group, aneconomic forecasting concern.   Now steelmakers, some of which have been losing moneysince mid-1989 on an operating basis, must look elsewhere tocut costs or raise money, which could mean the sale of assetsor streamlining operations. &quot;If we see continued weakness inthe next three to six months, they're going to need cash,&quot; hesaid. Labor is one of the few rising costs that a company cancontrol, he noted.   None of the other major steelmakers has requested suchcompany-wide concessions. Bethlehem Steel Corp. is talking tothe union about new labor terms at its three Pennsylvaniaplants. LTV Steel Co., a unit of LTV Corp., is also talkingto the union about a new contract, but that is part of thecompany's ongoing attempt to emerge from Chapter 11bankruptcy-law protection.   National Steel Corp., also struggling with high-costproblems, didn't ask the union for concessions, but did askworkers to improve productivity. In August, top companyofficials visited plants and told workers that unless thecompany posted profits in the second half, it would facebankruptcy protection. Since then, National Steel saidquality has improved and so have costs and productivity,adding that the company should be profitable in the secondhalf and fourth quarter of 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
