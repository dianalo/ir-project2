that supposedly clarified the future of Windows,Presentation Manager, and other systems software products.andP;  What does theclarification mean?andM;Good question.andP;  Like many of the journalists and analysts who attended theIBM/Microsoft announcement, we felt that we'd been watching a carefullyscripted combination of substance and fast shuffle.andP;  Officially, IBM (in theperson of Entry Level Systems vic president Jim Cannavino) says that Big Bluewill now &quot;endorse&quot; Windows for &quot;entry-level&quot; hardware, and will drop anyplans to create its own DOS-based version of Presentation Manager (theso-called PM Lite).andP;  At the same time, Microsoft (according to Bill Gates)will try &quot;bringing down the entry point&quot; for OS/2 by squeezing it into threemegabytes--with &quot;a good chance&quot; that it will even reach two megs.andP;  Cannavinoand Gates also promised a true 32-bit version of OS/2 for 386- and 486-basedmachines, and a convergence of their currently incompatible LAN products.andM;That's all pretty straightforward stuff.andP;  But the Windows vs.andP;  PresentationManager issue has become so intensely political (Soft letter, 11/7/89) thathardly anyoen seems willing to take the announcement at face value.andP;  Theprevailing theory--at least among the skeptics--is that IBM traded a lukewarmpublic endorsement of Windows for Microsoft's private promise to keep Windowsfrom further cannibalizing Presentation Manager sales.andP;  If that's the correctreading, then IBM in fact has thrown important support to the anti-Windowsfaction led by Lotus, WordPerfect, Borland, and Software PublishingCorp.--companies that all decided to skip Windows and develop directly forPresentation Manager.andM;Did Microsoft actually promise to cut back on Windows development?andM;Another good question.andP;  Again, the official line is that IBM and Microsofthenceforth will devote &quot;the majority of their application and systemsdevelopment resources&quot; to OS/2 and, &quot;beginning in the second half of 1990,plan to make their graphical applications available first on OS/2.&quot;andO;According to the IBM's press release, moreover, &quot;Microsoft stated thatWindows is not intended to be used as a server, nor will future releasescontain advanced OS/2 features such as distributed processing, the 32-bitflat memory model, threads, or long file names.&quot;andM;The anti-Windows crowd says that such promises mean that Windows has been&quot;neutered&quot; (to use Jim Manzi's colorful phrase).andP;  However, Windows developerssay they've been promised that nothing will be taken out of the Windows 3.0beta versions they now have in hand.andP;  And Microsoft's Steve Ballmer, whoheads the company's systems development, told Computerworld: &quot;We haven'tcapped Windows in any way, shape, or form.&quot;andM;So who's right?andM;In the final analysis, the truth matters much less than politicalimpressions.andP;  If Microsoft can convince corporate standard-setters thatWindows is alive and well (and backed by IBM), Windows could become thedominant graphical environment for DOS-based hardware.andP;  However, if thosestandard-setters begin to think that Windows has become the softwareequivalent of the PCjr, nothing Microsoft does to enhance Windows will havemuch effect.andM;Moreover, the anti-Windows consortium is clearly trying to make a persuasivecase that Windows is inherently too underpowered for serious graphicalapplications.andP;  Just two hours after the IBM-Microsoft press conference, Lotusand WordPerfect gathered the Comdex press together again to announce a jointPresentation Manager-based development program that will result in commonlook-and-feel conventions and tight integration between 1-2-3/G, now in beta,and WordPerfect's PM word processor, due out next year.andP;  Besides, scoringpoints over &quot;the M company&quot; for professionalism and candor (&quot;we're the niceguys,&quot; Pete Peterson pointed out), Lotus and WordPerfect showed off productsthat actually use OS/2's features in important, interesting ways (in fact,Byte promptly named 1-2-3/G the &quot;best of show&quot; software product).andP;  Once moredevelopers start exploiting Presentation Manager's true power, we suspectWindows will begin to look pretty anemic by comparison.andM;Does the Windows announcement hint at any changes in IBM's own strategy?andM;IBM has been trying to leverage OS/2 into a quasi-proprietary operatingsystem by controlling key pieces of the environment--notably thecommunications and database components.andP;  That strategy didn't play well withMIS managers, who aren't eager to give up the benefits of an open PC standardfor some ill-defined OS/2 connectivity benefits.andP;  So IBM has now announcedthat most of its OS/2 Extended Edition features will be available soon &quot;toall OS/2 users.&quot;andP;  That's a fairly dramatic change in tactics.andM;But we suspect IBM' has just signalled an even bigger shift--one that couldreshape the whole PC marketplace.andP;  Cannavino used the IBM/Microsoft pressconference to announce that it's now IBM's position (and Microsoft's) that386- and 486-based machines will become &quot;the platform for the '90s.&quot;andP;  And totake full advantage of this platform, the two companies plan to release a32-bit version of OS/2 by mid-1990.andM;Which raises an interesting question: What happens now to the 286?andP;  Cannavinosays Microsoft and IBM will still support a separate 16-bit version ofOS/2--but we have a strong suspicion that 16-bit OS/2 will turt out to be atransitional environment that fairly quickly ends up in the IBM orphanage, leaving the 286 almost exclusively as a DOS (or DOS Windows) platform.andM;That scenario certainly won't be popular with the owners of several million286-based PS/2s, who will wake up one morning and find that their &quot;OS/2capable&quot; machines just turned into &quot;entry-level&quot; DOS systems.andP;  (Watching IBMexecutives beat around the bush on this issue will become one of the greatspectator of the next few years, we suspect.)andM;Nevertheless, splitting the market explicitly on the basis of hardware may bethe single best answer to the whole Windows vs.andP;  Presentation Manager mess.andO;Instead of trying to graft a flawed version of OS/2 onto the &quot;brain-dead&quot;286, IBM and Microsoft get to start over again with a cleaner, more powerfulhardware environment.andP;  The market gets an unambiguous message: The 286 ispart of the messy but interesting DOS world: the 386 belongs to the moredisciplined OS/2 world.andP;  And developers will know what platforms to targetwithout having to keep an eye on the latest political scorecard.andM;If that's what IBM is trying to sneak past us, we like it--very much.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
