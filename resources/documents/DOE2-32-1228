Polyimides I-V showed a high resistanceto radiation over 50 MGy under non-oxidative irradiation. Under oxidativeirradiation they deteriorated at doses which were only 1/5 to 1/10 asstrong as those used for non-oxidative irradiation. Measurements of thei.r. spectra and dielectric properties of polyimide I showed that thedeterioration of mechanical properties under non-oxidative irradiationwas mainly brought about by crosslinking. Under oxidative irradiation,mechanical properties were degraded by chain scission on imide and diphenylether moieties.</TEXT></DOC>
