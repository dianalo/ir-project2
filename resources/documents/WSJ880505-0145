He wobbles up to the Compleat Angler Bar here, flips down a wad of fifties and hundreds and places his order. Scotch on the rocks. Cocaine chaser.    That used to be a Bimini specialty, but alas, the barman has trouble delivering on the chaser. &quot;A year ago I'd come in here and get rocks of coke as big as tennis balls, no problem,&quot; the alleged insurance man grumbles, appalled by the deteriorating service. &quot;What's happening to this island?&quot;    What's happening? Serious withdrawal. Bimini used to be a sordid little paradise of cheap drugs, fast deals and easy money, all just 45 miles east of Miami. But a year ago, U.S. Customs and the Royal Bahamas Defense Force began parking speedboats off Bimini's coast, chasing most of the big-time dealers to other waters. Now the drugs are drying up. The populace is bummed. The economy is strung out. And the only hope may be an invasion by Communist Chinese.    &quot;Life here was a constant party,&quot; laments J.E. Strachan, Bimini's only official banker. &quot;When you've flown so high, man, you come down hard.&quot;    Biminites have never known a hangover like this. Mr. Strachan's bank, a tiny branch of the Royal Bank of Canada the size of an overgrown hot-dog stand, once sent $1 million a month back to its parent in Nassau. That has slowed to a trickle, drying up credit on Bimini and starving the whole Bahamian banking system for funds.    Real-estate projects died in midboom, and half-built houses are surrendering to tropical weeds. The islands' leading economic indicator -- sales of TV satellite dishes -- is off nearly 90% by some estimates. Unemployment may top 60%; on Bimini in the past 10 years, there hasn't been much to do besides work in the drug trade or go fishing. Even nature seems to be turning against the islanders: A mysterious blight is killing off the palm trees.    U.S. drug-enforcement officials believe they and their Bahamian counterparts have saved Bimini from the international drug lords. But Bimini never asked to be saved, and it isn't taking this lying down. The first time one of the new customs speedboats hauled a smuggler and his pot boat to the main dock last summer, a surly crowd pelted the authorities with stones, forcing them to fire shots into the air and flee. Last month a customs boat ran aground just offshore. By the time the crew returned with help, Biminites had spattered the $100,000 vessel with small-arms fire.    &quot;The police are harassing everyone, and it's ruining us,&quot; says Jackie Bullard, a young shopkeeper, speaking for many Bimini merchants who've seen their business crash along with the drug action. In a voice thick with horror, she adds: &quot;My god, if this doesn't let up, we may have to go back to fishing and farming.&quot;    Typical island trades never did hold much allure in Bimini. For nearly three centuries, sin has been its money crop. The place is a smuggler's dream: A pair of spindly islands flung into turquoise waters in a vague horseshoe shape, with a glassy harbor and many discreet coves and crannies, almost within sight of the voracious maw of Miami. Best of all, it's Bahamian, which has meant that the bank kept secrets and the authorities were sometimes reasonable, from a smuggler's point of view.    Over the years, these attractions have drawn some of the world's great pirates and partygoers. Blackbeard prowled here. Ernest Hemingway came to fish, booze it up, blast sharks with Tommy guns and collect material for &quot;Islands in the Stream.&quot; Meyer Lansky and his buddies ran rum from Bimini during Prohibition. Adam Clayton Powell built his church on the northernmost island, and some of his American followers were buried here. So was Gary Hart, come to think of it.    But none of that monkey business ever matched what the drug crowd had been up to since it hit town in about 1979. U.S. drug agents estimate that about 40% of all the cocaine and marijuana pouring into America comes through the Bahamas; of that, at times as much as half may have been run through Bimini, agents say.    Dealers bought off officials and brought elan to the island. Irving Oesterich, a blubbery, heavy-sweating smuggler who later became a federal informant, says he used to bribe authorities by stationing himself in the immigration office at Bimini's airstrip, plastering 100-dollar bills to his perspiring forehead and inviting Bahamian officials to &quot;come and get it.&quot; They always did. &quot;Bimini was wide open,&quot; says Patrick O'Brien, head of enforcement for the customs service in Miami. &quot;Completely wild.&quot;    Profitable, too. Besides bribes, the dealers gave Biminites hundreds of dollars a night to load planes at the airstrip. They paid as much as $20,000 for speedboat romps to South Florida. Cash deposits of $100,000 arrived at the bank in paper bags. Once-poor fishermen wore so much gold jewelry that if they fell overboard they'd qualify as sunken treasure. &quot;You'd see 10-year-old kids walking around with $5,000 in their pockets,&quot; says the Rev. Bruce Rolle, taking a break from his other trade, carpentry. &quot;It was terrible for the moral core of our community.&quot;    No doubt, but it helped make the revelry legendary. &quot;Oh man, I've seen people sit in these bars and blow $4,000 right up their nose in a matter of hours,&quot; recalls Bill, the insurance broker. Colombians passed out free samples, and tips were lavish. &quot;I myself have left $500, if the service warranted it,&quot; Bill says. (He also claims to have made about $8 million over the past 10 years in Bimini, though not in the insurance business.)    Alonzo Torres, a Miami Cuban who says he used to &quot;dabble&quot; in the drug trade but now comes only for the fishing, recalls pulling up to a dock in 1986 in a $35,000 hot-rod speedboat. A barefoot Bahamian in his 20s asked what he wanted for it. &quot;I say fifty grand, just as a joke,&quot; Mr. Torres recounts, sipping beer as the sunlight wanes along the pier at the Bimini Big Game Fishing Club. &quot;The guy's back in 10 minutes with a trash-can bag filled with sixty grand, cash. He says the extra $10,000 is for a tip. Tells me to have a party. Man, this place was out of control.&quot;    Compare that with this: On a recent Saturday night, a few sun-dazed tourists wander up and down the nearly empty main drag. A woman with electro-shock hair babbles in chirpy Bahamian rhythms about Jesus. The Wee Wee Hours Club, once a hangout of Cuban dealers, is boarded up.    A 22-year-old Jamaican named Tony McKintosh asks a stranger in the street if he can get him to America for $800. He came to Bimini because that's how his sister got to America last year, but he has discovered that the Cubans who ferried people to Miami from here are gone, too.    &quot;The action is thin on this isle, man,&quot; he says sadly.    There's still a little to be had. Many Biminites are trying hard to hold onto the old ways. But the scarcity of both product and customer leads to some bizarre entrepreneurial outbursts. In the Island House Bar late one breezy night, a barefoot, bearded man called Karate offers &quot;good cocaine, the finest,&quot; for $40 a gram. Instantly, the bartender enters a rival bid.    &quot;Thirty-five, and I've got quality,&quot; he shouts. Karate counters. Tempers flare. Soon the price is down to a dirt-cheap $15 and Karate has been shoved out the door. &quot;Damn, you can't do honest business around here anymore,&quot; the bartender grumbles.    Others simply sit and reminisce. &quot;Man, you used to be able to scoop money out of the streets,&quot; muses Alfred Saunders, demonstrating his scooping form carefully, so he won't spill the beer he's sipping at 8 on a Sunday morning. He's lounging on the steps of the main customs office. A policeman is within earshot as Mr. Saunders adds: &quot;So man, anything you need? Rock? Herb? Some nice girls?&quot;    What Bimini needs is jobs. Some on the island hope tourism will help replace the drug money, but tourism is down this year. Besides, observes Miss Bullard, the shopkeeper, &quot;no tourist ever spent money the way dealers did. What we need is something with plenty cash.&quot;    This is where the Chinese come in. Really. Biminites say a mysterious group of suit-and-tie Communists from China's state construction company has been spotted prowling the island with calculators in hand. Government sources confirm the Chinese have given thought to bringing the action back to Bimini by building a huge, capitalistic casino. That might be replacing one vice with another, but it's welcome news to many.    Even if the Chinese come, Bimini might have trouble going straight. &quot;We got a lot of zombies that don't ever want to work again,&quot; the Rev. Rolle says. Anyway, a lot of Biminites aren't convinced the drug crackdown will last, among them the young men lazing around at Ebbie's Cool Drink Stand, mid-drunk by midmorning. Johnny, known as Captain Gas because he &quot;likes to drive the speedboat real fast,&quot; speaks for the bunch when he predicts that cocaine cash will flow again.    &quot;It's not gone, it's just underground,&quot; Captain Gas says, toying with a gaudy gold-eagle pendant dangling from his neck. &quot;The sparkle gonna come back on this island someday soon. Riches will come again to Bimini.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
