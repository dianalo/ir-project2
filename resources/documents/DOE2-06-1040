In order to reach thesegoals the Government has placed emphasis on oil substitution, energyefficiency, energy R and D and the market introduction of energy technologiesfor new and renewable energy sources. The energy policy plan of 1985emphasizes the need for efficient use of energy. Nuclear power when phasedout should not be replaced by new capacity of electricity generationto a greater extent than necessary after all electricity conservationand efficiency measures have been implemented. International energy pricesare reflected in Swedish consumer prices. Energy prices are not controlledexcept in cases of general price controls. The Government uses energytaxes not only for fiscal reasons, but also for energy demand managementand environmental objectives. Immediately after the Chernobyl accidentthe Government commissioned the Energy Council to examine the fundamentalquestions of the security of nuclear power against the background ofthe accident and to evaluate whether a faster phasing out of nuclearpower should be considered. To work out the material needed by the EnergyCouncil a special Group of Experts was set up by the Minister. Opinionsdiffer on how much energy use, and especially electricity use, can berationalized. Special measures will have to be taken both to evaluateconservation possibilities and to see to it that they are implemented.(EG).</TEXT></DOC>
