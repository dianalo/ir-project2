Brownsville, Texas, recorded temperatures above 60degrees for the first time in six days, the second longest below-60stretch since records began there in 1878.   Temperatures rose to the 40s and 50s across much of the centraland southern Plains, southwest Louisiana, northern Florida, thesouthern Rockies, southern California and the central Pacific coast.   Temperatures were in the 20s and 30s in a band across thenorthern United States, from the Pacific Northwest to much of thenorthern Atlantic coast.   But cold, still air caused some of Idaho's southwestern andnorthern valleys to fill with smoke from wood stoves, and amandatory burning ban was issued.   Freezing rain fell over portions of western Oregon, makingdriving treacherous Friday morning. Foggy conditions covered much ofCalifornia.   The warmer weather allowed Interstate 5 in California to openafter a two-day shutdown that blocked hundreds of cars and trucks oneach side of the 4,100-foot Tejon Pass through the Tehachapi and SanGabriel mountains.   The steep mountain highway was made impassable by ice and snow.   ``Snow, snow and more snow,'' said Mildred Church, 66, who calledit the biggest storm in 27 years at the mountain hamlet of FrazierPark. ``It's 5 foot deep.''   The town and other communities atop the mountains next to TejonPass were snowed in Wednesday and Thursday. Even the mail couldn'tgo through until Friday. The mail truck from Bakersfield was stuckat the bottom of the mountain.   At Big Bear Lake in the San Bernardino Mountains, 18,000 watercustomers were ordered not to use water unless absolutely necessarybecause numerous burst pipes were draining supplies from storagetanks.   Early Friday, Oakland, Calif., had a low of 38, a record for thedate. Alameda, Calif., recorded a reading of 41, also a record low.   Scattered snow showers were over portions of the Intermountainregion.   The flow of cold air over the warmer waters of the lower GreatLakes continued to produce lake effect snow.   Overnight snowfall at South Bend, Ind., was from 1 to 2 inches,and 2 to 4 inches fell over southwest lower Michigan.   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from zerodegrees at Helena, Mont., to 77 degrees at Homestead, Fla., AirForce base and Miami, Fla.   The low in the nation Friday morning was 11 degrees below zero atHelena, St. Johnsbury, Vt., and Newport, Vt.   The forecast for Saturday was for rain showers widely scatteredfrom northern Mississippi across middle Tennessee to the upper OhioValley. Snow was to continue across the lower Great Lakes andnorthern New England. Snow also was expected over the ColoradoRockies and northeast Minnesota.   High temperatures were to be in teens over northeast Minnesota,upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin and northern Maine; in the 20sand 30s from the northern and central Intermountain region, thenorthern and central Rockies, the northern and central Plains, muchof the middle and upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes tothe northern Atlantic coast; in the 40s and 50s from the northernand central Pacific coast across northern portions of the Southernplateau, the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma, Arkansas and the TennesseeValley to the middle Atlantic coast and the Carolinas; and in the60s and 70s from southern California across southern Arizona and NewMexico, the southern two-thirds of Texas and the Gulf Coast regionto Florida and the southern Georgia coast.</TEXT></DOC>
