It went something like this: 1. Dark eyes and a deep soul. 2. Arelentless hunger for truth. 3. Love for all mankind no matter what. 4.Strong, but peaceful at heart. 5. Average in ways that are really noticeable,above average in ways that are barely noticeable. 6. Animal instincts that fitthe human spirit. 7. A lover who could really touch a person. As soon as Ifinished I ripped it up into a million pieces. It's hopeless, isn't it?; --The Shredder  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DARK EYES, A PEACEFUL HEART AND A SWIFT KICK TO THEGROIN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  GANGSTER OF LOVE  </MEMO><TEXT>  DEAR SHREDDER: I've only got two words for you on your way back to thewastebasket -- BILLY JACK.; DEAR GANGSTER: My wife and I are pretty close witha couple a few houses down from us. Recently the guy has really gone off thedeep end with drugs and my wife thinks I should try to do something. Iwouldn't even think of getting involved, but it's starting to affect ourrelationship because my wife is always on the phone with his hystericalgirlfriend. Plus, he's started to hit me up for money for you know what.; --Don't Know My Place; DEAR MY PLACE: You should definitely try to intervenewith some professionals. But, what's the hurry? I have a cousin who worked hisway through a similar situation with the finesse of a weed whacker. He hadjust moved into a house near a friend who had a drug problem when he realizedhe had a problem, too. He'd never had a lawn before and hadn't known how muchstuff a man needs to keep things tidy. His junkie friend had it all -- gashedge trimmer, sit-down tractor, edger, you name it. &quot;Every time he'd run lowon cash, I'd walk over to his garage and I'd lowball him on anotheressential,&quot; said my cousin. &quot;But the second his garage was empty, I dialed oneof those 800 numbers to get him some serious help.&quot; Apparently everything wentwell after that.; DEAR GANGSTER: Over the past two years I've lost three closefriends. Two to AIDS and one to suicide. Through all this I began to noticethat my other friends were becoming numb to what they called &quot;the death trip.&quot;Now someone I love very much is extremely ill and it doesn't seem to matter tohim. He blows it off. It's not like he's at peace with it -- it's like he justdoesn't care. I don't want to give up on him but I need to know he cares asmuch about life as I do.; -- Not Sleeping;   DEAR NO SLEEP: These days, withthe way some of us are getting traumatized by losing so many of our lovedones, especially to AIDS, it's only a matter of time before the numbness setsin and the repetitiveness destroys the very dignity of the act of dying. It'sa sin to have to say this but, &quot;Is death getting old?&quot;; DEAR GANGSTER: I havebeen married for only about 6 months and already the lug is refusing tocooperate. He's Mr. No Compromise. I tell him, &quot;Listen, we're both startingfresh here and any rules we set up are for the both of us.&quot; But all he has tosay is, &quot;Knock it off, you're not my mother.&quot;; -- Nobody's Mother;   DEARNOBODY'S MAMA: That reminds me of some former neighbors. Every time theyargued, they blasted each other with, &quot;You're not my mother.&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah,you're not my father.&quot; &quot;You're not my big sister.&quot; &quot;Well, you're not my littlebrother.&quot; They must have eventually realized that neither one was so much asthe other's uncle. They weren't related in any way whatsoever. So they got adivorce. Now they greet each other with big grins. &quot;You're not my husband.&quot;&quot;You're not my wife.&quot; Everything is beautiful.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911004  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  57  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  653  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, October 4, 199100278236,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
