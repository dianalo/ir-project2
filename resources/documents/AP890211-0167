In the face of negative news on inflation and a renewed rise ininterest rates, a stretch of five consecutive weekly gains thatcoincided with the start of the new year came to an end this pastweek.   Many analysts say they wouldn't be surprised if the``correction,'' or period of retrenchment, lasted a while longer.   But the bulls argue that such a sequence would actually representa happy development for investors who didn't get a chance to join inthe party earlier.   ``Signs that the current rally is maturing continue to pile up,''said Joseph Feshbach, technical analyst at Prudential-BacheSecurities, in his latest market appraisal.   Over the next few weeks, Feshbach says, the market may wellundergo a ``consolidation'' in which the major averages fallsomewhere on the order of 4 percent to 7 percent.   But he contends ``the bull market is just beginning'' forindustrial stocks in particular. ``Since we remain very bullish longterm, we suggest using the coming consolidation as a buyingopportunity.''   Similarly, the Merrill Lynch Market Letter says a ``fairlyshallow'' pullback is in prospect over the near term.   ``We think a renewed advance in the spring could carry the Dowindustrials to the 2,500 area before a more significant correctionmight occur.   ``A change in investor psychology appears to be contributing moreto the bullish atmosphere than any changes in the outlooks for theeconomy or corporate profits. Investors appear more willing toaccent the positive than the negative.''   This new upbeat spirit got a stern test in recent days when theLabor Department reported a much larger-than-expected rise of 1percent in the producer price index for January, and banks acrossthe country raised their prime lending rates from 10.5 percent to 11percent.   The producer price increase, the biggest in more than threeyears, intensified expectations that the Federal Reserve would soontighten credit further.   At the close on Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrialsstood at 2,286.07, down 45.18 from the week before.   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.49 to 164.01on the week; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-countermarket dropped 3.98 to 402.37, and the American Stock Exchangemarket value index was down 2.11 at 322.77.   Volume on the Big Board averaged 191.09 million shares a day,against 186.79 million the week before.   While brokers naturally like the revived enthusiasm for stocks,they are wary of seeing too much of a good thing. If everyonebecomes a believer in the market, they reason, the rally thatresults could be explosive but short.   Memories remain fresh of what followed the high spirits andcomplacency that prevailed for much of 1987.   At the moment, however, most observers say a healthy amount ofskepticism persists.   ``A good sign _ options traders are still pessimistic,'' assertsthe Merrill Lynch letter. ``Trading in puts (options to sell stock)remains fairly high in relation to trading in calls (options to buystocks).   ``We interpret this indicator on a contrary basis, so recentreadings appear to be a favorable sign for stocks.''   While optimism has been increasing steadily among investmentadvisers, reports Investors Intelligence of New Rochelle, N.Y.,measures of sentiment ``are still bullish and lots of cash is stillon the sidelines.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
