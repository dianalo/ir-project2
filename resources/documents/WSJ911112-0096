So far this year 71 people have been killed in six fatalaccidents. That's the highest death toll since the NationalTransportation Safety Board began tracking commuter airlinesin 1977. And federal investigators are still scrambling tofind out why. &quot;We aren't pushing the panic button,&quot; saysSusan Coughlin, the safety board's vice chairman. &quot;Theinformation doesn't lead us to believe there are systemicproblems in the industry.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Others disagree. &quot;There's no excuse for some of thisstuff. Somebody's not doing his job,&quot; declares JohnGalipault, director of the Aviation Safety Institute inWorthington, Ohio.   What is puzzling is that the record deaths follow thesafest year ever for commuter airlines. All involve planeswith 30 or fewer seats, which carry 55% of commuterpassengers; larger commuter planes haven't had a fatalitysince 1983.   The increased accidents are fueling calls for a tighteningof safety rules for commuter carriers. But a look at thisyear's major crashes shows no common cause. The accidentsinclude:   -- A Continental Express Airlines crash on Sept. 11 nearEagle Lake, Texas, that killed 14 people. The wrecked plane,which had undergone routine maintenance the day before, wasmissing 43 screws in the tail section, investigators found. Aninefoot section of the plane's horizontal stabilizer,located on the tail, apparently dropped off in flight.   -- A July 10 crash involving a commuter plane of L'ExpressAirlines that tried to land at Birmingham InternationalAirport in a severe thunderstorm but instead slammed into aresidential area. Thirteen people died. Wind-shear advisorieswere in effect at the time, and a corporate jet ahead ofL'Express's plane broke off its landing approach twice beforefinally landing safely.   -- An April 5 crash near Brunswick, Ga., that killedformer Sen. John Tower and 22 other people -- the worstcommuter accident in U.S. history. This month federalinvestigators will go to Brazil to conduct flight tests atthe manufacturer to try to determine whether a worn propellershaft rendered the Atlantic Southeast Airlines Embraeruncontrollable. The Federal Aviation Administration hasordered inspections of the propeller shafts on similarplanes.   -- The Feb. 1 collision of a SkyWest Metroliner commuterplane and a USAir 737 at Los Angeles International Airportthat killed all 12 people on the commuter plane. A distractedair traffic controller apparently forgot about the SkyWestplane and cleared the USAir jet to land on the same runway.   The accidents are a blow to industry officials, who notethat commuter airlines have become a vital transportationlink for small and medium-sized cities that have lost servicefrom major carriers because of deregulation. Last year,regional and commuter airlines carried more than 42 millionpassengers in the U.S., up from 15 million in 1980, accordingto the Regional Airline Association.   &quot;Clearly, we have had some human breakdowns,&quot; says JohnFredericksen, president of the trade group, which represents74 regional and commuter carriers. &quot;But the causes are sodivergent that it doesn't give me concern about the industryas a whole.&quot;   Certainly commuter-airline safety generally has improvedmarkedly over the last decade -- with a big exception in1987, when 59 people died in 10 fatal crashes. The fatalaccident rate for commuter aircraft declined to 0.069 per100,000 departures last year, when only four people werekilled, from 0.450 in 1980, according to the NationalTransportation Safety Board. Federal aviation officialsattribute the improved commuter performance to bettertraining and a lower turnover rate among pilots. Turnoverpeaked at 40% in the late 1980s but is probably half that nowbecause the major airlines aren't hiring, according to theRegional Airlines Association.   The FAA has also tightened its safety rules for commuterairlines in recent years. It now requires that most commuteraircraft be equipped with the &quot;black boxes&quot; used byinvestigators to pinpoint the causes of accidents. It plansto require the installation of devices that warn pilots whenthey get too close to the ground. And as of 1995, commuteraircraft will have to be equipped with collision-avoidanceequipment.   Despite the progress, most consumer and safety advocatesbelieve that commuter lines -- at least those using planeswith 30 or fewer seats -- are riskier than major airlines.While the 1990 fatal accident rate for commuter planes wasactually below that for the major carriers, the rate washigher for every other year in the 1980s. And virtually everyother safety statistic shows that the big airlines are safer.   Richard Livingston, head of the Airline PassengersAssociation of North America, believes pilot experience -- orthe lack of it -- is one reason. &quot;Commuter pilots are usuallyless seasoned than those for major airlines,&quot; he says. Hefrets that the turnover rate will pick up again as bigairlines lose pilots to retirement and once again turn to thecommuters for crews. Perhaps, he suggests, commuter pilotsshould be required to stay at the smaller airlines for agiven period of time before moving up to the major airlines.   Moreover, some commuter pilots are being worked to thebrink of exhaustion -- and beyond, contends John O'Brien,safety director for the Air Line Pilots Association. Somemanagers, he asserts, &quot;are taking advantage of the loopholesin the {flight and duty time} regulations to place veryburdensome schedules on pilots. You get fatigued and startmaking mistakes.&quot;   The pilots want the rules tightened and the maximum numberof working hours shortened. Under current regulations,commuter pilots may fly 1,200 hours a year, compared with1,000 hours for major-airline pilots. Anthony Broderick,associate FAA administrator for regulation and certification,says that he's willing to look at the issue but that thelonger hours were approved because commuter pilots, withtheir shorter flights, spend more time taxiing on the groundthan do pilots for major airlines. The Regional AirlineAssociation says that the longer hours are appropriatebecause commuter pilots don't change time zones as frequentlyas pilots for major airlines so they don't have the samejet-lag problems.   Both the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Boardbelieve commuter pilot training needs improvement. One majorelement centers on cockpit resource management, or CRM, whichmost major carriers already use. CRM teaches crews how tobetter respond to emergencies and divvy up their workloads.The safety board is pressing the FAA to require CRM forcommuter crews.   The safety board's Ms. Coughlin notes that while theSkyWest commuter pilots involved in the Los Angeles collisionweren't blamed for the crash, the accident raised a&quot;situational awareness issue&quot; about the commuter crew. Thepilots, who were sitting at the intersection of two activerunways for a few minutes, didn't query the controller abouttheir status and apparently didn't hear that the USAir flighthad been cleared to land on the same runway.   Mr. Broderick says the agency is reviewing and updatingthe commuter rules and will probably propose requiringcockpit resource management. The agency is also consideringother changes designed to improve commuter-pilot training,and to make it more similar to that used for pilots of majorairlines.</TEXT></DOC>
