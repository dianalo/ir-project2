The contract for March delivery on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York settled at $1.0580 a pound, down 16.20 cents, and just 0.2 cent above the day's low. The May contract dropped 15.56 cents to settle at $1.0803, recovering just a cent from the day's low. There isn't a limit on the price change for March and May contracts. Those for July delivery and beyond fell the four-cent-a-pound daily limit.    The March decline was the biggest one-day drop since July 19, 1977, when the unrestricted and about-to-expire July contract fell 27 cents. That drop came with the arrival of a large shipload of green coffee in the U.S., quashing speculation that there wouldn't be enough coffee to deliver against July contracts.    One analyst found a positive note in the trading. Following May's sharply lower opening and despite heavy selling, the contract moved in a range of just slightly more than five cents, said William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.    &quot;That indicates there was good two-way trading, with buying that helped stem the decline,&quot; he said. &quot;Without that demand, who knows how low it might have fallen.&quot; Yesterday may have been the &quot;blow-out day&quot;, when the selling reached its peak, Mr. O'Neill said.    Also, the chance of recovery may be boosted because the significant demand present at this level may encourage buying when the selling ends, he said.    Jon Rosenbaum, chief U.S. delegate to the London meeting, said the talks, which began Feb. 23, failed because a &quot;majority of producers, led by Brazil&quot; weren't prepared to negotiate quota allocation based on both previous exports and reserve supplies. The new criteria were demanded by consuming nations led by the U.S.    Colombia's negotiator said the U.S., Britain and the Netherlands formed a &quot;consuming axis&quot; to hamper agreement.    Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said Brazil was prepared to negotiate allocation in the future but wouldn't be dictated to.    Brazil, which always defended its approximately 30% allocation in the past, again held its ground, trade sources said. But surprisingly, the U.S. was just as stubborn, maintaining its position to the end instead of giving in as it had in prior years, a dealer said.    According to wire service reports, Brazil's delegation entered the latest talks with orders to agree only to reinstitute export quotas, rather than negotiate new ones. Brazil said it was ready to accept the 58-million-bag global quota that prevailed at the time the export quotas were suspended early last year.    Mr. Rosenbaum said the U.S. would have backed an interim solution, under which the old allocation among the 50 producing nations would have stood until the coffee year ends in September. But the U.S. wanted approval of a new, permanent allocation starting Oct. 1.    A follow-up version proposed allocation reflecting export capacity over the past six years. With such an allocation, Brazil, with a scant 1985 crop, the Ivory Coast and several other producers lose market share.    The London meeting ended at an impasse after an extended Monday night session and new talks aren't scheduled until the full 75-nation International Coffee Organization council meets in September. But the ICO's Executive Board has a regularly scheduled meeting March 29, and some traders hope quota talks might resume then. Generally, analysts and trade sources said, it doesn't make sense to let many months pass without further negotiation in view of the chaos in the market.    The likelihood of a trade war was raised by producing-nation delegates who talked to people in the trade, those buyers and brokers said.    But others who attended the meetings took pains to point out that just the talks had broken down, as opposed to the ICO or the International Coffee Agreement, which it administers.    In other futures markets yesterday:    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Most futures finished a bit higher in narrow trading. But British pound futures fell slightly on reports that the Bank of England sold pounds and bought West German marks in overnight trading. Prices got a modest boost from the larger-than-expected 1% decline in the U.S. index of leading economic indicators in January and a 6.8% decline in new home sales, analysts said. But last month's accord among the U.S. and five major trading partners on stabilizing major currencies may be having an impact. &quot;G-6 works, that's about all you can say. They've succeeded in tempering the currency markets,&quot; said Dennis Gartman, president of Gartman Financial Services Inc. in Portsmouth, Va. &quot;It'll take major economic news to get these markets to move.&quot;    PRECIOUS METALS: Gold and platinum futures rose in reaction to a slightly softer dollar and higher energy prices. Some traders and analysts said the weak leading economic indicators also sparked buying. Those numbers could suggest an easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board, possibly leading to higher inflation, said Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metals analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York. Precious metals, especially gold, typically are held as hedges against inflation. Trading, though, was light. &quot;It was so quiet we went out for lunch,&quot; a New York trader said. Gold for April delivery on the Commodity Exchange in New York rose $3.50 an ounce, to $409.10. April platinum contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $6.70, to $529.30 an ounce.    LUMBER: March futures tumbled after the contract exceeded the cash price enough to trigger selling, said Tom Martin, analyst with Stotler andamp; Co. The contract, for delivery on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, fell $9 per 1,000 board feet. Exaggerating the collapse were thin trading and the absence of a limit on price changes in the March contract, which expires next week. The weakness in the March contract undermined later months, which also closed lower, Mr. Martin said. The May contract fell its daily limit of $5. </TEXT></DOC>
