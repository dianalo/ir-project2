 Usually,the needs statement is a proprietary document.andM;The Army last month issued a request for comments for the Sustaining Baseinformation Services (SBIS) program that calls for a single contractor toplan the conversion of a 10-year-old regionalized batch-oriented dataprocessing system to an open systems architecture that will distrbutecomputing power throughout hundreds of installations.andM;Administrative CoreandM;SBIS will be the Army's principal automation infrastructure on which most ofits administrative computing will be done.andP;  It will replace the Army StandardInformation Management System, once known as Viable.andM;Giordano, the program executive officer in charge of the SBIS program, hasadvocated this approach as part of his philosophy that government must tellindustry as much as it possibly can about what it wants them to do.andP;  Anyrisks that came with circulating the statement, he said, were worth taking.andM;Giordano also is the Army's PEO in charge of strategic information systemsand switched systems.andM;Last year, he received the Defense Department's Acquisition StreamliningExcellence Award for his adaptive acquisition strategy.andM;During an interview earlier this year at his office in the Information SystemCommand at Fort Monmouth, N.J., Giordano said his acquisition strategy isbased on keeping alive a dialogue with industry and on challengingrestrictive requirements and regulations.andM;&quot;I like to talk about the laws of bureaucracy,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The first law isthat the people who implement a rule will rarely take the time to determinewhat the purpose of the rule is.andP;  The other law is that most rules contain aprohibitive and a permissive side.andP;  The bureaucrat doesn't look for thepermissive way because that will force him to make a decision,&quot; he said.andM;A Way OutandM;&quot;If you find the prohibitive components of the regulations, you can say noand justify it by explaining that someone else made the decision for you.&quot;andM;In the Army's PEO system, Giordano oversees program managers involved in avariety of strategic systems, telecommunications networks as well as the SBISmanager.andM;&quot;What I preach to my PMs is to never take no for an answer,&quot; Giordano said.andO;&quot;if there are approaches [to an acquisition] that will save time, reducecosts and get you the product you need, then take that approach.andP;  If abureaucrat is there saying you can't do it, challenge him.andM;Challenge BarriersandM;The key to cutting through red tape, he said, is a willingness to challengeanything that stands in the way of efficiency -- &quot;Challenge the regulations,challenge the requirements, challenge the standards.&quot;andM;This willingness to buck the system, he said, also must be applied todocumentation and other potential snags in the acquisition process.andM;&quot;We need to eliminate unnecessary documentation.andP;  Quite often we ask forreams and reams to paper, and the critisism is, 'Who the hell has time toread all the paper?'andP;  My approach used has been to llok very carefully atwhat documentation is being called for and challenge its essentiality, &quot;hesaid.andM;&quot;the point is to look at the documentation requirement in terms of what it'ssupposed to add to our body of knowledge -- what is its value, how does ithelp us in making decisions, how does it help us accept equiment orcomplement the equipment itself?&quot;andM;Giordano also said he and Davis Borland, the director of the Army'sInformation Systems Selection and Acquisition Agency, the contracting agentfor SBIS, believe the army on either adapt its needs to commerciallyavailable solutions or, by publishing its needs in advance, encourageindustry to adapt its production lines.andM;With commercial products, the ArmY's testing requirements needn't cameunnecessary delays, Giordano Said.andM;&quot;Yes, we should test during the proposal evaluation phase -- but only a proofof capability.andM;&quot;You are dealing with something that's produced for industry.andP;  If it's goodenough for industry, it should be a good enougn for us.andP;  No one buysequipment that breaks every five minutes,&quot; he said,andM;According to the SBIS RFC, a systems integrator will develop a conversionplan, complete the first module of the platform and do the contracting workrequired to turn over the rest of the job to another company or companies.andM;Keep the Door OpenandM;Giordano said this approach will ensure that the Army does not get lockedinto a single vendor's solution.andP;  The final component of his adaptivestrategy, he said, is a willingness to take certain risks.andP;  This includes awillingness to issue RFPs asking for commercial solutions that do not yetexist, he said.andM;&quot;When we do that, we're saying that we'll reward the company that mostclosely adapts their production lines to our needs.andP;  But the trick here,&quot; heexplained, &quot;is to avoid a situation when we've accepted a design that becomestroublesome for the company when the production phase begins.&quot;andM;Tprevent companies from exaggerating capabilities in advance of production,Giordano said he prefers using fixed-price contracts and setting a paymentschedule &quot;based not on cost but on performance.&quot;andP;  In short, he said,&quot;wherever possible we want to use the principles of the market, theprinciples of capitalism.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
