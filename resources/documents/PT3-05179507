With this arrangement, according to the present inveniton,      it is possible to prevent the fuse from being broken or disconnected from      the connecting portions by mechanical impacts after connection of the      incorporated fuse. Furthermore, it is possible to minimize the space for      the attachment of the fuse, and thus fuse-incorporated capacitor element      can be maximized in its capacity. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to a solid electrolytic capacitor equipped      with an opening mechanism and more particularly relates to a solid      electrolytic capacitor of this type having a fuse on its anode lead      terminal side. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Conventionally, solid electrolyte capacitors in which a metal such as      tantalum (Ta), niobium (Nb), aluminum or the like for performing a valve      action is employed, are widely used in various electronic circuits, and      the merit thereof has been known as having a small failure rate. The fault      thereof, if it occurs, is often in a mode of a short circuit. When the      short circuit happens, a large short-circuit current flows with the result      that the capacitor element is heated and sometimes the capacitor element      is burnt. </PAR><PAR>  In order to protect other circuit components from this excessive      short-circuit current, it is necessary to open the short circuit to cut      off the failure mode. To deal with this, a fuse is generally used, and      prior arts have been disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laying-open      No.66925/1989, etc. A conventional solid electrolyte capacitor equipped      with an opening mechanism stated above has a fundamental structure as      shown in FIG. 2. That is, a capacitor element 1 comprises a cathode layer      3 and an anode lead 2, and the cathode layer 3 is connected to a cathode      lead terminal 5 with a conductive adhesive 8, whereas a metal piece which      is welded to the anode lead 2 is cross-linked to an anode lead terminal 4      by way of a fuse 6. Further, the whole structure other than part of the      lead terminals is covered by an encapsulating resin. </PAR><PAR>  In the conventional solid electrolyte capacitor, cross-linkage of the anode      lead terminal 4 with the metal piece 10 connected to the anode lead 2 is      performed on the same plane by way of the fuse 6, and whereby causing      drawbacks as follows: </PAR><PAR>  (1) The metal piece 10 is arranged separately from the anode lead terminal      4, so that the fuse 6 may be broken or other connecting portions may be      disconnected by mechanical stress or impacts after the fuse 6 being      attached. </PAR><PAR>  (2) The metal piece 10 and the anode lead terminal 4 are arranged on the      same plane separately from each other, so that connecting them with the      fuse 6 requires a large space, thus making it difficult to increase the      capacity of the capacitor element 1 being incorporated in a limited      outside dimension. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention has been achieved in view of what is discussed above      and it is an object of the present invention to provide a solid      electrolyte capacitor equipped with an opening mechanism which is free      from breakdown of the fuse or disconnection of other connecting portions,      being caused by mechanical impacts after attachment of the fuse, and in      which the capacity thereof can be maximized in a limited size by      constructing a structure not to require a large space for the attachment      of the fuse. </PAR><PAR>  A solid electrolyte capacitor equipped with an opening mechanism comprises      a capacitor element including a cathode layer and an anode lead; a cathode      lead terminal connected to the cathode layer with a conductive adhesive,      solder or the like; a metal being connected to the anode lead by welding;      an anode lead terminal; an electric insulator being sandwiched between the      metal piece and the anode lead terminal to form a three-layered structure;      a fuse for cross-linking the metal piece with the anode lead terminal; and      an encapsulating resin for covering these parts. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing the internal structure of an example      of a conventional solid electrolyte capacitor equipped with an opening      mechanism; and, </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a perspective view showing the internal structure of an      embodiment of a solid electrolyte capacitor equipped with an opening      mechanism according to the present invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  The present invention will be described in detail with reference to the      accompanying drawings. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing an internal structure of an embodiment      of a solid electrolyte cpapcitor equipped with an opening mechanism      according to the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  An anode lead 2 which is implanted on, a capacitor element 1 structured      with tantalum, niobium, aluminum or the like, is connected by welding to a      metal piece 10. A cathode lead terminal 5 is coated with a conductive      adhesive 8 on one side thereof facing to the capacitor element 1, and the      capacitor element 1 is arranged such that a cathode layer 3 thereof faces      the adhesive-coated surface. Thereafter, the conductive adhesive 8 is      hardened with heat to connect the cathode lead terminal 5 with the cathode      layer 3. </PAR><PAR>  Next, between the metal piece 10 connected to the anode lead 2 and an anode      lead terminal 4 is inserted an insulator 7, such as glass-epoxy, polyimide      or the like, having substantially the same size as the metal piece 10, to      form a three-layered structure and is fixed with an adhesive such as epoxy      or the like. </PAR><PAR>  A fuse 6 is disposed in a cross-linking manner between the metal piece 10      and the anode lead terminal 4 by thermo-compression bonding, welding or      other bonding. Then, in order to protect the fuse 6 from the mechanical      stresses caused when the structure is encapsulated with a resin, a silicon      resin 11 is coated to cover the fuse 6 and hardened with heat. </PAR><PAR>  Then the whole structure, other than the external electrodes of the anode      lead terminal 4 and the cathode lead terminal 5, is covered with an      encapsulating resin 9 by way of transfer molding, resin potting or other      methods. At last, the anode lead terminal 4 and the cathode lead terminal      5 are respectively formed into U-shape to thereby complete the product. </PAR><PAR>  As described above, according to the present invention, an anode lead is      welded to a metal piece, and the metal piece and anode lead terminal hold      an insulator therebetween to form a three-layered structure, and a fuse is      disposed in a cross-linking manner to this three-layered structural      portion. As a result, the present invention can provide improved effects      as follows, compared to the conventional arrangement in which a metal      piece and an anode lead terminal are set separately on the same plane: </PAR><PAR>  (1) Since the insulator is sandwiched between the metal piece to which the      fuse is connected and the anode lead terminal, to form an integrated      structure having three layers, the fuse can be readily connected and is      hard to be taken off by the mechanical impact after the attachment, and      thus it is possible to improve the reliability of the products. </PAR><PAR>  (2) The space occupied by the attachment of the fuse can be reduced to      about one-third as compared to the conventional structure. The resulting      vacant space which is brought about by the reduction of the attachment      space for the fuse can be allotted for the capacitor element to be      enlarged. Consequently, it is possible to produce a capacitor in which a      capacitor element having a capacity larger than that of the conventional      one by approximately 30 to 50% can be incorporated into the same external      dimension as the conventional capacitor. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
