Interest rates on junk bonds are already sky-high, and the new-issue juggernaut likely in the next three or four months could push them still higher.    But investors who want to cash in had better take steps to protect themselves. It's not for nothing these bonds are called &quot;junk.&quot;    Junk bonds are bonds rated below Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. or below triple-B-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. Often issued by some of America's most heavily indebted companies, they can be a mine field for the unsophisticated. Wall Street brokerage houses consider them so risky they don't want to take responsibility for selling them to individuals. Junk bonds are simply &quot;inappropriate&quot; for individual investors, says a spokesman for Salomon Brothers Inc.    Even Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the firm that more than any other created the junk-bond market, warns that it isn't the place for most individuals. &quot;Unless you consider yourself fairly sophisticated and willing to spend some time, avoid it,&quot; says Joseph Bencivenga, Drexel's co-director of high-yield research.    Still, with yields that currently exceed 20% in some cases, junk bonds now promise some of the highest returns investors can earn.    For people who just can't say no, here are some ways investment professionals recommend to make venturing into the junk bond market at least a little less dicey:   OPT FOR A MUTUAL FUND: &quot;This is not a market for the faint-hearted. The only way an individual should play it is through a mutual fund,&quot; says Philip Maffei, director of research for McCarthy Crisanti andamp; Maffei, a research and rating unit of Xerox Financial Services Inc.    Mutual funds offer individual investors the opportunity to own part of a diversified portfolio for as little as a few hundred dollars. Market professionals say that for people to achieve adequate diversification on their own, they'd have to buy 10 to 20 bonds at a cost of $100,000 or more.    Funds also offer professional management and research. Of course, there's no guarantee the fund manager is a better bond-picker than the individual investor.    DIVERSIFY INDIVIDUAL HOLDINGS: For those determined to tackle the junk bond market on their own, investment professionals say to spread the risks by purchasing three separate types of junk.    First, there are so-called fallen angel bonds, issued by companies that once had high credit ratings but now face hard times. Several companies in the steel industry, including Bethlehem Steel Corp., are examples of this type.    Then there are &quot;emerging growth&quot; companies, relatively young or small concerns that don't have the track record, the cash flow or the diversification that would bring investment-grade ratings. Several companies in the cable television industry, such as Continental Cablevision Inc., are examples.    Finally, the bulk of the junk bond market is made up of companies undergoing a restructuring, usually a leveraged buy-out that would take the company private in a transaction financed largely through debt. In these cases, bonds are usually paid off by sales of assets rather than by the company's cash flow. Metromedia Inc. is an example of an LBO junk bond.    BUY PUBLICLY LISTED BONDS: They aren't necessarily any safer than other junk bonds, but those traded on stock exchanges can be tracked easily, giving investors an edge if things start to go amiss; price quotes are published daily in many newspapers. And shun bond issues of less than $75 million, which can prove to be illiquid.    DON'T GET TOO GREEDY: Analysts urge individuals to favor bonds currently yielding between about 13% and 15%. Bonds offering lower yields don't compensate investors enough for the risks they're taking, the analysts contend, while yields that are much higher can indicate a seriously troubled company.    LOOK FOR PROTECTIVE COVENANTS: Covenants are essentially the provisions written into a bond prospectus that protect investors. The key words to look for are dividend test, net-worth test and merger or sale test.    A dividend test, which stops the company from paying dividends on its stock or buying stock back, keeps money in the company. A net-worth test requires that the company agree to maintain a certain net worth; if its amount of assets minus liabilities drops below that level, the company agrees to buy back a percentage of its bonds. A merger or sale test prevents a company from selling all its assets and then leaving a shell holding its debts.    But beware of too much fine print. Avoid &quot;tiny deals with fat prospectuses,&quot; Mr. Bencivenga advises. If the prospectuses &quot;have to be bound, versus stapled,&quot; he says, &quot;you've got a problem.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Mutual Funds: ...And Find Out if You're Already in the Pool&quot; -- WSJ Nov. 15, 1988)   ---           Safeguards for Junk Bond Investors    Diversify   -- Consider junk bond mutual funds for diversity and professional management   -- Do-it-yourself types should spread their investment among at least 10 separate bonds, selecting issues from each of three principal types of junk    Buy   -- Bonds listed on stock exchanges   -- Bonds with covenants that promise preferential treatment on other protections to bondholders    Avoid   -- Bonds that are part of small issues (under $ 75 million), which can be illiquid   -- Bonds with the highest yields, often sold by the most troubled companies</TEXT></DOC>
