Japanese prime ministers customarily visit Washington shortlyafter taking office to establish good working relations, but Kaifualso hopes he can use the trip to establish his own diplomaticcredentials and revitalize his government's foreign policy, theofficials said.   Kaifu, who on Aug. 9 became Japan's third prime minister in lessthan three months, is a former education minister with littleexperience in foreign affairs. His Liberal Democratic party, whichpursues conservative policies, has been rocked by a series of moneyand sex scandals that have put diplomatic initiatives on hold.   The 58-year-old prime minister leaves Wednesday for Washingtonand will later visit Mexico and Canada. He will meet Friday withPresident Bush and then visit Boston, where he plans to meet withacademics and watch a Red Sox game, according to Yukio Okamoto,director of the Foreign Ministry's First North America Division.   Bush is expected to seek a commitment from Kaifu that Japan willreform areas of its business and distribution system that the UnitedStates says limit foreign access.   Foreign Ministry officials said Kaifu will tell Bush that Japanis willing to pursue major reform, but that the United States alsomust institute changes if substantial improvement in the tradeimbalance is to be made.   ``Japan is prepared to address her own structural issues, andindeed we have been addressing ourselves to these problems,'' saidMitoji Yabunaka, director of the ministry's Second North AmericaDivision. ``But efforts should be made by both sides.''   Yabunaka said Japan would ask the United States to boost itssavings and business investment rates, work harder to promoteexports, improve its vocational training, and seek long-terminvestments rather than short-term profits.   ``These are very serious issues, and there is no quick fix,'' hesaid.   Japan has made major reductions in tariffs and other importbarriers in recent years. U.S. and Japanese officials have begun tosay that the trade imbalance now stems mainly from social andbusiness structures and practices in both countries.   The United States has said Japan's complex distribution systemand ingrown business relationships make it difficult for foreigncompanies to penetrate the market, and Japan's high saving ratereduces its purchases of foreign goods.   Last year, Japan's trade surplus with the United States was $55billion, according to U.S. figures.   On other issues, Okamoto said, ``Mr. Kaifu will be making clearto the president that there will be no change whatsoever in ourbasic position in our foreign policy.''   In addition to forming a working relationship with U.S.officials, Kaifu plans to reach out to the American public, he said.   ``We expect Mr. Kaifu's personal traits _ young, energetic,accessible, a caring personality _ will be well received by ourAmerican friends,'' he said.   Kaifu's will visit Mexico Sept. 4-6. The newspaper YomiuriShimbun reported Monday that Kaifu will offer Mexican officials a $1billion loan to help combat air pollution in Mexico City.   Kaifu is to meet with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada inOttawa on Sept. 7, Okamoto said.</TEXT></DOC>
