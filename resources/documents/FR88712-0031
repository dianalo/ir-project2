On April 18, 1988, FmHA published a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 12695-12704) with a comment period endingMay 18, 1988. A correction to that proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 16615) on May 10, 1988. The purpose ofthis final rule is to amend Subpart B of Part 1900 to implement provisionsof the ``Agricultural Credit Act of 1987'' (Pub. L. 100-233) which establishesa national appeals ``staff.'' The Act establishes a national appeals staffto hear and review appeals of FmHA adverse decisions. Additionally, theAct requires appeal decisions involving farmer program loan restructuringto be made within 45 days of request for appeal and provide for submissionof an independent appraisal for appeals of farmer program restructuringdenials. The Act allows for an appeal review by the State Director and/orthe national Director of Appeals and requires a transcript of this appealhearing be made available to the appellant upon request.2. Although the appeal provisions of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987only affect CONACT applicants and borrowers, FmHA has administrativelychosen to provide these appeal rights for all FmHA applicants and borrowers,and for lenders and holders of loans guaranteed by FmHA, because FmHA believesthat review of adverse decisions by an independent staff will make it clearthat appellants' rights are fully protected in all cases. Section 534 ofthe Housing Act of 1949, as amended, provides that rules and regulationsaffecting housing programs must be published in final form for at least30 days <T3>unless</T3> the rule is published on an emergency basis. Due to thetime constraints imposed by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, and inaccordance with section 534(c) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended,there will be no waiting period between the date this final rule is publishedand the effective date of the regulation.3. On February 16, 1988, FmHA published a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 4414) with a comment period ending March17, 1988. The purpose of that proposed rule was to amend Subpart B of Part1900 to implement provisions of section 1313 of the Food Security Act of1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) pertaining to the Business and Industrial (B andamp;I) Loan Program. The intent of that proposed rule is to amend Subpart Bof Part 1900 to include appeals of B andamp; I loan decisions. That proposedrule also amends Subpart E of Part 1980 to reduce the frequency of financialstatements required on new businesses from monthly to quarterly for B andamp;I loans, reducing paperwork. All changes from this action are also madea part of this final rule.4. On September 30, 1986, FmHA published an interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 34926) with a comment period ending October30, 1986, regarding the Nonprofit National Corporations Loan and GrantProgram, 7 CFR Part 1980, Subpart G. On July 8, 1987, FmHA published anamendment to that same interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 25586-25589) with a comment period endingAugust 7, 1987. The final rules have not yet been promulgated. To ensureconsistency and fairness in the handling of FmHA appeals, an administrativedecision was made to include appeals of all loan and grant programs underSubpart B of Part 1900. Accordingly, only Part 1980, Subpart G, andSection;1980.680 is affected by this final rule as it relates to appeals. The restof both interim rules remains in effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>Forty-four comment letters were received. One respondent was a U.S. Congressman,6 were FmHA employees, 27 were legal aid groups, one was a State DeputyCommissioner of Agriculture, 3 were from religious groups and 6 respondentswere private citizens.Most respondents made extensive comments and their comments are addressedby section number.<T3>Section 1900.51. </T3>Three respondents felt the National Appeals Staffshould report directly to the Secretary of Agriculture to ensure impartialityand independence. The Act provides for a national appeals division withinFmHA and the Agency is in compliance with the law under the proposed organizationalstructure, which is administratively sound and provides for an efficientuse of existing resources. Five respondents claim that Internal RevenueService (IRS) offsets should cease. One respondent said that IRS offsetregulations are not in final form and should be included under this Subpart.As set forth in the proposed rule, the stated purpose of this rulemakingaction was to implement the requirements of the ``Agricultural Credit Actof 1987.'' The collection of IRS offsets by the Agency is an unrelatedissue and will not be discussed in this final rule. One respondent claimssuspension and debarment procedures for all loan and grant programs shouldbe handled in a special procedure. One respondent claims suspension anddebarment regulations are not in final form and should be included in thisprocedure. Again, these are issues unrelated to the stated intent of theproposed rule and are not discussed or implemented here. One respondentrequested clarification of Freedom of Information Act appeals, distinguishingbetween ``public'' and FmHA ``borrowers.'' Public requests for informationare handled as Freedom of Information requests, appealable under 7 CFRPart 1. Borrower requests for information from their case files are handledas Privacy Act Requests and are further clarified in section 1900(a)(2)of the subpart.Ten respondents claim the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) and the AdministrativeProcedure Act (APA) should be applicable to this subpart. One respondentclaimed no reference to these Acts should appear, as applicability is decidedby the courts.The rule will not be changed either to delete the references to the AdministrativeProcedure Act or to the Equal Access to Justice Act. While it is true that,in the ultimate sense, all questions of statutory construction are forthe courts, the case law is well settled with respect to both of theseissues. Section 554 of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Equal Accessto Justice Act apply only to formal adjudications conducted by administrativelaw judges (and, in the case of the Equal Access to Justice Act, to adjudicationsin which both the appellant and the agency are represented by counsel),not to informal appeals conducted by agency personnel as is set out inthe statutory provisions that these regulations implement. Deleting thestatement in the proposed rule would thus make the regulations less informativeto members of the public.Eight respondents objected to the statement that ``releases for certainfamily living and farm operating expenses will not be terminated untilthe borrower has received an opportunity for administrative appeal * **.'' The respondents claim FmHA does not have the authority to terminateany expenses. FmHA is amending this section to conform with the statutorylanguage requiring the release of essential family living and farm operatingexpenses.<T3>Section 1900.52. </T3>One respondent suggested that the definitionof appellant be expanded to include rural rental housing tenants when FmHAmakes a decision directly affecting an individual tenant. Individual tenantgrievance procedures are covered in Subpart L of Part 1944 of this chapter.The borrower may appeal this action under Subpart B of Part 1900 of thischapter. The Agency finds the existing procedures adequate and will notadopt this comment.One respondent suggested that a farmer applying for a guaranteed loan beallowed to request an appeal without the lender participating in the appeal.This is impractical since the lender is the real applicant for the guarantee,and any complaint on this subject therefore must be made by the lender.Therefore, the Agency will not adopt this suggestion.One respondent stated that hearings held under this subpart are not informalwhile another respondent suggested a definition of ``informal'' be written.These regulations set forth an administrative appeals procedure and arenot intended to be formal judicial proceedings. Also, defining what ``informal''means would have the opposite effect and add needless regulatory complications.The Agency will not adopt these suggestions.One respondent suggested that the definition of hearing officer be revisedto conform with the definition of review officer in regards to the authorityto uphold, modify or reverse decisions. The Agency will amend the regulationsto include this change.One respondent suggested a revision to the definition of ``directly andadversely affected'' to include all decisions regarding processing, servicingand collection of loans which have a direct effect on the appellant orthe appellant's property. The Agency believes the proposed definition issufficient and the suggested change could conflict with other Agency regulationsregarding the collection of debts.One respondent said that if an appellant's representative must be authorizedin writing, the appellant should be so informed. The Agency adopts thiscomment and Exhibit B-3 of this subpart is revised accordingly.<T3>Section 1900.53. </T3>One respondent suggested that copies of all documentationnecessary to initiate an adverse decision be provided to the appellantwhen notified of the adverse decision. Accessibility of information inthe appellant's case file is covered under andSection; 1900.56(a)(2) andis sufficient to afford the appellant the opportunity to prepare for theappeal hearing. The Agency will not adopt this comment.One respondent endorsed the need for the denial letter to include specificreasons for the adverse action and suggested further clarification withexamples. The Agency finds the present wording sufficient.One respondent wrote that appellants applying for assistance under theHousing Act of 1949 be given the rights to skip the informal meeting withthe decision maker and request a hearing directly. The suggestion makesa valid point and provides for more consistency in the regulations. TheAgency has adopted this comment and has amended the regulations accordingly.Seven respondents raised questions concerning the appeal of appraisalsand the State Director's role in review of the appraisal, requesting clarificationof this paragraph. The regulations have been amended to clarify this paragraph.Appeals for farmer program primary loan servicing are exempted from thisrequirement. The appeals process is suspended while this review is undertakenand the paragraph is revised to require appeal rights at the completionof the review. The State Director may opt not to review the appraisal andmay inform the appellant of their appeal rights at the outset of he/shechooses. A review of the appraisal by the State Director does not precludethe State Director from acting as a review officer in the appeal processon the same case, since the appellant may also choose the Director of Appealsto review the case.One appellant suggested that farmer program writedown request be changedto ``any primary loan servicing program.'' The Agency is in agreement andamends the regulations accordingly.One respondent suggested that multi-family housing appraisals be exemptfrom prior review by the State Director due to complexity and the costsinvested by the appellant at that point. The Agency believes that manyappraisal problems can be resolved by the method set out in the proposedrule without necessitating an appeal and, therefore, will not revise theparagraph as suggested.One respondent suggested that single family housing appraisals not be includedin this paragraph. The Agency believes for consistency and fairness thatall programs be included, and the comment is not adopted.Four respondents felt that an appellant should be given 15 days from thereceipt of the denial letter to request an appeal. Four respondents suggestedthat a 30-day response time was necessary. The Agency amends its finalrule to require a 30-day response time with an appellant's letter postmarkedon or before the 30th day.<T3>Section 1900.54. </T3>Two respondents suggested that appellants notbe required to travel more than 100 miles to a hearing site, or to thenearest FmHA office. While this comment has merit, the Agency does notforesee a problem in this area and is not aware of any in the past. Hearingswill be arranged at a mutually convenient time and place for all partiesinvolved. Since the decision maker and the appellant are typically in thesame geographic area, the hearing officer will do all that he or she canto arrange for a hearing site convenient to all. This is an operationalmatter of the National Appeals Staff and additional regulatory languageis unnecessary.Thirty-two respondents were opposed to telephone conference calls unlessspecifically requested by the appellant for the appellant's convenience.One respondent, while opposed to conference calls, recognized the needfor such in remote areas of Samoa, Guam, the Western Pacific areas andAlaska. The Agency amends its final rule to provide that conference callscannot be used against the wishes of the appellant. The Agency also amendsits final rule to retain language of the proposed rule concerning the useof conference calls for appeals in remote areas.One respondent requested a clarification that the area supervisor is amember of the National Appeals Staff. This is covered sufficiently in andSection;1900.54(a) and no further clarification is necessary.<T3>Section 1900.55. </T3>One respondent claims that all decisions areappealable and each appellant has the right to appeal and lose. Two respondentsclaim the National Appeals Staff should have the authority to overruledecisions based on regulations that do not meet applicable law. One respondentsuggests that an appellant be allowed to appeal if the underlying factsare in dispute. Another respondent suggested wording that if the groundsfor denial is fully dispositive, the decision is not appealable. The Agencyrecognizes that this is a sensitive issue and does not intend to delayor obstruct an appellant's rights. However, contrary to the respondent,the National Appeals Staff does not have the authority to overrule decisionsbased on regulations, even if they do not satisfy applicable law in theopinion of the hearing/review officer. Such interpretation is reservedfor the courts. Accordingly, the Agency will advise appellants that certaindecisions cannot be reversed in an appeal because they are based on clearand objective statutory or regulatory requirements. Appeals of these decisionsare unproductive for the appellant and FmHA. Exhibit C is used to informappellants of this decision. The exhibit letter does afford the appellantthe opportunity to request the National Appeals Staff to review the accuracyof the finding that the decision is not appealable. The Agency believesthis is sufficient to protect the appellant's rights in the event the underlyingfacts do not support the conclusion that the decision is unappealable.The suggested wording for Exhibit C is cumbersome and not readily understoodby the average appellant. The Agency finds Exhibit C sufficient as proposedin this matter.One respondent questioned the authority to deny a Section 514 grant toan applicant less than 62 years of age. This statutory mandate is set outin the annual appropriations act funding this program.One respondent requests further clarification of when an application isconsidered filed. Applications are considered filed when they are receivedin the FmHA office responsible for processing of the requests. Receivingand processing applications are covered in Subpart A of Part 1910 of thischapter and are not further discussed or clarified in this final rule.One respondent stated that a borrower with a non-program (NP) loan wouldlose all administrative appeal rights in a non-judicial foreclosure state,under this section. NP loans are not made pursuant to the Acts administeredby FmHA and the Agency is not required to extend program benefits to NPborrowers.Four respondents suggested that an appellant be given the right to appealthe use of an incorrect interest rate. The Agency is not aware that theuse of interest rates different from those published in FmHA Instructionsis a frequent problem. Agency procedures for processing and loan closingare designed to detect such an error before a loan is closed. However,the Agency has modified the final rule to allow an appeal if such an instanceoccurs.One respondent claims that denial of loan assistance because an appellanthas been convicted of planting, growing, cultivating, producing or harvestinga controlled substance, does not apply to those appellants seeking assistanceunder the Housing Act of 1949. Section 1764 of the Food Security Act of1985 provides for denial of assistance when convicted of the aforementionedfor all applicants seeking assistance under the Consolidated Farm and RuralDevelopment Act and any other provision of law administered by FmHA. TheAgency will not adopt this suggestion.One respondent suggested a clarification to include chattel appraisals.The Agency amends the final rule accordingly.One respondent questioned if the use of ``reversible'' and ``non-reversible''equated to ``appealable'' and ``non-appealable''. The Agency amends thefinal rule of this section to use the terms ``appealable'' and ``non-appealable''consistently.Eleven respondents commented that hearing officers should be able to overturnin appeal an unfavorable recommendation by the County Committee on a debtsettlement offer. The agency amends its final rule to adopt this suggestion.A decision by the hearing officer to overrule the County Committee willnot constitute approval of the debt settlement offer, and does not precludea later denial of the offer by the approval official or subsequent appealrights as a result of that denial.Ten respondents suggested that denial of assistance because of confirmedincome should be appealable, since the term ``confirmed income'' couldbe open to degrees of interpretation. Since confirmed income is that incomeagreed to by the appellant and the employer, the Agency sees no need toexempt this type of decision. As discussed earlier, the use of ExhibitC to inform the appellant of the denial affords the opportunity to requestfurther interpretation.<T3>Section 1900.56. </T3>Ten respondents suggested that a delay of anappeal should be based on whether the reasons for delay were beyond thecontrol of the appellant. The Agency adopts this comment and revises thefinal rule accordingly.Twelve respondents stated that the availability of information from thecase file should not exempt cases of real estate acceleration. This wasthe result of an error in the proposed rule and the Agency amends its finalrule to remove the exception.Four respondents stated that more than 10 days is necessary to review thecase file, with one respondent suggesting unlimited access to the casefile. One respondent suggested the case file remain with the decision maker.The intent of the Agency is not to deny access to the case file, but tosolve a logistical problem of allowing file access to the appellant, yetstill provide the file to the hearing officer in time to prepare for thehearing. This paragraph has been clarified to address the concerns of therespondents.Nine respondents made further comments under this section suggesting a150 mile limit for hearings. These issues were discussed previously andthe Agency will not adopt the comments. One respondent suggested a definitetime frame to schedule a hearing. The Agency does not wish to remove theflexibility of hearing officers in scheduling hearings. This is an operationalissue and will not be the subject of a rule unless experience suggestsa need for a regulatory standard.One respondent stated that since the Area Supervisor could grant exceptionsto appeal request deadlines, the regulations should specify how an appellantmay request an exception. One respondent requested verification on howa continuance may be granted. The Agency does not wish to overburden theseregulations with formalized procedures for every specific circumstancethat may arise. The Agency believes the regulations presently provide enoughguidance to appellants without restricting flexibility to National AppealStaff officials to grant extensions for good reasons without further regulatorylanguage.One respondent suggested that the regulation be amended to specificallyprohibit FmHA officials from destroying material in the case file. Theproposed language already prohibits destruction of case file material andno further clarification is necessary. One respondent requested a writtenwaiver form be developed so an appellant could waive a hearing. The Agencybelieves this is unnecessary and the appellant's request for waiver aspart of their written request for appeal is sufficient.Fourteen respondents commented on the submission of new reasons for denialafter the initial decision has been made. The responses ranged from submissionof new reasons only if the appellant has adequate time for preparationand rebuttal to no new submissions in any case. The Agency partially amendsand clarifies the final rule to allow the hearing officer some discretionin these cases as to how to proceed.<T3>Section 1900.57. </T3>One respondent claimed that placing the burdenof proof on the appellant is a violation of the Administrative ProcedureAct (APA). One respondent stated that FmHA should bear the burden of proofin real estate foreclosure cases. In all appellate review systems, whetherinformal administrative appeals, or before administrative law judges, orconducted by judges in the Federal or State courts, the person who appealsa decision has the burden of explaining why the decision appealed fromis incorrect, and this provision of the regulation was designed to makethis fact clear to applicants and borrowers using these rules. While ``burdenof proof'', it is true, can be distinguished legally from the ``burdenof persuasion'', or the ``burden of presenting evidence'', depending onthe facts and legal issues presented by a particular case, it would becounterproductive to use arcane terms and hence to make these rules socomplex that they would be confusing to some of those who will use them.The term ``burden of proof'' is well known, and will convey to appellantstheir responsibility to open the hearing with an explanation to the hearingofficer of why they think they should have been given the relief they weredenied by the decisional officer. The proposed language therefore willbe retained in the final rule, for all type of appeals.One respondent suggested that the appellant should be able to prove whya decision should be modified as well as reversed. The Agency adopts thiscomment in the final rule.One respondent suggested the appellant be given the right to request ahearing to be held open for 15 days to submit new information. Anotherrespondent suggested new information could be submitted at any time. TheAgency believes the proposed language regarding a continuance is sufficientand flexible enough to give the hearing officer sufficient flexibilityto meet the needs of appellants.One respondent suggested that information from unidentified third partiesshould not be admissible in the hearing. While the agency agrees that theuse of evidence from unidentified third parties should usually be entitledto little or no weight, the regulations will not be amended to providefor a blanket exclusion of all information that could be so categorized.The hearing officer should have the discretion to decide when evidencelacks reliability, and the agency sees no need to provide for a blanketprohibition directed against any particular kind of evidence in these informalproceedings.Two respondents requested written notice in advance of all FmHA witnessesto be present. Two respondents claimed that all FmHA witnesses should alwaysbe made available. Four respondents said information presented by witnessesshould be limited to denial issues only. One respondent said that non-governmentwitnesses should be compensated for their time. One respondent claimeda necessity to subpoena reluctant witnesses, and one respondent said thehearing officer had too much discretion.The Agency has stated that this administrative appeals process is informalin nature and does not wish to overjudicialize the process with regulationsconcerning the admissibility of evidence and use of witnesses. The intentis to give the hearing officer enough flexibility to determine what informationis needed to reach a conclusion of the matter. FmHA employees will be madeavailable whenever possible and the Agency is committed to cooperate withthe appellant in this regard. However, scheduling, travel and other expensesmay preclude FmHA witnesses being available at a hearing. Furthermore,the Agency is not empowered to subpoena witnesses or to compensate themfor their time. The Agency does agree that information by witnesses shouldbe limited to denial issues only and the final rule is amended to incorporatethis suggestion.Four respondents stated that the decision maker should always be an FmHAofficial. One respondent said an appointed delegate must be an FmHA officialand one respondent stated that FmHA officials should not represent theCounty Committee as decision maker at hearings. The Agency is not awareof any instances where a decision maker or delegate would not be an FmHAofficial and believes no further clarification is necessary. County Committeemembers are not full-time FmHA employees and mandatory attendance at hearingswould be difficult and unnecessary. The appellant may request a meetingwith the County Committee prior to the hearing.Five respondents suggested the hearing be tape recorded in all instances.One respondent suggested the appellant pay for a copy of the tape. Onerespondent claimed hearing tapes should be available to the public. Thecost of duplicating the tape is nominal and the Agency will not chargefor the tape. The hearing tape is part of the appeal record and the appellant'scase file and, therefore, protected under the Privacy Act. The Agency amendsits final rule to require a tape recording of all hearings.Twenty-eight respondents stated that the Act requires a transcript be preparedfor all appeals and the cost of a transcript to the appellant should belimited to the cost of reproduction only. The Agency's interpretation ofthe Act is that a transcript will be provided to the appellant upon request.No transcript is required if the appellant does not request one. In fiscalyear 1987 only 20 percent of the appeal requests resulted in a furtherrequest for appeal review. The Agency expects, under the new appeal procedures,that more appeals will be resolved at the hearing level. It is reasonableto project that 20 percent of future appeal hearings may result in a requestfor further review by the State Director or Director, National AppealsStaff. If the Agency chose to order transcripts in all cases it would resultin a delay of all appeal decisions while transcripts were being prepared.In addition, there would be an unnecessary cost to the taxpayer since atranscript is only useful in those cases where an appellant seeks furtherreview. Appellants who have had an adverse decision reversed in appealhave no need for a transcript, yet the decision to reverse the adverseaction would be delayed until the transcript was prepared and made partof the record.The Agency will provide all appellants with a free copy of the hearingtape. In most cases the tape will be sufficient for an appellant to decideif an appeal review is needed. The Agency will provide the appellant atranscript of the hearing upon request as required by the Act, but willnot arrange for a transcript unless there is a request.One respondent suggested arrangements be made for hearing and sight impairedappellants. The Agency adopts this comment in the final rule. One respondent requested information on how to request a copy of the hearingrecord. This information is provided in the decision letter from the hearingand/or review officer and can also be requested by the appellant at thehearing itself.One respondent suggested clarification on what constitutes good cause fora continuance. The Agency believes the proposed rule language is sufficientlyflexible to allow the hearing officer discretion on this issue and furtherclarification would become, instead, too restrictive.One respondent stated that the regulations should define the hearing officer'sgeneral knowledge of FmHA programs. Another respondent suggested the hearingofficer state background, experience and general knowledge at the outsetof the hearing. The Agency believes these suggestions are unnecessary andrun contrary to the intent that these appeal proceedings are informal innature. One respondent suggested an appellant be given no less than seven daysto review additional information. One respondent suggested the appellantbe given copies of additional information. The Agency finds the presentwording sufficient for time to review the information (no more than 15days) and the right to review additional information already exists inthe proposed rule language. One respondent stated that appeal decisions on housing and farmer programsshould both be rendered within 45 days. One respondent suggested a hearingin 30 days and a decision in 45 days. While the Agency desires to renderappeal decisions in the shortest time possible, the logistics of traveland scheduling for all parties involved will always be an obstacle to thisend. Delays in scheduling an appeal hearing are as often a result of anappellant's time conflicts, as they are with FmHA. Accordingly, the Agencydoes not wish to impose an arbitrary deadline for an appeal decision exceptfor appeals involving primary loan servicing programs as required by theAct. The Agency will not adopt these suggestions.Three respondents requested that Guide Letter 1900-B-1 be published forcomment. Since this is a guide letter and may require an individual alterationwith each appeal decision reached, it is not published as part of thisregulation. Guide Letter 1900-B-1 will be available in any FmHA officeupon publication of this final rule.One respondent stated that all reasons for denial be stated in the denialletter and no new reasons are admissible. The proposed rule language alreadyrequires all reasons for denial be listed and the submission of new reasonshas already been addressed in this final rule.Seven respondents suggested that the list of appraisers for appeals involvingprimary loan servicing of farmer program loans be limited to individualswho have not worked for FmHA in the past. One respondent suggested theindependent appraisal be used as the new basis for valuation. Five respondentssuggested a minimum of three appraisers but allow as many as available.One respondent asked how the appraisers would be selected. One respondentsuggested the appellant be notified of the appraisal right in the denialletter.The Agency will promulgate regulations similar to those found in andSection;1980.113 (d)(9)(c)(ii) of Subpart B of Part 1980 of this chapter to determinethe appraisers used. The Agency believes that in some areas it would beimpractical to limit appraisers to those who have not worked for FmHA inthe past. The Agency does amend its final rule to require a minimum of3 appraisers and to notify appellants of their appraisal rights. The Actdoes not require the new appraisal to become the basis of valuation, butonly that it be considered in the appeal decision.<T3>Section 1900.58. </T3>Five respondents suggested all review decisionsbe rendered in 45 days. As previously discussed, the Agency desires thatall appeal decisions will be rendered as soon as possible but will notarbitrarily set deadlines not imposed by law since exceptions will occur.Three respondents recommended that an appeal review by the State Directoris unnecessary and should be eliminated. This requirement is statutoryand not within the discretion of the Agency to change.<T3>Section 1900.59.</T3> Eight respondents suggested that all dates anddeadlines should be put on hold pending the outcome of an appeal. The Agencybelieves the only deadline of consequence here relates to an accelerationnotice and the final rule is amended to suspend foreclosure action untilan appeal is resolved. One respondent suggested language to cover caseswhere statutory or case law has changed while the appeal is in process.The final rule is amended to use regulations in effect at the time theinitial adverse decision was taken.Two respondents suggested that rural housing loan application processingbe resumed within 15 days after a decision is overturned on appeal. Thisapplies to loans made under the Consolidated Farm and Rural DevelopmentAct (7 U.S.C.) only as amended, as required by section 1312 of the FoodSecurity Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198).Three respondents suggested the word ``loan'' be substituted for applicationin this section. The Agency does not adopt this comment since a reversalof an unfavorable eligibility determination does not necessarily mean aloan is approved. An application may be denied by a loan approval officialafter further processing.Four respondents suggested the regulations address recordkeeping requirementsand accessibility of those records to the public. Recordkeeping requirementson appeals will become the responsibility of the National Appeals Staffand an automated system of tracking appeal workload is under development.This is an administrative function of the NAS and not necessary to addressin this rule. Accessibility of records is covered under Freedom of Informationrequest in FmHA Instruction 2018-F (available in any FmHA office).Four respondents, all FmHA employees, suggested amendments to allow a decisionmaker to appeal a hearing officer's decision to over rule or modify a denialof assistance. The Agency will address this issue as a separate proposedrule at a later date.<T3>Exhibit A</T3>_Six respondents suggested that no government attorneybe allowed at a hearing to question the appellant or witnesses. The presenceof government attorneys at appeal hearings is extremely rare and the Agencyhas no reason to believe this situation will change. However, circumstancesmay arise in a complex appeal case where the Agency may wish legal counselto be present as a resource. The Agency does not wish to preclude thisoption and will not adopt the comment.Four respondents claimed that hearings should not be conducted in FmHAoffices or adjoining offices. One respondent requested the physical comfortof the hearing room be considered. One respondent suggested each Statehave designated areas for hearings. One respondent suggested that an appellantcould also arrange a hearing location. The scheduling of hearing locationsis an administrative function of the hearing officer and it is not theintent of this rule to provide operational regulations. The hearing officerneeds flexibility in scheduling hearings and it is impractical to set outrestrictions for hearing locations.Situations may arise where an FmHA office is the only area available convenientto all parties, particularly in rural areas. The proposed language thatthe hearing officer will attempt to hold a hearing in a neutral place issufficient and allows necessary flexibility.One respondent suggest wording that the hearing officer will not fraternizewith the decision maker. This comment is adopted in the final rule. Onerespondent suggested that contact between the hearing officer and the decisionmaker be limited to scheduling only. The Agency believes this is unnecessarilyrestrictive and will not adopt the comment. One respondent suggested ahearing officer may postpone a hearing as well as terminate it, if an appellantbecomes unruly. Another respondent questions if a terminated hearing resultsin forfeited appeal rights. The Agency does not foresee termination ofa hearing as a common occurance. Instances of severe disruption of a hearingare possible, however, and it will be at the discretion of the hearingofficer to reschedule the hearing or notify the appellant that appeal rightshave been forfeited.One respondent stated that the decision maker inform all parties of thereason for denial. One respondent suggested clarification that furtherreview rights are to the State Director and/or Director, National AppealsStaff. Again, this rule does not set out complete operational procedurefor the NAS and the Agency believes further clarification is unnecessary.Further appeal rights will be discussed at the hearing as well as reasonsfor denial.One respondent claimed that the phrase ``unduly setting the tone'' is vague,could be abused by the hearing officer, and should be removed. The Agencybelieves the hearing officer must control the hearing to limit discussionto relevant issues only. Frequently hearings have taken considerable timediscussing unrelated issues surfaced by both the appellant and the decisionmaker. Other hearings have become too formalized with swearing in of witnesses,submission of exhibits testimony, etc. The Agency retains the languagein the final rule as necessary for the hearing officer to perform his/herduties.<T3>Exhibits B-1, B-2, B-3, B-5. </T3>One respondent stated that theseexhibits should inform the appellant of all available farmer program loanservicing and debt restructuring options as well as a business reply cardto respond. The intent of this rule and these exhibits is to inform theappellant of appeal rights after denial of assistance. The availabilityof and notice of loan servicing options were addressed in a separate proposedrule on May 23, 1988, set out in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at Vol. 53, No. 99, pages 18392-18523. Three respondents suggested clarification or changes on the number of daysto report a meeting and/or appeal. The Agency has amended these exhibitsto conform with other changes and to address these concerns. Exhibit B-1,B-2, B-3 and B-5 have been consolidated and revised into just two exhibits.Exhibit B-1 advises appellants of the adverse decision and the right toa meeting and/or a hearing. Exhibit B-2 notifies appellants of the resultsof the meeting and also of their further appeal rights. Both exhibits andExhibit B-4 are revised to require an appeal request be postmarked within30 days. The exhibits are also revised to specify the actual date of postmark andto allow an appellant to write as well as call the decision maker, as requestedby two respondents. <T3>Exhibit B-4. </T3>One respondent suggested items in the case file thatare considered confidential should be identified in this Exhibit. The Agencydoes not adopt this comment and refers to the discussion of section 1900(a)(2)of this rule for access to the case file material. <T3>Exhibit C. </T3>Two respondents suggested revised language to thisexhibit as part of their comments under andSection; 1900.55 of this rule.The Agency will not adopt these comments for the reasons set out in thediscussion of that section as a part of this rule. One respondent suggestedthe appellant be informed that if a decision of denial is based on non-appealableand appealable reasons and the appealable reasons are used in a separatedenial action, they may be appealed at that time. The Agency believes thisis unnecessary since the appellant would be informed of their appeal rightsat the time of the subsequent denial action. One respondent stated that non-appealable decisions could only be basedon those specific reasons set out in andSection; 1900.55. The Agency didnot intend for this section to be an all inclusive list and will not adoptthis comment. <T3>Exhibit D. </T3>One respondent stated that copies of recommended decisionsbeing transmitted internally from a designated hearing/review officer tothe National Director of Appeals should be provided to the appellant. TheAgency's intent is that a designee will recommend a decision based on theirreview of the case. The recommendation serves only as a basis for discussionas an internal document and it would not be appropriate to send it to theappellant. One respondent stated that Note 4 was unclear and implied a different appealprocess for non-farmer program appellants. The Agency amends the finalrule to delete Note 4 as well as Note 6 since both are no longer relevant.<T3>General Comments. </T3>Three respondents requested the Agency not delaythe inclusion of rural housing appeals in this procedure. One respondentsuggested the NAS only conduct appeals for farmer programs and single familyhousing. One respondent suggested the Agency delay implementation of allbut farmer program appeals. The Agency has determined that all appealsof adverse actions will be handled by NAS beginning on the effective dateof this final rule. One respondent said that a 30 day comment period was insufficient timeto comment on the issues relating to housing programs. The 30 day commentperiod was discussed and authorized in the proposed rule, pursuant to 42U.S.C. 1480. One respondent stated that hearing/review officers not be assigned to caseswhere they have worked for the past two years. The Agency will implementthis to the extent practical but does not recognize a need to address thisissue in the final rule. One respondent suggested that hearings involving multifamily housing latefee waivers be conducted entirely in writing. The Agency finds this suggestioninequitable and impractical and will not adopt in the final rule. Fourrespondents stated that all hearing officers be thoroughly trained andthat training agenda be published for comment. While the Agency recognizesthe need and statutory requirement for training, it is an operational issueand not needed as a part of this final rule. One respondent stated thata list of reimbursable administrative expenses for NAS be published forcomment. The Agency sees no need to publish for comment the internal budgetaryexpenditures and accounting methods of the NAS. One respondent said thefinal rule should contain a statement that the Secretary will commit adequateresources to NAS to insure a timely appeals process. The Agency believesthis responsibility is implied in the Act and inherent duties of the Secretary.Publication of such a statement in this rule adds no more authority orvalidity to this responsibility. Section 1980.680 of Subpart G of Part 1980. One respondent suggested thissection be revised so that any adversed decision may be appealed by theNational Nonprofit Corporation (NNC) or the lender. Applicants for assistance under the Nonprofit Corporations loan and grantprogram and borrowers and lenders under the program may appeal certainFmHA decisions. Appeal rights are not extended beyond those entities toothers, such as ultimate recipients under the program. Those entities haveno direct relationship with FmHA under the program and FmHA decisions donot directly affect these entities. The Agency adopts this comment in thefinal rule. The Agency received no comments on the proposed rule change for SubpartA, part 1980 and Subpart E, Part 1980. <T3>Discussion of Changes. </T3>Upon further review of the AgriculturalCredit Act of 1987 (Act), a change was made that differs from the proposedrule. Section 615 of the Act requires FmHA to give borrowers 45 days topurchase the security property at net recovery value, after receipt ofnotification of ineligibility for primary servicing actions. The finalrule is amended to require the hearing/review officer to send the decisionletter, certified mail, return receipt requested, to the initial decisonmaker in those cases. On June 18, 1987 the Agency suspended all appeal conferences, hearingsand reviews for borrowers who were sent forms FmHA 1924-25 ``Notice ofIntent to Take Adverse Action'' and Form FmHA 1924-26 ``Borrower Acknowledgementof Notice of Intent to Take Adverse Action''. This action was taken asa result of pending litigation in <T3>Coleman vs. Block</T3>. Those appeals and appeal requests that weresuspended by this action are superseded by new servicing procedures requiredby the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. Therefore, all hearing requestsand hearing procedures then in process that were suspended by that actionare hereby terminated. Section 1980.67 of Subpart A of Part 1980 is also revised with minor editorialand punctuation changes. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG><T3>7 CFR Part 1900 </T3>Appeals, Credit, Loan programs_Housing and Community Development. <T3>7 CFR Part 1980 </T3>Loan programs_Business and Industry-rural development assistance, ruralareas-Nonprofit Corporates, Grant programs-Nonprofit Corporations Therefore, Chapter XVIII, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations is amendedas follows: <ITAG tagnum="52"><T2>PART 1900_GENERAL </T2></ITAG>1.

It also sets out the authorityand procedures of the National Appeals Staff, which gives administrativeappeals and further review of these decisions. The National Appeals Staffis an organization within FmHA which is independent from FmHA State andlocal officials, and from all other agency officials making program administrativedecisions. The FmHA official heading the National Appeals Staff, the Directorof Appeals, reports directly to the Administrator of FmHA. (b) The provisions of this subpart apply to program administrative decisionsconcerning all loans and grants made by FmHA. These include farmer programloans, housing loans (both single- and multi-family), community and businessprogram loans, and all grant programs administered by FmHA. (c) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to any decisions made byFmHA other than those referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, norto decisions made by organizations outside FmHA even when those decisionsare used as a basis for decisions falling within paragraph (b) of thissection. Examples of the first kind of decision are Freedom of InformationAct decisions to release or deny the release of information sought by membersof the public (appealable under 7 CFR Part 1), decisions to purchase ornot to purchase goods and services from members of the public under theFederal contracting laws and regulations (which decisions are appealableto the Department's Board of Contract Appeals under 7 CFR Part 24), FmHAmulti-family housing tenant appeals covered by the appeals provisions of7 CFR Part 1944, suspension and debarment disputes falling within the scopeof 7 CFR Part 1944 and offsets against tax refunds. Examples of the secondkind of decision are decisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporationconcerning claimed crop losses (which may determine whether the producerof the crop can or cannot qualify for an FmHA Emergency loan), decisionsof the Soil Conservation Service on whether particular farmland is or isnot ``highly erodible'' (which may determine whether an applicant is eligiblefor participation in FmHA loan programs), and decisions by State governmentalconstruction standards-setting agencies (which may determine whether FmHAwill finance certain houses). (d) The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551-559,as amended, are not applicable to proceedings under this subpart exceptfor the requirements concerning public information. The Equal Access toJustice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504, as amended, does not apply to these proceedings.(e) Assistance will not be discontinued pending the outcome of an administrativeappeal of a complete or partial adverse action. For borrowers with farmerprogram loans, as defined in andSection;1900.52(d) of this subpart, releasesfor essential family living and farm operating expenses will not be terminateduntil the borrower has received an opportunity for administrative appealand, if the borrower elects such an appeal, until the appeal and any furtherreview is complete. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1900.52 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Appellant</T3> means an applicant for FmHA assistance or an FmHA borrowerholder (only as to decisions involving the repurchase of the holder's interest),or grantee, either individual or organizational, that is directly and adverselyaffected by an administrative decision by FmHA. The appellant may alsobe an applicant for or a recipient of a loan guarantee. (b) <T3>Hearing,</T3> as used in this subpart, is an informal proceeding atwhich an administrative appeal from an adverse decision is heard. (c) <T3>Decision maker</T3> is the FmHA official who actually makes the specificdecision but not the official who serves in an advisory capacity in interpretinginstructions, policies, or technical items, or who performs routine supervision.For example, if an FmHA official reviews a preapplication from an organizationand directs a subordinate to include specific items in Form AD-622, ``Noticeof Preapplication Review Action,'' the official is the decision maker.However, when the official or designee serves only in an advisory capacityand is not significantly involved in the decision, the subordinate willbe considered the decision maker. (d) <T3>Farm program loans</T3> means Farm Ownership (FO), Operating (OL),Soil and Water (SW), Recreation (RL), Emergency (EM), Economic Emergency(EE), Individual Economic Opportunity (EO), Special Livestock (SL), SoftwoodTimber (ST) loans and/or Rural housing loans for farms service buildings(RHF). (e) <T3>Hearing officer</T3> is the member of the National Appeals Staff whoconducts the administrative appeal hearing and has the authority to uphold,reverse or modify the decisions of the decision maker. See Exhibit D ofthis subpart for the designations of hearing officers. (f) <T3>Review officer</T3> is the member of the National Appeals Staff whohas the authority to uphold, reverse, or modify decisions of the hearingofficer. See Exhibit D of this subpart for the designations of review officers.(g) <T3>Record</T3> means the FmHA file, papers filed by an appellant, tapes,written version of the transcript (if any) of a hearing, and decisionsmade by FmHA. (h) <T3>Official positions.</T3> The terms County Supervisor and District Directormay vary in a few geographical areas. These terms will also mean AssistantArea Loan Specialist and Area Loan Specialist, respectively. (i) <T3>``Directly and adversely affected''</T3> means having a request forFmHA assistance denied in whole or in part or having FmHA assistance reduced,cancelled, or not renewed. (j) <T3>``Representative''</T3> means an attorney or other person authorizedin writing by an appellant to act for that person in an administrativeappeal. Representatives will be presumed to retain their authority to actfor an appellant until the written authorization is revoked in writing.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1900.53 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Adverse action procedures. </ITAG>(a) The following actions must take place before adverse program administrativedecisions are made. These steps are the responsibility of FmHA programdecision makers. (1) All documentation and calculations necessary to the determination toinitiate an adverse action must be accurate, complete, and included withinthe administrative file. (2) The specific reason or reasons for an intended adverse action shouldbe clearly explained to the applicant or borrower. Vague reasons shouldbe avoided. For example, avoid ``you lack repayment ability.'' Calculationsand documentation which demonstrate the lack of repayment will be providedand explained to the borrower or applicant. (3) All appellants are entitled to an opportunity for a separate informalmeeting with a decision maker before the appeal process is begun. The decisionmaker must give the applicant or borrower notice of his or her right tothis meeting at a time no later than 10 days after the decision to denythe application or to accelerate a borrower's loan or loans or otherwiseto terminate assistance. (4) When the person or organization officials attend a meeting with thedecision maker and the meeting results in a resolution of the matter, theofficial will send the person or organization a letter within 7 calendardays of the meeting, setting forth the conclusions reached. If the meetingdoes not result in a resolution of the matter, Exhibit B-2 with attachmentExhibit B-3 of this subpart will be sent within 7 calendar days of themeeting to notify the person or organization of their rights to an administrativeappeal. If an applicant or borrower who requests a meeting fails to agreeto a time and place or to attend, the appellant is still entitled to ahearing. (b) When an applicant or borrower wishes to contest an appraisal of propertyvalue (except for appraisals made in connection with farmer program loanwrite-down requests), the applicant must be advised that he or she mustrequest review of the appraisal by the State Director of FmHA before theappeal. If an applicant or borrower seeks such a review, the time for seekingadministrative review will be extended until after the State Director hasacted on the request. The State Director will review each such requestand, when in his or her sole discretion it is deemed appropriate, may senda representative to make an on-site review. If this does not result ina resolution of the matter, Exhibit B-2 with attachment B-3 of this subpartwill be sent to the appellant to notify them of their appeal rights. Appraisalsinvolving farmer program primary loan servicing may be appealed directlyto the Area Supervisor, National Appeals Staff without prior review bythe State Director. The appellant bears the burden of showing why the appraisalis in error. The appellant may submit an independent appraisal, at theircost, from a qualified appraiser, who is a designated member of a Nationalappraisal society or organization. The appraisal must conform to Agencyappraisal regulations applicable to the loan program. If the two appraisalvalues vary by no more than five percent, the FmHA appraisal will be consideredas the basis of valuation.(c) If an applicant, guaranteed lender, a holder, borrower or grantee isdirectly and adversely affected by a decision covered by this subpart,the decision maker will inform that person or organization by letter ofthe decision within 10 calendar days of the decision.(1) Letters, as indicated in Exhibits B-1 and B-2, and Exhibit C of thissubpart, as appropriate, will be used to notify the applicant, borroweror grantee. The notice will advise how to request an administrative appealand to obtain the record. All such letters shall contain the statement:``The request for an administrative appeal must be sent to the NationalAppeals Staff, Area Supervisor, (show complete mailing address), no laterthan (give date 30 days after the date of mailing the letter). Requestswhich are postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service on or before that datewill be considered as timely received.''(2) When a program administrative decision is required by a clear and objectivestatutory or regulatory reason listed in andSection; 1900.55 of this subpartas being non-appealable, the decision maker will notify the applicant orborrower of such reason and that the decision is not appealable by noticeto the applicant or borrower given with Exhibit C of this subpart.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1900.54</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">National Appeals Staff.</ITAG>(a) The National Appeals Staff consists of a Director of Appeals, AreaSupervisors, Hearing Officers, Review Officers, and such other subordinateofficers as may from time to time be necessary to hear and determine administrativeappeals from decisions made appealable under this subpart.(b) Appeal hearings will ordinarily be face-to-face hearings, held in theState of the appellant's residence, except in the following circumstances.(1) With the consent of the appellant, hearings may be held in a placeoutside his or her State of residence when more convenient to the appellant,the hearing officer and the program officials who must attend the hearing.(2) Appeals originating in Samoa, Guam, remote areas of Alaska, and theWestern Pacific areas may be acted upon without a hearing when, in thediscretion of the Area Supervisor, travel time and expense make such ahearing impracticable. In such cases, the Hearing Officer will allow areasonable period of time for the appellant to examine or obtain copiesof relevant documents and will make such other arrangements as are necessaryto determine the appeal expeditiously and fairly. A telephone conferencecall may also be used as set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.(3) At the request of the appellant, the Hearing Officer, or the programofficials who must appear at a hearing, the Area Supervisor may authorizeuse of a telephone conference call or calls to conduct a hearing. The AreaSupervisor will solicit and consider the views of all parties before usingthis authority, and will not use it when any party other than the appellantshows that a face-to-face hearing is necessary to resolve issues of credibilityor for other good reasons, or when the appellant, for any reason, prefersa face-to-face hearing.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1900.55</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Appealable and non-appealable decisions.</ITAG>(a) Program administrative decisions of the Farmers Home Administrationthat directly and adversely affect a person are appealable by that personto the National Appeals Staff under the provisions of this Subpart. Allmatters concerning the application of the law and applicable regulationsto the facts of the matter may be considered. The National Appeals Staffand its officers do not, however, have the authority to change or waiveapplicable laws or regulations. Program administrative decisions basedon such clear and objective statutory or regulatory requirements are thereforenot appealable. Exhibit C of this subpart will be used in these cases.Examples include:(1) Denial of a Section 504 grant to an applicant less than 62 years ofage.(2) Denial of a loan and/or grant to an individual or organization in anineligible area.(3) Denial of a loan and/or grant to a type of organization not identifiedas an eligible applicant by the regulations.(4) Denial of a loan because an application for an Emergency loan was notfiled before a prescribed termination date.(5) Denial of loan because of confirmed income that is above FmHA publishedlimits.(6) Interest credit reduction that is the result of a confirmed incomeincrease.(7) A determination of ineligibility for Emergency loans based on confirmationor verification by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service(ASCS) or the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) that the applicantdid not have the required production losses of 30 percent or more.(8) Denial of compensation for construction defects when it has been determinedthat the contractor is willing and able to correct the deficiencies.(9) Requirements and conditions designated by law to be developed by agenciesother than FmHA. They include, but are not limited to: Davis-Bacon wagerates; flood plain determination; archaeological and historical areas preservationrequirements, and designation of areas that have been determined to beinhabited by endangered species.(10) Applicable State development standards for construction and otherdevelopment. An appeal may only be made when the appellant claims FmHAis misapplying the written standards.(11) Interest rates as set forth in FmHA procedure, except denial of limitedresource rates, or an application of an incorrect interest rate.(12) A rent increase rejection when the borrower fails or refused to applyfor rental assistance according to Exhibit C of Subpart C of Part 1930of this chapter.(13) Decisions involving non-program loans.(14) Denial of assistance (including a subordination request or transferand assumption) because of a conviction under Federal or State law of planting,cultivating, growing, producing, harvesting, or storing a controlled substance.``Controlled substance'' is defined in Exhibit C of Subpart A of Part 1941of this chapter (available in any FmHA office).(b) Appraisals of property value including chattels, may be appealed throughthe hearing and review process provided for in this subpart only afterreview by the State Director as provided in andSection; 1900.53(b) of thissubpart. Appraisals involving farmer program primary loan servicing maybe appealed without prior review by the State Director.(c) In cases where denial of assistance is based upon both appealable andnonappealable actions, the denial of assistance is not appealable. ExhibitC of this subpart will be used in these cases and will include all reasonsfor the decision.(d) Appeals from applicants for, or borrowers, of, Farmer Programs loansor loans to Indian Tribes and Tribal Corporations who are denied assistancebased on reasons relating to highly erodible land, wetland, or convertedwetland (see Exhibit M of Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter for applicableFMHA requirements) will be handled as follows: Appeals questioning eitherthe presence of a wetland, converted wetland, or highly erodible land ona particular property or application to a property of the exemptions identifiedin paragraph 11 b and c of Exhibit M of Subpart G of Part 1940 of thischapter must be filed directly with the USDA Agency making the determinationin accordance with its administrative appeal procedures. If the denialof assistance involves an adverse decision based on determinations madeboth by FmHA and another USDA Agency, the appeal will be handled by bothagencies in two separate appeals which as much as possible should be handledconcurrently. See andSection; 12.12 of Subpart A of Part 12 of Subtitle A(Attachment 1 of Exhibit M of Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter whichis available in any FMHA office).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1900.56 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Appeal requests.</ITAG>(a) When an applicant appeals a decision and requests a hearing, the appealwill be handled as follows:(1) Upon receipt of the request, the Area Supervisor, National AppealsStaff will verify whether the appeal was submitted within the authorizedperiod. If the appeal was not submitted within the authorized time period,appeal rights are terminated unless the delay of the appeal was beyondthe appellant's control or for other good reasons as determined by theArea Supervisor.(2) The appellant's case file will be made available to the appellant orhis representative at the FmHA decision maker's office for 10 working daysfollowing the receipt of a request for appeal. If the appellant has madea request to inspect or to receive copies of FmHA material concerning thecase, the material will be made available to the appellant or the appellant'srepresentative at the FmHA decision maker's office as soon as possible,but no later than 10 working days following the receipt of the requestfor the material. A written request from the appellant will not be required.Requests for information of a confidential nature exempt from disclosureunder andSection; 2015.204 of FmHA Instruction 2015-E, (available in anyFmHA office), will be handled in accordance with that instruction. An FmHAemployee will insure that no material is destroyed or removed from thefile.(3) If, upon review of the file, the hearing officer determines that thedecision will be reversed, he or she will notify all parties of the determinationand of the actions to be taken. Otherwise, the hearing officer will arrangefor a hearing to be held as soon as possible, but normally within 45 calendardays of the receipt of the request for a hearing.(4) An appeal hearing as a result of a denial of a borrower's request forrelease of normal income security must be held within 20 days of such requestunless the borrower agrees to a longer time.(5) The hearing will be held at a location convenient to the appellant,decision maker and hearing officer. The hearing must be held in the stateof residence of the appellant unless the appellant agrees to another location.If no place can be agreed on, the hearing officer will select the locationwithin the appellant's state of residence.(6) When the appellant or appellant's representative or counsel, withoutreasonable cause, fails to appear at the hearing, the appellant's appealwill be considered concluded. If the appellant's failure to appear is forreasons beyond the control of the appellant or a request for postponementis with reasonable cause, the hearing officer will reschedule the hearingat a time convenient to all interested parties, but usually not later than15 calendar days after the initially scheduled date.(7) At any time before the scheduled hearing, the appellant may waive theopportunity for a hearing and, instead, request that the hearing officermake a decision based on the file, any written statements or evidence theappellant may submit and any other information the hearing officer deemsnecessary.(8) The hearing will ordinarily be based on the material before the decisionmaker at the time the decision was made and on the reasons for the adversedecision set out in the decision letter. If any changes of circumstancesor other occurrences material to the decision arise after the appeal hasbeen requested, the decision maker must immediately advise the hearingofficer (or, if one has not been assigned, the area supervisor) and theappellant. The hearing officer or area supervisor will, in such event,delay the hearing, return the decisional file to the decision maker forreconsideration, or take such other action as is appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1900.57 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Hearing rules.</ITAG>(a) The hearing will be an informal proceeding at which the appellant hasthe responsibility of showing why the initial decision should be modifiedor reversed.
