They said 15 Palestinians were treated for beatings inflicted byIsraeli troops.   The death toll was the highest in the occupied territories for asingle day since June 16, when Israeli soldiers shot to death twoPalestinians and wounded 18 in the village of Beit Furik.   In Arab east Jerusalem, Palestinian assailants stoned fourIsraeli buses and firebombed a fifth. Police said a Palestiniangirl was injured by a stone, and two Palestinians were arrested onsuspicion of stone-throwing.   Also on Monday, Economics Minister Gad Yaacobi said the7-month-old Palestinian uprising has cost Israel more than $600million, including losses in tourism, exports and productionrevenues.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel has spent about $160million to quell the disturbances in the West Bank and Gaza Stripin which 220 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killedaccording to U.N. figures. Israel captured the territories in the1967 Middle East war. Israel's gross national product was $27billion in 1987, including $1.6 billion from tourism. Tourism isexpected to lose about $300 million this year.   Monday's worst clashes occurred in Nablus, the largest town inthe West Bank, where troops fired on a crowd of protesters.   They shot 17-year-old Sares Anabtawi in the chest and the youthdied on his way to the hospital, officials at Al Ittihad Hospitalsaid. They said seven Palestinians were treated for gunshot woundsand 15 for beating injuries.   Officials at St. John's Hospital in Nablus said six Arabs,including a 12-year-old boy, were treated for bullet wounds and oneman was in serious condition.   Hospital officials had said earlier that 16 people were beingtreated for gunshot wounds.   Army officials said they had reports of one dead and ninewounded, and were investigating whether they were shot by soldiers.   An army spokeswoman said the disturbances erupted after thefuneral of an elderly Nablus resident who died of natural causes.   When inciters spread rumors that the man was killed by soldiers,Nablus residents poured into the streets, burned tires and stonedtroops, the spokeswoman said.   After news of the death spread in Nablus, Palestinian youthstook to the streets, erecting barricades of burning tires andthrowing stones at soldiers, an Arab reporter said.   The reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said clashesraged throughout the city, and large numbers of soldiers wererushed to the scene.   In the West Bank village of Anabta, troops fired Monday onstudents who hurled rocks and empty bottles at them after classeswere released, the army said. A 16-year-old student identified asHassan Addas was shot three times in the chest and killed,according to hospital officials.   The clash took place as schools reopened in the West Bank forthe first time in a week. The army had closed all 800 schools inthe occupied area, contending they were a focal point ofanti-Israeli riots.   Also Monday, reserve Gen. Menachem Meron said the Arab uprisingwas a threat to Israel's preparedness for combat with neighboringArab states.   ``There is a risk that in time we will turn into experts in riotcontrol at the expense of combat readiness,'' Meron told the Itimnews agency. ``Does sitting in the territories contribute to ourcombat readiness?''   In another development, several Israeli Arabs suspected ofcarrying out arson attacks on forests and farmland in Israel havebeen jailed for six months each without trial, the daily YediotAhronot reported.   The Defense Ministry declined comment.   Since the uprising began, the government has ordered more than2,000 Palestinians from the occupied territories jailed withouttrial, but such measures have rarely been taken against IsraeliArabs.</TEXT></DOC>
