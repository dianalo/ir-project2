Despite being at the cutting edge of many business trends this decade, from robotics to computer-controlled parts-making systems, the 104-year-old machine maker continues to struggle to make that leadership pay off.    It has posted losses in three of the past six years, including last year's $80 million net loss following an $83 million restructuring charge. Consequently, shareholder equity slumped 43% in that period.    Fortunately for its management, Milacron also was in the forefront of establishing a weighted system of shareholder voting, which gives officials some protection against hostile raiders while they launch their third restructuring in seven years.    They may need it. While industry executives and analysts believe the company is finally getting it all together, the process of rebuilding profit to acceptable levels may last into the next decade. &quot;Milacron is a fine company, but it's a company for the 1990s,&quot; contends Eli S. Lustgarten, a machinery analyst with PaineWebber Inc.    Milacron's latest restructuring aims to decentralize what has been a bureaucratic concern and, in the process, to pare costs -- mostly overhead -- by about $45 million a year when fully implemented in mid-1989. The lower-valued dollar already is helping strengthen orders; it has made the company cost-competitive with imports for the first time in about five years.    Consequently, earnings projections also are looking up. Ron Petrie, a machinery analyst at McDonald andamp; Co., Cleveland, is one of the more optimistic about Milacron. He expects the company to earn $1.50 a share in 1988 and $3 a share next year.    Daniel J. Meyer, Milacron's president and chief operating officer since last November, declines to make a forecast, but says he &quot;would consider $1 a share (for 1988) as a very good year.&quot; Next year will be better, he says, as additional savings from restructuring are realized.    What accounts for Milacron's previous troubles? Some analysts, including PaineWebber's Mr. Lustgarten, believe the company simply moved too far ahead of its market. Milacron's big beige machine tools -- attended only by canary yellow robots, all controlled by computers -- were the hit of many industry trade shows. But few companies were willing to shell out $10 million or $20 million for a so-called flexible manufacturing system. Meanwhile, Japanese producers -- aided by an over-valued dollar -- stole away the market for individual machine tools.    Milacron wasn't alone. Other U.S. capital-goods makers, which also bet heavily that U.S. industry was ready to replace most existing plants with computer-controlled &quot;factories of the future,&quot; took a beating, too. Some, like General Electric Co. and Westinghouse Electric Corp., were large enough to retrench in factory automation and still earn decent profits. Some small concerns fell by the wayside.    Now, Milacron is betting it can boost earnings by serving its traditional customers better. Yet it isn't easy to serve both giant aerospace concerns and one-man machine shops. Milacron also must walk a narrow line, supplying the machines that manufacturers want today without backing away from advanced technology. Otherwise competitors, particularly foreign concerns, will get a hammerlock on the future.    The latest restructuring will help Milacron stay on that line. The company is creating five &quot;focus factories&quot; for domestic machine tools, one for each of four major types of machines and one for replacement parts. Another focus factory is for robots. Each unit is responsible for developing new machines and making them efficiently.    The focus factories also will work closely with customers to help clinch the sale once a centralized marketing group has lined up a prospect, says 32-year-old Christopher C. Cole, the company's new vice president, machine tools.    In addition, a new Advanced Manufacturing Systems division, which puts together the sophisticated systems, has become a profit center that must earn its own way. Previously, a lot of development spending on computerized systems was justified on the basis that it helped sell Milacron's machine tools.    This new arrangement aims to assure that product development work &quot;is customer driven, rather than technology driven,&quot; Mr. Cole says. Advanced technology is fine, he adds, as long as customers are willing to buy it. &quot;In the past, that hasn't always been the case,&quot; he says.    Mr. Meyer, the president, who came up through finance and administration, is willing to take other new approaches, including joint ventures, to increase machine-tool profits. Machine tools accounted for 45% of Milacron's $828 million of sales last year.    The restructuring will pare employment in Cincinnati by about 800 during the next 18 months. &quot;In some areas, we're eliminating three layers of middle management,&quot; Mr. Meyer says. About 550 employees will be offered early retirement, he says, and some layoffs already have taken place.    Robots, which have been a disappointment for Milacron and almost everyone else who made them, also should do better after the restructuring consolidates the whole operation in Greenwood, S.C. But Milacron has less ambitious plans for robots than it did five years ago. Robots do repetitive tasks well, but frequently at a higher cost than simpler equipment.    Milacron is abandoning one effort to cash in on the electronic age. It plans to sell a unit that produces silicon wafers used for semiconductors and computer chips. Wafer production appeared so promising three years ago that Milacron doubled its production capability, but the market failed to develop as expected.    In retrospect, Milacron may have been too aggressive in factory automation, robots and wafers, but it probably was too hesitant to expand in plastics machinery. This business has been a consistent profit producer, but last year it accounted for only 28% of Milacron's sales. In the past two years, however, the company has made strategic acquisitions and developed new machines that broaden its product line.    Mr. Meyer says he hopes to build plastics machinery to a third of Milacron's sales, equaling machine tools. The remaining third would come from assorted industrial products, ranging from robots and electronic controls to measuring equipment and grinding wheels.    Mr. Meyer says expansion of this third group will make the company a little less capital-intensive, as the company sells more software and manufacturing expertise. </TEXT></DOC>
