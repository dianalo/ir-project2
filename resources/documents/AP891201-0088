In the absence of the summit-bound President Bush, Quayle wasthe administration's point man in Washington on the Philippinesdevelopments.   The timing of the coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino gave him achance to break out of the sidekick role that generally keeps himin the White House background.   He canceled a Florida speechmaking trip Friday and spokefrequently by telephone to Bush and other U.S. officials as theyflew to Malta and after they arrived, according to Quayle aides.   Bush left for his summit meeting with Soviet President MikhailS. Gorbachev just as the coup attempt was breaking out Thursdayagainst the U.S.-backed Aquino regime.   Quayle stayed overnight Thursday in the White House situationroom, and ``was constantly facilitating the conversation, askingquestions and keeping the flow of information going'' among U.S.military and policy officials who were analyzing courses of action,said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.   The coup attempt appeared to falter, as U.S. war planes flewmenacingly over strongholds of the mutinous military forces.However officials at the Pentagon said late Friday that thefighting was not over.   Quayle ``ran effective meetings, asked the right questions,pushed people for their recommendations and understood that his wasnot the role of the decision maker,'' but rather one whotransmitted recommendations to Bush, said one administrationofficial involved.   The all-night discussions took place with some participants inthe situation room and others at their own agencies via two-waytelevision, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   With Bush out of the country, Quayle believed it was importantfor him to be present, said another official, adding, ``We do notwant to see the Al Haig situation.''   The comment was in reference to the scene at the White Houseafter the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan whenthen-Vice President Bush was out of town. Then-Secretary of StateAlexander Haig sternly announced that he was ``in charge here,''pending Bush's return from Texas.   The comment was seen as an attempt to usurp authority ratherthan an indication that everything was under control.   On Thursday evening, as the Philippines mutineers gained ground,Quayle was at the vice presidential residence, keeping abreast bytelephone.   As the situation deteriorated, meetings were held in the WhiteHouse involving deputies from agencies including the Pentagon,National Security Council, State Department and CIA. They discussedpossible options for U.S. action as they monitored developments inManila.   Quayle received a call from Deputy National Security AdviserRobert Gates just after 10 p.m. informing him that Mrs. Aquino, whowas talking frequently by telephone to U.S. Ambassador NicholasPlatt, had asked for U.S. assistance.   After consulting with Gates, Quayle called an 11:30 p.m. meetingof the NSC principals who were not traveling with Bush, inaccordance with NSC procedures, said David Beckwith, Quayle's presssecretary.   By the time they met, Mrs. Aquino specifically asked for airsupport over the two bases held by the rebels.   Just before the meeting started, Quayle and Defense SecretaryDick Cheney spoke by telephone with Bush.   ``He said he would await their recommendation,'' said Beckwith.   After a 45-minute discussion, the group unanimously recommendedapproving Mrs. Aquino's request, and Bush sent the F-4 fightersfrom Clark Air Base in Manila.   Quayle telephoned her to tell her of the decision. He thencalled House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell to tell them what was happening, said Beckwith.   Quayle went home around 5:30 a.m., then returned to the WhiteHouse around 9:30.   He told Bush in a midday telephone conversation that he wouldinform appropriate congressional leaders of the state of affairs.He called several members, his office said.   He sent his wife Marilyn in his place to make the appearances inFlorida.</TEXT></DOC>
