Gen. Abdul Hadi Majali said 60 Communist Party members werereleased Saturday evening after four months of detention.   Security officials rounded up Communist Party members and otherpolitical activists after riots erupted in dozens of towns overprice increases and economic difficulties.   At least nine people were killed and more than 90 were injured.   Most of the rioters at the time insisted that the unrest was notspawned by any group, although police arrested a variety ofleftists, independent government critics and Islamic fundamentalists.   Communists distributed anti-government leaflets during the riots,but most of the leaflets were circulated in cities where nodisturbances occurred.   Majali said the release was in line with King Hussein's wish to``reunite them (detainees) with their families.''   Majali said those freed were ``the only detainees'' who remainedin prison following the riots.   Many detainees were released within a few days of their arrest.In May, Interior Minister Salem Masadeh announced that an additional68 political activists had been freed.   Jordan banned political parties in 1957 following a coup attempt.</TEXT></DOC>
