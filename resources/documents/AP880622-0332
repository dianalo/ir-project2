MeraBank Federal Savings and Loan, with $6.4 billion in assets,took over First Financial _ A Savings Association, based in ElPaso; and Brownfield Federal Savings and Loan Association inBrownfield. MeraBank, based in Phoenix, Ariz., is the largestthrift institution in that state and the 25th-largest in the UnitedStates.   First Financial has seven branches in El Paso, three inAmarillo, two in Lubbock, one in Canyon and one in Pampa.Brownfield Federal has no branches.   The transaction was the third under the terms of the SouthwestPlan, which aims to consolidate and recapitalize Texas' savings andloan industry.   MeraBank, which already has seven branches in Texas, iscontributing $8.8 million in new capital to the deal to acquireFirst Financial, with $330 million in assets, and Brownfield, with$40 million.   MeraBank also agreed to acquire a third major insolvent Texasthrift later this year as part of the transaction. It is forming aseparate subsidiary, MeraBank Texas, to hold the three Texasinstitutions.   The subsidiary will be based in El Paso with administrativeheadquarters in Dallas. Bank board officials said they expectMeraBank Texas to consolidate all its operations in Texas withinsix to nine months.   MeraBank officials still don't know how much in outstandingloans they will have to write off, said Arthur Gonzalez, presidentof MeraBank's Texas division.   He said officials have not yet inventoried the two thrifts' loanportfolios and are unsure how many employees they have inheritedfrom the ailing thrifts.   ``This acquisition ... was a little unusual in what we agreed todo with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board without lots ofinformation,'' Gonzalez said.   ``We had to diversify ourselves,'' said Gene Rice, chairman andchief executive officer of MeraBank. ``Any time a bank has all itseggs in one basket, it can get in trouble. Our long-term objectiveis to have 20 percent of our bank in Arizona, 20 percent in Texasand the balance in other places.''   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures Sandamp;Ldeposits up to $100,000, will hold warrants for 20 percent of thesubsidiary's stock, officials said.   First Financial and Brownfield are the ninth and 10th savingsand loan cases resolved by federal regulators in Texas this year,while 40 nationwide have been resolved.   The state's institutions, hard hit by slumps in the oil industryand Texas real estate, accounted for $3 billion of the industry's$3.8 billion loss in the first three months of this year.   Regulators say 133 of Texas' 279 thrifts are insolvent undergenerally accepted accounting rules. The bank board hopes to reducethe number of savings and loans in Texas by about 150 this year.   Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said MeraBank's expansion inTexas ``will benefit Texas, the thrift industry and FSLIC.''   Rice called the transaction ``a tremendous time-consumingprocess.''   ``They (FHLB) didn't just walk out there with a tray full offruit and let us pick our fruit,'' said Rice.``We had to worktogether.''   The third thrift to be acquired by MeraBank, which is based inPhoenix, Ariz., would create a deal worth about $1 billion, he said.   Thrift industry officials said a $1.2 billion loss at SunbeltSavings Association of Dallas boosted losses by Texas' savings andloans to $3.5 billion during the first three months of 1988.   Analysts and industry officials said the losses were notunexpected. But House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs CommitteeChairman Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., said Tuesday the reportraises ``extremely serious questions about the rosy scenarios beingpeddled by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.''   Operating losses for the 477 institutions in the five statesserved by the Dallas office of the bank board widened during thefirst quarter of 1988 to $1.1 billion from $623 million in 1987.   Non-operating losses, primarily funds set aside to covernon-performing assets, increased to $2.8 billion from $609 million.</TEXT></DOC>
