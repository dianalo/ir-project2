(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>High-Speed Lightwave Component AnalysisandM;HIGH-SPEED FIBER OPTIC COMMUNICATIONS systems have emerged over the last halfdecade to compete with other forms of communications systems as acost-effective means of moving information.andP;  A decade ago, the possibility ofa commercially installed 500-Mbit/s fiber optic system seemed remote.andP;  Today,not only are many fiber optic systems operating at hundreds of megabits persecond, but pilot systems are being installed that operate at 1.7 to 2.4gigabits per second.andP;  The trend toward higher system bit rates places moredemand upon the lightwave component designer to optimize the performance ofeach device within the high-speed lightwave system.andM;Lightwave System ChallengesandM;Fig.andP;  1 shows the typical functional blocks in a fiber optic communicationsystem.andP;  The high-speed portions of the lightwave system are thepreamplifier, the directly modulated laser, the optical fiber, the photodiodereceiver, and the postamplifier.andP;  As systems transmit higher bit rates, eachof the components needs to be designed to meet the higher speed requirements.andO;However, with the higher speeds, optimization of signal transmission throughthe various devices becomes more challenging and the interactions of variouscomponents become more evident and difficult to minimize.andM;Fig.andP;  2 shows some of the typical challenges the high-speed componentdesigner encounters as systems move to gigabit-per-second transmission rates.andO;As in lower-bit-rate systems, optical power budgets are affected by theinsertion loss of the optical fiber, connectors, and splices.andP;  In thehigher-bit-rate systems (andgt;500 Mbits/s), interactions between the high-speeddevices are significant.andP;  Often more extensive analysis and devicecharacterization are required to optimize the electrical and opticalinterfaces between these high-speed components in a systematic way.andM;For example, electrical mismatches between the laser and its preamplifier orbetween the photodiode and its postamplifier can affect the modulationtransfer function and the cumulative modulation bandwidth.andP;  Also, lightreflected back into the laser source affects its modulation transfercharacteristics and the system signal-to-noise ratio.andM;Lightwave Component Analyzer SystemsandM;Fig.andP;  3 shows the key instruments that form the HP 8702A Lightwave ComponentAnalyzer measurement systems.andP;  Three basic systems are offered:andM;* Modulation capability to 6 GHz at 1300 nmandM;* Modulation capability to 3 GHz at 1300 nm (high dynamic range)andM;* Modulation capability to 3 GHz at 1550 nm (high dynamic range).andM;Each HP 8702A system consists of a lightwave source, a lightwave receiver,the lightwave component analyzer, and a lightwave coupler.andP;  Fig.andP;  4 shows theHP 83400 family of lightwave sources and receivers, which are importantelements of the measurement systems.andP;  More information on these sources andreceivers can be found in the article on page 52.andM;The system measures the modulation transfer function of a device under testand provides the modulation amplitude and phase response of that device.andP;  Theinput or stimulus signal can either be a radio frequency (RF) signal or amodulated optical signal, and the output or response signal can either be anRF signal or a modulated optical signal.andP;  Thus, the device under test (DUT)can be an electrical-to-electrical, electrical-to-optical,optical-to-electrical, or optical-to-optical device, depending upon themeasurement block diagram employed and the calibration procedure used.andP;  TableI shows typical examples of each device type.andP;  By adding an optical signalseparation device, such as a lightwave directional coupler, the system can beconfigured to measure optical reflections in a wide variety of opticaldevices, such as optical fiber components, connectors, anti-reflectioncoatings, bulk optic devices, and so on.andP;  Moreover, if there are multiplereflections in a device, each reflection can be located very accurately.andO;Multiple reflections can be resolved when they are only centimeters apart.andM;In this article, lightwave component analysis means the capability tocharacterize a given device in terms of its modulation transfer function,electrical driving-point impedance, optical return loss, and length, asappropriate to the device type.andM;Lightwave Component Analyzer OperationandM;The hardware design of the HP 8702A Lightwave Component Analyzer is virtuallyidentical to that of the HP 8753B RF Network Analyzer.andP;  However, the HP 8702Ahas operating features that make it more appropriate for lightwavemeasurements.andM;The HP 8702A consists of three main subsystems that tie together thelightwave measurement system: an RF source, RF receivers, andprocessing/display (see Fig.andP;  5).andP;  The lightwave measurement system isanalogous to a lightwave communication system.andP;  The HP 8702A performs thefunctions of an information source and an information receiver.andP;  The dataprocessing subsystem uses this information to measure the modulation transfercharacteristics of lightwve components.andM;Signals used to modulate a lightwave source are produced by a synthesized RFsource in the HP 8702A.andP;  The RF source provides linear, logarithmic, and listfrequency sweeps from 300 kHz to 3 GHz with 1-Hz resolution.andP;  Power and CWsweeps may also be generated.andP;  The source is phase locked to the R receiverchannel, which is described below.andP;  The HP 8702A provides the power supplyfor lightwave sources and receivers.andM;Demodulated signals from a lightwave receiver are measured by three300-kHz-to-3-GHz, tuned RF receivers in the HP 8702A.andP;  The receivers'bandwidths are extended to 6 GHz with Option 006.andP;  Measurements of electricaldevices have a dynamic range of over 100 dB.andP;  A portion of the R receiversignal is used to phase lock the source to the reference channel.andP;  Inputsignals are sampled and down-converted to a 4-kHz IF.andP;  The 4-kHz If signalsfor the A, B, and R inputs are converted into digital words by theanalog-to-digital converter (ADC).andM;The data processing flow from the ADC to the display is shown in Fig.andP;  6.andO;The digital filter performs a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) on the digitalwords.andP;  The samples are converted into complex number pairs.andP;  The DFT filtershape can be altered by changing the IF bandwidth.andP;  Decreasing the Ifbandwidth is an effective technique for noise reduction.andP;  A reduction of theIF bandwidth by a factor of ten lowers the measurement noise floor byappoximately 10 dB.andM;Ratio calculations are performed next, if the selected measurement is theratio of two inputs, that is, A/R, B/R, or A/B.andP;  The ratio is formed by asimple division operation.andM;The sampler/IF correction operation is applied next.andP;  This process digitallycorrects for frequency response error, primarily sampler roll-off, in theanalog down-conversion path.andM;Sweep-to-sweep averaging is another noise reduction technique.andP;  This involvestaking the complex exponential average of several consecutive sweeps weightedby a user-specified averaging factor.andP;  Each new sweep is averaged with theprevious result until the number of sweeps equals the averaging factor.andO;Doubling the averaging factor reduces the noise by 3 dB.andP;  This technique canonly be used with ratio measurements.andM;The raw data arrays store the results of all of the preceding data processingoperations.andP;  All processing up to this point is performed in real time by thefast digital signal processor shown in Fig.andP;  5.andP;  The remaining operations areperformed asynchronously by the main processor.andP;  These arrays can be storedto an external disc drive and can be accessed directly via the HP-IB (IEEE488, IEC 625).andM;Vector error correction is performed next, if a measurement calibration hasbeen performed and correction is turned on.andP;  Error correction removesrepeatable systematic errors (stored in the error coefficient arrays) fromthe raw arrays.andP;  This can vary from simple vector normalization to fulltwo-port (12-term) error correction.andP;  Correction for the various types oflightwave measurements is described in more detail below.andM;The results of error correction are stored in the data arrays as complexnumber pairs.andP;  The data arrays can be stored to disc and accessed via theHP-IB.andP;  If the data-to-memory operation is performed, the data arrays arecopied into the memory arrays.andP;  The memory array is also externallyaccessible.andM;The trace math operation selects either the data array, the memory array, orboth to continue flowing through the data processing path.andP;  In addition, thecomplex ratio of the two (data/memory) or the difference (data -- memory) canalso be selected.andP;  If memory is displayed, the data from the memory arraysgoes through the same data processing flow path as the data from the dataarrays.andM;Gating is a digital filtering operation associated with time-domain transform(Option 010).andP;  Its purpose is to remove unwanted responses isolated in time.andO;In the time domain, this can be viewed as a time-selective bandpass orband-stop filter.andM;The delay block involves adding or subtracting phase in proportion tofrequency.andP;  This is equivalent to extending or shortening the electricallength in the measurement path or artificially moving the reference plane.andM;Conversion, if selected, transforms the measured s-parameter data to theequivalent complex impedance or admittance values, or to inverses-parameters.andM;The transform operation converts frequency-domain information into the timedomain when time-domain transform is enabled (option 010 only).andP;  The resultresemble time-domain reflectometry (TDR) or impulse-response measurements.andO;The transform employs the chirp-Z inverse Fourier transform algorithm.andO;Windowing is a digital filtering operation that prepares the frequency domaindata for transform to the time domain.andP;  The windowing operation is performedon the frequency-domain data just before the transform.andM;Formatting converts the complex number pairs into a scalar representation fordisplay, according to the selected format.andP;  Formats include log magnitude indB, phase, and group delay.andP;  Polar and Smith chart formats retain complexdata for display on real and imaginary axes.andM;Smoothing is another noise reduction technique.andP;  When smoothing is on, eachdata point in a sweep is replaced by the moving average value of severaladjacent points.andP;  The number of points included depends on the smoothingaperture, which is selected by the user.andP;  The result is similar to videofiltering.andM;The results at this point in the data processing chain are stored in theformat arrays.andP;  Marker values, marker functions, and limit testing are allderived from the format arrays.andP;  The format arrays can be stored to anexternal disc drive and can be accessed via the HP-IB.andM;The offset and scale operations prepare the formatted data for display on theCRT.andP;  This is where the reference line position, reference line value, andscale calculations are performed as appropriate to the format and graticuletype.andM;The display memory stores the display image for presentation on the CRT.andP;  Theinformation here includes graticules, annotation, and softkey labels in aform similar to plotter commands.andP;  When hard-copy records are made, theinformation sent to the plotter or printer is taken from display memory.andM;The HP 8702A can be connected with an s-parameter test set (HP 85046A) tomake electrical reflection measurements, such as s-parameters s.sub.11 andS.sub.22 (return loss and impedance).andP;  An HP 85047A S-Parameter Test Set canbe used to measure modulation transfer function to 6 GHz.andM;Firmware FeaturesandM;The principal contributions of the HP 8702A are its firmware enhancements.andO;The firmware was developed using the HP 8753A RF Network Analyzer as aplatform.andP;  The HP 8702A firmware contains the features of the HP 8753A aswell as new features specific to lightwave measurements.andP;  The mostsignificant enhancement is the ability to perform measurement calibration oflightwave components.andM;The measurement calibration process consists of measuring a characterizedstandard and using it to measure an unknown device.andP;  The firmware contains amathematical model of the calibration standard and the model's parameters.andO;Data from measurement of the standard is used with the calibration models toremove systematic errors from measurements of the test device.andP;  Lightwavemeasurements are also scaled to proper units for the particular componenttype.andM;Calibration of optical devices is performed using through connections andknown reflections as standards.andP;  Calibration is done for transmissionmeasurements by connecting the lightwave source to the lightwve receiver withthe test device removed.andP;  Reflection measurements require a known reflectionas a calibration standard.andP;  For example, the Fresnel reflection occurring atthe test port connector of a lightwave coupler is a repeatable and convenientreflection standard (3.5%).andM;Calibrated lightwave receivers and calibrated lightwave sources are used asstandards for electrooptical and optoelectrical test device measurements.andO;The calibration process is the same for both types of devices.andP;  Calibrationinformation is provided in two forms.andP;  The first form is a digitizedmodulation frequency response of the standard.andP;  This information is read bythe analyzer from a disc provided with each calibrated source and receiver.andO;The second is a curve fit of the frequency response.andP;  Coefficients areentered by the user into the analyzer using values printed on each lightwavesource and receiver.andM;Calibration of electrical devices is the same as in most HP networkanalyzers.andP;  Calibration kits containing standard devices are available forseveral different connector types.andP;   Typical standards include shorts, opens,and loads.andM;Time-domain transform, an optional feature of the HP 8702A, is an extremelypowerful tool in lightwave measurements.andP;   Data measured in the frequencydomain is converted to the time domain using a chirp Fourier transformationtechnique.andP;  The resulting time scale is extremely accurate and stable becauseof the synthesized frequency sweep.andP;  Measurements of distance can be derivedfrom transmission or reflection measurements using the index of refraction orvelocity factor of the test device.andP;  The HP 8702A has an enhancement toassist in setting transform parameters.andP;  The distance range and resolution ofthe transformed data depend on the width of the frequency-domain sweep andthe number of data points.andP;  The transform parameters feature assists the userby displaying range and resolution values as sweep parameters are set (Fig.andO;7).andM;Measurement ConceptandM;The lightwave component analyzer measurement concept is shown in Fig.andP;  8.andO;The information source provides a sine wave whose amplitude and phasecharacteristics are known.andP;  This signal serves as the modulation signal tothe lightwave source (transmitter).andP;  The output signal of the transmitter isan intensity modulated optical carrier at a fixed wavelength.andP;  The intensitymodulation (i.e., amplitude modulation) envelope of the lightwave signal isproportional to the radio frequency sine wave information signal.andP;  Becausethe laser lightwave source is dc-biased in the linear region of itsoptical-power-versus-input-current characteristic, the average optical powerfrom the lightwave source is the same whether or not a modulation signal ispresent.andM;The intensity modulated signal from the lightwave source is transmittedthrough the optical medium, most commonly optical fiber, although it could bean open-beam environment.andP;  The lightwave receiver demodulates the intensitymodulated lightwave signal and recovers the sinusoidal RF envelope, which isproportional to the sine wave from the information source.andP;  The demodulatedsignal is compared in magnitude and phase to the original signal by the HP8702A analyzer.andM;The optical signal incident upon an optical device under test is of the form:TRANSFORM PARAMETER  Channel 1 RANGE  13.6905 m RESPONSE RESOLUTION  133.79mm TRANSFORM SPAN  40 NS RANGE RESOLUTION  41.067 mm TRANSFORM MODE  BANDPASSSTART FREQUENCY  300 kHz STOP FREQUENCY  3 GHz FREQUENCY SPAN  2.9997 GHzNUMBER of POINTS  201 INDEX of REFRACTION  1.46 PULSE WIDTH  651.55 ps SOURCEPOWER  0 dBm SWEEP TIME  800 ms f(t) = a(t)cos(wt) where a(t) is the RFmodulation signal and cos(wt) represents the lightwave carrier signal at agiven wavelength.andM;The device under test operates on the amplitude of both the modulationenvelope and the carrier signal identically and delays both signals byidentical amounts, yielding the following relationship for the DUT output:g(t) = !H!a(t + [delta]t)cos(w(t + [delta]t)), where !H! is the magnitude ofthe transfer function of the DUT, [delta]t = [phi]/w, and [phi] is the phaseof H.andM;The impact of the DUT on the carrier can be determined by measuring themodulation envelope.andP;  Basically, the measurement process consists of twosteps: (1) calibration of the system, and (2) measurement of the DUT.andP;  Thismeasurement process is essentially a substitution method.andP;  The system iscalibrated by measuring a known quantity and then the DUT is substituted forthe known device and measured.andM;Electrooptical Calibration TheoryandM;Two important electrooptical devices are lasers and photodiodes.andO;Measurements of their modulation transfer characteristics and modulationbandwidths are of primary interest for the design of high-speed lightwavecommunications systems.andP;  The development of electrooptical calibrationroutines for measuring electrooptical devices such as lasers and photodiodeswas a significant challenge.andM;Fig.andP;  9 shows the relationship between optical power and RF current fortypical electrooptical devices, such as lasers, optical modulators, andphotodiodes.andP;  The slopes of the curves at points (I.sub.a.,P.sub.a.) and(P.sub.b.,I.sub.b.) define the slope responsivities of theelectrical-to-optical and optical-to-electrical devices, r.sub.s andR.sub.r., respectively, as shown.andM;For electrical-to-optical devices: [delta]P.sub.o = r.sub.s [delta]I.sub.1(1) where [delta]P.sub.o is the peak-to-peak optical power swing, r.sub.s isthe slope responsivity of the electrical-to-optical device in W/A, and[delta]I.sub.1 is the peak-to-peak RF current swing.andM;For optical-to-electrical devices: [delta]I.sub.2 = r.sub.r [delta]P.sub.o(2) where [delta]I.sub.2 is the output peak-to-peak RF current swing, r.sub.ris the slope responsivity of the optical-to-electrical device in A/W, andP.sub.o is the peak-to-peak optical power swing.andM;The relationship between the device slope responsivities and RF current gaincan be derived from equations 1 and 2: [delta]I.sub.2./ [delta]I.sub.1 =r.sub.s.r.sub.r.. (3)andM;Equation 3 forms the basis for the electrooptical calibrations and allows themeasurement of an electrical-to-optical device separately from anoptical-to-electrical device, which is one of the contributions of themeasurement system.andM;For each HP lightwave source or receiver, a calibration data disc isprovided, which contains the device's slope responsivity, modulationamplitude frequency response, and modulation phase frequency response.andP;  Thisdata disc can be downloaded into the analyzer as part of the electroopticalcalibration procedure..sup.1  The calibration data is traceable to aninternal HP optical heterodyne system called the Optical HeterodyneCalibration system.andM;Laser Bandwidth and Power CompressionandM;MeasurementsandM;Fig.andP;  10 shows the measurement block diagram for lasers and otherelectrical-to-optical devices.andP;  In this configuration, laser diode and/orlaser transmitter characteristics such as responsivity, modulation bandwidth,modulation phase or deviation from linear phase, and modulation powercompression can be measured.andM;A commercially available 1-Gbit/s lightwave transmitter is used as anexample.andP;  The laser was dc-biased in the linear range of itsoptical-power-versus-input-current curve (about 15 mA above its threshold)and modulated with an incident RF power of approximately + 10 dBm.andP;  Themeasured laser responsivity (0.34W/A or -9.35 dB) and modulation bandwidth(about 600 MHz) are shown in the top trace in Fig.andP;  11.andM;The built-in inverse Fourier transform feature of the HP 8702A allowsmodulation frequency response data to be converted to the equivalent step orimpulse response.andP;  For the above example, where the laser was operating inthe linear region, an equivalent step response with rise time information canbe calculated and displayed, as shown in the bottom trace in Fig.andP;  11.andO;Notice that the transmitter's frequency response is peaked by about 2.5 dB at428 MHz.andP;  This accounts for the underdamped time-domain step response.andM;To illustrate the modulation power compression measurement, a commericallyavailable electrical-to-optical converter with an internal laser preamplifierwas selected.andP;  The same block diagram as shown in Fig.andP;  10 was used.andP;  Theanalyzer has the ability to change the RF signal power to the DUT over a25-dB range at a fixed modulation frequency.andP;  New calibration routines weredeveloped that allow the input RF power and modulated optical powermeasurement planes to be referenced at the connectors of the device undertest.andP;  Fig.andP;  12 shows two measurements.andP;  The top trace shows transmittermodulated optical power out as a function of RF power into the transmitter.andO;The bottom trace shows transmitter responsivity as a function of RF powerincident to the transmitter with the modulation frequency fixed at 400 MHz.andO;The top curve shows that the transmitter has a compressed modulated opticalpower of - 1.44 dBm (or 0.72 mW peak to peak) with an incident RF power of1.8 dBm.andP;  The bottom curve shows the transmitter responsivity linearity andcompression characteristics.andP;  The small-signal responsivity is 0.38W/A (or -8.3 dB) and compresses by 1 dB at - 4.4 dBm incident RF power.andM;Laser Reflection Sensitivity MeasurementsandM;Most high-speed lasers are sensitive to back-reflected light.andP;  The reflectedlight can couple back into the laser's cavity, be reamplified, and change thelaser's modulation transfer characteristics.andP;  The fine-grain ripple thatoften results is called reflection noise.andP;  fig.andP;  13 shows the measurementsetup to characterize the change in the laser's modulation transfer functionand bandwidth when different levels of light are intentionally reflected backinto the laser.andM;The directional coupler dtest port (point A) is where the reflected lightcondition is developed.andP;  The modulation frequency response is referenced to acondition in which no incident light at point A is reflected back toward thelaser under test, that is, an optical load is created at point A.andP;  Thisreference condition is normalized to 0 dB.andP;  When the reflection condition ischanged, the resulting measurement shows the deviation or change of thelaser's modulation response for that reflection condition (a laser reflectionsensitivity measurement).andP;  An example of such a measurement of a commerciallyavailable laser transmitter is shown in Fig.andP;  14.andP;  The worst responserepresents the condition when approximately 95% of the light was reflectedback to the laser under test.andP;  The improved response was achieved when apolarization controller was inserted between the test port and the 95%optical reflector and the polarization of the reflected light was adjusted tominimize the response roll-off.andM;Photodiode MeasurementsandM;Measurements characterizing optical-to-electrical devices, such asphotodiodes and lightwave receivers, are similiar to laser measurements.andP;  Themeasurement block diagram is shown in Fig.andP;  15.andM;Two-Port Optical Device MeasurementsandM;The loss, gain, and modulation bandwidth of any two-port optical device canbe measured using the measurement block diagram shown in Fig.andP;  16.andP;  Examplesof such devices are optical connectors, attenuators, other passive opticaldevices, modulators, and optical regenerators.andP;  In this measurement, theinput stimulus and output response signals are intensity modulated lightsignals.andP;  The device under test can be a single component or an opticalsubsystem such as an interferometer or sensor.andM;If an optical attenuator is selected as the device under test, not only canthe attenuator loss be measured, but also the effective measurement systemdynamic range can be determined for optical transmission measurements.andP;  Fig.andO;17 shows such a measurement.andP;  This particular system displays more than 50 dBof optical dynamic range.andM;Optical Reflection MeasurementsandM;The measurement of optical reflections and the identification of theirlocations are becoming more important in gigabit-rate lightwave systems,subsystems, optical sensors, and optical components.andP;  The HP 8702A system iswell-suited to perform optical reflection and length measurements on a widevariety of components and subsystems.andM;Fig.andP;  18 shows the block diagram for measuring optical reflections andoptical return loss of any optical device under test.andP;  If a device has morethan a single reflection, for example reflections of varying magnitudesspaced out at different distances in the device, the HP 8702A test system canmeasure the total reflection or each constituent reflection and itsrespective location.andP;  This system can be used to measure reflections of fiberoptic components or bulk optic components when the proper collimating opticsare added to the lightwave coupler test port in the test system.andM;If there are two or more reflections in the device under test, the individualreflections will have different phase relationships with respect to themeasurement reference plane at a fixed modulation frequency that will sum toa given modulation amplitude and phase.andP;  As the modulation frequency ischanged, the phase relationship of each individual reflection will change,depending on its delay time, resulting in a different overall modulationamplitude and phase ripple pattern.andP;  The ripple pattern contains thereflection magnitude and location information.andP;  By performing an inverseFourier transform on the ripple pattern, a signature of the individualreflections can be displayed as a function of time (and hence, distance).andM;The examples presented here show the reflection measurement capabilities ofHP 8702A Lightwave Component Analyzer systems on small components.andM;The first example shows that with a lensed optical fiber connector added tothe block diagram of Fig.andP;  18, reflections of optical devices can be measuredin an open-beam environment.andP;  The devices under test are a glass slide and aflat surface gold-plated to form a 95% reflective surface at 1300 nm.andP;  Infig.andP;  19, the top trace shows the ripple pattern generated from thereflections and rereflections from the glass slide and the gold wafer.andP;  Thebottom trace shows the individual reflections and rereflections and theirrespective locations in time (distance).andM;The second example shows the reflections in a length of fiber that has threeinternal mirrors fabricated to produce approximately 2% reflections at threedifferent locations in the fiber.andP;  This component is typical of devices foundin various fiber sensor applications.andP;  Fig.andP;  20 shows the device dimensionsand the measurement of the individual optical reflections and theirrespective locations.andP;  The absolute location of any of the individualreflections can be measured to within a few millimeters, given the correcttest conditions.andM;Fig.andP;  21 shows the optical return loss of the optical launch from a laserchip into the fiber identified by marker 3 (11.46 dB return loss), and theoptical return loss of the laser module's optical fiber connector at marker 2(about 37 dB return loss).andP;  Optical return loss of other optical devices andlaunches such as photodiodes, lenses, and antireflection coatings can also bemeasured easily.andM;The widest modulation frequency span limits the minimum separation at whichtwo adjacent reflections can be resolved, that is, the best two-pointresolution.andP;  For a 6-GHz modulation frequency span, the system's theoreticaltwo-point resolution is about 1.71 cm in fiber.andP;  Fig.andP;  22 shows a measurementof two reflections, about 4% each, spaced approximately 2 cm apart.andP;  Themodulation frequency span was 6 GHz.andP;  Individual reflections can be locatedwithin less than 2 mm.andM;Optical Heterodyne Calibration SystemandM;The transfer function of each lightwave source and receiver is measured atthe factory and stored on a disc, which is shipped with the product.andP;  Thiscalibration data is loaded into the HP 8702A Lightwave Component Analyzerduring the measurement calibration process.andM;System accuracy is adjusted at the factory using the simple but powerfulheterodyne or beat frequency technique shown in Fig.andP;  23.andP;  Light from twohighly stable single-line lasers is combined to form a single optical testbeam.andP;  The receiver under test effectively filters out the optical frequencyterms and develops a beat frequency response only.andP;  A frequency sweep isobtained by changing the temperature of one of the lasers..sup.2andM;A spectrum analyzer monitors the swept RF output of the lightwave receiverunder test.andP;  Narrowband filtering, feasible because of the less than 10-kHzlinewidth of the lasers, provides an exceptionally repeatable measurement.andM;Since the amplitude of the beat signal is a function of the polarization ofthe two laser beams, the system is implemented in polarization-maintainingfiber.andP;  Laser output polarization does not change over the modest temperaturetuning range.andP;  A second error source, variation of the laser output powerswith time and temperature, is eliminated by sampling their outputs throughoutthe measurement process and compensating for it.andP;  The receiver under test iscalibrated as an optical average power meter and its bias current ismonitored to measure variations in the average optical powers of the twolasers.andM;The resulting system is capable of generating beat frequencies from dc toover 40 GHz with over 50-dB dynamic range.andP;  A special reference receiver iscalibrated with this system and used to calibrate sources and receivers.andM;Exceptional laser performance is obtained from Nd:YAG ring lasers, CW-pumpedby shorter-wavelength diode lasers.andP;   Frequency tuning is accomplished bychanging the temperature of the ring, which is fully contained in a speciallyfaceted crystal.andM;Measurement Accuracy ConsiderationsandM;The HP 8702A system performance depends not only on the performance of theindividual instruments, but also on the measurement system configuration andon user-selected operating conditions.andP;  The HP 8702A system provides a set ofmeasurement calibrations for both transmission and reflection measurements.andM;The type of calibration depends on the type of device and the measurement.andO;For example, if the measurement is of optical insertion loss, a frequencyresponse calibration would be performed.andP;  This calibration removes from themeasurement the frequency response of the system.andP;  This is done by connectinga cable between the lightwave source and receiver.andP;  Once this measurementcalibration is stored, the DUT can be connected in place of the cable and acorrected measurement (i.e., the DUT's optical insertion loss) will bedisplayed.andM;In any measurement, sources of uncertainty influence the system's measurementaccuracy.andP;  The major ones are optical and RF connector repeatability,reflection sensitivity (or noise) of the laser source, directivity of acoupler in reflection measurements, and accuracy and repeatability ofstandards and models used in the measurement calibrations.andM;Connector repeatability is a measure of random variations encountered inconnecting a pair of optical or RF connectors.andP;  The uncertainty is affectedby torque limits, axial alignment, cleaning procedures, and connector wear.andO;Optical connector repeatability problems can be minimized by using precisionconnectors such as the Diamond HMS-10/HP connector,.sup.3 or by using splicesinstead of connectors.andM;Reflection sensitivity (or noise) refers to the change in the behavior of alaser (i.e., its transfer characteristics) when reflected light reenters thelaser cavity.andP;  The effect of the reflected light depends on many factors,including the magnitude, delay, and polarization of the reflected light.andO;Reflection sensitivity can be minimized by buffering the laser with anoptical attenuator or an optical isolator.andM;The term directivity refers to how well a directional coupler (optical orelectrical) directs a signal, or how well it separates the incident from thereflected signal.andP;  Directivity is calculated as the difference between thereverse isolation of the coupler and the forward coupling factor (e.g., ifreverse isolation is -50 dB and coupling factor is -3 dB, then thedirectivity is -50 - (-3) = -47 dB).andP;  However, while the coupler itself mayhave andgt;-50 dB directivity, the connectors and internal splices may causereflections that may reduce the effective directivity of the packagedcoupler.andM;Every measurement calibration uses standards that have default models withinthe HP 8702A instrument firmware or have data that is provided externally.andO;Each of these standards and models has accuracy and repeatabilitycharacteristics that affect the overall system uncertainty.andP;  For example,when calibrating for an electrooptical measurement, the user can enter thetransfer characteristic data of the lightwave source or receiver into the HP8702A in two ways: by using the factory-supplied 3.5-inch disc or by enteringthe calibration factors printed on a label for the source or receiver.andP;  Thelightwave source or receiver data has some accuracy relative to the factorysystem on which each instrument is measured.andP;  In addition, use of the3.5-inch disc data offers better model repeatability than the calibrationfactors printed on the label, since the calibration factors represent apolynomial fit to the data stored on the disc.andM;Example: Receiver Responsivity MeasurementandM;A photodiode receiver with 0.32 A/W or - 10 dB responsivity, - 14 dB ofoptical input mismatch, and - 14 dB of electrical mismatch was measured bythe system shown in Fig.andP;  24.andP;  The responsivity of the receiver can be readfrom the CRT in dB for any given modulation frequency.andM;The uncertainties considered while computing the accuracy of the measurementare as follows: optical match interaction of the lightwave source andreceiver, optical match interaction of the lightwave source and DUT,electrical match interaction of the lightwave receiver and the HP 8702Aanalyzer input, the same uncertainty for the DUT and the HP 8702A analyzerinput, reflection sensitivity of the lightwave laser, dynamic accuracy,lightwave receiver accuracy, lightwave receiver model uncertainty, andwavelength related uncertainty.andM;Fig.andP;  25 shows the uncertainty (dB) of the receiver responsivity measurement(described above) over an RF modulation frequency range of 300 kHz to 3 GHz.andO;The solid lines represent the maximum and minimum values for theconfiguration shown in Fig.andP;  24.andP;  The dashed line represents the value forthe same configuration with a low-reflection 10-dB optical attenuator betweenthe lightwave source and the DUT to reduce the reflection sensitivity of thelaser.andM;User InterfaceandM;A significant feature of the HP 8702A Lightwave Component Analyzer is theguided setup user interface.andP;  It consists of a series of softkey menus,instructions, and graphical displays to assist the user in configuringmeasurement hardware and in setting basic instrument parameters.andP;  Guidedsetup is one part of the user interface.andP;  The user is assisted in makingfundamental measurements without facing the entire set of advanced instrumentfeatures.andM;The HP 8702A uses RF and microwave network analysis techniques for makingvarious lightwave measurements.andP;  At the beginning of the project it was feltthat many of the potential HP 8702A users would be unfamiliar withtraditional HP network analyzers.andP;  A major goal of the project was to developa user interface that would be easy to use, particularly for those with nonetwork analyzer experience.andM;Guided setup provides a subset of the HP 8702A feature set.andP;  The user isgiven only the choices needed to set up a basic measurement.andP;  The commandsare accompanied by textual and graphical instructions in a logical sequence.andM;When the analyzer is first turned on, the user is given instructions onchoosing either guided setup or normal unguided instrument operation.andP;  At anytime after selecting normal operation, the user can start guided setupthrough one of the regular softkey menus.andP;  Conversely, the user can exitguided setup and go to normal instrument operation at any time.andM;Guided setup consists of a series of screens that assist the user inconfiguring a measurement and setting basic instrument parameters.andP;  Eachscreen consists of a softkey menu, instructions, and a graphical display.andO;The screens are ordered to teach the general measurement sequence recommendedin the User's Guide.andP;  Each screen contains an operation to be performed orparameters to be set.andP;  The user progresses through guided setup by pressingthe CONTINUE softkey.andP;  If existing values and/or instrument states aresatisfactory, the user can proceed without making changes by pressingCONTINUE.andP;  To return to a previous screen, the user presses the PRIOR MENUsoftkey.andM;Guided setup has the general sequence: select type of measurement (Fig.andP;  26),select type of device (Fig.andP;  27), configure measurement hardware (Fig.andP;  28),set instrument parameters, calibrate measurement, set measurement format andscale, print or plot measurement, and save instrument state in an internalregister.andM;Guided setup is structured so that action is focused on the display andsoftkey menus.andP;  The user is not required to use the labeled keys on the frontpanel with the exception of the entry keys.andP;  Instrument parameter values areentered using the numbered keys, the up/down arrow keys, or the knob.andP;  Valuesare entered in normal operation with the same method.andM;System PerformanceandM;Typical measurement system performance is dependent upon the lightwave sourceand receiver used with the HP 8702A Lightwave Component Analyzer.andP;  Inaddition, the system dynamic range and noise floor performance are dependenton the calibration routine selected (e.g., response or response/isolationcalibration) and the signal processing features used (e.g., IF bandwidth,signal averaging, signal smoothing).andM;The system dynamic range is defined as the difference between the largestsignal measured, usually given by a reference level of 0 dB, and a signal 3dB above the system noise floor, as measured in the frequency domain.andO;Besides the HP 8702A Lightwave Component Analyzer, the 3-GHz system includesan HP 83400A (1300 nm, 3 GHz, single-mode 9/125-[mu]m fiber), HP 83401A (1300nm, 3 GHz, multi-mode 50/125-[mu]m fiber), or HP 83403A (1550 nm, 3 GHz,single-mode 9/125-[mu]m fiber) Lightwave Source, an HP 83410B LightwaveReceiver, and an HP 11889A RF Interface Kit.andP;  The 6-GHz system includes an HP83402A (1300 nm, 6 GHz, single-mode 9/125-[mu]m fiber) Lightwave Source, anHP 83411A Lightwave Receiver, an HP 85047A 6-GHz S-Parameter Test Set, and anHP 8702A Lightwave Component Analyzer Option 006 (6-GHz capability).andP;  Forreflection measurements, the addition of a lightwave directional coupler isrequired in the measurement block diagram as shown in Fig.andP;  18.andP;  Dependingupon the optical fiber size, either an HP 11890A (single-mode 9/125-[mu]mfiber) or an HP 11891A (multimode 50/125-[mu]m fiber) Lightwave Couplershould be used.andM;To determine the system dynamic range, the system noise floor must bedetermined for the measurement.andP;  For the 3-GHz system, typical noise floorperformance is shown in Figs.andP;  29, 30, and 31.andP;  Fig.andP;  29 shows an averagednoise floor trace (ave = 16) for optical transmission measurements; it variesfrom - 55 dB at low frequencies to - 50 dB at 3 GHz, which yields a 47-dBdynamic range.andP;  Fig.andP;  30 shows an averaged noise floor trace (ave = 16) foroptical reflection measurement in the frequency domain; it varies from - 47dB to - 43 dB.andP;  This noise floor yields a 40-dB dynamic range in thefrequency domain.andP;  Fig.andP;  31 shows the effective system noise floor for anoptical reflection measurement viewed in the time domain.andP;  It is derived byperforming an inverse Fourier transform on the optical reflection noise floordata in the frequency domain shown in Fig.andP;  30.andP;  The effect of the inverseFourier transform on the frequency-domain data is to increase the measurementdynamic range in the time domain.andP;  Fig.andP;  31 shows a 12-dB improvement indynamic range or a noise floor of - 55 dB in the time/distance domain.andM;For the 6-GHz system, typical frequency-domain noise performance for opticaltransmission and reflection measurements is shown in Figs.andP;  32 and 33,respectively.andP;  Typical time-domain or distance-domain noise performance foroptical reflection measurements derived from frequency-domain data (Fig.andP;  33)is shown in Fig.andP;  34.andP;  In Fig.andP;  32, the noise trace was averaged sixteentimes and shows a - 38-dB worst-case point, which corresponds to a dynamicrange of 35 dB.andP;  Fig.andP;  33 shows an averaged (ave = 16) noise floorperformance of - 30 dB for optical reflection measurements obtained in thefrequency domain; this corresponds to a usable dynamic range of 27 dB,typically.andP;  For optical reflection measurements in the time or distancedomain, the averaged noise floor is reduced to - 41 dB, which corresponds toa dynamic range of 38 dB, typically.andM;Table II summarizes the typical system dynamic range for each combination oflightwave source and receiver in the HP 83400 family when used with the HP8702A Lightwave Component Analyzer.andM;AcknowledgmentsandM;Contributions to the development of the HP 8702A measurement systems camefrom many people located in HP Laboratories and other divisions ofHewlett-Packard.andP;
