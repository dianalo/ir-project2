In an eight-page decision, U.S. District Judge David S.Doty found that Robins Kaplan's bill to Senoret Chemical Co.-- more than $457,000 -- was &quot;fair and reasonable,&quot; that thelaw firm performed &quot;valuable legal services&quot; and that Senoret&quot;has been unjustly enriched&quot; by its refusal to pay the$329,028.57 balance due.</LP><TEXT>   During a two-day trial in September, the company's owners,John and Margie Roberts, argued that Robins Kaplan hadbreached its obligation to warn them of the risks and expenseof litigation in a fight with the Environmental ProtectionAgency over the safety of company's best-selling product,Terro Ant Killer. Robins Kaplan, which had sued Senoret fornonpayment, maintained that its bills were reasonable andthat the Robertses did not complain until after the case waslost. The dispute was the subject of a front-page story inThe Wall Street Journal in October.   Judge Doty's ruling in the case earlier this week&quot;demolishes the impression created by Senoret that they wereovercharged for legal services or that they received nobenefit for our services,&quot; said Elliott Kaplan, chairman ofthe 203-member firm, which is known for its aggressivelitigation tactics. &quot;We regret ever having to take action ofthis kind against a client but we felt we had no alternativeunder these circumstances,&quot; said Mr. Kaplan.   Mr. Roberts, Senoret's president, suffered a heart attackand has been housebound since the trial. Neither he nor hiswife were available for comment. Their lawyer, Charles S.Clayton of Minneapolis, said Judge Doty ignored testimonyfrom the only expert witness in the trial, a Minneapolisenvironmental attorney who criticized Robins Kaplan for notproviding the Robertses with detailed, written cost and riskestimates. He said an appeal is unlikely.   Judge Doty ruled in favor of Robins Kaplan on all thefacts in dispute. The Robertses contended that the originalretention letter they signed was misleading because the lawfirm provided no top estimate for fees and expenses,explaining that the total fee could not be predicted. Thejudge ruled that the document was &quot;a typical attorneyengagement letter setting forth the material terms andconditions of the engagement.&quot;   The Robertses also claimed that one of the law firm'sthree lawyers assigned to the case, Pamela Deese, failed tocommunicate a favorable settlement offer from the EPA thatwould have resolved the dispute without litigation. Here,too, the judge sided with Robins Kaplan. &quot;This settlementproposal was discussed at length between attorney PamelaDeese and both principals of Senoret and rejected by them,&quot;he wrote in his opinion.   Robins Kaplan's total bill came to $457,028.57, of whichthe Robertses paid $128,000 before refusing to pay more.Whether the Robertses will ever pay the balance remainsuncertain. Their lawyer, Mr. Clayton, said all their assetshave been leveraged for credit to keep their company afloat.   &quot;As a practical matter,&quot; said Mr. Clayton, &quot;We're going tohave to come to some settlement&quot; with Robins Kaplan.   ---   CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST warns about swamped federalcourts.   In a gloomy annual report made public yesterday, thecountry's top jurist predicted that unless Congress curbs thecourts' workload, there &quot;will be a degradation in the highquality of justice the nation has long expected of thefederal courts.&quot;   The number of both criminal and civil filings in federaltrial courts decreased slightly last year, but the chiefjustice pointed out that the overall number of pending casesrose. He painted a picture of frazzled judges scrambling fromone case to the next and of creeping &quot;bureaucratization&quot; byan army of judicial aides.   However, the chief justice discouraged the idea of addingmore judges. That, he said, would lead to even morebureaucracy, &quot;an almost unmanageable&quot; proliferation ofappeals courts, &quot;an increasingly incoherent body of federallaw and a Supreme Court incapable of maintaining uniformityin federal law.&quot;   Instead, Chief Justice Rehnquist urged Congress torestrict federal court jurisdiction over a variety of typesof cases, some of which would then be heard by state courts,and to limit the ability of state prisoners to file repeatedconstitutional appeals in the federal courts. Pendinglegislation curbing such appeals, known as habeas corpuspetitions, has been a topic of hot debate on Capitol Hill.   The chief justice also criticized proposals lawmakers madelast fall that would have provided for federal prosecution ofalmost any murder in which a gun was used.   ---   MARYLAND'S JUDGES to forfeit vacation days or salary dueto fiscal crisis.   Robert C. Murphy, chief judge of the Maryland Court ofAppeals, said that effective yesterday, all 240 state judgeswill give up five vacation days in 1992 or pay for the timeby taking salary cuts. Judge Murphy said the measure willsave about $500,000 of the $7 million in budget cuts thejudiciary plans to make because of the state's budget crisis.   State law prevents the imposition of judicial salaryreductions, so the seven-member Maryland Court of Appeals inearly December proposed vacation cuts. But some judges balkedat the idea, arguing that they needed their full allotment ofvacation days because the job, particularly for thosepresiding over urban courtrooms, is extremely stressful.Under the revised plan the judges, whose salaries range from$82,000 to $99,000, can buy back the time.   By leaving several judgeships vacant, furloughing otheremployees and imposing a hiring freeze, the judiciary hopesto meet the targeted $7 million in cuts.   ---   `BONFIRE' SUIT brought by New Jersey officials isdismissed.   A federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled that EssexCounty and its former executive, Nicholas R. Amato, did nothave the legal right to sue Robert N. Wilentz, chief justiceof the New Jersey Supreme Court, for refusing to allow TimeWarner Inc.'s Warner Bros. unit to film a scene for the movie&quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; in New Jersey courtrooms.   Warner had offered to donate $250,000 to a fund to restorecourthouses. When Judge Wilentz threatened to prohibit thefilming, Warner shot the scene elsewhere. Judge Wilentz saidthat the scene, showing a group of blacks rioting, could&quot;undermine the confidence of black citizens in ourcourtroom.&quot;   Mr. Amato and the county sued Judge Wilentz, claiming hisaction violated Warner 's First Amendment free speech rightsand cost the county the donation. A federal district courtjudge in December 1990 ruled that the county had the right tosue asserting Warner's rights but that Judge Wilentz wasimmune because he did not violate clearly established law.Both parties appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for theThird Circuit.   In opinion an issued this week, Judge Edward R. Becker,writing for a three-judge panel, ruled in Judge Wilentz'sfavor, reasoning that &quot;Essex County and its county executivelack third party standing to sue for harm caused by ChiefJustice Wilentz's alleged violation of the First Amendmentrights of Warner Brothers.&quot;   Lawyers for the parties could not be reached.   ---   NOTED: The Illinois Supreme Court stayed and plans toreconsider a new rule that restricts the subpoenaing oflawyers as witnesses in grand jury and other criminalproceedings. Federal prosecutors responded by dropping alawsuit they had filed against the disciplinary arm of thecourt. Prosecutors had complained that the rule would impedeinvestigations.</TEXT></DOC>
