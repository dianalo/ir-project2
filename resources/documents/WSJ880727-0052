The agreements, covering 28 commercial jets, have terms ranging from three to 10 years. Twenty of the jets were leased to five new customers, &quot;which demonstrates significant growth in our customer base,&quot; said Leslie L. Gonda, International Lease's chairman.    Aircraft leased under the agreements include Boeing Co. models 737, 747, 757 and 767; McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD82s and MD83s; and Airbus Industrie A310 widebody twin-jets.
