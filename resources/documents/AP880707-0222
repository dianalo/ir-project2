SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. Postal Service has turned to afederal court in an effort to thwart challenges to a contract itarranged with Texas computer billionaire H. Ross Perot.   At stake is a potentially multimillion-dollar contract to studyways to improve postal efficiency.   The deal is being challenged by would-be competitors who didn'tget to bid. They have asked the General Services Administration'sBoard of Contract Appeals to order suspension of the agreement, andthe board complied Thursday, ordering a temporary freeze on thecontract.   The Postal Service on Wednesday asked the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the Federal Circuit to rule that the contract board doesn'thave jurisdiction in the case.   The Postal Service contends that it is exempt from the federalprocurement law that calls for the GSA to arrange most governmentpurchases of data processing services and equipment.   That argument didn't wash with the Board of Contract Appeals,however, which declined to drop the case on jurisdictional grounds.   In a separate case last April, the board concluded that it didhave jurisdiction over the Postal Service and said that agency isindeed bound by the procurement rules.   Postal officials, insisting that they are not covered by thelaw, declined Tuesday to provide documents or individuals totestify before the board.   The Postal Service agreed that it did not follow provisions ofthe law, saying that that was because it has its own purchasingrules, which were followed.   The deal is being challenged by Electronic Data Systems Corp.,Perot's former company and now a part of General Motors Corp., andby Planning Research Corp. of McLean, Va.   The contract is in two phases. The first is a $500,000 agreementcalling for Perot to analyze postal operations and recommend waysto save money. It was announced June 2 and immediately drewcriticism from a variety of sources.   After the first 90-day phase, there is to be a second part, inwhich Perot would be paid a percentage of any savings the PostalService realized from implementing his recommendations for ways ofimproving its systems and procedures.   The Senate, meanwhile, has requested the General AccountingOffice to investigate terms of the deal, and directed the PostalService to delay the second phase in the meantime.</TEXT></DOC>
