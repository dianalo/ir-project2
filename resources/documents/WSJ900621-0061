Australia's Westpac Banking Corp. said it was closing itsWestpac Pollock Government Securities Inc. subsidiaryimmediately. The primary dealer had losses of about $29million in the first half of its year that began Oct. 1.</LP><TEXT>   Once one of the most coveted franchises in internationalfinance, the group of firms that deal with the New York Fedwhen it buys and sells U.S. government securities as part ofits activities to influence U.S. monetary policy -- known as&quot;primary dealers&quot; -- have had a tough time making money overthe past two years.   The U.S. government-bond business &quot;has become verydifficult,&quot; said John R. Burrus, president and chiefexecutive officer of CRT Government Securities Ltd., anotherprimary dealer. &quot;Trading volume is down, profit margins aredown, too, and volatility is way down from prior years.&quot;   Westpac is Australia's biggest bank with about 118 billionAustralian dollars (US$92.5 billion) in assets, of whichroughly 10% is in the U.S. The bank said most of the closedunit's approximately 160 employees have been dismissed.Westpac paid $120 million for Wm. E. Pollock GovernmentSecurities Inc., an independent securities firm, in late1986.   The securities subsidiary posted a deficit of $3.9 millionin fiscal 1989, ended Sept. 30, mostly because of lossesassociated with a failed attempt to start up amortgage-backed securities operation. But Anthony J. Walton,executive vice president and general manager at Westpac inNew York, said that the government-bond dealing operationshad remained profitable until this year.   People in the bond market said that Westpac tried sellingthe operations to France's Cie. Financiere de Paribas and abig Japanese bank, but was unsuccessful. Paribas didn'treturn a phone call for confirmation.   Some other firms are rumored to be either on the block orconsidering closing down their operations, several traderssaid.   Despite the closing, Mr. Walton said: &quot;Westpac's otheroperations in the U.S. are very healthy and very profitable.&quot;He said the bank maintained relationships with about 250major U.S. corporations.   &quot;You have to be very, very clear on focus, and we feltthat strategically the primary dealership no longer fitted asit did in 1986,&quot; said Mr. Walton, noting the intensecompetition in global securities markets. &quot;It's a very toughdecision to give up something that so many people prize suchas this; but at the end of the day, it's the shareholder thatcounts.&quot;   Last year, two British banks -- National Westminster BankPLC and Lloyds Bank PLC -- abandoned the business, along withL.F. Rothschild andamp; Co. Two dealerships were also eliminatedwhen Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. last year acquired thebrokerage business of Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. andDrexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. filed for protection underthe federal Bankruptcy Code.   Westpac's dropout lowers to 43 the number of primarydealers, from a peak of 46 at the end of 1988. Sixteen of thefirms are controlled by foreign institutions: eight Japanese,three British, two Swiss and one each from Canada and HongKong. The Fed also lists First Boston Corp. as a foreigninstitution, because over 50% of it is owned by foreigners,but doesn't assign it a specific national designation.However, some people regard it as a Swiss institution,because it is 44.5% owned by CS Holding, which also ownsCredit Suisse, a big bank.   Still, several firms, mostly foreign, have eagerly soughtto be designated as primary dealers. A major reason is thatnumerous U.S. pension funds, insurance companies and otherlarge institutional investors will do business only withprimary dealers. Moreover, winning admission is widelyconsidered a mark of prestige.   A subsidiary of Swiss Bank Corp. became a primary dealerin March. Last December, units of Union Bank of Switzerlandand Britain's Barclays Bank PLC joined the elite club. Andother foreign institutions, including West Germany's DeutscheBank AG, are waiting in the wings.</TEXT></DOC>
