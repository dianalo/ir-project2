KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Democratic chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee and a conservative Republican member aredrafting companion bills aimed at punishing countries that usechemical weapons and the private Western companies that help producethem.   The bills were announced at a hearing Tuesday in which senatorscited reports that the West German government did nothing to preventGerman industries from helping Middle Eastern nations obtainchemical warfare capability.   Also at the hearing, the head of the U.S. Arms Control andDisarmament Agency said the United States is now satisfied WestGermany is responsibly addressing the situation and will act soon totighten export controls.   The arms control chief, William F. Burns, also told senators thatthe Soviet Union is stockpiling biological weapons in violation of a1972 agreement banning them worldwide.   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee, said he is readying a bill to require U.S.diplomatic and economic sanctions against any nation using chemicalor biological weapons. He said the legislation will ask othernations to do likewise.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said he will sponsor companionlegislation to impose sanctions against companies of any nationalitysupplying chemical warfare equipment and technology to Third Worldnations.   ``I have every reason to believe that, in the end, the Congressand the administration will see the wisdom of both approaches,''Helms said.   Burns told the hearing that about 20 nations have the capacity toproduce chemical weapons. He said about five or six are known tohave used or stockpiled them.   Responding to questions, Burns listed Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syriaand North Korea as poison gas stockpilers. He said Iran, Iraq andLibya are reported to have used chemical weapons.   Burns also said the United States believes the Soviet Union ismaintaining stocks of biological weapons in violation of the 1972international agreement outlawing the manufacture and possession ofgerm warfare agents.   ``We believe the Soviet Union does have a stock of biologicalweapons and obviously they must have some capacity to producethem,'' Burns said.   Helms asked how, in that case, the Soviets can be trusted tocomply with a new international agreement, soon to be negotiated,banning the manufacture, stockpiling and use of poison gas and otherchemical weapons.   Burns replied that the 1972 agreement had no provisions formonitoring and verifying compliance while any new pact will haveverification provisions.   He acknowledged, however, that verification will be difficult andthat perfect monitoring probably cannot be achieved.   Helms complained that West German companies were helping ThirdWorld countries, especially in the Middle East, obtain chemicalweapons capability.   He also said a West German company is helping Libya obtain theability to refuel warplanes in flight, extending their range andgiving them the ability to strike Israel.   ``The problem is extremely grim,'' Helms said. ``With thecritical assistance of Western industrial firms, the four mostradical regimes in the world are acquiring weapons of massdestruction.''   Burns, who said he had discussed the situation with officials ofthe West German Embassy, said the attitude of the Bonn governmenthas changed significantly.   ``I think the West German government is on the right track and Iapplaud the activities they are undertaking now,'' Burns said.</TEXT></DOC>
