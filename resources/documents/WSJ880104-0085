The Dryden, Mich., holding company said it would buy the stock from time to time on the open market or in other transactions. All repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock, which may be issued later through employee benefit plans or for acquisitions or used for other purposes.    Champion's chairman, Stanley R. Day, said the company was taking the action because it believes its stock has been selling for about 50% its actual value since the Oct. 19 market crash. &quot;This repurchase program will allow some of that discount to accrue to the benefit of our shareholders,&quot; Mr. Day said.    Champion Enterprises Inc., formerly Champion Home Builders Co., reorganized last June as a holding company. Champion's units manufacture mobile homes, motor homes and medium-duty buses.    Thursday in American Stock Exchange composite trading, Champion closed at $3.25, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
