MARYS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The USS Tennessee, the first of 10 Tridentmissile -firing submarines that will operate from a south Georgiabase, was hailed at an arrival ceremony Sunday as an instrument ofpeace.   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,said the survivability of ballistic missile submarines make them anessential part of the nation's nuclear deterrent force.   Because the vessels operate deep in the ocean in relative safety,leaders would have more time to assess their actions in a crisis,said Nunn, D-Ga.   ``It helps us prevent war by accident and helps us preservepeace,'' said Nunn. ``They don't have to squeeze that nucleartrigger.''   The ceremony was held on a wharf at the Kings Bay Naval SubmarineBase with about 800 guests, including Navy Secretary William BallIII, U.S. Sen. Wyche Fowler of Georgia and U.S. Rep. Lindsay Thomas,whose district includes Kings Bay. Thomas and Fowler are bothDemocrats.   Ball, who has served in the Reagan administration since February,described the Tennessee as the most significant weapons developmentsince the advent of Polaris submarines in 1960.   ``In a very uncertain world of Gadhafis and Khomeinis, and veryunpredictable communist leaders, this is a necessary instrument onbehalf of the national security of our country and the free world,''Fowler said.   While the dignitaries spoke, about 100 anti-nuclear weaponsprotesters demonstrated at the front gate. Navy officials said nineprotesters were arrested, including one in Florida for apparentlytrying to swim toward the approaching submarine.   The Metanoia Community, which coordinated the protest, said up to24 peace groups would be represented during the demonstrations.   Nunn said he respected the views of the protesters, but said that``those in uniform are also dedicated to the cause of peace.''   The Tennessee, an Ohio-class submarine commissioned Dec. 17 inNew London, Conn., is designed to fire the Navy's new Trident IImissiles. The missiles have a range of 6,000 miles and each has upto 10 warheads.   The missile has been undergoing land launching tests at CapeCanaveral, Fla. The Tennessee will be used for the first sealaunches of the new missile.   Tridents are the Navy's largest and most powerful submarines.They are 560 feet long and displace 18,700 tons. Each is equippedwith 24 missiles and staffed with a crew of 157 men.   With a Navy band playing ``Anchors Away'' and gulls and pelicansflying overhead, the Tennessee was nudged into position along awharf by three tugs.</TEXT></DOC>
