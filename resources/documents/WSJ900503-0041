An elderly white-haired man who has spent most ofhis adult life in exile with the African National Congress,here he was watching officials of the ANC and the governmentpose for pictures, standing shoulder to shoulder like oldschoolmates.   &quot;I didn't think I would live to see this,&quot; he said. &quot;It'sa real breakthrough.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   That these two bitter enemies could smile together for thecameras yesterday was remarkable enough. But even moreastonishing, they retreated afterward into an old Cape Dutchhouse for 18 hours of negotiations, scheduled over threedays, aimed at ending racial unrest and normalizing thecountry's politics. The ANC, legalized in February after a30-year ban, demands the lifting of the four-year-old stateof emergency, release of all political prisoners and returnof all exiles. Pretoria wants the ANC to disband itsguerrilla wing and end its armed struggle.   Both sides expressed high hopes for the negotiations,which are aimed at setting the stage for a new constitutionthat would bring equality to the nation's black majority. Butthey also cautioned that in three days, they won't bring downthe pillars of apartheid, or racial segregation, nor come upwith a new dispensation of black-white power sharing.   Pretoria and the ANC remain far apart on their visions fora post-apartheid South Africa: The ANC wants a simpleone-man, one-vote majority rule system, while the governmentclaims that will lead to black domination and insists onconstitutional protection of the rights of minorities,including the whites. Rather, all the delegates agreed, theseinitial meetings should be seen as the first steps down along and rocky road of racial reconciliation and afundamental restructuring of South African society.   &quot;This is the first time in 78 years that a truly seriousmeeting takes place between delegations of the AfricanNational Congress and the succession of white governmentsthat have ruled our country for generations,&quot; said ANC DeputyPresident Nelson Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison beforehis February release. &quot;It indicates the deadly weight of theterrible tradition of a `dialogue' between master and servantwhich we have to overcome.&quot;   All those gathered on the manicured lawns of the GrooteSchuur estate, which has housed people from diamond magnateCecil Rhodes to a series of South African prime ministers,acknowledged history in the making and the great expectationssurrounding it. South African President F.W. de Klerk saidthat government was committed to creating &quot;a new, democraticdispensation,&quot; and that the talks were part of the&quot;irreversible process of normalization&quot; that he began byremoving the ban on 60 political organizations in February.   Mr. Mandela said that to live up to the expectationsbuilding in the black community, the talks &quot;must make adecisive and historic contribution to the repudiation&quot; ofapartheid, which has elevated the white minority to positionsof privilege and denied the black majority basic humanrights. &quot;The black masses of our country,&quot; he warned, &quot;demandand expect fundamental change now -- and not tomorrow.&quot;   Of all the strange bedfellows in political history,yesterday's photo opportunity provided some of the mostamazing pairings. Foreign Minister Pik Botha, famous for hisanti-communist diatribes in the past, stood next to JoeSlovo, the head of South Africa's Communist Party, an ally ofthe ANC. Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok rubbed shoulderswith Ruth Mompati, the ANC's director of administration wholeft two children behind when she fled into exile in 1962.ANC guerrilla commander Joe Modise peered over the head ofKobie Coetsee, the justice minister.   Mr. Mandela even spoke Afrikaans. &quot;The ANC wants to assurethe white community, including the Afrikaners,&quot; he said withconfidence, &quot;that they have nothing to fear from the ANC.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
