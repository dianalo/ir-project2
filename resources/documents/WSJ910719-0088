Amid that standoff over additional funding for the currentfiscal year, Congress pushed ahead on spending legislationfor the coming fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The HouseAppropriations Committee easily approved the last of itsfiscal 1992 bills, sending a $34.4 billion transportationmeasure to the House for action next week. The Senate,meanwhile, passed a $19.26 billion measure for the Treasuryand Postal Service and an $81 billion bill covering housing,veterans and space programs.</LP><TEXT>   The House Appropriations Committee postponed a scheduledvote on its proposed $5.4 billion in supplemental fiscal 1991funds after receiving the veto warning from White HouseBudget Director Richard Darman. He wrote to Chairman JamieWhitten (D., Miss.) that $1.8 billion in disaster aid tofarmers, a personal priority of Mr. Whitten's, was&quot;unwarranted.&quot; Mr. Darman added, &quot;There are many existingprograms which are intended to deal with these localizedproblems.&quot;   Moreover, Mr. Darman said the president wouldn't go alongwith committee leaders' proposals to designate the extradomestic spending as an emergency, making them exempt fromthe spending caps in last fall's bipartisan budget pact.Without that designation, additional spending must be offsetby spending cuts or tax increases. &quot;The president wants toplay Winston Churchill abroad, and Scrooge at home,&quot; snappedRep. David Obey (D., Wis.), a senior Appropriations Committeemember.   President Bush requested $2.9 billion to replace or repairmilitary equipment used in the Persian Gulf conflict, eitherfrom U.S. funds or from a special fund of contributions fromallied countries. According to draft legislation, thecommittee was poised to appropriate $2.8 billion of thatamount, plus $2.6 billion more for both the assistance tofarmers and aid to other victims of recent tornadoes andfloods.   Both the panel's draft and the administration's requestcall for an additional $693 million for the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency. But the administration says that just $151million of that qualifies as an emergency because thedisaster agency's shortfall is partly the result ofCongress's past failure to meet White House requests.   Chairman Whitten is seeking a meeting with the presidentabout their differences. Some committee members favoredtaking a combative all-or-nothing approach, with billlanguage blocking the use of any new funds unless Mr. Bushagreed to the emergency domestic spending. But Mr. Whittenfeared such a showdown would imperil the farmers' aid heseeks.   The flap is just the latest spending dispute to embroilCongress and the administration as they operate under thebudget caps set last year. According to the committee, thepresident this year has agreed to exempt $45.3 billion fromthe spending limits, nearly all of that linked to the GulfWar or aid to foreign nations.   Meanwhile, the Senate voted 91-8 to approve a $19.26billion Treasury and Postal Service measure that would cutmail subsidies and force rate increases for large-envelopemailings by nonprofit organizations. The measure also wouldshift federal operations ranging from the Bureau of thePublic Debt to a new Internal Revenue Service computer centerto West Virginia, the home state of Senate AppropriationsCommittee Chairman Robert Byrd.   In addition, the Senate approved an amendment that wouldimpose prison terms on health-care workers who are infectedwith acquired immune deficiency syndrome and don't informtheir patients of the condition. Another amendment wouldrestrict and monitor the kinds of jobs that medicalprofessionals who have AIDS can hold. The bill now must bereconciled with a House-passed version of the bill thatdoesn't contain similar AIDS provisions.   &quot;I am overwhelmed and terribly upset at what is obviouslypolitics over public health,&quot; said Mervyn Silverman, aphysician and president of the American Foundation for AIDSResearch.   The Senate last night also approved a bill that wouldauthorize the spending of about $81 billion for veterans,housing and other government programs for fiscal 1992. Thebill would preserve about $2 billion in funding for thecontroversial space-station, a pet project of the Bushadministration. Funding for the station also is contained ina similar bill that already has passed the House.</TEXT></DOC>
