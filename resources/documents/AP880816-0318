The six-member civil jury was to resume weighing the evidencetoday.   U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker took about three hours Mondayto instruct the jury on the law. The panel broke off deliberationsabout 4:45 p.m. EDT.   The Hunts are being sued for $150 million by Minpeco SA, whichclaims that the Hunts manipulated world silver prices between 1979and 1980 in a failed attempt to corner the market.   The trial began at federal court in Manhattan in February.   Minpeco, a mineral marketing company owned by the Peruviangovernment, sued the three brothers _ Nelson Bunker Hunt, 62;William Herbert Hunt, 59, who also has extensive real estateholdings; and Lamar Hunt, 56, owner of the National FootballLeague's Kansas City Chiefs _ and several Middle East businessmen.   Lawyers for Minpeco charge that the Hunts and their MiddleEastern co-defendants were responsible for the sharp rise in silverprices from about $9 an ounce to more than $50 an ounce betweenSeptember 1979 and January 1980.   But the Hunts assert they bought silver because of unstableworld political conditions and those conditions, such as the Sovietinvasion of Afghanistan and the seizure of U.S. hostages in Iran,drove up the price of silver.</TEXT></DOC>
