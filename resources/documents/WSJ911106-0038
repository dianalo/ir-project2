Joanne Lesher,a busy attorney, is racing against the 10 o'clock closingtime at her neighborhood Safeway supermarket, trying toseparate the label information about ingredients from themarketing come-ons.   &quot;It's mass confusion,&quot; the 33-year-old shopper complains.&quot;Everything is `light' and `low-fat' and `no-cholesterol.'The terms don't mean what you think they mean. I don't trustthem.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Nor, in fact, does the U.S. government. After months ofsmall steps, the Bush administration this morning willannounce a wide-ranging truth-in-labeling initiative, takinga huge leap toward overhauling the way food is labeled andpromoted in America. Neither grocery shopping nor foodmarketing will ever be the same.   The initiative, involving a score of regulatory proposalscarrying out the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of1990, will trigger the largest product relabeling ever andwill force marketing makeovers for entire lines of foodproducts. Throughout the $280 billion industry, all but thesmallest Mom-and-Pop processors will be required to putuniform nutrition labels on their products, and to followstrict rules for making health claims and touting nutritionalattributes. The objective: Curb hype in the supermarket andhelp consumers make informed purchases.   Currently, only about half of packaged foods on the U.S.market bear nutritional labeling. Under the AgricultureDepartment and Food and Drug Administration proposals,thousands more edibles from ketchup to capers will have tolist calories per serving; amounts of carbohydrates, fat,fiber, protein, sugar and salt per serving; and data onvitamins and minerals.   &quot;Suddenly, you're going to find virtually every food thereis carrying some type of nutritional information,&quot; saysSherwin Gardner of the Grocery Manufacturers of America tradegroup. &quot;That's an enormous change.&quot;   The initiative seeks to curb one of the most commonmarketing devices: manipulation of the &quot;serving size.&quot;Manufacturers will no longer be free to simply shrink aserving size to the point that they can call a product&quot;low-sodium&quot; or &quot;low-calorie.&quot; Instead, food products wouldbe divided into 176 categories, each with a set serving size.Some denounce this as unwarranted meddling in productmarketing, but for consumers, the uniform standards willpermit meaningful comparison shopping.   The proposed rules codify the policies behind FDACommissioner David Kessler's crackdown on promotionalhalf-truths. Manufacturers will be barred from touting aproduct as containing no cholesterol, for example, if it isinherently cholesterol-free -- since it's of vegetable, notanimal, origin -- yet is loaded with fat. &quot;What manufacturersmust understand,&quot; says Dr. Kessler, &quot;is the claims they maketo sell products -- the words they choose to increase marketshare -- are the very same words American consumers use inmaking decisions that affect their health.&quot;   Many of the proposed labeling changes will be challengedby segments of the industry during a one-year comment period.Teams of corporate lawyers, marketing executives andnutritionists are being assembled to pore over the mammothregulatory package, which is expected to run 700 pages in theFederal Register. Companies are abuzz with speculation aboutthe potential impact on their product lines and market niches-- and on their corporate rivals.   Will Stouffer Foods Corp.'s recently reformulated LeanCuisine frozen entrees be lean enough to pass muster? Whatstance will regulators take on health claims implicit intrademarks and brand names, such as ConAgra Inc.'s HealthyChoice and Campbell Soup Co.'s Healthy Request?Representatives of the three companies say it's too early tocomment.   The proposed rules will put a premium on development ofmore nutritious foods and give food scientists greater say.Many in the industry anticipate a wave of productreformulations well in advance of May 1993, the rules'effective date. Countless companies will need to revampmarketing and ad strategies as they adjust and repositionproducts.   &quot;The government is going to demystify things,&quot; says TomPirko, a Los Angeles food and beverage consultant. Formarketers, the challenge will be immense. &quot;It's very hard todescribe a product fairly and accurately and still make itsaleable,&quot; he asserts.   The initiative is extraordinary in other respects. For thefirst time, the FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture,overseer of meat and poultry, are working in concert onlabeling. To a great extent, the USDA proposals will mirrorthe FDA's. The result could be a more level playing field onwhich meat and poultry processors won't have an edge overFDA-regulated manufacturers. And consumers, if they wish,could make valid nutritional comparisons betweenUSDA-inspected pepperoni pizza and FDA-regulated cheesepizza, or between turkey and tuna.   The revolution in labeling is chiefly the work ofAgriculture Secretary Edward Madigan, a former Republicancongressman from Illinois, and Health and Human ServicesSecretary Louis Sullivan. Mr. Madigan co-sponsored and helpedshepherd through Congress the nutrition labeling law that Dr.Sullivan's FDA staff is now carrying out. Once at the USDA,he jawboned meat and poultry processors into acceptingmandatory nutrition labeling.   The FDA-USDA initiative has strong White House support,notwithstanding the misgivings of the Office of Managementand Budget and Vice President Dan Quayle's Council onCompetitiveness about its economic impact, notably on smallbusiness.   Many in industry also aren't happy with parts of theinitiative. The Sugar Association lobbied in vain to keep itsproduct from being listed on the nutrition label, arguingthat it is consumed in moderation and doesn't cause anyhealth problems besides tooth decay. And several trade groupsobject to the serving-size rules, which are based on portionscustomarily consumed by an average person over age four. Theservings must be calculated in common household measures,such as cups, tablespoons and ounces, as well as metricmeasures, such as milligrams and grams.   The Grocery Manufacturers trade group contends that thegovernment should set criteria for serving sizes, not theserving sizes themselves. &quot;Serving-size rules have to beconsumer-friendly,&quot; says Manly Molpus, president of thegroup. &quot;If they don't relate to the way people eat food, theyare going to be meaningless.&quot;   The regulators decided any package containing less thantwo servings will be considered a single-serving container, amove likely to hit the beverage industry particularly hard.The proposed serving size for soft drinks -- eight ounces --would keep Coca-Cola Co. from breaking its 12-ounce can ofDiet Coke into two servings, putting the beverage above thethreshold of &quot;very low&quot; sodium.   Dairy processors are angry about the proposedone-tablespoon serving size for butter. For years, theindustry standard has been one teaspoon, or about one butterpat. Regulators say that doesn't reflect how much consumerstypically eat. &quot;It fouls us up from a marketing standpoint,&quot;says Jerome Kozak, vice president of the International DairyFoods Association.   The Council on Competitiveness staff has raised suchconcerns with FDA and USDA officials, and won pledges thatthe agencies will try to avoid unduly cramping marketingefforts. To this end, the USDA is planning a specialaccommodation for the meat and poultry industry whoseproducts won't meet the proposed definition of low fat. Thedepartment's Food Safety and Inspection Service will proposeletting processors describe meat and poultry products andfresh cuts of meat and poultry as &quot;lean&quot; if they contain nomore than 10% fat. Processed and fresh meat and poultrycontaining no more than 5% fat could be sold as &quot;extra lean.&quot;   Consumer advocates, while praising most of the labelinginitiative, say the regulators appear poised to bestow toogreat a break on the meat and poultry industry. The proposedserving size for meat, poultry and fish will be notably small-- three ounces, far less than the typical amount a consumereats at a sitting, according to diet surveys. &quot;I don'tremember ever going to a restaurant and seeing a three-ouncesteak on the menu,&quot; says Bruce Silverglade, attorney for theCenter for Science in the Public Interest.   He and others are also troubled by the plan to treat meator poultry TV dinners and other frozen entrees as a singleserving, and to let them be labeled lean or extra lean. &quot;Theonly thing lean in some entrees is the meat,&quot; Mr. Silvergladesays.   Under current nutrition labeling law, food companies can'tuse such terms as &quot;lite&quot; or &quot;low-calorie&quot; unless the FDAdefines them. Along with the USDA, the agency will proposetoday a dictionary of more than 20 so-called &quot;descriptors&quot;for food producers, retailers and consumers to consult. Atthe Council on Competitiveness's urging, the FDA agreed toconsider adding other terms, such as &quot;very high,&quot; as well asto allow use of certain synonyms that might enhance foods'appeal.   The dictionary, if adopted as expected, promises to havewidespread repercussions in the marketplace. In Petaluma,Calif., for example, British cereal maker Weetabix'sBarbara's Bakery Inc. unit would have to drop a freshnessclaim because its granola is thermally processed and, bydefinition, not &quot;fresh.&quot; And Louis Rich Co. of Madison, Wis.,would have to stop calling its turkey franks &quot;80% fat-free&quot;because the product won't meet the proposed definition for&quot;low fat.&quot;   Regulators intend to impose even more stringentrestrictions on the use of health messages that link certainfood nutrients to health conditions or diseases. Suchmessages came into vogue in the late 1980s as cerealcompanies and makers of dietary supplements led the rush tocash in on diet fads and health concerns. Frequently, theacclaimed benefits haven't been supported by scientificevidence.   The FDA, as directed by Congress, has reviewed 10 healthmessages in particular, and decided there is significantscientific agreement on the validity of only four. The agencywill propose letting companies continue to promote certainhigh-calcium foods as helping to prevent osteoporosis in theelderly, and certain low-sodium foods as helping to curbhypertension. Companies also could continue making healthclaims linking fat to heart disease and cancer.   The FDA intends to reject four messages -- about purportedbenefits of folic acid, antioxidant vitamins, zinc andomega-3 fatty acids -- while reserving judgment on dietaryfiber. Though the agency has challenged cereal makers andothers on fiber claims and questioned the safety of addingfibrous psyllium to cereal, it will seek more data on fiber'spossible role in reducing the risk of heart disease andcancer.   If the FDA concludes there isn't significant agreement onthe health benefits of fiber, Middle East Bakery Inc. ofMethuen, Mass., among others, will have to stop claiming thatits oat-bran pita bread &quot;can help reduce cholesterol.&quot; JohnBoghos, vice president of the family-owned business, says heunderstands that fiber helps reduce the likelihood ofdeveloping heart disease.   &quot;When all of the requirements are finalized, nearly everyfood company will have to change nearly every label, onnearly every food product,&quot; says an executive at one majorfood company.   The stakes are particularly high for Kraft General Foods,a unit of Philip Morris Cos. and the nation's largest foodprocessor. Its &quot;fat-free&quot; products, from salad dressings toprocessed cheese foods, ring up annual sales of about $450million. Once the company has had a chance to review the newrules, it may have to reformulate some products or changetheir labels.   Whatever the case, many marketers have already grown moresavvy about avoiding the FDA's wrath. Campbell Soup's newHealthy Request soups each contain as much as 500 milligramsof sodium per serving -- far above the FDA's proposeddefinition of &quot;low-sodium.&quot; But the company doesn't claim thesoups are low in sodium. Instead, it compares the HealthyRequest varieties to its regular line of soups, which have ahigher sodium content.   The nation's nutrition labels haven't changedsubstantially since 1973, when the government began requiringfood processors to put them on products that bear a nutritionclaim or are fortified with protein, vitamins and minerals.Currently, nutrition labeling covers only 40% of the meat andpoultry products and 60% of the other packaged foods on themarket.   Separate from this latest initiative, the FDA last summerproposed regulations that will revamp how ingredients arelisted on packages and how fruit and vegetable juices arelabeled. Last summer, the agency also proposed a set ofguidelines for voluntary nutrition labeling by supermarketsof fish, seafood and fresh produce. If the supermarkets balkat posting nutrition information, Congress has directed theagency to turn the voluntary program into a mandatory one,conceivably as early as the spring of 1994. The FDA is stillreviewing industry and consumer comment on the proposals.   Agriculture Department officials say they will follow theFDA's lead on ingredient listing and will launch a similarvoluntary labeling program for fresh meat and poultry. If 60%of the retailers aren't participating in the program, theUSDA is threatening to make it mandatory.   Before the revolution in labeling is over, the industrywill spend as much as $2.8 billion on new labels and otherexpenses. The FDA estimates that the roughly 17,000 companiesit regulates will have to change 257,000 labels -- a grossunderestimate, according to industry officials. Asmall-business exemption will spare companies with less than$500,000 in annual sales from the expense. The governmentestimates that the benefits to the public over 20 years wouldinclude $100 billion in reduced health-care costs.   ---   Kathleen Deveny contributed to this article.   ---                     THE NEW FOODSPEAK                                                                                                          Some definitions of label terms, to be proposed by theAgriculture Department and the Food and Drug Administration.
