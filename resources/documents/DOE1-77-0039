<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-77-0039 </DOCNO><TEXT>It is possible to measure the deep-inelastic spin-dependent structurefunctions g{sub 1}/sup p/(x) and g{sub 1}/sup n/(x) for the proton andneutron using internal polarized hydrogen, deuterium, and {sup 3}He targetsof polarization 50% and thickness 10{sup 14} to 10{sup 15} cm{sup -2}and the 60 mA longitudinally polarized 30 GeV electron beam in the HERAelectron storage ring. The measurement of the deep-inelastic spin-structureof both isospin states of the nucleon at the same kinematics and usingthe same apparatus allows the Bjorken sum rule to be experimentally checked.In addition, it uniquely constrains the spin distribution of the u andd quarks as a function of x in any model of the nucleon. Possible targetand detector configurations are described and an estimate of the accuracyof such a measurement is presented.</TEXT></DOC>
