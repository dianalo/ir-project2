The company employed 300 production and 100 indirectworkers on a single daily shift. Formerly the factory was manufacturingpants, but it was converting to the manufacture of outer shirts madefrom polyesters, rayons, and cotton-blended fabrics at the time of thesurvey. There was no medical program and industrial hygiene, and safetyprograms were handled at the divisional levels. No physician, nurse,or clinic was provided, health information for new employees was regularlyrecorded, and they were required to take a medical examination. Noiselevels ranged from 72 to 93 decibels. Illumination levels in sewing areaswere 42 footcandles (fc) and auxiliary illumination on sewing machineswas 300 fc. Airborne-dust concentrations were 0.11 milligrams per cubicmeter (mg/CuM) with fiber diameters ranging from 3 to 20 microns. Thefiber length was 727 microns. No chemicals or solvents were used. Theauthor notes that workers exposed to 85 decibels or more for over 8 hoursmust have routine audiograms under the proposed OSHA standards. Theyrecommended the use of safety glasses of optical quality to replace plasticeye shields on the button sewing machines and pulmonary-function testsfor workers exposed to dusts from chemically treated fabrics.</TEXT></DOC>
