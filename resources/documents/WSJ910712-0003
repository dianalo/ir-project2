The Federal Communications Commission voted, 5-0, to studythe entire video marketplace with an eye toward updating itspolicies. The action followed a staff report issued late lastmonth that raised serious concerns about the future ofbroadcast TV as more and more viewers are signing up forcable and other multichannel video offerings such asmicrowave and satellite services.</LP><TEXT>   Commissioner James Quello called the review &quot;a much neededopportunity to look at a broad range of policies to determinewhich ones are still needed, which ones are not, and whichones are counterproductive in terms of the public interest.&quot;Chairman Alfred Sikes asserted that it was &quot;cruciallyimportant that our rules be reality-based.&quot; The staff report,he added, &quot;certainly challenges some of the underpinnings ofthose rules.&quot;   The agency isn't likely to propose any major changes formonths, however, and then it may be a year or more beforecommissioners are ready to vote on specific policy changes.The general idea is to ensure that FCC policies and rulespromote diversity in programming and public-interestconcerns.   While few expressed reservations about studying theindustry, making any substantive changes will likely becontentious. Eliminating ownership restrictions, for example,is certain to raise questions about diversity of ownershipand variety in programming, as well as to raise the ire oflawmakers.   The commission said it would examine increasingcompetition, technological improvements such as signalcompression, rapid growth in national sources of programmingand the ability of broadcast TV's competitors to tap tworevenue streams-payments from subscribers and advertisers.   The commission staff concluded that broadcast television&quot;has suffered an irreversible long-term decline in audienceand revenue shares which will continue through the currentdecade.&quot; It advocated eliminating rules that prevent acorporation or individual from owning more than 12 TVstations, that prohibit common ownership of stations thatserve overlapping markets, and that bar the networks fromowning cable operations.   The staff report also recommended reviewing other TVrules, including those governing the networks' relationshipwith affiliates and those permitting cable operators to pickup local broadcast signals and retransmit them at little orno cost.   The National Association of Broadcasters, which representsa wide range of broadcasters, said it was eager to spell outits views on video compression's impact on the future offree, over-the-air TV. Compression technology, which wouldallow four to six signals to be crammed into a TV station'scurrent frequency, could allow broadcasters to becomemultichannel video providers if the FCC allows existinglicensees to use the new-found capacity to deliver videoprogramming. But if the FCC views the additional capacity asnewly freed spectrum and limits broadcasters to one station,they could be at a disadvantage, especially as cable andother competitors deploy compression technology, according toJeff Baumann, the NAB's general counsel.   In addition, Mr. Baumann said the NAB would continue topush for rules requiring cable companies to carry a certainnumber of local broadcast signals, as well as for legislationallowing broadcasters to negotiate for payment or otherconsideration if cable systems carry their signals.</TEXT></DOC>
