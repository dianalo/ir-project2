Two people were reported missing andat least four were hurt.   Philippine Red Cross officials said four children were among thedead in Malita, including a 9-day-old baby who drowned when a housewas swept by floodwaters.   Another infant was accidentally crushed to death by his motheras she tried to clasp her arms around a tree as the tornado passed.
