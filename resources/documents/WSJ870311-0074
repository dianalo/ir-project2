First Security Savings andamp; Loan, Grand Junction, Colo., was merged into Great American First Savings Bank, Tucson, Ariz. First Security, a federally chartered mutual association with assets of $54 million, was the successor to a state-chartered association that was closed by state regulators and placed in the Bank Board's control in November.    Great American First is a federally chartered stock association with $2.9 billion in assets and a unit of Great American First Savings Bank, San Diego. The acquisition marks Great American's entry into the retail banking business in Colorado. Great American currently operates retail branches in California and Arizona.    To facilitate the transaction, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will indemnify Great American First against undisclosed liabilities and possible litigation resulting from the merger. </TEXT></DOC>
