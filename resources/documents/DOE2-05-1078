<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-05-1078 </DOCNO><TEXT>Measurements on air trapped in old polar ice have revealed that the pre-industrialatmosphere contained 280 ppm of CO/sub 2/ and that {delta}/sup 13/C ofatmospheric CO/sub 2/ decreased by about 1.1 permille until 1980. Thesemeasurements show that considerable amounts of non-fossil CO/sub 2/ musthave already been emitted into the atmosphere in the 19th century. Quantitativeestimates of the emission rates were performed by deconvolving the CO/sub2/ and {delta}/sup 13/C records, using models of the global carbon cycle(box-diffusion and outcrop-diffusion ocean, four-box biosphere). Dependingon the structure of the ocean submodel, deconvolution of the CO/sub 2/record yields a cumulative non-fossil production of about 90 to 150 GtC until 1980, of which more than 50% were released prior to 1900. Accordingto the model results, the net non-fossil production rate was roughlyconstant in the 19th and the first part of the 20th century. In the past30 years, smaller values are obtained (0-0.9 Gt C yr/sup -1/) which areat the lower limit or below current ecological estimates for deforestationand land use (1.6 +- 0.8 Gt C yr/sup -1/). The difference might possiblybe due to other sinks, e.g., stimulation of plant productivity by theenhanced CO/sub 2/ concentration. Calculated /sup 13/C and /sup 14/Ctime histories agree well with the observed changes. While the changeof the atmospheric CO/sub 2/ concentration reflects more the cumulativecarbon release, the isotope concentrations are more sensitive to short-termchanges of the emission rate. The reason is that the oceanic uptake capacityis smaller for excess CO/sub 2/ by the buffer factor of {similar_to}10 than for an isotopic perturbation. (authors).</TEXT></DOC>
