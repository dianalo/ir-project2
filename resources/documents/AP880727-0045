The kingdom, a longtime U.S. customer, has been prevented frombuying some American sophisticated weapons because of thepro-Israeli lobby in Washington, which has claimed the sales wouldthreaten Israel's security.   Sales agreements this year reportedly could make Britain the No.1 arms supplier for Saudi Arabia, replacing the United States.   Fahd's statement was the most direct indication Saudi Arabiawill consider buying arms from the Soviet bloc and China despitethe absence of diplomatic ties between the Islamic kingdom and whatit considers atheistic countries.   Saudi Arabia, in the first step of its kind with a communistnation, has acquired medium-range missiles from China in a dealnegotiated over two years, according to reports earlier this yearby U.S. intelligence agencies.   Fahd made the declaration in an address Monday night to armyofficers in the holy city of Mecca for the annual pilgrimage knownas the hajj and the four-day Moslem feast of Eid al-Adha.</TEXT></DOC>
