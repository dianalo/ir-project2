By a 9-0 vote, the high court upheld the constitutionalityof a 1986 federal law that said the approval of a state'sgovernor isn't required for the president to send the Guardabroad.</LP><TEXT>   The 1986 law was challenged by the governors of Minnesotaand Massachusetts in separate lawsuits objecting to the useof the Guard for training missions in Central America. Theobjections that Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis voicedconcerning this use of the Guard were raised as a campaignissue by some opponents in the 1988 Democratic presidentialprimaries, who tried to make him appear weak on nationalsecurity.   Prior to 1986, federal law required that a state'sgovernor approve calls to active training, but the 1986amendment deleted the governor's authority. The two stateofficials argued that the amendment violated a provision ofthe Constitution that leaves it to the states to mobilize andtrain the &quot;militia.&quot;   A federal appeals court in Boston rejected theMassachusetts' claim; a federal appeals court in St. Louis atfirst ruled in the Minnesota case that the 1986 amendment wasunconstitutional, but then reversed itself.   In an opinion written by Justice John Stevens, the highcourt said the Constitution clearly gives Congress the powerto order the National Guard to active duty without approvalof state officials.

The decision willmake it tougher for lawyers to win on appeal of their fines.   In an opinion written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, thecourt ruled that appeals courts should reverse fines imposedon lawyers only if the judge &quot;abused his discretion.&quot; This islegal terminology for a lenient standard that gives districtjudges wide leeway.   The decision involved what is known as Rule 11 of theprocedures governing civil lawsuits in federal court. Adoptedin 1938, the rule was amended in 1983 to give judges theauthority to impose sanctions on lawyers to discourage thefiling of frivolous cases.   The justices resolved three issues. First, they ruled thata plaintiff's decision to get their lawsuit dismissed doesn'tpreclude a federal judge from considering whether to imposesanctions on the lawyer. Second, the justices said theappeals courts should defer to district judges in such cases.Finally, the high court said lawyers who appeal Rule 11sanctions can't be penalized further by having to pay thewinner's legal fees for the appeal.   The high court ruling is a defeat for Cooter andamp; Gell, aWashington law firm that was engaged in a long legal battleon behalf of a competitor of Hartmarx Corp. A federaldistrict court ordered the law firm to pay $21,452 andrequired the competitor, Danik Inc., to pay $10,701. (Cooterandamp; Gell vs. Hartmarx Corp.)                                                                                                          State Taxes                                                                                                          Just a week after deciding two state tax cases that tiedthe high court in knots for two years, the justices agreed tohear two more challenges to state business taxes, one inFlorida, the other in Georgia.   In one case, the court agreed to hear a challenge by JamesB. Beam Distilling Co. to a Georgia liquor tax that thecompany paid from 1982 through 1984. The tax was amended in1985, but the company sued for a refund of $2.4 million ithad already paid. The company said the tax discriminated bycharging higher rates on liquor manufactured in other statesand imported into Georgia.   The Georgia Supreme Court ruled that the tax before 1985was unconstitutional since it directly interfered withinterstate commerce. But the state court, saying that Beamwasn't entitled to a refund, said the ruling applied only tofuture cases.   Last week, in a Florida case, the justices ruled thatstates must give taxpayers relief if their taxes are ruledretroactively unconstitutional. But the court was deeplydivided about when such rulings should be retroactive. TheBeam case gives the court another chance to clarify whendecisions that taxes are unconstitutional should be appliedretroactively. (James B. Beam Distilling Co. vs. Georgia)   In the other case, Ford Motor Co.'s financing unit, FordMotor Credit Co., challenged a tax assessment by the state ofFlorida of $2 million including penalties and interest for1980 through 1982.   The Florida tax is imposed on intangible property. In thiscase, the tax was imposed on the value of outstanding carloans extended by Ford and owed by Florida residents for carsmanufactured in other states and shipped to Florida.   The company argued that the tax was imposed in a way thatwould expose the same property to multiple taxation byFlorida and other states where the company does business. Thecompany argued that this is unconstitutional.   But a Florida appeals court upheld the tax. The appealscourt said that the U.S. Supreme Court has never said theConstitution prohibits this risk of overlapping taxation whenit comes to property taxes.   Yesterday, the justices agreed to hear Ford's appeal.(Ford Motor Credit Co. vs. Florida)</TEXT></DOC>
