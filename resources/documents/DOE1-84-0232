In vivo experiments on 20 healthyvolunteers show in SSEP registrations as well as in VEP-registrationsno measurable influence on nerve conduction. The measured latencies beforeand after MR imaging are found inside the standard values which are validfor healthy volunteers. In vivo experiments at field-strengths up to1.0 Tesla show no significant changes of the central and peripheral conductionvelocity with human beings.</TEXT></DOC>
