In the hypothalmus, thelabelling was particularly high in the paraventricular nucleus (siteof CRF synthesis), the arcuate, periventricular and the supraoptic nucleias well as in the median eminence. Autoradiograms also revealed the presenceof[/sup 3/H]RU 28362 binding sites in several brain regions includingthe amygdala, the pineal gland, the entorhinal cortex, the interpeduncular,interfascicular and dorsal raphe nuclei, the central grey and the substantianigra suggesting possible effects of glucocorticosteriods in these structures</TEXT></DOC>
