 The Wall StreetJournal fired first.andP;  It took the New York Times a whole day to respond.andO;Since then, each side has attacked whenever it has found anything remotelyresembling ammunition.andP;  So far there have been no casualties.andP;  This isunusual, considering it is a nuclear war.andP;  The fight broke out in an articleby Jerry Bishop, a journalist who was willing to go all the way to Salt LakeCity, Utah...andP;  or at least phone there.andP;  At the University of Utah, Bishopreported, two scientists achieved &quot;a sustained thermonuclear reaction at roomtemperature.&quot;andP;  This was pretty big news.andP;  We had a car that couldn't setgasoline on fire at room temperature.andP;  Experts we consulted, including MrsFrances Brady of Omaha, Nebraska, asserted that somewhat more subtlereactions, including those required to make a decent souffle, must take placeat temperatures in excess of 375o Fahrenheit, or 191o Celsius.andP;  So coldfusion was quite a neat trick.andP;  No newspaper prides itself on its coverage ofscientific developments more than the New York Times.andP;  Getting scooped by arival, however worthy, smarted.andP;  The Times struck back in its next edition,but unfortunately by that time the U of U had handed the story to every fishwrapper from Provo to Provincetown.andP;  In its carefully-worded piece, it dulyreported all the representations of the fusion scientists, but injected alarge measure of the authoritative scepticism for which it is so justlyfamed.andM;Gullible ragandM;The implication was clear: the Journal may have gotten the storyandM;first, but it was a gullible rag.andP;  Maybe, the Times contended, and kept oncontending in subsequent articles, something important happened...andP;  but maybenot.andP;  In any event, the papers' disagreement remains one that isn't likely tobe decided tomorrow, giving both great organs a chance to change their tunes.andO;If only IBM had it as easy as the scientists.andP;  Their reputations depend onwhich paper they read; most any day, they  can find succour in the Journal orscorn in the Times.andP;  They may not know where they stand, but at least theycan identify the partisans.andP;  IBM, by contrast, gets to read about its brightfuture one day and dim prospects another no matter which paper it first picksoff the doorstep in Armonk.andP;  Last month, Times business reporter John Markoffsaid IBM's mainframe business was in jeopardy and with it the company's fatprofits.andP;  The version of the story that ran in the Times' offspring, theInternational Herald-Tribune went so far as to caption a photo of a 3090mainframe &quot;Portrait of a Dinosaur&quot; (CI No 1,151).andP;  Last week, Mr Markoffreversed himself, asserting that IBM's future was secure and with it thecompany's newsworthy pat prophets.andP;  He pointed out, no doubt with the help ofsome investor relations experts and of course without the influence of hisemployer's director, IBM chairman Mr John Akers, that IBM was driven byoptimism generously to raise its quarterly dividend.andP;  Every intelligentinvestor who paid $115 a share will now be rewarded with an extra 11 cents.andM;By Hesh WienerandM;Mind you, this isn't one-time largesse.andP;  Shareholders will getandM;$1.21 every quarter if business holds up, which the Times assures us is morelikely to occur than a neutron party in Utah.andP;  For its part, The Wall StreetJournal has been deadpan, informing its readers with equanimity about IBM'sdoings, such as the manufacturer's insistence that Mr Akers take home$1,525,500 as his compensation for 1988's accomplishments, an increase of$259,604.andP;  Mr Akers got his raise the hard way.andP;  Had he been an indolentsort, he could have avoided toiling for that boost by simply buying 590,009IBM shares (for a mere $67.85m) and waiting for his dividend cheque togrow...andP;  or sitting in front of his Prodigy terminal reading the Dow Jonesnews and playing the palladium market.andP;  Mr Akers and everyone in his salesforce knows that IBM's business is in part a game of confidence.andP;  Customers'hypotheses about the future can be self-fulfilling.andP;  There is a great dealmore to this than mere crowd psychology.andP;  A lot of 1applications areimplemented to give user companies a competitive advantage.andP;  When one firm ina market slacks off, others are tempted to take a breather; when many slowdown, all may.andP;  So the flavour of the news helps make or break IBM.andP;  Nowonder IBM's image is a daily concern for the company's shareholders andemployees.andP;  It's a full-time worry and then some for the corporation's spindoctors.andP;  And it's a problem for users, too, but one of a different kind.andP;  NoVPDP wants to be called on the carpet by a superior who has read that thecomputer business is in a slump the very day the proposal for the newmainframe complex went upstairs.andP;  Nor does the information systems executivewant to be asked why his company isn't keeping up with a competitor's newon-line system, particularly if the enemy's application has just been toutedin the press as the reason it is gaining market share.andP;  There is a limit toour VPDP's independence from the environment, however inconvenient that mightbe.andP;  And what he can find out about the climate in his vicinity isn'tnecessarily correct.andP;  Most likely its an account of conditions no moretrustworthy than the newspaper reports of the Utah fusion experiments...andP;  orIBM's predictions about its prospects for next year.andM;Down the drainandM;While IBM doesn't get confused by its own images, Mr Akers doesandM;suffer from incomplete information about customers and a surplus of detailson his company.andP;  His bean-counters, endlessly tallying up IBM's numbers ontheir terminals, can tell him everything there is to know about the company'spast, present and booked future business.andP;  But all the economists in theworld can't help him predict exactly the way his customers will act.andP;  MrAkers must conduct his affairs on the basis of highly educated guesses, justlike everyone else.andP;  If he has better guesses, he also has more at stake.andP;  Wesuspect Mr Akers, in the solitude of his office, is as deeply troubled byignorance as he could be.andP;  If anything, he is probably more worried at timesthan any of his customers.andP;  His company's clout makes it even harder to get aclear reflection in the media.andP;  The press is fully as reluctant to go out ona limb with unusually good news on IBM as it is to run a potentially damagingstory.andP;  So a user that bases plans on IBM's apparent posture or, worse, onthe brave statements that have been passed along by corporate spokesfolk isassuming a poorly-delineated risk.andP;  Sometimes the danger is not worthworrying about because all the signs point in the same direction.andP;  Those arethe easy seasons.andP;  This is not one of them.andP;  Despite great gobs of evidencethat the economy is chugging along nicely and a plethora of reassuringstatements from authorities high and low, things don't seem very secure.andP;  Notto IBM, at least.andP;  It has been frantically trying to push its iron.andP;  It isbehaving as if Mr Akers and his most trusted advis-ors think their businessis suddenly going to go down the drain, just like the heavy water that may bereacting at room temperature in Utah.andP;  IBM, too has fusion problems: aprofusion of facts and a confusion of purpose.andM;(C) 1989 Technology News of America</TEXT></DOC>
