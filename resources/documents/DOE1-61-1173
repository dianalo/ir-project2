The overwhelming and inaccurate rumorswhich anti-nuke activists spread greatly hamper efforts to prepare thenation, or even individual families, to meet the challenges of the postwarperiod. Doomie myths convince people that survival is impossible andpeople who are taken in by them simply won't make survival preparations.Because of the myths, these misled believers may very well die in thewar or its aftermath even though they could have been saved.
