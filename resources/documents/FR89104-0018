This rulemodifies the regulations contained in Parts 10, 12, 15, 30, 31, 35, 151,and 185 of Title 46 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and Part 155 of Title33 CFR concerning the licensing of individuals, the registration of staffofficers, and the manning of vessels. This final rule combines and modifiesthe regulations contained in rulemaking dockets CGD 81-059 and CGD 81-059bpublished as Interim Final Rules on October 16, 1987 (52 FR 38614 and 52FR 38658, respectively). New limited tonnage licenses are added for GreatLakes and inland service. Provision is made for master and mate licenseswith a river route. The renewal requirements are modified to allow licenserenewal by mariners who are not actively employed under the authority oftheir licenses. The license renewal requirement for a valid cardiopulmonaryresuscitation course certificate has been withdrawn. The authority formasters and mates to act as tankerman, which appears throughout 46 CFRand in 33 CFR Part 155, is modified to reflect the broader use of the termsmaster and mate. The list of examination subjects for engineering licenseshas been completely revised to more clearly indicate the material coveredin each examination. Minor modifications to the topics for deck licenseshave also been made.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>These changes to the regulations are effectiveFebruary 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>LCDR Gerald D.

TheCoast Guard received approximately 75 written comments to the docket onthat ANPRM. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was published on August8, 1983 (48 FR 35920). Over 10,000 copies of this notice were mailed outto the public and 19 public meetings were held around the country. Thisnotice elicited over 700 written comments and thousands of telephone inquiries.A Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) was published on October24, 1985 (50 FR 43316), after which the Coast Guard held six public hearings.On October 16, 1987, an Interim Final Rule (IFR) was published (52 FR 38614).Ten thousand reprints of this IFR were distributed to interested parties.While the majority of the regulations became effective December 1, 1987,the IFR provided for an additional 90 day comment period. Since 1981, atotal of over 1490 written comments have been received and docketed onthis project. Comments received in response to the IFR, and changes reflectedin the final rule, are discussed later in this preamble. The Coast Guardalso published an Interim Final Rule on October 16, 1987 (52 FR 38658)which reformatted and reorganized the regulatory requirements for pilots'licenses to make them consistent with the remainder of the licensing regulations(CGD 81-059b). Four comments were received and have been addressed in thepreamble. No changes have been made to that rulemaking. The comments receivedin response to the Interim Final Rule on the licensing and manning regulationsfor mobile offshore drilling units (CGD 81-059a, 52 FR 38660), also publishedon October 16, 1987, are still being evaluated, and a final rule will bepublished at a later date.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal drafters of this Final Rule are: LCDR Gerald D. Jenkins,Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environment Protection, and CDR GeraldA. Gallion, Office of Chief Counsel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>This final rule implements the provisions of Pub. L. 96-378 and the Portand Tanker Safety Act of 1978. Pub. L. 96-378 discussed the establishmentof career patterns, service and qualifying requirements, and the substitutionof training time and courses of instruction for sea service. The Port andTanker Safety Act of 1978 required improved pilotage standards, standardsrelating to qualification for licenses by the use of simulators, minimumhealth and physical fitness criteria, and periodic retraining and specialtraining for upgrading positions.The structure and basic qualifications for licenses have been designedto conform to the provisions of the International Convention on the Standardsof Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978.While the United States has not yet ratified this Convention, the UnitedStates delegation was an active participant in the drafting of the Conventionand has participated in ensuing interpretations of the Convention. TheConvention has been ratified by a sufficient number of maritime nations,and entered into force internationally in April, 1984. Having the structureand basic qualifications of licenses issued by the Coast Guard in generalconformance with the Convention will facilitate their acceptance by thecountries that have ratified the STCW.Public Law 98-89 of August 20, 1983, revised and consolidated certain lawsrelating to vessels and merchant seamen contained in Title 46, United StatesCode. These changes also necessitated some amendments to the licensingand manning regulations.For some time the Coast Guard had planned to revise the licensing and manningregulations due to their complexity. This final rule maintains the highU.S. mariner licensing standards while simplifying the license structureand making the regulations easier to use.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>The comments received were generally supportive of the regulations publishedin the Interim Final Rule. Specific areas which received substantive commentsor are modified based on Coast Guard experience under the interim rulesare discussed in the same format presented in the preamble to the SupplementalNotice and the Interim Final Rule. This final rule was prepared after consideringall comments received.Specific Comment Areas1. <T3>Professional requirements for license renewal: </T3>There were 97 commentsobjecting to the service, training or examination requirements for therenewal of a license. The regulations provide four options whereby a marinercan demonstrate continuing proficiency. The flexibility provided by theseoptions will allow nearly all mariners to renew their licenses. This portionof the regulations is virtually unchanged from the 1985 Supplemental Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking.The requirements for renewal contained in this rulemaking are in keepingwith the provisions of the International Convention on Standards of Training,Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978 (STCW). Although theUnited States is not signatory to the Convention, it has been ratifiedby sufficient maritime nations and came into force on April 28, 1984.Consequently, in order for U.S. licenses to be accepted by nations signatoryto STCW and for U.S. vessels to operate in foreign ports without impediment,it is necessary that our regulations substantially comply with the provisionsof the Convention. Regulations II/5 and III/5 of the Annex to STCW setthe ``mandatory minimum requirements to ensure the continued proficiencyand up-dating of knowledge'' for deck and engineering officers. These provisionsin STCW and the renewal requirements in the final rule are essentiallythe same.The Final Rule does provide a means by which a mariner can continue torenew a license without satisfying these professional requirements (paragraph2).2. <T3>Two-tier license renewal structure: </T3>To satisfy the intent of theInternational Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeepingfor Seafarers, 1978 (STCW) regulations II/5 and III/5, which require administrationsto ``ensure continued proficiency'' of merchant marine officers, the revisionto Part 10 placed some additional requirements on applicants for licenserenewal. Mariners not currently sailing or employed in a related industryhave expressed concern about their ability to meet the new requirementslisted in 46 CFR 10.209(c). To allay such concerns, and to maintain a largepool of licensed mariners for national security reasons, a two-tier licenserenewal system is being implemented with the final rule. Under the two-tierstructure, applicants that cannot meet, or elect not to meet, the professionalrequirements of andSection; 10.209(c) may renew their licenses by followingthe procedure detailed in 46 CFR 10.209(g). Any license renewed under paragraph(g) is endorsed to prohibit service under the authority of the licenseuntil all of the renewal requiremetns of andSection; 10.209 are met.3. <T3>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation training: </T3>There were 39 commentsobjecting to the requirement for possession of a valid cardiopulmonaryresuscitation (CPR) course certificate in order to renew a license. Certificationin CPR has been a requirement for original license issuance for a numberof years. Until publication in the Interim Final Rule, the requirementfor CPR training has been well supported by comments on this rulemaking,with several recommending adoption as a renewal requirement. Since theInterim Rule was published, several comments challenged the wisdom of abandoningthe safe navigation of the vessel in order to administer CPR. It is notexpected that a licensed mariner will abandon the safe navigation of avessel in order to administer CPR or other forms of first aid. However,circumstances are likely in which the vessel could be safely moored, ormore than one qualified mariner would be onboard and available to provideassistance.In view of the comments received, the requirements for a valid CPR cardfor license renewal is withdrawn. However, the requirement for a validCPR card for an original license will be retained. The Coast Guard considersan awareness of CPR procedures to be a significant portion of overall firstaid proficiency.4. <T3>Great Lakes routes for deck licenses for vessels of 200 gross tonsand less: </T3>Three comments suggested the need for an operator of uninspectedpassenger vessels and master of vessels of not more than 100 gross tonswith a Great Lakes route. The Coast Guard agrees, and has made provisionin this final rule for the issuance of original licenses as master of vesselsof not more than 100 gross tons and operator of uninspected passenger vesselswith Great Lakes and inland routes. Both licenses require one year of qualifyingservice. At the suggestion of the Toledo Regional Examination Center, threemonths of the qualifying service must have been on the Great Lakes. TheGreat Lakes service is being required to ensure that individuals obtainingthese limited tonnage licenses have the necessary experience to safelyoperate in that environment. Applicants will take the inland route licenseexamination for the equivalent grade of license. Individuals convertingsmall passenger vessel licenses with ``waters other than ocean or coastwise''routes will normally receive inland routes. However, if the license holdercan demonstrate any prior Great Lakes service, the license will convertto a Great Lakes and inland route.The Coast Guard has decided to extend the three month Great Lakes servicerequirement to licenses as master or mate of vessels of not more than 200gross tons with a Great Lakes and inland route. This is appropriate becauseof the similarities in the amount of required qualifying service and thenature of the service authorized by the license. If the Great Lakes servicerequirement cannot be satisfied, the license will be limited to the inlandwaters of the United States (excluding the Great Lakes).The Coast Guard believes that this Great Lakes experience is unnecessaryfor higher tonnage licenses, because of the greater service and examinationrequirements.5. <T3>Addition of licenses for master/mate of Great Lakes and inland steamor motor vessels of not more than 500 gross tons: </T3>The Coast Guardregional examination centers (RECs) located in the Pacific Northwest haverecommended that provision be made for 500 gross ton master and mate licenseswith an inland route. Large numbers of the 500 gross ton licenses for lakes,bays, and sounds (the comparable license under the old licensing system)have been issued at those RECs. Because of the demand for this size tonnagelicense, this final rule makes provision for master and mate licenses ofnot more than 500 gross tons with a Great Lakes and inland route.6. <T3>Master and mate of rivers: </T3>Seventeen comments urged that a licenselimited to a rivers route be offered which would not require a demonstrationof the chart navigation skills necessary for an inland route license. Consequently,the final rule makes provision for master and mate licenses limited torivers. The periods of required service are the same as required for aGreat Lakes and inland license. License applicants will only be requiredto demonstrate proficiency in navigational instruments and chart skillswhich are necessary in river service.7. <T3>Uninspected fishing industry licenses: </T3>The Final Rule makes provisionfor master and mate licenses of uninspected fishing industry vessels witha near coastal route. Several Coast Guard licensing officers and fishingvessel operators have urged that a fishing vessel license be offered whichdoes not require proficiency in celestial navigation. The qualificationrequirements for a near coastal route are the same as for an ocean route,except that celestial navigation proficiency is not required.The tonnage qualification guidelines have been revised to closely correspondwith those for licenses authorizing service on inspected vessels of similarsize. The system for tonnage computation promulgated in the Interim FinalRule was unreasonably lenient, permitting the qualification for 1,000 grosston licenses using service on extremely small vessels, a result which theCoast Guard did not intend.8. <T3>Age limit reduction for limited master's licenses: </T3>Numerous commentsurged that the minimum age for a limited master's license be reduced to18. Historically, the operation of such vessels is summer employment forstudents. Due to the restricted nature of the service authorized underthe limited master's licenses issued to individuals for employment at formalcamps, yacht clubs, etc., and the characteristic age of individuals normallyemployed in that service, the minimum age for these licenses has been loweredfrom 19 to 18 years.9. <T3>Exemption of certain limited licenses from first aid and CPR requirements:</T3>Several comments dealt with the experience and training requirementsfor a license as limited master or limited operator of uninspected passengervessels issued to individuals for employment at formal camps, yachts clubs,etc. The comments stated that the cumulative requirements of boating experience,first aid course completion, CPR course completion, and boating safetycourse completion were excessive to the needs of marine safety. The commentsalso contended that the cumulative requirements discouraged the students,who are normally the source of such seasonal employees, from seeking employmentin jobs requiring these licenses. The Coast Guard concurs with these comments.Therefore, applicants for original licenses as limited master or limitedoperator of uninspected passenger vessels issued to individuals for employmentat formal camps, yacht clubs, etc. will not be required to complete firstaid and CPR courses, unless required by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection(OCMI). The operating areas authorized such license holders do not involveextended voyages or locations far removed from shoreside assistance. Generally,the craft will be in proximity to marinas, yacht clubs or formal camps,where assistance will be readily available if necessary. The OCMI willrequire this training where the geographic area over which service is authorizedprecludes obtaining first aid services within a reasonable time.10. <T3>Conversion of operator uninspected towing vessels licenses with anupon oceans not more than 200 miles offshore route: </T3>The license asoperator of uninspected towing vessels upon oceans not more than 200 milesoffshore, issued under the regulations in effect prior to December 1, 1987,was not restricted to domestic service. That license authorizes serviceworld wide within 200 miles of any coastline. However, the operator's licensedoes not comply with the requirements of the STCW. To resolve this disparityand avoid the rescinding of any license authority presently granted, arestricted master's license will be issued to these individuals. At thetime of renewal, or sooner where a need is demonstrated, that license willbe converted to a license as <T3>MASTER OF NEAR COASTAL MOTOR VESSELS OF LESS THAN 200 GROSS TONS (RESTRICTEDTO UNINSPECTED TOWING VESSELS); ALSO OPERATOR OF UNINSPECTED TOWING VESSELSGREAT LAKES AND INLAND. </T3>This practice will preserve the currentlyheld license authority when converting the license. The uninspected towingvessel restriction can only be removed by acquiring the qualifying experienceand successfully completing an examination for a master's license, e.g.,master of not more than 200 or master of not more than 500 gross tons.11. <T3>Masters and mates serving as tankerman: </T3>Comments identified anundesirable result of the Interim Final Rule in designating as master ormate many individuals previously designated as ``operator.'' Title 46 CFRPart 12 (Certification of Seamen), Subchapter D (Tank Vessels), SubchapterO (Certain Bulk Dangerous Cargoes), and 33 CFR Subchapter O (Pollution),state that an individual holding a valid license as master, mate, pilotor engineer is allowed to serve as a tankerman. Since individuals holdingthe new license as master or mate of vessels of not more than 200 grosstons have not been required to demonstrate a knowledge of the pollutionprevention regulations to the necessary level, and have not obtained theexperience in bulk liquid transfer procedures required of a tankerman,this inadvertent increase in authority granted to lower level license holdershas the potential for a serious degradation of marine safety.Consequently, the regulations concerning the authority to serve as tankermanfound in 46 CFR Subchapters B, D and O, and 33 CFR Subchapter O are amendedin this Final Rule to indicate that only individuals having a valid licenseas master or mate of inspected, mechanically propelled vessels of morethan 200 gross tons, pilot or engineer may serve as tankerman, in conformitywith the intent of this rulemaking. For clearer presentation, these conformingamendments are placed at the end of this rulemaking.Individuals with a license as master or mate of vessels not more than 200gross tons may qualify for and receive a merchant mariner's document endorsedas tankerman by complying with the provisions of 46 CFR 12.20.12. <T3>Tankerman on towing vessels: </T3>While clarifying the absence of authorityfor licensed masters and mates of not more than 200 gross tons to serveas tankermen, a correction is being made to andSection; 31.15-5 of Title46 CFR which purports to require a licensed officer or tankerman in theregular complement of a towboat crew towing an unmanned tank barge. Thisin effect establishes manning requirements for an uninspected vessel withoutlegislative authority. This requirement is being withdrawn, as it has beendetermined not to be properly founded in the underlying statute.13. <T3>Service on the Inside Passage between Puget Sound and Cape Spencer,Alaska: </T3>Section 10.430 has been modified to authorize the use of GreatLakes and inland or inland licenses on the sheltered waters of the InsidePassage between Puget Sound and Cape Spencer, Alaska. While these watersare outside the Boundary Line used to determine inland waters for licensingpurposes, the Coast Guard has for a number of years classified these watersas lakes, bays and sounds for certain inspection, licensing and manningpurposes. Service on these protected waters is creditable as inland service.14. <T3>Grandfather provision for service toward unlimited deck licenses: </T3>Severalcomments indicated that the increase in minimum gross tonnage for an unlimiteddeck license was adversely affecting the career plans for individuals whohad been working on vessels between 1,000 and 1,600 gross tons. Prior toDecember 1, 1987, this service would have been creditable towards an unlimiteddeck license, while the current regulations require service on vesselsover 1,600 gross tons. Therefore, to reduce the impact of the Part 10 revisionon mariners who have already obtained sea service toward an original licenseor upgrade, for applications received prior to July 1, 1989, service onvessels over 1,000 gross tons may be substituted for the required serviceof over 1,600 gross tons to obtain any gross tonnage endorsement on anunlimited master or mate license. For applications received after July1, 1989 all service will be evaluated at face value. 15. <T3>Physical examinations: </T3>The preamble of the Interim Final Rulerequested comments on the appropriateness of varying the frequency of physicalexaminations for mariners, depending on their age (preamble item andplusmin;43).Eight comments were received: One commentor supported the proposal, andseven expressed opposition to a practice they viewed as illegal and discriminatory.The Coast Guard has not revised the physical examination frequency in thisFinal Rule. The Coast Guard will, however, continue to review the presentphysical requirements to determine their applicability today's maritimeenvironment. 16. <T3>Conversion of lakes, bays and sounds deck licenses: </T3>The tableof corresponding licenses published in the Interim Final Rule indicatesthat an individual with a deck license for lakes, bays, and sounds willreceive a license for an inland route when converting to the new licensestructure. Comments pointed out that this will cause some individuals tolose the authority to continue their current employment. In keeping withthe Coast Guard's stated policy of not removing any authority which a personhad prior to the revision of the licensing regulations, the following guidelineswill apply to conversion of master or mate lakes, bays and sounds licensesheld by those individuals who have been serving upon other than inlandwaters. Individuals who are: a. Currently licensed as master or mate lakes, bays and sounds; b. Authorized service on waters which require the application of the COLREGS;and, c. Able to show proof of employment under the authority of their licenseon waters which are not authorized for a master or mate inland;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">may receive, at the time of conversion, a license as master or mateof inland steam and motor vessels with an additional endorsement as masteror mate of steam and motor vessels upon the specific waters where authorityis necessary to continue their employment. 17. <T3>Deck service for engineering licenses: </T3>The Interim Final Rulemade provision for crediting some engineering experience towards limiteddeck licenses. Comments received indicated the reverse should also be allowed,since individuals assigned on deck of small vessels with limited crew sizespend a significant number of hours performing work normally assigned toengineers on larger vessels. In recognition of this fact, provision hasbeen made for crediting experience on deck toward a portion of the qualifyingservice for limited engineering licenses. 18. <T3>Engineering examinations subject table: </T3>For greater clarity, theSubjects for Engineering License table has been revised to use languagewhich, through previous regulatory use, is familiar to the industry. 19. <T3>Fire fighting training: </T3>Comments suggested that the fire fightingtraining requirements should be tailored to the license title and the classof vessel upon which they will be utilized. The Coast Guard feels thisis not practical because of the wide variety of fire fighting systems utilizedby similar sized vessels in the same industries and the broad service authoritygranted by most licenses. The International Maritime Organization (IMO)Resolution A.437(XI), Training of Crews in Fire-Fighting, is being usedby the Coast Guard as the guideline for course acceptance review. Onlya small portion of the material covered by that resolution would not beapplicable to vessels of all types. 20. <T3>Required training for certain increases in the scope of a license:</T3>Under the Interim Final Rule the requirement for certain deck licenseapplicants to obtain a radar observer certificate, firefighting training,and able seaman qualification found in andSection; 10.401(g) is not applicableto those who obtained their licenses prior to the implementation of theInterim Final Rule, unless the individual applied for a raise in grade.The same is true where firefighting training is required for other licenses.As an example, an individual currently holding a master, oceans, 500 grosston license who applies for an unlimited third mate's license, and subsequentlyprogresses to master, oceans, any gross tons would never be required toobtain this training, since no raise in grade is involved.The Coast Guard believes that such a policy would adversely impact on marinesafety, by permitting large increases in the scope of license authoritywithout obtaining this training. Consequently, in keeping with the intentof this rulemaking, an applicant for a master's or mate's license, whetheroriginal, raise in grade, or increase in scope to a higher tonnage category,will, under this Final Rule, be required to obtain this training, if requiredfor that license and not already completed. Likewise, an applicant fora license as an engineer or operator of uninspected towing vessels, oceans(domestic service), whether an original, raise in grade, or increase inscope (other than an increase in horsepower limitation for engineers) mustmeet the requirement in andSection; 10.205(g) if he or she has not alreadydone so. 21. <T3>International Tonnage Convention: </T3>The effects that the implementationof the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969,will have on licensing and manning regulations continues to be of concernto many individuals and organizations. Comments suggested that these regulationsstate that the domestic tonnage system will be used ``forever'' for licensingand manning purposes. However the final rule, like the Interim Final Rule,does not address the system of tonnage measurement, but rather presumesthat the domestic tonnage system existing at the time of implementationof the regulations will be used. Public Law 99-509 (Oct. 8, 1986, 100 Stat.1919.), Title V, section 5103(g) requires the Secretary of Transportationto submit to Congress before July 19, 1990, a study regarding the impactof applying the Convention tonnages to U.S. laws, the extent to which tonnagethresholds would have to be raised, and ``a recommendation of the levelsto which the tonnage thresholds in laws of the United States * * * shouldbe raised if a complete conversion to the International Convention measurementsystem * * * is made.'' Until such time as the report is submitted to Congress,and any changes to U.S. laws resulting from that study are enacted, theCoast Guard cannot address the issue of future application of the presenttonnage measurement system.As stated in the preamble to the Interim Final Rule, the Coast Guard willmake every attempt to allow merchant mariners to continue service on thosevessels on which they are presently employed. The exact mechanism whichwill be used to accomplish this cannot be determined until regulationsare developed pursuant to legislation implementing the International Conventionon Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.22. <T3>Definitions: </T3>One comment objected to the exclusion of deck maintenancepersons from the definition of ``deck crew.'' The Coast Guard has consistentlyheld that individuals signed on as maintenance persons and carried in excessof the complement required by a vessel's Certificate of Inspection do notcome within the purview of the term ``deck crew.'' No compelling reasonhas been presented to change this position. To avoid confusion in interpreting and applying certain sections of Part15, an explanation of the terms ``self-propelled,'' ``propelled by machinery,''and ``mechanically propelled'' has been added to andSection; 15.301 of theFinal Rule. Although these terms, which are synonymous for purposes ofPart 15, generally conform with the language of the underlying statutes,it is believed that confusion would result if the explanation was not includedin the Final Rule. It should be noted that these terms also include vesselsfitted with both sails and mechanical propulsion. A related issue concerns the applicability of andSection; 15.701, Officers'Competency Certificates Convention, 1936, to sail vessels. Although portionsof andSection;andSection; 15.805 and 15.810 reiterate the requirements of theOfficers' Competency Certificates Convention, 1936, these sections shouldnot be construed as limiting andSection; 15.701 to self-propelled vesselsonly. Section 15.701 applies to self-propelled vessels and to sail vessels,unless otherwise excepted by andSection; 15.701(a). 23. <T3>Employment within restrictions of license or document: </T3>One commentnoted that andSection; 15.401 would require all individuals serving on vesselssubject to any requirement of Part 15 to hold a valid license, certificateof registry, or merchant mariner's document. This was not the intent ofthe section. Therefore, it has been revised to make it clear that the requirementsof this section apply only to positions in which an individual is requiredby law or regulation to hold such a license, certificate of registry, ormerchant mariner's document. 24. <T3>Familiarity with vessel characteristics: </T3>While agreeing with theintent of the requirement for individuals to become familiar with the characteristicsof the vessels on which they are engaged, one comment expressed concernwith the possible interpretations of this requirement; for example, anable seaman being required to be familiar with the technical aspects ofa vessel's machinery space automation systems. The Interim Final Rule requiredindividuals to become familiar with the relevant characteristics of thevessel. Inclusion of the word ``relevant'' qualifies this requirement tothe characteristics of the vessel which are related to duties the individualwill perform or be expected to perform. Therefore, this provision has notbeen changed in the Final Rule. 25. <T3>Certificate of Inspection manning levels: </T3>One comment objectedto individual OCMIs determining minimum required crew complements due tothe possibility that disparate complements may be required aboard similarvessels of a class. Disparities are often due to reasons such as the ownernot pursuing reduced engineroom manning based on automation, nonfunctioningsystems or equipment on some vessels in a class, differing operating routesor procedures, etc. The OCMI is the Coast Guard official most familiarwith the particulars of each vessel he or she certificates; for this reason,the OCMIs' authority to determine specific manning levels for inspectedvessels has been retained. Another comment suggested additions to the listof factors to be considered by the OCMI when determining minimum complementsfor inspected vessels. Although the factors listed in andSection; 15.501(b)were not intended to be all-inclusive, the suggested additions are worthyof inclusion and the section has been revised accordingly. 26. <T3>Voyage: </T3>One comment suggested defining ``voyage'' as the periodof time necessary to transit from the last port of departure to the nextport of arrival. The suggested definition is contrary to the Coast Guard'slongstanding interpretation that stops at intermediate ports while enrouteto the final port do not break the continuity of the ``voyage.'' For thisreason, the suggested change has not been adopted. 27. <T3>Watches: </T3>One comment took exception to the statement in andSection;15.705 that the establishment of adequate watches is the responsibilityof the vessel's master. Circumstances dictate the types of watches requiredfor safe operation of a vessel. Those circumstances include the materielcondition of the vessel, type of propulsion, weather, navigational hazards,number of other vessels in the area, etc. Since many of these factors arevariables that change literally from minute to minute, only an individualphysically present and ``in charge'' of the vessel has all the necessaryinformation to make a decision on the proper deployment of shipboard personnel.Therefore, the master is responsible for making these determinations, andthe statement has been retained. Another comment construed andSection; 15.705of the Interim Final Rule as requiring vessels' chief engineers to standwatches. That section does not specify this. In most situations, adequatelicensed engineers are carried or circumstances are such that the chiefengineer is not required to stand watches. For this reason, the wordingof andSection; 15.705 in the final rule has not been changed. 28. <T3>Watches on uninspected towing vessels: </T3>One comment objected tothe Coast Guard's interpretation that permits licensed individuals servingas operators of uninspected towing vessels that are not subject to theprovisions of the Officers' Competency Certificates Convention, 1936, tobe divided into two watches regardless of the length of the voyage. TheCoast Guard evaluated the issue and concluded that Congress contemplatedthe two watch system for these vessels. For this reason, no change is beingmade to the final rule. Another comment advocates extension of the twowatch system to masters and mates of seagoing uninspected towing vesselsthat are subject to the provisions of the Officers' Competency CertificatesConvention, 1936. The Coast Guard has consistently maintained that thethree watch system of 46 U.S.C. 8104(d) applies to these individuals exceptwhen the vessel is engaged on a voyage of less than 600 miles. The finalrule reflects this. 29. <T3>Working hours: </T3>One comment urged inclusion of a prohibition againstunnecessary work on Sundays and certain holidays when a vessel is at sea.Section 15.710 is a reiteration of portions of 46 U.S.C. 8104 which addressthis prohibition to vessels in safe harbors. Inasmuch as the statute doesnot include vessels at sea in this prohibition, the suggestion has notbeen adopted in the Final Rule. 30. <T3>Sailing short: </T3>One comment suggested that the sailing short requirementinclude provisions for situations in which a seaman is authorized vacationand a replacement cannot be obtained. This situation does not fall withinthe statutory requirements of 46 U.S.C. 8101(e). Thus, the sailing shortrequirement, a reiteration of the statute, has not been revised to authorizedeparture of the vessel on its voyage in this situation. 31. <T3>Responsibility for proper manning: </T3>One comment noted that notall vessels are commanded by individuals licensed as master, yet the propermanning of vessels in accordance with the applicable laws, regulations,and international conventions is the responsibility of the individual incommand of the vessel. The Coast Guard concurs and andSection; 15.801 hasbeen revised accordingly. 32. <T3>Master: </T3>Inasmuch as 46 U.S.C. 2101 contains definitions of both``passenger vessel'' and ``small passenger vessel,'' andSection; 15.805 hasbeen revised in the Final Rule to clarify the Coast Guard's intent of requiringa master on every passenger and small passenger vessel. 33. <T3>Minimum number of mates: </T3>One comment suggested specifying, inregulation, the minimum number of mates required on inspected, inland vessels.The OCMI who certificates the vessel is the Coast Guard official most familiarwith the vessel and its operations, and is, therefore, in the best positionto determine the minimum number of mates required for safe vessel operations.Although, andSection; 15.801 requires OCMIs to determine specific manninglevels (including mates, first class pilots, etc.), andSection; 15.810 hasbeen revised to clarify the OCMIs' authority for determining the minimumnumber of mates to be required on inspected vessels, including inland vessels.Another comment concerned the application of the requirement for a mateon vessels of less than 100 gross tons which do not make ``voyages'' inthe traditional sense of the term. The comment was directed to vesselsmaking short transits between two locations, such as a vessel engaged inferry operations. No change has been made to the Final Rule because inthese situations an OCMI can endorse the vessel's Certificate of Inspectionto require that alternate crews be provided. This obviates the need forcontinuously carrying a licensed mate as a second watchstander for operationsexceeding 12 hours in any 24 hour period. 34. <T3>Radar observer: </T3>One comment recommended that all commercial vessels,and vessels which carry more than six passengers, be required to be fittedwith radar, and that the licensed deck individuals on these vessels berequired to possess radar observer qualifications. Vessel equipment requirementsare outside the scope of this rulemaking. A regulatory project currentlyunder development (CGD 85-080a) will address the issue of radar observerqualifications for licensed deck individuals on small passenger vessels.35. <T3>Lookouts: </T3>Three comments recommended modification or deletionof the requirement of andSection; 15.850 that the duties of lookout be performedby a member of the navigational watch. The comments suggested that therequirement could be construed as not allowing other vessel crewmembersto stand a lookout watch in the event that a regular watchstander is notavailable due to illness or some other reason. The requirement has beenretained. The rule does not preclude other qualified individuals from beingassigned lookout duties. During such periods, these individuals becomepart of the navigational watch and are subject to requirements such asthe three watch requirements of andSection; 15.705. 36. <T3>Equivalents: </T3>Additional revisions have been made to the FinalRule to clarify certain sections of Subpart H of Part 15, Equivalents.These revisions are the result of comments received and requests for clarificationfrom Coast Guard district and field offices. The revisions are: (a) The structure of the text of andSection; 15.901 has been revised forconsistency with the other sections in Subpart H. Other revisions to andSection;15.901 are noted below. (b) Sections 15.901, 15.905, and 15.910 have been revised to clarify theintent that certain of the authorities allowed by these sections applyonly to individuals who hold licenses for service on inspected, self-propelledvessels. Without these revisions, these sections could be construed asauthorizing individuals licensed for service on uninspected vessels suchas fishing industry vessels to serve in licensed capacities on certaininspected vessels, certain passenger carrying vessels, and uninspectedtowing vessels. This was not the intent of these sections, therefore, therevisions clarify the types of licenses necessary for these authorizations.(c) Individuals holding licenses as first class pilot are authorized byandSection;andSection; 15.901, 15.905, and 15.910 of the final rule to serveas master on vessels of not more than 100 gross tons, operator of uninspectedpassenger vessels, and operator of uninspected towing vessels, respectively,within any restrictions on the individual's license. Section 15.901(a)of the Interim Final Rule authorized pilots to serve as master on vesselsof not more than 100 gross tons, therefore, authorization to also serveas operator of uninspected passenger vessels is also considered appropriate.One comment recommended continuance of the authority for pilots to serveas operators of uninspected towing vessels. This authorization is consistentwith past Coast Guard policy and with the stated intention of this projectto minimize penalties to current license holders whenever possible. Itshould be noted, however, that service beyond the restrictions on an individual'slicense, including geographic or route restrictions, is not authorized.It should also be noted that a license as first class pilot does not, byitself, authorize service on uninspected towing vessels which are subjectto the Officers' Competency Certificates Convention, 1936. Similarly, licensesas operator or second-class operator of uninspected towing vessels or otherlicenses which authorize such service do not, by themselves, authorizeservice on uninspected towing vessels which are subject to the convention.(d) In addition to other revisions described in this document, andSection;15.905 of the Final Rule incorporates two additional changes. The firstrelates to the authority of mates to serve as operators of uninspectedpassenger vessels. Part 10 of the final rule requires six months servicefor an individual to qualify for a license as mate of Great Lakes, inlandor river vessels of not more than 200 gross tons. To qualify for a licenseas operator of uninspected passenger vessels, an individual is requiredto have 12 months service. Two comments objected to the authorization forthese mates, with their reduced service requirements, to serve as operatoron Great Lakes or inland vessels. The Coast Guard concurs and has, therefore,eliminated the authorization for mates of Great Lakes or inland vesselsof not more than 200 gross tons to serve as operators of uninspected passengervessels. The other change relates to gross tonnage limitations on the licensesof individuals authorized by this section to serve as operator of uninspectedpassenger vessels, i.e. uninspected vessels of less than 100 gross tonscarrying not more than six passengers. Operator of uninspected passengervessel licenses are not issued with tonnage limitations, therefore, individualsauthorized service on these vessels by andSection; 15.905 should not be limitedby the gross tonnage limitations of their licenses. Section andSection; 15.905has been revised accordingly. It should be noted that the operator requirementsapply to self-propelled uninspected passenger vessels, therefore, a licenseauthorizing service on self-propelled vessels satisfies the section eventhough the uninspected passenger vessel might also be equipped with sails.(e) Section 15.910(b) has been amended to clarify its intent that an operatorof uninspected towing vessels be on board when the vessel is being operatedby an individual whose license authorizes service as second-class operatoronly (as opposed to a license which authorizes service as both operatorand second-class operator of uninspected towing vessels). (f) Section 15.915 has been revised to provide consistency with the revisionto andSection; 10.501 made by this Final Rule and to incorporate the specificservice authorities allowed for designated duty engineers. 37. <T3>Tug and barge limitation on pilot's licenses: </T3>One commenter disagreedwith the tug and barge combination limitation on a first class pilot'slicense or endorsement which is permitted under andSection; 10.711(d). Thecommenter stated that the pilot license should not be trade/vessel restrictivesince a pilot who gains the experience and passes the examination, includingthe chart sketch, has proven his/her professional competence. The Officerin Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) has always had the authority to imposeappropriate limitations commensurate with the experience of the applicant,with respect to class or type of vessel, tonnage, route, and waters (46CFR 10.701(c)). Therefore, andSection; 10.711(d) does not give the OCMI anynew or additional authority; he already has it. The discussion in the regulationitself (andSection; 10.711(d)) regarding a tug and barge combination limitationis intended as clarification and guidance. We agree with the commenterto a certain extent, in that, in the majority of cases we would not expectthe limitation to be imposed. However, there are circumstances that, dueto the nature of the waters and the overall experience of the applicant,self-propelled vessel experience would be necessary to obtain a first classpilot's license or endorsement that is not restricted to tug and bargecombinations. 38. <T3>Authority to ``serve as'' pilot on tank barges: </T3>One commenterstated that in the andSection; 15.812(e) provision permitting an operatorto ``serve as'' pilot for tank barges, the Coast Guard leaves it up tothe operator to determine the geographic limits of the route. This problemstems from the fact that the ``serve as'' pilot is not issued a pilot licenseor endorsement that describes the specific waters, including geographiclimitations, upon which he is authorized to serve as pilot. The individualmaster, mate, or operator must self-certify that he or she has become qualifiedby acquiring the required round trips over the route upon which he or sheintends to serve as pilot. Without receiving an endorsement, the individualdoes not have any documentation to indicate that the Coast Guard concursin his or her interpretation of the geographic area upon which he or sheis qualified to serve. The Coast Guard is in the process of developinga Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC), or other suitable document,which would identify the geographic limits of routes for the ``serve as''pilot. Additionally, the commenter stated that the Coast Guard does notmake an effort to verify that the required number of round trips has beenmade. As to verification of the round trips, the Coast Guard intends thatthis requirement would be self-enforcing due to the consequences of servingas a pilot without a valid license, endorsement or authorization. The samecommenter asked how the ``serve as'' pilot can demonstrate his local knowledgeand familiarity with the route if he or she does not have to do a chartsketch. In the case of the ``serve as'' pilot, the required round tripsprovide the local knowledge. The commenter also asked why we would permitindividuals to ``serve as'' pilot when they have the opportunity to belicensed pilots. The Coast Guard does not approach licensing requirementsbased on ``the opportunity to be licensed,'' but rather, on reasonablesafety standards and requirements. In the case of the ``serve as'' pilot,our analysis indicates that safety would not be sacrificed by permittingindividuals to serve as pilot, without taking the first class pilot examination,provided they satisfy the other requirements identified in the regulations.39. <T3>Recency for pilotage: </T3>One commenter stated that recency of serviceover the specified waters should be required for an individual to serveas a pilot. Section 15.812(d) states that a licensed master or mate qualifyingunder andSection; 15.812(c)(2) may serve as pilot. In order to qualify underthat section, an individual must comply with the recency of knowledge provisionsof 46 CFR 10.713 (see andSection; 15.812(c)(2)(ii)). Therefore, recency ofservice is required before an individual may serve as pilot under the authorityof his master or mate's license. One round trip over the route within thepast 60 months is required. 40. <T3>Authority to require pilots on Great Lakes vessels: </T3>One commentstated that there is no legal authority to issue a blanket requirementfor pilots onboard Great Lakes vessels operating under enrollment. The Coast Guard originally required a pilot on vessels operating on theGreat Lakes under the authority of the old 46 U.S.C. 404 which was amendedby Pub. L. 96-378 to replace the word ``pilot'' with ``deck officer.''The Coast Guard is authorized under 46 U.S.C. 8101 to determine the complementof licensed individuals, including pilots, considered necessary for a vessel'ssafe operation. The Coast Guard continues to require pilots on inspectedmechanically propelled vessels and tank barges inspected under 46 U.S.C.Chapter 37 operating on the Great Lakes under this authority. 41. <T3>Signaling (flashing light) proficiency: </T3>Aside from the preamblediscussion of the signaling requirement for licenses, the only mentionof this requirement in the Interim Final Rule is its inclusion in the tableof subjects for deck licenses, andSection; 10.910. A strict interpretationof this table would preclude an individual who has successfully completedall the examination requirements, except the signaling requirement, fromobtaining a license as third mate, second mate, chief mate, or master.This is an unintended reversal of a longstanding Coast Guard policy toissue the license where flashing light proficiency is deficient, but tolimit the tonnage on which service is authorized. The Coast Guard willcontinue this policy. Therefore, andSection; 10.401 of the final rule hasbeen revised to permit the issuance of a license limited to vessels ofnot more than 1600 gross tons to those applicants who successfully completeall parts of the examination, except the signaling requirement.42. <T3>Service Requirements for Endorsement as First Class Pilot:</T3> Asindicated in the Interim Final Rule (52 FR 38658), the Coast Guard intendedto incorporate the substance of its final rule (50 FR 26106) concerningthe professional requirements for pilot licenses by reformatting and reorganizingit to be consistent with the rules for licensing of maritime personnel,published simultaneously (52 FR 38614). Comments from Coast Guard licensingofficials pointed out the unintended elimination in the Interim Final Ruleof specific service requirements for an endorsement as first class piloton an individual's license. Section 10.703 has been revised in the finalrule to restore these long standing specific service requirements. In addition,andSection; 10.701 is revised in the final rule to make it clear that endorsementsas first class pilot for service on vessels of 1600 gross tons or lesswill not be issued. Such endorsements are unnecessary, as andSection; 15.812authorizes appropriately licensed individuals to serve as pilots on vesselsof not more than 1600 gross tons.43. <T3>Route Familiarization Requirements:</T3> An individual questioned whetherexperience as an observer would satisfy the round trip requirements forroute familiarization contained in andSection; 10.705(b). Observer experiencehas been acceptable since 1965, and probably before that. The pre-June1985 pilot regulations included the sentence ``Experience as an observer,properly certified by the master and/or pilot of the vessel is also acceptablein such cases''. That sentence was replaced in the present regulationswith the phrase ``or in an equivalent capacity''. We considered the ``equivalentcapacity'' phrase to be broader and to include the observer, as it wasnot our intent to eliminate observer experience. Therefore, we are addingthe sentence ``Evidence of having completed a minimum number of round tripswhile servicing as an observer, properly certified by the master and/orpilot of the vessel, is also acceptable'' to the regulations in order tomake it clearer that observer experience is acceptable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation</ITAG>The regulatory evaluations published with the Interim Final Rules on October16, 1987 (52 FR 38614 and 52 FR 38658) are still valid. The revisions includedin this final rule do not alter the assumptions or cost estimates previouslypublished.The agency certifies that these final rules will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. These finalrules apply to licenses for individuals only. The residual effects on trainingschools may be a minor modification in some course structures to reflectexam topics for licenses, course title changes to reflect new license titles,and, possibly, some combining of courses to account for the deletion ofmost trade restricted licenses.This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that thefinal rules do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant thepreparation of a Federalism Assessment.These final rules contain no new information collection requirements. Theinformation collection requirements that they do contain have been submittedto the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the PaperworkReduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and have been approved by OMB. The section numbers andthe corresponding OMB approval numbers are listed in andSection; 10.107.A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory InformationService Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of eachyear.
