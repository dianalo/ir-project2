This airchange will not only be determined by the persons within the room andtheir activities, but also be influenced by the pollution load from buildingmaterial and the airconditioning plant itself, particularly if thereare variations in the room air humidity. The number of air changes ofconventional airconditioning plants with mixed flow to care for a satisfactorycomfort feeling will therefore be essentially higher than has been provisedfor construction up to now. The advantages and drawbacks of known airconditioningsystems are discussed here under consideration of these new findings,and a way is shown how thermal comfort can be improved, and energy costbe reduced, not by increasing the number of air changes but by a betterutilisation of the available air stream.</TEXT></DOC>
