Foley said today it isunrealistic to expect a tax increase to pay for President Bush'santi-drug package unless Bush supports one.   ``Without the administration's support, the idea of raising taxesis futile,'' the Washington Democrat told reporters.   Bush has said consistently that no tax increase is needed to fundhis drug war, and that money should be diverted from other federalprograms to pay for it.   But Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways andMeans Committee, said ``unless the president supports the taxincreases that will be necessary to fight this war, the drug dealersare going to win.''   Most Democrats were quick to praise the program's aims, announcedby the president in a nationally televised speech Tuesday night,including tougher penalties for users, stepped-up interdiction andmore money for prisons, treatment programs, education and prevention.   But many questioned the administration's plan to help pay thebill by squeezing $716 million from existing programs, a subjectlikely to come up Thursday when national drug coordinator WilliamBennett defends the outline before the Senate Judiciary Committee.   Foley predicted that Congress would approve spending ``at leastthe amount the president recommended'' this year, and said, ``nextyear, I expect we will be offering more than the president'sproposal.''   ``I'm not going to outline it in detail,'' he said when askedwhat programs could be cut to find the money. ``Trust us.''   Foley said Tuesday following a White House briefing forcongressional leaders that ``it's very difficult to assume we can,at leat over the long term, meet the cost of the drug war withoutsome additional revenue coming into the government.''   ``This is a war on drugs, not a war on the American taxpayer,''countered Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.   Administration budget director Richard Darman said money can bediverted from programs such as juvenile justice, economicdevelopment and immigration reform to help pay for the $7.9 billiondrug plan Bush outlined Tuesday night.   But Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said Bush should lookelsewhere for the money.   ``He is suggesting that we do it out of funds the Congress isn'tgoing to cut,'' DeConcini said.   The plan calls for cutting $320 million from grants to helpstates pay for immigration legalization services, $194 million fromthe Economic Development Administration, $40 million from juvenilejustice programs, $15 million to reclaim lost postal revenue, $50million from public housing subsidies and $132 million from aDefense Department radio project.   Former President Reagan repeatedly tried to scrap the EDA, butCongress always refused.   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing HouseWays and Means Committee, said that ``unless the president supportsthe tax increases that will be necessary to fight this war, the drugdealers are going to win.''   ``As despicable as drug dealers are, they understand economics,''Rostenkowski said. ``If you want to play, you've got to pay.''   But House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., emerged froma White House briefing to say that offsetting cuts should get theprogram through its first year.   ``And then after that we're going to have to take a look at it, acontinuing look, because it's not going to be won in one year, andit'll be a costly venture,'' Michel said.   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said inthe formal Democratic response to the president's remarks that theplan needed more police, prosecutors, judges and prisons.   ``Quite frankly, the president's plan is not tough enough, boldenough or imaginative enough to meet the crisis at hand,'' Bidensaid.   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., however, accused the president ofgoing overboard.   ``If the Bennett-Bush plan's promise to punish drug users werecarried through, America would become a police state,'' said theformer FBI agent and chairman of the House subcommittee on civil andconstitutional rights.   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., expressed ``strong support'' for ``acomprehensive plan and challenge to the nation.''   ``An overwhelming majority of Americans are prepared to rejecttotally the use of narcotics and to help relieve the suffering ofthose previously addicted,'' Lugar said.   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., predicted that ``there'll be somedifferences about where the money comes from, but we can get themoney.''</TEXT></DOC>
