In his State of the Union address last week, Mr. Bushvowed to pump an extra $10 billion into the economy in thenext six months by speeding up &quot;pro-growth expenditures&quot; foran array of farm, housing and public works programs. &quot;Thereare certain things that a president can do without Congress-- and I am going to do them,&quot; he said.</LP><TEXT>   In fact, many of the accounts covered by Mr. Bush's orderhave been targeted for cuts by his own administration in thepast and again this year. And in some cases, even though Mr.Bush boasts that he is acting unilaterally, he actually isobliged to spend the funds quickly because of provisionswritten into law by Congress in October.   For example, documents distributed by the Office ofManagement and Budget suggest that the administration willmake an extra $1.9 billion available largely by allocatingfederal funds for farm ownership and operating loans in thefirst two quarters of the current fiscal year. Not mentionedis the fact that House and Senate Appropriations committeesadded a requirement to the Agriculture Department budget inthe fall to require such a policy. The committees acted afterreceiving complaints by lawmakers of foot-dragging by theOMB.   &quot;To say that he is going to spend money that he has beenessentially ordered to do puts a false front on things,&quot; saidHouse Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.).&quot;It's too cute by half and this shows it.&quot;   Moreover, Mr. Bush's description of the programs as&quot;pro-growth expenditures&quot; hardly fits his past budgets. Forexample, for fiscal 1992 the president proposed to cut fundsfor direct farm operating loans from $900 million to $410million. And for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 he isasking for $314 million, which is $536 million less than whatCongress finally approved for this year. The smaller farmownership loan program has fared somewhat better, but theadministration's new budget proposes to cut the program to$28 million next year, or half the current appropriation.   The president's &quot;acceleration project&quot; is dogged bysimilar discrepancies in other areas. For example, the WhiteHouse now proposes to speed up the processing ofsingle-family loans under a federal rural housing program,even though the administration has sought repeatedly to cuthundreds of millions of dollars from this account in recentyears. Similarly, the administration says its can pump $3billion into the economy by accelerating the processing ofgrants to build waste-treatment facilities. But the OMB hassought regularly to pare the appropriations approved byCongress, and as vice president, Mr. Bush backed a Reaganadministration proposal in fiscal 1987 to phase out theprogram entirely by 1990.   Such contradictions are viewed with wry amusement andirritation in Congress. Many lawmakers, including Mr.Panetta, detect the hand of OMB Director Richard Darman. The&quot;acceleration project&quot; is seen as a political effort to bluntdemands for a jobs bill to pump up public-works spendingfurther.   Moreover, the $10 billion goal is elusive itself,according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.&quot;In most cases, this earlier availability is likely to haveno significant effect on the timing of cash outlays,&quot; the CBOsaid in a report last month.   Democrats are wary of committing themselves to major newexpenditures for the current fiscal year, and the greaterfight will be over the distribution of whatever savings areachieved by cuts in the military budget next year. Aninformal alliance has developed between the leaders of theHouse Appropriations and Ways and Means committees on theissue, but Robert Byrd, chairman of the Senate AppropriationsCommittee, has been caught in a squeeze between his partyleadership and the tax-writing Finance Committee.   Appearing before the Senate Budget Committee, the WestVirginia Democrat argued strongly against using defensesavings for a tax cut. He later signaled that his differenceswith party leaders was such that he had declined to serve ona task force appointed by Majority Leader George Mitchell.</TEXT></DOC>
