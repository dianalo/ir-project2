Opposition to the FSX fighter deal has galvanized lawmakers,executives, academics and others who say the United States shoulddiscard its devotion to free trade and adopt Japanese-style measures.   For a change, opposition to aspects of the jet fighter deal havecome not only from lobbyists and think tankers, but from prominentfigures in Bush's own administration, including Commerce SecretaryRobert Mosbacher.   The ferocity of the FSX debate marks it as a turning point inAmerican attitudes toward competition with Japan _ reshaped by thepersistent trade deficit and rivalries in semiconductors,high-definition television and superconductivity.   ``There is no doubt that the FSX issue is important, in that it'sthe first evidence that some elements of the U.S. government arestarting to come to grips intellectually with the challenge ofJapan,'' said Chalmers Johnson, a professor of Asian studies at theUniversity of California at San Diego.   ``For the first time in the postwar world, instead of trying makethe Japanese look like us, we are behaving ever so slightly like theJapanese,'' Johnson said.   Under the agreement signed late last year, St. Louis-basedGeneral Dynamics Corp. would join forces with Japan's MitsubishiHeavy Industries to develop and produce the FSX, an advanced versionof the U.S. F-16 fighter.   President Bush last week said he endorsed the deal, but agreed toinsist on modifications to safeguard U.S. technology and assureAmerican industry has a share in the plane's production.   Some opponents say Japan should simply buy F-16s, which would becheaper for Japan and help shrink the U.S. trade deficit. Japan hasrefused to do that, but only because it was not pushed to the limit,they say.   So far the debate hasn't led to bitter displays of emotion, likelast year's fury over Toshiba Machine Co.'s illegal sales to theSoviet Union, which led congressmen to smash Toshiba radios outsidethe Capitol.   But as with any good rallying issue, the FSX reflects biggerconcerns, including the loss of America's high-technology leadershipand the dominance of military considerations in American foreignpolicy.   ``There's a sense of frustration in the country,'' said KevinKing, editor of ``Japan Bashing Alert,'' which tracks comments aboutJapan in 1,500 U.S. publications on behalf of Dentsu, of Japan, theworld's largest advertising agency.   ``The aerospace is such a sensitive issue because it's the lastindustry which we can safely say we still dominate,'' King said.   In Washington, the seismic change in opinion has split theCommerce Department, which promotes U.S. commercial interests, apartfrom the State and Defense departments, which put global securityissues first.   The Commerce Department's star is slowly rising, although theadjustment ``is still lagging behind events,'' said Ernest H. Preeg,a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and InternationalStudies in Washington.   A leader in the fight against the FSX, Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr.,gave intellectual respectability to the cause of managed trade lastyear in a book called ``Trading Places: How We Allowed Japan to Takethe Lead.''   Prestowitz, a former U.S. trade negotiator, compared Americans tolonesome cowboys and Japanese to settlers: ``Under attack theycircle the wagons together and take on all comers. And win.''   The United States cannot be a free trader when Japan blocksadvanced American products from its own market while developingcompeting products of its own, as in the case of supercomputers,some of the new interventionists say.   ``We must begin to act like we were a developing nation,'' saidKathryn Harrigan, a professor of strategic management at ColumbiaUniversity. ``Our false pride continues to make us ethnocentricabout where ideas come from.''   In contrast to those who fear foreign investment, Ms. Harrigansaid she favors it as long as Americans benefit with good jobs.   ``We want the critical tasks done on American soil, so Americans,I don't care who they work for, manage to keep themselves on thecutting edge,'' she said. ``In time of war, we (could) exercise oursovereign control over property.''   All this talk of managed trade and industrial policy troublesfree traders such as Edward Hudgins, director of the Center forInternational Growth at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.   ``There is no way we could set up that sort of a managementsystem in the United States. It's a very fierce, aggressive,no-holds-barred competition of special interest groups here. We donot have a sort of consensus culture as they do in Japan,'' Hudginssaid.   But even Hudgins sees some Japanese things worth emulating. Hefavors repealing most antitrust laws, eliminating taxes on earnedinterest income to encourage savings, and breaking down thedistinction between commercial and investment banks.
