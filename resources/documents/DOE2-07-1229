The inhomogeneous B/sub 1/ field of a surface coil candegrade the volume selectivity of the ISIS experiment. Studies were performedusing a Philips Gyroscan. The surface coil was placed over the organof interest, and an MR image was obtained. Through the MR image, the3D volume of interest was selected and the P-31 MR spectrum obtainedfrom this volume with the ISIS experiment. Surface coil spectra fromhuman liver, transplanted kidney, heart (gated), and tumors were obtainedwithout contamination from surface structure.</TEXT></DOC>
