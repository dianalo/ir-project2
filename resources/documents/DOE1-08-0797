<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-08-0797 </DOCNO><TEXT>Biomass production by waterh yacinth has been found to be 100 Mg (dryweight)/ha/year for plants grown in nutrient medium and outside in Florida.With optimal temperature, CO{sub 2} concentration (both provided by cheapindustrial wastes) and greenhouse covering, yield close to 200 t/ha/yearcould be achieved. The efficiency of solar energy conversion by sucha crop would be 5 to 6% i.e. twice what is obtained with sugarcane, themore efficient traditional crop. The aim of the proposed research isto build a dynamic growth model with a mechanistic basis allowing toassess the impact on biomass production of changes in microclimatic conditions,crop management or plant characteristics through plant breeding. Althoughthe model will be effective in simulating plant behaviour under highCO{sub 2} greenhouse conditions, its mechanistic basis will make it relevantto a broader range of conditions. Intense experimentation in growth chambersunder a range of environmental conditions will provide the model parameterswhile growth under different conditions will be used to test the outputsof the model. The experiments in growth chambers will also be a largeand direct source of information for crop management. (Refs. 19).</TEXT></DOC>
