(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Martin Marietta Corp. Tuesday said itsincome fell about 60 percent in the fourth quarter reflectingestablishment of a reserve to compensate for increasing competitionin commercial satellite launching.   But, for all of last year the company reported a 55.6 percentincrease in profit, record sales and an all-time high of backloggedorders.   ``The year's results attest to the vitality and strong earningpower of our core busineses and give us renewed confidence of solidfuture earnings progress,'' said Norman R. Augustine, chairman andchief executive.   The company said after-tax earnings came to $23.7 million, or 45cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, down from $59.4million, or $1.12 a share, in the corresponding 1987 quarter. Fourthquarter sales totaled $1.5 billion, compared to $1.3 billion for1987's fourth quarter.   In 1988, Martin Marietta's profit totaled $358.9 million, or$6.75 per share, compared with $230.7 million, or $4.25, per sharein 1987. The record sales amount was $5.7 billion, up from 1987's$5.1 billion and the backlog of undelivered orders amounted to $11.2billion vs. $10.8 billion in 1987.   Earnings for 1988 included a fourth quarter reserve of $90million, or $1.05 per share, to put the Commercial Titan launchprogram ``on a more conservative footing,'' the company said. Thereserve was more than offset for the year's results by a $2.25 pershare from the third quarter sale of Hoskyns Group plc, a Britishdata systems subsidiary.   The reserve for the Titan program reflects prospective revenues,costs, and demand for commercial launch vehicles. Titan equipment isused in the launch of commercial and military communicationssatellites.   ``It was considered a prudent action in view of current industrypricing following the recent entry into the world market of theChinese Long March launch vehicle,'' the company statement said.</TEXT></DOC>
