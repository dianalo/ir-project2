The assessment provides a basis for theconclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineered plant-associatedmicro-organisms will not present a risk of introduction or disseminationof a plant pest and will not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the releaseinto the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmentalassessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement beforeissuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article(see 52 FR 22906).Crop Genetics International, Hanover, Maryland, has submitted an applicationfor a permit for release into the environment, to field test geneticallyengineered plant-associated micro-organisms at eight locations. The locationsare in Sangamon County, Illinois; Queen Annes and Prince Georges Counties,Maryland; Goodhue County, Minnesota; and Clay and Dodge Counties, Nebraska.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the plant-associated micro-organisms underconditions described in the Crop Genetics International application. APHISconcluded that the field testing will not present a risk of plant pestintroduction or dissemination and will not have any significant impacton the quality of the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Crop Genetics International, as well asa review of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. The delta-endotoxin gene from <T3>Bacillus thuringiensis </T3>was inserted into the <T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>genome. The gene is lost from the bacterium at therate of once in every 12,500 bacterial cells per generation <T3>in vitro. </T3>Both the revertant (which has lost the delta-endotoxingene) and the naturally occurring bacterial strains grow faster (14 percentgrowth rate differential in laboratory medium) than the recombinant bacterium.In the field, revertant bacteria can make up to 6 percent of the populationof the bacterium, depending on the plant part, by the end of the gowingseason. Thus, the delta-endotoxin gene will enventually be lost from therecombinant bacterium.2. The genetic alternations are not expected to enhance any plant pathogenicproperty of the recombinant bacterium as compared to the parental strainof <T3>C. xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>that is already present in Illinois, Maryland, andNebraska, where seven of the test plots are located. In addition, thereis evidence that Bermuda grass containing <T3>C. xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>has also been introduced previously into Minnesota.3. Although <T3>C. xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>is readily transferred by mechanical means (e.g., cuttingtools) to other plants, it is not transferred easily by other mechanismsin the field. Transfer to other plants by mechanical transfer will be minimizedin the field plot designs and field plot protocals which include bufferzones and tools disinfection. The bacterium does not appear to proliferateoutside the host plant. In addition, regular monitoring for the recombinantbacterium will ensure that if it spreads to plants at the edge of the testplots, it will be detected.4. Dissemination of <T3>C. xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>can occur in seed, so all seed not used for researchpurposes (in containment) will be destroyed, preventing transfer by thismechanism.5. Data have been provided by the company to demonstrate that the probabilityof transfer of the delta-endotoxin gene from the recombinant bacteriumto other micro-organisms is extremely remote.6. The recombinant bacterium has a relatively low order of toxicity tosusceptible insects. The field test plots are very small. Therefore, theintroduction of the recombinant bacterium poses no significant impact onsusceptible insect populations.7. There were no listed (January 1, 1989, 50 CFR 17.11 and 17.12) threatenedor endangered insect species present in the test sites in Illinois, Maryland,Nebraska, or Minnesota, so the introduction of the recombinant bacteriumposes no risk to these threatened insects.8. The inherent properties of <T3>C. xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis </T3>and the recombinant bacterium indicate that there areno human health risks. The bacterium does not grow at human body temperature.The bacterium has been shown not to be pathogenic or toxic in mammaliantests. In addition, all crops will be used for research purposes or destroyedso that there will be no dietary exposure to humans.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, 4 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 15th day of May 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
