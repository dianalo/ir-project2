In this article, the authors reviewrecent data regarding the nature of evidence for gene transfer in fungiand the characterization of the tranformants, and discuss the use ofgene transfer as a genetic system to seek answers to several questionsconcerning the regulatory control and other basic mechanisms of eurkaryotes.</TEXT></DOC>
