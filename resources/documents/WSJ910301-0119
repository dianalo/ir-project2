The new &quot;cross-rate&quot; futures and options contracts will beoffered as early as this summer at exchanges in Chicago andMinneapolis. Currently, only futures contracts based onforeign currencies' values against the dollar are availableon world exchanges.</LP><TEXT>   The need for currency futures that aren't related to thedollar has grown as the German mark and Japanese yen havegained world stature as benchmarks. Ten years ago, almost alltrades between foreign currencies involved selling onecurrency for dollars, then buying another with the U.S.currency.   But the interbank market -- the network of internationalbanks that trades $650 billion of currencies daily -- hasbuilt a booming business in cross-rate trading. Now about 40%of all world currency trades don't involve the dollar, andthat percentage is growing. It is mainly banks andinstitutional investors who have access to that market.   Traders say the new cross-rate futures planned at theChicago Mercantile Exchange and the fledgling Twin CitiesBoard of Trade will allow more smaller players into thecross-rates arena.   &quot;This will give small investors access to a market that'sbeen closed to them,&quot; says William Arnold, vice president forforeign exchange at Chemical Bank in New York. &quot;Taken as agroup, small investors can add depth and liquidity to themarket. It's potentially a very good thing.&quot;   The cross-rate market is interesting to speculatorsbecause it is highly volatile, often more so than theexchange rates between U.S. dollars and foreign currencies.Cross-rates are influenced by political and economic trendsand developments in Europe, Asia and elsewhere, all of whichcan create opportunities to make a profit.   But, as with any commodity, the potential forinexperienced or unwary investors to lose money is great, socommodity advisers urge caution when the new cross-ratefutures and options become available.   A cross-rate futures contract obligates its holder toexchange a given quantity of one foreign currency for anotherat a specified date in the future. An option entitles, butdoesn't obligate, an investor to buy or sell one futurescontract; options typically require less capital to tradethan futures, and used conventionally they limit the lossesan investor can sustain if the market moves adversely.   The Chicago Merc has applied for approval from theCommodity Futures Trading Commission to trade six cross-ratefutures and six options. These would include contractspitting Japanese yen against German marks, yen againstBritish pounds, yen against Swiss francs, pounds againstmarks, pounds against francs and francs against marks.   Todd Petzel, chief economist for the Merc, says theexchange probably will introduce the mark-based contractsfirst, this summer, and follow with the other contracts. TheMerc expects CFTC approval for the contracts within twomonths, he adds.   The Minneapolis exchange received CFTC approval this weekfor its cross-rate futures contract -- pitting pounds againstmarks -- and expects to begin trading the contract on June 3.It plans to introduce mark-yen and mark-franc futures bymidsummer and offer options on the futures contracts by yearend, says John P. Heffernan, a director at the exchange.   The Philadelphia Stock Exchange also plans to take a stabat the cross-rate market. It's awaiting approval from theSecurities and Exchange Commission for instruments that wouldallow investors to bet on the yen versus mark, for example,and settle the trade in marks rather than U.S. dollars.   Warrants on the yen's value against the mark's already aretrading on the New York Stock Exchange. During the next twoyears, the price of the warrants will rise if the yenstrengthens against the mark and fall if the mark strengthensagainst the yen. These instruments aren't as flexible asfutures and options contracts, but they are trading anaverage 26,365 warrants daily.   One use of the Chicago and Minneapolis contracts would beto hedge the risk of the large currency trades thatinternational banks make each day -- exchanging, say, yen formarks. The risk implicit in such a trade is that the yen-markexchange rate may fluctuate unfavorably before the trade iscomplete and cost the bank money. It could use futures oroptions contracts to lay off such risk.   Banks also could use the contracts to speculate, lookingfor opportunities to profit when, for example, therelationship of yen to marks in the interbank market differsfrom the rate quoted on the Chicago and Minneapolisexchanges.   &quot;We should be active there,&quot; says Alain Dutronc, managingvice president for options at the French bank SocieteGenerale's New York office. &quot;We'd look at arbitrageopportunities, and to the extent that they existed at theMercantile Exchange, we'd take advantage of them.&quot;   Institutional currency speculators say one likelyinnovation of the new cross-rate options contracts, inparticular, will be that they will have more consistent andprobably cheaper prices than the options contracts nowavailable.   &quot;It's completely an over-the-counter market now, and theprices are unreliable,&quot; says Anthony Glickman, managingdirector of Intermarket Capital Association in New York.&quot;Whenever you have an exchange market for something, itimproves the price reliability.&quot;   ---                       New Contracts                                                                                                                  Planned &quot;cross-rate&quot; currency futures                                                                                                                       CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE          (International Monetary Market division)                                                                                                          CONTRACT                         SIZE                                                                                                        *Mark vs. Pound       $50,000 times IMM mark/pound rate                                                                                                        *Yen vs. Mark         $125,000 times IMM yen/mark rate                                                                                                        *Swiss Franc vs.      $125,000 times IMM Swiss franc/ Mark                  mark rate                                                                                                        Yen vs. Pound         $50,000 times IMM yen/pound rate                                                                                                        Swiss Franc vs.       $50,000 times IMM Swiss franc/ Pound                 pound rate                                                                                                        Yen vs. Swiss Franc   $125,000 times IMM Yen/Swiss rate                                                                                                                       TWIN CITIES BOARD OF TRADE                                                                                                        Pound vs. Mark        50,000 British pounds                                                                                                          *Likely the first to begin trading on Chicago Merc.</TEXT></DOC>
