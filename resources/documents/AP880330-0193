Richard L. Armitage, assistant secretary for internationalsecurity affairs, also praised the capture Tuesday of several topcommunist rebel leaders in the Philippines, saying, ``This has tohave a devastating effect on the morale'' of the New People's Army.   Armitage told a congressional subcommittee hearing that he found``dramatic differences'' during a recent visit to Manila, comparedto one 18 months earlier.   He said President Corazon Aquino's government now has people whogenuinely care about the health of the nation. The debate inManila, he said, is no longer over whether the president willsurvive coup attempts but how successful she will be during therest of her term, which ends in 1992.   Asked by Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., whether there has been anySoviet support for the rebels, Armitage said, ``In terms ofequipment, none. In terms of money, sure.''   In the first public claim by an administration official thatthere is Soviet support for Philippine rebels, Armitage said Sovietmoney goes to the Communist Party of the Philippines and is thenfunneled to the New People's Army. He gave no other details.   Armitage said that the up to 16,000 armed and another 10,000unarmed rebels also receive money from groups in Europe, Australia,New Zealand and the United States, and they are known to have helddiscussions with North Korean and Vietnamese representatives.   No outside group is known to have sent arms to the rebels sincea shipment of about 150 weapons by the Palestine LiberationOrganization in the early 1980s, he said.   The defense official said growth of the insurgency has beenabout 2 percent annually, compared to 20 percent during the lastyear of President Ferdinand E. Marcos' regime, which was replacedby Mrs. Aquino's government in a February 1986 revolt.   He noted that no American servicemen have been killed in thePhilippines since two American airmen and a retired U.S. soldierwere gunned down last October.   Communist rebels claimed responsibility for the killings andsaid more U.S. soldiers would be killed. But Armitage said hebelieves it was the work of a local rebel group that backfired andnot the result of a communist central committee policy.   Assistant Secretary of State Gaston J. Sigur appeared before theAppropriations subcommittee on foreign operations to defendadministration proposals for $257 million in aid for fiscal 1989.This is $90 million less than Congress appropriated for thePhilippines last year.   Sigur noted there are also congressional proposals for theUnited States to lead an international effort to raise $5 billionfor the Philippines over the next five years.   He also pointed to the possibility of additional aid inconnection with the agreement allowing U.S. use of Clark Air Base,Subic Navy Base and other military facilities in the Philippines. Areview of the bases agreement begins in Manila next week, withmoney a key issue.</TEXT></DOC>
