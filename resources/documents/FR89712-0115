The regulationsare a revision of the proposed rule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 29, 1980, at 45 FR 57747.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart A_General Information</ITAG>Provisions included in the general information section apply to time deposit,demand deposit, and special zero interest State and Local Government Seriessecurities. Changes from the 1980 regulations are as follows:(1) Section 344.0(b)_The definition of the term ``government body'' isexpanded to include any entity that holds funds which are subject to thearbitrage provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.(2) Section 344.1(d)_The term ``selected'' has been added to provide fora possible change in the way subscriptions are processed by the FederalReserve Banks.(3) Section 344.1(g)_The Department reserves the right to make specialprovisions relating to subscriptions for the issuance and redemption ofsecurities when it appears likely that new or extended Treasury borrowingauthority will not be timely enacted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart B_Time Deposit Securities</ITAG>Time deposit Treasury securities are offered to State and local governmentinvestors to enable these investors to satisfy yield restrictions in theInternal Revenue Code. The major changes to the time deposit offering fromthe 1980 regulations are as follows:(1) Section 344.2(a)(1)_Certificates will be available for terms of 30days to one year. This reduces the 45-day minimum heretofore provided.(2) Section 344.2(a)(3)_The maximum term for Treasury bonds will be reducedto 30 years from 40 years.(3) Section 344.2(b)_The interest rate tables are changed from weekly tablesto daily tables.(4) Section 344.2(c)(2)_All payments of principal and interest on timedeposit securities subscribed for on or after February 1, 1987, are beingor will be made by the Automated Clearing House method (ACH) to the financialinstitution for the account of the investor.(5) Section 344.3(b)_The 20-day notice of the intention to invest is reducedto 15 calendar days. In addition, the subscriber may defer the issue dateup to seven calendar days after the date originally specified for issuance.(6) Section 344.3(b)_A subscription may be amended on or before the proposedissue date for the purpose of changing the aggregate principal amount upor down by no more than ten percent, previously five percent, and changingthe interest rate to any other rate, which does not exceed the maximumallowable rate, on the applicable table.(7) Section 344.3(c)_Subscribers must certify that none of the proceedssubmitted in payment is derived from the redemption before maturity ofother securities of the State and Local Government Series. Subscribersmust also certify that either none of the proceeds submitted in paymentis derived from the sale of escrowed open market securities or, if so,the yield of the State and Local Government Series securities being purchaseddoes not exceed the yield at which the open market securities were sold.(8) Section 344.4_The six-month penalty for failure to make settlementon a subscription is modified to provide that the penalty applies if thefailure to settle is due to a desire to take advantage of changes in interestrates, but not if the change was necessitated by an adversity in the financing.Certification to this effect is required.(9) Section 344.4_The provision allowing subscribers to cancel the issuanceof a security within 25 calendar days after the issue date is deleted.(10) Section 344.5(b)(2)_A minimum 15-calendar day notice is required onearly redemptions. This reduces the 20-day requirement previously imposedfor most early redemptions.(11) Section 344.5(b)(3)_A new subsection (b)(3) has been inserted andthe following subsections have been renumbered appropriately. The new subsection(b)(3) provides for the Treasury to pay accrued interest for any fractionalperiod since the last interest payment date, and for calculating the marketcharge for an early redemption of time deposit securities issued on orafter September 1, 1989. The market charge, which is to be computed usingthe formulas in the Appendix, will reflect the present value of the remainingstream of payments on the time deposit security in the current market.Proceeds will not be reduced by any overpayment of interest which the entitymay have received during the actual holding period as a result of havingsubscribed to a longer term security.(12) Section 344.5(b)(4)_This section was renumbered from andSection; 344.5(b)(3)to andSection; 344.5(b)(4) and changed to apply to time deposit securitiesissued from December 28, 1976, through August 31, 1989.(13) Section 344.5(b)(4)(iii)_For purposes of calculating the market chargefor an early redemption, the term ``current borrowing rate'' is changedto mean the applicable rate shown in the table of maximum interest ratespayable on State and Local Government securities for the day the requestfor early redemption is received or postmarked, rather than the week inwhich the early redemption date occurred, plus one-eighth of one percentagepoint.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart C_Demand Deposit Securities </ITAG>The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed arbitrage rebate requirements on issuersof tax-exempt bonds and directed the Department of the Treasury to modifyits State and Local Government Series (SLGS) program to accommodate thenew requirements and enable entities to invest qualifying funds in a Treasurymoney-market type investment vehicle. Accordingly, the Department expandedthe program with its 1986 regulations to include a new ``demand deposit''security offering for investing proceeds from tax-exempt bond issues. Thissecurity is not treated as investment property for purposes of sections143(g)(3) and 148 of the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, enableseligible entities to invest proceeds of tax-exempt bonds in an obligationwhich avoids the earning of rebatable arbitrage. In addition, amounts earnedfrom investing gross proceeds pursuant to Exception (6) in andSection; 344.7(b)(5)of these regulations, relating to certain amounts of less than $25,000,are not subject to arbitrage rebate. Other major features of this offering include:(1) Section 344.6(a)_The demand deposit securities are issued in a minimumamount of $1,000 and any increment above that amount. The securities, definedas one-day certificates of indebtedness, roll over each day until the dayof redemption.(2) Section 344.6(b)_Interest is computed daily. The rate is based on anadjustment of the average yield in the most recent auction of three-monthTreasury bills. Interest is accrued and added to the principal daily.(3) Section 344.6(c)_Upon determination by the Secretary of the Treasurythat the proceeds of any unredeemed demand deposit certificate may notbe reinvested because of uncertainty that new or extended debt limit legislationwill be timely enacted, the proceeds will be placed in a special interest-bearing,redeemable certificate of indebtedness, having a term of 90 days.(4) Section 344.7(a)_The securities are issued upon a minimum notice ofthree business days.(5) Section 344.7(b)(1)_Subscriptions are limited to bond issues of $35million or less.(6) Section 344.9(a)_The securities may be redeemed upon a minimum noticeof one business day.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart D_Special Zero Interest Securities </ITAG>In order to give State and local government investors greater flexibilityin investing certain proceeds that may become subject to yield restrictions,a new special zero interest security is being offered for the first timewith these 1989 regulations. Under the terms of this offering, subscribersare not required to certify that as of the date of investment all the proceedssubject to yield restrictions are being invested in State and Local Governmentsecurities. This offering is the same as that for time deposit securities,except for the following:(1) Section 344.11(a)_Only certificates of indebtedness and notes are offered.(2) Section 344.11(b)_The interest yield on the security is zero percent.(3) Section 344.12_The subscriber must certify that the investment consistsonly of original or investment proceeds of a tax-exempt bond issue thatare not proceeds of an advance refunding issue to be used to dischargeanother issue, and that the original proceeds of the tax-exempt bond issuewere not subject to arbitrage yield restrictions on the date of receiptthereof. (4) Section 344.13_No penalty shall apply for redemption of the securitybefore maturity. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Final Rule </ITAG>Background The final rule reflects changes in the interim rule, including those madefor purposes of clarification and those made in response to comments receivedto the notice of proposed rulemaking. Ten written comments were receivedon the interim regulations for United States Treasury State and Local GovernmentSeries securities. Following is a summary of the issues addressed in thecomments and an explanation of the action taken with respect thereto. Section 344.0(a) Offering of Securities One comment was received requesting that consideration be given to offeringnotes and bonds that do not pay interest until maturity. The Departmenthas not adopted this comment given that the Treasury has not traditionallyissued such securities and making such securities available to State andlocal governments is not necessary in order for these entities to complywith arbitrage yield restrictions. Section 344.0(b) Offering of Securities One comment was received related to the definition of eligible purchasersof certificates of indebtedness. The request was made that the definitionof eligible purchaser be expanded to include national banks acting in thecapacity of trustee for collateralized mortgage obligations issued underdebt instruments, and national banks acting as trustees for collectiveinvestment funds established and operated pursuant to 12 CFR 9.18. Thiscomment was for the propose of allowing investments unrelated to tax-exemptbond issues. The Department has determined that expansion of the definitionof eligible investors to include such entities and to permit such investmentsis not in keeping with the purpose and intent of the State and Local GovernmentSecurities program. The purpose of this program is to provide securitiesthat enable State and local governments to comply with arbitrage yieldrestrictions. Section 344.1(f) General Provisions One commenter recommended that the regulations state that the penalty forimproper certification or other misrepresentation by the subscriber wouldbe applied only when the pertinent certifications were not made in goodfaith. The regulations have been amended to indicate that the penalty isnot intended to apply to inadvertent error. Section 344.3(c)(1) Subscription for Purchase Several comments were received on the requirement that time deposit Stateand Local Government securities be purchased only with amounts which aresubject to yield restrictions. The recommendation was made that this requirementbe revised to read ``the total investment consists only of proceeds whichare subject to yield restrictions or arbitrage rebate requirements underthe Internal Revenue Code.'' This recommendation has not been adopted.The sole purpose of the time deposit program is to offer a below-marketrate security to enable State and local governments to comply with arbitrageyield restrictions. Allowing the investment of all bond proceeds wouldbe inconsistent with this limited purpose. Section 344.3(c)(2) Subscription for Purchase Comments were received on the requirement that all proceeds of an issuesubject to yield restrictions must be invested. One commenter suggestedthat ``proceeds'' should be defined as ``original proceeds'' or ``investmentproceeds,'' as opposed to transferred proceeds, sinking fund proceeds,replacement proceeds, collateral funds and amounts other than originalproceeds or investment proceeds deposited in a reasonably required reservefund. A statement has been added to andSection;344.0(b) to provide that thedefinitions are those adopted by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition,andSection;344.3(c) has been amended to provide that the ``all or none''rule does not apply to transferred proceeds if no portion of such proceedsis being invested. The same commenter suggested that the ``all or none'' restriction be waivedin those cases where a government investor desires to subscribe to SLGsbearing zero percent interest. In response to this and other comments expressinga need for a special exception to the ``all or none'' rule in order tofacilitate investments subject to arbitrage yield restrictions under theTax Reform Act of 1986, Subpart D, ``Special Zero Interest Securities,''has been added herein, providing for a new State and Local Government Seriessecurity offering. Section 344.4(a) Issue Date and Payment A comment was made that the provision in the regulations that the six-monthpenalty for failure to settle due to a subscriber attempting to take advantageof changes in the interest rate is unclear. The provision is intended torefer to changes in the State and Local Government Series interest rateor to changes in market interest rates. It was also stated that the regulations do not make clear how a governmentbody procedurally obtains a waiver of penalty. The Department believesthat the regulations adequately state in andSection;344.4 that waiver authoritylies with the Commissioner of the Public Debt and that a certified statementmust be submitted to the Bureau of the Public Debt to request a waiverof the six-month penalty. Section 344.6(b) Description of Securities Comments were received relative to the interest rate for demand depositsecurities. All commenters felt that the formula designed by the Treasuryto determine the weekly interest rate on demand deposit securities resultsin a rate that is too volatile and too low. Recommendations included (1)setting a rate that is an index of short-term municipal rates and is notfurther reduced by an administrative fee, and (2) basing the rate on themarket yield on Treasury bills and subtracting only the allocable costof administering the program. The interest rate formula for demand deposit securities has been changed.The new interest rate is based on an adjustment of the average yield inthe most recent auction of three-month Treasury bills, rather than an adjustmentof the Federal Funds rate. The new interest rate base is expected to resultin less volatility in the demand deposit rate. In addition, it is anticipatedthat Treasury administrative costs will be significantly reduced. Section 344.7(b) Subscription for PurchaseComments were received related to the requirement that all of the proceedsreceived upon the sale of an issue of State or local government obligationsbe invested in demand deposit securities if any of such proceeds is tobe invested therein. One commenter stated that this forces investors toinvest longer term monies in low interest rate demand deposit securitiesin order to use them at all and thereby causes large negative arbitragelosses. This commenter recommended that issuers be permitted to investpart of the proceeds in time deposit securities at an interest rate nohigher than the yield on the bond issue.In response to these comments, a change has been made to require that only25 percent of the proceeds received from the sale of the issue be investedin demand deposit securities, provided that the remainder of the proceedsare invested pursuant to one of the available exceptions. The availableexceptions have been expanded to allow issuers, for example, to investpart of the proceeds in taxable obligations with a yield no higher thanthe yield on the bond issue. In light of these and other changes to thedemand deposit program and in keeping with its limited purpose, a changehas been made to exclude very large bond issues (in excess of $35 million)from the demand deposit program.One commenter suggested that the demand deposit regulations be changedbecause investment of bond proceeds on the date of delivery is impossibleif the issuer does not get ``same day funds'' when the bonds are delivered.A change has been made in the certification requirements to make allowancefor a delay in receipt of funds.Section 344.9(c) RedemptionA comment was received related to the certification requirement for demanddeposit securities that any amount requested for redemption be expendedwithin one day of receipt thereof for the purpose of the tax-exempt bondissue used to purchase the certificate. The recommendation is to modifythat requirement so that redemption proceeds could be immediately reinvestedin time deposit securities. A more general comment was that considerablygreater flexibility should be permitted for mixing of investments amongdemand deposit SLGs and time deposit SLGs. The Department believes thatimplementing these recommendations would compromise the distinction betweenthe purpose and design of the demand deposit and time deposit programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">General</ITAG>This rule is not considered a ``major rule'' for purposes of ExecutiveOrder 12291. A regulatory impact analysis, therefore, is not required.Although public comments were solicited in conjunction with the interimregulations, the notice and public procedures requirements of the AdministrativeProcedure Act are inapplicable, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2). As no noticeof proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C 601, <T3>et seq</T3>.) do not apply.The collections of information contained in this regulation have been reviewedand approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance withthe requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507) undercontrol number 1535-0091. The estimated annual burden per respondent variesfrom 10 to 45 minutes, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimatedaverage of 15 minutes.Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestionsfor reducing this burden should be directed to Bureau of the Public Debt,Forms Management Officer, Washington, DC 20239-1300, and to the Officeof Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1535-0091), Washington,DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 344</ITAG>Bonds, Government securities, Securities.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Gerald Murphy,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Fiscal Assistant Secretary.</ITAG>Part 344 of Title 31, Code of Federal Regulations, is revised as followsand issued as Department of the Treasury Circular, Public Debt Series No.3-72, Third Revision:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 344_REGULATIONS GOVERNING UNITED STATES TREASURY CERTIFICATESOF INDEBTEDNESS_STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERIES, UNITED STATES TREASURYNOTES_STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERIES, AND UNITED STATES TREASURY BONDS_STATEAND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERIES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General Information</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.0 Offering of securities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.1 General provisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Time Deposit Securities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.2 Description of securities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.3 Subscription for purchase.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.4 Issue date and payment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.5 Redemption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Demand Deposit Securities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.6 Description of securities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.7 Subscription for purchase.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.8 Issue date and payment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.9 Redemption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Special Zero Interest Securities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.10 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.11 Description of securities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.12 Subscription for purchase.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">344.13 Redemption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix_Early Redemption Market Charge Formulas and Examples</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>31 U.S.C. 3102, <T3>et seq</T3>.; sec. 1301, Pub.

A security scheduled for redemption on a non-businessday will be redeemed on the next business day.(b) <T3>Before maturity._</T3>(1)<T3> In general.</T3> A security may be redeemed at the owner's optionno earlier than 25 calendar days after the issue date in the case of acertificate, and one year after the issue date in the case of a note orbond. Partial redemptions may be requested in multiples of $100; however,an account balance of less than $1,000 will be redeemed in total.(2) <T3>Notice. </T3>Notice for redemption prior to maturity must be submitted,by letter or wire, by the official(s) authorized to redeem the securities,as shown on the final subscription form, to the Bureau of the Public Debt,Department L, Washington, DC 20239-0101. The notice must show the accountnumber, the maturities of the securities to be redeemed, and the tax identificationnumber of the subscriber. This notice must be received no less than 15calendar days before the requested redemption date. However, owners areencouraged to provide as much notice of redemption as possible to assurethat payment can be timely made. Once received, a notice of redemptionprior to maturity cannot be cancelled.(3) <T3>Redemption proceeds_subscriptions on or after September 1, 1989. </T3>Forsecurities subscribed for on or after September 1, 1989, the amount ofthe redemption proceeds is calculated as follows:(i) <T3>Interest. </T3>If a security is redeemed before maturity on a dateother than a scheduled interest payment date, interest will be paid forthe fractional interest period since the last interest payment date.(ii) <T3>Market charge. </T3>An amount shall be deducted from the redemptionproceeds in all cases where the current borrowing rate of the Departmentof the Treasury for the remaining period to original maturity of the securityprematurely redeemed exceeds the rate of interest originally fixed forsuch security. The amount shall be the present value of the future increasedborrowing cost to the Treasury. The annual increased borrowing cost foreach interest period is determined by multiplying the principal by thedifference between the two rates. For notes and bonds, the increased borrowingcost for each remaining interest period to original maturity is determinedby dividing the annual cost by two. For certificates, the increased borrowingcost for the remaining period to original maturity is determined by multiplyingthe annual cost by the number of days remaining until original maturitydivided by the number of days in the calendar year. Present value shallbe determined by using the current borrowing rate as the discount factor.The term ``current borrowing rate'' means the applicable rate shown inthe table of maximum interest rates payable on United States Treasury securities_Stateand Local Government Series_for the day the request for early redemptionis received or, where mailed, the postmark date, plus one-eighth of onepercentage point. Where redemption is requested as of a date less than30 calendar days before the original maturity date, such applicable rateis the rate shown for a security with a maturity of 30 days. The marketcharge for bonds, notes, and certificates of indebtedness can be computedby use of the formulas set forth in the Appendix to this Part 344.(4) <T3>Redemption proceeds_subscriptions from December 28, 1976 through August31, 1989. </T3>For securities subscribed for from December 28, 1976 throughAugust 31, 1989, the amount of the redemption proceeds is calculated asfollows:(i) <T3>Interest.</T3> Interest for the entire period the security was outstandingshall be recalculated on the basis of the lesser of the original interestrate at which the security was issued, or the interest rate that wouldhave been set at the time of the initial subscription had the term forthe security been for the shorter period. If a note or bond is redeemedbefore maturity on a date other than a scheduled interest payment date,no interest will be paid for the fractional interest period since the lastinterest payment date.(ii) <T3>Overpayment of interest. </T3>If there have been overpayments of interest,as determined under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, there shall bededucted from the redemption proceeds the aggregate amount of such overpayments,plus interest, compounded semiannually, thereon from the date of each overpaymentto the date of redemption. The interest rate to be used in calculatingthe interest on the overpayment shall be one-eighth of one percent abovethe maximum rate that would have applied to the initial subscription hadthe term of the security been for the shorter period.(iii) <T3>Market charge. </T3>An amount shall be deducted from the redemptionproceeds in all cases where the current borrowing rate of the Departmentof the Treasury for the remaining period to original maturity of the securityprematurely redeemed exceeds the rate of interest originally fixed forsuch security.

The adjusted interest rate is the Treasury rate which wouldhave been in effect on the date of issuance for a marketable Treasury certificate,note, or bond maturing on the quarterly maturity date prior to redemption(in the case of certificates), or on the semiannual maturity period priorto redemption (in the case of notes and bonds), reduced in either caseby a penalty which shall be the lesser of (A) One-eighth of one percent times the number of months from the dateof issuance to original maturity, divided by the number of full monthselapsed from the date of issue to redemption, or (B) One-fourth of one percent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">There shall be deducted from the redemption proceeds, if necessary,any overpayment of interest resulting from previous payments made at ahigher rate based on the original longer period to maturity.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number1535-0091)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart C_Demand Deposit Securities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 344.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Description of securities.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Terms. </T3>The securities are defined as one-day certificates of indebtedness.The securities will be issued in a minimum of $1,000 and any incrementabove that amount.
