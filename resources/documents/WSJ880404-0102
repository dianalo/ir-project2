The drop in the rate, from 5.7% of the civilian work force in February, brings it to its lowest level since May 1979, when it was also 5.6%, the Labor Department said.    The report provides particularly good news for Republican candidates, as it's the firmest indication to date that a recession isn't imminent in this election year. In fact, most analysts expect economic growth to pick up somewhat in the second quarter, with consumer confidence recovered from the impact of the stock market crash and export growth continuing. On the other hand, interest rates in the financial markets have been pushed up recently by fears of inflation, and this report isn't likely to offer any reassurance on that score.    Separately, the Commerce Department said a drop in home building pulled construction spending down 0.3% in February after a 2.8% decline in January. Non-residential building rose 1.2% after a 2.3% decline.    The strongest figure in the employment report was the increase of 262,000 in non-farm payrolls. It followed a huge February rise of 517,000, revised down only slightly from 531,000. Service and construction industries showed impressive gains.    Some other signs were less clear, however. &quot;This report is definitely a plus for the economy,&quot; said Robert Wescott, vice president at Alphametrics Corp. in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. &quot;But it's a bit quirky.&quot; The job growth was uneven; manufacturing employment actually fell by 1,000 after a 17,000-job rise the month before. The average factory workweek was down to 40.9 hours from 41, with overtime unchanged at 3.7 hours. Overall, weekly hours fell to 34.6 from 34.8.    In addition, the payroll increase conflicted with a 306,000 drop in employment that showed up in the Labor Department's household survey, which is used in calculating the unemployment rate. The drop, which followed a 280,000-job increase in February, was accompanied by a contraction in the labor force. Economists generally pay more attention to the payroll numbers, but some expressed concern about the divergence between the two measures in the latest report.    Despite the weakness in factory jobs and overall hours, average hourly earnings rose to $9.19 in March from $9.13 in February. The department's hourly earnings index, which excludes wage changes caused by factory overtime and shift differentials, rose to 177.1% of its 1977 average from 176.5%. Moreover, the rate itself could reignite some inflation fears, by continuing to drop below a level that some economists consider &quot;full employment.&quot;    &quot;This will add to the concern,&quot; in the markets and at the Federal Reserve Board, said James Cochrane, chief economist at Texas Commerce Bancshares in Houston. &quot;It's an indicator that wage pressure may be there.&quot;    In the service sector, jobs increased 178,000 after a 380,000-job rise in February. The finance industry, continuing to show effects of the stock market crash, lost jobs for the second month in a row. Goods-producing employment, which includes mining and construction as well as manufacturing, gained 84,000 jobs after a 137,000job increase.    Using a measure that counts the military among the employed, the jobless rate fell to 5.5% from 5.6%.    February's drop in construction outlays brought them to a $391.5 billion annual rate from a $392.5 billion pace in January. Spending was 2.5% below a year earlier. Residential outlays fell 1.1% after a 2.3% drop.    The figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal variation. After adjustment for inflation, construction spending fell 0.7% to a $341.1 billion rate and was down 4% from a year earlier.     ---   Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employment report.
