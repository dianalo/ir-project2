Fuel microstructural changes due tozirconium migration, anisotropic swelling, and thermal variations areall important consequences that must be modeled through input variationsto the fission gas code used for this work. Completion of this steady-statemodeling has resulted in the benchmarking of a detailed transient fissiongas model that could be applied to the prediction of off-normal fuelbehavior.</TEXT></DOC>
