Theoscillation means include at least one pitman rotatably connected atone end thereof to the opposite end of the walking beam, a crank armrotatably connected to the pitman at the other end thereof, a motor drivenspindle for rotating the crank arm in circular fashion, a counterweightattached to the crank arm for rotation in circular fashion therewith,the center of gravity of the counterweight lying in a straight line directionalong the axis of the crank arm. The axis of the rotatable connectionbetween the crank arm and the the pitman intersects the straight linedirection at a right angle, the pumping unit having a distance A extendingfrom the axis B of the rotatable support for the walking beam to a pointof tangency on the outer surface of the arc which lies in the directionof the well string, a distance C extending from B to the axis D of therotatable connection of the pitman to the walkin gbeam, a distance Pextending from D to the axis E of the rotatable connection of the pitmanto the crank arm, a distance R from E to the axis F of the motor drivenspindle, a distance I extending from F in a horizontal direction to apoint L at the intersection of a vertical direction with the axis ofthe rotatable support for the walking beam, a distance G from F to theground, a distance H-G from B to L, and a distance K from F to B.</TEXT></DOC>
