Blowing snow driven by winds gusting to over 100 mph in someareas dropped visibility to zero, closing schools in Montana andNorth Dakota and briefly shutting down a Minnesota highway.   Balmy weather that set records for warmth in many cities endedabruptly in Montana, where Great Falls dropped to 10 degrees belowzero Tuesday morning, after Monday's record high of 62, the NationalWeather Service said.   Helena, Mont., plummeted from 44 degrees at 6 a.m. Tuesday to 6below zero at 8 a.m. Wind chill factors plunged to near 80 degreesbelow zero in parts of the state and East Glacier had 6 inches ofsnow by mid-morning, the weather service said. By afternoon much ofthe state was below zero.   The agency issued a blizzard warning for the eastern slopes ofthe Rockies in Montana and warned: ``This is a very dangerous stormand anyone caught outdoors will be in grave danger in the warningareas.''   In the town of Cut Bank, about 100 miles north of Helena, thetemperature plunged 23 degrees in one minute, and 103 mph windsdropped the wind chill to 75 below zero. By 7 p.m., it was 22degrees below zero.   ``It was a drastic drop, really fast,'' said Glacier Countyundersheriff Bill Barron.   But ahead of the cold air, high temperature records were brokenor tied Tuesday in 64 cities from Colorado to Ohio and from northernTexas into southern Minnesota. Dodge City, Kan., soared to 80degrees, surpassing the record of 76 set in 1911; Chicago climbed to65, breaking its 1877 record of 56; Louisville, Ky., hit 67, alsobreaking a 112-year-old record; Detroit climbed to 60, breaking themark of 54 degrees set in 1890; Grand Island, Neb., reached 72; andFort Smith, Ark., hit 77.   Cold air from Siberia was trapped over Alaska by a dome ofextremely high atmospheric pressure. The barometer at Northway,Alaska, rose to a record high of 31.74 inches of mercury, theweather service reported Tuesday.   The previous North American record was Monday, at 31.54 inches atBig Delta, Alaska, which toppled the old record of 31.53 measured inCanada's Yukon Territory in January 1974. By contrast, hurricaneGilbert had the lowest recorded pressure in the Western Hemisphereat 26.22 inches on Sept. 13.   ``This is the highest, coldest record-breaking system in the past100 years,'' said meteorologist Wally Younker in Anchorage.   Alaska's overnight low was 62 below zero at Eagle and Northwaynear the Canadian border, and the wind chill in the Bethel area fellto 80 below early Tuesday.   Temperatures of minus 40 kept schools closed for a second day inFairbanks and Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper ordered all non-essentialstate workers in the city to stay home until the cold spell snaps.   Schools also were closed a second day in the Matanuska-SusitnaValley north of Anchorage because of wind chills to 50 below. Snowdrifts up to 4 feet were reported at the intersection of the Parksand Glenn highways. Heavy ice in Cook Inlet hampered barge trafficbetween Nikiski refineries and coastal villages that need fuel.   Juneau chilled only to 11 below zero early Tuesday, but AlaskaElectric Light and Power Co. asked people to conserve electricity toavoid rotating blackouts. An avalanche last week downed the powerline to the city's hydroelectric dam, and one of the city's twoauxiliary diesel-fired generators failed.   The Montana Highway Department advised emergency travel onlyTuesday on most highways from Helena north to the Canadian border.North Dakota authorities advised no travel in the northeastern partof the state, including Interstate 29, because of blowing anddrifting snow. Twenty-six miles of U.S. 2 in northwestern Minnesotawere closed by blinding, blowing snow.   Wind gusting to 86 mph pushed ahead of the cold air crossingWyoming on Tuesday, ripping porches from houses and destroying anempty mobile home, said Dan Dennis, chief of the Lander Rural FireDepartment.   In Washington state, crews were in the process of restoring powerto more than 100,000 customers in Island, Snohomish and Skagitcounties where high winds felled utility lines.   Forecasters in North Dakota said the Siberian blast could lastuntil mid-February and predicted overnight lows this weekend of 20to 40 below zero.   High wind knocked down utility poles, cutting off power inscattered areas in northwestern Montana and along the eastern slopesof the Rocky Mountains, and utilities said their repair crews werestruggling in the cold.   ``They can't hardly stand to work in it,'' said Cal Hatch, linesuperintendent with Sun River Electric Co-op Inc. near Great Falls.   Some Montana schools stayed open Tuesday because they fearedsending children back home in the bitter cold. School District 1 inHelena said children who couldn't be taken directly home by bus orwould be home alone would be taken back to school to await theirparents.   Some orchardists in Washington state fired up smudge pots to savethe nation's largest cherry crop and the second-largest apricotcrop, both of which were just beginning to bud. The state's fruitindustry is worth $540 million.   ``All that weather you have been reading about in Alaska andCanada's Yukon will plunge southward,'' warned weather servicemeteorologist John Jannuzzi in Seattle.   No deaths or injuries directly attributable to the cold had beenreported in Alaska. There has been speculation, by the governor andothers, that icy fog may have contributed to Sunday's crash of aCanadian military plane that killed eight men.</TEXT></DOC>
