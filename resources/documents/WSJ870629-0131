Getty Petroleum Corp.    The Thursday before last, a federal court jury awarded Getty Petroleum $9.3 million in compensatory and punitive damages in a trademark-infringement suit. The defendants -- including operators of three Getty stations in New York -- were found guilty of selling non-Getty gasoline.    Getty -- which is unrelated to Getty Oil Co. -- and its outside counsel in the case were ecstatic. Not only did the jury's award strike a blow against those who sold the &quot;bootleg gasoline,&quot; as the company put it, but the punitive damages were $4 million more than Getty had sought.    &quot;I guess they liked us better than they liked them,&quot; Robert G. Del Gadio, Getty's lawyer, said of the jurors. &quot;When you ask somebody for $5 million and they give you $9 million, you don't ask questions.&quot;    Maybe he should have. While Getty was celebrating, Judge Jacob Mishler was doing what judges do in cases like this -- reviewing the jury's award. And last Monday, shortly after Getty issued a news release on the award, the judge reduced the judgment by some 90% -- to $946,000.    Mr. Del Gadio says the company will fight the reduction and he contends that once the jury decided the award, &quot;the liability had been fixed.&quot; As for the news release touting the award? Well, says Leo Liebowitz, Getty's president and chief executive, &quot;If we knew, we would not have done anything this soon.&quot;    What's One Letter?   Maybe it's time for Datagram Inc. to change its name. Two years ago, brokers at one of Canada's largest securities firms recommended that clients sell shares in the small Montreal maker of data-communications equipment after they read a news-wire report that they believed reported a loss for the company.    As it turned out, the news concerned Dataram Corp., a New Jersey-based maker of computer memories. The brokers had simply got the names confused.    A week ago Friday, it happened again. This time, when Dataram reported its earnings, the Montreal Gazette added a &quot;g&quot; and reported the results under the headline &quot;Datagram's fourth-quarter profit plunges.&quot;    The confusion was all the more frustrating for Pierre Pharand, Datagram's president, because the company was just about to report a big profit turnaround for its own fiscal fourth quarter ended May 31.    Although Datagram's stock didn't move much on the mistaken news, Mr. Pharand says twice is too much. He's considering a new name for the company.    All in the Family   Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. might consider acting real friendly to its sister company, General Electric Credit Corp.    On June 5, GE Credit took out big ads in several business publications touting its investment in R.H. Macy andamp; Co., which went private in a leveraged buyout a year ago. &quot;Seeing things differently has enabled GE Credit to become a leader not only in LBOs, but in . . . almost every other aspect of business financing,&quot; the ad said.    The timing, however, was less than perfect. GE Credit was unaware that newspapers on June 5 would also carry reports that the R.H. Macy deal was one of several transactions on which the government accused Kidder, 80%-owned by General Electric Co., of making illegal profits by using inside information. While Kidder avoided criminal indictment on the charges and settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it already faces one private civil suit.    Will GE Credit be among those suing Kidder? No comment, says a GE Credit spokesman. He says the financial concern intends to keep running the R.H. Macy ad. Still, he adds: &quot;I see the irony.&quot;    Phantom Fliers   The U.S. Mint touts its American Eagle gold coins as one investment &quot;you can actually hold.&quot;    Trouble is, you can't get your hands on much printed information about the eight-month-old coin. A series of snags, it seems, have held back the launch of an important selling tool: the coin's marketing fliers.    First, the Mint says, it couldn't match the gold color on the brochure with the coin's true gold tint. Then, as the pamphlets were set in their final production galleys, an objection arose over the wording of a sentence. Then when the change was translated for the brochure's foreign-language editions, grammatical problems cropped up. The result: The brochure's publication set for early this year has been pushed back. And back. Now the Mint says it will be available in about a month.    &quot;It's a no-win situation,&quot; says Donna Pope, Mint director. &quot;If we put out brochures that looked like garbage, we would have had people criticizing us for that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
