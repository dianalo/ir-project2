Against other currrencies, the dollar fell on comments -- which the White House said didn't represent its views -- by a Commerce Department official.    The British unit was aided yesterday by speculation that Britain's central bank opposes a cut in interest rates by commercial banks. Sterling's rise has been sparked in part by investors rushing to take advantage of Britain's high interest rates.    The pound's trading volume continued to outpace the usually more-active market involving the dollar and the yen and West German mark.    &quot;Sterling has been the country cousin to the yen and the mark, but sentiment is shifting toward sterling,&quot; said Anthony J. Murphy, senior sterling trader at Royal Bank of Canada, New York.    Separately, the dollar fell after Robert Ortner, the undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, told a U.S. ExportImport Bank conference that the yen &quot;is still a little bit undervalued&quot; against the dollar and ought to rise a further 10% to 15%. Mr. Ortner also said he believes the dollar &quot;is fairly priced&quot; against the West German mark and other European currencies.    The Reagan administration, however, quickly said Mr. Ortner's opinions are his own and didn't reflect the views of the administration -- particularly in the wake of the accord the U.S. signed with other major industrial nations two weeks ago that asserted that the dollar had declined enough.    A spokesman for Treasury Secretary James Baker tersely referred questioners to a White House statement of January that said &quot;only . . . the president and the secretary of the Treasury . . . are authorized to speak on the dollar.&quot; That sentiment was endorsed by a Commerce Department spokesman.    &quot;Nevertheless, the damage was done,&quot; said Daniel E. Holland, a trader at Discount Corp. of New York. The dollar fell to 1.8340 marks in late New York trading, in contrast to its intraday high of 1.8460 yesterday and down from 1.8421 Wednesday. The dollar also fell to 153.33 yen from an intraday high of 154.28 and from 153.76 Wednesday.    In early trading in Tokyo Friday the dollar rose against the Japanese currency to 153.45 yen from 153.33 in New York yesterday afternoon.    Shirgeru Tokunaga, vice president and foreign-exchange manager at Fuji Bank Ltd., New York, said Mr. Ortner's remarks &quot;triggered the selling&quot; of dollars. However, he added, at the time the U.S. currency was &quot;overbought,&quot; and many dealers sought to deplete their dollar positions ahead of today's U.S. employment report.    Throughout the day, the dollar remained confined to the same narrow range in which it has traded since the meeting of industrialized nations.    Traders attributed sterling's surge yesterday to the Bank of England's repurchase of $31.7 million of short-term bills for resale to the market at a rate of 10 15/16%. That was well above most money-market rates, and appeared to signal that there won't be a cut soon in Britain's base lending rate, which is currently 11%.    The base rate is used by British commercial banks to set lending rates. The central bank helps determine the base right by influencing money-market rates, as it did yesterday.    A cut in the base rate, which had been believed to be in the offing, would make sterling-denominated investments relatively less attractive and, in turn, would reduce demand for the currency. The central bank's apparent opposition to lowering the base rate added to sterling's momentum yesterday, traders said, as investors were attracted to interest rates that are already several points above those found in the U.S., West Germany and Japan for similar investments.    In late New York trading yesterday, the pound stood at $1.5838, up from $1.5644 Wednesday. Sterling also climbed to 242.84 yen from 240.54, and to 2.9047 marks from 2.8818.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery fell $3.20 an ounce, to $407.20, in brisk trading. The estimated volume was 4.7 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $407.90 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                    CURRENCY RATES                        New York   Home Mkt.
