Such cross-border transactions in the first quartertotaled 785, down 45% from a year earlier and 41% from the1990 fourth quarter, according to a survey by the accountingfirm KPMG Peat Marwick. The value of the deals --acquisitions, minority stakes and joint ventures -- declined59% to $14.64 billion.   Of the three categories, joint ventures showed thesmallest year-to-year fall, 33% to 271, but their value grew77% to $1.76 billion. This suggests some investors usedventures to minimize costs and risks in cross-border deals,KPMG said.   The overall decline in these transactions was attributedto strains on the world economy resulting from the PersianGulf War, high levels of banking defaults, Eastern Europe'sferment and interest-rate pressures. The downturn is likelyto be temporary, KPMG said, with a rebound coming asfundamental factors strengthen, such as the approach ofEurope's barrier-free market at the end of 1992 and thebottoming out of recessions in Britain and the U.S.                                                                                                          DEFECTS AT BULGARIAN REACTOR                                                                                                          Bulgaria's only nuclear power plant has hazardous defects,the International Atomic Energy Agency said. The problemswere found in a recent three-week review of the Kozluduyreactor's four units, two of which are shut down. The UnitedNations regulatory agency said the Soviet-built plant, 125miles north of Sofia, is &quot;in very poor condition.&quot;                                                                                                          BRITISH BUSINESS FAILURES                                                                                                          Britain's recession shoved 23,161 businesses out ofexistence in the first half, Dun andamp; Bradstreet Ltd. said. Thefailures -- at a rate of 890 a week -- were concentratedamong companies with fewer than 100 employees. The EastMidlands had 1,055 failures, up 88% from a year earlier. Inthe southwest, 2,590 companies collapsed, up 87.8%.                                                                                                          COOLNESS ON GLOBAL WARMING                                                                                                          The first session of United Nations negotiations onlimiting global warming ended in Geneva with few tangibleresults. Countries ranging from the U.S. to the Soviet Unionto Saudi Arabia and Japan all oppose in one way or anotherthe commitments sought by most European nations to limit orcut carbon dioxide pollution, identified as a major cause ofthe global rise in temperatures. Given this resistance,environmentalists questioned whether a treaty could beproduced for a Brazil summit next June.                                                                                                          LAST `CHUNNEL' PASSAGE LINKED                                                                                                          The last of three 31-mile passages beneath the EnglishChannel that will link Britain and France by rail has beencompleted, after more than three years of work. The firsttunnel, a service passage, was completed in December, and thenorthbound rail tunnel on May 22. The southbound tunnel wasfinished three months ahead of schedule in the $12.8 billion&quot;Chunnel&quot; project. Service is to start in June 1993 betweenFolkestone, England, and Calais, France. Channel Tunneltrains will travel between London and Paris in 3 1/2 hours,about half the current time for a train-and-ferry crossing.                                                                                                          LARGEST FOREIGN AID DONORS                                                                                                          Japan fell to second place behind the U.S. on the list offoreign economic aid donors in 1990, partly because the yenfell in value, Tokyo said. In 1989, Japan provided $8.97billion to poor countries, passing the U.S. with $7.7billion. Last year, Japan disbursed a record $9.24 billion inofficial development assistance and the U.S. about $10billion, according to preliminary data compiled by theParis-based Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment. France ranked third, giving $6.5 billion.                                                                                                          COMECON PROBLEMS LINGER                                                                                                          Though members of the outmoded Soviet-led trading blocterminated the 42-year-old organization, their work isn'tdone. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or Comecon,must sort out its financial and legal affairs.   Comecon property will be appraised and its fate decidedwithin three months, when the group will legally cease toexist.   Assets include the International Investment Bank, theInternational Economic Cooperation Bank, the Moscowheadquarters building and other real estate. Eastern Europeanstates want the headquarters -- valued at as much as $500million -- to be shared by former Comecon states' chambers ofcommerce and business representatives; Moscow wants to buy itfor $23 million.   Cooperation among the European members could continue in aconsultative forum but this hasn't been decided. The membercountries were the Soviet Union, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria,Czechoslovakia, Poland, Mongolia, Vietnam and Cuba.

Taiwan decided to lift its ban on Chinese newspapers andfilms if Beijing agrees to reciprocate. Taipei also easedrules for visits by journalists from China, who until now hadto renounce their Communist Party membership before enteringTaiwan. . . . Finland, one of the staunchest opponents ofSouth Africa's apartheid policies, will end trade sanctionsagainst Pretoria today, but a ban on investments in andmonetary credits to South Africa will remain in force.</TEXT></DOC>
