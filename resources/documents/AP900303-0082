It was a rousing comeback to Japan for the 47-year-oldMcCartney. The last time he tried to tour Japan he was arrestedbefore even leaving the airport after customs officials found 219grams of marijuana among his belongings.   The ex-Beatle was held for 10 days before he was expelled andbanned from ever returning. But based on his clean record for thepast five years, he was granted special permission by the JusticeMinistry to perform.   McCartney said at a news conference Thursday he now would tellpeople ``be straight and stay natural and don't use any drugs orstimulants or booze.''   After playing ``Band on the Run'' from his days with his oldband Wings, McCartney told the crowd he would take them ``to a veryfaraway place called the 60s,'' and whipped off ``The Long andWinding Road,'' ``Can't Buy Me Love'' and ``Sgt. Pepper's LonelyHearts Club Band.''   McCartney's world tour started in Oslo, Norway, last Septemberand has taken him through Britain, continental Europe and theUnited States. From Japan, the band travels to Australia, back tothe United States, to Brazil and finishes in Europe in April.</TEXT><DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn.
