Internal friction, amplitude-dependentlosses and of the module defect are shown to reduce as a result of thistreatment, while electron mobility grows. The results may be explainedby ultrasound stimulated diffusion of crystal point defects to dislocations,small-angle boundaries and other sinks, that manifests in improvementof acoustic and electric properties.</TEXT></DOC>
