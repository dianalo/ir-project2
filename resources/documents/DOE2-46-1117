The plan for overall strengtheningof safety measures include the improvement of nuclear safety controladministration, promotion of safety studies, strengthening of disasterprevention measures, improvement of radiation injury prevention measures,ensuring of environmental safety and ensuring of safety of radioactivesubstance transportation. To establish the nuclear fuel cycle, measuresshould be carried out for the securing of uranium resources and enricheduranium, re-processing of sepent fuel, utilization of recovered uraniumand disposal of radioactive wastes. Fast breeder reactors and new typesof converter reactors should be developed and techniques for plutoniumfuel processing should also be developed. Activities are required topromote leading projects including nuclear fusion research, radiationutilization R and D of nuclear powered ships, etc. Other various measuresshould also be carried out to promote development of fundamental techniques,international cooperation, location of nuclear power generation sitesand nuclear energy R and D sites, etc. Rough estimations of costs requiredfor these measures are tabulated.
