The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s cash advance on Thursdayhelped calm jittery depositors and slow runoff of deposits that hasdrained an undisclosed amount of reserves from the ailing company,bank spokesman Joseph C. Bowles said.   ``As soon as the FDIC action was made available to the public,the deposit outflow stopped,'' Bowles said.   In Washington, FDIC Chairman William Seidman said his agency wastalking to private investors about participating in a restructuringof the company, as a long-term solution to First RepublicBank'sproblems.   In a move intended to stem any ripple effect on the bankingsystem as a whole, Seidman also pledged his agency to fully protectall depositors of the banks as well as general creditors.   That goes beyond the minimum the agency normally would beexpected to insure, which is deposits of $100,000 and less.   The promise covers money borrowed overnight from other banks byFirst RepublicBank to meet the cash rules of the Federal ReserveBoard. However, it does not apply to the holding company and itsbond and note holders.   ``The action today confirms that all depositors and othergeneral creditors of First RepublicBank's banks will be fullyprotected,'' said Gerald Fronterhouse, First RepublicBank'schairman and chief executive.   Bowles and other bank officials refused Thursday to say how muchof the company's deposits had been withdrwan since Tuesday when itannounced its decision to seek federal help.   Last month, the bank lost $600 million in deposits over afive-day period amid rumors that it was in danger because ofbillions of dollars in bad loans, particularly in real estate.   But several customers at the company's lead bank in downtownDallas indicated they were not worried about losing their deposits.   ``I have confidence in the people running the bank. It'llsurvive,'' said Alex Cochrane.   Gail Scott said: ``It's pretty scary. I hope they can work itout.''   A woman who declined to identify herself said she wasn't worriedbecause the FDIC insures accounts up to $100,000, and ``before theygo under I will have spent my money.''   An Associated Press reporter was escorted out of the bank underguard Thursday as he tried to interview customers and bankofficials.   George Reagan, investment manager of the Texas TeachersRetirement System, a major institutional investor that holds498,000 shares of First RepublicBank stock, said the FDIC moneywould provide a cushion for the bank until the economy recovers.   ``This will allow First Republic to get through the hard times.No one, especially First Republic, realized that we would gothrough such a hard time with the Texas real estate market for solong,'' he said.   H.R. ``Bum'' Bright, owner of the Dallas Cowboys and Bright BancSavings Association, is the company's largest individual investorwith more than 1 million shares.   Nine months ago, those shares were worth $24 million; nowthey're worth approximately $1.5 million. Bright did not returnrepeated telephone calls on Thursday.   State Treasurer Ann Richards said the federal action ``assuresthat all depositors, including the state treasury, are safe.''   First RepublicBank is one of four state treasury clearing banks,and as of Wednesday held $152 million in state deposits. Ms.Richards said the deposits are fully collateralized and thereforeprotected.</TEXT></DOC>
