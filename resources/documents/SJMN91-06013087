It seems all but inevitable, and a sense of dread is descending on thecountry as the realization sets in.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THIS IS AMERICA -- BROKE AND BROKEN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Points of View;  Donald Kaul is a syndicated columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Less mesmerizing but significant was the story that the recession will add$50 billion to our budget deficit in the coming year.;    Nor does theestimate count the money we're stealing from Social Security and other trustfunds. It looks as though we'll be spending half again as much as we take in,adding more than $400 billion to the national debt.;    Was it only threemonths ago that Congress went through the melodrama of achieving the &quot;greatestdeficit-reduction package in the history of the republic?&quot; Now we are facedwith the greatest budget deficit in the history of the republic.;   Meanwhile, the federal government seized the financially exhausted Bank of NewEngland Corp. and said it would protect all of its banks' depositors, at anestimated cost to U.S. taxpayers' of $2.3 billion.;    Pan Am filed forbankruptcy. There are only five international airlines in the world that arein financial trouble. All of them are American.;    Every day brought yetanother story about a governor of a major state facing huge budget deficits.;   On Capitol Hill, the story of the Keating Five continued to provide us withthe blueprints of the mess we find ourselves in.;    Nothing quite comparedwith the appearance before the committee of Sen. Donald Riegle of Michigan. Hecouldn't remember saying anything at meetings with Savings and Loan banditCharles Keating, nor could he remember the meetings. It was, perhaps, the mostcomprehensive public memory loss since Jimmy Hoffa forgot he was a gangster.Riegle's attorney had an explanation. He said that his client suffered from a&quot;general disability&quot; in remembering details.;    The disability, he said,&quot;applies to virtually all of Sen. Riegle's past activity, regardless ofsubject.&quot;;    As why should it not? An inability to remember the recent pastis the great illness of our time, the entire nation is afflicted.;    Whyshould we hold so universal a failing against one poor senator trying to makehis way in a cruel and expensive world?;    We spent the decade of the '80sled by a man with no more memory than a goose and we loved every minute of it.Freed from the burdens of the past we felt at liberty to act without regardfor the future. It was said that President Reagan's great accomplishment wasin making us feel better about ourselves. And so it was, alas.;    We spent 10years sowing the wind. Now we are reaping the whirlwind.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Donald Kaul column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910113  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  484  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, January 13, 199100013087,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
