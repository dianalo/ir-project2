Concentrations were highest in areas adjacent tothose where deposition over land was highest, but they declined quicklyand did not reach radiologically significant levels in therms of publicradiation exposure. Subsequently, the distribution in seawater was investigatedfurther afield. Radio-caesium attributable to the Chernobyl accidentwas found to be widespread: it was readily distinguished from other sourcesby having a different /sup 137/Cs:/sup 134/Cs ratio (about 2:1). Itspresence was especially noticeable in northern UK waters rather thanthose to the south; much of the North Sea has been surveyed as well asthe Norwegian Sea. Evidence of Chernobyl radiocaesium was found as farnorth as 70/sup 0/ N and in many of these areas, including the northernNorth Sea, it overshadowed the effect of BNFL (British Nuclear Fuelsplc) Sellafield discharges, previously the main source of these radionuclides.</TEXT></DOC>
