The concern also said it intends to &quot;solicit potential buyers,&quot; and will hold talks not only with Mr. Bilzerian, who owns 9.99% of the approximately 10 million common shares outstanding, but also other parties who have expressed interest in the company.    As previously reported, Mr. Bilzerian made a $19-a-share proposal to acquire the stock he doesn't already own on April 2.    In Tampa, Fla., Mr. Bilzerian said he hoped to reach a confidentiality agreement with Pay 'N Pak so he will be able to obtain information to help him re-evaluate his previous offer.    Prior to the financier's late-March disclosure of his stake in the company, Pay 'N Pak's stock had been trading at just over $13 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.    In composite trading yesterday, Pay 'N Pak closed at $20.875, up $1.    Pay 'N Pak didn't identify the other parties it said have expressed interest in the specialty retailer, nor did it identify potential bidders it intends to contact.    The company also did not say what price range it would consider acceptable, and didn't give a timetable for the bidding process.    Company officials didn't return telephone calls yesterday. Marshall J. Weigel, vice chairman, reached at home, would say only, &quot;We're working in the best interests of shareholders.&quot;    Pay 'N Pak operates 107 stores in 17 states in the West and Midwest, selling do-it-yourself electrical, plumbing and building materials.    For the fiscal year ended Feb. 28, net income fell 30% to $5.7 million, or 57 cents a share, from the year earlier. Revenue rose 19% to $398.4 million.    Analysts have attributed the company's performance to competitive industry conditions, and predicted earnings will rebound to between $8 million and $9.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
