Of equal importanceto the availability and cost of personal computers is the availabilityof computer software for use on these computers. At the current timepersonal computers have excellent FORTRAN compilers and related supportingsoftware facilities and more and more application programs are beingconverted for use on personal computers. Today we have reached the pointwhere the combination of personal computer power and low cost can alloweven small institutes that cannot afford larger computers to have significantcomputer resources available for their use.</TEXT></DOC>
