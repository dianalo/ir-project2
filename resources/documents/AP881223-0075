Wearing a flannel shirt and blue jeans, he dished out venisonstew Thursday to hundreds of homeless and needy people at theSalvation Army's Champa Street Center.   Russell donated 500 pounds of the big game meat to the SalvationArmy in Denver and 500 pounds to the Rescue Mission in GrandJunction in western Colorado. He planned to go to Grand Junction toparticipate in the meal for the homeless there today.   Russell, who lives part of the year in the Colorado Rockies, saidhe wanted the hunt to ``show the reason that you take game is forproviding either for yourself or your family or, in this case, forother people, to get the message out to other hunters that we areable to maybe take some of our game and donate it to people whoreally need it.''   Nonetheless, his hunt troubled animal rights activists andtriggered a dispute over hunting licenses with state agencies.   Animal rights activists and some Hollywood celebrities took out afull page ad in the show-business publication Variety protesting thehunt.</TEXT></DOC>
