Thesedays it pays to keep such a watch.   Wage costs are beginning to hurt after nearly a decade ofrelief, and U.S. employers are being pinched on the payrollperiphery by such factors as rising health-care premiums andSocial Security taxes. The most rapid increases, however, maybe in workers' compensation expenses, now approaching $50billion a year.</LP><TEXT>   Workers' comp -- the liability for an employee injured onthe job -- is a burden varying greatly among companies,industries and states. It's four times worse in Californiathan in Indiana, for example. But the general trend is not ahappy one for business owners. In jurisdictions where costshave gotten most out of hand, some reforms have beenattempted. They aren't fundamental enough.   In some ways, the workers' comp picture resembles that ofhealth care: a rapid growth in expenditures punctuated byattempts to control costs that are followed by new breakouts.The similarity is understandable, given that the medicalcomponent of workers' comp has been rising (to about 40%)vis-a-vis the traditionally dominant payment in lieu ofwages.   Thus also expectedly, is that plaintiff lawyers and otherfee grabbers have caught wind of this honey pot and arewidening the gap between what employers pay in and employeestake out.   The rise in job-injury litigation is ironic becauseworkers' comp programs were begun in most of the states earlythis century as a no-fault way of handling industrialaccidents. Companies generally favored the approach andunions didn't. The system sufficed from an employer'sstandpoint but the benefits for injured workers didn't keeppace with rapidly rising wages after World War II. By 1972, areport to President Nixon cleared the way for big hikes inmost states. Costs rose with benefits, not simply for theobvious reason but also because, scholars seem to agree,higher payouts draw more claimants.   If that explained a leap in the '70s, the late '80s costsurge is harder to figure. Lost-pay benefits have beenratcheted higher in some states to catch up with steep wageinflation a decade ago, but other factors are at work.   Foremost is medicine, which by one forecast willconstitute half of workers' comp costs in the year 2000.Techniques for holding down treatment bills, though rapidlybeing introduced to standard employee health-care coverage,mostly aren't found in workers' comp. Some suspect thatoff-the-job ailments are increasingly being passed off aswork-incurred.   &quot;Occupational disease,&quot; including service-counter&quot;stress,&quot; has gained favor in liberal jurisdictions. Theseare less physically taxing times, but exposure to suspectedcarcinogens and other toxins is a perceived peril, while thepain of so-called carpal-tunnel syndrome, traced torepetitive hand and arm motions, is a complaint ofjournalists and other electronic-keyboard users. But,according to Cornell Prof. John Burton, who publishes thenewsletter Workers' Compensation Monitor,occupational-disease remains a tough sell in most states, asemployees must show that their last job and not the lifeleading up to it is the source of woe.   Most workers' comp claims are for short absences with aminor injury. These are the ones that seem to rise mostsurely with the benefit level. The most costly tab, however,is for what's known as permanent partial disability. Oftenthose claims are settled in large lump sums to close outopen-ended obligations. Ten years ago, it was thought thatemployers were remiss in not bringing such injured workersback into productive employment, so some states mandated&quot;vocational rehabilitation.&quot; This mainly profited providers,alas, and the mandates are being repealed.   The biggest third-party cut, not surprisingly, is going toattorneys. California is particularly beset, although Texasand Florida too have big workers' comp bars. Alan Tebb of theinsurer-funded California Workers' Compensation Institutesays 12% of all claims in that state are litigated -- 44% ofthose involving lost work time -- and he puts the &quot;frictionalcost&quot; per contested case (in lawyer fees, paid testimony fromthe &quot;dueling doctors&quot; on each side, photocopying) at $5,800as of 1988 (vs. $2,436 in 1981). A sixfold rise in litigationcosts in 10 years helps to explain why workers' comp costCalifornia employers $637 per worker in 1987, 72% above thenational mean.   Unions and some academics say lawsuits wouldn't be aproblem if employees didn't feel abandoned, if state workers'comp agencies promptly and conscientiously adjudicatedclaims. Wisconsin is praised in this respect, but usuallyappeal boards are a budgetary backwater. Indeed, in itscurrent fiscal crunch, California may target employers for anextra hit to cover administration of the program.   California also saw one of the most recent efforts toreform workers' comp, in legislation passed last year.Benefit levels were hiked while some of the other costs wereattacked. Only sketchy results are in, but previous revisionsin other states, such as in Florida at the end of the '70s,proved to have only a passing effect.   The trick is to get incentives right, to empower employeesto choose the best affordable option while discouraging themfrom malingering. One idea is to allow payroll deductionsinto a tax-deferred &quot;portable&quot; account for each employee. Thebenefits could be drawn out for certified job injuries or, ifunused, partially converted to cash at retirement.   Long-term disabilities could cause actuarial problems inthat setup, so maybe we should start with Princeton economistAlan Krueger's proposal to establish a deductible of sorts:Workers would need to be off the job 14 days before theycould collect workers' comp. Each worker would have toshoulder the burden of minor injuries -- which Mr. Kruegerthinks are more likely to be fudged -- in return for higherlong-term benefits, which he supports.   With employers, encouraging the growth of self-insurancewould discipline companies by forcing them to bear the actualcosts of their practices. (And guess what? -- workers seem toreturn to the job sooner when their boss is directly on thehook for their absence.) Meantime higher benefit levels seemto result in fewer serious injuries, presumably by proddingthe boss to maintain a safer workplace.   Workers' compensation is a classic societal safety net.The challenge is to make it available and reliable for thosewho need it by making sure the financial supports are strongand getting rid of the ballast of middle men holding it toonear the ground.</TEXT></DOC>
