The 73-year-old president and army commander made his surprisingcomment during a speech Thursday night in Puerto Varas, 620 milessouth of Santiago.   The Pinochet government has been accused of widespread humanrights abuses, including torture and killing of hundreds ofdissidents.   The Roman Catholic church and local and foreign human rightsorganizations have documented the cases of at least 700 dissidentswho disappeared after being arrested by security agents.   Pinochet and other government officials repeatedly denied theaccusations, calling them part of a communist-inspired propagandacampaign.   Pinochet's speech was carried Friday by Santiago radio stations,but pro-government newspapers did not carry the quotes related tothe human rights issue in full.   ``They accuse us of human rights abuses, they talk aboutkillings,'' Pinochet said. ``I do not say the contrary, there wereexcesses from both sides.''   He added: ``But who encouraged them? We didn't. They did. It wastheir fault.''   Jaime Castillo, president of Chile's independent Human RightsCommission, called Pinochet's speech ``positive.''   But, he added, ``there is a contradiction, when he now admits theabuses he used to deny, but at the same time blames them on thosewho were the victims of such abuses.''   Pinochet said the armed forces had to act against ``more than15,000 guerrillas'' when he led the bloody 1973 coup that toppledthe elected government of President Salvador Allende, an avowedMarxist. Allende died in the takeover.   Pinochet said that after the coup the military found illegal armscaches ``big enough to arm 35,000 men.'' He said the country hadbeen driven ``to the brink of civilian war.''   After the coup, thousands of leftists were rounded up. Humanrights groups, including the U.N. Human Rights Commission, say manywere tortured, jailed or sent into exile. An unspecified number werekilled. Others were officially reported killed in clashes withsecurity forces.   In 1978, the Pinochet government issued an amnesty favoring thoseresponsible for abuses after the coup. Opposition leaders say theyplan to investigate the abuses after Pinochet steps down next yearand punish ``those found guilty of having committed crimes.''   Pinochet is due to hand over power March 11, 1990 to the winnerin a presidential election scheduled Dec. 14.</TEXT></DOC>
