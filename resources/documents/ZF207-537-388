Inc. (Du Pont) and the process industryin general, AI and expert systems are receiving much attention.andP;  Du Pont hasan extensive program of expert-system applications, including advisory,scheduling, and process-control systems.andP;  Advisory systems encompasstroubleshooting and product-selection applications that use off-lineinformation from databases or data provided by question-and-answer keyboardinput.andP;  Scheduling systems require information on the market forecast,customer orders, and plant equipment status.andP;  They establish practicalconstraints that narrow the search space and then search for an acceptableschedule.andP;  Scheduling systems run once a day to once every several days.andO;Process-control systems include on-line expert systems that receive dataprimarily from sensor-based process monitoring and control systems andrespond in real time to process problems.andM;This article focuses on applications of sensor-based, on-line, expert-systemapplications in the process-manufacturing environment.andP;  It describes varioustypes of on-line applications, examining the potential benefits, applicationexperience, and tool requirements for implementing these applications.andP;  DuPont views these expert-system applications as extensions to rather thanreplacements of process-control technology.andM;MOTIVATION FOR APPLYING AIandM;The general demand for higher-quality domestic products is induced byworldwide competition.andP;  Improving quality requires us to have better data andanalyse it to make appropriate decisions.andM;As discussed by Laffey et al., real-time, on-line expert systems can benefitproblem-solving situations in which humans suffer from cognitive overload,fail to monitor all available information or resolve conflicting constraints,are expensive or scarce, make high-cost mistakes, miss high-revenueopportunities, or cannot simultaneously manipulate all the relevantinformation to obtain optimal solutions or provide a solution quickly enough.andO;[1]  High-revenue opportunities certainly exist in the chemical and paperindustries because many products are oversold; hence the economic incentiveto improve plant utility.andP;  Automation in general and expert systems inparticular do this by helping to prevent costly, unscheduled shutdowns due toequipment failure.andP;  Expert systems can also improve the percentage of timethe process produces top-grade products by interpreting errant processbehavior and advising corrective action.andP;  Companies understand that much oftheir competitive advantage results from knowledge about how to operate theprocess and process equipment most effectively.andP;  Because human expertise isperishable, interest in capturing this knowledge in expert systems isgrowing.andM;Much of the motivation for building online expert systems in the processindustry is consistent with the published benefits for knowledge-basedsystems in general; that is, expertise is scarce, vague, and dispersed andshould be preserved, made precise, focused, and applied continuously.andP;  Also,once captured, knowledge can be distributed among similar applications.andO;Another motivating factor for applying on-line expert systems is reducingplant staffing.andP;  However, this is not a primary justification since operatinglabor typically represents a very small percentage of the total productioncost.andP;  But reducing the routine technical assistance to manufacturingrequired of process engineers is of great interest.andP;  If expertiese isleveraged in expert systems, enginers could move to more productive,creative, and valuable tasks.andP;  Domestic companies are also motivated by thefact that the Japanese are moving aggressively into the application ofon-line expert systems.andP;  [2]andM;PROCESS CONTROLandM;Improvements in process-control technology have been evolutionary.andP;  Beforethe 1940s, process parameters--flows, temperaturs, and pressures--werecontrolled by human operators who adjusted valves manually while watchinglocal instrument indicators, such as sight glasses and pressure gauges.andP;  Inthe 1940s and 1950s, pneumatic instrumentation was developed for sensingprocess parameters and providing feedback control.andP;  This gave operatorshands-off control and allowed signal transmission to a remote control room,thus improving operator safety and comfort.andP;  With the advent of thetransistor in the 1960s, analog electronic instrumentation became availableon the market.andP;  Electronic instrumentation became more table and precise thanits pneumatic counterparts, and signals could be transmitted instantaneouslyover long distances.andP;  This allowed control areas to consolidate further,requiring less labor to operate the plant.andM;Beginning in the 1960s, digital computers were applied for process control.andO;Computer inputs from process-measurement instrumentation and computer outputsignals t control valves were directly connected to the computer, providingdirect digital control.andP;  Most process industries rejected this techniquebecause having many control variables concentrated in a single computer wasrisky.andP;  This concern was alleviated in the 1970s when microprocessortechnology allowed acceptable distribution of computing, control activity,and cost-effective redundancy, where required.andP;  Microprocessor-based,programmable logic controllers replaced discrete relays and other electroniclogic systems for performing safety/process interlocks and sequencingoperations for batch control.andP;  Distributed control systems consisting ofCRT-based consoles and microprocessor-based controllers replaced panel boardsof individual analog feedback controllers.andM;Today, digital-control systems dominate the industry.andP;  On larger processes,these systems typically feed data to a higher-level host computer for dataarchival, further data manipulation, and more sophisticated controlmanipulation.andP;  Sophisticated control strategies--linear and nonlinearoptimizations, times-series analysis, control strategies based on processmodels, and statistical process-control techniques--reside at this level.andO;These ohst computer systems are usually networked in a hierarchy of technicaland business computing systems to make process information available to theappropriate technical and managerial personnel.andP;  Thus, many processes containthe necessary information networks to permit on-line, expert-systemapplications.andM;Even so, expert-system technology's entrance into process-controlapplications has been gradual and continues to evolve slowly.andP;  On the whole,this industry is rather conservative when it comes to using novel technology.andO;Any misapplication can have severe consequences in terms of capital equipmentand product loss, human safety, or possible environmental contamination.andO;Despite his operating philosophy, the motivation for applying expert-systemstechnology is too compelling to disregard, and tools and techniques haveevolved until beginning system implementation is cost-effective.andP;  Applicationareas that have benefitted include sensor validation, data reconciliation,on-line equipment diagnosis, and model-based knowledge systems.andP;  We routinelyfind applications with a 10:1 rate of return.andM;In the past, computer-based applications have approached what we callartificial intelligence today.andP;  In many cases, these systems were designedfor one-of-a-kind applications related to a critical process problem.andO;Generally, they take multiple-process sensor inputs, analyze the data, makenonroutine decisions about process operation conditions, and adjust processtarget values.andP;  In most cases, these applications have been written inprocedural computer languages.andM;In one example, a water-cooled process reactor for an exothermic chemicalreaction is operated at maximum cooling to gain the greatestproduct-to-ingredient yield.andP;  Increased cooling promotes a fouling problemthat reduces heat transfer from the process fluid to the cooling water andeventually causes a severe loss of cooling and subsequent shutdown (with thepotential for a runaway reaction).andP;  A supervisory computer monitors thedifferential temperatures of the process fluid and the cooling watter tocalculate a heat-transfer coefficient.andP;  When the supervisory computerdetermines that heat transfer is inadequate, it ramps the process temperatureupward until the fouling clears and then gradually ramps the temperature backdown to approach optimum yield once again.andP;  This system definitely embodiesprocess expertise, though not designed as an expet system.andM;In the case of this computer program, the sensor data exists and changesfairly slowly with time; that is, the heat-transfer coeficient will changeover tens of minutes.andP;  Such long time constants are typical for manypetrochemical processes.andP;  However, much smaler time constants, on the orderof tens of milliseconds, are involved in diagnosing electromechanicalinterlock systems.andP;  In one case, phantom shutdown of a $3 million, 20,000horse-power compressor result in down time costing $15,000 per hour.andO;Capturing and quickly analyzing data for one of 40 possible interlockconditions capable of shutting down the compressor is absolutely necessary.andO;A high-speed event recorder has been developed to log data such as vibration,stator temperature, over-voltage or over-current conditions, and high processtemperature or pressure every millisecond.andM;This data collection rate is required to obtain sufficient resolution sincethe drop-out time for the interlock relays is about 20 milliseconds.andP;  Afteran interlock event, experts determine the trip's cause.andP;  In this case dataanalysis has not been reduced to an expert system, although such an operationis possible.andP;  The key to this application is having the available data withsufficient resolution to diagnose the problem.andP;  In this example, respondingwith any kind of correcive action during the tripping process is impossible;however, by aiding the postmortem analysis, the system reduces the mean timeto repair, thereby increasing compressor availability.andM;In terms of process dynamics, we find some extremely long time constants inchemical processes with large residence times.andP;  These time constants can beseveral hours, meaning the process response to adjustments made by oneoperator may not be fully developed until hours later or perhaps until thenext operating shift has taken over.andP;  (The new operator may not be aware ofthe previous action.)andP;  In these caess, great expertise and patience arerequired to control the process.andP;  The long time constants and large inertialloads of these processes make operating them much like navigating asupertanker: any need for corrective action mus be anticipated and patienceis required to allow process response to develop.andP;  Because these are notnatural human tendencies, automatic process control and expert systems canbenefit the operation of these processes.andM;These examples emphasize a point regarding real-time process-control systems,including expert systems: real time depends completely on the time constantsof the process.andP;  A real-time system must collect and analyze data and issue aresponse within a time acceptable for resolving a problem.andM;AI APPLICATIONSandM;Du Pont has explored many appplication areas: sensor validation, datareconciliation, process and equipment diagnosis, and model-based expertsystems.andP;  Individual measurements generated by on-line process sensors arefundamental to on-line expert systems.andP;  These sensors range from basicphysical measurement device such as thermocouples to extremely complexdevices such as on-stream process analyzes (complex chemical or electricalprocesses).andP;  The sensor's charcteristic behavior reflects its design,specific installation, and process behavior.andP;  Many sensors are critical toprocess operation because they supply feedback and closed-loop control.andP;  Intypical wet-chemical processes, about one-third of all process measurementsserve as interlock sensors or are used in closed-loop control systems.andP;  Thesesystems operate on the principle that the incoming measurement signalaccurately reflects the process condition.andP;  Typically, these control systemsonly recognize a sensor fault for extreme conditions (open circuit, shortcircuit, and so on).andM;The objective of using expert systems for sensor validation is to improve themeasurement system's overall reliability.andP;  This may simply mean recognizingthat the sensor is suspect and an alternate measurement or control strategyshould be instituted.andP;  A further objective is to improve the overallavailability of the process measurement by providing troubleshootingassistance to the maintenance technician, thus reducing the mean time torepair.andP;  In general, systems that perform sensor validation can be used inmultiple applications, generating more compelling economic incentives fortheir development.andM;Process engineers and plant operators develop experience in distinguishingnormal from abnromal behavior of specific sensors.andP;  As an elementary example,consider the reactor temperature (Figure 1).andP;  Due to the large thermalinertia of the process, this signal is not expected to make an abrupt shiftin valued but will exhibit smooth, highly damped behavior.andP;  Therefore, anysudden shifts indicate a faulty signal (probably an electronic failure).andM;Other common physical-process measurements are pressure and flow detection.andO;These signals exhibit a certain level of high frequency noise, as shown inFigure 2.andP;  A change in the noise band such as an increase or decrease in thenoise level may indicate a faulty signal.andP;  A typical low noise level mayindicate that the sensor has become detached from the process; for example,by a closed block valve.andP;  While the average pressure remains unchanged, thenoise level will drop to zero.andP;  An increase in noise may indicate instabilityin the measurement.andP;  Engineers and operators recognize the typical signalpatterns on strip-chart recorders or equivalent CRT displays.andP;  This processhas been automated by developing algorithms to detect suspicious sensorbehavior.andP;  With a short-term history of process data, these algorithmscompute the rate of change, moving average and standard deviation, and othervariables.andM;Du Pont also has an expert system that performs sensor validation on complexprocess analyzers.andP;  This system diagnoses mechanical and electronic failuresin the analyzer, abnormal sample presentation to the analzyer, and adverseambient conditions relative to the process or analyzer.andP;  The expert system issegmented into a monitoring component that continuously scans and processeson-line data and a rule-base component that analyzes a snapshot ofinformation and manually entered data.andP;  The expert system monitors on-linedata for suspicious behavior, including the signal stability of themeasurement and reference signal, and the characteristics of internalsignals, such as the automatic gain control.andM;If the expert system determines that a fault has occurred, it alerts theoperator.andP;  The maintenance technician can then activate the diagnostic expertsystem, which reads a snapshot of information from the on-line scanner,processes the data, and collects the additional information necessary todiagnose the problem from the technician.andP;  As in most other applications,human observation enhances no-line data.andP;  In most cases, a complete data setdoes not exist on line because some measurements or observations cannot beperformed on line cost-effectively.andM;In a well-instrumented chemical process, redundant process data existsbecause of the process's inherent physical interaction.andP;  Consider the processby which inflow, outflow, and tank level are measured (Figure 3).andP;  Thesemeasurements are related by the mass-balance equation, which states that anydifference between in-flow and out-flow results in a level change; the rateof level change is proportional to the difference in the two flows.andM;Any of the three measured variables could be calculated from the other twousing the mass-balance equation; hwever, all three are usually measured.andO;This creates redundant data, allowing cross-checks on all signals.andP;  Knowledgein the form of these governing equations is deep and provides additionalinformation about the health of individual sensors and the process ingeneral.andM;Drift in individual sensors may occur over a long period.andP;  Althoug it maynotbe detectable by sensor-validation techniques, it can often be detected bydata-reconciliation techniques.andP;  Much work has been done in this area usingboth traditional data-reconciliation techniques [3] and expert-systemmethodology.andP;  In both aproaches, noisy, imprecise measurements impede datareconciliation; however, sensor repeatability may be sufficient to allow datareconciliation even though sensor precision may be poor.andP;  [4]  Relationshipsother than mass-balance relationship, such as energy-balance andreaction-rate equations, can reconcile process data.andP;  In addition,data-reconciliation techniques can be applied to process measurements andcontrol-system outputs associated by feedback control.andP;  Sincefeedback-controller outputs often control variables such as pump speed or theautomatic valve position, they provide a crude indication of process flow.andM;The reconciliation scheme can also include laboratory data.andP;  Since layanalysis is considered the ultimate proof that product properties meetspecifications, lab data are of major importance.andP;  In addition, laboratorymethods are sometimes required because techniques for on-line measurement ofspecific product composition may not be practical.andP;  In reconciling laboratorydata with on-line process data, care must be taken that the data is adjustedin time.andP;  Because it may take several hours for the sample to be taken andprocessed in the lab and results returned, the lab data must be compared tothe corresponding historical data taken on-line.andP;  Laboratory data can providethe final validation of on-line sensors and process operation.andM;Sensor validation and data-reconciliation techniques allow processmeasurements to be validated wherever measurement methods may fail or driftfrom the necessary accuracy.andP;  If measurement data are considered highlyreliable, these steps may not be necessary.andP;  In any case, once process datahave been judged reliable, individual data values may be cobmined intopatterns, providing a higher information level.andP;  As a simple example,consider a liquid-flow process that normally operates under pressure.andP;  If theprocess flow increases and the pressure decreases rapidly, the processequipment or piping may have ruptured.andM;In another example, an exothermic batch reactor may be charged withingredients and catalysts and then heated with steam to initiate thereaction.andP;  As the reaction begins, the process temperature increases rapidly.andO;The expert system monitoring this process watches for the characteristictemperature profile when activation conditions have been met (the ingredientshave been charged and the steam has been on long enough).andP;  Insufficienttemperature rise indicates that not enough catalyst has been charged or thatthe catalyst's activity level is too low to initiate the reaction.andP;  Thesepattern-matching techniques are implemented in production-rule-based expertsystems.andM;In addition to sensor data, these process-diagnostic applications oftenrequire observation by a human operator.andP;  This applies less to highlyautomated wet-chemical processes and more to sparsely insrumented mechanicaloperations, such as paper-manufacturing processes and film- or sheet-dryingoperations.andP;  In film- or sheet-processing applications, about 50% of theinformation required for a process diagnostic system must be enteredmanually.andP;  Expert systems for these applications must have a well-designedoperator interface.andP;  Applications in the utility [5] and paper manufacturingindustries [6] use manually entered data.andM;In addition to diagnosing process malfunctions that affect product quality,diagnosing supporting equpiment, such as refrigeration machines, boilers,compressors, and instrumentation systems, is frequently desirable.andP;  Theanalzyer diagnostic system previously described is also an example of anequipment diagnostic application.andP;  Another example of this type of expertsystem is a diagnostic package for refrigeration equipment, which usespressure and temperature data from both the process and refrigerant sides ofthe machine to detect degrading performance.andP;  Problems may occur in thecompressor, condenser, evaporator, or purge unit and consists of abnormalconditions, such as compressor surging, loss of heat transfer, lubricatingoil problems, and bearing failure.andP;  The system is being prototyped in anoff-line system.andP;  Both of these examples represent systems that can beapplied in many similar (though not all identical) appplications because thesupporting equipment is common to many processes and plants.andM;Model-based expert systems involve deep knowledge about the process.andP;  Modelsare derived from first-principle relationships of physics and chemicalengineering and from empirical models based on statistical regression ofprocess data.andP;  Incorporating this type of deep knowledge into an expertsystem allows for a very compact, precise system design.andP;  This has beenproven true in diagnosing electronic circuits [7] and detecting chemicalplant faults.andP;  [4]  On-line models have been used for process-controlstrategies relying on the model to make process measurements unattainable online with physical methds.andP;  Product properties or chemical compositions maybe computed indirectly using available sensors to supply data for the model.andM;A simple example is using a model to calculate polymer viscosity frompressure, temperature, and flow measurements on a transfer pipeline.andP;  Thebiotechnology industry applies models to determine cell growth in bioreactorsfrom the measurements of bulk properties, such as oxygen feed, ammoniaevolution in the off-gas, and biomass temperature.andP;  Du Pont has developedexpert systems that interact with process models and use the model-generatedresults as input information to the inference engine.andP;  On-line dynamic modelscan reason about the projection of process variables into the future.andP;  ModernAI tools allow model parameters to be included as object attributes (in anobject-oriented tool).andP;  Combining the power of object-oriented modeling withan object-oriented expert system can be very powerful yet easy to understandand maintain.andM;KNOWLEDGE-BASE DEVELOPMENTandM;Much has been written about knowledge extraction and knowledge-basedevelopment.andP;  Du Pont's experience has not been unique in these areas.andP;  Wehave found the accuracy and validity of the resulting expert systems tocorrelate directly with the quality of the domain expert's knowledge andability to communicate this knowledge.andP;  Applying expert system technologydemands the same understanding of the industrial process required whenapplying conventional control strategy and modeling techniques.andP;  In manycases, knowledge extraction has elucidated valuable information and producednew insights into the expert's reasoning.andP;  Therefore, performing initialproblem analysis can be valuable even before the expert system isconstructed.andP;  Du Pont has succeeded in staffing these projects by providingAI education to engineers experienced in process control.andP;  Using so-calledknowledge engineers unfamiliar with this domain has proven impractical.andP;  Inprocess-control AI application, domain experience outweighs AI experience.andO;Other companies have come to similar conclusion.andP;  [8]andM;In many applications, existing domain expertise is adequate.andP;  It may exist inmany forms: heuristics and empirical understanding from operating experience,fundamental understanding of first principles, existing models, and so forth.andO;In our applications, most knowledge comes from engineers who have practicalexperience with the process or technical specialists who have studied it froma fundamental point of view.andP;  Senior operator's experience has also beenincluded in some applications.andM;For applications in which cause-and-effect relationships are vague, we haverun statistically designed experiments or less formal step tests to obtainbetter knowledge of these relationships and map cause and effect.andP;  Thoughthese techniquees are not novel AI technology, they clarity knowledge anotherway.andM;Du Pont has applied various tools and knowledge-representation techniques,including induction and rule-based, object-oriented, and frame-based systems.andO;We have found that object-oriented knowledge powerfully represents thephysical entities (such as sensors, pumps, valves, and pipes) and conceptualentities (such as mass and energy balances).andP;  The object structure affordsmuch more efficient development of lrage applications.andP;  Logic has generallybeen represented in the form of production rules; however, we have seen theneed for other pattern-matching techniques such as truth tables.andM;Du Pont has employed straightforward inferencing techniques for on-lineexpert systems.andP;  These systems are usually data-drivenf they use forwardchaining but employ some backward chaining for gathering data with respect tospecific goals.andP;  Using tools that allow the knowledge base to be partitionedinto compact modules that can be activated at the appropriate time has beenvery advantageous.andP;  Our expert systems run in several modes.andP;  Some systemsrun in a continuously scanning mode, monitoring for certain events to occur.andO;Others are executed by periodic scanning when fresh data is available,usually once a minute (but perhaps more often).andP;  Some are activated byexternal events such as the input of lab data, while others are activatedmanually as needed.andP;  The inference engine must be able to continue processingreal-time data while it seeks manually entered dataf the system must notfreeze under any conditions.andM;Several approaches to system validation have proven acceptable.andP;  For simplesystems designed to detect process phenomena, some applications have beenbuilt simply and put on line.andP;  The performance of these systems is monitoredas the particular process condition recurs.andP;  In most cases, however,capturing data related to process phenomena is desirable so the system can betested off line.andP;  The sets provide case studies for alterations andrefinements to the knowledge base.andP;  These data sets may be derived fromarchived plant data or captured during designed experiments.andP;  Validation of asystem around very rare events, such as detection of catastrophic failure,requires process simulation as they only source of test data.andM;To validate the Falcon fault detection system, we used a benchmark data setof 11 sets of actual process data and 10 sets of simulated data.andP;  [4]  Manyinteractions existed in this knowledge base and subtle changes werethoroughly tested using the benchmar data set.andP;  In general, we prefer testingthe system in fast-forward mode (that is, faster than real time) to speed upthe validation process.andM;HUMAN-MACHINE INTERFACEandM;The idea human-machine interface for plant operators would integrate directlywith any existing control console.andP;  To date, this has not been achievablebecause control system vendors have not yet offered expert-system tools orcapability.andP;  Many Du Pont process-control systems also includecompany-proprietary, host computer systems with additional consoles thatdisplay information generated by expert systems.andP;  Several plants use DigitalEquipment Corp. (DEC) workstations (VAXstations) as expert-system operatorinterfaces.andM;Operators desire a very intuitive interface with basic functionality.andO;Whereas system developers may function efficiently using a graphic interfacewith multiple overlaying windows, operators prefer an interface with hardboundaries and simple pushbuttons to call up other information on the screen.andO;Display areas on the screen include scrollable, time-tagged, text-alarmmessages; areas that will call up trend recordings, enter comments, andindicate the value of critical process variables; and facilities foractivating these features.andP;  In addition, the engineers and productionsupervisors can call up an area of logged messages, including alarms andoperator comments.andP;  In some instances, process graphics are also useful;however, these may appear on other control consoles and may not be duplicatedin the expert system.andM;Since Du Pont regards the operators as the customer for these expert systems,we request assistance from operators when designing the human-machineinterface for an application.andP;  Including operator suggestions in the designresults in a more acceptable product and generates ownership by usercontribution, which facilities the technology transfer process.andM;The expert system explain its reasoning and conclusions.andP;  This explanationcapability enhances the credibility of the expert system and is very valuableto operators.andP;  The value of explanation facilities has been recognized by theRESCU developers in the U.K.andP;  [9]andM;On-line, real-time system applications provide a genuine challenge forsoftware designers building expert-system tools.andP;  Capabilities essential tothese applications include data scanning over networks, temporal reasoning(collectuing and anlzying ttime-varying data), calculation, logic solving inrule form, and other pattern-macthing facilities.andP;  To handle time-varyingdata, the tool should have an internal historian for buffering data used toestablish trends, rates of change, and other signal characteristics (likenoise level).andP;  A library of common signal-processing functions is alsouseful.andP;  Highly desirable characteristics include an object-orientedstructure allowing for multiple levels of classes, subclasses, and instances.andO;Class (generic) rules are essential for efficiency when reasoning aboutcommon objects in the process; for example, a single rule should be able tocheck all temperature sensors against a high limit.andM;Though text editors may be a plausible development environment for smallapplications, graphic editors are decidedly more efficient and desirable.andO;The editor should make as many syntactic and semantic checks as possible andprovide on-line assistance for developing the proper rule grammar.andO;Validation capability using canned data files and run-time debuggingfacilities such as break points, watch points, and single-step mode should beincluded.andP;  Facilities for constructing an operator interface as previouslydescribed are necessary; this interface should allow operator data entry.andM;Because these applications are critical, the on-line system and its tool mustinclude facilities for error handling when communication errors occurs, datasupply systems go down, or bad data is returned from the process.andP;  Becausethese events are inevitable, the tool and application must be designed tocope with them, adding yet another levelof complexity to the on-lineapplication.andM;For more complex applications, Du Pont uses the commercial tool G2 fromGensym Corp. G2 offers most of the required functionality and runs on manyplatforms, including standard DEC WAX computer hardware platforms thatprevail in our plants.andP;  Du Pont and Gensym have formed a working partnershipto provide enhanced solutions to real-time AI applications.andP;  For smallerapplications, we apply hybrid approaches by processing temporal data in anexternal program and calling an off-line tool such as Level5.andM;VISION OF THE FUTUREandM;Du Pont applies a broad range of on-line expert systems.andP;  These initialsuccesses create more interests and generate additional applications;therefore, we predict AI will become widespread in the company and theprocess industries in the future.andP;  Though we view AI and expert systems asextensions to conventional automation and process-control technology, newtools and improved application skills will allow further improvement in therate of accomplishment.andM;This article reflect the experience and efforts of J.T.andP;  Cardinal, R.K.andP;  Cox,K.A.andP;  Kosanovich, R.R.andP;  Lott, S.R.andP;  McBride, L.I.andP;  Morganstein, S.
