Baker III to abandon the Bush administration'shopes for a moderate leadership in Iran and recognize insteadIranian resistance groups seeking to topple the government.   In a letter initiated by Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., thelawmakers also called on the administration to work with its alliesand impose an arms and oil boycott against Iran.   President Bush has taken a conciliatory tone toward the newgovernment that took power in Iran following the death earlier thisyear of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Bush has sent messages to newlyelected President Hashemi Rafsanjani saying Iran could end itsinternational isolation by releasing the eight Americans heldhostage by Iranian-backed militants in Lebanon.   But the congressional letter, signed by 121 Democrats and 65Republicans, warned the administration against ``continuing tospeculate and hope for the miraculous emergence of moderates fromwithin the present ruling clique.''   It said ``those who have been identified as moderates, including... Rafsanjani ... have continued the repressive policies ofKhomeini.''   The lawmakers said it remains the responsibility of the Iranianpeople, including the opposition group People's Mujahedeen of Iran,to ``bring about change and a new order in Iran.''</TEXT></DOC>
