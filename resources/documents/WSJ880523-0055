Emshwiller </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> C CBS </CO><IN> AUT TEL </IN><TEXT>   Jeep's defenders have spent more than seven years attacking what may be their most well-known foe: a television show.    In December 1980, a segment of CBS Inc.'s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; alleged that American Motors Corp.'s Jeep CJ-5 rolled over too easily. The weekly investigative news show aired film of tests in which Jeeps did roll over with apparent ease.    Officials then with American Motors say the show had enormous impact. In the year prior to the broadcast, about 50 rollover suits had been filed against the company; the following year there were 200. &quot;We peg history as before '60 Minutes' and after '60 Minutes,'&quot; says Kenneth Gluckman, a lawyer working on the rollover issue for Chrysler Corp., which purchased American Motors last year.    It was a &quot;made-for-TV hatchet job,&quot; adds Don Stansberry Jr., another Chrysler attorney. Chrysler officials contend that neither the vehicles tested nor the tests themselves mirrored real-world conditions. (CBS, for its part, stands behind the accuracy of the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment and believes the tests shown were valid, according to a network spokesman.)    Chrysler's biggest gripe is with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. This group, funded by property and casualty insurers, commissioned and paid for the rollover tests shown on &quot;60 Minutes.&quot;    The company points to internal institute memos about the tests. One instructs the testing company to continue doing a certain maneuver until &quot;you can reliably reproduce . . . the desired rollovers.&quot; Another discusses various things that might need to be done to &quot;insure rollover.&quot;    Chrysler claims the tests included certain types of turning maneuvers that produce tire-edge wear capable of increasing road-gripping ability by up to 40%, and says this may have been a factor in the results. The greater the tire grip, Chrysler notes, the greater the chance a vehicle will roll over instead of skid in a hard turn.    Another gripe concerns the way the turning maneuvers were executed. For safety's sake, the Jeeps in the tests were driven by automatic control devices. In six of the eight rollovers, the steering wheel was turned at rates of more than 1,000 degrees (the equivalent of almost three complete revolutions) per second. Though possible, that is far faster than people would generally steer, even in an emergency, Chrysler contends.    Company officials argue, too, that the maneuvers used could have caused any number of other vehicles -- including standard passenger cars -- to roll over. Since the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; episode, the company has commissioned its own tests in which other vehicles have indeed tipped over in similar maneuvers.    On the show, Brian O'Neill, president of the insurance institute, told how the federal government had such safety concerns about the Jeep that it barred the sale of used military Jeeps to the public. Chrysler officials point out that the banned Jeep had major design differences from the CJ series, and that the military version of the CJ was never banned for resale.    Mr. O'Neill says he knew about the differences, but he denies his comments were misleading. He says he believes the banned Jeep version had enough similarities to the CJ to warrant the mention.    He also concedes that some of the steering maneuvers in the CJ tests were &quot;rapid,&quot; but adds that they were &quot;within the ability of human beings.&quot;    As for the tires, John Noettl, who was the lead engineer in the testing project, says they were checked regularly to make sure there wasn't excessive wear. The tires &quot;had nothing to do with the Jeep's rollover problem,&quot; he asserts.    Chrysler is merely nitpicking, Mr. O'Neill argues. He readily acknowledges that the institute was trying to roll over the Jeeps but says it was doing so only by using maneuvers that occur in actual driving. He says the CJ-5 was picked because statistics -- which Chrysler challenges -- showed it to have the worst rollover record of any vehicle.    However, Mr. O'Neill agrees that other utility vehicles might have had rollovers if tested, though perhaps not at such low speeds. The institute thought of testing another make as well but dropped the idea because of cost and logistics. If testing of more than just the Jeep had gone ahead, Mr. O'Neill says, the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; piece &quot;might have been a different story.&quot;    (See related story -- &quot;Rollover Worry Plagues Utility Vehicles --- Memos Outline Safety Concerns Of Jeep's Maker&quot; -- WSJ May 23, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
