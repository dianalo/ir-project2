The regulation establishes requirements for the finaluse and disposal of sewage sludge when it is applied to the land, distributedand marketed, placed in monofills (sludge-only landfills) or on surfacedisposal sites, or incinerated. The standards for each end use and disposalmethod consist of either limits on the pollutant concentrations in sewagesludge or equations for calculating these pollutant limits; managementpractices; and other requirements that prescribe the level of managementcontrol that treatment works, users, and disposers must exercise over sewagesludge. EPA also proposed monitoring, record keeping, and reporting requirements.These standards apply to publicly and privately owned treatment works thatgenerate or treat domestic sewage sludge, as well as to any person whouses or disposes of sewage sludge from such treatment works. Consistentwith the statute, the proposed rule requires compliance within 12 monthsof the date the rule is promulgated, or within 24 months if the regulationsrequire construction of new pollution control facilities. Qualified publiclyowned treatment works (POTWs) that comply with the requirements in 40 CFRPart 403 may be eligible to revise categorical pretreatment standards applicableto industrial users in order to allow additional discharges into POTWsof the pollutants included in this rule. The proposed standards do not apply to sewage sludge treatment processesthat precede final use or disposal or to domestic sewage that is treatedalong with industrial waste and wastewater by privately owned industrialfacilities. In addition, standards are not established in this part forsewage sludge that is determined to be hazardous using the procedures in40 CFR Part 261, Appendix II, or to sewage sludge found to contain greaterthan 50 parts per million (ppm) of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Requirementsin 40 CFR Parts 261-268 apply to sewage sludge determined to be hazardous,and requirements in 40 CFR Part 761 apply to sewage sludge containing greaterthan 50 ppm of PCBs. Compliance with these requirements will constitutecompliance with section 405 of the CWA. Included in the rule are conformingamendments to 40 CFR Part 257. The conforming amendments remove the applicabilityof Part 257 for sewage sludge disposed of by those practices for whichEPA is proposing standards under Part 503. Because of the innovative and precedential risk-based approaches used indeveloping the proposal, EPA has solicited public comments on a broad rangeof issues and requested specific data and information to support finalpromulgation. To allow the public ample time to respond, EPA will acceptpublic comments on the proposed rule until August 7, 1989 (180-days). Inaddition, EPA will hold four 1-day public hearings to receive oral andwritten comments on the proposal, and will conduct two 2-day workshopsto discuss the technical bases of the regulation. Today, EPA is announcing the locations and schedules for the public hearingsand workshops on the proposed rule. The hearing registration will be at 8:00 am with the hearings beginningat 9:00 am and running until 5:30 pm. The hearings may be adjourned earlierif there are no remaining comments. Those who want to make a statementat the hearings should notify, in writing, Kate Schalk, Sludge Hotline,6 Whittemore Street, Arlington, MA 02174. Such requests should be received15 days in advance of each hearing. Those wishing to make oral presentationsmust restrict them to 15 minutes and are encouraged to have written copiesof their complete comments for inclusion in the official record. If timeallows, those who have not pre-registered will be allowed to make presentationsafter pre-registered speakers. To better inform the public, EPA will also conduct two 2-day workshopsprior to the public hearings to discuss the technical bases of the proposedrule. Pre-registration for the workshops is required due to space limitations.To register, please contact EPA's Sludge Hotline, 6 Whittemore Street,Arlington, MA 02174, Telephone (617) 648-7898/7899. <ITAG tagnum="6">Rebecca Hanmer, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Administrator for Water. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-8419 Filed 4-11-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
