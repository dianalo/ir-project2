At midafternoon Tuesday in New York, when trading roomsshut down for the New Year's Day holiday, the dollar wasquoted at 124.85 yen, down from 125.55 yen late Monday in NewYork. That was well below the lowest previous 1991 late NewYork quote of 127.73 yen, on Feb. 11.</LP><TEXT>   The dollar, which moved little against currencies otherthan the yen, in the slow trading, was quoted at 1.5170marks, down from 1.5193 marks late Monday in New York.Sterling was trading at $1.8690, up from $1.8670.   The dollar's continued decline against the yen, even afterJapan eased monetary policy Monday, is linked to thescheduled visit by President Bush to Tokyo next week. Theleaders of both countries are expected to discuss ways toboost U.S. exports to Japan to reduce that country's mountingtrade surplus.   Strengthening the yen against the dollar, which would makeU.S. goods cheaper for Japanese consumers, is expected to behigh on Mr. Bush's agenda.   After the Bank of Japan lowered its official discount rate-- the rate at which it lends to banks -- to 4.5% from 5%,central bank Governor Yasushi Mieno denied any link betweenthe action and the upcoming talks. But the currency market'sperception is that the easing was aimed at fostering apositive tone for the meetings between Mr. Bush and JapanesePrime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.   Traders forecast little movement against the yen ahead ofthe talks Jan. 7. The dollar could come under pressure oncomments during and after the talks, and could fall as low as123 yen, a trader at Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York predicted.   Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank LeumiTrust Co. in New York, said the U.S. currency could moveslowly toward 120.00 yen, once the talks are over.   Traders are betting that the dollar will move lower stillagainst the yen, and are holding short, or oversold, dollarpositions against the Japanese currency, said one New Yorktrader.   Against the mark, however, traders have covered theirshort dollar positions, the trader added. Concerns overdevelopments in the former Soviet Union, especially overrepercussions resulting from market reforms in the Russianrepublic, are undermining the mark, he said.   The mark, along with other European currencies, also isfeeling pressure from expectations of an economic slowdownafter recent interest-rate increases by the DeutscheBundesbank and other European central banks, traders said.   And while the dollar is still plagued by the weakness ofthe U.S. economy, traders expressed optimism that mostnegative factors for the currency have been discounted,except for its value against the yen.   &quot;Most of the moves against the dollar have been made,&quot;said Joe Sabbagh, chief trader at European American CapitalCorp., although he cited the &quot;still dangling threat&quot; of afurther drop in U.S. interest rates.   He predicted the market will try to establish a base forthe dollar early in 1992, before trading it higher. Thedollar will probably test support at 1.5000 marks and121.00-123.00 yen, Mr. Sabbagh said.   Speculation in sterling, meanwhile, is expected to havebeen reduced by comments of U.K. Chancellor of the ExchequerNorman Lamont, who told the Financial Times that he has ruledout a devaluation of the pound within the Exchange RateMechanism of the European Monetary System.   The newspaper quoted Mr. Lamont as saying, &quot;There will beno realignment.&quot;   Mr. Lamont added in the interview that he plans no specialmeasures to boost the British economy ahead of thegovernment's annual budget this month.   The pound has been vulnerable to speculative selling sincethe increase in German interest rates Dec. 19.   The German move, aimed at heading off an increase ininflation, dashed hopes for a cut in British interest rates.</TEXT></DOC>
