 All modern telco central office switches give a CPC (DisconnectSupervision) signal to the called party's telephone line when the callingparty hangs up.andP;  The momentary open is useful in telling answering machinesand other equipment that hooks up to the telephone line to disconnect andreturn to their idle state.andM;But very few PBX manufacturers spend the few cents necessary per port toimplement this important feature on their analog station ports.andP;  This problemneedlessly extends the hold times of answering machines and voice-mailsystems that are placed behind most PBXS.andM;We had an application where we wanted to place a bunch of announcementsystems behind a PBX.andP;  But the messages on this system sometimes run to anhour or more so CPC was a necessity.andP;  This severely limited our choice ofswitches.andM;2.andP;  I also get upset by PBX (and key system) manufacturers that only send ashort touchtone burst no matter how long one holds down the dialing button.andO;This was fine in the days when all dialing was done to communicate with theCO.andM;But in these days of automated attendants and the like, it is often necessaryto send a long time to interrupt a message in progress.andM;Unfortunately, purchase decisions are often made solely by reading varioussystem proposals.andP;  Problems such as these usually do not surface until afterthe equipment has been bought and installed.andM;from Jim Gottlieb, Info Connections Tokyo, JapanandM;LETTER TO THE EDITORandM;OPEN ARCHITECTURE.andP;  WE NEED ITandM;Dear Mr. Newton,andM;The July, 1990, TELECONNECT really has me thinking about OAI or the lack ofit !andP;  For the last three years, I have been using my 20 years of telecomexperience to help my clients make the most of the investment they have intheir phone systems.andM;I can't tell you how many brick walls I've hit because of a client's need to&quot;slightly&quot; customize their switch! We usually wind up putting LA2 in toreally address their needs.andM;My question to you  .....andP;  what can we do to get the ATandamp;Ts, NTs, Siemens,etc.andP;  to believe that more systems will stay in place and be expanded orenhanced if we can customize? I understand that custom software may be moredifficult for the techs to work on, but isn't there an answer in theexperience of the computer industry?andM;Thanks for a great article.andP;  Let us all know what kind of response you getfrom the manufacturers.andM;Denise MatlowandM;PS: TELECONNECT is the first publication I recommend when I am training a newtelecom manager!
