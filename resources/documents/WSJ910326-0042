Neither does theCommodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures markets'main regulator.   That may change in the next several months if legislationpending in Congress is approved. But for the moment, &quot;Thereare no insider trading provisions in the Commodity ExchangeAct,&quot; John Mielke, the CFTC's director of marketsurveillance, said yesterday. And the agency isn't eager toget them.   The CFTC said yesterday it is looking into the surge incoffee trading last week before Brazil's announcement that ithad halted coffee exports and was considering returning to aninternational price support system. The announcement rockedcoffee markets world-wide on Friday.   Why isn't insider trading illegal in the futures markets,which have been rocked by scandal on Chicago and New Yorkexchanges?   Insider trading, in fact, is part of the grease that makesthe futures markets run. Companies actively use the futuresmarkets to &quot;hedge&quot; against price changes of commodities theysell or use, whether it's oil, gold or coffee. Suchstrategies are often based on proprietary information about acompany's production or buying plans that could bemarket-moving if it were publicly known.   &quot;The economic justification of the futures market lies toa great extent in its hedging function,&quot; said Thomas Russo, asecurities and commodities lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham andamp;Taft. &quot;And hedging, often by definition, means trading on thefutures market when you have knowledge that nobody else has,&quot;he said.   &quot;Now it doesn't mean that it's right or wrong; that's justthe way of doing business&quot; in commodity markets, Mr. Russosaid.   For example, a platinum mine that plans to shut downproduction and needs to cover its delivery obligations canlegally trade in the futures market before publiclyannouncing its intentions, said Robert T. Davis, a seniorvice president at the New York Mercantile Exchange, whereplatinum futures are traded.   &quot;The analogies to securities laws aren't thatstraightforward,&quot; added Kenneth Raisler, a partner at Rogersandamp; Wells and a former CFTC general counsel. &quot;If I'm going tosell wheat to Russia I'm going to make damn sure I'm long inthe market because I want to make sure I have wheat, if Ineed it, to deliver.&quot;   Commodity experts see no problem with many forms ofinsider trading that could send a company official to jail ifhe traded stocks, rather than futures. &quot;One of the purposesof the futures markets is `price discovery,' and that meansall information is supposed to hit the market,&quot; said StephenSelig, a commodity expert at Baer Marks andamp; Upham, a New Yorklaw firm. &quot;If I happened to find there's going to be a copperstrike, or the Brazilian government is going to put a ban oncoffee exports, at least as far as the market's concerned Ican trade on that information,&quot; he said.   Many insider-trading cases involving commodities might beimpossible to prove anyway, say some commodity lawyers. It'sdifficult in the fast-moving futures markets -- even more sothan in the stock market -- to distinguish between rumor andfact. An inside trader is sure to claim that he didn't act oninside knowledge, just rumors.   This doesn't mean that abusive insider traders in thecommodity markets will never be punished. There are a varietyof prohibitions against insider trading by employees of firmsand members of governments, and a civil or criminal case canbe initiated by a trader's own bosses &quot;alleging corporatetheft or fiduciary violations or what have you,&quot; Mr. Russosaid.   Also, the CFTC can bring civil charges when false ormisleading information is at work. For example, if one ormore of the announcements coming out of Brazil were found tobe fabricated, U.S. regulators could bring amarket-manipulation case, say commodity law experts. However,the CFTC has brought only 10 such cases since its inceptionin 1975, officials said, and none since 1988.   Yesterday, the coffee exchange declined to comment onwhether it was looking into coffee trading last week.However, the CFTC's Mr. Mielke said the exchange iscooperating with the agency's investigation. A member of theexchange said, &quot;A number of us have indicated (to theexchange) that there's something here that may need to belooked into.&quot;   &quot;There are a lot of people who are unhappy because therewas a lot of money that was lost,&quot; the exchange member said.   Coffee for May delivery, which traded as high as $1 apound on Friday before falling, ended at 93.40 centsyesterday, up 0.35 cent, in quiet trading.   CFTC officials argue that they can do a solid job policingthe commodities markets without specific insider-tradinglaws. For example, the agency can monitor large trades in themarkets, allowing it to keep track of which major playershold positions. That could allow them to go after wrongdoerson charges of defrauding customers.   &quot;We do have a lot of tools to use,&quot; said Paul Architzel,chief counsel in the CFTC's division of economic analysis.&quot;The fact that we don't have insider trading laws doesn'tmean the public isn't protected.&quot;   There are prior instances of unusual futures-tradingactivity ahead of government announcements.   Just last month, the Energy Department said it wasreviewing how it notifies winners of bids on oil from U.S.strategic supplies, after complaints that Salomon Inc.'sPhibro Energy unit traded on advanced word about governmentsales of oil. Phibro, which was the biggest winner of bidsfor the government oil, denied it got advance information ortraded on it.   The 1972 sale of wheat and other grains to the SovietUnion -- which sent wheat-futures soaring -- is themost-cited example of suspected insider trading in futuresmarkets. Many investors believed that government employees orofficials of U.S. grain companies were trading for their ownaccounts based on inside information about the three monthsof Soviet-American grain negotiations.   &quot;The record is not clear with respect to insider trading&quot;connected with the wheat sales, a 1984 CFTC report stated.&quot;Apparently, no inquiry was undertaken to ascertain if anygovernment employees or officials of any of the exportingcompanies were trading for their own accounts based on theirknowledge of the cash sales to the U.S.S.R.,&quot; the reportsaid.   Pending legislation would give the CFTC broader authorityto pursue insider-trading cases against futures exchangemembers and officials. Some members of the House ofRepresentatives would like to expand that provision to othersnot directly involved in the markets, but the CFTC isfighting such a move.   &quot;It is possible that making insider trading a felony,without more information on what problems might exist, couldhave an unintended chilling effect on the normal flow ofinformation in the securities markets,&quot; the CFTC said. TheSenate has no provision in its version of the bill to broadeninsider trading penalties beyond exchange members.   In both houses, the pending bill also includes provisionsdesigned to improve cooperation between futures marketofficials in the U.S. and other countries to bolsterinvestigative efforts.   Separately, the coffee exchange said it received approvalfrom the CFTC to trade a new Euro-Differential coffee futurescontract. The contract will be launched April 5, and tradingwill begin with the July 1991 contract.   The contract is based on the price differential betweenEuropean and New York delivery of the coffee futurescontract, reflecting currency and freight rates as well assupply and demand imbalances between these locations, theexchange said. Using the Euro-Differential contract togetherwith the regular coffee contract allows for delivery ofarabica coffee to four European ports.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices fell on therising value of the dollar, which tends to make U.S. grainsmore expensive for foreign buyers. Analysts said a sharpbreak yesterday in the value of the German mark against thedollar is likely to make German buyers of U.S. soybeans lookelsewhere for the grain. In about two weeks, the soybean cropin Brazil -- one of U.S. farmers' major competitors -- willbe ready for shipment. Brazilian farmers will have a built-inadvantage over their counterparts in this country if thedollar's value remains high. The soybean contract for Julydelivery declined 7 1/4 cents a bushel to settle at $5.8125 abushel. In spite of the dollar's activity yesterday, wheatfutures prices rose slightly, up 1 1/2 cents to $2.9350 abushel, on unseasonably dry weather in Kansas and Texas.These states are the heart of the growing region of hard redwinter wheat, and the crop needs rain.                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices declined in very lighttrading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, withsome traders citing the short trading week as reason for theextremely low volume. The exchange is closed Friday for GoodFriday and the beginning of Passover. After trading as low as$19.60 a barrel and as high as $19.97, crude oil for Maydelivery settled at $19.62, down 48 cents a barrel.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell sharply. Gold forApril delivery fell $4.10 an ounce to end at $359.40. Maysilver lost four cents an ounce to finish at $3.953. Aprilplatinum ended $2.50 an ounce lower at $394. Analystsattributed the drop in gold prices to Mideast selling andexpectations that the Soviet Union will step up gold sales.Kuwaiti interests were said to have sold gold to buy dollarsneeded to pay for its reconstruction, said Bernard Savaiko,senior metals analyst at PaineWebber. In addition, talk thatthe Soviet Union had canceled grain shipments fed speculationthat it was having difficulty meeting its debt obligationsand would need to sell gold more aggressively, said Mr.Savaiko. The strong dollar also hurt gold, in part because itshowed again that, amid the turmoil in Europe and the SovietUnion, investors flee to the dollar, rather than gold, as ahaven, said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist atMerrill Lynch. Separately, the Commodity Exchange in New Yorkbegan its three-minute, post-settlement trading session inall of its markets yesterday. The session begins immediatelyafter settlement prices have been announced to the ring, andallows trading only at the settlement prices.</TEXT></DOC>
