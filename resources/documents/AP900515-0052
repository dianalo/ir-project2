A study released Monday in the May 15 issue of the Annals ofInternal Medicine said people who took AZT were more than twice aslikely not to develop AIDS or AIDS-related complex than those whoreceived a placebo.   That study and a similar one last month in the New EnglandJournal of Medicine prompted the federal Food and DrugAdministration in March to allow physicians to prescribe the drugfor patients with the virus who have not developed AIDS symptoms.   ``It means we can recommend intervention to prevent seriousillness just as we would for mild hypertension to prevent stroke orheart disease,'' said Dr. Margaret Fischl, lead author of the studyin the Annals of Internal Medicine.   ``The data shows remarkably that if you give zidovudine (AZT)orally before someone's immune system is severely damaged or theyare severely ill, you will delay development of AIDS,'' she said.   Because AZT is ``licensed for almost all phases of HIVinfection,'' she said, it represented ``a quantum leap in treatmentintervention.''   She said the study also showed ``the drug was well-tolerated,with minimum side effects.'' Only 1 percent of those getting theminimum dose experienced serious side effects, she said.   AZT is the only drug definitively shown to at least slow theusually fatal course of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.   The latest study examined 711 people with mild symptoms of humanimmunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, or HIV, the precursor toAIDS. A placebo was given to 351 people while AZT was given to 360.   Of those getting the drug, 15 developed AIDS or AIDS-relatedcomplex within about 11 months. Of those who did not receive thedrug, 36 developed AIDS or AIDS-related complex.   The results were more conclusive for those with more advancedHIV infection.   The illness is measured by the concentration of CD4 Tlymphocytes, a cell important in forming antibodies. The lower thecount, the more advanced the illness.   Among those whose CD4 T lymphocyte count fell between 200 and500 per square millimeter, 34 subjects who received the placebodeveloped AIDS or AIDS-related complex, compared with 12 whoreceived AZT.   Among those whose CD4 T lymphocyte count fell between 500 and799, two subjects who received the placebo developed AIDS orAIDS-related complex, compared with three who received AZT.   In an editorial, researchers from the University of BritishColumbia cautioned treating patients with counts between 200 and500.   ``The available data do not address the question of whetherearly intervention ... prolongs life or improves its quality,'' theeditorial said.   ``Whereas the selective use of zidovudine in such persons shouldbe endorsed for the present, we eagerly await the results ofongoing trials that will help resolve these important issues,'' theeditorial said.</TEXT></DOC>
