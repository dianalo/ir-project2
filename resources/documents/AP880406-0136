Juan Ramon Matta, 43, was lodged in a cell at Marion, which thefederal prison system uses to house its most dangerous criminals,said Kathryn Morse, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.   Matta was taken by U.S. marshals to Marion early today afterHonduran police arrested him at his home in Tegucigalpa earlyTuesday and put him on a flight headed for the Dominican Republicwithout a passport, U.S. law enforcement sources said, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   He was arrested by U.S. marshals aboard a New York-boundjetliner after being kicked out of the Dominican Republic byofficials who had been informed that he was wanted in the UnitedStates, authorities reported.   In addition to drug charges, the Drug Enforcement Administrationwants to question him about the 1985 murder in Mexico of DEA agentEnrique Camarena Salazar. According to one U.S. law enforcementsource, DEA agents have already interviewed Matta briefly since hisarrival in the United States.   Camarena was kidnapped, tortured and killed in Guadalajara,Mexico, in a slaying allegedly ordered by drug traffickers. John C.Lawn, the head of the DEA, said that Matta was one of the fourprime suspects in the case.   The successful taking into U.S. custody of Matta was the resultof more than a month of sensitive negotiations between Honduran andU.S. officials, a U.S. law enforcement source said today.   Howard Safir, the chief of operations for the Marshals Service,spent the last three to six weeks in Honduras spearheading theeffort to get Matta into the hands of the United States, said thesource, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Honduran government sources said that President Jose Azcona Hoyomet with top civilian and security officials to discuss Matta'scase.   According to other U.S. law enforcement sources, Matta was takeninto custody by Honduran police in the airborne helicopter raid ona warrant signed by a city judge.   Matta's wife, Nancy Vasquez, said that police and the judge hadplaced bag of cocaine on the table in their house and said they hadfound it there. She said there had been no drugs at the residence.   Carlos Lorenzana, Matta's lawyer, said in a telephone interviewthat about 60 heavily armed policemen using helicopters arrived athis client's home at 5:45 a.m. Tuesday.   ``Matta was stunned'' by the raid, said a U.S. law enforcementsource. ``He couldn't believe it.''   Matta had been living openly in Honduras after escaping in 1986from a Colombian prison.   He had been held in Colombia on charges of involvement with theMedellin cartel, the world's largest cocaine-traffickingorganization.   Lorenzana said Matta, as a Honduran citizen, could not beextradited to the United States ``because the constitution forbidsit.''   The Marshals Service said the expulsion from the DominicanRepublic was based on a U.S. warrant for Matta after he escapedfrom Eglin Federal Prison Camp in Florida in 1971. He was serving afive-year sentence for illegally entering the United States andusing a fraudulent visa.   Matta arrived at New York's Kennedy International Airport earlytoday on a flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, said Lt. Kevin Wardof the Port Authority police.   He was accompanied by three federal marshals who put him aboarda government jet.   Warrants charge Matta with escape from federal custody,conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, possession with intent to distributecocaine, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and othercrimes.   ``This arrest is a major milestone in our worldwide assault onillegal drug trafficking,'' Stanley E. Morris, director of the U.S.Marshals Service in Washington, said Tuesday.   The Marshals Service said Matta was believed to have become aleader of a group of traffickers that controlled the flow ofillegal drugs from Mexico.   U.S. authorities link Matta's return to Honduras to an increasein transshipment of Colombian cocaine through the Central Americancountry.   Allegations have been made of involvement by top Honduranmilitary officials.   The government denied the reports in February. Azcona saidcritics were trying ``to discredit the armed forces and mygovernment, which has taken a series of actions to combat the drugtraffickers.''   Matta told The Associated Press in February he makes his livingin cattle ranching, construction and the tobacco, spice and coffeetrade. His wealth has been estimated at up to $2 billion, but heput it at about $5 million.   He said the charges against him were ``a lie, a story,'' andclaimed U.S. agents tried three times in the past year to kidnaphim.   Matta said then he never again would leave Honduras. ``If Iappear in the United States, it is a kidnapping by American agents.If I am killed, it is the DEA,'' he said at the time.</TEXT></DOC>
