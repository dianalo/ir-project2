These properties can be controlledto a certain extent by optimal detector design and fabrication techniques.We describe measurements on the low energy response of Si(Li) detectorsobtained using a tunable monochromatic source. Window thicknesses havebeen measured for a number of devices using different materials for theentry contact. The interpretation of these results in terms of existingdetector window models is discussed. Results obtained using a new contactstructure demonstrate that a dramatic reduction in window-related absorptionin Si(Li) detectors can be achieved.</TEXT></DOC>
