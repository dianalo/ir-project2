(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Residents in this affluent Chicago suburbwill vote Tuesday on a handgun ban less than a year after an8-year-old was killed and six children were wounded in a schoolshooting rampage.   The advisory vote was set because the issue is so emotional in acommunity still scarred by the day last May when Laurie Dann walkedinto a school and began shooting at pupils.   Ms. Dann also wounded a man away from the school and then killedherself.   Some children are drawing posters favoring a handgun ban, whileopponents are saying the ban would be announcing to the world theyare ``sitting ducks.''   The referendum was the idea of ban opponents, who say they wantto prove that most residents oppose giving up their firearms.   Theordore Herst said a handgun ban would send the wrong messagein a metropolitan area with a high crime rate. ``It is a simplisticband-aid solution to a major problem,'' Herst said Wednesday.   ``The firearms in the village are owned by very reliablecitizens, retired military officers, sportsmen,'' Herst said.``This isn't Dodge City, Detroit or Washington.''   Leading the ban effort is George Fisher, whose daughter,Lindsay, was seriously wounded by Ms. Dann. Lindsay Fisher isrecovered and back in school.   ``The carnage ... all over the country will not stop until localcommunities say, `enough is enough,' and apply pressure to theirstate legislators to develop statewide handgun controls, and thestates, in turn, start looking to Congress,'' Fisher said.   Highland Park approved a ban on the possession of handgunsMonday night. Morton Grove, Oak Park, Evanston and Wilmette havesimilar laws.</TEXT></DOC>
