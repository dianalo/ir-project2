The filing with a federal appeals court panel here, which was expected, said a preliminary inquiry uncovered &quot;credible information&quot; that Mr. Nofziger may have repeatedly violated federal ethics laws. The document also provides new information about Mr. Nofziger's activities on behalf of Wedtech Corp., a New York-based defense contractor, and for a unit of Los Angeles-based Early California Industries Inc. after he left the White House in 1982.    The court is expected to go along with the department's recommendations and name an independent counsel soon.    Meanwhile, the Justice Department for the first time officially acknowledged that the investigation of Mr. Nofziger is part of a larger web of criminal probes, including federal grand jury probes in New York and Baltimore, looking into alleged payments by Wedtech and several other companies to politically connected law firms and consultants.    New York state and city prosecutors are cooperating in the investigations, which already have produced indictments and charges of widespread corruption in a number of New York City agencies. Mr. Nofziger hasn't been implicated in the New York City corruption cases.    Mr. Nofziger, a longtime friend and political confidant of Mr. Reagan, in recent weeks has advised White House officials on their handling of the Iran-Contra arms scandal. Such advice came weeks after the first news reports that an independent counsel would be sought.    Through an attorney, Mr. Nofziger said he was pleased by the decision to seek an independent counsel and asserted that a &quot;full, fair and thorough&quot; investigation would show that he didn't violate any laws. Mr. Nofziger's attorneys are expected to argue that his lobbying work didn't have any criminal intent, according to lawyers familiar with the case.    The filing comes at a time when an independent counsel is investigating the lobbying activities of Michael Deaver, another former top aide to Mr. Reagan. Mr. Deaver worked with Mr. Nofziger during Mr. Reagan's first term and later became deputy White House chief of staff before forming his own public relations firm in 1985. Mr. Deaver also has advised the White House recently on handling the Iran-Contra affair.    The Justice Department's filing said that four months after leaving the White House, Mr. Nofziger wrote a letter requesting the help of then-deputy White House counselor James Jenkins in securing a &quot;letter of intent&quot; from the Army for a multimillion-dollar, no-bid engine contract for Welbilt Electronic Die Corp. Such no-bid contracts are commonly available to minority-owned companies. Wedtech last year conceded it wasn't minority-owned.    Welbilt, which later changed its name to Wedtech, eventually received the contract. The Justice Department also told the court that while working at the White House, Mr. Nofziger &quot;may have been involved&quot; in the contract negotiations. Wedtech last month filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.    Federal ethics laws include a one-year ban on former senior government officials contacting their former agencies on any matter with the intent of influencing a decision. In addition, such officials are permanently prohibited from intervening in certain matters they personally handled before leaving the government.    Eleven months after leaving the White House, according to the Justice Department filing, Mr. Nofziger sent a letter asking for the help of William Clark, who was White House national security adviser at the time, to preserve a South Korean rice contract held by an Early California Industries unit. The department said Mr. Nofziger also sent two follow-up memoranda to Mr. Clark in January 1983. The company's Comet Rice unit eventually obtained federal approval to retain the contract.    Attorney General Edwin Meese recused himself from the Nofziger inquiry, so the formal request was made by Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns. </TEXT></DOC>
