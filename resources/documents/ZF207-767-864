Raines, chief of the bureau's Computer Services Division.andM;Local field offices will process about 80 percent of all completedquestionnaires, the ones from suburban areas (called Type II areas) and ruralareas (Type III), said Arnold Jackson, chief of the Decennial OperationsDivision.andM;Jackson said Type I areas, the &quot;hard-to-enumerate&quot; areas such as denselypopulated inner cities, will generate the other 20 percent of the returns.andO;Households will mail these questionnaires directly to one of the sevenprocessing centers, rather than local field offices.andM;He explained that the bureau has had a difficult time recruiting enumeratorsfor Type I areas to investigate why questionnaires were not mailed back.andO;When recruiting proved difficult, census officials decided to use theirlimited human resources on enumeration, not for staffing field offices.andP;  Theregional centers were assigned to process Type I questionnaires.andM;As questionnaires pour into the field offices and processing centers,thousands of census workers will work around the clock with bar code scanninglight wands (in the field offices) and laser scanners (in the processingcenters).andP;  They will scan not the questionnaires but the envelopes.andP;  Thecodes will tell officials which households have returned forms and which needreminders.andM;The address data gathered by light wand in the field offices will be filed ona DEC MicroVAX 3500 minicomputer and is periodically uploaded onto themainframes in the central computer complex in Suitland.andM;Gary Sullivan, systems manager at the Kansas City, Mo., processing center,said each processing center has a DEC cluster composed of two VAX 8530minicomputers and one VAX 8810 (286M of memory per cluster).andP;  A local areanetwork connects the cluster to 11 VAXmate workstations in the processingcenter via a VS200 terminal server.andM;The codes on the Type I envelopes entering the regional processing center arescanned by equipment Census obtained as surplus from the Internal RevenueService more than two decades ago.andP;  Census engineers have modified thescanners so that each reads code on 400 envelopes per minute.andM;That data is stored on the clustered minis at the processing centers andeventually goes to the field offices for editing.andM;After the address data is captured, the questionnaires are opened andphotographed by a Census invention, a highspeed strobe-light camera/pageturner.andP;  Each field office will use 10 of the devices to photographquestionnaires at a rate of 90 pages per minute (for the long form) and 130per minute (for the short form).andP;  Each roll of high-contrast panchromaticfilm accommodates about 3,600 questionnaire pages.andM;After being developed and checked for clarity, the film is sent to one of theprocessing centers where it is processed on a negative image scanner,referred to as FOSDIC, or Film Optical Storage Device for Input to Computers.andO;Census engineer Leighton Greenough invented FOSDIC in 1952.andM;Paul Friday, chief electronics design engineer, said the bureau rebuilds theFOSDICs for each census, incorporating faster and more accurate technology.andO;He said the bureau is busy constructing 21 new FOSDICs this year, at a costof about $100,000 apiece.andM;Each frame of film holds a negative image of one page.andP;  Friday said thescanner searches the image for questionnaire answers, which appear white.andO;The device is capable of 25,000 light meter readings per second, whichtranslates into 1,200 questionnaire pages per minute.andM;Three FOSDICs in each of the processing centers will scan the film.andP;  Linkedto each FOSDIC is a Compaq 386 microcomputer, running at 33 MHz, whichtranslates the scanned data into a form readable by the clusteredminicomputers.andP;  Once in the DEC cluster, it is edited again.andP;  If the datafails any edit stages, questions are resolved and it is re-entered at theFOSDIC.andM;Friday said storing questionnaire data on film instead of paper has severaladvantages.andP;  First, the film record takes less storage space than stackedquestionnaires.andP;  With the high-contrast film, weak response marks show upbrighter in the negative image.andM;If the data passes through the edit stage it is transmitted via a wide areanetwork to Suitland, where it is routed through dedicated point-to-pointEthernet to the mainframes.andM;The four Unisys mainframes will process data during an estimated 90,000 CPUhours.andP;  The systems' processing power totals about 46 million instructionsper second.andM;Census officials restructure the data, apportioning each state with a newcount for its congressional districts.andP;  The secretary of Commerce thenpresents the data to President Bush.andM;But the bureau's work does not end here.andP;  Additional analyses of the datawill continue into the 1990s, generating reports on many facets of Americanlife.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
