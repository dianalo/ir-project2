Grace andamp; Co. in an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit the agency filed against the New York-based chemical company in 1981.    The suit, filed in Middlesex, Mass., Superior Court, alleged that a Grace facility released toxic pollutants that contaminated four of Acton's public wells. A spokesman for the water district said more than $1 million of the settlement money will be used to cover costs for past treatment of Acton's public water supply.    In New York, a spokesman for the company said, &quot;Grace is pleased that the agreement not only settled the dispute equitably but also will have a beneficial effect on Acton's future water supply situation.&quot; The spokesman added that the company didn't admit any liability under the settlement. </TEXT></DOC>
