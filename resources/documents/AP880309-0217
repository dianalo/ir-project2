The officials said troops loyal to the Marxist government killed180 UNITA rebels and captured large quantities of SouthAfrican-supplied equipment in the battle near Cuemba in central Bieprovince.   ``This was a major battle and we expect more fighting in thearea,'' said one of the officials, who spoke on condition ofanonymity. He said the battle ``shows the South African incursioninto Angola is still moving north in conjunction with rebelforces.''   Angolan government radio said government troops destroyed twoSouth African-built armored personnel carriers and captured anotheralong with South African arms and ammunition.   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,also is backed by the United States.   The action was the farthest north UNITA has engaged governmenttroops since it began driving them out of their southeasternstrongholds when South African troops entered the area in Octoberto help the rebels repulse a government offensive.   Cuemba is 375 miles north of Angola's border with SouthAfrican-ruled South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.   In a statement in Lisbon on Wednesday, UNITA said rebels wereenagaged in heavy fighting around Cuemba. It said guerrillas killed11 Angolan soldiers and four Cubans on Monday in an attack on thenearby town of Catabola.   Three weeks earlier, UNITA overran Munhango, 40 miles east ofCuemba.   Both Cuemba and Munhango are along the east-west Benguelarailroad, southern Angola's vital transport link to landlockedZaire and Zambia. UNITA has targeted the railroad during its12-year bush war to press President Jose Eduardo dos Santos'government for a power-sharing accord.   ``Our troops are holding Cuemba,'' the official said.   Angolan Defense Minster Gen. Pedro Maria Tonha said Monday inLubango, capital of the southern province of Huila, that to takethe strategic city of Cuito Cuanavale, South African forcesfighting with UNITA ``have resorted to bombardment of our positionswith long-range artillery because of the failure of their airattacks on the city.''   Angolan authorities announced last month their forces fought offthe third major South African-UNITA offensive against the garrisoncity of Cuito Cuanavale in three months.   Dos Santos said an estimated 7,000 South African troops were inposition around the city, with another 2,000 South African soldiersscattered around south-central Cunene province.   South Africa acknowledged in November it was sending troops intoAngola to aid UNITA and has reported casualties among its forces inAngola in the past two weeks.   In December and January, the U.N. Security Council called for atotal withdrawal of South African forces from Angolan territory.   The Angolan officials confirmed Cuban support troops are inplace in the southern war zone but remain behind Angolan front linepositions. ``They are there if needed,'' one official said.   Cuba has said its has 40,000 troops in Angola and has agreedwith the government to withdraw the Cubans from Angola when SouthAfrica pulls out of the country, stops aiding UNITA and beginsimplementing a U.N. plan for Namibian independence.   South Africa has demanded a Cuban withdrawal first.</TEXT></DOC>
