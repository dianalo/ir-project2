International Data Group Inc. said the venture with Radio iSviaz Publishers was the first joint publishing effort in theSoviet Union.   ``The Soviet government is definitely interested in getting theuse of PCs widespread,'' IDG president Alex Leblois said. ``Whenyou think that a few years ago getting permission to use atypewriter or a copying machine was very difficult, the change isvery great.''   IDG publishes PC World, the second largest U.S. publication onpersonal computers with a monthly circulation of about 475,000.   The first issue of PC World USSR is scheduled to hit Sovietnewsstands at the end of June. A staff of seven Soviet writers andeditors will produce about one-third of the magazine's copy, withthe rest translated from European and the U.S. sources.   The magazine will cost 2 rubles, or about $3.20 at the officialexchange rate, Leblois said.   Eugene N. Salnicov, director of Radio i Sviaz, said some foreignlanguage computer journals are available in Moscow libraries butthat Soviet PC users have no information about developments withinthe country.   Personal computers are in their infancy in the Soviet Union,with under 100,000 Western-made machines used only by a fewuniversities, government officers, scientists and engineers,Salnicov said. But the country has a potential market of 30 millionusers, he added.   ``We feel that from what our experts think the PC enables you toincrease your labor productivity by several hundred percent, sothere's every reason to have them,'' Salnicov said.   About 50,000 copies of the magazine's first issue will beavailable in bookstores and on newsstands, ``which we know will notcome near to satisfying the demand,'' Salnicov said.   Leblois said issues will average 150 pages or more, of whichabout 20 percent will be advertising. Four issues a year areinitially planned.   In keeping with Soviet guidelines on joint ventures adopted inJanuary 1987, the Soviet partner will own 51 percent of the projectand IDG will own 49 percent.   Leblois said IDG has invested $250,000 into the project butexpects to recoup that almost immediately through advertising fromWestern computer makers seeking a foothold in the Soviet Union.   The magazine already has sold ads for its first issue tocompanies including Microsoft, Atari, Ashton-Tate, Bull andSiemens, he said. The first issue should carry $120,000 of ads,Leblois said.   The Soviets did not detail their investment, but in addition tothe seven writers, the magazine will be printed in the Soviet Union.   ``As long as they can hold their investment down there's notmuch to lose,'' Marshall Goldman, associate director of the RussianResearch Center at Harvard University, said of IDG's participation.   ``The question is how long advertisers will be interested, ifthey're selling to a Soviet audience which can't buy what they'reselling.''   But Leblois noted that 16-bit personal computers, which includethe IBM PC and other compatible machines, can be exported to theSoviet Union under relaxed guidelines agreed by Western countriesin January. He predicted that American, Western European andJapanese computer makers will rush to secure joint-productionagreements.   PC World USSR's sales will cover all production costs andadvertising revenues will be paid in Western currencies. That willmake it easier for IDG to repatriate earnings from the project,something which has been a problem for other joint venturesgenerating earnings in rubles.   IDG hich publishes local language editions of PC World in 14nations. It has published China Computerworld, a monthly, since1980 and began a computer magazine in Hungary two years ago, itsonly other publication in the east bloc.</TEXT></DOC>
