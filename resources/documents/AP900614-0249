Analysts viewed the soft increase in the Labor Department'sProducer Price Index for finished goods as encouraging news on theinflation front, especially given last winter's huge price gainscaused by a severe cold snap. That freeze sent wholesale pricesspiraling 1.9 percent in January to a 15-year record.   ``We're back on trend after the wiggles of December andJanuary,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecastingat Georgia State University in Atlanta.   ``The inflationary fears that picked up in the winter monthsclearly did not have a good foundation,'' Ratajczak said.   The report should help dampen inflation worries for the FederalReserve, which has been under pressure to ease itsinflation-fighting campaign and lower interest rates to boost theeconomy, analysts said. Still, most analysts expected no immediateshift in the central bank's policy.   ``The question is how long does the Fed feel it can keep theeconomy subdued? They may say, `Let's keep our nose to thegrindstone on inflation and really see a payoff,''' said RobertDederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.   On Wall Street, investors took the inflation report as adisappointing sign that the Fed would not move anytime soon torelax interest rates. By midday, the Dow Jones average of 30industrials had dropped 12.62, though by day's end it was down just1.48 to 2,928.22.   Many economists were awaiting the government's data on consumerprices for May, due out Friday, for a better picture of thenation's inflation situation.   Consumer prices, up at an annual rate of 6.8 percent for thefirst four months of 1990, have been rising at a steeper pace thanwholesale costs. Producer prices reflect only the cost of goodswhile consumer prices are heavily influenced by the cost ofservices.   For the first five months of the year, overall inflation at thewholesale level was running at a 4.0 percent annual rate, down from4.8 percent for all of 1989, the government said.   Over the past 12 months, wholesale prices have risen a modest3.1 percent.   ``This report shows that we are neither veering into recessionor are we in a situation where inflation is accelerating rapidly,''said Ron Schreibman of the National Association ofWholesaler-Distributors.   In May, energy prices dropped 1 percent after having fallen byeven larger amounts the previous three months. Gasoline prices weredown 2.1 percent and fuel oil fell 6.2 percent. Natural gasincreased 0.9 percent.   Food costs overall were up 0.6 percent after having declined bythat amount the previous two months.   The price of fruit dropped 8.4 percent, vegetables fell 3.9percent and eggs were down 21.8 percent.   But that wasn't enough to offset increases in the price of otherfoods, such as the 7.7 percent hike in the cost of pasta, 4.9percent increase in pork and 8.8 percent rise in the cost of fish.   Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose amild 0.2 percent, the identical increase of a month before.Economists often consider this ``core'' number a better indicatorof underlying inflationary pressures on the economy.   Automobile prices rose 0.3 percent in May after falling theprevious two months.   Women's and children's clothing costs were up while the price ofmen's clothing fell slightly.   The price of tobacco was up 3 percent while the cost ofhousehold flatware, appliances and home electronic equipment fell.   The various changes put the index for all finished goods at117.7 in May. That means a hypothetical selection of goods thatcost $100 in 1982 cost $117.70 last month, up from $114.20 a yearearlier.   Price pressures in earlier stages of the production process weredown in May. Intermediate goods and crude goods both fell 0.1percent. An example of the three processing stages is bread asfinished goods, flour as the intermediate stage and wheat at thecrude level.   The Labor Department revised the data for the first two monthsof 1990, saying wholesale prices rose 1.9 percent in January ratherthan the previously reported 1.8 percent. February prices fell 0.1percent rather than holding steady. Wholesale prices also fellslightly in March and April.</TEXT></DOC>
