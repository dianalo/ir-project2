The National Statistical Office said the country is theworld's 12th largest in trade volume, 10th in car assembly,sixth in electronics production and second in shipbuilding.   At the same time, South Korea, along with China, has theworld's highest per-capita rate of deaths from tuberculosis,the report said. South Korea also has the highest per-capitarate of fatal traffic accidents, and its hospitals andschools are among the most crowded in the world.   The government statisticians said South Korea has yet toimprove the people's living conditions to match the nation'seconomic and industrial growth in recent decades. Thegovernment has recently switched its policy emphasis fromindustrial development to social welfare.   Separately, South Korea agreed with Russia to hire 110Russian scientists in high-technology areas this year, SouthKorea's Yonhap news agency said.                                                                                                          MANILA EXPECTS IMF APPROVAL                                                                                                          The Philippines expects soon to receive InternationalMonetary Fund approval for the country's economicstabilization program, Finance Secretary Jesus P. Estanislaosaid. Mr. Estanislao said he expects an IMF review team tomake a recommendation today to all members of the fund'sexecutive board for approval before the end of the month. TheIMF's approval would significantly boost the Philippines'chances of receiving loans and debt relief from otheragencies and donor countries.                                                                                                          URUGUAY CABINET APPOINTMENTS                                                                                                          Ignacio de Posadas, a National Party senator, was namedUruguay's economy minister, succeeding Enrique Braga, whosepolicies of privatization and fiscal austerity causedopposition. Two weeks ago, President Luis Lacalle demandedand received resignations of all 12 of his ministers. But Mr.Lacalle said his economic program won't change.   Eduardo Ache, an economist from the opposition ColoradoParty, was named minister of industry, energy and mining,succeeding Augusto Montes de Oca.                                                                                                          MOLDOVA'S DEBT CRUNCH                                                                                                          Moldova is unable to repay its share of the former SovietUnion's foreign debt, Radio Moldova reported. Prime MinisterValeriu Muravschi was quoted as telling Parliament thatMoldova would be willing to give up its share of Sovietproperty if Russia agreed to repay the entire debt.Parliament will study the issue. Moldova would be the secondrepublic, after Ukraine, to pull out of an agreement lastOctober by 12 former Soviet republics to jointly repay thedebt, estimated at $65 billion to $70 billion.                                                                                                          ARGENTINA CANCELS IRAN DEAL                                                                                                          Argentina canceled an $18 million deal to supply nuclearequipment to Iran because of concern the material might beused to develop weapons, a Foreign Ministry official said.Last month, the Argentine government suspended the shipmentof unspecified nuclear equipment, saying it wanted to reviewthe contract. Argentina, which has Latin America's mostdeveloped atomic program, helped Iran service the core of anuclear plant in 1988.                                                                                                          IMMIGRATION TO ISRAEL                                                                                                          Immigration to Israel of Jews from the former Soviet Unionwas nearly half the expected level last week, continuing adecline in new arrivals to the Jewish state, officials said.Officials attributed the drop to Israel's worsening economy.An estimated 700 immigrants arrived last week. In January,6,200 Jews arrived, the lowest level in two years. About350,000 immigrants have come to Israel since 1989, mostlyfrom the former Soviet Union.                                                                                                          RUSSIAN PRIVATIZATIONS                                                                                                          Russia plans to step up the pace of privatization thisyear but will continue to limit foreign ownership of assets,a government official said.   Anatoly Chubais, chairman of the Committee on StateProperty, told a news conference that regional committeescharged with privatizing state assets had been ordered &quot;tospeed up their work.&quot; Nearly all property was owned by thestate in the former Soviet Union, and the transfer to privateownership is the biggest sell-off in any of the old East bloccountries. The Russian Parliament passed a privatization lawin July.   Mr. Chubais said that though foreigners will be allowed tobuy property in Russia, there will be limits on what they canown so that Russians can compete with rich outsiders.   Separately, Paul A. Volcker, former head of the U.S.Federal Reserve, is considering a job as adviser to theRussian government, his assistant said. Mr. Volcker, 64 yearsold, was offered the post during talks last week in Moscowwith Russian officials.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali,who took office Jan. 1, announced the first stage of a majorstaff shake-up, involving a net reduction of 14 high-levelposts and the elimination of almost as many departments andoffices. . . .
