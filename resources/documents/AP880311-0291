Analysts say prospects of good summer demand and indicationsthat major producers might take action to help curb the recentslide should help boost prices in coming months.   Unconfirmed reports that the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries was studying a plan to shave 850,000 barrels from itsdaily production sent futures contracts soaring on Thursday, andthat rally continued today.   Near midday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts forApril delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.crude, stood at $16.19 per 42-gallon barrel, up 19 cents fromThursday, when the price closed up 51 cents at $16.00.   Refined products also built on Thursday's strong advance.Wholesale heating oil, up 0.90 cent Thursday, stood at 44.44 centsper gallon, up another 0.51 cent. Wholesale unleaded gasoline stoodat 45.55 cents per gallon, up 0.41 cent after leaping 1.14 centsper gallon to close at 45.14 cents Thursday.   James Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc. Commodities, said traderswere encouraged by reports that OPEC was considering cutbacks, eventhough cartel officials later denied that the purported idea of 5percent output cuts for all 13 members except Iraq was gettingserious consideration.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries also indicatedthat its pricing committee was unlikely to meet soon, despite callsby member Venezuela for a meeting.   But Steel said futures traders pushed prices higher because thereports suggested the cartel was at least taking some action todeal with the declines before they started getting out of hand.   In the Persian Gulf, for example, crude recently has beenselling at levels between $13 and $14 per barrel _ far below OPEC's$18-per-barrel target _ while in the United States, West TexasIntermediate has been bouncing in the $15-to-$16 range afterselling near $18 in January.   Analysts have blamed the slump on sluggish worldwide demand andswelling inventories, worsened by an unusually warm winter inEurope.   Some OPEC members, desperate to preserve their market shares,have aggravated the decline by discounting prices to lure customersaway from OPEC competitors and ``NOPEC'' countries, such as Mexico,Britain, Norway and a host of other smaller nations.   Dillard Spriggs, president of the Petroleum Analysis Ltd.consulting firm, said crude prices could fall another dollar in twoweeks if world production does not slow down quickly.   In a worst-case scenario, buyers might then disappear to waitfor even lower prices, heightening downward price pressure.   ``But chances are probably pretty good they'll rein it in,''Spriggs said, citing prospects for increased summer demand. ``Ithink we're in this cycle of up-and-down that will go on untilabout 1990.''   Analysts said OPEC's problem was that the production quotas thecartel set at its December meeting simply were too high.   Since December, OPEC's official aggregate quota has stood at17.5 million barrels a day. Spriggs said the cartel would have tocut production to about 16.8 million barrels daily to match demandand bring prices back to its $18-per-barrel target.   As a result, cartel members had to discount the extra barrels tosell them, said Ed Krapels, of the Washington-based Energy SecurityAnalysis Inc. consulting firm.   Still, Krapels said, ``the worst is over,'' because demandshould pick up during the summer driving season.   ``We expect the situation to be a little easier for OPEC tohandle in the next three months than in the last three,'' he said.   At the Oppenheimer andamp; Co. securities firm, oil analyst Paul Tingsaid he also believed oil prices will head higher, continuing in acycle of ``strengths and weakness.''   OPEC is all too aware of the billions of dollars of income itlost by casting off production constraints in 1986, he said.   ``Back in 1985, nobody in his right mind would have thought oilcould drop below $18 a barrel. They got quite a surprise when itgot down to $8. I think they're not likely to repeat that again,''Ting said.   ``I think they're going to get their acts together (because)they really can't live at prices significantly below $18 for a longtime,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
