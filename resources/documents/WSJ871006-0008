Many traders predicted that yesterday's light volume and narrow trading range will continue to characterize the currency markets until the U.S. trade data for August are released Oct. 14.    &quot;For the moment, (the market) seems very willing to stay in check,&quot; James T. McGroarty, vice president, foreign exchange, at Discount Corp. of New York, said.    In the wake of last week's Washington meetings -- at which finance officials from the major industrial powers expressed a strong commitment to keep exchange rates stable -- market participants may be reluctant to take on new large currency positions, dealers said.    The dollar firmed as trading began in Asia. It was supported by the effects of last week's monetary talks in Washington, continuing concern over the Persian Gulf war and expectations that next week's U.S. trade report will show a narrowing deficit.    But buyers backed away as the currency hit 147.42 Japanese yen, which turned out to be the day's high. It thus stayed below the level of 147.50 yen that has been identified on technical trading charts as a major point of resistance.    The dollar eased to its intraday low of 146.55 yen in late New York trading, compared with 146.85 yen late Friday. It performed similarly against the West German currency, slipping on the day to 1.8395 marks from 1.8450.    The Canadian dollar, which climbed to 76.48 U.S. cents from 76.39 cents Friday, wasn't affected by the tentative U.S.-Canadian trade pact announced over the weekend, dealers said.    Explaining the modest movement in exchange rates yesterday, Mr. McGroarty of Discount Corp. said much of the market seemed paralyzed by the determination expressed last week by world finance officials to closely manage currency rates.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's suggestion that nations use an index of gold and other commodities to guide monetary policies was particularly intimidating or confusing to some traders, Mr. McGroarty said.    &quot;The market seems to be mesmerized by all this,&quot; he said.    However, he said, Mr. Baker's suggestion probably was only a &quot;trial balloon&quot; for such a system. In any event, he said, it would take some time for any such mechanism to become operational.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $2.80 an ounce to $457.30 in light trading. Estimated volume was two million ounces.    The dollar was quoted at 146.60 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    Gold was quoted at $457.10 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---              Late New York Trading               Monday, Oct. 5, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
