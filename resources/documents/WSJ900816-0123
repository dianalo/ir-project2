The first British crewsarriving from their base in Cyprus were astonished to hearthat their usual summer uniform -- shorts -- was banned inSaudi Arabia under Islam's strict code of modesty, whichprohibits men from showing their knees.   Multinational military missions are always fraught withdifficulties, but the delicate synthesis now under way inSaudi Arabia is likely to prove more troublesome than most.The U.S. troops now pouring into the Dhahran air base will beworking at a facility with the best infrastructure money canbuy -- and with an almost totally untested air force.</LP><TEXT>   They also are entering a Moslem society so closed andconservative that the government never has issued touristvisas, women are veiled, alien religious symbols such ascrucifixes are banned, and Jews are rarely admitted. ManySaudis are appalled by the idea that U.S. forces almostcertainly contain some Jews, and the presence of U.S.servicewomen working on aircraft violates every Saudi custom.Misunderstanding can be total. &quot;They blame us,&quot; says a malemilitary specialist. &quot;They can't understand why we make ourwomen do such things.&quot;   Dhahran's underground command facilities and elaborateshelters are better equipped than NATO's. The shelters, theirentrances shielded and camouflaged, can service four aircraftat a time and house crews for 30 days without resupply.Dhahran is &quot;a base the U.S. would love to have,&quot; says onemilitary expert.   But opinion is divided on the quality of Saudi troops.&quot;The best help they could provide to the U.S. forces would beto stay in their barracks,&quot; says one U.S. colonel who servedin Saudi Arabia. Others are more measured. &quot;It's a spectrum,&quot;says a former key U.S. official in Dhahran. &quot;If I had to gointo battle and I could pick {the pilots flying with me}, Iwouldn't mind at all.&quot;   A former White House security adviser says, &quot;It's hard tosay how the Saudi air force will perform, because it's onlybeen tested once.&quot; In 1984, Saudi F-15s downed Iranian F-4sthat had penetrated Saudi air space. However, U.S. E-3Aaircraft helped target the Iranians and U.S. tankers refueledthe Saudi planes.   The Saudi air force hasn't been around long enough toprove itself. Attempts to establish an air defense actuallybegan in 1930 but faltered until 1980, when a nervous Saudiroyal family, eyeing the fall of the shah in Iran, called onthe U.S. to help.   The Pentagon rushed in, challenged by the task ofproviding a defense for Saudi Arabia's vulnerable oil fields.In the flat, featureless desert, targets stand out as ifmarked with bull's-eyes. A single strike on a major facilitysuch as the water-injection plant that pushes out the oilcould cripple production for as long as two years. In suchterrain, nature is merciless. In summer, thermal air currentscan blind radar, and sandstorms strafe delicate equipment.   The U.S. military came up with an exhaustive -- andexpensive -- plan, only part of which has been realized.Opposition led by backers of Israel blocked several plannedsales of arms to the Saudis. Equipment that was deliveredoften was modified to placate fears that Israel's securitywould be compromised.   For example, Saudi planes weren't supplied with thesecure, jam-proof communications systems the U.S. Air Forceuses, which are invaluable in a dense air battle. Withoutsuch units, Saudi pilots fighting an engagement alongsideAmericans won't be able to communicate fluidly.Theoretically, the inferior Saudi system can be swapped for aU.S. kit in about four hours. The Pentagon won't comment onwhether this has yet been done.   In arguing for the Saudi arms deals, the Pentagon alwaysmaintained that the close military ties forged by such saleswould be of vast benefit to the U.S. in a crisis such as theone that sprang up when Iraqi forces invaded and took overneighboring Kuwait two weeks ago.   Major arms sales certainly created contact. After SaudiArabia purchased sophisticated airborne radar planes known asAwacs, around 1,000 U.S. technicians, trainers and advisersheaded for the desert. Their influence created an air forcepatterned on its U.S. counterpart both in organization and intactical doctrine. Young Saudis went to Phoenix, Ariz., fortraining and returned wearing U.S.-style nicknames on theirflight suits.   &quot;Saudi pilots act a lot like U.S. Air Force pilots,&quot; saysa Pentagon official. &quot;That's what happens when you haveongoing relations with another force.&quot;   But a lot of misunderstandings happen, too. Being afighter pilot is a prestigious position for young Saudis.Many royals, such as the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., PrinceBandar, wind up in flight school, and such young men aren'tused to brusque military discipline.   &quot;You can't say `You dummy, you did it wrong,' and youcertainly learn not to chew a guy out in front of his peers,&quot;says a former U.S. trainer. &quot;I think the British&quot; -- who alsosupply aircraft and training to Saudi Arabia -- &quot;are betterthan us at making these kinds of cultural adjustments.&quot;   But Don Kerr, a Briton who worked for seven years as aninstructor at a Saudi air academy, recalls that he too had tomake adjustments: &quot;A student would disapper for severalmonths and then turn up, explaining that his father had diedand, as eldest son, he had an irrevocable duty to go home andtake control of the situation.&quot;   He recalls classes containing both princes and humbleBedouin tribesmen. In many ways, the Saudi pilot selectionsystem is more egalitarian than the West's; recruits areselected straight from high school, without the requirementof a college education. Most start with intensiveEnglish-language instruction. Fluency is essential becauseall technical manuals are printed in English andinternational aviation works in that language.   &quot;Arabic has few technical terms,&quot; a U.S. aircraft engineerworking in Saudi Arabia says. &quot;If you try to talk about anengine component, you're left with saying the equivalent of`the machine inside the machine.'&quot;   The engineer, whose job includes training, says many Saudiyouths don't have the kind of mechanical background that manyU.S. boys pick up almost casually. &quot;In the States, if you'rea kid trying to change the wheel on your bike and you'reholding the wrench wrong, your dad'll reach over and put yourfingers into the right grip. These boys' dads never had abike, so they come to me starting right from scratch.&quot;   Given those constraints, Saudis' achievements areremarkable. Pilots now fly some of the most sophisticated anddifficult fighter planes in the world. One Saudi astronautflew a mission with the U.S. space shuttle.   But the next few weeks could provide an acid test of Saudiproficiency and U.S. training. They also will surely providea test of U.S. military diplomacy. As one young U.S.helicopter pilot put it, &quot;The people in this part of theworld can be awfully easy to offend.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
