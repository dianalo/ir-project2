In comparisonwith the conventional mid-range TCT-80A, the new TCT-300 has fewer componentunits, is smaller and weight less, thus reducing significantly the spacerequired for installing the system. A smaller focus X-ray tube and a512-channel detector deliver improved image quality in comparison withthe conventional model. In addition, operation has been made easier.The console panel has been improved, and the hydraulically operated patientcouch has been made lower.</TEXT></DOC>
