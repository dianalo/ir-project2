The Community Agency for Social Enquiry said in a studythat of 146 violent acts in the Johannesburg area from July22, 1990, to May 1, Inkatha was reported to be the aggressorin 96, the South African police in 19, the ANC in nine andthe South African Defense Force in seven. Inkatha supportersreportedly used AK-47 machine guns 12 times, while ANCsupporters never used them, the study said.   Because of continuing violence, the ANC has suspended itsfull participation in negotiations with the government, whichare intended to lead South Africa to democracy. Witnesses toviolence in black townships often charge the police withassisting Inkatha.   The Inkatha Institute for South Africa said the study wassuperficial and distorted, and called the Community Agency a&quot;highly politically partisan&quot; group.                                                                                                          STRINGS SEEN ON CHINA TRADE                                                                                                          Warren Williams, president of the American Chamber ofCommerce in Hong Kong, said he doubts the U.S. will extendmost-favored-nation trading status to China withoutconditions. President George Bush has until June 3 to extendthe preferential tariff deal, though Congress may veto itbecause of Beijing's human rights record, trade surplus,trade practices and arms sales.                                                                                                          JAPAN MAY EASE IMPORT BAN                                                                                                          Japan might be willing to ease its ban on rice imports andcould decide on a partial opening of that market next month,Tokyo officials said. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, meetingwith U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle, hinted at a compromiseif other countries resolve unspecified issues ininternational trade talks this summer. Japan has resistedU.S. pressure to overturn the rice import ban, imposed topromote self-sufficiency in the staple food. Japan'spowerful, subsidized farm lobby maintains it can't competewith cheaper rice imports.                                                                                                          FRANCE TURNS TO NUCLEAR ADS                                                                                                          Electricite de France today opens a six-week, $2.2 millionnational ad campaign for nuclear energy, a first for thestate electric company, which said its previous publicrelations efforts were defensive and reactive. Nuclear powerfrom 56 plants supplies France with 75% of its electricity;no other Western nation depends less on energy imports. ButEDF said, &quot;The public only had negative information aboutnuclear power.&quot; The ads' target isn't those who opposenuclear power but those with mixed feelings.                                                                                                          ISRAELI WORK DISPUTE FLARES                                                                                                          Secular Israelis accused Rabbi Menachem Porush, deputylabor and welfare minister, of waging a cultural war byenforcing a loosely observed law against employing Jews onSaturdays. Mr. Porush sent Arab Druze inspectors to citebusinesses operating without permits on the Jewish sabbath.Critics view his drive as part of an attempt byultra-Orthodox Jews, 15% of the population, to impose theirwill on the secular majority.                                                                                                          SEOUL'S SOCIALIST TRADE GROWS                                                                                                          South Korea's trade with socialist countries, includingChina and the Soviet Union and Eastern European nations,jumped 47% to $1.28 billion in the first quarter, comparedwith a year earlier. The two-way trade figure included $523million in South Korean exports, up 55%, and $763 million inimports, up 41%. Seoul predicted this trade segment willtotal $7 billion this year, up 51% from 1990. South Korea inthe past two years has established diplomatic or traderelations with most of the socialist countries.                                                                                                          PACIFIC CORAL REEFS DAMAGED                                                                                                          Coral reefs, which provide breeding grounds for marinelife, are being seriously damaged across Southeast Asia andthe Pacific and could become underwater deserts, scientistsand development workers in Guam said.   Pollution, mining and tourism are among the main causes ofthe damage, along with sedimentation produced by the erosionof land that results from indiscriminate logging. More thantwo-thirds of the world's coral reefs are in Asia.   The Philippines-based Asian Development Bank said in arecent report that coral reefs &quot;are comparable to tropicalrain forests in terms of productivity and diversity&quot; andurgently need protection.   The worst-hit region is Southeast Asia, especially thePhilippines and Indonesia, where rapidly growing populations'demand for food has increased land use and pressured fragileecological systems. Around Suva, the capital of Fiji, thewaters are heavily polluted and the reef system ispractically dead. Reefs in Palau, Yap island and Guam, andthe Great Barrier Reef off Australia are in good to excellentcondition.
