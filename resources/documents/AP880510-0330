(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mazda Motor Corp.'s assembly plant,which builds the new Ford Probe and the Mazda MX-6, nearly hasfinished hiring and has begun training workers for the secondshift, company officials said Tuesday.   When the second shift begins production in June, the $550million plant will employ nearly 3,000 assembly and 400 salariedworkers, Mazda spokesman Jim Gill said. The plant began buildingcars in September.   By August, when it reaches full production, the plant will becompleting 240,000 cars a year. More than 60 percent of them willbe Probes built for Ford Motor Co. to be sold through the FordDivision.   But until then, Ford's 4,500 dealers will have to settle for asmall trickle of the sporty two-door hatchbacks, which they say arein such demand they are moving at premium prices.   Probe's official introduction is Thursday as a 1989 model, butdealers have had them for several months. Ford Division GeneralManager Thomas Wagner said the plant's Probe production is sold outthrough October.   ``Whatever we get we sell immediately. We can't keep them,''said Irma Elder, owner of Troy Ford.   ``It's a good buy, it's sporty, well-priced, economical todrive. What more can you ask? Since February people have beencoming in asking for Probe.''   Unfortunately, Elder said, she doesn't get many. The first onewas sold as soon as she got it, so she had to convince the buyer tolet her keep it in the showroom for four weeks so other customerscould see it.   John Blackwell III, executive vice president of Blackwell FordInc. in Plymouth, said customers are paying over-sticker prices toget the Ford-designed cars which have been engineered and built byMazda.   Both dealers said the front-wheel-drive Probe fills a void inFord's lineup and will not replace the popular rear-wheel-driveMustang.   Elder and Blackwell were among several members of the Forddealer council who toured the high-tech Mazda plant on Tuesday.Ford owns 25 percent of Mazda and the plant sits on the site ofFord's defunct Michigan Casting facility.   The highly automated factory includes the final assembly plant,plastics shop, paint shop and metal-stamping plant. It uses robotsthroughout, even to perform tasks such as putting the spare tire inthe trunk.   It also boasts some ideas not found in other U.S. assemblyplants, such as a hanging conveyor tilted at a 30-degree angle,making it easier for workers to attach parts to the cars'underbodies.   Probe comes in three versions. Standard equipment on allincludes a 2.2-liter engine with 12 valves, four cylinders andfuel-injection, four-wheel independent suspension, powerrack-and-pinion steering and power front-disc brakes andretractable headlights.   The base Probe GL starts at $10,711. The Probe LX starts at$11,695 and the Probe GT starts at $13,845. All prices includingtransportation and handling charges.</TEXT></DOC>
