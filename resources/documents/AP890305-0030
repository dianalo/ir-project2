(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state university that has played hostto a Communist convention, CIA protests and a building takeover byangry minorities is facing student unrest from an unusual cornerthese days: archconservatives.   The right-wingers on the campus that they like to describe as``so far left it's falling off'' have accused the University ofMassachusetts of violating their right of free assembly forstripping them of the privilege of renting meeting rooms because ofa brawl with a left-wing group, which lost the same privilege.   ``This is a leftist institution,'' said Republican Club PresidentTed Maravelias, a 20-year-old sophomore, who said he will file suitunless the 27,000-student school relents. ``This administration doesnot want to hear the conservative viewpoint.''   Club members brawled with members of the Spartacus Youth ClubFeb. 9 when the Republicans refused to leave a meeting of theMarxist group. One person was injured.   The scuffle was just the latest skirmish in the three-yearhistory of confrontations between political extremists at the campus100 miles west of Boston. Among other incidents:   _ The conservative student newspaper, The Minuteman, was thesubject of a meeting between students and administrators last monthbecause of disparaging comments about homosexuals. Universityspokeswoman Stacey Chase said the school is investigating ways to``distance ourselves'' from the paper, such as banning the use ofthe university name on the banner.   _ The Republican Club was ousted from its campus office in Mayafter a member pounded the wall separating the office from theheadquarters of the Lesbian, Bisexual and Gay Alliance and broke atape player belonging to the homosexual group.   _ Another campus group, the Distinguished Visitors Program, whichhad shared space with the club before its ouster, complained offrequent harassment and griped that a Republican Club memberanswered its phones, ``Hello, Young Communist League.''   _ Republican Club members yelled the words to ``God BlessAmerica!'' at demonstrators who tried to stop CIA recruiting at theuniversity in November 1986. Five months later, club members tossedbars of soap at a small crowd that rallied in support of Amy Carter,Abbie Hoffman and a dozen other activists on trial for chargesstemming from the demonstration.   The Republican Club president contends that conservatives are apersecuted minority on campus. ``Basically this is not even aliberal campus. It's a socialist one,'' Maravelias said.   The strong words of the small group of young conservatives havearoused the ire of many on a campus that is notable for its turmoil.   After the CIA protests of 1986, the university gained morenotoriety in November 1987 with a racial scuffle that injured 10students and in February 1988 with a week-long building takeover byminority students. A month later the school made headlines with theelection of a Communist as co-president of the student body.   Jason Rabinowitz, a founding member of the Young CommunistLeague, has become a frequent target of The Minuteman.   ``Certainly it's a progressive campus. For that reason, it is atarget for far-right groups,'' Rabinowitz said.   The conservative group first emerged in early 1986 with TheMinuteman, started with a $740 contribution from the U.S. IndustrialCouncil's Educational Foundation, which also gave a boost toconservative papers at Yale and Harvard universities.   The Republican Club now claims about 200 members, although schoolspokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins said a cadre of a few leaders and a scoreof followers runs the club and The Minuteman.   More moderate student leaders say the campus is polarized betweenpolitical extremes, and few in the middle take part or even vote.   ``To them, it's a sideshow. It's a calling-all-characters type ofdeal,'' said John Dunlop, co-president of the school's NortheastArea Government. He pointed out that only about 3,000 of theschool's 19,000 undergraduates voted in last year's election.</TEXT></DOC>
