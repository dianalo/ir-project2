In the interest of economy, he makes it clearthat whatever money and equipment is provided to Saigon is to comeout of the budgets of the U.S. military. He asks the Joint Chiefsof Staff ``to put together a new program that would enable theSouth Vietnamese to deal successfully with a combined VietCong-North Vietnamese threat,'' Clarke says. MACV is also told tocome up with a plan to improve Saigon's leadership abilities andreduce desertions.   _In September MACV replies: Even the increases in Saigon'sforces will not enable them to handle a combined Viet Cong-NorthVietnamese threat without direct U.S. combat assistance.   ``According to MACV, Saigon's armed forces could not be expandedbeyond the presently authorized manpower ceiling of 993,000, norcould they be improved qualitatively to the extent necessary todeal with a combined threat,'' Clarke writes. ``What the secretarywanted simply could not be done ... Neither Abrams nor his staffwas able to suggest any changes in Saigon's military organization,strategy or tactics that would enable the South Vietnamese to dealwith a combined enemy threat.''   Adm. John S. McCain Jr., Pacific commander, stresses the dangerof overtaxing Saigon's manpower and training capacity. He tellsLaird that ``further acceleration could prove self-defeating.''   _November. ``Laird refused to take no for an answer,'' Clarkesays. The secretary orders the services for the third time to comeup with a suitable plan and puts them on notice ``that a largeresidual support force was not in the offing.'' Laird wants an``imaginative'' plan that, he says, will address the ``criticalproblems of corruption, leadership, motivation and morale.''   _December. MACV complies, drafting a more optimistic plan. It isbased on the assumption, however, that there will be success forSaigon's expansion programs, progress on the battlefield and adeclining North Vietnamese Army threat and it ignores Hanoi'sforces massed just outside the borders of South Vietnam.   But even this new plan is tied to the existence of a largeAmerican residual support force, and Clarke says, Laird's staff``suspected that the military was still trying to use itsevaluations of South Vietnamese military capabilities to stall thewithdrawal process.''   _February, 1970. Laird revisits Saigon, communicates hisdisappointment over the lack of any new or fresh concepts. TheSouth Vietnamese ask for more arms, including 175mm artillerypieces that can fire over the demilitarized zone into North Vietnamand for financial assistance to raise soldiers' living standards.Laird returns to Washington and asks the military for an evenstronger plan.   _April. The Joint Chiefs of Staff gives Laird what he wants _and much of what Thieu is after. The new withdrawal plan givesSaigon two 175mm artillery battalions and other equipment andseparate ration supplements and dependent housing support forThieu's troops.   With that, the Abrams-Laird struggle over Vietnamization ended.The withdrawals continued throughout 1971 and 1972 without a break.   On the diplomatic front, the United States, South Vietnam, NorthVietnam and the Viet Cong signed the Paris Peace Accords on Jan.27, 1973, removing the one remaining obstacle to total U.S.withdrawal _ Hanoi's agreement to return American prisoners of war.The accords called for a cease-fire and set up an internationalbody to police it, but the agreement was almost immediatelyviolated and the war resumed.   By the end of 1973, the U.S. military contingent in Vietnam wasdown to 50 men; South Vietnam was left to fight its war alone.   On Jan. 8, 1975, the North Vietnamese politburo ordered a majoroffensive to ``liberate'' South Vietnam by a cross-border invasion.In March, in the face of the onslaught, Thieu withdrew his armyfrom the Central Highlands, a move that touched off countrywidepanic.   The cities of Hue and Danang fell. On April 11-13 the U.S.Embassy staff was evacuated by helicopter; on April 29, Saigon fellto the North Vietnamese and the war ended.   ``Vietnamization was not a stragegy for fighting or winning thewar, or even for achieving America's limited objectives in SouthVietnam,'' concludes Clarke.   ``At best, it was a political strategy for continuing U.S.support for a domestically unpopular conflict and, at worst, aface-saving abandonment of a commitment that American leaders feltthey could or should no longer honor.''   Says Laird: ``There was no other alternative. We had 570,000 menon the ground in Vietnam. We had 2 million Air Force and Navypersonnel supporting them. The Congress was fed up with Vietnam andso were the American people. The lesson from Vietnam should be thatwe should follow the advice that President Dwight Eisenhower gavewhen the French failed in Vietnam _ never get involved in groundwarfare in Southeast Asia.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
