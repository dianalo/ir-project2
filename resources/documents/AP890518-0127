The reporting was astonishing in its frankness, speed and clearsympathy with protesters for the heavily censored press.   ``One Million From All Walks of Life Demonstrate in Support ofHunger-Striking Students,'' read the banner headline on thePeople's Daily, the official organ of the Communist Party.   Protests since mid-April have gone largely unreported, and manyChinese relied on Western media coverage for accurate accounts.   ``Large-scale Demonstrations in More Than 20 CitiesNationwide,'' read the headline in the Guangming Daily. It was oneof seven front-page stories on the protests.   ``The condition of the students and the future of the countrytouched the heart of every Chinese who has a conscience,'' thenewspaper said.   Chinese were hungry for news of the democracy movement.   ``There is no free press, and that breeds corruption,'' said XueYong, a novelist from Hebei province at Tiananmen on Thursday.``It's only in the last couple of days that we've seen fairlyobjective reporting. That's the great sorrow of China's media.''   ``We depend a great deal on the foreign press. We don't trustthe Chinese media,'' said a worker at a chemical factory.   It would have been hard for newspapers to ignore the story.   More than 1 million people swarmed into the streets of thecapital Wednesday to call for democracy. It was largest show ofpublic defiance in 40 years of communist rule.   Of six articles on the front page of the People's Daily, fivewere about the demonstrations. Only a small bottom corner wasdevoted to the historic visit to China by Soviet President MikhailS. Gorbachev for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.   The student protests began with the April 15 death of HuYaobang, an ousted Communist Party chief who pushed for democraticreforms. But the first sympathetic coverage came only on April 23,after journalists at the daily Science and Technology Newsthreatened to quit.   And it wasn't until this week that many newspapers followed suit.   When more than 3,000 students began a hunger strike on Saturday,a press emboldened by the Science and Technology News' articlebegan Western-like coverage. Newspapers carried accurate and fairlycomplete accounts of events and details of the students demands,including a free press.   Electronic media, though slower, have also picked up on thetrend.   Beijing TV interrupted programming four times Thursday with newsupdates on the demonstrations. China Central Television's eveningnews showed leaders visiting hunger strikers in a hospital.   Newscasters read letters from viewers calling for authorities toagree to meet with the fasters.</TEXT></DOC>
