On the New York Cotton Exchange, the March-delivery orange-juice contract traded higher by nearly its five-cent-a-pound limit before closing at $1.7065 a pound, up 1.15 cents. Analysts said the rally reflected traders' jitters about cold spells in orange-producing states in the critical freeze period that has just begun.    Trading opened higher on wire-service reports of a Christmas freeze centered in the San Joaquin Valley, California's main citrus area. Temperatures were mostly in the mid-20s, but &quot;in general not cold enough to do any significant damage,&quot; said Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of Weather Services Corp., Bedford, Mass.    The California-spurred rally occurred despite the fact that it is Florida, which hasn't had weather problems so far, that accounts for 71% of U.S. orange output, almost all of it for juice. California, by contrast, accounts for 27% of U.S. output, only a quarter of that for juice. &quot;They're likely to sell you an orange while Florida, they'll sell you juice,&quot; said Paul Redstone, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York.    Still, Florida has had six freezes in the past eight seasons, and traders are wary of any hints of widespread crop destruction, analysts said.    Some traders see an indirect effect on orange-juice prices from a California freeze, said Judith Weissman Ganes, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York. If the California crop is sufficiently damaged, there might be more demand for more fresh fruit from Florida to compensate, she said.    Even so, &quot;the California crop is certainly small. It's certainly not the same impact (on the market) as a freeze in Florida,&quot; said Ms. Ganes. She said yesterday's futures price jump &quot;was just overreaction.&quot;    As for Florida, weather patterns in recent years indicate the current mild-to-warm temperatures in the Southeast will turn sharply colder by early January, Mr. Leavitt said.    &quot;There are some hints we'll see much colder weather in the Southeast from this weekend and further,&quot; Mr. Leavitt said, adding that a small amount of light frost sometimes helps orange crops.    There is another irony for traders who bet that California's weather troubles might deplete Florida's orange supply. The California weather may increase -- rather than drain -- the number of oranges available for juice, according to a preliminary damage report being put together late yesterday by the California Agricultural Statistics Service.    According to Ronald Radenz, deputy state statistician at the service, the main effect of the &quot;light-to-moderate&quot; crop damage in California groves probably won't be unusable oranges, but a &quot;downgrading&quot; of many oranges from table-fruit quality to juice use.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Futures prices rose sharply amid continued bearish sentiment over the dollar. A statement by a White House spokesman that the U.S. wants &quot;stability&quot; in the dollar helped trim currency futures' gains, but the comment wasn't expected to have a lasting effect. Analysts said reports of intervention by foreign central bankers did little to help the embattled dollar. &quot;People are interpreting the intervention as designed to smooth the dollar's decline rather than to halt it,&quot; said Marc Chandler, foreign-currency-futures analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. Analysts said there is disappointment that the U.S. didn't do more to cut its budget deficit and that the Group of Seven major industrial nations didn't do more to try to halt the dollar's slide. &quot;Everything has just come to nothing,&quot; one analyst said of those widely watched efforts.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle-futures prices soared as another winter storm socked the Southwest and West. The live cattle contract for February settlement closed at 62.77 cents a pound, up 1.4 cents. Traders expect the storm to curtail marketings this week, said Charles Richardson, an analyst at Lind-Waldock andamp; Co., Denver. In addition, cold and snowy conditions hamper the animals' weight gains. Hog futures finished lower. Analysts said traders are worried that a backlog of hogs is building as storms prevent producers from bringing animals to market.    PRECIOUS METALS: Prices of gold, silver and platinum futures rose after the U.S. dollar plunged in overseas trading. Some gold traders said they were disappointed that, because of a dollar-boosting White House statement in the afternoon, gold for current delivery closed up only $1.60, at $487.70 an ounce, after trading up almost $5 earlier. The gold turnaround showed how &quot;fragile&quot; metals rallies are, one analyst said. Silver rose 4.2 cents to $6.842 an ounce, while platinum jumped $7 an ounce to $514.70. &quot;The dollar's been absolutely killed and we have no momentum to carry (gold) at all,&quot; complained one Commodity Exchange broker. However, Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group Ltd., New York commodity consultants, said he doesn't agree gold should have responded more strongly. &quot;The day-to-day relationship between gold prices and the dollar exchange rate isn't a great relationship,&quot; he noted. &quot;Gold reacts to a variety of things the dollar doesn't react to.&quot; When gold doesn't react to the dollar as people expect, added Mr. Christian, &quot;my reaction is 'I told you so.'&quot;    GRAIN AND SOYBEANS: No follow-through buying after the market's strong opening pushed most prices of grain and soybean futures lower, analysts said. A weak dollar and good demand for Malaysian palm oil helped the market open on a high note but the gains weren't sustainable in the thin holiday trading, analysts said. Soybean futures for January settlement at the Chicago Board of Trade, closed at $5.9325, down 10.5 cents for the day. </TEXT></DOC>
