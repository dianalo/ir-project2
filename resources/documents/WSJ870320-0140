This type of talk shouldn't frighten me, except that tonight I, too, am a narcotics agent. And now I am supposed to walk outside to a parked car -- my first &quot;solo&quot; -- and buy a half-gram of cocaine.    It is the &quot;final exam&quot; at a class run by Professional Law Enforcement Inc., a detective agency that does drug-surveillance work for small towns, high schools and some major corporations. Agents of PLE, a unit of privately held Massey Burch Investment Group Inc. of Nashville, Tenn., in recent months were behind more than 200 drug and other arrests at several General Motors Corp. plants and 137 arrests at or near a Whirlpool Corp. facility in Arkansas. PLE let this reporter attend a two-week training course for prospective agents, at the end of which, if possible, each trainee is to make a drug buy as part of a sheriff's-department undercover operation.    Things go wrong as soon as we reach the car. &quot;Do a snort,&quot; urges the dealer, drawing from his jacket a thimble-sized vial filled with white powder. &quot;It's what you'll be buying.&quot;    I had practiced faking cocaine use in a hotel mirror for days in anticipation of this moment. But my hands tremble as I fumble with the vial and a coke spoon disguised as a key. Recalling a tip, I bob my head in the seat as I draw the spoon to my nose, feigning fear of being seen by passing police. With the dealer's gaze momentarily diverted, I sniff, a bit too violently, while secretly sliding the white powder off onto my left thumb. Quickly I wipe my thumb on my pants while running the spoon over my gums.    &quot;You seem a little bit too much in a hurry,&quot; the dealer says. &quot;That makes me nervous. I don't even think you snorted that. Mind if I see some ID?&quot; Foolishly, I produce my wallet, flashing my driver's license and my library card.    But I balk when he suggests we snort a &quot;line,&quot; a procedure that is very hard to fake. &quot;Are we going to do the deal or not?&quot; I ask, not needing to fake my fear and anger. &quot;Let's just go back inside.&quot;    Inside, we walk to a bathroom to complete the buy. Here the deal is nearly blown again: Not only am I forced to run outside to break a $20 bill, but also I hand over the $50 before being given the vial, a cardinal sin for a narc. Still, I manage to do the deal.    My elation at that, however, vanishes an hour later. I learn that the deal was phony: The &quot;coke&quot; isn't coke, and the &quot;dealer&quot; is a PLE man. He is Gary Smith, a detective who later permits me to accompany him during part of an undercover drug investigation in Mason, Ohio.    The instructors explain that a trainee needs to be observed doing what he believes is a real drug deal. PLE's training, while not nearly as rigorous as the monthslong courses given federal Drug Enforcement Agency agents, is considered superior to that of many small agencies that only dabble in undercover work.    It is supervised by the portly Mr. Probst and another agent, Harry Sweigart. Mr. Probst, like a tourist checking his wallet, frequently flicks his hand to the pistol at his belt. He has reason to be jumpy: He has recently busted eight members of a motorcycle gang after living with two of them for months; he hears they have put a price on his head.    In the class besides me are two detectives and an 18-year-old woman targeted for undercover work in high schools. Most recruits are police officers, and the first step is to &quot;de-cop&quot; them. Shed immediately are black leather belts and black oxfords. The class is told to avoid jargon like &quot;perpetrator.&quot; Even posture may be changed. &quot;Don't walk with one arm swinging,&quot; one new agent is told. &quot;It's a cop walk.&quot;    Trainees, between learning to identify drugs and practicing buys before a video camera, hear lectures on topics ranging from how to discourage being frisked while wearing a tape recorder (&quot;You gay?&quot; sometimes works) to the quickest way to test the purity of cocaine (coke rubbed between the fingers for a minute will disappear, leaving behind the &quot;cut,&quot; any kind of powder used to dilute it). Tips range from the useful (&quot;stay away from cellular phones; neighbors can listen in&quot;) to the obvious (&quot;fistfights don't look good; plus, you may get whipped&quot;).    A seminar on pretending to use cocaine is a near-fiasco. Scott, a beefy police reservist from Michigan, repeatedly tips a cocaine spoon, showering rivulets of Sweet 'N Low down his shirt-front. Instructors warn me against my habit of dusting the &quot;cocaine&quot; off the table top. &quot;Do that for real and you'll have eight guys sniffing at your feet,&quot; one says.    The toughest task for some new agents, officers who may scorn drug users, is simply asking to buy drugs. &quot;Some cops just can't do it,&quot; says Mr. Probst with a shrug. The approach should be indirect and nonthreatening. Not &quot;I hear you have some coke,&quot; but &quot;Know anybody who has some coke?&quot;    And always haggle. &quot;Most cops will buy anything at any price,&quot; says Mr. Sweigart. &quot;Do that and you're made {exposed}. Talk 'em down. You'll look better to the dopers, and the city or company will love you for saving them money.&quot;    To acquire the tools of their trade, such as copies of High Times magazine to scatter around their home, new operatives visit a &quot;head shop&quot; filled with hundreds of carved and metal pipes, colorful glass &quot;bongs&quot; for pot-smoking, and drug stashes in the form of soft-drink and tennis-ball cans with screw tops. Don, a tough-talking homicide detective from Akron, Ohio, squats before a glass case and chooses two coke spoons and a kit for cutting cocaine. &quot;Jeez,&quot; he whispers, &quot;it's so funny standing here. I used to bust guys carrying this stuff and think, 'You dirtball.'&quot;    Not all excursions go smoothly. One night Mr. Probst, who sometimes feels compelled to revisit the scenes of his buys, tows us into the darkened streets of a rundown area in West Dayton to the clubhouse of a motorcycle gang. A blue Gremlin pulls behind us as we drive by. Circling to pass again, we meet the car at an intersection. A bearded face reminiscent of killer Charles Manson peers into our car, craning at us as we go by. &quot;Oh man, I busted that guy,&quot; Mr. Probst says. &quot;Hurry up.&quot; Five quick turns later we leave the neighborhood.    &quot;What a rush,&quot; Don says from the back seat.    &quot;Really,&quot; Mr. Probst says, staring ahead, touching his gun.    Undercover agents spend a lot of time looking for drugs, but sometimes the drugs find them first. One evening a group of narcs and narc trainees gathers at a striptease bar for drinks and debriefing. Talk of &quot;coke&quot; and &quot;buys&quot; apparently attracts attention. Before long, a scantily clad dancer cozies up in a chair next to me.    &quot;You like coke?&quot; she coos. I nod, and negotiations begin. &quot;My dealer comes in at two. Fifty dollars a half-gram. It's got crystals. It's just up from Florida. You'll love it.&quot;    A few detectives favor buying the drugs, but to do so would violate the rule against making a buy without clear authority from local law-enforcement officials. Besides, we've had plenty to drink. After somebody mutters, &quot;Honey, we're cops,&quot; the group quickly walks out of the dimly lit club, leaving the would-be dealer gaping.
