(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Just eight weeks after Florida's $55.1million jackpot eclipsed lottomania in California, the Golden Stateis back with a $55 million-plus jackpot that will be North America'srichest ever.   Lottery officials and merchants said ticket sales for Saturday'sdrawing already were double what an average Thursday would rake in.   The official estimate of ``over $55 million'' for the drawing isconservative, based on previous betting patterns in the two-yearhistory of California's computerized lottery game, said lotteryspokesman Bob Taylor.   ``Over $55 million'' could mean several million dollars over,officials acknowledge.   It all depends on how wildly Californians react to the1-in-14-million chance of winning the jackpot, which would be paidin an annuity of at least $2.75 million before taxes for 20 years,for the cost of a $1 lotto ticket.   The size of the jackpot depends on sales and jackpot rollovers,which fuel each other to produce the heavy gambling periods dubbedlottomania.   When no one picks all six winning numbers out of a choice of 49numbers, the jackpot is rolled over, or added, to the top prize forthe next twice-weekly drawing. Four rollovers, including a $33.4million jackpot Wednesday night, produced the current record prizeestimate.   The exact size of the jackpot depends on how many tickets aresold. Twenty cents of every $1 ticket feeds the jackpot.   The California lottery produced a $51.4 million jackpot, NorthAmerica's largest at the time, in June. It was evenly split betweentwo players, an aircraft mechanic and a supermarket clerk.   That record was eclipsed Sept. 3 by a $55.1 million prize inFlorida that went to a 63-year-old real estate broker.</TEXT></DOC>
