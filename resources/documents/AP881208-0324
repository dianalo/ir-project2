ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   LTV, the Dallas-based aerospace concern thathas produced Scout rockets for the government for the last 28 years,has been granted the exclusive right to produce and launch therocket commercially, the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration announced Thursday.   The Scout is used mainly for small science payloads.   The agreement with the Missiles Division of LTV Missiles andElectronics group is ``another important advance in establishing astrong U.S. commercial launch vehicle industry,'' the NASAannouncement said.   Since the first launch on July 1, 1960, there have been 112 Scoutlaunches. LTV said the value of contracts to date has been more than$350 million. Each Scout costs from $7 million to $12 million, fromstart through launching.   Since Aug. 15, 1986, when President Reagan ordered NASA out ofthe commercial launch business, NASA has signed such agreements withMcDonnell Douglas, maker of Delta rockets; Martin Marietta, whichmarkets Titans; and General Dynamics, manufacturer of Atlas-Centaur.   Each agreement is followed by others that convey the right to usegovernment launch pads on a cost-reimbursable basis.   American launch companies have contracts worth nearly $1 billionto launch 18 payloads through 1992. All the agreements were reache operationalsuccess rate of 95 percent, including37 successful launches in a row between 1967 and 1975.   Originally, the 75-foot-tall Scout could put a 131-pound payloadinto a 300-mile-high orbit. Today's rocket can lift 450 pounds intothat orbit.</TEXT></DOC>
