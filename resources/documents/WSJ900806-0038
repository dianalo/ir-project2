Over the weekend, the 12 nations of the European Communityand Japan voted to embargo imports of oil from the twocountries. The U.S. announced similar action last week.</LP><TEXT>   If all those countries in fact stand by their decisions,experts said, the ensuing scramble to find replacement oilelsewhere would test the world's production capacity andcould temporarily send prices soaring -- possibly as high as$30 to $35 a barrel, or $5 to $10 a barrel above currentlevels.   Aware of that, some members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries that are well out of range ofIraqi guns already are taking steps to raise output and fillat least some of the needs of former Iraq customers. And someoil ministers who have espoused moderate oil prices areprivately talking about possible emergency moves by OPECitself that might slow the price runup that began with Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait last week.   &quot;The market is hysterical,&quot; said a senior member of onecountry's OPEC delegation. &quot;A majority of the members don'twant to see prices get out of control.&quot;   But it isn't known just how much these countries can orwill do. If the major oil-consuming nations fully boycottIraqi and Kuwaiti crude -- or if pipelines and tankerscarrying oil out of those countries are blockaded --production elsewhere would have to rise as much as 4.5million barrels a day to fill the gap. That would take justabout all the spare production capacity available to worldoil producers.   And it is uncertain whether it all would be available.About two million barrels of it is in the hands of SaudiArabia, which during tense periods in the past has increasedproduction to stabilize oil markets. This time, the kingdommay not open its oil spigots wider, because doing so might beinterpreted by Iraq as an act of war.   &quot;We are in a fix,&quot; conceded one OPEC official.   Some people are skeptical that all the big oil-consumingnations -- particularly France and Japan -- can or will stickto their promises for long. &quot;It's Don Quixote stuff unless weget other countries to go along, especially the Japanese,&quot;said Edward Fried, senior fellow at Brookings Institution inWashington.   Also, a blockade of oil leaving Iraq and Kuwait so farhasn't been imposed. Such an action presumably would involveU.S. Navy ships stopping tankers leaving Iraqi and Kuwaitiports and a cut-off of pipelines that carry the bulk of Iraqioil exports across Turkey and Saudi Arabia to theMediterranean and Red Seas. It would be risky for Turkey andSaudi Arabia, probably inviting Iraqi retaliation.   Still, to the extent that efforts to impede Iraq's oilsales work, oil supplies could tighten in coming months.   &quot;If the embargo were successful, it would leave the worldshort of oil within three to six months,&quot; predicted LawrenceGoldstein, the executive vice president of Petroleum IndustryResearch Foundation. Adds Tom Burns, director of economicsfor Chevron Corp.: &quot;We're creating an oil shortage where onedidn't exist.&quot;   Joseph Stanislaw, managing director/Europe for CambridgeEnergy Research Associates, also sees a &quot;real price spike&quot; ifthe embargo holds, though he is convinced that others,particularly Saudi Arabia, eventually would step in and pumpmore oil to bring prices back down.   And even if the embargo is ineffective, most oil analystsexpect prices, already up almost $3 a barrel since Wednesday,to go higher on fear despite the fact that oil inventoriesare at a 10-year high. Only a few weeks ago, West TexasIntermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, had dropped to around$16 a barrel. In futures trading, this quality crude closedat $24.49 a barrel Friday, up $1.38 for the day.   &quot;We will definitely see another runup in crude prices,&quot;said Bryan Jacoboski, senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc.   There are signs that some added supplies may already beheaded to the market. Venezuela can increase production asmuch as 600,000 barrels a day and it is understood to havealready started.   A few other OPEC producers -- chiefly Nigeria, Indonesia,Libya and the Persian Gulf's United Arab Emirates, thoughunder threat from Iraq -- are capable of producing more oil.Most producers outside OPEC are running flat out.   Eventually, prices are expected to come down again,perhaps to about $22 a barrel. But they aren't expected tofall back to the old depressed levels because of the scarethrown into oil markets. Oil markets have both a &quot;mentalceiling&quot; and a &quot;mental floor&quot; for petroleum prices, saidAntonio M. Szabo, president of Bonner andamp; Moore ManagementScience.&quot;The mental ceiling just went up,&quot; he said.   As a result, the carefully crafted oil-production pactstruck by OPEC only 10 days ago that was designed to tightensupplies and gradually raise prices has been renderedmeaningless. Some experts suggest the existence of OPECitself may been threatened.   Even if OPEC survives, experts say it will never be thesame with two of its most powerful members, Saudi Arabia andKuwait, practically paralyzed by Iraqi military might. Suchan outcome would end an era of a strategy carefully plottedover the years by the two OPEC heavyweights. They guided OPECon a path that assured consumers a moderately priced yetsecure source of oil.</TEXT></DOC>
