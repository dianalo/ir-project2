That compares with a net loss of $324 million a year earlier, when the Cincinnati-based company had a restructuring charge of $459 million. Excluding the charge, Pandamp;G said it earned $135 million, or 77 cents a share.    Sales for the quarter, ended June 30, rose 19% to $4.97 billion from $4.17 billion.    Results were roughly in line with analysts' estimates. However, analysts noted that 4% to 5% of sales in the latest quarter were the result of business acquisitions and that the year-earlier net included an after-tax gain of about $15 million, or nine cents a share, from the sale of a bottling operation.    &quot;Apples to apples, it was a very strong quarter,&quot; said Jay H. Freedman, analyst at Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;The real surprise was the continued strength of business volume, growing in the 7% to 8% range.&quot;    The company said its tax rate was 37.8%, compared with 39.5% a year earlier. It added that foreign currency translations accounted for about a third of the increase in international earnings.    Analysts said Procter raised prices about 4% in the quarter to partially offset higher raw materials costs, mostly chemicals used in detergents, diapers and packaging. The maker of household, personal-care and food products declined to comment.    Daniel Meade, analyst at First Boston Corp., said price increases on cleaning products by Pandamp;G and competitors Unilver N.V. and Colgate-Palmolive Co. mark the first such increases in about four years, &quot;and consumers shouldn't rebel.&quot;    However, the price increases trail escalating raw material costs, analysts said, adding that they don't expect Pandamp;G's earnings to benefit until the fiscal 1989 second quarter.    &quot;Their gross margin will be under pressure in the first quarter,&quot; said Jack L. Salzman, analyst at Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., who forecasts that earnings in that period will be &quot;flat to modestly higher.&quot; Other analysts, however, estimate Pandamp;G's fiscal first-quarter earnings will be $2.20 a share to $2.35 a share. In the fiscal 1988 first quarter it had net of $356 million, or $2.09 a share, on sales of $4.66 billion.    &quot;The first quarter should be the toughest comparison, and the numbers should get better as the year goes on,&quot; said Kidder's Mr. Freedman. He estimates Pandamp;G's fiscal 1989 earnings at $6.75 a share, while other analysts' full-year estimates are about 10 cents a share to 15 cents a share below that estimate.    For all of fiscal 1988, Pandamp;G reported that profit jumped more than threefold to $1.02 billion, or $5.96 a share, from $327 million, or $1.87 a share. Excluding the $459 million restructuring charge, fiscal 1987 profit was $786 million, or $4.59 a share.    Sales for the year rose 14% to $19.34 billion from $17 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Pandamp;G shares closed at $72.50, down $1.125. </TEXT></DOC>
