Owens</HL><DATE>03/29/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><CO>   LABOR</CO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><LP>   More than half a year after it was passed, the Americanswith Disabilities Act still causes fear in the hearts of muchof American business. The law goes into effect in stages --the first stage, for businesses with 25 or more employees,comes in the summer of 1992. The ADA was written to removeobstacles -- in particular, the obstacle of discriminationthat limits employment opportunities for people with physicalor mental disabilities. But detractors argue that the ADA hasadded problems. They envision a morass of regulation andexpense for fancy technology or extra support staff.   To appraise the merits of this debate, it is important torecognize that the ADA is, in a way, a unique disability law.Its employment provisions are grounded in a supposition thatis totally opposite to that of other disability entitlementprograms. Disability entitlement in modern times has usuallybeen based on a medical and legal certification of inabilityto perform because of a mental or physical impairment. Thiscertification entitles the person with a disability tobenefits in lieu of earnings from work he cannot do. Thecosts for such disability entitlements are borne bygovernment, employers, insurance companies and privatecitizens.</LP><TEXT>   The price for such entitlements has been high. In 1986,disability payments for the population aged 18 to 64 were $86billion. Elaborate disability evaluation criteria andprocedures exist to ensure only those who meet certain&quot;inability&quot; standards are entitled to payments. Often,expensive disputes mean that people with disabilities end upstruggling to prove what they cannot do.   The ADA by contrast takes a &quot;can do&quot; approach. Entitlementguaranteed by the ADA employment provisions requires amirror-image way of looking at disabilities. Qualifiedpersons with disabilities are entitled to an opportunity toperform in accordance with their abilities. From this changedperspective, employers must first look at essential jobfunctions and then match these with a person's abilities. Ifa person with a disability can perform relevant workfunctions, the only issue is accessibility within the workplace. If qualified applicants and employees withdisabilities cannot perform essential work functions or fullyparticipate in other employment programs because of theirimpairment, they are entitled to have impairment-relatedbarriers removed through reasonable accommodation.   The employer for his part need not face a terrible burden.He is not required to provide accommodation that alters hisbusiness's function, is overly disruptive, or costs more thancan reasonably be afforded. A study commissioned by the LaborDepartment shows that one half of the accommodationsidentified in the study cost nothing. All that was needed waspractical help -- such as putting blocks under a desk so awheelchair can roll under. An additional 30% of cases costless than $500.   The success of the &quot;entitlement to perform&quot; viewpointhinges on the conviction that people with disabilitiesactually want to work. For those who argue that this is notthe case, and that extensive litigation using ADA protectionsmay extract costly settlements for work not done, there aresome facts to bear in mind. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973sets a precedent. It requires that both the federalgovernment and certain government contractors adhere toalmost identical rules as the ADA and there has not beenexcessive ligation under this law. (What litigation there hasbeen provides useful guidance for ADA implementation.)   Experience has also shown that the disabled want to work-- and work well. Sears Inc. has had a policy to includepersons with disabilities in its work force since 1947. PaulScher, who is a manager for the Sears Selective Placement andRehabilitation program, maintains that persons withdisabilities employed at Sears are motivated employees and doat least as well as other employees. Du Pont Co. has longbeen active in employment of persons with disabilities.Published studies of Du Pont's experience show that workerswith disabilities perform as well as or better thanco-workers and that fears of safety and absenteeism areunfounded.   Employers who are preparing for the ADA should keep the&quot;entitlement to do&quot; in mind. If you are an employer, firstbecome familiar with the basic provisions of the law. Thenreview hiring, promotion, performance, training, benefit andother programs to ensure that they can meet the intent of theADA and can be made accessible to persons with disabilities.Judge qualified persons with disabilities on their abilitiesand, on a case-by-case basis. Make candidates for employmentwho are disabled, as well as current employees who becomedisabled, aware of their rights. A reasonable nondefensiveapproach to the implementation of the ADA can be moreproductive and cheaper than looking for detailed rules andregulations to limit or evade ADA responsibilities.   The ADA is really a straightforward law, best understoodin the context of this nation's renewed drive forindividuality. People in this era have fought against beinglimited because they are members of a category -- ethnic,racial or gender. Instead they have insisted on beingconsidered as individuals who pursue their own purposes.Persons with disabilities seeking employment are marked bytheir purpose. They are looking for an opportunity to do workin exchange for pay. Disability as an entitlement to a fairchance to perform in accordance with abilities deserves aninvestment in time and money at least comparable todisability as an entitlement to compensation.   ---   Ms. Owens specializes in disability-related benefit andinsurance issues for Thomas L.
