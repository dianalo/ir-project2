Gorbachev may withdraw 50,000 to100,000 troops from Europe this year to kick off a new round ofEast-West negotiations on conventional forces, a U.S. official saidTuesday.   A unilateral Soviet pullback would have ``little impactstrategically,'' said a U.S. official, but the political effectcould be major in Europe, where polls show high regard forGorbachev on arms control issues.   The official said 50,000 to 70,000 Soviet troops might bewithdrawn. Another U.S. official said as many as 100,000 Red Armytroops could be pulled back within Soviet borders from positions inEast Europe.   While the two officials spoke on condition of anonymity, formerDefense Secretary Harold Brown predicted that Gorbachev might tryto throw Reagan off balance at the Moscow summit May 29-June 2 byannouncing a unilateral withdrawal.   Brown told reporters he would not be surprised if the Soviets``move spectacularly on the conventional arms control front.''   The withdrawals could come from among the estimated 380,000Soviet troops kept at a high state of readiness in East Germany.   U.S. officials trying to anticipate Gorbachev's summit strategyalso have detected hints that he will suggest a fifth summitmeeting before Reagan leaves office in eight months. The projectedsites are Vienna or Budapest.   Another summit would give the two sides more time to work on atreaty to cut their strategic nuclear weapon arsenals by 30 percentto 50 percent. Reagan had hoped to make the treaty the centerpieceof his visit to Moscow, but negotiators are stymied over the U.S.Star Wars anti-missile program and means to verify compliance withthe pact.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz acknowledged after makingfinal summit preparations last week in Geneva with Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that ``it is now clear there is noway these questions can be shaped up in treaty form in time for thesummit.''   The two sides have agreed on a ``confidence-building measure''that was negotiated as part of the treaty but which Reagan andGorbachev are likely to sign during the summit as a separate deal,another U.S. official said.   It provides for advance notification of all U.S. and Sovietmissile test launchings, including those from submarines, as wellas the approximate target location.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said theproposal for the summit signing was made by Defense Secretary FrankC. Carlucci and accepted by Soviet Defense Minister Dimitri Yazov.   Because no major agreements are to be signed at the summit, U.S.officials foresee it as an event to consolidate improvements inU.S. Soviet relations since Gorbachev took office in 1985 and beganthe summit meetings.   At the same time, U.S. officials were preparing for possiblesurprises.   At Reykjavik in 1986, Gorbachev seized the initiative withsweeping proposals to slash nuclear weapons.   This time, U.S. officials said, Gorbachev may propose reducingground forces in Europe by 25 percent and opening negotiations inVienna in late fall.   The United States and its 15 North Atlantic Treaty Organizationallies have balked at new talks on conventional arms until theSoviets fulfill the human rights pledges they made in the 1975Helsinki accord.   Senior U.S. officials said Shevardnadze told Shultz there soonwould be some practical moves by Moscow in the area of religiouspractices and religious education. He did not offer any details,but his statement was taken seriously by the U.S. side.   The conventional force negotiations between NATO and theseven-nation Warsaw Pact would supersede to Mutual and BalancedForce Reduction talks that began in 1973 but failed to produce anagreement on cutting troops on the Central European front.   Reagan administration officials are hopeful now becauseGorbachev seems to have accepted the principle of the West'sargument that ``asymmetry'' _ the geographic and possible numericaladvantages _ of the Warsaw Pact must be addressed in negotiations.   ``The Soviets can afford to take significant cuts withouthurting their military capability,'' the U.S. official said. ``Thefirst U.S. objective is to get the Soviets down to NATO levels.''   Pentagon and other estimates of NATO and Warsaw Pact troopstrengths vary widely _ from a 900,000-man edge for the East to a200,000 Western edge.   Where the Warsaw Pact has a decided lead is in tanks andartillery. The Pentagon estimates the Soviet-led alliance has52,000 tanks compared with 20,000 in NATO, and 43,000 artillerypieces compared with NATO's 18,000.</TEXT></DOC>
