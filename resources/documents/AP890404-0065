Mutinoussoldiers surrendered control of the airport and returned to theirbarracks.   State television announced Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, commander ofthe Leopards Battalion; Col. Phillipe Biamby, commander of thepresidential guard; and Col. Leonce Qualo, an administrativeofficer at army headquarters, were given safe passage to the UnitedStates.   A government communique identified Rebu, Biamby and Qualo asleaders of what it called a ``foolhardy'' attempt Sunday tooverthrow the government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.   The president ``magnanimously'' decided to release the officersand they were escorted to the border of the Dominican Republic onMonday night to get a flight to an undisclosed city in the UnitedStates, the communique said. Rebu was accompanied by his wife andfour children.   The government did not explain why the three men were freed, butthe move was clearly meant to defuse resistance within the LeopardsBattalion. At least four mutinous soldiers in the battalion werekilled Monday in skirmishes with troops loyal to Avril. The rebelswere demanding Rebu's release.   Independent Radio Haiti-Inter said rebel units of the LeopardsBattalion withdrew Monday night from the Port-au-Prince airport,but the airport remained closed. Schools also were closed for asecond day.   Avril assumed power six months ago in a coup led bynon-commissioned officers who said they were disgusted by officialcorruption and human rights abuses.   On Monday night, presidential guardsmen in tanks battledLeopards commandos on a main throughfare between the airport anddowntown Port-au-Prince.   Radio stations gave conflicting casualty reports, saying four toeight Leopards were killed and several wounded.   Nine members of an independent council appointed to organize andschedule presidential elections were to be sworn in today, but theceremony was postponed until Thursday because of the violence,officials said.   Avril said in February he was forming the council, anannouncement many Haitians welcomed as a sign of democratic timesto come.   The leader of this impoverished Caribbean nation has promisedelections and pointed as proof he is keeping his pledge to thecouncil, which is to include representatives of the Roman CatholicChurch, labor unions, the military, human rights groups, the mediaand judiciary.   Rebel soldiers made three demands over Radio Haiti-Inter onMonday. They said they wanted Rebu released, a civilian governmentinstalled and total restoration of a 1987 constitution restrictingthe army's role in government. Those parts of the constitution weresuspended in June.   Radio Haiti-Inter cited sources close to the police command asreporting that Avril had determined a ``handful of soldiers andofficers were involved'' in Sunday's coup attempt.   Avril said on nationwide television early Monday that the coupwas led by ``some members of the armed forces, blinded by theirexhorbitant ambitions,'' but gave no details.   Avril was seized early Sunday by rebel troops, but rescued byloyal forces later in the day. No casualties were reported Sunday.   There was speculation the coup attempt may have been linked toAvril's crackdown on drug trafficking by the military. Last week,four high-ranking army officers were accused of drug dealing andarrested.   The troops that installed Avril as president ousted Lt. Gen.Henri Namphy on Sept. 17, 1988. Namphy had led the country for mostof the time since a February 1986 popular uprising forced dictatorJean-Claude Duvalier into exile, ending 30 years of Duvalier familyrule.   U.S. officials have conditioned the restoration of $70 millionin suspended economic aid on Haiti moving toward democracy,respecting human rights, and cracking down on the drug trade. Thefunds were suspended after thugs massacred 34 voters in November1987, aborting Haiti's first elections in 30 years.</TEXT></DOC>
