In the request, the dealers allege they paid a total of $779,000for computers they never got.   The FBI said it will investigate Leading Edge's businesspractices to determine if there has been a violation of federal law,according to Tuesday's Boston Globe.   The Canton, Mass.-based company, which pioneered the market forlow-priced IBM personal computer clones, stopped deliveringcomputers last month, leaving hundreds of dealers owed millions ofdollars.   Leading Edge demanded advance payment, an unusual move thatdealers say they agreed to because of the large demand for thecomputers.   The dealers who signed the bankruptcy petition are seeking tofreeze Leading Edge's assets, pending a thorough examination of thecompany's finances and business dealings. Leading Edge reportedlyowes dealers more than $10 million.   ``From my viewpoint, at least we'll know the score veryshortly,'' said Larry Stone, president of OmniTek Computers Inc. ofPortland, Ore., and a co-signer of the petition. ``We think there ismaybe something there that we don't see and don't fully understand.''   Stone said Leading Edge owes him $190,000 and that he decided tosign the petition when ``it became pretty apparent the action wasgoing to proceed with or without me.''   Earlier this month, Stone organized a Chicago meeting of 50Leading Edge dealers to consider the company's signed agreement tosell its brand name and major business to a computer dealer based inRiviera Beach, Fla.   Michael Shane, founder and president of Leading Edge, said he wasdisappointed by the petition in bankruptcy court.   ``We cannot let 2 percent of the dealers divert attention fromaccomplishing what's in the best interest of all the dealers,''Shane said.   Shane said he was unaware of any FBI plan to investigate hiscompany.   Leading Edge is currently under a temporary restraining orderissued for unrelated litigation prohibiting the company from sellingits assets.   Leading Edge Products is the parent company of Leading EdgeHardware Products.</TEXT></DOC>
