Variation of the relativehydrogen concentration with incident dose is represented by a decayingcurve which consists of two components having the different hydrogenrelease cross sections. For each ion the cross section thus determinedwas found to be an increasing function of its electronic stopping powerin the fresh polyethylene sample within the depth region tested.</TEXT></DOC>
