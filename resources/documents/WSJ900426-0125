Sunday, April 29, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: &quot;The Story of theBeach Boys: Summer Dreams.&quot; It seems devilishly hard for TVto re-create the mood of the 1960s, so it's all the morestriking when this nicely acted saga of one of the decade'sbest-known bands actually succeeds.                                                                                                          Sunday, April 29, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: &quot;Caroline?&quot; Abeautiful woman (Stephanie Zimbalist) shows up on thedoorstep of a rich family, claiming to be their long-lostdaughter. Is she real, or is she a gold digger? Pamela Reed,George Grizzard, Patricia Neal and Dorothy McGuire co-star inthis &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; presentation.                                                                                                          Mondays, April 30-May 21, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;InsideGorbachev's U.S.S.R.&quot; Hedrick Smith is the host of thisfour-part series looking at the hopes and fears stirred up byglasnost and perestroika -- to say nothing of burgeoningnationalism (more in Monday's column).                                                                                                          Tuesday, May 1, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Other People'sMoney.&quot; Public TV's &quot;Frontline&quot; already was following thestory of Charles Keating Jr. last October, when the HouseBanking Committee began holding hearings on his crumblingLincoln Savings andamp; Loan. Naturally, the producer, MarionGoldin (formerly of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;), persisted. This filmpresents all the muck she managed to rake.                                                                                                          Wednesday, May 2, 9-10:45 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Eat a Bowl ofTea.&quot; This 1989 feature film -- produced and directed byWayne Wang, and based on a 1961 novel by Louis Chu -- is oneof the best entries in this year's &quot;American Playhouse.&quot; Itis set in New York's Chinatown in 1949, shortly after therepeal of the &quot;exclusion laws&quot; prohibiting the entry ofChinese women into the U.S. When a young Chinese-Americanintroduces a Chinese wife into the aging, depressed &quot;bachelorsociety&quot; of the older generation, the results are as poignantas they are hilarious.                                                                                                          Thursdays, May 3-June 7, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;InspectorMorse.&quot; In three new two-part mysteries, John Thaw returns asthe Oxford police inspector who (to paraphrase James Joyce)is a poet among policemen and a policeman among poets. Thebad news is that the first film contains a lot of contrivedcamera work that adds nothing but a distracting artiness. Thegood news is that the second two films were made by steadierhands.                                                                                                          Friday, May 4, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Richard NixonReflects: An American Interests Special.&quot; In conjunction withthe recent publication of his new book, &quot;In the Arena: AMemoir of Victory, Defeat and Renewal,&quot; and the imminentopening of the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda,Calif., former President Richard M. Nixon appears in anextended interview with Morton Kondracke, host of BlackwellCorp.'s regular series, &quot;American Interests.&quot;                                                                                                          Sunday, May 6, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: &quot;Burning Bridges.&quot;&quot;Emotional honesty&quot; was the slogan back in the liberated1960s. But is it really wise to reveal one's true feelings toeveryone in one's life? To judge from this TV movie starringMeredith Baxter-Birney and Nick Mancuso, the answer is anemphatic &quot;no.&quot;                                                                                                          Mondays, May 7-June 4, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Skyscraper.&quot;First, consider that some architects are now dreaming of500-story-high buildings. Then relax and enjoy this seriesabout the design, politics and construction of the downrightpuny (47-story) Worldwide Plaza in midtown Manhattan.</TEXT></DOC>
