(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The investigation into the military's$150-billion-a-year purchasing system is ``exanding andcontinuing,'' a prosecutor said after the first jury convictions inthe Pentagon procurement scandal.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica said Thursday afterguilty verdicts were obtained against California businessmen GeorgeKaub and Eugene Sullivan that his office is moving ahead with theinvestigation into kickbacks and payoffs.   Kaub and Sullivan, former vice presidents of TeledyneElectronics of Newbury Park, Calif., were the first people to gotrial as a result of the investigation, which began in mid-1986.   About a dozen people and defense contracting firms had pleadedguilty, including three men who were indicted with the Teledyneexecutives in January. Teledyne Industries, the parent of TeledyneElectronics, had also pleaded guilty to conspiracy and filing falsestatements in advance of the trial. The company paid about $4.3million in fines, penalties and damages.   A jury deliberated nearly 36 hours over four days before findingboth men guilty of conspiracy and wire fraud in a schemeprosecutors said involved paying a private consultant who in turnbribed a Navy engineer for illegal assistance in helping Teledynewin a lucrative contract.   Kaub was also convicted of filing false statements, a chargethat derived from providing documents to the Defense Departmentwhich omitted information about private consultants.   The jury failed to reach a verdict on the conspiracy and wirefraud charges against Dale Schnittjer, another former Teledyneexecutive. U.S. District Judge Richard Williams then dismissed thecharges. All the defendants were found innocent of bribery.   Aronica called the convictions ``significant'' and said theymarked only the start of the prosecutorial phase of the Ill Windinvestigation. ``The investigation is expanding and continuing,''he said.   Mark Tuohey, Kaub's attorney, said he would appeal the guiltyverdict against his client, who faces a maximum sentence of 40years in jail and a fine of $2 million for conviction on eightcounts. Kaub hung his head and stared at the defense table afterthe bailiff read the verdict.   Sullivan, whose lawyer, George O'Connell, said he would alsoappeal, could be sentenced to 20 years in jail and fined a maximumof $1 million. He appeared impassive after hearing he had beenconvicted on four counts.   Williams set sentencing for June 7.   Aronica argued during the trial that the defendants knew privateconsultant William Parkin engaged in illegal practices whenTeledyne Electronics hired him in November 1985 to help secure a$24 million contract for hand-held radar equipment.   Parkin, who had already pleaded guilty and was cooperating withthe government, was paid an initial $10,000. After Teledyne won thecontract in July 1987, he began receiving payments on an additional$150,000 that the company had promised him.   Defense attorneys, however, said their clients were the victimsof a conspiracy devised by Parkin, consultant Fred Lackner, Navyengineer Stuart Berlin and Michael Savaides, another formerTeledyne employee who worked in Washington and had pleaded guilty.   Like Parkin, Lackner and Berlin were indicted at the same timethe executives were and entered guilty pleas.   Much of the evidence in the case came from wire taps on Parkin'stelephone. The wire fraud counts stemmed from those tape-recordedconversations.   Schnittjer's attorney, Stanley Mortenson, said his client cameto Teledyne Electronics after the company had been awarded theradar contract.   But Aronica said Schnittjer was the person who paid Parkin about$18,000 he was to receive once the Pentagon ordered the equipmentfrom Teledyne.   The jury found Schnittjer innocent of four wire fraud counts,but it could not reach a unanimous decision on whether Schnittjerwas guilty of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud.   Williams dismissed those counts.   The Pentagon procurement investigation was publicly disclosed inJune 1988, when federal agents armed with search warrants descendedon defense contractors from coast-to-coast.</TEXT></DOC>
