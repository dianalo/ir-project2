The double unit supersectionutilizes two continuous miners operating simultaneously off a split ventilationsystem where intake air is brought up through centrally located entriesand is returned in entries on both sides of the advancing panel. By consolidatingtwo continuous miner sections into a double unit supersection, the overalllevel of production can be maintained at a lower cost per ton. 3 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
