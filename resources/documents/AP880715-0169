The Labor Department said the hot, dry weather searing much ofthe nation sent prices of unprocessed grain and poultry soaring bymore than 20 percent last month, pushing raw food prices 4.2percent higher than in May. It was the biggest jump since October1985.   Food prices rose a lower, but still substantial, 1.1 percent atthe wholesale level, one step before retail stores. Economists saidthat it was only a matter of time before price bulges at earlierproduction stages show up on supermarket shelves.   ``Food price inflation looks like it will be with us for manymonths to come,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the BostonCo. ``The report suggests to me that we remain in the beginningstages of a potentially spiraling inflationary process with norelief in sight.''   Other analysts, however, were less pessimistic, pointing to adrop in energy prices and generally modest increases in other areas.   Energy prices fell 1.6 percent, with a 7.1 percent decline infuel oil leading the way. Gasoline and natural gas fell 2.4 percentand 1.0 percent respectively.   ``That's a real break because the last few times we haddroughts, we also had double-digit increases in energy prices,''said Michael K. Evans, a private economic consultant in Washington.   ``Energy prices are heading down for the rest of the summer,''he said, noting a sharp drop between mid-June and mid-July in theprice of crude oil, to the lowest level in nearly two years.   Subtracting the effects of volatile food and energy prices,wholesale prices rose 0.3 percent last month, the same as in May.Analysts consider this rate a better indication of underlyinginflationary pressures in the economy.   In other economic news:   _The Commerce Department said the U.S. trade deficit roseslightly in May to $10.9 billion, up from $10.3 billion in April.But the imbalance was still the second smallest in almost threeyears. Both exports and imports increased.   _The Federal Reserve Board said production at the nation'sfactories, mines and utilities rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June,the ninth consecutive month without a decline. Production atutilities surged 2.6 percent, primarily for air conditioning duringthe heat wave.   _Business inventories in May rose a moderate 0.6 percent to$728.4 billion, held in check by a 0.9 percent jump in sales, theCommerce Department said. Sales rose to $483.7 billion.   June wholesale price increases pushed the Labor Department'sProducer Price Index for finished goods to 107.9, meaning that aselection of goods costing $100 in 1982 cost $107.90 last month, 40cents more than in May. This calculation is not adjusted forseasonal variations, as are other calculations in the report.   If the June price rise held for 12 straight months, theinflation rate would be 4.6 percent annually, more than double the2.2 percent rise of 1987.   For the first half of 1988, prices one step short of retail roseat a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6 percent. Excluding foodand energy, wholesale costs rose at 4.0 percent rate over thatperiod.   Although overall wholesale prices rose a modest 0.3 percent inJanuary and fell 0.2 percent in February, they've been up 0.4percent or 0.5 percent from March through June.   The Consumer Price Index, which tracks prices at the retaillevel and also includes services and imported goods not in thewholesale price report, has risen at a seasonally adjusted annualrate of 4.4 percent over the first five months of the year, thesame rate as for all of 1987.   Consumer price figures for June will be released next week.   Stacy Kottman, an economist with Georgia State University inAtlanta, said the worst effects of the drought may not be felt byconsumers until late this year because meat prices will initiallycome down as farmers slaughter animals rather than pay expensivefeed prices.   Cattle prices, for example, fell 5.2 percent in June while hogprices were down 4.0 percent.   But when the drought-related slaughtering tapers off, curtailedsupply will drive up the price of meat, he said.   ``It takes anywhere from 12 to 14 months to raise a calf frombirth to slaughter size so it will be well into nxt year and early1990 before meat prices can come down again,'' Kottman said.   The Labor Department offered these details from its producerprice report:   _At the unprocessed level, wheat was up 25.3 percent; corn, 24.3percent; turkeys, 22.8 percent; soybeans 22.0 percent; andchickens, 22.5 percent.   _At the finished-goods level, prices for eggs rose 16.0 percent;turkey, 9.3 percent; chicken, 7.3 percent; and fresh fruit, 6.7percent. Vegetable prices dropped 5.7 percent and rice was down 2.2percent.   _Also at the finished level, passenger car prices were up 1.0percent; women's clothing, up 1.0 percent; home electronicequipment, down 2.2 percent; and cosmetics, down 0.6 percent.   The Producer Price Index measures the price of goods at threelevels of production: crude or unprocessed (for example, wheat orcotton), intermediate (flour or cloth) and finished (wholesalebread and clothing).</TEXT></DOC>
