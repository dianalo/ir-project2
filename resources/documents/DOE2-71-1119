<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-71-1119 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Long Range Master Plan for the Defense Transuranic Waste Program (DTWP),or ``Master Plan,'' details current TRU waste management plans and servesas a framework for the DTWP. Not all final decisions concerning activitiespresented in the Master Plan have been made (e.g., land withdrawal legislation,the WIPP Compliance and Operational Plan and the TRUPACT Certificateof Compliance). It is the goal of the DTWP to end interim storage andachieve permanent disposal of TRU waste. To accomplish this goal, asmuch TRU waste as possible will be certified to meet the WIPP AcceptanceCriteria (WAC). The certified waste will then be disposed of at WIPP.The small quantity of waste which is not practical to certify will bedisposed of via alternative methods that require DOE Headquarters approvaland shall comply with the National Environmental Policy Act requirementsand EPA/State Regulations. The definition of TRU waste is ``without regardto source or form, waste that is contaminated with alpha-emitting transuraniumradionuclides with half-lives greater than 20 years and concentrationsgreater than 100 nanocuries/gram (nCi/g) at the time of assay. Headsof Field Elements can determine that other alpha contaminated wastes,peculiar to a specific site, must be managed as transuranic waste.''</TEXT></DOC>
