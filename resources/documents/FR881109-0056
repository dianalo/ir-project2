Subsequentto that publication, SWPA received several comments which expressed concernover a perceived lack of opportunity to comment on two particular phrasesin the policy. This publication provides interested parties the opportunityto comment on those phrases as the phrases pertain to the allocation policy.The first phrase appears in the last sentence of the first paragraph ofthe summary on page 29881 in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. That sentence reads as follows: ``As a resultof these changing conditions, Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA)believed a policy was needed to address the allocation of power and energythat may become available for marketing from existing and new, Federallyand non-Federally funded, hydroelectric power projects.'' The phrase ``fromexisting'' caused concern with some members of the public. We added thatphrase because new power from existing resources occasionally becomes availablefor allocation from a variety of sources including, but not limited to,new hydroelectric power development at existing projects, upgrading ofequipment, and changes in operational agreements. Power may also becomeavailable if an existing customer relinquishes or loses its allocation.The second phrase appears in the second sentence of SWPA's response tocomment number 11 located on page 29883 in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The sentence reads as follows: ``While the Governmentis presently committed to an announced policy of not removing a Federalallocation, the Government will not guarantee the disposition of its resourcesbeyond present contract commitments.'' The phrase ``the Government willnot guarantee the disposition of its resources beyond present contractcommitments'' was the cause of concern. This phrase refers to the mannerin which allocated power is delivered, reflecting the type of service tobe recieved by a customer. These is no assurance that the storage now availablein the hydroelectric power projects will be available for future hydroelectricpower generation, nor is there assurance that the present hydroelectircpower plant equipment, transmission facilities or systems, wheeling arrangements,etc., will be available beyond present contract commitments. Although SWPAfully intends to renew power allocations when existing contracts expire,provided Federal capacity is available, SWPA cannot guarantee the extensionof existing contracts.Neither of these phrases is intended to imply that an existing power allocationmay be withdrawn at the end of contract commitments. Present announcedpolicy is that capacity power allocations will continue to be honored beyondpresent contract commitments (with available resources) under SWPA's allocationpolicy, subject to appropriate administrative due processes, recognizingpubic laws and the policies of the Department of Energy.SWPA coordinated the full development of the August 12, 1987, allocationpolicy with its customers through their Southwestern Power Resources Association.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be submitted on or before December 9, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments may be mailed to: Francis R.
