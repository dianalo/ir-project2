Louis Durbin, senior vice president of Uranium Resources,said the companies plan to ask Canadian tax officials to ruleon the matter. In the meantime, Dallas-based UraniumResources said it has delayed indefinitely a shareholder voteto approve the acquisition.</LP><TEXT>   Rio Algom, a mining concern based in Toronto, agreed inMay to acquire the 92% of Uranium Resources it doesn'talready own for $6.40 a share, or a total of about $41million. Uranium Resources management controls about 52% ofthe company's shares.   Mr. Durbin said the tax problem arose because UraniumResources previously had merged with another company thatonce was incorporated in Canada. As a result, he said, RioAlgom might have to pay more tax to the Canadian governmentthan the companies originally had anticipated.   &quot;The potential incremental tax liability is enough that itchanges the economics of the acquisition for Rio,&quot; saidMichael Moore, vice president, corporate development, atUranium Resources.   Uranium Resources said Rio Algom plans to evaluate the taxsituation and recent problems with Uranium Resources'production before deciding whether to continue with theproposed acquisition. A Rio Algom official wouldn't comment.   Mr. Moore said that uranium output at Uranium Resources'only producing property, located in south Texas, is runningat about half the expected rate of one million pounds a yearbecause of bacterial contamination of the ore. The companysaid it will begin chemically treating the ore, which itexpects will increase uranium production within two to threemonths.</TEXT></DOC>
