In 6{ hours of testimony Thursday before a House investigativesubcommittee, Frederick H. Joseph, the chief executive of DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc., also defended the firm against allegations ofmanipulation of the $160 billion junk bond market.   Drexel, a leading Wall Street investment firm, is the granddaddyof the high-yield, high-risk bonds and underwrites around 40percent of all junk bonds issued.   The securities are designed to allow companies without a trackrecord of earnings to get financing based on whether they havesufficient cash flow to pay off their debts. They pay higherinterest rates than those of established companies and are viewedas riskier investments.   Michael Milken, chief of Drexel's junk bond trading unit inBeverly Hills, Calif., who pioneered the bonds, was a lot lesstalkative than Joseph at a hearing Wednesday before theinvestigations subcommittee of the House Energy and CommerceCommittee.   Milken, who has been under investigation for the past year and ahalf by a federal grand jury that is reported to be probing insidertrading, refused to testify and cited his Fifth Amendmentprotection against self-incrimination.   Behind the spotlight, the junk bond market seems to have quietlyrisen like a phoenix from the ashes of the October stock marketcollapse, as worries about a recession have subsided.   The resurgence of corporate ``takeover fever'' earlier this yearalso gave junk bonds a shot in the arm, since many of the issuesare used to finance acquisitions.   Some of the companies that have used junk bond financing, suchas businesses in the steel and chemical industries, have performedwell recently _ helped by a weaker dollar that made their exportsmore attractive. After the crash, there had been concern thatfailures of vulnerable companies could cast a shadow on the junkbond market.   ``There's an ongoing need for high-yield securities,'' saidRobert Waill, a managing director of investment firm L.F.Rothschild andamp; Co. and the head of its junk bond research department.   Waill believes more funds will be attracted to junk bonds in thecoming months, as investors switch big sums of money now parked inmoney-market funds into high-yield mutual funds featuring junkbonds. The money-market funds, based on prevailing interest rateson Treasury bonds, have been yielding relatively low returnsrecently.   Junk bonds are purchased mainly by big financial institutions,and most individual investors buy them through high-yield mutualfunds.   The bad publicity now surrounding the bonds _ with congressionalinvestigators portraying Drexel as a greedy firm that elbowed itsown clients aside so top employees could profit on hot new issues _won't hurt the market, traders insist.   ``This has been going on for 18 months; it's a littleanti-climactic by now,'' Waill said, referring to investigations ofjunk bond trading and the congressional hearings.   Drexel's Joseph told the House panel he expects the junk bondmarket to expand substantially over the next 10 years, since lessthan 10 percent of the companies that could get financing byissuing the high-yield bonds have done so.   In the last 10 years, the market has grown explosively, fromless than $25 billion in junk bonds in 1977 to around $160 billionlast year _ or 25 percent of the $650 billion corporate debt market.   Joseph pointed to cable television as an example of an industryripe for the bonds, saying cable companies tend to have lowearnings because of their high investment costs initially but alsohave great profit potential.   The average company issuing junk bonds is about 36 years old,has around $1 billion in assets and employs more than 4,000 people,Drexel says.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions April 30-May 1</NOTE></DOC>
