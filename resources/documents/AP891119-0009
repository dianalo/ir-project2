Federal mediator Doug Hammond said he recommended terms thateventually were accepted by both sides in a 14-hour bargainingsession that ended about 3:30 a.m. PST.   Union leaders were divided on the offer, but the majority saidthey would recommend approval.   A ratification vote by members of the International Associationof Machinists and Aerospace Workers was set for Monday night.   Terms of the three-year contract proposal were withheld pendingthe vote.   At Hammond's request, negotiators from the company and the unionreturned to the bargaining table Saturday, the third such attemptto find agreement since the strike began Oct. 4.   The walkout is the longest for Seattle-based Boeing since 1948.   Chief Boeing negotiator Larry McKean said strikers could be backon the job as early as Wednesday morning, adding that he was``certainly elated to have a tentative agreement here.''   Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751 inSeattle, which represents nearly four-fifths of the workers coveredby the union, and Justin Ostro, an international vice president whocoordinates aerospace industry negotiations for the union, tookopposite positions on the contract.   Ostro said it failed to increase wage rates beyond what Boeinghad proposed since Oct. 2, two days before the strike began,although it did boost production bonuses. But Baker called thesettlement ``a substantial improvement'' over previous Boeingoffers.   Ostro said the recommendation to accept came on a 3-2 vote ofthe union bargaining team, on which he does not vote. Both sideswill argue their cases before members cast their ballots onratification, he added.   Baker said ratification was favored by negotiating team membersrepresenting 55,000 of those covered by the union.   Hammond said his decision to submit his own recommendation tothe two sides for settlement was ``an unusual and for me a rarestep'' that he has used only once before in his 15 years with theFederal Mediation and Conciliation Service.   Boeing's previous offer included wage increases of 4 percent thefirst year, then 3 percent each of the other two years; annualbonuses of 10 percent of gross pay the first year, then 4 percentthe other two years; a reduction in mandatory overtime; andacross-the-board increases in retirement benefits.   The strike caused airlines, in the midst of industrywide andhighly competitive expansion, to have trouble getting planes theyhave ordered. Boeing has delivered 22 planes since the strikebegan, though it had hoped to deliver 94 in the last three monthsof 1989.   At least six of Boeing's major customers last week reporteddelays in receiving new planes, and some said they had to alterplans for expanding or inaugurating service.   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder would not comment last week on thedelays. He said only that production work was being done bysupervisors and any machinists who have crossed picket lines.   Boeing estimated 5.5 percent of Seattle-area machinists and 40percent of those at its Wichita, Kan., plant have gone back towork. Union estimates were much lower.   Machinists represent more than 57,000 Boeing workers, includingabout 43,000 in the Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita, 1,700 inPortland, Ore., and a few hundred at sites in a half-dozen otherstates.   Boeing's longest strike was 140 days in 1948 by machinists. A1977 machinists' strike lasted 45 days.</TEXT></DOC>
