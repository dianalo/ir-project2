The Secretary will consider any public comments receivedin determining whether or not to approve the plan or amendment.Amendment 3 would require that all vessels must offload sea scallops withina twelve hour time window each day as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,p6,6/7,i1,s20,xs40</C> <H1>State</H1><H1>Daily Time Period for Offloading</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Maine and New Hampshire <D>7 a.m. to 7 p.m. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut <D>5 a.m. to 5 p.m. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia <D>6 a.m. to 6 p.m. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida <D>12 noon to 12 midnight</D></ITAG></ITAG> The purpose of Amendment 3 is to improve the enforceability of the meatcount/shell height management standards for landed scallops. The offloadingwindow covers different time periods in different states where sea scallopsare offloaded in order to accommodate local industry practices. The offloadingwindow reduces, by half, the time when enforcement agents can sample (weigh)scallops in order to establish compliance with the meat count/shell heightsize standards. Under Amendment 3, offloading scallops outside the timewindow would constitute a violation of the FMP'S implementing regulations,regardless of the actual meat count/shell height measurements of the offloadscallops.Proposed regulations proposed to implement Amendment 3 are scheduled tobe published within 15 days.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 650</ITAG>Fish, Fisheries.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
