<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-82-0696 </DOCNO><TEXT>The directions of methylation and protonation in 2-methylthio-6-aminopurineand its 3-, 7-, and 9-methyl derivatives only coincide in the case ofthe 3- and 7-methyl derivatives, whereas methylation of the 9-methylisomer takes place mainly at N{sup 7} and protonation at N{sup 1}. Aproposal is made about the role of steric hindrances created by the orthosubstituent to attack by the methyl at N{sup 1}. The compounds form dicationsin trifluoroacetic acid.</TEXT></DOC>
