For cellkilling, the authors found no differences between x-ray and Y-ray responsein either line, but P3 cells are about twice as sensitive as V79 cellsto both of these radiations. For neutrons, P3 cells are 1.6 times assensitive as V79 cells. Both types of cells are killed more efficientlyby neutrons than by x-rays with relative biological effectiveness (RBEs)of about 6.3 for V79 cells and 3.6 for P3 cells. To investigate the molecularbasis for the high lethality of JANUS neutrons in the P3 cells, theycompared the yields of DNA breaks and DNA-to-protein crosslinks causedby JANUS fission-spectrum neutrons, with yields produced by x-rays, gamma-rays,and nonionizing radiation. With regard to breaks, the yields obtainedafter x-rays and gamma-rays were identical. The RBE for DNA breakagefor JANUS neutrons was about 8 relative to x-rays, 70 breaks per genomeper lethal event. This finding provides evidence that lesions other thanthose measured so far are important in the killing of cells by neutrons.</TEXT></DOC>
