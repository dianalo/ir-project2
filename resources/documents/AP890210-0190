On South Africa:   The most obvious form of racism, in the strictest sense of theword, to be found today is ``institutionalized racism.''   This type is still sanctioned by the constitution and laws of acountry. It is justified by an ideology of the superiority ofpersons from European stock over those of African or Indian originor ``colored,'' which is, by some, supported by an erroneousinterpretation of the Bible. This is the regime of ``apartheid'' orof ``separate development.''   This regime in the Republic of South Africa has long beencharacterized by a radical segregation in vast areas of public life,between the black, colored, Indian and white peoples, with only thelatter, although numerically a minority, holding political power andconsidering themselves masters of by far the greatest part of theterritory. All South Africans are defined by a race to which theyare officially assigned.   Although some steps toward change have been taken in recentyears, the black majority of the population remains excluded fromeffective representation in national government and enjoyscitizenship in word only. Many are relegated to ``homelands'' whichare hardly capable of being self-sustaining and are moreovereconomically and politically dependent on the central power.   South Africa is an extreme case of a vision of racial inequality.The prolongation of a state of repression, of which the majority ofthe population is victim, is less and less tolerated. Such asituation carries within it the seed of racist reflexes on the partof the oppressed, which would be as unacceptable as those of whichthey are victim today.   For this reason, it is urgent that these prejudices be overcomein order to build the future on the principle of the equal dignityof every person. Experience has shown moreover that peacefulevolutions are possible in this regard. The entire south Africancommunity, as well as the international community, must make everyeffort to promote a concrete dialogue between the principal partiesinvolved.   On anti-Semitism:   If anti-Semitism has been the most tragic form that racistideology has assumed in our century, with the horrors of the JewishHolocaust, it has unfortunately not yet entirely disappeared. As ifsome had nothing to learn from the crimes of the past, certainorganizations, with branches in many countries, keep alive theanti-Semitic racist myth, with the support of networks ofpublications.   Terrorist acts which have Jewish persons or symbols as theirtarget have multiplied in recent years and show the radicalism ofsuch groups. Anti-Zionism _ which is not of the same order, since itquestions the State of Israel and its policies _ serves at times asa screen for anti-Semitism, feeding on it and leading to it.Furthermore, some countries impose undue harassments andrestrictions on the free emigration of Jews.   On the dangers of science:   There is widespread fear that new and as yet unknown forms ofracism might appear. This at times is expressed concerning the usethat could be made of ``techniques of artificial procreation''through in vitro fertilization and the possibilities of geneticmanipulation. Although such fears are still in part hypothetical,they nonetheless draw the attention of humanity to the new anddisquieting dimension of man's power over man and thus to the urgentneed for corresponding ethical principles.   It is more important that laws determine as soon as possible thelimits which must no be surpassed so that such ``techniques'' willnot fall into the hands of abusive and irresponsible powers whomight seek to ``produce'' human beings selected according to racialcriteria or any other characteristic.   This would give rise to a resurgence of the deadly myth ofeugenic racism, the misdeeds of which the world has alreadyexperienced. A similar abuse would be to prevent the birth of humanbeings of one or another social or ethnic category through abortionand sterilization campaigns. Wherever the absolute respect for lifeand its transmission according to the Creator's intentionsdisappears, it is to be feared that all moral restraint on aperson's power will also disappear, including the power to fashionhumanity in the derisive image of these apprentice sorcerers.   On the United States:   It was only in 1964 that the Civil Rights Law put an end to allforms of legally practiced discrimination. This represented aconsiderable step forward, matured over a long period and marked bynumerous initiatives of non-violent nature. The Catholic Church,especially through its extensive educational system, as well asthrough the declarations of the Episcopate, contributed to thisprocess.   Despite ongoing efforts, much still remains to be done toeliminate completely racial prejudice and behavior even in what canbe considered one of the most interracial nations of the world.Proof of this is the statement adopted by the Administrative Boardof the United States Catholic Conference on March 26, 1987 whichpointed out the persistence of signs of racism in American societyand condemned the activity of racist organizations such as the KuKlux Klan.</TEXT></DOC>
