The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude oil, closed flat at $19.08 a barrel, unchangedfrom Monday, despite the final day of trading on the contract.Contracts for delivery later in the year posted slight gains.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasolinefor September delivery rose 0.76 cent to 53.58 cents a gallon. Othercontracts had smaller advances.   Domestic heating oil for September slipped 0.10 cent to 51.79cents a gallon and later contract months also declined.   Traders said that except for two brief buying spurts, one earlyand another shortly before the closing bell, activity was slow withproducts leading the way.   Crude for September delivery dipped to $18.88 during the session,but strong selling in the gasoline market helped recover some of thelosses.   ``Strength in gasoline helped hold up crude,'' said Jack Unger,energy broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.   Analysts said anticipation of a drop in U.S. gasoline stockshelped boost prices. The American Petroleum Institute releasesweekly inventory statistics on crude and refined products after theclose of trading on Tuesday.   Traders expect a rise in heating oil stocks and only minimalchanges in crude supplies, Unger said.</TEXT></DOC>
