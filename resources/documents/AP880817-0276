No question about it.   But credit card users could be hurt even worse.   First reactions to the increases focused almost entirely onhousing, since by far the greatest variable debt is owed in thiscategory. But interest on most home mortgages remainstax-deductible; most credit card debt isn't.   Moreover, much credit card interest is at rates actually doublethat on many home mortgages. In addition, many credit card usersincur fees that, if added to the posted rate, would bring it beyond20 percent a year.   Credit card debt is especially sensitive, too. Whereas most homemortgage loans vary only on a six-month to three-year basis _meaning delays in increases could be that long _ credit cardinterest can change very quickly.   In addition, home mortgage debt is actually an investment in thesense that increases in home prices might entirely offset any risein interest costs.   Most credit card debt offers no such offset; generally, it isused to pay for items that have been completedly consumed, such asvacations, or for items of eroding rather than increasing valuue.   And, of course, Uncle Sam's tax code does very little to helpcredit card users adjust to the higher costs.   Until 1986, all credit card interest constituted a deduction onfederal income tax returns. The Tax Act of 1986 cut that to 65percent in 1987 and 40 percent this year. The percentage falls to20 in 1989, and 10 in 1990.   Because of its relatively low interest rate and fulltax-deductibility, home mortgage debt remains the only tax shelteravailable to most people, and it is an enormous one.   So great is it, and so much of a departure from the treatmentafforded other debt, that real estate and housing people areconvinced an attack on it will be launched in Congress next year.   Meanwhile, statistical evidence suggests Americans are veryaware of the friendly treatment accorded housing debt. Despiteinterest rates edging higher, sales of existing homes in June rosefor the fifth straight month.   The latest interest rate increases, to 6.5 percent for theFederal Reserve discount rate and 10 percent on the prime lendingrate, may eventually take a toll on home sales and housing starts.But even this is not a certainty.   In their August analysis, for example, economists of theNational Association of Realtors said expected rises in interestrates might encourage many potential homebuyers to purchase homeearlier than they had planned.   Such a phenomenon would not be new; in the 1970s, many couplesbought houses earlier than they had planned in order to beat risingprices. And the same behavior has long been observed in automobilemarkets.   Besides, there is a fair chance that higher interest ratesmight, in the long run, be offset entirely by increases in themarket value of the house that is purchased with the debt. Whatcould be more comforting than that?   Or, on the other hand, what could be more distressing than topay increasing rates of interest for goods or services whose valueis declining or already used up?   That is the situation in which credit card borrowers might findthemselves.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday Aug. 18</NOTE></DOC>
