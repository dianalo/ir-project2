Luo Guozhen of the State Environmental Protection Bureau saidChina needs stricter measures for handling nuclear waste and otherradioactive materials, the official China Daily reported.   Luo did not say how many accidents occurred from 1980 to 1985,and he did not give details of those that did occur, according tothe report.   Ignorance about the dangers of nuclear materials, and managerswho ignored regulations on handling radioactive waste, causedradiation leaks in recent years, the newspaper said.   It was China's first report on deaths caused by radioactivity.   China previously has disclosed that nuclear accidents hadoccurred, but it did not acknowledge they had caused severeradiation sickness or deaths.   There are no nuclear power plants in operation in China,although two are under construction. Most of China's nuclear wasteso far has been generated by the military, but growing amounts arebeing produced in laboratories, hospitals and non-militaryindustries.   Some of the accidents resulted from workers stealing containersused to hold radioactive materials.   In December, a carpenter at an electric equipment plant incoastal Jiangsu province stole a lead container used to hold cobalt60, the report said.   No deaths or injuries have been reported in that case, it said.   In February, the newspaper reported some uranium had been lostfrom a factory, exposing 15 people to radiation.   In 1986, an article by Zhou Zhumou of the Ministry of NuclearIndustry's Bureau of Safety, Protection and Health said anunspecified number of people were exposed to radiation when China'snuclear industry started up in the mid-1950s.   During the tumultuous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, whenscientists and technology were ridiculed in political campaigns, aserious accident took place at a production reactor in northwesternChina, Zhou said.   About 10 people were exposed to radiation in that accident andanother man got uranium poisoning in 1973, but there were no casesof acute radiation sickness, he said.   The Soviet Union has reported 31 deaths from the 1986 Chernobylnuclear accident.   In the United States, One man died in an accident in 1986 at theKerr-McGee atomic plant in Oklahama, and three people were killedby radiation at an experimental reactor in Idaho in 1961.   Saturday's report says China plans to build nuclear wastestorage facilities to handle the growing volume of radioactivewaste produced by about 1,000 industries and research labs.   The scheduled start-up of the Qinshan nuclear power plant incoastal Zhejiang province next December and of the Daya Bay plantin southeast Guangdong province in October 1992 will mean asubstantial increase in China's production of nuclear waste.   In the past, China stored radioactive waste in concrete basementfacilities designed to protect the materials for only 10 years,according to Pan Ziqiang of the China National Nuclear IndustryCorp.   Luo said waste storage facilities now have been built in 12provinces and are planned for eight others. He did not describe thefacilities.</TEXT></DOC>
