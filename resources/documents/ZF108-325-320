said RonCrellin, director of the Information Management and Technology AssessmentService in the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA).andM;&quot;We've had so many problems with these old proprietary systems that we can'thook anything to.&quot;andM;Members of Congress frequently pass on constituent complaints to the VA aboutdelayed and problem-plagued veterans' benefit payments.andP;  Now the department'sinformation resources management officials have almost completed plans tomodernize, decentralize and open up their financial and benefits processing.andM;After five years of preparation that began in 1985, the department this fallwill release a request for information for the first phase of a three-part,$220 million procurement known as the VBA Modernization Plan, for whichCrellin will be the trail boss.andP;  Officials expect equipment installation tobegin in fiscal 1992.andM;Crellin is the first trail boss designated by the General ServicesAdministration for a VA program.andP;  GSA has approved a delegation ofprocurement authority for the plan's Stage 1 and has agreed to amend the DPAfor stages 2 and 3.andM;For some time to come, the department will have to fine-tune its mix of openand proprietary systems.andP;  Crellin called the open systems on the market todaytechnologically inferior to proprietary systems because they lack thefunctions and processing efficiencies the VA needs.andM;Each month, VBA must provide the data to cut thousands of checks to veterans'beneficiaries or their survivors for compensation, pensions, education, homeloans and insurance benefits.andP;  VBA also supplies data and statistics to thedepartment's financial and accounting information systems.andM;Some 2.5 million veterans and survivors receive continuing compensation,valued at $11.3 billion for fiscal 1989.andP;  Another 1.2 million get pensionsestimated at $3.9 billion.andP;  Education and training payments worth $572million go to more than 250,000 veterans and their survivors.andP;  Home loans,valued at $152 million, amount to 4 million.andP;  And the VA holds 7 millioninsurance policies worth $204 billion.andM;These obligations demand extreme efficiency in processing, Crellin said.andM;&quot;We must return again and again to our mission,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If those checksaren't cut, veterans will write their congressmen and march in the streets.&quot;andM;The VBA Modernization Plan will combine open systems characteristics withproprietary ones.andM;&quot;What you really need is an open system running under a proprietary protocolor vice versa,&quot; Crellin said.andP;  &quot;In the short run as people are moving towardopen architectures, you have to live in both worlds.&quot;andM;But by stressing open architecture, officials believe they are positioningthe department for the future rather than locking it into a dead end.andP;  Theirexisting equipment, mostly installed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, hasoffered them few alternatives for change.andM;Although the benefits processing work, much of it manual, is done by VAemployees in the 58 regional offices, the systems that support these programsare centralized in the VA's three mainframe processing centers.andM;The compensation, pension and education records are housed on Honeywell Inc.andO;DPS 870 dual mainframes.andP;  There are three at the Hines, Ill., center, one inAustin, Texas, and one in Philadelphia.andP;  One of the dual systems at Hinesholds the master file.andM;These machines use an old proprietary protocol customized for the VA byHoneywell Inc. in the 1970s.andP;  Crellin said the 870s are at capacity.andP;  Thelife insurance records and their master file are on an old IBM Corp.andP;  Model370/168 mainframes in Philadelphia emulating even older IBM equipment.andM;&quot;That's one of the few left running in the country, I'm sure,&quot; Crellin said.andM;The programming is in an almost vanished language, Autocoder.andP;  For severalyears, the VA has been converting it to COBOL; Crellin said the changeoverwill be finished this year.andM;Centralization is another problem.andP;  The 11,000 VA employees in regionaloffices now can gain access to benefits records only on 3,000 dumb terminals.andO;They are forced to process much of the benefits and financial informationmanually, Crellin said.andM;VBA's modernization strategy calls for giving the regional offices extensivecomputer tools, such as off-the-shelf database management system packages.andO;During the first phase of the procurement, Crellin said, about 10,000workstations will go into the field.andM;&quot;What we have in place now has been highly centralized since it wasinstalled, and that's what we're trying to get away from,&quot; Crellin said.andP;  &quot;Tothe extent possible, we're going to decentralize to the regional offices.&quot;andM;Existing systems also limit access to information from separate records.andP;  Norare the benefits systems connected with the VA's Decentralized HospitalComputer Program.andM;However, the modernization will integrate all veterans data sources, Crellinsaid.andM;Although Phase 1 emphasizes getting the regional offices on line, Phase 2will bring in local area networks and specialized peripherals.andP;  In the finalphase, the procurement will concentrate on mainframe upgrades.andM;&quot;We're timing each of the stages about a year apart,&quot; Crellin said.andM;Although VA officials are pushing for decentralization of benefitsprocessing, Crellin said, the financial management systems and a recordslocator system will remain centralized on mainframes at the Austin processingcenter.andM;At the beginning of Phase 3, the VA will replicate the data now in theaccounting information systems and the Benefits Identification RecordsLocation System.andP;  Upgrades to these systems will wait until the last phasebecause officials expect to supplement this data with much information now onpaper in the regional offices.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
