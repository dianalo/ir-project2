Andever since the fourth quarter of last year, investors haveshrunk back from the shares.   Analysts watched in horror as a price war unfolded withAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph. The game on the Street becameforecasting MCI's market share, quarter by quarter. And nodoubt, there are analysts with a bead on exactly what shareof long-distance volume MCI stands to grab at any hour of dayon the south side of Philadelphia.</LP><TEXT>   What they are missing is that MCI remains what it hasalways been: a growth stock. In the first half of 1991, itgot back its lost market share and then some. And, to borrowa metaphor, if the stock is viewed as a long-distanceinvestment, Washington-based MCI remains a fast growing,shrewdly managed carrier in a business that continues toexpand during a service-economy slump.   &quot;If you don't get caught up in the latest rate case, thegrowth in long distance is tremendous,&quot; notes John Shapiro,principal in Chieftain Capital Management. &quot;It has only twomain competitors,&quot; he says, and only one, ATandamp;T, that matters.Moreover, he adds, &quot;There are barriers to entry; MCI ismaking more than 20% on equity, and it is benefiting fromtechnology, so adding new capacity is very cheap.&quot;   Yet MCI's shares, even having rebounded sharply from thisyear's low of 18, closed yesterday at only 28 1/2. The stockthus trades at 13 times estimated 1991 per-share earnings,and 10 or 11 times the estimates for 1992.   That is the sort of multiple associated with weakcompanies, or weak industries. But since the end of theKorean War, the long-distance business has grown, in terms ofminutes, at about an 8-percentage-point faster clip than theoverall economy. In a robust year, that means 12% volumegrowth. In a recession year like this one, volume is stillgrowing at 6% to 8%.   Some of that growth reflects technological changes, suchas facsimile machines. Some is a result of fallinglong-distance rates. &quot;But if you step back,&quot; says GregorySawers, of Sanford C. Bernstein, &quot;the last time the industrygrew at less than 5% was the Korean War. The last time it hadnegative growth was in the Great Depression. It may vary fromquarter to quarter, but over some long period there isclearly a change in the way society lives and works.&quot;   And that change continues. Each time a credit-cardpurchase is verified; each time a store with centralizedinventory records a sale; each time an out-of-town travelerwithdraws money from an automatic teller, it is thelong-distance equivalent of dropping a coin in the slot.   And revenue from overseas is poised to grow, perhapssharply. Spurred by the Gulf War, the highly profitablyinternational traffic accounted for 20%-and-up of MCI'sresidential revenue in the first quarter. Like other U.S.long distance carriers, MCI collects a fee from overseas forincoming international calls. But at present, Mr. Sawerssays, traffic into the U.S. is only about half of outgoingtraffic. Either Americans have big mouths, or messages arepiling up unreturned from Rome to Rio. Whichever, as phonecompanies privatize, overseas rates -- much higher than U.S.rates -- are dropping. That should spur more calls to theU.S.   At home, MCI's wide array of marketing programs havereinforced its gains in U.S. market share, to about 15%today, according to analysts. One plus in the marketing warsis that MCI's billing system is flexible, while ATandamp;T's issomewhat tied to that of local operators, analysts say.Another is that, with fewer customers to lose, MCI canpromote more aggressively. Also, in the Street's view, MCIdelivers roughly equivalent service while undercharging ATandamp;Tby what analysts say is around 5%, leaving it room foreventual price improvement.   The bear case, Mr. Sawers of Sanford C. Bernstein notes,is that ATandamp;T will, via price cutting, &quot;make life miserablefor itself and others.&quot; But ATandamp;T is doing well in longdistance, and as it struggles to absorb its acquisition ofNCR, it will have every reason not to upset long distance.What's more, there is evidence that the price war has alreadyabated. MCI Chief Financial Officer Gene Gabbard says pricesfell 6% in 1990 and 1% in the 1991 first quarter. But in therecent quarter, he says, revenue rose by 3.6% and averageprices eked out a small gain. &quot;The ugly part was last year,&quot;he says.   Since the 1984 Bell System breakup, prices have dropped byabout 45% -- meaning that carriers have given back half theirvolume gains. Chieftain's Mr. Shapiro sees that patterngiving way to a new era in which the two lead carriers,acting as &quot;a sort of benign oligopoly, raise rates. When thatday comes, returns are enormous.&quot;   ---   MCI Communications   (OTC; Symbol: MCIC)                                                                                                          Business: Long distance telecommunications                                                                                                          Year ended Dec. 31, 1990:   Revenue: $7.68 billion   Net Income: $299 million*; $1.06 a share                                                                                                          Second quarter, June 30, 1991:   Per-share earnings: 50 cents vs. 67 cents                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume: 1,135,146 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 260 million                                                                                                          *Reflects $550 million charge related to write-down ofassets.</TEXT></DOC>
