Introduction</ITAG>A. Statutory AuthorityThe proposed deletion is issued under sections 313(d) and (e)(1) of TitleIII of SARA (Pub. L. 99-499). Title II of SARA is also referred to as theEmergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986.B. BackgroundSection 313 of SARA Title III requires certain facilities using toxic chemicalsto report annual thir environmental releases of such chemicals. Section313 establishes an initial list of toxic chemicals that is composed ormore than 300 chemicals and chemical categories. Any person may petitionEPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list.EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provideguidance regarding the recommended content and format for submitting petitions.EPA must respond to petitions within 180 days either by initiating a rulemakingor by publishing an explanation of why the petiton is denied.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of Petition</ITAG>On September 30, 1988, EPA received a petition form the Aluminum Associationto delete aluminum oxide (A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>) from the list of toxic chemicals. All forms of aluminum oxide(fibrous and nonfibrous) are currently listed under section 313. On February9, 1989, a two-week extension of the review period was granted to allowEPA to address additional concerns. The satutory deadline for EPA's responseis April 12, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. EPA's Review of Aluminum Oxide</ITAG>A Toxicity Evaluation The health and environmental review of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> include the assessment of metabolism and absorption, acute toxicity,chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, developmental effects,neurotoxic effects, reproductive system toxicity, and environmental toxicity.All readily available data, including those provided in the petition, studiesretrieved from literature searches, and documents prepared by EPA, wereconsidered in the health and environmental assessment. Studies in whichalunimum power was the test chemical were also evaluated because aluminumpowder is rapidly oxidized to A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>. 1. <T3>Acute toxicity. </T3>Based on available data and physicochemical properties,A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> is not expected to be toxic upon acute or short-term exposure.2. <T3>Chronic toxicity. </T3>The combined weight of evidence from human andanimal studies indicates that A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> has weak fibrogenic potential. When humans and animals wereexposed by inhalation to A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> or to A1 powder, severe or irreversible pulmonary disease wasnot observed.Although some pulmonary fibrosis has been observed in studies of workersexposed to aluminum dust and A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> powder in occupational settings, the effect has been attributedto extremely high exposures and to other components mixed with A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>, such as silica.3. <T3>Carcinogenicity (nonfibrous A1</T3><T2>2</T2><T3>O</T3><T2>3</T2>). Nonfibrous forms of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans.This finding is based on the lack of a tumorogenic response in three assaysof nonfibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> in rats and hamsters by three routes of administration (intratracheal,intramuscular, and intrapleural). There is no evidence in humans that nonfibrousA1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> is involved in tumor development as a result of usual environmentalroutes of exposure.4. <T3>Carcinogenicity (fibrous A1</T3><T2>2</T2><T3>O</T3><T2>3</T2>). In light of a positive intrapleural implantation study withrespirable A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> fibers in rats, EPA has identified a cancer concern for humansexposed to respirable A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> fibers (i.e., fibers with a diameter up to 3.5 um and lengthsup to about 200 um).In 72 experiments, researchers implanted mineral particles of respirablesize and of wide chemical and structural varieties into the pleurae offemale Osborne-Mendel rats. Eight samples of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> were included, seven of which were fibrous. A 40 mg dose ofparticles dispersed in gelatin was applied by open thoracotomy to the leftpleural surface.In each experiment, 30 to 50 rats were treated and followed for two years.All rats were necropsied and all lesions examined histologically. Threeof the seven fibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> samples produced a statistically significant (30% or greater)incidence of pleural sarcomas. Because inhalation studies in rodents may not be adequately sensitive forevaluating the carcinogenic potential of fibrous materials in humans, intrapleural,intratracheal and intraperitoneal routes of administration are frequentlyused. While these methods may not necessarily be predictive of cancer hazardvia inhalation, they are of value in determining the intrinsic carcinogenicactivity of test fibers close to or in contact with the target tissues.EPA was not able to identify an adequate inhalation bioassay performedwith respirable A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> fibers to either support or call into question the findingsof the intrapleural study discussed above.A Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) submitted by a manufacturer of SaffilA1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> fibers appears to contradict EPA's finding of a cancer concern.According to the MSDS, lifetime rat inhalation studies of Saffil fibersat the maximum concentration achievable showed no evidence of lung cancer,lung fibrosis, or any other adverse effect, apart from a minimal pulmonaryresponse typical of that of a nuisance particulate. However, EPA reviewedan inhalation study believed to be among those used as the basis for theMSDS's summary statements and found that the lack of a positive responsewas probably because the tested fibers were relatively thick and containeda low level of respirable fractions and because the exposure concentrationsof the fibers were low.The MSDS also reports that studies in which Saffil fiber was administeredby the intraperitoneal, intratracheal, or intrapleural route, togetherwith two in vitro tests, did not show positive results, while chrysotileasbestos and crystalline silica used as positive controls did. EPA reviewedtwo intraperitoneal studies presumed to be among those used for the MSDSand found them inadequate for carcinogenicity assessment of the fibersbecause of the short study durations (observation periods of 6 months to1 year).5. <T3>Neurotoxicity. </T3>Although aluminum has been implicated in Alzheimer'sdisease as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ALS-parkinsonismdementia, EPA found no clear evidence that it has a role in the observedpathological changes, signs, and symptoms of any of these diseases. Aluminumhas not been found to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease in severalcase-control studies.This effect is addressed here because Al presented to biological systemsas A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> may react with stomach acid and lead to Al ion formation. 6. <T3>Developmental toxicity. </T3>Available information is not sufficientfor determining whether A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> is a developmental toxicant.7. <T3>Mutagenicity and reproductive system toxicity. </T3>There is no informationavailable for evaluating A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>'s potential to cause heritable genetic mutations in humans orharmful reproductive system effects.8. <T3>Ecotoxicity. </T3>Because of its low water solubility, A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> is not expected to cause any significant toxicity toward aquaticspecies at normal pH values (6-9), where A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> can be expected to precipitate and mix with sediments.Under more acidic conditions (pH less than 5), the solubility of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> increases, and A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> found naturally in soils or deposited from industrial emissionsmay be mobilized as polymeric complexes. In susceptible aquatic systems,these complexes may cause toxicity to aquatic life. However, it is difficultto distinguish between the effects of the aluminum compounds and thosedue to low pH.A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> is not expected to bioaccumulate significantly.B. Production, Release, and Exposure1. <T3>Production and use. </T3>In 1987, domestic production of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> was 9.13 billion pounds. Approximately 8 billion pounds of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> was imported in 1987, while exports were negligible.Most A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> produced (94 percent) is used in the manufacturing of aluminummetal. The remaining A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> is used to manufacture specialty aluminas such as aluminum hydroxides,activated aluminas and calcined alumina, which can be processed into fiberform.There are three domestic producers of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>: the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa), Kaiser Aluminum andChemical Corporation, and Reynolds Metals Company.There are currently two known manufacturers (3M Inc. and DuPont) and oneknown importer (ICI Americas Inc.) of fibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>. Production and import volumes for fibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> products are unknown or claimed confidential by the producers,but the combined total is expected to be less than .5 percent of all A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> production. No reports were found in the Toxic Release Inventorydatabase for releases of fibrous aluminum oxide from the facilities ofthese known manufacturers and importer.2. <T3>Exposure and release. </T3>To date, 1,197 release reports have beenreceived for A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> under section 313. EPA examined aproximately twenty of thesereports for release information. While the reports do not distinguish betweennonfibrous and fibrous forms of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>, EPA believes, based on knowledge of the facilities involved,that all of the examined reports were for releases of nonfibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>. Among the reports examined, fugitive air emissions of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> per facility ranged from 33,000 to 8.4 million pounds per year.Stack air emissions per facility ranged from 390,000 to 1.7 million poundsper year. Releases to landfill were reported as high as 350 million pounds per facilityper year. While this release appears high, A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> is not expected to leach into drinking water supplies due toits low water solubility. The largest release to water identified was 32 million pounds per year.Due to the low water solubility, the density, and the particle size ofA1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>, releases to water are anticipated to result in precipitationto sediments. Currently, little data are available to assess the release and exposurescenarios of fibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>. EPA was not able to identify any release reports for fibrousA1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>. Retaining fibrous forms of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> on the section 313 list will allow collection and evaluationof this needed release and exposure information. C. Summary of the Technical Review EPA's health and environmental review of nonfibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> yielded no evidence of significant adverse human health or environmentaleffects. Evidence exists to support the finding that exposures to the fibrous formof A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> may lead to the development of cancer in humans. This effectappears to be attributable more to the fibrous nature of the material thanto the chemical properties of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>, since there is no evidence that nonfibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> causes cancer. Currently, little data are available to assess the release and exposurescenarious of fibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>. While production and importation volumes are expected to beless than .5 percent of all A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> production, actual figures are unknown or have been claimedconfidential. It is not known if release reports have been received orfibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>, since the reports do not distinguish between fibrous and nonfibrousforms. Focusing reporting on fibrous forms of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> will clarify annual release and exposure numbers for fibrousA1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Explanation for Proposed Action to Delete </ITAG>EPA is partially granting the petition submitted by the Aluminum Associationby proposing to delete nonfibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> from the section 313 list of toxic chemicals. The decision to delete nonfibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> from the list is based upon EPA's toxicity evaluation. EPA believesthat there is no evidence that nonfibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> is known to cause or can reasonably be expected to cause healthor environmental effects as described in section 313(d)(2). The decision to retain fibrous forms of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> on the list is also based upon EPA's toxicity evaluation. EPAbelieves that there is evidence that inhalation exposures to fibrous formsof A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Rulemaking Record </ITAG>The record supporting this proposed rule is contained in docket controlnumber OPTS-400029. All documents, including an index of the docket, areavailable to the public in the TSCA Public Docket Office from 8 a.m. to4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. The TSCA PublicDocket Office is located at EPA Headquarters, Rm. NE-G004, 401 M St., SW.,Washington, DC 20460. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Request for Public Comment </ITAG>The Agency requests comments on all the analyses conducted for this reviewand on the Agency's proposal to delete nonfibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> from the list of toxic chemicals. EPA also requests that anypertinent data of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> be submitted to the address at the front of this document. Scientific evidence suggests that carcinogenicity concerns may exist fora variety of fibrous materials in addition to fibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>. EPA intends to explore the need for adding to the section 313list a category of ``respirable fibers'' to include fibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> and other fibers of concern. This will build upon ongoing EPAwork in respirable fibers and fine particulates, including that being conductedthrough EPA's Offices of Toxic Substances, Research and Development, andAir and Radiation. EPA therefore requests public comment on the need for and feasibility ofadding to the list a ``respirable fibers'' category. Public comment shouldaddress: definition of the category; criteria for inclusion of materialstherein; considerations such as durability, respirability, and dimensionsof fibers; feasibility of measuring or estimating respirable fractionsof emissions of fibrous materials; or any other consideration relevantto the establishment of such a category. All comments related to the deletion of nonfibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> must be submitted on or before June 23, 1989. All comments relatedto the addition of a new category of ``respirable fibers'' to the section313 list must be submitted on or before August 22, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore, requires a Regulatory Impact Analysis. EPA has determinedthat this proposed rule is not a ``major rule'' because it will not havean effect on the economy of $100 billion or more. This proposed rule would decrease the impact of the section 313 reportingrequirements on coverd facilities and would result in cost-savings to industry,EPA, and States. Therefore, this is a minor rule under Executive Order12291. This proposed rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) under Executive Order 12291. The total number of reports expected for all forms of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> is 1,171. Based on this estimate, the cost savings of delistingfor industry of delisting all forms of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> over a 10-year period is estimated to be up to $12,230,000,while the savings for EPA are estimated to be up to $231,000 (10-year presentvalues using a 10 percent discount rate). At this time, not enough is known about A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> fibers to estimate the costs of reporting their releases separately.However, given that fibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> is expected to represent less than .5 percent of all A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> production, the cost savings for delisting only nonfibrous A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> should not be significantly less than the cost savings for delistingall forms of A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Agency must conduct asmall business analysis to determine whether a substantial number of smallentities will be significantly affected. Because the proposed rule resultsin cost savings to facilities, the Agency certifies that small entitieswill not be significantly affected by the rule. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule does not have any information collection requirementsunder the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C.3501 et seq. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 372 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Community right-to-know, Environmental protection, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Toxic chemicals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 12, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Victor J.
