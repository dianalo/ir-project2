At the sametime, the military was also right that when force must beused it should be used overwhelmingly; this traditionalmilitary doctrine seems all the more pressing after the longagony of Vietnam.   Squaring these two priorities is not easy, but the newStealth aircraft and precision munitions made it possible todevastate military targets while sparing citizens alongside.The limitation of collateral damage is surely to beencouraged. It emphasizes the differences between us and theSaddams of the world, who park their jets in residentialneighborhoods and crush rebellion with wanton massacres. Careover civilians also ensures that domestic support will beforthcoming when the use of force is necessary. And finally,a decent respect for civilians minimizes the usual bitterlegacy of wars and makes it easier to build toward a peacemore likely to last.</LP><TEXT>   In this respect, a couple of points are worth reflection.In one of the great steps toward protecting civilians inwartime, at the end of World War II the U.S. chartered aneffort known as the strategic bombing assessment. Reviewingthe massive raids on German and Japanese cities, it foundthat war production continued pretty much as usual. Levelingof cities had little or no military value. It might now be agood idea to gather another group of civilians and Pentagonplanners to again look at whether military purposes wereserved by the destruction of Iraq's infrastructure, withcivilian effects a U.N. team described as &quot;near apocalyptic.&quot;   In particular, a study ought to look at the attacks thatdestroyed the Iraqi electrical-power grid. It is the lack ofgenerating capacity to power such fundamental structures aswater-pumping stations and sewage facilities that is causingthe stark assessments of life now for civilian Iraqis. Theattacks were of course intended to disrupt Saddam's commandand control systems, but we can assume that unlike civilianfacilities, these were equipped with power backups. The poweroutage will of course also set back Saddam's strategicprograms, though here too power can be restored more quicklythan to civilian areas. Given the hardship imposed, thereought to be some hardheaded assessment of the extent to whichmilitary purposes were served.   That being said, the conduct of the war did one even worsething to Iraqi civilians. To wit, stopping with Saddam stillin power while his armies were in rout. The factionalfighting now producing such gruesome reports could have beenavoided if coalition forces had simply proceeded to destroythe rest of the Iraqi military and sought to establisheffective control over the entire country, instead ofstopping in southern Iraq. Already this has led to the deathof many innocent Iraqis who would have been available to helpbuild a non-Baathist Iraq.   The best way to build peace in the Middle East would be toshow civilians in the region there is a way to a better life.That is, that there is an alternative to the nihilism thathas animated politics for so many of the region's people.However understandable it is for Kuwaitis to seek revenge onPalestinians who cheered Saddam, this does not advance thecause of peace. Neither does a civil war in Iraq. Especiallynot if Saddam preserves his internal power through massivebrutality, with the potential of renewed oil revenues torebuild nuclear and chemical facilities while playing to mobswith anti-Western resentments.   A new world order would be easier to build, it somehowseems to us, if the war planners had taken out thetroublemaker and left the country's power plants alone.Trying to organize a new Iraq, of course, would be afrustrating and chancy task. The attempt, however, wouldserve as recognition that just as the U.S. was able toidentify the changed requirements of modern warfare, it isalso able to recognize the evolving order of world politics-- away from one-man rule and toward a more representativeand more pluralistic politics. An American effort to giveIraq a real chance at a civil political order would be theultimate sign of respect for the welfare of civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
