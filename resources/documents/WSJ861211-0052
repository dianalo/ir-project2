She said Canada's proposal is &quot;still on the table as a basis for further discussion.&quot;    A spokesman for the U.S. Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports, a U.S. industry group, said the negotiators were making headway yesterday in their first day of talks. U.S. lumber industry sources said in Washington that U.S. negotiators had proposed that Canada impose a 40% surtax on its softwood lumber exports to the U.S., to offset what the U.S. calls subsidies to those producers. The sources, who said they were briefed by U.S. officials, said Canadian negotiators offered a 15% surtax.    The two governments decided to try to negotiate a settlement after the U.S. Commerce Department's preliminary finding of Oct. 16. The department said that Canadian softwood lumber exports ought to be subject to import duties of about 15% to offset the subsidies. Canada late last month offered to impose a 15% surtax on those exports to avoid the duties.    The negotiations are being held under a procedure that enables the U.S. lumber industry effectively to veto any settlement that it doesn't consider adequate. Spokesmen for the industry have said any surtax should be at least 25%. If the talks produce an agreement that American sawmill owners find satisfactory, they would withdraw their petition for U.S. duties on the Canadian lumber. If the talks break down, the petition would stand and the U.S. would proceed with the duties.    Miss Carney said U.S. and Canadian negotiators will meet again in Washington next week. Despite the negotiations, Miss Carney said Canada was &quot;vigorously&quot; pursuing its complaint over the lumber dispute with a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. She said a GATT panel is to resume its hearings on the matter Friday in Geneva, Switzerland.    Canada claims that the Commerce Department ruling is &quot;unjustifiable trade harassment&quot; because an earlier Commerce Department inquiry in 1983 cleared Canada of subsidy charges. The U.S. imported $2.87 billion (U.S.) of Canadian softwood lumber last year, about a third of U.S. supplies.    A U.S. industry source said the two governments agreed that any Canadian export tax on lumber eventually would be superseded by increases in the stumpage fees that the Canadian lumber industry pays provincial governments for standing timber.    The Canadian Forest Industries Council, which represents major Canadian softwood lumber producers, is opposed to the Canadian efforts to negotiate an export tax. A.H. Zimmerman, chairman of the council and president of Noranda Inc., said the industry can't afford such a measure. </TEXT></DOC>
