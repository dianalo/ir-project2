A 1990 court decision affecting many West Coast companiesspurred the lawsuit, and attorneys say other suits couldfollow challenging pay penalties for salaried employees.</LP><TEXT>   The plaintiffs in the latest case seek class-action statuson behalf of other salaried employees of General Dynamics.   Albert N. Sena and Terrance O. Malady were classified byGeneral Dynamics as salaried employees. As such, they fit thedefinition of &quot;bona fide executives&quot; under the provisions ofthe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and were exempt from thefederal law's protections for hourly workers, according tothe suit filed in federal court in San Diego.   But &quot;bona fide executives&quot; must be paid on a salary -- notan hourly -- basis. General Dynamics' policy of dockingworkers is &quot;completely antithetical to the concept of asalaried employee,&quot; the suit alleges.   The suit cites as precedent the Ninth Circuit U.S. Courtof Appeals' 1990 decision in Abshire vs. County of Kern,which found that the Kern County Fire Department violated theexemption for &quot;bona fide executives&quot; when it docked batallionchiefs for missed work.   &quot;What Abshire says is if you {dock salaried employees},then the employees are no longer exempt from the Act,&quot; saidS. Myron Klarfeld, the San Diego attorney for Messrs. Senaand Malady. If the court decides that the class is entitledto unpaid overtime, St. Louis-based General Dynamics could beordered to shell out as much as $50 million to $150 million,Mr. Klarfeld estimates.   &quot;Certainly, if an employer has been treating employees asexempt for some period of time and hasn't been payingovertime, and the employees are found not to be exempt, youcould be talking about a large amount of money in back pay,&quot;observes Mark Dichter, an attorney specializing in labor lawwith the Philadelphia law firm Morgan, Lewis andamp; Bockius.   General Dynamics officials declined to immediately commenton the suit.   ---   SOUTHMARK CAN SEEK at least $26 million fromex-executives, court rules.   Southmark sued its former chairman, Gene E. Phillips, itsformer vice chairman, William S. Friedman, and companies theycontrolled last year, alleging they walked away with $84million more than they should have under the terms of two1989 agreements severing the relationship between theexecutives and the company.   Although the ruling greatly reduced the amount Southmarkcan try to recover from the two executives, every little bitwould help the real-estate company. After a trip throughChapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, the formerhighflier is liquidating its assets to repay about $2 billionin creditor claims. By some estimates, creditors are expectedto receive less than $200 million, or less than 10 cents onthe dollar, barring successful litigation to recoveradditional funds.   But before the company can recover anything from Messrs.Phillips and Friedman, it must prove that the assets werefraudulently conveyed or were preference transfers underbankruptcy laws. A trial on those issues is scheduled forSeptember.   In his decision, Judge Steven A. Felsenthal found that Mr.Phillips and Mr. Friedman received $16.3 million under theterms of a January 1989 agreement, but that Southmark didn'treceive any real assets in return.   The judge also ruled that, under a July 1989 agreement,the men received about $1.9 million and American RealtyTrust, a real estate trust they control, received about $68.9million in stock and other assets from Southmark.   Southmark, the judge decided, received about $61 millionin mortgages and a release from a guarantee from AmericanRealty Trust.   If the judge later finds that $17 million in mortgagesshould not have been initially transferred to AmericanRealty, Southmark may be permitted to seek $43 millioninstead of $26 million from the men and their company.   A Southmark lawyer declined comment on the ruling. Aspokeswoman for the executives and American Realty said theruling comes too early in the litigation to comment. But shesaid American Realty is gratified that the judge found onlyan approximately $8 million difference in what Southmarktransferred to American Realty and what American Realtyreceived.   Separately, Southmark said that an Arizona federal judgeruled that two subsidiaries of the former Lincoln Savings andamp;Loan Association are entitled to $49.5 million, plusinterest, in loans they had made to a Southmark subsidiarynot involved in the bankruptcy-law filing. Southmark hadhoped to recover most of that amount, now held in escrow,arguing that the funds should have been treated as unsecureddebt in the Chapter 11 proceedings.   Southmark said it would appeal the Arizona ruling.   ---   CHILD CAN SUE for emotional losses due to father's injury,court rules.   Many states allow spouses to make claims for so-calledloss of consortium, which involves intangibles such as a lossof companionship or affection, but courts have only recentlyextended such rights to children when a parent is seriouslyinjured. Nine states, including Texas, West Virginia, andWyoming, have endorsed suits brought on behalf of children.   This Massachusetts case is unusual because it is the firsttime the state's highest court has issued a ruling in a casein which the child was not yet born at the time of hisfather's injury. Earlier this year, a jury in state court inSpringfield, Mass., awarded a child $50,000 for his emotionallosses in a similar case.   In the case decided by the Massachusetts Supreme JudicialCourt in Boston this week, Leo LePage, the child's father,suffered permanent brain damage in 1985 when a car in whichhe was a passenger hit a light pole. After the accident, Mr.LePage and the child filed suit against the Swansea, Mass.,restaurant where the driver was served alcohol.   A lower court dismissed the child's suit, ruling thatbecause the child could not have survived outside the womb atthe time of the accident, he was not entitled to recover anydamages for his emotional losses.   The state's high court overturned that ruling andreinstated the child's case. The court ruled that the childhas a right to sue because he was conceived prior to hisfather's injury. Ruling otherwise would have beeninconsistent, the court noted, since under state law thechild would have been permitted to sue if his father had diedin the accident.   Lawyers for the restaurant could not be reached forcomment.   Alan A. Amaral, a Somerset, Mass., lawyer for the child,said the decision may affect the national debate aboutabortion. &quot;The court here has ruled that a child's viabilityis not a standard by which to measure the right to sue. Byextension, other courts may rule that it is alsoinappropriate to use it as a measure of when to abort,&quot; Mr.Amaral said.   ---   NOTED: Peter Hearn, former chancellor of the PhiladelphiaBar Association and a recent unsuccessful mayoral candidate,is rejoining his former law firm, Pepper, Hamilton andamp; Scheetz,as a partner. Mr. Hearn, a specialist in civil litigation andgovernment relations, lost the Democratic primary inPhiladelphia last May to Edward G. Rendell, a former districtattorney and a partner at the Philadelphia law firm ofMesirov, Gelman, Jaffe, Cramer andamp; Jamieson.</TEXT></DOC>
