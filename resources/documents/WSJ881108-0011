Rates on new short-term Treasury bills sold by the government yesterday surged to their highest levels in nearly 3 1/2 years. The average rate on new 13-week bills rose to 7.54% from 7.37% a week ago.    In the bond market, prices of long-term Treasury issues fell more than half a point, or over $5 for each $1,000 face amount. That brought their decline since last Thursday to about 2 1/2 points. Municipal bonds also fell, while corporate and mortgage-backed bonds finished flat to down slightly.    The slump began early Friday after a government report showed unexpectedly strong increases in business hiring last month. That rekindled inflation fears and demolished hopes that the Federal Reserve might reduce interest rates soon. Instead, some analysts now expect the Fed to tighten credit a little more before year end in an effort to restrain inflation pressures -- no matter who wins the presidency.    The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds were quoted late in the day at 8.96%. That was up from 8.91% last Friday and 8.74% last Thursday.    Concern about the inflation outlook increased further because of a survey of corporate purchasing managers released yesterday. Much to the surprise of many analysts, the National Association of Purchasing Management's latest survey showed the economy surged last month, reversing a three-month decline. Purchasers also named 189 commodities that rose in price last month, while only three dropped in price.    &quot;The direction of rates is up,&quot; said Ian MacKinnon, bond manager at the Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa. He expects long-term Treasury bond yields to increase to the 9 1/2% to 10% level.    &quot;We certainly don't see the economy slowing down that much,&quot; he said. &quot;The people looking {for the Fed to} ease have to be looking at a different set of numbers than we are.&quot; Moreover, he added, &quot;If the economy shows the kind of numbers it showed on Friday, the next move {by the Fed} would be toward greater restraint.&quot;    The bond market's woes come as the Treasury begins its quarterly financing operation. The Treasury today will sell about $9.5 billion of new three-year notes, followed tomorrow by $9.5 billion of 10-year notes. Then on Thursday, the department will auction about $11 billion of 37-day cash management bills.    Treasury Securities   Rates on new short-term Treasury bills sold yesterday surged to their highest auction levels since May 1985.    The average rate on new three-month bills was 7.54%. On six-month bills, it was 7.71%.    Prices of long-term Treasury bonds finished near their lowest levels of the day. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds fell to 101 22/32 from 102 1/4 Friday and 104 3/32 last Thursday.    The government's latest 10-year notes declined to 102 5/32 from 102 19/32, while the yield climbed to 8.91% from 8.84%.    The new three-year notes to be auctioned today were quoted in when-issued trading late yesterday at 8.58%, up from 8.51% Friday and only 8.30% last Thursday. Some traders expect the average yield on the notes to be about 8.60% to 8.65%.    Many money managers continue to favor short-term issues because of the unusually narrow difference between short-term and long-term bond yields. The spread between the when-issued three-year and 10-year notes now stands at only about a third of a percentage point. That is down from an average of about three-quarters of a percentage point over the past 12 months, according to data compiled by Salomon Brothers Inc.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. fell 5.54 points to 1250.97. The low was 1250.31, while the high was 1254.95. The total return so far this year on the bonds in the index is 8.12%. That includes price changes as well as interest income.    Here are details of the Treasury bill auction:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                13-Week           26-Week   Applications ......... $24,517,995,000   $24,157,050,000   Accepted bids ........  $7,202,365,000    $7,225,300,000   Accepted at low price              57%               57%   Accepted noncompet'ly   $1,152,220,000      $984,880,000   Average price (Rate)    98.094 (7.54%)    96.102 (7.71%)   High price (Rate) ....  98.104 (7.50%)    96.117 (7.68%)   Low price (Rate) .....  98.092 (7.55%)    96.097 (7.72%)   Coupon equivalent ....           7.79%             8.13%   Both issues are dated Nov. 10. The 13-week bills mature Feb. 9, 1989, and the 26-week bills mature May 11, 1989.   Foreign Issues   A new Eurobond issue designed partly in response to investor skittishness toward conventional corporate offerings was launched yesterday.   Sandamp;S Finance International Inc., a unit of Stop andamp; Shop Cos., offered $200 million of Eurobonds secured by mortgages. The issue carries a guarantee by Financial Securities Assurance Inc., giving it a triple-A rating.   The structure of the Sandamp;S issue was seen in part as a response to investor concerns about U.S. corporate debt in the aftermath of the buy-out proposals for RJR Nabisco Inc. Stop andamp; Shop itself was the subject of a leveraged buy-out earlier this year and now is owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. The Eurobond issue will be used to pay bank debt arising from the buy-out.   The FSA guarantee gives the issue a higher credit rating than the borrower could command on its own. In effect, it is an assurance that the collateral, mortgages on properties valued at $332 million, merits the triple-A credit rating.   Sandamp;S Finance's bonds are due in December 1996, according to underwriters led by Bankers Trust International Ltd. A Bankers Trust official in New York said the bonds carry a coupon rate of 10 1/8%. They were priced to offer investors an annual yield of about 10.2%, he said.   In other major markets:   -- British government bonds, or gilts, ended slightly lower after a quiet session marked mainly by professional positioning. Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 were quoted late in the day at 117, down 7/32 of a point from late Friday, to yield 9.53%.   -- Japanese government bonds also declined slightly in very light trading. The government's benchmark No. 105, 5% issue due 1997 fell to 101.78, down 0.06 yen for each 100 yen face value from Saturday. The yield rose to 4.72% in the interdealer market, up one basis point from Saturday, and 4.5 basis points from Friday. The range on the session was 4.71% to 4.75%.   -- West German government bond prices slumped. Bonn's benchmark 6 3/4% issue of 1998 fell 0.40 point to 102.80 to yield 6.35%.   Mortgage-Backed Issues   Remics took center stage in the mortgage securities market as three big issues totaling more than $1.2 billion were offered and a $1 billion deal from Fannie Mae is due for pricing.   Remics, or real estate mortgage investment conduits, have proven increasingly popular with investors during the past few weeks amid concerns about corporate credit quality. Underwriters have rushed to meet the Remic demand, but they've been hampered to some degree by a scarcity of collateral.   The problem of getting sufficient collateral was underscored yesterday, when the cost of covering a short position in Fannie Mae 10% bonds for November delivery rose sharply, indicating a major shortage of the issue. The higher cost of covering a short position reflects heavy issuance of Remics using the Fannie Mae bonds and only a modest supply of the pass-through securities.   During the past 10 days, six Remics totaling $2 billion have been priced using Fannie Mae 10% bonds.   In the mortgage pass-through market, Ginnie Mae 9% securities for November delivery were quoted at 95 3/8, down 1/4; 9 1/2% securities at 98 1/8, down 10/32; 10% securities at 100 3/4, down 1/4; and Freddie Mac 9 1/2% securities at 97 7/8, down 1/4.   The Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% securities were yielding 9.90% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note tightened one basis point to 100 basis points.   Municipal Issues   Municipal bonds slumped, with active issues falling about 1/4 to 5/8 point from Friday's closing levels.   The slump became apparent right near the session's start, as concern over the stronger than expected October employment data reported Friday continued to pervade the market. Prices continued to slide as the session progressed, with erosion of the U.S. dollar adding to the losses.   The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due 2018 fell 1/2 point to 95 1/8. The yield rose to 7.61% from 7.56%.   New issue activity was modest in the tax-exempt marketplace. Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets set the preliminary pricing on $132.7 million of general improvement refunding bonds from San Antonio, Texas. The tentative pricing left reoffering yields between 6.50% in 1994 and 7.55% in 2009.   Corporate Bonds   Prices were little changed to off 1/4 point in light trading.   Meanwhile, added to the pricing calendar for this week was Ampex Group Inc.'s $225 million of eight-year senior notes through underwriters led by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   The notes will be noncallable for three years and are rated single-B-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-B-plus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.   Ampex, a manufacturer of professional digital and analog audio-video equipment, will use proceeds from the debt offering to pay its debts under the company's bank loan agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
