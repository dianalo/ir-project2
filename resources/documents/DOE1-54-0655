Dependences are presentedof the average number of hadrons produced in electromagnetic and nuclearshowers on the effective energy of the muon and on the energy releaseof the shower in the detector, and also distributions of showers in thenumber of hadrons recorded in them, for various energy intervals. A methodof separation of electromagnetic and nuclear showers on the basis ofthe number of neutrons contained in them is described.</TEXT></DOC>
