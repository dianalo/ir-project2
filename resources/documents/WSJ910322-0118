Hurwitz bid 43 cents on thedollar to win the first bulk sale of distressed savings andloan assets by Resolution Trust Corp., raising hopes that thefederal agency can speed up its $144 billion liquidationchore.   Mr. Hurwitz's Maxxam Inc. paid $130.1 million in cash for32 distressed loans and 26 foreclosed properties, largelyTexas apartment complexes. The portfolio was valued at $300million on the books of the insolvent Commonwealth Federaland Alamo Federal savings and loan associations, both of SanAntonio, Texas, and appraised by the RTC in January at $180million.</LP><TEXT>   Maxxam offered to pay $181.5 million for the properties ifthe RTC would agree to finance 85% of the sale. The RTC optedfor the cash. Maxxam was the highest of 10 bidders in bothcash and financing categories.   Deep discounts notwithstanding, the RTC declared the salea success and announced plans to press ahead with $3.5billion in bulk sales by year end.   &quot;Bulk sales are much less money than they could havegotten for the properties individually,&quot; says Will J.Cureton, president of Dallas-based Texana Interests Inc.,which plans to bid for the bulk sale of defunct Bright Bancof Dallas. &quot;But some of the properties couldn't be sold forany price.&quot; Carrying costs on the unsalable properties wouldquickly eat up any gains in individual sales, in the RTC'sview.   The biggest plus was the speed of the sale. Opening with apublic meeting in January, the pace required potentialinvestors to evaluate the properties at a rate of two a dayto meet RTC deadlines. The government liquidators, however,offer Maxxam a period of time to reopen the deal if itdiscovers substantial discrepancies in the RTC's offeringmaterials that describe the assets.   The riskiest assets in the portfolio are the nonperformingloans, as the borrowers could tie up Maxxam in bankruptcycourt or other legal actions. &quot;The first buyers in thesesales are going to be adventurers,&quot; says John W. Gray, a vicepresident at Security Pacific National Bank and an adviser tothe RTC.   That certainly describes Mr. Hurwitz, a corporate raiderwith an appetite for debt and a reputation for strippingassets from companies he acquires. Maxxam, based in Houston,owns Kaiser Aluminum andamp; Chemical Corp. and Pacific Lumber Co.and has extensive real estate holdings.   Other investors are also intrigued, said Washingtonattorney Thomas P. Vartanian, who represented a bidder. &quot;Ithink most investors were favorably impressed,&quot; he said.   The Bright Banc sale coming up in May will be a toughertest of the bulk-sale method. Featuring mostly land, theasset portfolio will be difficult to price and impossible tofinance privately, says Mr. Cureton, the Dallas investor.&quot;There's no financing for land,&quot; he says.   Maxxam has interests in aluminum, forest products and realestate.</TEXT></DOC>
