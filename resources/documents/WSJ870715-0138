Mr. Wattenberg notes correctly that the industrialized West effectively has won the fight against rapid, destabilizing population growth, while much of the Third World continues to careen toward overpopulation. But he offers a most curious prescription: Americans and other Westerners should join in some sort of all-out fertility race with the non-Western world.    It is true that the world is largely divided into those industrialized nations that enjoy stabilized population growth along with improving economic fortunes, and those nations in the Third World that suffer from explosive population growth and economic deterioration. The solution, obviously, is to help the developing world achieve the sort of social and economic stability now found in the industrialized world; it is most certainly not for the West to emulate the cycle of overpopulation and despair that now grips so many struggling Third World nations.    Werner Fornos   President   The Population Institute   Washington   ---   Mr. Wattenberg's birth-dearth warnings reminded me of a passage from one of my favorite works of literature:    &quot;Civilization's going to pieces,&quot; broke out Tom violently. &quot;I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this man Goddard?    &quot;Why, no,&quot; I answered, rather surprised by his tone.    &quot;Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be -- will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved.&quot;    &quot;Tom's getting very profound,&quot; said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. &quot;He reads deep books with long words in them. What was the word we -- &quot; &quot;Well, these books are all scientific,&quot; insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. &quot;This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.&quot;    While this passage may sound as though it came from Mr. Wattenberg, in fact it is from &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; written in 1925. It seems that the &quot;submergence of the white race&quot; theory is one of those repugnant myths that refuses to die. It's just a shame that a noted scholar like Mr. Wattenberg helps to perpetuate it.    Jeffrey Bendix   Cleveland Heights, Ohio   ---   So our fertility rate is down. U.S. fertility has declined since the first U.S. census in 1790, when the birth rate was 55 births per 1,000. Today, it is 15.5 per 1,000, but the U.S. remains the fastest growing of the industrialized nations. History has shown that fertility rates vary considerably over time, and demographers' past projections have been way off. Mr. Wattenberg's use of one fertility rate to project our population well into the future is a technique unsupported by any scientist.    More is not necessarily better: Stability is better. A large population places enormous stress on our resources and environment. Soil erosion, loss of prime farmland, urban sprawl, water shortages, pollution, and sewage and garbage disposal difficulties are just a few of our problems. As our population grows, these strains will intensify. We therefore celebrate the vision of a steady-state population in harmony with the environment in this country.    M. Rupert Cutler   Executive Director   Population-Environment Balance   Washington   ---   As painful as it may be, we should force ourselves to ask whether, for a majority of the population, life really is desirable. Do the pleasures and benefits of our existence fully compensate for the inevitable and often savaging encounters with suffering, frustration and futility? We should acknowledge that people who do not have children may have eminently solid, compassionate reasons -- more defensible than an egregiously selfish urging for more consumers and potential draftees.
