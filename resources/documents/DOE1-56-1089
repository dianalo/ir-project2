<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-56-1089 </DOCNO><TEXT>In boiler-making practice it is frequently found today that perpendicularto the direction of flow standing waves occur on the rear of tube bundles.These undesirable standing waves are caused by Karman vortices exhibitinga specific separation frequency. The present paper is an attempt at makingthis undesirable phenomenon understandable and to furnish a remedy. Forthis purpose the mechanical model of a rigid rotating roll subject tocircumferential friction is used. Part 2 of the paper will be publishedin the next issue and will deal with a physical interpretation of thephenomenon by resorting to the Magnus effect.</TEXT></DOC>
