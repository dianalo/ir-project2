Michael Dukakis wondelegate-rich Texas on Tuesday, sweeping the top three delegatestates in Democratic presidential primaries, while Vice PresidentGeorge Bush coasted to victory in the Republican race.   In the Democratic race, with 3,506 of 6,933 precincts or 51percent reporting, Dukakis had 233,204 votes or 32 percent;Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 166,692 votes or 23 percent;Jesse Jackson had 139,612 votes or 19 percent; Missouri Rep.Richard Gephardt had 118,127 votes or 16 percent; former ColoradoSen. Gary Hart had 39,444 votes or 5 percent; and Illinois Sen.Paul Simon had 13,533 votes, or 2 percent.   With 2,013 of 5,616 precincts or 36 percent reporting, Bush had184,472 votes or 63 percent; Pat Robertson had 46,629 votes or 16percent; Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had 40,808 votes or 14 percent; andNew York Rep. Jack Kemp had 14,366 votes or 5 percent.   Texas offered the highest number of Democratic delegates onSuper Tuesday, with 183. Dukakis also carried Florida, which has136 Democratic delegates, and Massachusetts, which has 98 delegates.   Also on the ballot, three-term Sen. Lloyd Bentsen wonrenomination against Democratic primary opponent Joe Sullivan, aSan Antonio college professor. Republicans seeking to challengeBentsen were Rep. Beau Boulter of Amarillo, former state Rep.Milton Fox of Austin, Georgetown industrialist Ned Snead andHouston businessman Wes Gilbreath.   Bush, who rents a motel in Houston so he can vote in Texas,pushed hard for the biggest prize of Super Tuesday: Texas' 111convention delegates.   ``Texas is the jewel in the crown of the 20-state SuperTuesday,'' former U.S. Sen. Ralph Yarborough said in reference tothe state offering more delegates than any other in Tuesday'sprimaries.   Voter registration was up by more than 500,000 and Secretary ofState Jack Rains predicted the total vote could go as high as 2.5million.   Bush, who built an oil business in Texas, led in pollsthroughout the campaign.   ``As a Texan, I know our state's special needs,'' Bush said in aletter to potential GOP primary voters. ``For 20 years in publiclife and for 20 years in business in Midland and Houston, I'veprepared for this campaign and the challenge of serving aspresident.''   Bush has staked a claim as ``native son'' in other states. Hewas born in Massachusetts, reared in Connecticut, and maintains ahome in Maine as well as in Washington.   Dole insisted he was giving nothing away although his campaignappearances were limited and he skipped a major Dallas debate.   Since Texans don't register by political party, Robertson saidhe was counting on substantial crossover support. ``That's mysecret weapon. I've got tremendous appeal among Democrats, andGeorge Bush doesn't,'' he said.   Also up for election this year are five seats on the TexasSupreme Court, a bench wracked by negative national publicity overlarge campaign contributions to judges by lawyers, the publicreprimands of two sitting justices and the failure of thenine-member court to even hear the appeal of an $11 billionjudgment awarded in the Texaco-Pennzoil lawsuit.</TEXT></DOC>
