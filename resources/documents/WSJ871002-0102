But there is an alternative, proven way to raise revenue: Cut capital-gains taxes.    Chairman Dan Rostenkowski and the House Ways and Means Committee are trying to raise the $12 billion in new revenues called for by Gramm-Rudman. Half will likely come from user fees and asset sales already endorsed by President Reagan; the battle is over which taxes should be raised to come up with the other $6 billion. But first, we ought to explore targeted tax cuts as revenue enhancers.    The idea that lower tax rates can sometimes mean higher tax revenues, of course, used to be viewed as heretical. And the Joint Committee on Taxation still calculates that a cut in capital-gains rates would lose money. But the committee insists on archaic &quot;static analysis,&quot; which makes the flawed assumption that when tax rates change, nobody behaves differently. The rest of the world now understands the need for &quot;dynamic analysis,&quot; which tries to account for the economic effect rate cuts would have. And when people look for taxes that are too high to generate maximum revenues, they quickly find their way to capital gains.    Indeed, five Democratic members of Ways and Means, including Beryl Anthony, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, support cutting the capital-gains rate to 15% from the current 28% as a means of raising revenue. Rep. Bill Gradison of Ohio has rounded up nearly all 13 GOP members behind a 15% rate, which means its backers are in sight of a committee majority.    The key issue facing the rest of the committee is simple: What rate on capital-gains tax will bring in the most revenue? There are already signs that the recently raised 28% rate will be a drag on revenue. Preliminary data for 1986 indicates that capital-gains-tax receipts poured in at unprecedented levels -- triggered by people trying to avoid the higher rates that went into effect this year. In January, congressional tax analysts projected additional receipts of $7.9 billion for 1986. The data so far has led the Congressional Budget Office to estimate a gain of $14 billion to $21 billion. But this windfall is a sure sign that capital-gains receipts will be lower in future.    As a result of the Steiger amendment cutting capital gains in 1978 and the 1981 tax bill, the maximum capital-gains tax declined from 50% in 1978 to 20% until this year. But revenues to the Treasury were 184% higher in 1985 (the latest year data is available) than in 1978 -- far outpacing the effects of inflation and economic growth.    Lawrence Lindsey of Harvard has used a capital-gains model developed by Martin Feldstein to estimate that a 15% rate would bring in extra revenues of $8 billion in fiscal 1988, $11 billion in fiscal 1989 and $12 billion in fiscal 1990, thus meeting Gramm-Rudman targets. At least five other recent academic and government studies predict that under the new, higher rates the Treasury will lose between $27 billion and $105 billion between fiscal 1987 and 1991. All but one of the studies implies that the revenue-maximizing capital-gains-tax rate is well below the current rate and falls between 9% and 21%.    Last year Chairman Rostenkowski broke with many members of his own party and became a courageous supporter of landmark tax reform. His version preserved the capital-gains-tax differential, but that provision was dropped in the Senate. Pushing now for a 15% capital-gains rate would probably make Mr. Rostenkowski one of the few politicians in history to deserve election to the taxpayer's hall of fame for two years running. </TEXT></DOC>
