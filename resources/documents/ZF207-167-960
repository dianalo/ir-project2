(IBI) is planning to round out the strategy for itsPC/Focus database this spring by providing first-time support for SQL, aswell as applications portability between PCs and mainframe hosts.andM;The new capabilities will come in the form of two new products slated forsecond-quarter delivery.andP;  One is a new version of PC/Focus for OS/2 that forthe first time allows the PC version of the database to support the samedatabase and file capacities of Focus on the mainframe.andM;The other is a long-anticipated version of PC/Focus for DOS that includessupport for Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as decision-support andapplications-development tools, according to Dave Feldstein, vice presidentof IBI's Micro Products Division in New York.andM;PC/Focus for OS/2 3.1a, IBI's second implementation of Focus under the newoperating system, strips the program of its remaining file-size limitationsto bring it on a par with mainframe Focus, Feldstein said.andP;  Without suchfile- or record-size restrictions, PC/Focus becomes a suitable platform forrunning downsized mainframe applications on a PC, he explained.andM;This support for mainframe-sized databases and files enabled the RedifactsFactory division of Gandalf Systems to develop its real-time manufacturingdata-collection system on the PC instead of on a minicomputer, according toMark Saunders, manager of systems and software for the Neapean, Ontario,company, which beta tested the software.andM;''We knew a DOS program couldn't handle the job because it's not amultitasking system,'' Saunders said.andM;The new OS/2 software will cost $1,295; it will be accompanied by optionalinterfaces that enable it to act as a front-end tool to IBM's OS/2 ExtendedEdition Database Manager as well as to the Ashton-Tate/Microsoft/Sybase SQLServer.andM;IBI's new PC/Focus 4.0 for DOS, previewed at the firm's FUSE user-groupmeeting last May, includes a new report writer, support for SQL and anenvironment for building custom applications without programming, Feldsteinsaid.andM;PC/Focus 4.0, which at $1,295 will retain the price of its predecessors,features a facility that lets users make more concise SQL queries on Focusdata by transparently translating SQL statements into the Focus language,Feldstein said.andM;In addition, the package includes an enhanced Window Painting system thatlets developers create character-based applications with pull-down menuswithout writing any Focus code, he added.andM;As part of its emphasis on decision support, PC/Focus 4.0 also includes awhat-you-see-is-what-you-get report writer that automatically creates forms,such as invoices and letters, from items drawn on the screen.andM;A new import/export utility allows users to create a Focus database file outof dBASE or Lotus 1-2-3 files, and allows a Focus report to be saved in mostpopular PC file formats, Feldstein added.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
