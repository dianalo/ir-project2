Samples of industrially produced powder were pressed usingshock waves as a result of explosive detonation and were sintered atdifferent temperatures. The density of the samples produced is closeto the theoretic one, their mechanical strength is higher. With an increasein explosion energy and sintering temperature the content of rhombohedricphase increases, as well as the value of piezomodulus. It is shown thatby varying explosion energy and sintering temperature one can controlthe structure, phase composition and properties of ferroelectric ceramicsTsTS-19.</TEXT></DOC>
