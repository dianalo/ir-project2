Penny Hay of the Prodigy cooperative defensecommittee, told Newsbytes.andP;  The committee had launched protests of Prodigy'sdecision to start charging for mail messages last year, and some leaders ofthe group were kicked offline, while others were told to keep quiet.andM;Hay said that Prodigy made much of inviting some of the protesters back on,but it was &quot;with the provision they sign a paper which they thought made themadmit they were harassing other users,&quot; something she says they hadn't done.andO;The committee is not a named party to this suit because it's notincorporated, Hay added.andM;&quot;Here you have a situation where the e-mail charge protest turned into acensorship dispute.andP;  The censorship became so egregious that users took acloser look at what was going on, and these frustrations lead to lawsuits.andO;This already notorious arbitrary censorship crossed the line of what userswould tolerate and what the legal system would tolerate,&quot; he added.andM;While Prodigy ads no longer talk about its e-mail capability, Hay said manycomputer store owners are still talking about Prodigy as a `flat rate'service and hyping its mail capability, which now costs 25 cents per messagefor messages over 30 per month.andP;  &quot;It doesn't matter that there's newliterature.andP;  The old claims are still showing up,&quot; said Hay.andM;Ironically, the lawsuit was filed just days before Hay was due to appear on apanel with a Prodigy spokesman discussing the issues.andM;Said Hay: &quot;George Parry will be representing Prodigy at this conference inSF.andP;  They're no longer putting Brian Eck and Geoffrey Moore forward.andP;  He'ssaying it's all managerial incompetence.&quot; Hay said the company's policieshaven't changed, and refers to all the moves as &quot;public relations.&quot;andM;Richard Greenfield, a senior partner at Greenfield andamp; Chimicles ofPhiladelphia, which filed the action, said, in a press release that &quot;BothSears and IBM,&quot; the owners of the service, &quot;are typically good corporatecitizens and we hope, through this litigation, to help them acknowledge theresponsibility that they have to Prodigy subscribers and, ultimately, to dothe right thing.&quot;andM;Greenfield told Newsbytes that litigants with other grievances againstProdigy should contact him.andP;  The next step is for Prodigy to answer thecomplaint, in two weeks.andM;For those who are not aware of the continuing story what follows is thebackground, as supplied by Penny Hay.andM;The lawsuit comes just weeks after the launch of an investigation by theConsumer Protection Division of the Los Angeles District Attorney's officeprompted by similar concerns.andP;  An investigation into Prodigy's advertising bythe Texas Attorney General resulted in a settlement last December thatincluded refund offers for some Texas users who said they were misled byProdigy's promotional campaign.andM;Members in other states report filing similar complaints with consumerprotection agencies.andP;  Prodigy became one of the fastest growing computerservices by aggressively marketing itself as a low cost system with &quot;noonline usage charges of any kind.&quot; When the company disclosed its intentionto impose the e-mail charges, angry subscribers united, forming the firstonline consumer protest.andP;  Many felt the charge a was a violation of the &quot;flatfee&quot; concept that Prodigy was using to promote and sell the service.andM;Prodigy's advertising blitz continued with no mention of the pending fees.andO;Obviously recognizing the appeal of unlimited electronic mail, Prodigy'sactions seemed geared to deny users and potential-users alike an awareness ofwhat would soon become the real cost of doing business with Prodigy,opponents charge.andP;  Information about the fees was buried on an obscure partof the system, leaving most users unaware of the upcoming charges, theyargue.andP;  Protestors used private mail to inform other users of the pendingsurcharge and to advise Prodigy management of their concerns.andM;Prodigy offered no response.andP;  Protestors appealed to the businesses thatadvertise and sell goods on the service and share an interest in thecondition of the &quot;electronic marketplace.&quot;andM;Replies with nearly exact wording suggested that Prodigy was supplyingmerchants with &quot;canned&quot; responses to protest messages.andM;Frustration mounted.andP;  Messages from angry users, some accusing Prodigy of&quot;bait and switch&quot; tactics, filled Prodigy's &quot;Member Feedback&quot; bulletin board.andO;Prodigy reacted by terminating the memberships of protest leaders and banningdiscussion of e-mail charges from its electronic bulletin boards.andP;  Theprotest continued by means of private mail until Prodigy imposed `guidelines'which place controversial restrictions on the content and dissemination ofprivate mail-- most notably, shutting down the means by which the protestoperated.andM;(Dana Blankenhorn/19910327/Press Contact: Penny Hay 213-472-0443;
