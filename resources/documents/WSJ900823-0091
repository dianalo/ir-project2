The prince is governor of Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province,currently overrun with some 100,000 refugees from Kuwait. Agrowing chunk of the U.S. military also is encamped herealong the west coast of the Persian Gulf. The Saudis mustprovide tank-carrying trucks, troop-carrying buses and muchother logistical support to help the U.S. soldiers defend theoil fields, if need be, against an attack by Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   A few miles away, in Dhahran, engineers for thegovernment-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. are working out waysto pump an extra two million barrels of oil a day, crude thatwill be desperately needed to ease the shock threatening theworld's economy if the Persian Gulf crisis continues. Theyare confident that if ordered to do so, they could do itquickly.   The Eastern Province, home of some two million Saudis,amounts to a company town and, one way or another, thecompany -- Saudi Aramco -- is going to take care of theprince's problems.   Who will buy gas masks, asks a group of Western reporters,invited to watch the prince hold court? Who will house andfeed the Kuwaitis? &quot;The government is taking care of that,&quot;he responds.   According to Western experts, the government can wellafford to solve the problems, for the crisis has kicked upthe price of oil by more than $10 a barrel. If it decides topump the additional oil, the Saudi government will bring inan extra $100 million a day, they say.   The mood here is definitely bullish. &quot;We support you withour blood,&quot; says a Kuwaiti supplicant, one of a long line ofturbaned men waiting to hand the prince a petition seekinghelp.   The lifeblood of the Eastern Province is crude and thereis a stupefyingly large amount of it. For example, PrinceFahd's court sits on Dammam field, an oil formationcontaining more than a billion barrels. It has been closedfor several years because the Saudis no longer needed to pumpit.   The Saudi government has assured the Bush administrationand a number of other oil-thirsty countries that it willproduce the extra oil needed to help them through the crisis,although the formal announcement will come after furthernegotiations with other oil-producing states.   &quot;It will take some time, but if told to do it in a hurry,we have tremendous flexibility,&quot; explains Sidney D. Bowers,consultant to Saudi Aramco and formerly chief geologist forthe company when it was owned by four U.S. oil companies.   During the past two years the company has discovered sixoil fields, most of them containing more than a billionbarrels apiece. It has 53 others, including the fabled Ghawarfield, an underground lake of petroleum that is 160 mileslong and 20 miles wide. In all, there are some 257 billionbarrels of proven reserves here, 25% of the world's supply.   Mr. Bowers points out that the U.S. has only two oilfields containing more than a billion barrels and that mostof the U.S. oil comes from fields that are on the verge ofold age.   &quot;These {Saudi} fields are so good that they're in what wecall a juvenile state,&quot; he adds, noting that they provideplenty of pressure to pump the oil. While production costs inolder fields in the U.S. and elsewhere can run well beyond$20 a barrel, the Saudis are believed to pump oil at amaximum cost of about $2 a barrel.   While the economics for the extra effort are in place, thesocial strain of the crisis is beginning to wear on SaudiAramco. So far, according to company officials, it has senthome 3,000 dependents of its expatriate workers, many of themAmericans. Only about 1% of its 11,000 foreign workers haveleft, they add.   Mr. Bowers points out that the company has surged to meetbigger crises before. In 1977, when a fire knocked out sixmillion barrels of daily production in one field, oil workersjury-rigged pumping systems from other fields to make up theshortfall in a month.   In those days the company, then called Arabian-AmericanOil Co., or Aramco, pumped almost twice the 5.3 millionbarrels that it pumps today. Falling oil prices, starting in1980, forced production cutbacks and sent the economy of theEastern Province into a 10-year recession.   The invasion of Kuwait has ended that and has graphicallyunderscored the long interdependence between the U.S. andSaudi Arabia that began one day in 1933 when Max Steineke, astubborn geologist for Standard Oil Co. of California, saw apeculiar, dome-shaped hill near here and had a hunch therewas oil in it.   Four years and four dry holes later, he had experiencedmultiple cave-ins, many broken drill bits and the deepdespair of a Westerner who has spent too much time in thedesert. &quot;No oil, no water,&quot; he said in one terse message toCalifornia.   His fifth well, the following year, brought in the Dammamfield.</TEXT></DOC>
