The experimental technique measuresthe scattered 10.2 eV energy loss electrons in coincidence with the 10.2eV photons from either the 2P state or the delayed Stark-quenched 2S-statedecay. An external electrostatic field mixes the S and P states, permittingthe observation of their coherence by measuring the linear and circularphoton polarisations, while in-plane angular correlation for a zero electricfield determine the P-state multipoles. The state multipoles were deducedfrom a least-squares fit of the measured data to the quantum mechanicalexpressions determined for a model of an S-P(msub(i) = 1/2) superpositionexcited state with averages over the singlet and triplet spin states.The {lambda}, R and I parameters as well as the 2S and 2P differentialcross sections, all determined in a zero external field, are in goodagreement with the pseudostate theory of previous authors. The andless;T(10)/sub11//sup +/andgt; multipole, a partial measure of the coherence between theS and P levels, has also been determined with fair accuracy. The remainingstate multipoles, determined in electric fields, have large experimentaluncertainties.</TEXT></DOC>
