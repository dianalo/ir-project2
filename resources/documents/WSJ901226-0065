Trans World Airlines owner Carl Icahn said yesterday thatPan Am officials pulled out of a scheduled Monday meetingconcerning his proposed acquisition of Pan Am. But Pan Amsaid it hadn't committed to any meeting, and lambasted thefinancier for asking them to consider &quot;a series of longramblings.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The spat casts a shadow over the chances of any peacefulnegotiations between Pan Am and Mr. Icahn.   Mr. Icahn sent a letter to Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskettlate Monday, stating he was &quot;troubled and confused by theattitude&quot; of Pan Am over a merger with TWA. He wrote: &quot;Theconflicting attitudes and signals that we have received fromyou and other representatives cause us to wonder whether youare serious&quot; that a Pan Am-TWA marriage would be a positivemove.   A Pan Am spokesman, however, said: &quot;We have yet to receivea definitive proposal from Mr. Icahn.&quot; Pan Am executives arealso said to be opposed to a TWA condition that Pan Am filefor Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before TWA gives Pan Amany money.   Moreover, it's understood Pan Am is considering a $150million offer for its lucrative shuttle from PacifiCorp,based in Portland, Ore. As reported, NWA Inc.'s NorthwestAirlines would operate the shuttle. Completion of the salehas apparently been complicated by disagreements concerningwhether Northwest would take Pan Am union employees currentlyworking for the shuttle operations. A sale of the shuttlewould provide Pan Am with the cash infusion it desperatelyneeds, most probably lessening its interest in a combinationwith Mr. Icahn's carrier.   Mr. Icahn said that on Saturday representatives from bothsides scheduled a Monday meeting at TWA's Mt. Kisco, N.Y.headquarters to discuss the financing terms on any TWApurchase of Pan Am. Mr. Icahn has said he is interested inbuying Pan Am's 150 million outstanding shares for $1.50 ashare in cash and $1 a share in subordinated notes. Thatcomes to $225 million cash and, at the most, $150 million insubordinated notes.   Early Monday morning, however, Mr. Icahn said Pan Ambacked out of the meeting, which was apparently scheduled for11 a.m. EST. It's understood that when Mark Buckstein, TWA'sgeneral counsel, called Richard Francis, Pan Am's chieffinancial officer, to confirm the meeting, Mr. Francis toldhim Pan Am's team would not attend, and that TWA should sendits term sheet via fascimile transmission. According topeople close to the talks, irked TWA officials, who workedover the weekend to detail their offer, haven't yet sent theterm sheet.   The Pan Am spokesman said his airlines' officials werewaiting all day Monday for a definitive TWA proposal beforescheduling further talks, and that if any meeting was missedwith Mr. Icahn it was due to a &quot;misunderstanding.&quot;   Mr. Icahn and his team have mostly been working on how TWAwould provide Pan Am with a bridge loan, short-term financingthat's often repaid with proceeds from the sale of an asset.In a letter Friday to Mr. Icahn, Mr. Plaskett expressedsupport for a TWA-Pan Am merger but only on the condition PanAm get a bridge loan.   Pan Am executives' interest in a merger has dimmedconsiderably because Mr. Icahn has been insisting he wouldonly give Pan Am so-called &quot;debtor-in-possession&quot; financingthat requires New York-based Pan Am to first file for Chapter11 bankruptcy court protection. That type of financingtypically protects an investor's money in an ailing companybecause the investor is usually the first to be repaid beforeother creditors.   Pan Am's Mr. Plaskett is essentially in a race to stayafloat until he gets government approvals for the secondstage of a $400 million pact with UAL Corp.'s UnitedAirlines. In that stage, Pan Am would get $290 million byselling its routes to London's Heathrow airport to United.   Pan Am was hoping to get bilateral approval from the U.S.and U.K. governments by year end, but talks between the twogovernments stalled late last week and it is likely that thepact won't be cleared until mid-January, at the earliest.   Most international routes are governed by bilateral tradeagreements.   Mr. Icahn claimed in his letter that Mr. Plaskett hasrebuffed other attempts by TWA to merge with Pan Am. Inmid-October, he said Pan Am didn't respond to a TWA mergerproposal that would have involved selling duplicate Londonroutes to another airline for $800 million. That otherairline is understood to be AMR Corp.'s American Airlines,which just agreed to buy TWA's London operations for $445million. As previously reported, Mr. Icahn offered Pan Ambridge financing of $100 million to $125 million. Instead,Pan Am agreed to sell its London operations and other assetsto United. Mr. Plaskett has said he pursued that pact becausehe was looking for a marketing agreement that United waswilling to join. The spokesman said Mr. Icahn never told PanAm about any competitor's willingness to buy the Londonroutes.   Mr. Icahn said Pan Am ignored another merger proposal inearly November. In his letter, he suggested Monday's rebuffcomes because Pan Am might be able to get cash by selling itsPan Am shuttle.   Indeed, Pan Am seems to be buying itself some time. Asexpected on Monday, Pan Am received a $20 million advancefrom United for San Francisco facilities that are part of the$400 million pact. Pan Am said the transfer isn't expected towin clearance from San Francisco city officials until earlynext year. Pan Am already has received $80 million for twojets and $10 million for spare parts. However, most of thatmoney was spent on debts on the planes, Pan Am said.   Pan Am is getting hit by its cash crunch. It said onMonday that A.I. Leasing II, an affiliate of AirbusIndustrie, terminated the leases on 21 Airbus A300 and A310aircraft because the company's Pan American World Airwaysunit hasn't paid $16 million due it. Airbus is an Europeanaircraft manufacturing consortium.   Airbus has issued Pan Am a Jan. 20 deadline to relinquishthe use of the aircraft. The original lease wasn't scheduledto expire for several years. Pan Am said the two parties arenegotiating to enter into new lease agreements to extend useof the aircraft beyond the Jan. 20 deadline.   Should the two sides fail to reach a new lease agreement,&quot;it would be very significant,&quot; the Pan Am spokesman said.&quot;But we have every bit of confidence that we will be able tofurther the leases,&quot; he said. Without a new accord Pan Am mayface having to cancel many flights.</TEXT></DOC>
