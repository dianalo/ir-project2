Fleets of 10 or more cars in the 26 cities with thedirtiest air already face similar requirements under theClean Air Act passed last year.</LP><TEXT>   The new mandate would require certain fleets filling atcentral pumps to switch to cleaner-burning fuels that aren'tderived from oil, such as natural gas, ethanol or methanol.Electric-powered vehicles presumably would qualify as well.Exceptions might be made for rural and other areas.   The Bush energy plan also is expected to propose modifyingfederal fuel-economy standards to give auto makers moreincentive to produce alternative-fuel vehicles.   The administration's goal is both to spur development ofan alternative-fuels industry and to save oil. InternalEnergy Department estimates say the tentativealternative-fuels portion of the energy strategy would reduceU.S. oil consumption by 590,000 barrels a day by 2000 and by780,000 barrels by 2010, and would affect 2,150,000 vehiclesby 2000.   The change would require legislation. The administrationis putting the finishing touches on the energy plan aftermonths of internal debate. It isn't clear when it will beunveiled.</TEXT></DOC>
