Philip Smalley, executive vice president of Sharon, said workers rejected by nearly a 3-to-2 margin the proposal, which would have granted workers shares of Sharon common in exchange for wage cuts averaging $1.90 an hour. He said the vote could hinder the company's efforts to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings. &quot;What we've done is, we've shot ourselves in the foot,&quot; he said. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts. </TEXT></DOC>
