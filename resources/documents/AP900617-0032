(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Why? That's what Marcia Biancardi'sfriends wanted to know long after word of the popular cheerleader'sapparent suicide came over Beverly High School's public addresssystem on Valentine's Day.   It was a question that lingered until last week, when the4-month-old case took a rare twist. Marcia's mother was chargedwith taking a shotgun and shooting the 16-year-old as she slept.   ``All along, we just wanted the facts,'' said sophomore EricWade, who was a year behind Marcia. ``None of us believed it was asuicide.''   Now the counselors who initially helped students confrontsuicide are trying to help them accept what authorities say was ahomicide.   The mother, Susan Biancardi, is charged with first-degree murderand could face life in prison if convicted. Her attorney, Robert F.Peck Jr., says Mrs. Biancardi was linked to her daughter's deaththrough ``innuendo, hearsay and suggestion.'' He entered aninnocent plea for her Tuesday.   He also indicated Tuesday that he did not think his client wasmentally ill and described her as an ``active, loving parent andwife,'' the Salem Evening News reported.   ``For some kids there's fear and for some there's anger,'' saidLauren Terry, who counsels students at Beverly High School, about15 miles north of Boston. ``For a lot of them, it has finally put aclosure on a long, long spring.''   When Mrs. Biancardi was arrested last week following an inquestinto her daughter's death Feb. 14, it fell into line with what manyof Marcia's friends had suspected from the start.   ``Even that first day it was very clear that there werequestions surrounding the death,'' said Kimberly Wilkins, whodirects the community's Project RAP crisis response center.   ``And that made it really tough for the kids to start goingthrough the process of grieving.''   Classmates couldn't make it add up. They didn't understand why awell-loved girl with a passion for singing, sports and people wouldtake her own life. Had they missed some hint of suicidal despair?   There also were questions about how Marcia manipulated theshotgun to shoot herself in the abdomen, and why, if she pulled thetrigger, there was no trace of gunpowder on her hands.   ``It's much easier to understand that someone (else) shot a gun.With suicide, we don't understand why,'' said Terry, whose caseloadhas tripled since Marcia died.   Marcia's father, a bricklayer, was not at home at the time ofthe shooting. But her 14-year-old sister was in the house.Witnesses at the Salem District Court inquest included scores ofthe girl's friends and relatives, many of whom were familiar withthe sometimes stormy relationship she had with her parents.   Stephen O'Connell, spokesman for the Essex County districtattorney, and police said they had ruled out suicide, but declinedto comment on the inquest or any specific problems in the family orbetween the mother and daughter.   ``Yes, we knew her life was not perfect,'' the Rev. DonaldRemick of the Second Congregational Church had said at Marcia'sfuneral. ``Though none but God knows all her pain, we do know thatin the midst of the suffering and struggle, a choice was made.''   The choice, authorities now say, was not Marcia's.   Mrs. Biancardi was placed under 20 days' psychiatric observationin a state mental hospital. According to James Fox of NortheasternUniversity's national crime analysis program, only two or threetimes a year, on average, is a mother suspected of shooting ateen-age daughter in the United States.   Wilkins said the filing of charges is ``very scary'' for teensin the area.   ``Adolescence is typically a time when kids test their parentsand then you have a case ... that raises the possibility of amurderous potential in all parents,'' said Wilkins.   In the days after Marcia died, her classmates began pinningnotes, stuffed animals and flowers on her locker.   School officials, following the advice of experts, quietlyremoved the mementos they thought could romanticize or glorify whatat the time appeared to be a suicide.   ``Now at least it's not something _ a question _ we have tocarry around with us,'' said Richard Cooper, a graduating senior.``But it's not something we can forget, the loss of our friend.''   Maybe, counselors said, now is the time to remember.   Gestures such as the memorial hockey game that administratorsvetoed in the winter seem more appropriate now. Students aretalking about dedicating next year's yearbook and prom to Marcia,who would have graduated in 1991.   ``The kids will need a catharsis now, some constructive way todeal with their grief,'' said Dr. Pamela Cantor, a suicide expertaffiliated with the Harvard Medical School. ``They need to talkabout the fact that a mother is under arrest.''</TEXT></DOC>
