A fixture at drugstores and kiosks in commuter stations, tonicsare the kick that refreshes the hard-working Japanese, famous fortoiling long hours and shunning paid holidays.   Taking a tonic here is not like popping open a cola forbreakfast or sneaking a nip at lunch in the United States. It'smore akin to taking your vitamins.   But it's in fashion. And besides, some of the tonics are lacedwith alcohol, caffeine or nicotine derivatives _ which makes them awhole lot easier to swallow.   Whether the drinks are regarded as soft, hard, or somewhere inbetween, depends on the kind of punch they pack. Some do containvitamins, but none is seriously regarded as an antidote for whatails you _ despite their advertising claims. And many containenough stimulants to worry doctors that the drinks could becomemildly addictive.   So how do they taste? Well, they vary. Popular now are someresembling non-sweetened cough syrup, or as one Westerner describedthem, Dr. Pepper without the fizz.   While the content of the drinks is regulated by the government,few restrictions have been placed on their sale. The strongesttonics are mostly sold in drugstores; drinks containing alcohol arerequired to say so on their labels.   The Energy Pool bar offers over 180 varieties, ranging in pricefrom 100 yen (80 cents) to 3,000 yen ($24) and containing suchexotic ingredients as cobra extract or essence of seal.   Industry sources estimate the market nationwide has swelled tonearly $1 billion, an increase of 13 percent from 1986. Over halfthat figure came from sales of tonics in tiny bottles of 50milliliters (1.5 fluid ounces) or less, according to TakanoriFujimoto, spokesman for Takeda Chemical Industries, Japan's largestdrug maker.   Alinamin V, a vitamin B1 tonic introduced by Takeda Chemical inMarch 1987, sold 10 million bottles its first year, Fujimoto said.``The response was much greater than we expected.''   In developing Alinamin V, Takeda sought to imitate the successof Coca Cola, originally a tonic derived from coca leaves, whichrevolutionized the beverage industry worldwide.   Tonic names often suggest medicinal qualities, while catchyadvertising phrases make the drinks out to be something fit for asamurai warrior going into battle. ``Can you fight for 24 hours?''asks a commercial for Regain, a drink introduced in April.   Many workers may be asking themselves the same question. InJapan, where workers averaged 2,150 work hours for 1986 _ comparedwith 1,924 in the United States and 1,655 in West Germany _ six-daywork weeks are common.   Over 80 percent of 400 Tokyo businessmen polled by the FukokuLife Insurance Co. in February were found to suffer work-relatedfatigue. Though most said they battled the blahs with sleep, bathsor alcohol, vitamin and tonic drinks were mentioned by over 25percent _ more than exercise, a healthy diet and sick leavecombined.   Why tonics? Takeda Chemical's Fujimoto said the current boom intonic sales reflects a break with the past.   ``People now buy the drinks before they get tired, as a kind ofpreventative action,'' Fujimoto said. And, though men over the ageof 50 have traditionally made up the bulk of the market, ``Salesare way up among young office workers, particularly women.''   Miyako Nakanishi, pharmacist and manager of the Energy Pool,said tonics claim to cure or alleviate a long list of white-collarwoes _ stomachaches and poor appetite caused by stress, minor coldsbrought on by lack of exercise, or hangovers from bouts ofwork-related socializing.   But, according to Ms. Nakanishi, the immediate boost from tonicsis what brings in the customers.   ``Most of our customers are after instant energy,'' she said.   As sales grow, however, so do concerns that the drinks may notbe as healthy as their makers claim. Takashi Higuchi, aphysiologist at Fukui Medical College, said the tonics may be goodfor their vitamin content, but he wouldn't recommend them highly tosufferers of fatigue or anything else.   Ms. Nakanishi admitted the drinks may be habit-forming, butadded, ``They're safe, if consumption is limited to one bottle aday. Recently some customers have asked specifically for drinksthat don't contain alcohol or caffeine, but most aren't concernedwith long-term effects.''   After all, most tonic drinkers are lured by the mystique, notthe ingredients.   ``Businessmen work long hours; they're tired,'' said HisakoYoshizawa, a commentator often quoted by Japanese media. ``Oftenthey don't eat breakfast and they don't care, really, what thedrinks contain.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions June 4-5</NOTE></DOC>
