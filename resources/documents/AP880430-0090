The figure includes 37 who died in an Iraqi missile strike onthe U.S. frigate Stark on May 17, 1987. Iraq said the attack was amistake.   The Navy has 17 ships in the gulf, including six mine sweepers,and 10 others in nearby waters. The effort, prompted by attacks onmerchant vessels during the 7{-year war between Iraq and Iran,costs $1 million a day.   The Pentagon announced in Washington on Friday that the twocrewmen aboard a U.S. Marine Corps AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunshiphad been officially declared killed in action. They had been listedas missing since April 18.   The Marine Corps announcement said the crew reported an enemyradar locked on their helicopter before it disappeared. However,the statement did not say the craft was shot down by Iranianforces, as Iran claimed.   Its crew was identified as Capt. Stephen C. Leslie, 30, of NewBern, N.C., and Capt. Kenneth W. Hill, 33, of Thomasville, N.C.   Their helicopter disappeared when the United States attacked anddestroyed two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for Iranianmining of gulf waters and firing at American helicopters. When Irancountered later that day, U.S. forces sunk or disabled six Iranianvessels.   Tehran's official Islamic News Agency said 44 Iranian sailorswere killed. It also claimed 15 U.S. Marines were wounded, whichU.S. military spokesmen denied.   The helicopter, which took part in the attack on one of theIranian oil platforms earlier in the day, vanished during anighttime mission off the guided missile cruiser Wainwright a fewhours after the fighting ended.   Iran claimed it had shot down the helicopter and recovered thewreckage. However, none was publicly displayed.   Seven other U.S. deaths in the region came as a result of flyingaccidents. Four soldiers were killed when a Navy SH-3G courierhelicopter crashed into the Middle East Force flagship La Sallewhile attempting a landing on July 30.   A Marine pilot was killed Oct. 5 when his UH-1 helicoptercrashed in the central gulf.   On Sept. 18, two Navy fliers were lost in the crash of an A-6EIntruder fighter-bomber off an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea.</TEXT></DOC>
