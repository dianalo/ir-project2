SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's military leaders opennegotiations this week with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney onpared-down spending proposals that by 1997 would cut six divisionsfrom the Army, slash dozens of warships and defer missile programs,Pentagon sources said Saturday.   The spending plans, which were drafted by the civilian andmilitary chiefs for the Army, Navy and Air Force, were formallysubmitted to Cheney's office on May 1.   ``There are no surprises here,'' said one source, who noted thatthe proposals, which cover the years 1992-97, are far from beingfinalized. ``It's a submission. The final decisions are up toCheney, up to the president.''   All of the officials who spoke of the plans did so on conditionof anonymity, given that the plans are considered classified. TheWashington Post and The New York Times first disclosed details ofthe documents in their Saturday editions.   The chiefs' suggestions came as Capitol Hill is putting greatpressure on Cheney to clarify the Pentagon's long-range spendinggoals in this time of reduced superpower tensions and reducedchance of a major land war in Europe.   Lawmakers complain they can't debate President Bush's $303billion budget submission for fiscal 1991 without this guidance.Some want to slash $15 billion to $20 billion from the single-yearspending plan, while Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman SamNunn, D-Ga., has set his limit at $298 billion, a number that makessharply reduced Pentagon spending a near certainty.   Following a formal presentation on strategy Monday by Gen. ColinPowell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, each of theservices will present their arguments about their recommendationsto Cheney over a period of several days, another source said.   The secretary must make the final decisions about the proposalssometime this summer as part of the Pentagon's complex budgetprocess. Bush will submit his 1992 budget to Congress next January.   Cheney has ordered the service chiefs to cut spending by 2percent below the rate of inflation in each year from 1992 to 1997,and in that light, the plans are supposed to be the first thoroughreview of the military's long-term needs.   ``They are now in the secretary's hands, and now the real debatebegins,'' said one Pentagon source.   Many of the proposals have been reported in recent weeks as theservice chiefs debated their options. The Pentagon sources said themajor points include:   _Reducing active duty Army forces by six divisions, which wouldcut the active duty force to 580,000 from 764,000.   _Paring the Army's reserve force from the current 776,000 to645,000.   _Slashing the Navy's ship strength from 542 to 488.   _Cutting carrier battle groups from 14 to 12, while seeking anew aircraft carrier in 1996.   _Stopping Trident submarine production with the 18th ship, butwith an option to build more in the future.   Vice Adm. Daniel L. Cooper, the service's top submarine officer,told Congress in March the Navy initially wanted 24 submarines, tobe built one a year at a cost of about $1.2 billion each. The Navyalso has considered stretching out production to boat every otheryear, which would result in 21 ships built.   _Paring 50,000 active-duty Navy slots and around 40,000 AirForce active duty personnel.   _Slashing nearly in half the Air Force's B-2 Stealth bomberprogram from 132 to 75.   _Putting off deployment of the MX rail garrison and thedevelopment of the Midgetman single-warhead missile.   _Retiring the 200 Minuteman II intercontinental ballisticmissiles.   Even though the chiefs have been forced to suggest the cuts,that doesn't mean they are happy with them or want to see themfinalized, several sources said.   Despite the suggestion that the Navy's carrier fleet could bereduced, Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett III still intends to arguefor 14 carrier battle groups, one source said.   ``Cooper wants at least 21 (Trident) submarines. Garrett wants14 carriers,'' the source said.   The official said the Navy wants an option to readjust itsprogram so that it could switch funds around and ``buy back'' shipsin the future if world events sour, the source said.</TEXT></DOC>
