Illinois recently offered state employees universal life plans -- which include death benefits and a tax-sheltered savings account -- after bargaining with the insurer on interest rates and administrative charges. American Motors Corp. doubled worker enrollment in insurance coverage with a similar plan. Usually, workers pay the premiums and keep the plans if they leave.    About 21% of 824 companies surveyed by A.S. Hansen, benefits consultant, offer their workers group universal life policies. Negotiations on terms are important; Illinois official Michael Tristano says cutting administrative fees was the toughest issue. And workers must understand the policies, says broker Asher Shapiro, who uses videos and computers to explain them.    Group buying avoids restrictions based on smoking, age and health, says James Hunt of the National Insurance Consumers Organization.    INFORMAL POLICIES on maternity leave persist after a court decision.    Many companies prefer to give new mothers general disability leave but fear pressure for maternity policies after the Supreme Court ruling that states can set standards for leave time. &quot;The Supreme Court doesn't care what your policy toward disability is,&quot; complains John Polk of Cleveland's Council of Smaller Enterprises.    Bausch andamp; Lomb Inc. says its three-month-leave offer is &quot;practiced but not institutionalized.&quot; Trustcorp, an Ohio bank-holding concern, and Agrotech Holdings Inc. of Miami also follow informal policies. House and Senate members will push for a national parental leave bill again this session, beginning with a press conference today.    PICK YOUR PERK: Companies seek scientists and technicians with assorted lures.    Hazeltine Corp., Commack, N.Y., offers nonprofessional technicians a $300 sign-up bonus, while electrical engineers get a bonus of up to 10% of their base salary. General Electric Co. relies on a highly flexible pay system. General Instrument Corp.'s La Jolla, Calif., unit provides an on-site gym and advanced college courses beamed in by satellite.    Aydin Corp., Horsham, Pa., admits having difficulty hiring some technicians, partly because its perks aren't very progressive. Only a few key employees are offered its stock option plan. AVX Corp. of Great Neck, N.Y., with an office in Myrtle Beach, S.C., says its locations are a plus. But Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Tandem Computers Inc., both near San Francisco, say they reject special perks.    &quot;What finally sells isn't the cafeteria's gingerbread,&quot; says Thomas Murray of Hazeltine. &quot;It's the pay and the career path.&quot;    EXECUTIVES WORKING as temporary consultants become more common as companies cut staff, say job counselors. H.R. Consultants Resource, East Rutherford, N.J., offers a data bank of 12,000 executives, all about age 50, who work as temporaries, and contrasts their experience with the &quot;textbook advice&quot; of younger consultants.    NURSING-CARE INSURANCE will be offered to federal workers over age 50 if an Office of Personnel Management proposal is approved by Congress. Under the plan, workers could convert up to $25,000 worth of their federal life insurance to long-term care coverage and pay a monthly premium. Officials say they want to provide a model for the private sector.    HIGH WORKER TURNOVER in convenience stores is related to the quality of management and has little to do with the long hours, low wages and boring work often blamed for the problem, says a study by the National Association of Convenience Stores. The group issues a management manual to improve relations with workers.    CITY WORKERS in Anaheim, Calif., can purchase home computers with an interest-free loan from the city as long as the equipment meets certain specifications and computer novices take an orientation course. So far, 130 employees have taken advantage of the offer, which isn't linked to doing job-related tasks.    UNIONS' POPULARITY grows among health-care workers.    Union membership among health-care workers increased 6% between 1980 and 1985 and now stands at 20%, according to an American Hospital Association report. During the same period, union membership in other private-sector industries dropped to 18% from 23%. The AHA says the health-care increase results from unions' new focus on organizing white-collar workers in service and high-technology jobs.    The United Auto Workers, Service Employees International and Food and Commercial Workers unions now have special health-care divisions. About 10% of registered nurses are unionized as they react to staff shortages and shift rotations, the report says. More doctors join to protest &quot;the reduction of physician control in medicine today.&quot;    &quot;These people have the same problems as nonprofessionals; they're underpaid and overworked,&quot; says Doyle O'Connor, a UAW attorney.    THE CHECKOFF: The median compensation of chief executive officers at 124 large companies surveyed by Towers, Perrin, Forster andamp; Crosby, consultant, topped $1.2 million. . . . Women at the vice-presidential level and above earn 42% less than male counterparts, says Heidrick and Struggles. </TEXT></DOC>
