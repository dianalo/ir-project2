In Seoul, 300 radical student leaders began a four-day hungerstrike today to demand a full and independent investigation intothe death of the dissident student, Lee Chol-kyu. They claim policetortured and killed Lee.   Witnesses in Kwangju said scuffles erupted today whenprotesters, yelling ``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo,'' tried toforce their way past police lines to the provincial governmentheadquarters.   Riot police wielded shields and truncheons to disperse thedemonstrators, they said. No injuries or arrests were reported.   The witnesses said they were among 10,000 demonstrators whomarched through downtown Kwangju for a third day of protest. Manyprofessors and other faculty members joined the rally, whichstarted at Chosun University, they said.   Students in Seoul threatened to stage nationwide protests,beginning Thursday, unless the circumstances of Lee's death arefully explained.   Dissidents and radical students accuse authorities of distortingpathological tests.   Doctors reported Sunday finding ``a lot of plankton'' in Lee'sintestines, which they said was indicative of drowning.   ``The findings indisputably indicate that the student died bydrowning,'' said Yoon Joong-jin, director of the National Instituteof Scientific Investigation.   Yoon said independent medical college professors and oppositionlawmakers witnessed the tests to ensure credibility. Doctors alsohave said an autopsy showed no sign of torture.   Opposition parties called today for a parliamentary inquiry todispel doubts about Lee's death.   Hundreds of posters rejecting the autopsy results were plasteredon notice boards of buildings in Kwangju, the scene of a 1980 civiluprising in which about 200 people were killed. The city marks theanniversary of that uprising on Thursday.   Thousands of Kwangju students and citizens have protested dailysince Lee's body was found Wednesday in a reservoir outside theycity. Lee had been sought by police for anti-government activities.   Lee's death also comes as authorities step up a crackdown ondissidents. About 230 radical students and dissidents have beenarrested since early April.   Government officials say dissidents are trying to use Lee'sdeath as a rallying point for their anti-government campaign. SouthKorean radicals, who want an end to the U.S. military presence inSouth Korea and reunification with communist North Korea, enjoylittle public support because of their violent tactics and extremeviews.</TEXT></DOC>
