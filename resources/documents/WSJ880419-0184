The electronics, aerospace and auto parts concern reported first-quarter net of $66 million, or $1.07 a share fully diluted, as the company usually reports per-share earnings, up from the year-earlier $50 million, or 81 cents a share. Primary share earnings increased to $1.09 from 83 cents.    Sales rose 7% to $1.80 billion, from $1.69 billion.    Pretax net income rose 15% to $103 million, from $90 million a year earlier. Income taxes declined to $37 million from $40 million a year earlier, because of the lower rates for 1988 included in the 1986 tax law.    TRW's space and defense segment had a 13% increase in sales to $815 million, and a 17% increase in operating profit, to $58 million. Automotive sales rose 9% to $787 million, and operating profit climbed 18% to $75 million.    The information systems group had a slight increase in sales to $126 million, from $125 million, but operating profit dropped 36% to $9 million. The company blamed lower volume in electronic equipment maintenance and financial systems, and said the real-estate information service was affected by a drop in the level of home-equity lending. The company also spent more for product development. The information systems business is expected to have higher operating profit for the full year, TRW said. </TEXT></DOC>
