It said Israel sent a five-man team of military specialists toChina in November and a deal was made to supply the Chinese armedforces with missile warheads and armor-piercing devices developedby Israel.   The newspaper identified one of the men it said traveled toChina but did not give further attribution.   It said there are indications Israel has been helping Chinadevelop its own multipurpose combat fighter plane using technologyderived from the canceled Israeli Lavi fighter. The United Stateshad helped finance development of the Lavi, and the program wasdropped after Washington complained about delays and rising costs.   ``Western intelligence agencies have suspected for some timethat there is a link between Israeli expertise and the speed Chinahas shown in developing advanced weaponry,'' The Sunday Times said.   According to the newspaper, the arms deal was supervised byReuven Merhav, who it said is Israel's consul general in Hong Kongand formerly worked for Mossad, Israel's secret service.   Israel and China do not have diplomatic relations.   The Sunday Times said five men flew to the Chinese capital ofBeijing using passports from the Philippines. It identified one ofthe men as Israel Radomsky and said he was program manager of thestate-owned Israel Military Industries _ IMI. Radomsky``reluctantly admitted that he and his team traveled to China,''the report said, adding:   ``He also said that, far from being a rogue operation, thecovert mission to China had been cleared at the highest levels ofthe Israel government.''   The newspaper said the other four members of the delegation wereall experts in IMI's missile division.   Lawmaker Anthony Beaumont-Dark of the governing ConservativeParty said Saturday night that Britain should freeze all technologyand information exchanges with Israel until it explains the dealwith China.   He said Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe should tell Israelthe arrangement is ``totally unacceptable.''   ``We cannot go on sharing things with people who want to sell itto a potential adversary for mercenary reasons, or with people wecannot trust,'' Beaumont-Dark said.   The Sunday Times said Israel officially denies arms ties withChina, but ``Jane's Defense Weekly, the authoritative militaryaffairs magazine, estimates the trade is already worth as much asthree billion dollars.''   It claimed China wanted to keep its military links with Israelsecret ``for fear of harming its position in the Middle East.''   Israel sought secrecy because a missile deal with China wouldantagonize the United States, which has expressed concern aboutChina's sale of silkworm missiles to Iran, according to The SundayTimes.</TEXT></DOC>
