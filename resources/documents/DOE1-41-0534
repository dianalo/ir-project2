Underground observation, along with laboratorytestings and finite element analyses, were conducted to search for possiblemechanisms for the roof falls. Results of the investigation have ledto a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the roof falls.Necessary modifications of mine layout and roof support plan are proposedfor improving safety and profitability at the mine.</TEXT></DOC>
