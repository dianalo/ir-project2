SimpsonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's charities fear a sharp decline in contributions as a consequence of the stock market's sharply increased volatility.    The market's roller-coaster performance this week has all but dashed the hopes of charity officials that contributions would set another record this year.    &quot;Obviously, people's first instinct is to preserve themselves and then to give to others,&quot; said Fred Bartenstein, director of the Dayton Foundation in Ohio.    In 1986, Americans gave $87.22 billion to charity, a 9.4% gain over the previous year. Of this, 71.72 billion came from individual contributors. While some specialists had warned that tax-law changes might discourage giving this year, a strong flow of contributions during the first half of 1987 promised otherwise.    The fallout from the market crash may be dissipated somewhat by contributions from foundations and corporations that have already set their giving budgets for the year and that are unlikely to make any significant changes. Foundations are required by law to give away at least 5% of their assets. And officials at the nation's largest foundations say that although their endowments have fallen, they don't plan to reduce next year's grant budgets because many of them base those budgets on a three-year average of their assets.    &quot;Even with the fall, it just brings us back to 1986 levels, so there won't be that much of an effect on the average,&quot; said Peter Goldberg, vice president of public responsibility for Primerica Corp. Last year, flush with windfall profits from the surging market, foundations made grants totaling $5.17 billion in 1986, nearly a 16% increase over the previous year.    Mr. Goldberg predicted even less of an impact on corporate giving. Many companies, he said, determine giving levels on the basis of pretax income. &quot;The fall in the market doesn't affect pretax income,&quot; he said. Corporations made charitable contributions in 1986 of about $4.50 billion, just a 2.3% increase from the previous year.    But foundation and corporate donations account for only about 10% of all charitable giving; individuals give the rest. Charity officials now worry that the psychological shock of a volatile market will make many individuals too frightened to give.    &quot;The biggest problem this fall will be psychological,&quot; said Marshall Monroe, director of corporate planning and financial development for the Young Men's Christian Association of America. &quot;In bad times, people tend to be very conservative, holding on to what they have because of uncertainty.&quot;    The bad times couldn't have come at a worse time for charity officials who are gearing up for the traditionally heavy year-end giving season. The New York Community Trust, a community foundation that is made up of hundreds of small charitable trust funds, took in $38 million in new money last year, most of it in December. Herb West, president of the trust, says he had expected to do the same this year. Now, he said, &quot;we're not going to be there.&quot; Instead, he estimated, the trust may take in as little as $12 million.    The Salvation Army of Greater New York, which has an operating budget of $43 million, was also depending on end-of-the-year largesse. It is planning to send out its first Christmas solicitation next week. &quot;That's a $1 million operation,&quot; said Col. Paul Kelly, the divisional commander. &quot;That's an area where we are nervous.&quot;    The plunging market has created even more worrisome problems for the Salvation Army. Over the past few years, the organization has funded 15 different programs with about $2 million a year in realized gains from its endowment. Officials met on Tuesday morning to discuss ways to replace the income but didn't come up with any solutions. &quot;I don't know what we'll do,&quot; said Col. Kelly. &quot;For some of those programs it will have a minimal effect, for others, it will be catastrophic.&quot;    One potential catastrophe is the Wayside Home and School for Girls, a residential program for 48 troubled girls that the organization operates on Long Island. Wayside, which Col. Kelly says &quot;is already running at a precarious level,&quot; gets $240,000 a year, or about 15% of its $1.7 million budget from the endowment gains. Col. Kelly said the Army may be forced to close the program.    Other charities are making more minor adjustments. Margaret Holman, the director of development for the Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said she has already cut the capital equipment budget for her office to $10,000 from the $25,000 it had hoped to spend. &quot;The things that were the icing on the cake disappeared as of today,&quot; she said. </TEXT></DOC>
