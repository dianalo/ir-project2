Academy students Melvyn Malcolm Davis and Gordon Scott Wilson,both 21, were charged Friday with rape and related charges after awoman told police she met them at an Annapolis bar and acceptedtheir offer of a ride home, Annapolis police spokesman DermottHickey said.   ``They took her to an unknown location in the city and she wastaken inside where she was raped and then they took her back towhatever street she lived on,'' Hickey said.   The midshipmen also allegedly forced the woman to perform oralsex, Hickey said.   Lt. Commander Michael John, an academy spokesman, said thecharges are criminal charges rather than military charges. Theacademy will take no immediate action against the midshipmen, hesaid.   Naval and congressional inquiries into sexual harassment andstudent hazing at the academy began earlier this year after theresignation of second-year midshipmen Gwen Marie Dreyer. She toldauthorities male midshipmen dragged her from her room, handcuffedher to a urinal and snapped photographs.   Other women midshipmen later said they also had been subjectedto abuse by male officers and male students.   In May, the academy toughened its rules, increasing the penaltyfor midshipman found guilty of physical abuse of a plebe toexpulsion. Previously, midshipmen were expelled for the morenarrowly defined offense of hazing.   A Navy survey found 46 percent of female midshipmen and 31percent of male midshipmen thought the 4,500-student academy had aproblem with sexual harassment.   Dreyer quit the academy in April to protest the punishment metedout to two male midshipmen. They were penalized with loss of leavetime and demerits and six others were issued written reprimands.</TEXT></DOC>
