To Post Wider Loss For Fourth Quarter </HL><SO> </SO><CO> TPS </CO><IN> CEO </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   TPA of America Inc. said its fourth-quarter net loss widened to between $11 million and $12 million because of costs associated with its health insurance underwriting business.    A year earlier, TPA had a net loss of $753,000.    Tom E. Greene III, TPA's chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that changes made in the company's health insurance operations should make it profitable for the first quarter and for all of 1988.    Revenue for the fourth quarter was $21 million to $22 million, sharply up from $8.9 million a year earlier, the company said. TPA will post fourth-quarter results later this month.    The loss for the latest fourth quarter includes a one-time charge of about $6.4 million to cover the costs of a one-year reinsurance agreement that TPA recently entered into.    TPA, an administrator and provider of health-care benefits and services, ventured into the health insurance business last year, and Mr. Greene attributed much of his company's financial woes to that move. He said that TPA began underwriting policies just as health-care inflation shot upward, and that the company's product was underpriced. As a result, he said, claims payments exceeded premiums and &quot;we got whipsawed in that environment.&quot;    Mr. Greene said that without the losses from its health insurance business, TPA would have been profitable in 1987. He said that for the full year the company's net loss was about $15 million to $16 million on revenue of about $72 million. In 1986, the company had a net loss of $995,000 on revenue of $27.9 million.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading, TPA closed yesterday at $1.75, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
