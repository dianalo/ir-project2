Mancher, the VA's deputychief benefits director for ADP systems management.andP;  Mancher oversees theagency's benefits processing systems.andM;This has been the tough year for the department, she said, because nomodernization monies were available for fiscal 1989.andP;  The administration's1990 budget proposal &quot;actually takes very good care of us next year,&quot; shesaid, adding that Office of Management and Budget officials now support theVA's efforts to improve benefits processing.andP;  The request included $52.7million for total ADP spending in the benefits division.andM;But Montgomery wants more money for VA automation efforts in both benefitsand hospital processing.andP;  He and other commitee members said the currentWhite House proposal would jeopardize the department's ability to provideadequate services to the nation's 27 million veterans and their 53 milliondependents.andM;OMB justified the proposed cuts in the DHCP and the accounting system basedon projected 10 percent savings that did not occur because of thereprogramming of existing staff and system security needs, Matton said.andP;  &quot;Thecommittee doesn't see these cuts as very kind at all,&quot; he said.andM;The VA funding for 1990 will be decided next month when the congressionalveterans affairs committees and appropriations committees meet to work out afinal budget.andM;The DHCP upgrade was delayed after a fiscal 1987 appropriation of $35 millionfor hardware was rescinded because of questions over whether it was the bestsystem to use.andP;  The cuts eventually were restored.andM;These budgeting nightmares appear to be over, said David B. Van Hooser,director of the Medical Information Resources Management Office.andP;  &quot;I've beentold and led to believe that we have Congress' support,&quot; he said, but hecautioned against too much optimism before the funding request becomesreality.andM;The budget request earmarked $10 million for DHCP, Van Hooser said.andP;  Thesefunds will allow the agency to install the final module of the DHCP's CorePlus Eight program.andM;Combined with DHCP implementation over the past two years, this final phasewill increase dramatically the capabilities and information available to theusers, he said.andM;The DHCP, which runs on Digital Equipment Corp.'s PDP-1144 and 1184 CPUs andits VAX 8500 and MicroVAX 3000s, provides VA medical centers with anintegrated patient database.andM;It is written in MUMPS, a medical programming language developed atMassachusetts General Hospital.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
