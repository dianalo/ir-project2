PAULSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A drug addict who cut a bloody path through aDenver suburb with a submachine gun heated up debate oversemiautomatic weapons Friday in a state where residents jealouslyguard their firearms and their freedom.   Denver City Councilman Cathy Reynolds said she intends tointroduce a resolution Monday declaring the council's intention topass a law restricting or prohibiting the sale of such weapons.   ``They're weapons of war, even if it's only a small war, like wesaw yesterday,'' said Reynolds, who expects strong opposition tothe measure.   Eugene Thompson Jr., described by authorities as a 20-year-oldman with an insatiable appetite for cocaine, killed two women witha semiautomatic machine pistol, raped another woman, and woundedtwo deputies and a hostage before fatally wounding himself in a10-hour reign of terror Thursday.   Thompson used a semiautomatic MAC-11 submachine gun, which canhold 32 bullets. Only five bullets were left when the manhunt forhim ended.   Last week, following a trend of nationwide outrage oversemiautomatic weapons, state Senate President Ted Stricklandsponsored a bill that would ban the sale, transfer and receipt ofsemiautomatic assault rifles.   The Republican legislator said Thursday's tragedy would stiremotions on both sides, but he doesn't expect the measure to bevery popular among Colorado's residents, who tend to love theirfirearms and their freedom.   ``There will be an awful lot of heat generated, not much lightand very few minds changed,'' he said.   Authorities said Friday that the gunman, a drug addict with along criminal record, used a gun stolen during a March 19burglary.Investigators said they also had arrested a suspectedaccomplice, Donald Andrews, on charges of taking part in 71burglaries with Thompson.   Andrews was being questioned Friday to learn whether Thompsonhad said anything prior to his rampage, according to Lt. BillWalker of the Douglas County Sheriff's Department.   Thompson had been a suspect in at least 140 thefts andburglaries, and had been sought on arrest warrants issued Mondayfor failure to appear in Golden District Court for probationrevocation, authorities said.   His 18-year-old hostage, Jake Carper, remained in critical butstable condition Friday following surgery at Swedish MedicalCenter, officials said.   Arapahoe County Deputy Daniel Thomas, 36, and Deputy Arthur L.Hilton, 37, were released from Swedish Medical Center after beingtreated for gunshot wounds and shrapnel wounds from flying glass.   In addition to Thompson, the dead included Beverly J. Swartz,48, and Janice Irene Swartz, 68. Autopsies Friday showed thatBeverly was shot in the head and Janice was shot in the head, chestand ankle after they were bound with rope. Shots were also fired atOscar Swartz, the husband of Janice Swartz, but he played dead andsurvived, authorities said.   Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan, who took part in adramatic rescue of two of his wounded deputies by driving his carthrough a fence, held up the MAC-11 after the shootings anddemanded that such ``weapons of war'' be regulated or banned.   For comparison, Sullivan also held up the bloody .38-caliberrevolver used by one of his wounded deputies.   ``Our officers are out-gunned. ... These guns are designed tokill and maim people,'' said Sullivan, who had come out againstsemiautomatic weapon sales before the rampage.   The California Assembly already has approved a ban on 40 typesof assault-type weapons, and similar action is pending in otherstates. California took the action after a man with an AK-47assault rifle killed five schoolchildren and wounded 29 othersalong with a teacher.</TEXT></DOC>
