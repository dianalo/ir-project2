Some humans will benefit, others will suffer. Ongoing studiesinto how natural ecosystems, and hence how humans, are likely to reactto global change are gradually adding to the knowledge base requiredby policy makers for appropriate response; (4) The effects of human activitieson the planet's atmospheric life-support system and the implicationsof related changes for humans are emerging as major international policyissues. Yet the understanding of the problem is still very limited andsubject to controversy, and hence becomes a major obstacle to timelyand responsible policy action.</TEXT></DOC>
