The smaller detector with thin Be window was used forthe low energy region, 1 to 7 keV (Na to Fe K lines). Another one wasused for the higher energy region, 5 to 15 keV (V to Sr K lines, Pb Llines). The energy dependence of the low Z detector was flattened witha pierced Kapton 'funny' filter, and a collimator was put in front ofit to obtain an exact solid angle. The high Z detector was covered witha polyethylene sheet to cut out low energy X-rays. The angle betweenthe sample plane and the detector surface was 45 degrees for each detector.The signals from both detectors were routed and accumulated in a singlepulse height analyzer. A computer program has been developed to controlthe beam shutter, the sample exchanger and the data aquisition system,and to analyse two spectra within a minute. It is possible with thissystem to complete the whole analyses of 120 samples mounted in the samplechanger in only two hours. The detection limit for each element in arapid run was markedly improved, e.g., 1 ng/cm/sup 2/ for Fe. The calibrationrun with 30 standard samples was carried out at the begining of eachanalysis session. The sensitivities measured with different standardsources agreed within 20 % of each other and with the calculated valuesusing currently available data. Scattered protons were also measuredwith a silicon surface barrier detector concurrently with the PIXE runto obtain hydrogen concentrations. Furthermore, forward alpha scatteringtechnique was applied on the same samples using two surface barrier detectorsand the same electronics to analyze light elements H to F. Complete elementalanalysis of the same sample gives us accurate matrix correction factors.</TEXT></DOC>
