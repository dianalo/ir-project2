The healthy results came despite growing margin pressureon the company's core U.S. cigarette business. Smokers areincreasingly defecting from mainstay brands like Marlboro andMerit to discount cigarettes, a trend Philip Morris hasaccelerated by pushing its own budget brands. In the thirdquarter, unit sales of the company's full-priced brandsdeclined 3.9%, while sales of its value brands soared 34%.</LP><TEXT>   In the past year, however, Philip Morris has scrambled tobolster its U.S. tobacco profits. In August, it quietly begana reorganization of Philip Morris USA, its domestic cigaretteunit. As part of that effort, the unit is restructuring itsmassive tobacco sales force, cutting out a layer ofmanagement. Philip Morris won't disclose details of thereorganization, except to insist that it won't involvelayoffs.   Philip Morris posted earnings of $1.13 billion, or $1.22 ashare, compared with net of $937 million, or $1.01 a share, ayear earlier. Revenue increased 7.4% to $13.77 billion from$12.82 billion.   Internationally, operating profit from Philip Morris'sfood businesses rose a hefty 31%, but operating profit fromits North American food operations, which include KraftGeneral Foods, increased only 8.4%. The company said that inNorth America volumes of cheese, groceries and processedmeats declined, reflecting the recession. Operating earningsdeclined 4.8% at the company's Miller Brewing Co. unit.   Results at Philip Morris's tobacco businesses weresurprisingly robust. Operating profit from the company'sinternational tobacco business increased 20%; unit salesjumped 12%. In the U.S., operating profits from tobaccoincreased 14%, on slightly higher volumes.   Wall Street analysts said the results reflect thecompany's intensive efforts this year to pump up U.S. tobaccomargins. Philip Morris has aggressively raised prices on itsdiscount brands, which include Bucks and Cambridge. And toshore up Marlboro -- which was showing some signs of weakness-- the company in June rolled out Marlboro Medium, a lineextension with tar and nicotine levels in betweenfull-strength Marlboro and Marlboro Lights.   The effort to reignite Marlboro seems to be working.During the quarter, the company said all Marlboro brandstogether held on to their market share of 25.3%, despitedeclining sales in the total premium-price category. &quot;Therehas been a significant moderating of the downward volumetrend for Marlboro in the U.S.,&quot; said Marc Cohen, an analystat Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.   Nonetheless, people familar with Philip Morris say thereorganization at Philip Morris USA signals a recognitionthat the tobacco company isn't immune from the industry'shardships. &quot;They are trying to reduce overhead because of thechanging product mix,&quot; says one distributor. &quot;Margins aregetting hurt -- the domestic tobacco business isn't asprofitable as it used to be.&quot;   Philip Morris shares were quoted at $73.50, down 50 cents,in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
