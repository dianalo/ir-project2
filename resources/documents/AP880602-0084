Doctors from U.S. Public Health Service began an investigationafter finding that the incidence of malignant mesothelioma, a formof lung cancer associated with asbestos, was 1,000 times higherthan expected at one Indian pueblo.   Five people, all from the same village, had the disease between1970 and 1985.   Dr. Richard J. Driscoll and other researchers reported theirfindings in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Four of the victims were silversmiths. The researchers foundthat they typically used asbestos mats, which they called poundingboards, to insulate their work tables against the heat of torchesand molten metal.   All five also participated in ceremonial dances. Before thedances, the Indians used asbestos to whiten their buckskin leggingsand moccasins.   The researchers said efforts have been made to educate Indiansabout the hazards of asbestos and to find alternative materials forsilversmiths and ceremonial dancers.</TEXT></DOC>
