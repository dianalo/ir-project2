Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co., the big San Francisco-basedutility, and Shell Oil Co., a unit of the Dutch multinationaloil company, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, will unveil thismorning the first natural gas pump at a public fillingstation in California. The pump will provide clean-burningcompressed natural gas at a price that's equivalent to about70 cents a gallon.</LP><TEXT>   Few drivers have vehicles that can use natural gas rightnow, but the move gives another nudge to the push by naturalgas providers, environmentalists and the federal governmentto promote natural gas as an alternative to gasoline.   A handful of other stations in states like Colorado andFlorida offer natural gas pumps. Amoco Corp., based inChicago, is expected to unveil a natural gas pump at astation a few blocks from the White House in Washington laterthis week.   But California's pump carries more symbolic weight:California has more cars than any state and worse air thanmost, and its energy, pollution and automotive policies ofteninfluence both vehicle manufacturing and other states'regulatory policies. Last week, the state's air pollutionregulator gave another lift to natural gas by approving anatural gas-powered engine that will be used in someCalifornia school buses starting in September.   &quot;By setting up this pump, we're giving real exposurethrough normal retailing outlets to natural gas as a vehiclefuel,&quot; said Richard A. Clarke, PGandamp;E's chairman and chiefexecutive officer, whose own company car is powered bynatural gas.   Mr. Clarke said PGandamp;E and Shell have been negotiating forabout 13 months on the natural gas pump plan. Under theagreement, PGandamp;E provides the gas and a compressor that movesit into storage tanks. Shell provides the pump, the site andthe labor.   Mr. Clarke said PGandamp;E plans to place pumps at six morepublic stations by the end of 1992, either with Shell or withother oil companies. He said the program doesn't require muchcapital outlay by the companies but could eventuallycontribute some $15 to $20 million to PGandamp;E's annual profits-- more if natural-gas powered cars really gain wideacceptance by the public.   Natural gas produces about a third of the emissions ofgasoline and at current prices is considerably cheaper andproponents also say it is safer. But it can cost manythousands of dollars to convert vehicles so that they canburn natural gas.</TEXT></DOC>
