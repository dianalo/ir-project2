We will welcome you, the breathrenin the north, more than anyone else as the same countrymen andbrothers,'' Roh told an audience of 4,000 people at the Sejongcultural center in Seoul.   Roh made the strongest appeal in recent months to the north totake part in the Games, speaking during celebrations of Samil Day,a national holiday commemorating a 1919 uprising against Japaneserule. He also appealed for national reconciliation in the south.   ``Today, we recall our breathren ... who rose up with bare fistsagainst the Japanese imperialist colonial rule,'' Roh said.   Less than one mile away, police today kicked and puncheddissidents and dragged away dozens of them after breaking up ananti-government protest in Pagoda Park, where the 1919 uprisingtook place. Prominent dissident leaders were among those detained.   Roh hinted at his willingness to meet with North Korean leadersby saying he was ready to deal with anybody. He repeated that thesouth would seek to establish relations with North Korea's mainallies, the Soviet Union and China.   ``I will meet with anyone, anytime and anywhere and will nothesitate to open that road however rugged it might be,'' he said.   The new president, formally sworn in Feb. 25, said the OlympicGames could help speed reunification of the divided Koreanpeninsula.   North Korea is demanding to co-host the Olympic Games and saysit will boycott the Games if its request is denied.   South Korea and the International Olympic Committee haverejected the demand, but said the north could stage five events ifit takes part in the Seoul events.   The two nations have existed since 1948 and fought the bloodyKorean War from 1950 to 1953. The bitter rivals have clashedrepeatedly over the years.   Roh also appealed to the South Korean opposition to work withhis government in ending decades of authoritarian rule andintroducing full democracy. ``The curtain has been raised for theera of national self-esteem in which democracy will blossom,'' hesaid.   Roh, a former general, won the first democratic presidentialelections in 16 years last December with 36.6 percent of the voteafter rival opposition candidates split the opposition vote. Rohcampaigned on the platform that he alone could ensure democracy andstability.   About 150 dissidents staged a demonstration today in Seoul'sPagoda Park to denounce Roh and demand the immediate release of allpolitical prisoners.   Protesters waved placards, shouted slogans and applaudedspeeches as hundreds of onlookers watched.   ``Down with the Roh government!'' and ``Release all thepolitical prisoners!,'' the protesters shouted.   Scuffles began when plainclothes police tried to detain someprotesters and other dissidents protested.   A column of about 100 police suddenly charged into the protest,kicking and punching people to the ground and chasing others.Police hauled away about 40 dissidents, some of whom were badlybeaten.   Police also hit a number of press photographers covering thedemonstration.   The Rev. Moon Ikhwan and several other prominent dissidentleaders were taken away by police. Some of those detained includedradicals released from prison Saturday as part of a governmentamnesty.   Opposition leaders rejected the amnesty as insufficient and havedemanded the release of all political prisoners. The governmentsays only dissidents guilty of violent crime or subversion remainin jail.</TEXT></DOC>
