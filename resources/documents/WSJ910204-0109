Alfonse D'Amato's top office aide hasbeen subpoenaed by a federal grand jury investigating allegedinfluence-peddling in the award of defense contracts toUnisys Corp.   The subpoena was disclosed in public documents filed inthe Senate last week and names Michael Kinsella, Mr.D'Amato's administrative assistant for more than six yearsand a former lobbyist for the Securities IndustryAssociation.</LP><TEXT>   The same grand jury has previously called two former aidesto the senator, but Mr. Kinsella is more senior and closelylinked to the New York Republican. The U.S. attorney's officerefused to comment Friday. But published reports, chiefly inNewsday, have described a federal inquiry into Unisyscontracts and fees paid to a law firm led by the senator'sbrother, Armand D'Amato.   &quot;We understand he {Mr. Kinsella} will be testifying inconnection with Unisys,&quot; said a D'Amato spokesman, who saidthe senator hasn't been asked to testify and isn't&quot;personally involved.&quot;   Despite this disclaimer, the investigation carriespolitical risks for the senator, whose position on the SenateAppropriations defense subcommittee made him a valuable allyfor Unisys, even as the contractor was reportedly paying feesto his brother. The grand jury inquiry comes at a time whenMr. D'Amato is already the subject of a Senate EthicsCommittee investigation. And federal investigators also arelooking at allegations of favoritism and influence-peddlingregarding his dealings with the Department of Housing andUrban Development.   The Ethics Committee inquiry directly affects Mr.Kinsella's own position as well. Generally, as a Senateemployee, the aide could receive representation by the Senatelegal counsel in regard to any questions concerning hisofficial duties or actions. Since the same counsel alsoserves the ethics panel, however, the Senate was forced toauthorize separate payments for a private attorney to assistMr. Kinsella.</TEXT></DOC>
