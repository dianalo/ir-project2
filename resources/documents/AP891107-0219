Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the opinionstating that FBI agents have legal authority to seize fugitivesoverseas without permission of a foreign government is consideredprivate legal advice for the bureau that won't be made public.   The opinion's author, Assistant Attorney General William P. Barr,is scheduled to be questioned about it on Wednesday by members ofthe House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights.   Asked why the opinion, which is not classified, was beingwithheld from members of the subcommittee, Runkel replied: ``Whywould we treat the committee any differently than the news media orthe general public?''   ``Bill Barr will go up and talk about it and answer questions,but it's in keeping with department policy not to make the opinionpublic,'' Runkel said. ``It's our view that it's a confidentiallegal opinion.''   Runkel argued that the Justice Department is not privy to legalopinions produced for Congress by House and Senate legal counsel.   The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which Barrheads, issued the June 21 opinion in response to a request foradvice from the FBI.   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, expressedincredulity over Runkel's statement his panel was not entitled tosee the document.   ``Maybe that Department of Justice needs more experience, itneeds an education about how the government is supposed to work in afree society,'' Edwards said. ``And our hearing tomorrow, I hope,will guide them along that path.''   Besides approving the Justice Department's budget, Edwards notedthat the Judiciary Committee by law is required to oversee itsoperations.   ``That's what we take the oath of office to do,'' Edwards said.   Barr was summoned along with Associate Deputy FBI Director OliverB. Revell to answer questions about the opinion, which sparkedveiled criticism last month from Secretary of State James Baker III.   Baker called it ``a very narrow legal opinion based onconsideration only of domestic United States laws.'' The secretarysaid ``it did not take into account international law, nor did itweigh the president's constituitnal responsibliity to carry out theforeign policy of the United States.''   The document entitled ``Authority of the FBI to OverrideCustomary or Other International Law in the Course ofExtraterritorial Law Enforcement Activities'' reverses a 1980 legalopinion that the FBI could not arrest a fugitive without obtaining aforeign government's permission.   The earlier opinion, written in response to a query over whetherthe FBI had authority to seize fugitive financier Robert Vesco inthe Bahamas, was eventually published.   Justice Department officials have stressed that the opinion isaimed intended to clarify the FBI's legal authority to seizefugitives from countries that do not cooperate with the UnitedStates or where there is no law and order, such as in Lebanon.
