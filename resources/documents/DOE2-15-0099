<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-0099 </DOCNO><TEXT>Spin-exchange collisions between polarized /sup 87/Rb atoms and unpolarized/sup 129/Xe nuclei have been used to produce nuclear spin polarized /sup129/Xe. Measurements of th elongitudinal relaxation rate of /sup 129/Xenuclear polarization have been carried out in a 5.7 G magnetic field.The present results show that the nuclear spin relaxation rate of /sup129/Xe in /sup 87/Rb vapor is proportional to the density of the /sup87/Rb atoms, and the nuclear spin relaxation rates of /sup 129/Xe inducedby the /sup 87/Rb atoms depend on the pressure of the buffer gas N/sub2/.</TEXT></DOC>
