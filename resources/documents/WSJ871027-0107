At no time did Cyanamid have any such policy.    The situation referred to occurred in the lead-pigments department of Cyanamid's plant in Willow Island, W. Va. Cyanamid's medical director advised the company that lead levels in the workshop might pose a danger to unborn fetuses. It was the result of our medical director's recommendation that the company imposed the working restrictions and offered women employed there the option of being transferred to another department in accordance with the union contract regarding job seniority.    The working environment in the pigments facility was in complete compliance with federal standards. Cyanamid called in industrial hygiene consultants who advised that there was no technology available at the time that would reduce the amount of contaminants to a point of no exposure, no matter how much was spent in changing the manufacturing process or improving environmental protection. It could not be done.    At no time did the company tell its women workers to have themselves sterilized or lose their jobs. The words &quot;sterilized&quot; or &quot;sterilization&quot; were not mentioned or referred to in the policy. What we did tell them was that we could not allow them to work in an environment that might cause harm to unborn children.    Cyanamid would like to stress that while this was an unfortunate and unhappy circumstance, it was the result of our continuing research into environmental factors in the workplace and our concern for the safety and welfare of our employees.    Martin B. Friedman   Vice President   American Cyanamid Co.   Wayne, N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
