CO-dependent growth profiles and energeticsindicated that supplemental CO{sub 2} was fundamental to efficient growthat the expense of CO. Overall product stoichiometry approximated 6.5CO{yields} CH{sub 3}CO{sub 2}H + 3.5CO{sub 2} + 0.6 cell C + 0.5 unrecoveredC. Initial CO/CO{sub 2} ratios of 2 to 4 yielded optimal doubling timesand cell yields. Maximal Y/sub CO/ values approximated 2.5 g of celldry weight per mol of CO consumed; Y/sub H2/ was considerably lower thanY/sub CO/. Cross-transfer growth experiments and protein profiles indicateddifferential expression of genes between CO and methanol cultures.</TEXT></DOC>
