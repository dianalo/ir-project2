SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Population pressures threaten to disruptpolitical and social conditions in many nations, according to a newstudy that finds Japan the world's most stable nation and Mauritaniathe most unstable.   The report from the private Population Crisis Committee, releasedSunday, put the United States in the ``moderate'' category, losingground to 16 countries rated as more stable because of this nation'sethnic conflicts and high rate of youth unemployment.   The analysis by Sharon L. Camp, Marshall Green and Patricia G.Barnett noted that ``rapid population growth, especially whenoverlaid with sharp ethnic divisions, places enormous strains onpolitical institutions.''   ``Not surprisingly the two most deeply troubled areas of theglobe are Africa and the Middle East, with the world's highestgrowth rates,'' commented Green, a retired ambassador.   The analysis was compiled by rating a variety of factors andtotaling the results.   Population growth rates, movement to urban areas, the agestructure of populations, growth of the labor force and presence orabsence of ethnic and language division in a country were the majorpopulation factors considered.   The study took into account changes in government over the last30 years or so, political freedoms, civil liberties, ethnic orreligious conflicts and an estimate of the satisfaction orfrustration of youth in a country.   Mauritania, situated astride the Sahara desert and the dry Sahelsteppe region in West Africa, led the list for instability with a 95score out of a possible 100. It also ranked high in separatepopulation pressure rankings, scoring 71 out of 100.   Rounding out the five most unstable nations were Ethiopia,scoring 87; Zaire, 83; and Burundi and the Sudan, 81 each.   All five have been through several governments and all but Zairescored the maximum in communal violence, with bitter conflictsunderway in several of these countries. All five also ranked high inthe study of population pressures.   On the 100-point instability scale, Japan accumulated only 13points and was also near the bottom of the population pressuresstudy.   The United States, by comparison, accumulated 31 points in theinstability analysis.   Both nations managed a top ranking of 1 point for governmentchanges, political and civil rights.   In the category of ethnic and religious conflicts, however, whileJapan had one point the United States was given 10 of a possible 20.   And, in the dissatisfied youth category, unemployment hurt theU.S., which scored 18 out of 40 possible points, compared with 9points for Japan.   Countries falling between Japan and the United States wereNorway, 18; Switzerland, 20; Italy, Denmark and Australia, 21 each;Sweden and Belgium, 22 each; West Germany, 23; Venezuela, 24; CostaRica, 25; Jamaica, 28; Netherlands, 29; and Greece, Canada andBotswana, 30 each.   Tied with the United States at a rating of 31 were Spain andFrance.   The committee, which advocates family planning, said, ``It isclear from trends widely evident in the world that rapid growth of acountry's population, along with its maldistribution, will imposegreat strains on existing political, social and economic structuresand on relations between nations.''   Of 120 countries studied, 101 showed a relationship betweenpopulation pressures and political stability, the group concluded.It said only a handful of governments with rapid population growthhave maintained stable governments with good records on civil andpolitical rights, notably Botswana, Jamaica, Costa Rica, Gambia andVenezuela.   China, where student attempts to promote democracy recently endedin military violence, scored a 57 rating on the index, placing it inthe ``high'' category for instability.   That score may be too low in light of recent events, thecommittee said in an addendum issued with the report.</TEXT></DOC>
