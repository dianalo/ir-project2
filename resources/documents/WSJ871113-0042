Those cattle will probably flood meatpacking houses next spring.    Speculation surrounding the Agriculture Department report, set for release Monday, is pushing traders to the sidelines. February and April contracts dropped fractionally in trading yesterday.    The monthly report is an important indicator of the size of the nation's cattle herd and how soon it will go to slaughter. Livestock analysts expect the October report to show a 7% to 11% jump in the number of young cattle put onto feed lots.    After the report is released, cattle-futures prices are expected to be driven in large part on how deep the nation's big cattle operators manage to scale back this month. &quot;The November report will be really interesting,&quot; said Joel Karlin, a livestock analyst for Research Department Inc., Chicago.    Most livestock analysts were expecting a minor drop this month in the number of young cattle put onto feed lots. Many feed lots are so full they don't have the space to add new cattle at the rate they did last year.    There are signs that feed-lot operators are beginning to backpedal even more than originally projected. &quot;People are more cautious,&quot; said Jeff Purviness, manager of the Lone Star Feedyard in Happy, Texas.    The drop registered in major consumer-confidence polls since the Oct. 19 stockmarket crash is sparking projections that demand for expensive meat, such as choice beef, will decline. &quot;That's waked up people,&quot; said Charles Levitt, a livestock analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., Chicago.    Those projections have depressed the prices of futures contracts for the delivery of cattle next spring, according to some analysts. That price drop in turn is preventing feed-lot operators from using futures contracts to lock in some sort of profit for themselves even if cash prices fall. &quot;They can't hedge,&quot; said Steve Reed, an Agriculture Department economist. &quot;So they are absorbing more risk.&quot;    Many feed-lot operators don't want to take that risk. After more than a year of big profits from low feed costs and high beef prices, competition among them has raised the price of young cattle and eroded profit margins.    &quot;There could be a big drop&quot; in new cattle going on feed, said Ladd Hitch Jr., chairman of a Guymon, Okla.-based feed-lot company. &quot;In addition to the fears over the futures, the replacement cattle just aren't available.&quot;    Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill., said he expects a 5% to 10% drop from November 1986 in the number of new cattle placed on feed lots. Earlier in October, Mr. Morgan was projecting about a 4% decline for November.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures surged in a late rally on rumors of more Soviet purchases. &quot;The big uncertainty is what quantity of buying the Russians have done over the last four weeks. It keeps pushing the prices higher,&quot; said one analyst. After the close, the Agriculture Department announced the sale of 400,000 tons of soybeans and 300,000 tons of soybean meal to the Soviets. November-delivery soybeans rose 7.25 cents to close at $5.5475 a bushel. The gains occurred despite the release of an estimated 10 million bushels of surplus beans by the Commodity Credit Corp., Wednesday. In the past, releases have tended to depress prices for a day or so, but traders &quot;are no longer concerned about CCC stock,&quot; said Mickey Luth, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., Chicago. Traders &quot;are saying, 'we don't care, we'll need them,' &quot; he said. Wheat and corn futures finished mixed.    COTTON: Nearby-futures prices rose their daily limit of two cents a pound during the session amid rumors that some Eastern Bloc countries have made inquiries to buy U.S. cotton, said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities. Mr. Simon said the rumors remained unconfirmed. Concern over adverse weather in main-growing areas of the Soviet Union also was a factor, analysts said. December was the only contract to maintain the limit increase, closing at 68.03 cents a pound. James Roemer, a meteriorlogist at Weather Trades Inc., Des Moines, Iowa, said the Soviet Union's Uzbekistan region, which accounts for 65% of that nation's cotton output, remains damp following record snows in October and continued light rains. &quot;About 50% to 65% of the crop has been harvested in the area and collection has been hampered by light rains that haven't allowed the ground to sufficiently dry out,&quot; he said. He added that snow is falling just north of the area, but not in Uzbekistan, where he expects a gradual drying in the next week.    PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum prices surged on technical factors. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the metal's January-delivery contract rose $13.90 to $503.30 an ounce -- a price that pales next to the $604.80 an ounce at which the contract closed the day before the stock-market crash. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery rose $1.60 to $464.70 an ounce, and silver for December delivery rose 7.5 cents an ounce to $6.645. But trading in precious metals hasn't been active. Many precious-metal independent traders &quot;have been lured into the copper ring because of the action there,&quot; said Bernard Savaiko, senior precious-metal analyst for PaineWebber Inc., New York. Copper-futures prices have surged over the past week in volatile trading world-wide.    ENERGY: This week's rise in U.S. heating-oil prices, caused by a bullish stockpile report, for a time spurred a jump in oil-futures prices world-wide yesterday, and briefly helped the December crude-oil contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange break the $19 mark. But by the end of the day, prices lowered, with December-delivery crude contracts on the Merc closing at $18.91 a barrel, up one cent. December-delivery heating oil closed at 56.81 cents a gallon, down 0.22 cent. Analysts attributed the drop to profit-taking after a more than two-cent gain since Monday. Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said there are &quot;still a lot of negative factors&quot; keeping oil prices down. He said &quot;people are sort of on hold leading up to the OPEC meeting&quot; next month. </TEXT></DOC>
