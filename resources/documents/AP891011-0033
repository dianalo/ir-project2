(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A combination of high-tech devices,armed patrols, alligators and rattlesnakes should keep anti-nucleardemonstrators from reaching the space shuttle Atlantis' launch pad,security officials say.   ``I wouldn't want to get into the number of officers, but youcan be assured ... that we feel we have adequate people to takecare of any situation,'' said Gary Wistrand, deputy director ofKennedy Space Center's security office.   Wistrand's comments Tuesday came in response to statements byanti-nuclear activists that they would try to infiltrate the launchpad if a federal judge failed to block the liftoff.   In Washington Tuesday evening, U.S. District Judge Oliver Gaschruled that the launch could go ahead because the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration had complied with therequirements of the National Environmental Protection Act.   Attorneys for the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice triedto block the launch of the shuttle and the plutonium-laden GalileoJupiter probe on safety grounds.   ``We're sad because the court didn't rule in our favor. But onthe other side, we feel like we've succeeded in bringing the issueto the public, that they are plannning to put nuclear power inspace,'' Bruce Gagnon, the group's coordinator in Florida, saidafter the ruling.   Gagnon said protesters plan to follow through with theirintention to block the launch by putting people on the launch pad.   Wistrand said his force, armed with M-16 assault rifles and 9mmsemiautomatic pistols, is prepared to find and arrest anyone whoattempts to get onto the 140,000-acre space center.   ``We're concerned by all aspects whether it's by land, by planeor by boat, but I think the most likely way is by foot,'' Wistrandsaid.   The swampy areas around the launch pad limit the lanes ofapproach, Wistrand said.   In demonstrations two years ago, about 20 people were arrestedon space center property, he said.   ``What we found is that because of the swamps, which includealligators, rattlesnakes and wild hogs, they (demonstrators) mainlywant to stay on the high and dry land,'' he said. ``It made itfairly easy to detect and arrest these people.''   Besides the additional patrols and monitoring devices, thesecurity perimeters have been moved to the outer gates, theadjoining Banana River has been closed to boats, and helicopterswith infrared scanners fly over the area.   The Coast Guard has several boats in the ocean offshore toenforce the security zone.   On launch days, the Federal Aviation Administration provideschase planes to protect the airspace above the shuttle.   Though Wistrand refused to divulge how many men are on duty at atime, he has a force of 200 to 225 security guards.   ``We've had a number of demonstrations in the past and we'vesuccessfully handled those and each time we've made a number ofarrests,'' Wistrand said.   More than 20 anti-nuclear activists used various means to get inat the space center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in January1987 to protest the test-firing of a Trident 2 missile.</TEXT></DOC>
