And that's whyI didn't think the meeting would be a good idea.''   The session with the House Intelligence Committee was in theWhite House Situation Room.   The former White House aide said then-national security adviserJohn Poindexter told him ``You go to the meeting with them, it'sinformal.''   ``I felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by giants,''North said.   North said he had wanted the Reagan White House to invokeexecutive privilege against a looming congressional inquiry ofsecret Contra aid in 1986, but was brushed aside by Poindexter. Themeeting with the House panel succeeded in fending off that inquiry.   ``You start howling about executive privilege and it's justgoing to make it more difficult for everybody,'' North quotedPoindexter as telling him before the meeting.   North said Poindexter was worried that a $100 million Contra aidpackage which was about to be approved by Congress would beimperiled if the administration refused to respond.   Invoking executive privilege would have allowed North to refuseto respond to questions.   North is accused of obstructing Congress by telling the panel hedidn't give military advice to the Contras and didn't raise fundsfor the rebels. The charge also accuses him of obstruction bydenying having had any contact with Contra supporter John Singlaubfor the previous 20 months, and by denying he advised or guided theman who was his courier to the Contras, Robert Owen.   North, contradicting earlier testimony by Poindexter'spredecessor, Robert McFarlane, also testified that he doctoredclassified memos in November 1986 at McFarlane's direction.   The National Security Council memos originally showed ``what Ihad been doing at his direction in Central America'' for theContras, ``the delivery of arms, working with General (Richard V.)Secord and ... building the resistance,'' North told the jury athis criminal trial.   Testifying for the second day in his own defense, North saidMcFarlane first told him to alter the documents in 1985 in responseto congressional queries about news accounts that North wasassisting the Contras.   In 1985, McFarlane ``handed me a list'' of half a dozen highlysensitive memos North had written his boss detailing involvementwith the rebels ``and he said `these need to be fixed,''' Northsaid.   His testimony directly contradicts McFarlane's, who told thejury earlier that North came to him with a few unsolicited changesin the memos. McFarlane said he threw them away.   North also is accused of obstructing Congress and obstructing apresidential inquiry by altering the memos.   North said he balked at making the changes, telling McFarlanethat ``there must be 30 documents that are full'' of similarreferences to assisting the Contras during a congressional ban onmilitary aid to the rebels.   North said ``he just told me to fix the documents,'' but thatNorth didn't do so in 1985.   ``Why not do what he said?'' asked North lawyer Brendan Sullivan.   ``I didn't think it made any sense,'' replied North.   In November 1986, as the Iran-Contra affair was surfacing,McFarlane, by then out of the NSC, returned to help reconstruct anaccount of the Iran arms initiative, and again asked North aboutthe memos, North said.   ``Oh, by the way, did you ever take care of that other stuff?''North said McFarlane asked him.   ``I haven't taken care of it yet, but I will,'' North said hereplied. His former secretary, Fawn Hall, testified earlier that oninstructions from North, she altered the documents by deletingnumerous references to North's direct involvement with the Contras.   The alterations ``were consistent with what he had earlier toldme to do,'' North testified.   ``It never occurred to me it was unlawful,'' testified North.   North also testified he tried unsuccessfully to persuadeMcFarlane to refuse to answer congressional inquiries about theReagan administration's secret assistance to the Nicaraguan rebels.   North said he told McFarlane that ``we should be invokingexecutive privilege'' after two letters came in from Congress inAugust 1985. Also among the 12 counts against North are chargesthat he lied to obstructed Congress in helping prepare writtenresponses which denied that the National Security Council wasinvolved in soliciting funds or offering tactical advice to theContras.</TEXT></DOC>
