A local chemical viewpointis sought through fragment analyses, decompositions of the density ofstates, and overlap population studies. All fragments tend to restoretheir missing C-H bonds when bound to these surfaces-CH{sub 3} prefersthe on-top, CH{sub 2} the bridging, and CH the capping geometry. CH{sub2} anchors more strongly to the on-top site of a metal surface of higherd band filling since the antibonding feature at the top of the d banddestabilizes sites of higher coordination. Similar conclusions hold forother fragments. Thus, the mobility of these fragments is reduced onmetal surfaces of higher d band filling. The mobility patterns of CH{sub3}, CH{sub 2}, and CH are examined. In general, on the way to productsthere are barriers to migration on the surface, a proximity or crowdingeffect which makes it costly for two fragments to approach on the surface,a barrier, small or large, to the reaction with each other, and finallya desorption barrier. When two C{sub 1} fragments couple, the C-C {sigma}*orbital rises from below the Fermi level. It is initially filled andthen empties as the reaction proceeds. Hence the lower the Fermi level(for metals at the right side of the transition series) the smaller thereaction barrier.</TEXT></DOC>
