The council, with Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze in the chair, voted 14-1 to impose an airembargo against Moscow's former client state, with only Cubain opposition. It also said it would consider taking measuresagainst nations that violate the U.N. sanctions imposedagainst Baghdad.</LP><TEXT>   The resolution pointedly noted that continued Iraqidefiance of U.N. policy &quot;could lead to further seriousaction&quot; by the Security Council. That appeared to be an echoof a warning by Mr. Shevardnadze that the U.N. has theauthority to sponsor military action.   But there were no signs Iraq was backing down. ThePentagon released new figures showing further massive Iraqitroop concentrations in and near Kuwait, and TurkishPresident Turgut Ozal warned Mr. Bush that it may be&quot;difficult&quot; to get Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to withdrawhis occupation forces from Kuwait.   In a taped television message to the American people, theIraqi president said a war against Iraq would be bloodierthan the Vietnam conflict. He blamed the internationalcondemnation of Iraq on a &quot;conspiracy&quot; led by the U.S. topunish him for supporting Palestinian Arabs. However, he alsosaid conflict could be avoided through dialogue with the U.S.   Under the Security Council resolution, nations won't allowany flights between their territory and Iraq or Kuwait.Further, they won't allow flights over their territory unlessthe involved aircraft land for inspections to ensure thatthey aren't carrying embargoed items. The resolution exemptsthe transport of food or medical supplies for humanitarianpurposes, but such cargoes could be sent only under strictinternational supervision.   The resolution doesn't spell out a specific penalty forviolators. But it does include a provision stating that thecouncil will consider measures against countries that violatethe embargo. It also calls on all nations to detain any shipof Iraqi registry that enters their ports, if it is found toviolate the sanctions.   Following the vote, Secretary of State James Baker toldthe council that &quot;the more effective the enforcement ofsanctions, the more likely the peaceful resolution of thisconflict.&quot;   Earlier in the day, Mr. Shevardnadze warned Iraq that theU.N. might exercise its right to &quot;suppress acts ofaggression&quot; militarily if the Iraqis don't withdraw fromKuwait.   &quot;A great war may break out in the {Persian} Gulf regionany day, any moment,&quot; the Soviet official told the U.N.General Assembly in a tough speech that also hinted thatSaddam Hussein should be tried for his recent acts, includinghostage-taking.   The Defense Department said Iraq has massed 430,000troops, 3,500 tanks, 2,500 armored personnel carriers andaround 1,700 artillery pieces in the large geographic regionthe Pentagon defines as militarily near Kuwait. That is anincrease -- in just one week -- of 70,000 troops, 700 tanks,700 personnel carriers and 200 artillery pieces.   Mr. Shevardnadze seemed to emphasize the military optionin the crisis far more than President Mikhail Gorbachev has.&quot;We should remind those who regard aggression as anacceptable form of behavior that the United Nations has thepower to suppress acts of aggression,&quot; he said, quoting fromthe U.N. charter. &quot;There is already ample evidence that thisright can be exercised. It will be, if the illegal occupationof Kuwait continues. There is enough unity in this regard inthe Security Council, and there is also the will and a highdegree of consensus in the world community.&quot;   Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, mixed dire warnings of massiveviolence with conciliatory signals in his taped address tothe American people. The Iraqi leader asserted that PresidentBush &quot;pushes your children to a war that has no human valuewhatsoever.&quot;   In his 75-minute taped speech, delivered in response to aneight-minute address by President Bush that recently wasaired on Iraqi TV, the Iraqi leader said, &quot;Let us resort todialogue rather than arms.&quot;   He reasserted his claim that Kuwait has long been alegitimate part of Iraq and that his military move intoKuwait was justified because Kuwait was waging economic waragainst Baghdad by driving down oil prices. But heembellished Iraq's justifications by charging that Kuwait'sactions against Iraq were part of a grander internationalconspiracy, involving both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, tocripple Iraq, largely because of its support for thePalestinian cause.   At the White House, President Bush rewarded TurkishPresident Ozal for his support in the Gulf crisis by pledginggreater economic and military help. The new aid includes anunspecified increase in Turkey's textile quotas to the U.S.,more military assistance including F-16 fighter jets, a heftyshare of the international aid the U.S. has raised forcountries hurt by the crisis, and greater U.S. support forTurkey's bid to join the European Community.   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State James Dobbins toldreporters that Mr. Ozal counseled the president that thesanctions would begin to bite in two to four months, and thatthe true strength of Iraq's military had been routinelyexaggerated in the West. However, Mr. Dobbins also quoted Mr.Ozal as saying that &quot;flexibility was not a strong point&quot; withSaddam Hussein and that it would be &quot;difficult&quot; to get him toback down.   The two presidents, Mr. Dobbins said, complained about therecent increases in the price of oil and charged that prices&quot;were not being set by supply and demand, but by speculativepressures.&quot; He said the leaders believed there was adequateoil at a much lower price and that the high prices would harmmany economies.   Mr. Dobbins said the two presidents didn't discuss the waroption in sessions attended by aides, but the two men held aprivate meeting at which the subject may have arisen. If warbreaks out, the U.S. probably will count on Turkey to sendforces, or at least menace Iraq from the Turkish-Iraqiborder.   In another diplomatic development, Syrian President HafezAssad ended a visit to Tehran by issuing a joint statementwith Iranian leaders condemning both the Iraqi invasion ofKuwait and the presence of Western troops in the PersianGulf.   Mr. Assad, who sides with the U.S. in the Gulf crisis,said he had no differences on the matter with IranianPresident Hashemi Rafsanjani, whose government has been moreambivalent. Syrian sources told Western news agencies thatIran pledged to uphold the U.N. trade embargo against Iraqbut insisted that food could be shipped to Baghdad as a&quot;humanitarian&quot; exception.   American intelligence agencies say small amounts of foodfrom Iran have been slipping into Iraq, and they are worriedabout several full Iraqi oil tankers, which they fear mightbe heading for Iran to unload. The Bush administration hadhoped Mr. Assad could persuade Iran to avoid breaking theembargo. Mr. Assad, Iran's only Arab ally, met with Secretaryof State James Baker 10 days ago.   News agencies, citing Syrian sources, said Mr. Rafsanjanitold Mr. Assad that Iran wouldn't buy Iraqi oil, but that theSyrian leader failed to win such guarantees on shipping foodto its old foe.   ---   Gerald F.
