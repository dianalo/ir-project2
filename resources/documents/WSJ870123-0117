On an operating basis, Standard Oil said earnings declined 82% to $67 million, or 28 cents a share, from $379 million, or $1.61 a share, a year earlier. The decrease was mostly because of lower oil prices, the company said.    Revenue in the quarter fell 37% to $2.26 billion from $3.69 billion.    The just-ended quarter included a net charge of $36 million from several gains and losses -- an extraordinary charge of $30 million from early retirement of debt, a special charge of $33 million from an Internal Revenue Service settlement and a tax benefit of $27 million. In the year-earlier quarter, Standard Oil had a charge of $1.15 billion, mainly from write-downs of assets.    Results were in line with expectations, analysts said.    Citing strong cash flow from operations, Standard Oil said it would continue paying its quarterly dividend of 70 cents a share. The next dividend is payable March 10 to stock of record Feb. 18.    The company also forecast improved performance for 1987 if oil prices average the same as in 1986. A Standard Oil spokesman said Alaskan crude oil prices currently are averaging on a contract basis $15.25 delivered at the Gulf and $14.25 on the West Coast.    Alaskan crude oil prices averaged $12.41 a barrel in the 1986 fourth quarter, compared with $26.37 a barrel in the 1985 period, the company said. For all of 1986, Alaskan crude oil prices averaged $13.83 a barrel, 48% lower than the 1985 average, the company said.    The company gets 97% of its oil from Alaska.    Standard said fourth-quarter operating profit from exploration and production before unusual items dropped nearly 75% to $141 million from $547 million. The 1985 figure included a charge of $165 million for reduced value of Standard's leases, but didn't include other asset write-downs. Operating profit from refining and marketing, again excluding unusual items, rose to $108 million from $104 million in 1985.    The company for all of 1986 reported a net loss of $345 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $308 million, or $1.31 a share.    The 1986 loss included special charges of $810 million after taxes, mainly for write-down of assets, and $34 million of extraordinary charges for early retirement of debt and certain restructuring costs. The 1985 results included special charges of $1.15 billion after taxes, mainly for write-down of copper, coal and oil shale interests, and costs related to a cutback in salaried employment.    &quot;Putting behind us these significant special charges and the resulting losses has prepared Standard Oil well for the energy environment we expect in the next few years,&quot; Robert B. Horton, chairman and chief executive officer, said. Also, the company said early retirement of debt will produce interest savings of as much as $15 million after taxes in 1987 and continuing savings in later years.    The company said that excluding special charges from both years and extraordinary charges from 1986, net dropped 66% to $499 million, or $2.13 a share, in 1986, from $1.46 billion, or $6.21 a share for 1985.    Revenue in all of 1986 declined 28% to $10 billion from $13.82 billion.    Exploration and production operating profit before unusual items was $296 million, down from $2.73 billion a year earlier. Figures for both years include charges for reduction in value of leases. The 1986 lease-hold charge was $410 million, compared with $165 million in 1985.    Refining and marketing yielded an operating profit of $436 million, up from $398 million a year earlier, before unusual items.    Standard said settlement with the Internal Revenue Service involved payment of an additional $197 million related to windfall profit tax valuation of Alaskan crude oil for the years 1980 to 1983. Mr. Horton said the payment was higher than expected, but puts to an end a dispute over crude oil production on which the company had previously paid $2.6 billion in windfall profit tax.    Capital and exploration expenditures for 1986 declined to $1.8 billion from $2.8 billion in 1985. Included in the year-earlier amount were capital expenditures of $340 million for purchase of certain refining and marketing operations. A Standard Oil spokesman said 1987 capital and exploration expenditures are expected to decline to about $1.7 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
