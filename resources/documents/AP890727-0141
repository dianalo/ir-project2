SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bill designed to spur research into thethreat of global climate change drew a warm response Thursday froma wide range of scientists.   The proposal ``represents a major step forward in coordinatingan effective scientific response to the pressing concerns of globalchange,'' reported William R. Moomaw of the World ResourcesInstitute.   Thomas F. Malone of the Holcomb Research Institute termed themeasure ``the single most important legislative'' proposal to havebeen made concerning climate change.   J. Christopher Bernabo of Science and Policy Associates, Inc.,called the bill ``an important contribution toward establishing asuccessful research and assessment program on global change.''   The proposal drawing these and a flood of other laudatorycomments seeks to organize efforts to understand how humanactivities have changed the climate, and threaten future changes.   The comments came in testimony prepared for a joint hearing ofthe House Science, Space and Technology subcommittees on naturalresources and international scientific cooperation.   The panels are considering a bill to increase the authority ofthe federal Committee on Earth Science, putting that group incharge of coordinating climate change research being conductedseveral federal agencies.   The primary aim will be studies of the damage done to theEarth's protective ozone layer and by the threatened warming of theplanet as a result of the so-called greenhouse effect.   Scientists have grown increasingly concerned about damage to theozone layer in the stratosphere, which blocks most of the sun'sultraviolet radiation. Chemicals produced by industry could damagethis layer, leading to an increase in skin cancer and damage tocrops and animal life.   In addition, scientists and environmentalists worry about thepossibility of climate warming changing crop growth patterns,melting the polar ice caps and changing the weather.   Chemicals in the atmosphere, notably carbon dioxide, can trapwarmth from the sun that would otherwise radiate back out intospace. This process is not well understood, but many fear that, asa greenhouse can overheat the plants inside, it would lead tooverheating of the Earth.   ``Human activities may have set irreversible and undesirableglobal changes into motion,'' warned Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y.``As stewards of the planet we must step up, improve, and bettercoordinate our scientific research efforts so that meaningfulpreventive actions can be implemented.''   Under the bill, the Committee on Earth Science would be givenauthority to organize a global change research and assessmentprograms and eliminate duplication between government agencies.Efforts would also be made to coordinate the work with foreigncountries and the United Nations.   Dallas Peck of the U.S. Geological Survey serves as chairman ofthe Committee on Earth Science. Participants include the NationalScience Foundation, Department of Transportation, National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration, Department of Energy, DefenseDepartment, National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Agriculture, StateDepartment, Office of Science and Technology Policy and Council onEnvironmental Quality.</TEXT></DOC>
