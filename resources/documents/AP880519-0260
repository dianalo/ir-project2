(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   They came to Appalachia in the late1960s and early 1970s as eager, young college students determinedto wipe out something most of them had never experienced firsthand:rural poverty.   As they prepare for a reunion on Memorial Day weekend, formermembers of Volunteers in Service to America, Appalachian Volunteersand other federal volunteer programs say their work showed thepower of community action but often put them at odds with localofficials.   If they made some difference in the lives of poor people in WestVirginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia, the volunteers alsoagree their own lives were changed.   Then-volunteer, now-U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller called his VISTAwork in the tiny community of Emmons a turning point in his life.   ``After two years, I got hooked,'' said Rockefeller, who latergave up his plans for a foreign service career to serve in WestVirginia's Legislature and as secretary of state and governorbefore winning election to the Senate in 1984.   Linda Cooper Elkinton, who served in Kentucky, said theexperience of recruiting ``500 eager agents of social change''started her on a life of community organizing.   ``I was not a politically aware person at 18,'' said Elkinton,who now works for a social service agency in Huntington. ``But Icertainly was three years later after volunteering.''   The volunteers' first hurdle was gaining acceptance.   ``The poor people up the hollows accepted them pretty well,particularly once they got to know them a little bit,'' said JeffMonroe, who headed West Virginia's Office of Economic Opportunityfrom 1964 through 1968.   But Monroe said the next step, acceptance by local officials,often failed.   As long as anti-poverty workers helped repaint schools, organizerecreation programs and teach nutrition classes, there was littletrouble with local power brokers. But the volunteers' activismdidn't stop there.   To young, idealistic college students who had taken seriouslyPresident Johnson's challenge to ``replace ... despair withopportunity,'' it soon became apparent that local politicians wereoften part of the problem.   ``When you start fixing up a one-room school, you startwondering, `Why didn't the local school board fix this up a longtime ago?' Then you ask, `Why aren't there books?' One step at atime, you start seeing a pattern,'' said Gibbs Kinderman, a formervolunteer who recently completed a series of radio shows aboutAppalachian volunteers for the West Virginia Humanities Foundation.   Volunteers realized Appalachian residents had little power toinfluence their own affairs because of unresponsive and oftencorrupt bureaucrats who controlled county jobs and welfare benefits.   ``Organizing power groups is a scary thing for any structurethat's taking advantage of people,'' Monroe said. ``They (localofficials) were very threatened.''   Many impoverished Appalachian residents knew well what they wereup against and ``were mad about it _ strip mining, the roads, theschools, lack of jobs, the courthouse gang,'' said Ronnie SueJaffe, now a hospital worker in New York City and an organizer ofthe May 29 reunion in Twin Falls State Park.   Kinderman described county governments in the coal-miningregions of Appalachia as ``set up to do things the way the coalcompanies wanted it.''   Huey Perry, whose novel ``They'll Cut Off Your Project''describes anti-poverty, anti-corruption efforts in Mingo County,said the ``whole system was as corrupt as it could be.''   Elections, he said, were ``more like sporting contests. Andafter the election, the losing party would just say, `They wereable to buy more votes than we were.'''   Perry said it would be hard to beat the voter turnout in MingoCounty, where the 1960 federal census showed 19,879 voting-ageresidents but county records listed 30,331 registered voters.   A Fair Elections Committee, supported by anti-poverty volunteersbut run by local residents, purged the voter registration books of5,000 people who were dead or who had moved away.   Still, the volunteers differ over whether their reform effortshad much longterm success.   In Mingo County recently, more than 50 present and former publicofficials, among them the head of the anti-poverty program, wereindicted on charges of conspiracy to subvert the free electionsystem.   But, said Monroe, ``That they've been indicted at all shows achange. There was a time when people did a lot and never gotindicted for it.   ``There was a time when getting a teaching job, getting onwelfare and staying on it, even getting a job on the state highways(department) were all controlled,'' he said. ``I'd venture to saythat doesn't exist. At least, it's much improved. Of course, thereare those who think I'm naive to say that.   ``You could say we didn't make any significant changes,'' headded, ``but I think we did.''   The percentage of Appalachian households below the federallydefined poverty level has dropped from 31.2 percent in 1960 to 14percent in 1980, according to the Appalachian Regional Commissionin Washington, D.C.   The high school dropout rate among the region's 18- to24-year-olds has declined in the same period from 31.5 percent to25.3 percent, the commission said.   But the average annual jobless rate in the region increased from5.4 percent in 1970 to 7.4 percent last year, according to the U.S.Bureau of Labor Statistics.   ``There are still terrible pockets (of unemployment) in WestVirginia, Tennessee and Kentucky,'' said commission statisticianJudith Maher.   Would a new War on Poverty work today?   VISTA has shrunk from a peak of 4,580 full-time volunteers in1975 to 2,740 today.   Anti-poverty programs declined mainly because of resistance fromlocal politicians and the government's growing preoccupation withthe Vietnam War, Perry and other observers said.   But Milton Ogle, who recruited volunteers in Kentucky and nowworks at the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund in Charleston,said more young people would volunteer today if national leadersagain stressed social issues.   ``I'm not being political,'' he said. ``The fact is, there hasbeen a major reduction in these programs.''   How is the '60s and '70s volunteer effort recalled by thosemeant to be its beneficiaries?   ``At least it provided some hope,'' said Herb Meade of Kermit.``People slowly but surely realized that some changes could bebrought about. And it did away with the fear, the intimidation,that we had among the people. You don't find that much anymore.''   Mae Shrewsbury of Shady Spring agreed the VISTA workers helped.``They gave us more courage than anything else,'' she said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, May 25</NOTE></DOC>
