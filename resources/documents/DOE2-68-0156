The electric utility industry is being caught in the same waivethat has engulfed trucks, airlines, railroads and telecommunications.Congress, the Executive Branch and the Federal Courts have intentionallyaltered the framework of these industries by substituting varying degreesof market competition by prior patterns of government regulations. Thisis happening because the nation's consumers of all classes want morecontrol over their lives - particularly their economic lives. Evidenceof the changes taking place in the electric utility industry are somewhatcompelling. Let me cite some of them: Increase competition among utilitiesto serve new and existing loads, Flexible pricing arrangements offeredby electric utilities to sustain/expand their existing loads and attractnew loads; interest among both generating company subsidiaries of regulatedutilities and independent entrepreneurs in constructing new plants; increasedregulatory reliance on &quot;competitive&quot; or &quot;marketplace&quot; standards in theratemaking treatment of new plant; growth in cogeneration and small powerproduction facilities (QFs) spurred by Title II of the Public UtilityRegulatory Policies Act (PURPA), and competition is becoming unleashedin the electric utility industry. The electric utility industry welcomeshealthy competition where it promotes an efficient, adequate power supplywhich benefits ratepayers. But this is the hitch. Competition in thepresent regulatory environment may not lead necessarily to an increasein economic efficiency. The author can think of at least two areas wherethis may be true. In the implementation of PURPA and with respect tocurrent efforts which advocate imposition of a &quot;common carrier&quot; statusfor transmission lines, on so-called mandatory wheeling. The author discusseshis concerns in this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
