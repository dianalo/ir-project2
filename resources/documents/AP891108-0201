The study, written by the CIA's former chief analyst on theMiddle East, Graham Fuller, also concluded that the Israeli andAmerican search for Palestinian spokesmen who are not members ofthe Palestine Liberation Organization ``is to all intents andpurposes dead.''   The Rand Corporation is a research center financed mostly by theDefense Department, but Fuller's report was a project he initiatedbefore joining the organization and was not requested by theadministration, said Rand spokesman Jess Cook.   The United States and Israel both rejected the PLO's declarationof a Palestinian state in the West Bank when it was made last year.   But while the United States has said it would accept aPalestinian state in the West Bank if it was the result ofIsraeli-Palestinian negotiations, Israel flatly opposes such astate on the land it captured in the 1967 Mideast war.   The administration has been trying to get Israel and the 1.7million Palestinians under Israeli occupation to negotiate apolitical settlement. But Israel has asked for U.S. assurances thatthe PLO will be excluded from such talks, which would initially beconvened to arrange elections in the West Bank.   The United States has been trying to negotiate a course betweenIsraeli rejection of the PLO and pressure from Egypt and the PLOitself to be included in all talks. The administration reversed a13-year ban last December and launched low-level talks with the PLOin Tunis.   ``To talk to the PLO is to move a long way toward recognizingthe legitimacy of Palestinian aspirations for a state,'' said theRand report. ``Hardline Israeli politicians know this _ which iswhy direct talks with the PLO are absolutely anathema. Indeed, withthe establishment of direct talks between the United States and thePLO, Israel now has, whether it wants them or not, indirectnegotiations with the PLO.''   Entitled ``The West Bank and Israel: Point of No Return?,'' thereport suggests that the forces unleashed by the 23-monthPalestinian uprising against Israeli rule ``have now made theultimate emergence of a Palestinian state on the West Bankinevitable.   ``Such a process will be long, painful and complex. But no othersolution any longer seems viable.''   It warns that ``continued efforts by either side to resist whatnow seems the inevitable compromise of conflicting nationalaspirations will prove frustrating _ and perhaps even costly.''   Fuller advises Israel to accept this reality and assumeleadership in bringing about creation of such a state: ``It isimportant that the birth of the new state not be perceived as anArab victory born of force and violence, for this might encouragefurther attempts to use force against the Israeli state.''</TEXT></DOC>
