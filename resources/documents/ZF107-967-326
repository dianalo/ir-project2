(REI) after two of its former employees were acquitted of conspiring todefraud the government.andM;U.S.andP;  District Judge George H. Revercomb ruled last month that the JusticeDepartment did not prove any of the charges against William G. Moore Jr., theformer chief executive officer of the Dallas company, and Robert W. Reedy,its former vice president for marketing.andM;They were charged with conspiring to bribe a top postal official to obtain a$400 million contract for multiline optical character readers (OCRS) in 1985.andM;John R. Gnau Jr., a partner in Gnau Associates Inc., a Bloomfield Hills,Mich., consulting company that represented REI in postal negotiations, andformer postal governor Peter Voss pleaded guilty to conspiracy and fraudcharges related to the case in 1986 and 1987.andM;Immediately following the REI indictments in October 1988, the Postal Servicesuspended REI from bidding for any USPS contracts until the case wascompleted.andM;Revercomb said Justice did not show that REI employees were aware of thekickback Scheme between Gnau and Voss.andP;  Reedy had questioned Gnau on hisrelationship with Voss, but Gnau testified he never told Reedy he wascompensating Voss in any way.andM;&quot;I did not want Mr. Reedy ...andP;  to know I had Mr. Voss on the payroll,&quot; Gnautestified.andM;Reedy may have suspected that something illegal was going on between Gnau andVoss, Revercomb said.andP;  But &quot;entertaining suspicions&quot; is not the same thing asguilt, he said.andM;Justice also charged the company and its employees with working to remove keyPostal Service employees, including former Postmaster General Paul Carlin.andM;Revercomb said Justice did not show any illegal link between actions of theREI employees and the board of governors' removal of certain postalofficials.andM;&quot;REI, as a taxpaying member of the American public, was entitled tocriticize--and criticize hard -- what it viewed to be the ineffective policyof USPS management in the OCR debate,&quot; the judge said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
