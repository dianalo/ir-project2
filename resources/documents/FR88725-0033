Since publication of these regulations,there has been confusion regarding the applicability of the litigationrequirement contained in andSection; 60.35(c)(3) to HEAL lenders and holders.Some lenders and holders have attempted to interpret this requirement asnot applying to them because of the wording of the provision. Since itwas the Department's intent that all lenders and holders be subject tothis requirement, this proposed rule would amend the language of the litigationprovision to assure that all lenders and holders must litigate as partof their due diligence procedures. The litigation provision would alsobe amended to include criteria for lenders and holders to follow in determiningwhen litigation is required. There has also been confusion regarding the applicability to Sallie Maeof certain regulatory provisions. This confusion has arisen as a resultof Sallie Mae's unique position in the HEAL program. Under the HEAL statute,Sallie Mae is not included in the definition of an eligible HEAL lender,but is authorized to purchase, service, and sell loans insured by the Secretaryunder the HEAL program. This makes Sallie Mae the only organization includedunder sections 727-739 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act which isnot authorized to originate HEAL loans but is authorized to buy and holdthem. We note that a HEAL loan, by statute, can only be sold to an eligibleHEAL lender or to Sallie Mae. Sallie Mae's exclusion from the definition of eligible lenders in the HEALstatute has caused misunderstandings regarding whether certain regulatoryprovisions addressed to lenders apply to Sallie Mae as well. Therefore,these proposed regulatory amendments are designed to clarify the applicabilityto Sallie Mae of the sections of the HEAL regulations discussed below.The Department notes that Sallie Mae has been cooperating in efforts toresolve the applicability of the existing litigation provision. Section 60.31 The application to be a HEAL lender The Department is proposing to amend paragraph (a) of this section to statethat, to be a lender or a holder of HEAL loans, an organization must submitan application to the Secretary annually. This change would extend theexisting requirement for an annual application to include holders, suchas Sallie Mae, as well as lenders Section 60.32 The HEAL lender insurance contract The Department is proposing to amend paragraph (a) of this section to clarifythat a holder of HEAL loans must be approved by and sign a contract withthe Secretary. This requirement already exists for lenders, and is beingextended to include holders. The Department is also proposing to add a new paragraph (d) to this sectionto state that any holder that is not also a lender must enter into a contractwith the Secretary annually to hold HEAL loans. Annual contracts are alreadyrequired for HEAL lenders.Section 60.35 HEAL loan collectionThe Department is proposing to amend paragraph (c)(3) of this section toclarify that all lenders and holders are required to use litigation inthe collection of HEAL loans, and to clarify when litigation must be used.The existing regulatory language, which requires litigation in accordancewith the procedures a lender uses in the collection of its other loansof comparable dollar value, has caused confusion because lenders considerHEAL loans unique and have asserted that it is difficult to identify otherloans that are of ``comparable dollar value.'' This provision has alsohad the unintended effect of excluding one HEAL loan holder from the litigationrequirement since that holder has informed the Department that it neverutilizes litigation in the collection of any of its other loans.The Department did not intend to exclude any lender or holder from thisimportant step of the due diligence process, and is proposing to revisethis section to clarify that a lender's or holder's collection practicesfor HEAL loans must include the use of litigation, after collection attemptshave failed, except in the following situations:(1) The lender or holder, despite the use of skip-tracing procedures, isunable to locate a defaulted borrower and is therefore unable to effectservice upon the borrower;(2) The total HEAL debt, including interest and late charges, is less than$1,500, unless the lender or holder has a policy or practice of litigatingloan amounts of less than $1,500, in which case the Secretary may requirethe lender or holder to follow the same policy or practice regarding HEALloans; or(3) The lender or holder reasonably determines, and the Secretary concurs,that the probable expense to it of suing a defaulted borrower will be equalto or greater than the probable recovery of the debt during the periodof a judgment. In this case, the lender or holder would be required tonote the basis for its determination of the probable expense and recoveryin the documentation submitted with the claim, and compare it to the normalcommerical standards regarding expenses of litigation and probable recovery.The Department is proposing to exclude loans with a value of less than$1,500 from the litigation requirement since it believes that the costsof litigating in these cases would be overly burdensome to the lender orholder compared with the expected return. The proposal to require a lenderor holder to compare the probable expense of litigation with the probablerecovery during the period of a judgment is designed to assure that a borrower'sfuture earning potential is evaluated in determining whether to litigate.This provision should allow exceptions to the litigation requirement whenit is unlikely that the borrower's financial situation will improve inthe future, while requiring litigation in those cases where a borrower'sability to repay can be expected to improve over time.These proposed exceptions do not mean that the Department itself will notpursue these debts after paying the claims. Indeed, the Department's policyis to pursue recovery on <T3>all </T3>debts which it receives through assignment. Accordingly, itis important to emphasize that payment by the Department of a claim tothe lender or holder does not alter the student's obligation to repay thefull amount owed under the HEAL program.The Department is also proposing to clarify in this section that a lenderor holder may satisfy its obligation to litigate by obtaining a judgmentagainst a defaulted borrower and recording that judgment. Upon obtainingand recording such a judgment, the lender or holder must either pursuecollection of the judgment or assign the judgment to the Secretary. Thisprovision recognizes that, since the lender or holder will bear the costsof litigation if it is not able to collect from the borrower, the lenderor holder may want to minimize these costs by assigning the judgment tothe Department immediately. The Department believes that, even withoutfurther effort on the part of lenders or holders, the obtaining of a judgmentprior to the filing of a default claim will serve to reduce defaults andwill thus benefit the HEAL program. However, the Department also does notwant to prohibit lenders or holders from pursuing collection of a judgmentwhere they believe that payment will be forthcoming as a result of thelegal proceedings. Therefore, this provision is designed to give a lenderor holder flexibility in determining whether to continue its collectionefforts after obtaining a judgment or to immediately assign the judgmentto the Department.It has been the Department's intent, in developing the litigation provision,that the use of litigation by all lenders and holders would be an effectivedeterrent to default and would reduce unnecessary expenditures from theStudent Loan Insurance Fund (SLIF). Should the Department find, after additionalexperience with this provision, that the litigation requirement needs furtherrestructuring to be most effective in preventing default or reducing SLIFexpenditures, this provision may be reexamined.Section 60.40 Procedures for filing claimsThe Department is proposing to add a new paragraph (c)(1)(ii) to this sectionto clarify the time frames for filing a claim when the lender or holderhas sued a defaulted borrower. This paragraph would explain that the lenderor holder must file its claim with the Department within 30 days of obtainingthe judgment if it does not pursue collection of the judgment. If the lenderor holder does pursue collection of the judgment, and the debtor failsto make payment pursuant to the judgment, the lender or holder must fileits claim within 120 days after the debtor's failure to make payment. Thesetime frames are consistent with those applicable to the filing of defaultclaims for which litigation is not required.The Department is also proposing to clarify in this section that when alender or holder files a default claim for which litigation was required,the lender or holder must assign the judgment to the Secretary as partof the default claim. Although this is already required for the Departmentto be able to pursue collection of a judgment after a default claim ispaid, it is not specifically stated in the existing regulations.Section 60.41 Determination of amount of loss on claimsThe Department is proposing to add a new paragraph (d) to this sectionto clarify how claims will be paid when litigation has been required. Subparagraph(1) addresses the amount of the payment on a claim when the lender or holderhas agreed to accept less than the unpaid balance of principal and intereston a HEAL loan through entering into a stipulated or consent judgment.In any such case, the amount payable on the default claim will be limitedto the judgment amount. This will ensure that the Department will not beobligated to pay more on a default claim than it legally will be able tocollect from the borrower, in cases where the lender or holder voluntarilyagreed to the lesser amount.Subparagraph (2) deals with situations where the lender or holder doesnot prevail in court or is awarded a judgment in an amount which is lessthan the unpaid balance of principal and interest on a HEAL loan, due tocircumstances not within the control of the lender or holder (or a priorholder of the loan) and not due to negligence on the part of the lenderor holder (or a prior holder of the loan). In these cases, the Departmentwill pay the lender or holder the unpaid balance of principal and intereston the HEAL loan, provided that the claim would otherwise qualify for paymentand that the lender or holder has filed by the due date a notice of appeal.In this instance, the lender or holder must file the claim with the Secretarywithin 10 days of receiving the adverse decision. This provision is designedto protect the lender or holder from having to absorb the loss of principaland interest that would otherwise be paid to it had the court ruled inthe lender's or holder's favor, and that was not lost due to any faulton the part of the lender or holder.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Department believes that the resources required to implement the proposedrequirements in these regulations are minimal in comparison to the overallresources of lenders and holders. Therefore, in accordance with the requirementsof the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Secretary certifies thatthese regulations will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof HEAL lenders or holders.The Department has also determined that this rule is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291; therefore, a regulatory impact analysis is not required.In addition, the rule will not exceed the threshold level of $100 millionestablished in section (b) of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</ITAG>These proposed regulations do not affect the recordkeeping, reporting,or disclosure/notification requirements for the HEAL program.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 60</ITAG>Educational study programs, Medical and dental schools, Health professions,Reporting requirements, Loan programs-education, Student aid, Loan programs-health.Accordingly, the Department of Health and Human Services proposes to amend42 CFR Part 60 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 25, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.

The Secretary's insurancecovers 100 percent of the lender's or holder's losses on both unpaid principaland interest, except to the extent that a borrower may have a defense onthe loan other than infancy.(2) HEAL insurance, however, is not unconditional. The Secretary issuesHEAL insurance on the implied representations of the lender or holder thatall the requirements for the initial insurability of the loan have beenmet. HEAL insurance is further conditioned upon compliance by the lenderand any subsequent holder of the loan with the HEAL statute and regulations,the insurance contract, and its own loan management procedures set forthin writing pursuant to andSection; 60.31(c). The contract may contain a limiton the duration of the contract and the number or amount of HEAL loansa lender may make or a lender or holder may hold.
