<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-72-0620 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new isotopic separation method is presented. It allows the studies ofradioactive atomic nuclei produced in high energy heavy ions collisions.Two experiments were performed at the GANIL facilities (Grand AccelerateurNational d'Ions Lourds, Caen). They are analysed on the fields of theexperimental resolution and of the spectroscopic results. Measurementsof beta decay half lives and gamma spectra are brought for sixteen neutronrich nuclei at the frontier of the experimental knowledge.</TEXT></DOC>
