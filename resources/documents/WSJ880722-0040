Without the gain, MCorp had a $169.3 million operating loss for the quarter due to continuing deterioration of its real estate and commercial loan portfolio. Its nonperforming assets continued to rise slightly during the quarter to $1.78 billion, or 13.7% of its loans and foreclosed property, from $1.62 billion, or 11.9%, at March 31.    For the year-ago quarter, MCorp recorded a $114.9 million net loss that included a $117.4 million operating loss.    MCorp's results are being closely watched by bankers and regulators because it is the only banking concern among Texas's top five that continues to weather the state's banking crisis without seeking a well-heeled suitor or federal assistance. MCorp is trying to raise as much as $200 million in additional capital. </TEXT></DOC>
