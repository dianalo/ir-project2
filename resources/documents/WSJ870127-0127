The nation's largest securities company posted net income of $182.8 million, or $1.70 a share, compared with the year-earlier $62.7 million, or 62 cents a share.    Profit in the latest quarter included an after-tax gain of $105.2 million, or 98 cents a share, on the sale of the leasing unit to New York-based Inspiration Resources Corp. That gain was partially offset by an after-tax loss of $14.8 million, or 14 cents a share, from the early recall of medium-term debt issues. The issues were recalled early to take advantage of lower interest rates.    Before the gain and the charge, profit from operations increased 47% from a year earlier, to $92.4 million, or 86 cents a share.    Results reflected record revenue in insurance, investment banking and asset management. Total revenue grew 37% to $2.77 billion from $2.02 billion.    Many securities firms had strong fourth quarters, particularly in investment banking. For example, Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s earnings soared 73% to $58.2 million, and American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s profit climbed 27% to $101 million as investment banking revenue at both rose about 50%.    At Merrill Lynch, investment banking revenue increased 37% to $364.5 million. Insurance operations posted the biggest percentage revenue gain: 338.6%, to $322.9 million, largely reflecting the success of the single-premium, whole-life policy introduced last June.    The big jump in insurance revenue didn't enhance earnings all that much because the increase in policy sales triggered an increase in insurance expense, largely because of a rise in reserves for policyholder benefits. Insurance expenses in the quarter were up 476% to $270.6 million.    Samuel Liss, a securities industry analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said fourth-quarter earnings were in line with analysts' expectations. Brokerage commission revenue dropped off throughout the industry, on investor reaction to the insidertrading scandal involving arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky, Mr. Liss noted. At Merrill Lynch, he said, this was offset by a strong performance in investment banking and trading for the firm's account.    For the year, Merrill Lynch earned a record $454.3 million, or $4.30 a share, double the $224.3 million, or $2.26 a share, earned in 1985. Profit from operations increased 62% to $363.9 million, or $3.44 a share, from a year earlier. Revenue grew 35% to a record $9.61 billion from $7.12 billion.    Expenses increased 35% in 1986, Merrill Lynch said, reflecting &quot;the sharply increased pace of the business&quot; and the company's push to beef up international operations. Insurance expenses were up 257%, as the sharp rise in policy sales necessitated a sharp rise in reserves for future policyholder benefits. </TEXT></DOC>
