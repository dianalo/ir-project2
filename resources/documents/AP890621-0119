The court, resolving one of the most critical issues facing thenation's railroad industry, said the Pittsburgh andamp; Lake ErieRailroad, or Pandamp;LE, may sell its 182 miles of rail line in easternOhio and western Pennsylvania without first negotiating with itsemployees' unions.   Interpreting the Railway Labor Act, a federal law governing therailroad and airline industries, the court said the Pandamp;LE was notobligated to bargain over the effects of the sale, including lostjobs.   The Pandamp;LE, having lost $60 million in the five previous years,announced in 1987 that it had agreed to sell its trackage and otherassets for about $70 million to a newly formed subsidiary of theChicago West Pullman Transportation Corp.   The subsidary intended to operate the railroad as the Pandamp;LE had,except that it would not assume the Pandamp;LE's union contracts and wouldlay off about 500 of the railroad's 750 employees.   When the unions were notified of the sale, they challenged it asa violation of the Railway Labor Act. The Interstate CommerceCommission, however, approved the sale.   A federal trial judge and the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsruled that the Pandamp;LE was legally obligated to negotiate with itsunions about the sale's effects on the workforce.   Today, the Supreme Court said the lower courts were wrong.   After the sale was postponed, the Pandamp;LE sought a new purchaser.Today's decision also makes that pursuit easier.   Writing for the high court, Justice Byron R. White said the Pandamp;LEwas not obligated to postpone its sale of the trackage ``beyond thetime the sale was approved by the commission and was scheduled to beconsummated.''   He added: ``To the extent that the unions' demands could besatisfied only by the assent of the buyers, they sought to change ordictate the terms of the sale, and in effect challenged the decisionto sell itself.   ``At that time, Pandamp;LE was under no obligation to bargain about theterms it had already negotiated,'' White wrote.   White was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist andJustices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.   Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshalland Harry A. Blackmun dissented.   But by a unanimous vote the court left unresolved _ and sent backto the 3rd Circuit court for further study _ the related issue ofwhat authority federal courts have to block strikes in such cases.   The cases are Pittsburgh andamp; Lake Erie Railroad vs. Railway LaborExecutives Association, 87-1859, and Pandamp;LE vs. RLEA, 87-1888.</TEXT></DOC>
