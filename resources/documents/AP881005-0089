Sitiveni Rabuka was third in the army hierachy and a lieutenantcolonel when he staged his first coup May 14, 1987. He mounted asecond takeover four months later and then elevated himself to therank of brigadier-general.   Friday marks the first anniversary of his declaration that Fiji,a former British colony and once a staunch member of theCommonwealth, had severed its ties with Britain to become arepublic.   To mark the event, President Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau announcedtoday that Rabuka now holds the rank of major-general. Ganilau wasthe country's former governor-general, and as such officialrepresentative of Britain's Queen Elizabeth 11.   There was no immediate explanation for the promotion. Ganilauhad opposed Rabuka's aim to change the constitution to givepreference to ethnic Melanesian Fijians in a future parliament overthe Indian community, which has a majority in the 715,000population.   Indigenous Fijians account for 47 percent while Indians,descendants of indentured sugar plantation laborers, comprise 49percent. Rabuka staged the coups following weeks of civil unrestagainst Indian businesses that is widely believed to have beeninstigated by an extremist Fijian group.   Rabuka remains chief of the army and head of the home affairsministry, a powerful position because it puts him in charge ofsecurity.   Rabuka, 40, staged his first coup and overthrew themulti-racial, Indian-domination government of Timoci Bavadra, justone month after Bavadra was elected in free elections.   Four months later, Rabuka carried out a second coup against aninterim government. Rabuka since has handed power to a nominallycivilian government.</TEXT></DOC>
