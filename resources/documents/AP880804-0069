Blanton was one of four Democrats vying for the chance tosucceed retiring Rep. Ed Jones in the 8th District. Jones, a19-year House veteran, has backed state Rep. John Tanner to runagainst the winner of the three-way GOP primary.   Also running on the Democratic side were Jackson Mayor BobConger and lawyer Ivy Scarbrough. The three Republicans werebusinessman Dan Campbell, lawyer Ed Bryant and party activistRichard Jacobs, who is chairman of the Young Republicans nationalfederation.   The other House race is for the 2nd District seat; Rep. John J.Duncan, a Republican, died June 21. His son, John J. Duncan Jr. ofKnoxville, faced Dr. Robert Proffitt in the GOP primary.   The Democrats seeking the seat were former state RevenueCommissioner Dudley W. Taylor, professor of chemical engineeringRobert R. Scott, and political unknown John F. Bowen.   For the Senate, incumbent Democrat James R. Sasser Jr., seekinghis third six-year term, had no primary opposition. The three GOPhopefuls vying to challenge him in the Nov. 8 general election wereparty activist Alice Algood, lawyer Bill Andersen and lawyer HubertPatty.   In other Democratic primaries, Rep.

The mail fraud counts werevacated in line with a U.S. Supreme Court decision, and Blanton isappealing the extortion and conspiracy convictions.   The ex-governor, who left office in 1979 in a swirl ofcontroversy over the sale of pardons and liquor licenses, has saidthat he expects voters to realize that he was a victim of politicalpersecution in the FBI investigation.   ``They know I was railroaded and falsely accused,'' he said.   Five of the state's nine U.S. representatives had no primaryopposition. Two, Reps. Jim Cooper of the 4th District and BobClement of the 5th, also have no opponents in the Nov. 8 generalelection.   Others without primary opposition were Republican James Quillen,seeking his 13th two-year term from the 1st District; Democrat BartGordon of the 6th District; and Sundquis.   Democrat Sidney Smith, a retiree, was unopposed in his bid tochallenge Quillen. Chemical engineer Wallace Embry had no opponentsfor GOP nomination to take on Gordon.
