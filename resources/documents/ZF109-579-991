 Requires 50-micron to100-micron fiber-optic cable and ST connectors.andM;Executive SummaryandM;Test Environment: I tested TCNS in a five-node network running NetWare 286,NetWare 386, and LAN Manager 2.0.andP;  Workstations used ISA bus TCNS cards andwere Alternative Services 386/20s and Everex NextStep 386/16s.andP;  An Everex wasalso used as the server.andP;  I used the fiber Thomas-Conrad supplied as well asmy own.andM;Installation: Card installation is straightforward and quick.andP;  Custom fibercabling requires training and special cable tooling.andP;  Hub installation isstraightforward.andP;  Except for the fiber aspect, installing TCNS is as easy asinstalling Arcnet.andP;  Custom cable is available from Thomas-Conrad.andM;Ease of Use: Uses existing Arcnet drivers.andP;  Extremely fast.andM;Documentation: Thorough.andP;  Network card documentation explains all switchsettings and hardware configuration options.andP;  Hub documentation explainsconnections, usage, network layout limitations, and configurationsuggestions.andP;  Both explain TCNS theory and troubleshooting.andP;  OnlyNetWare-oriented installation information is included.andM;Robustness/Compatibility: Works with most Arcnet drivers.andP;  Not compatiblewith any other fiber optic network.andP;  Certain Novell shells, includingXMSNET3.COM and EMSNET.3COM, did not work.andP;  Otherwise no software or hardwareincompatibilities with MS-DOS, NetWare, or LAN Manager emerged.andM;Usefulness: Good for networks that need extremely high I/O throughput butcan't affor the more expensive standards-based FDDI.andM;Network interface card makers pay dear attention to performance.andP;  So donetwork designers and administrators.andP;  But instead of trying to eke the lastbyte out of current network access-method protocols, Thomas-Conrad took theroad less traveled.andP;  It uses an off-the-shelf protocol interface--Arcnet--toincrease the transport speed of its TCNS to 125Mbps.andP;  At this speed,Thomas-Conrad's fiber-optic TCNS achieves the highest network throughputcurrently attainable in microcomputerbased client-server architectures.andP;  TCNSis blisteringly fast.andM;TCNS makes high-speed fiberoptic networks affordable to the average networkinstallation.andP;  TCNS can be purchased for under $2,000 per adapter and lessthan $2,500 per hub.andP;  Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDIe, ANSI'sstandard for 100Mbps fiber networks, is far more expensive--viable for thosewith large MIS budgets.andP;  FDDI adapters for PCs are $4,000 and up.andP;  For thoseapplications that require huge bandwith, such as imaging or connections todatabase servers, TCNS is a good choice.andM;Arcnet CompatibilityandM;Although TCNS is a proprietary network and not plug-compatible with anyvendor's fiber-based Arcnet or any other network, it can use any Arcnetdriver.andP;  Using standard drivers somewhat offsets the risk of buying aproprietary technology.andP;  TCNS worked with the three Arcnet drivers I tried:Novell's RXNet, Standard Microsystems (SMC), and Thomas-Conradhigh-performance drivers.andM;TCNS uses a token-passing protocol and a half-duplex transmission, whereasArcnet employs a token-passing protocol and a full-duplex transmission.andO;Half-duplex transmission does not send a reflected character for eachcharacter transmitted, whereas full duplex does.andM;Like Arcnet, TCNS accomodates up to 255 nodes and a 20,000 feet maximumend-to-end distance on a single network.andP;  Some network operating systemsallow more than one LAN to be loaded in a single file server.andP;  The maximumcurrent configuration possible, which is under NetWare 386, is 2,034 nodescabled within a seven mile radius, more than 30 miles total.andM;Each TCNS network interface card is connected to a fiber-optic hub by twocables: one transmit and one receive.andP;  Each hub connects eight machines.andP;  Toconnect more than eight workstations requires daisy-chaining the hubs with apair of cables, much like Arcnet.andM;Instead of copper connections, a Hewlett-Packard infrated spectrumtransmitter and receiver connect each end of a fiber cable pair.andP;  TheHewlett-Packard optical specification allows fiber cable between 50 and 100microns thick.andP;  I mixed 62.5-micron cable from Thomas-Conrad with my own62.5-micron cable.andP;  Thicker cable decreases attenuation of the signal, but Idid not test that aspect.andP;  The TCNS manual warns installers not to point livefibers directly to their eyes, since the intense infrated light transmittedthrough the fibers could damage unprotected eyes.andP;  (So I didn't.)andM;Easy InstallationandM;I received five 16-bit ISA bus, full-length TCNS interface cards for thetest.andP;  Installing them in the workstations and servers was as easy as anyother network card.andP;  Because the ST fiber connectors on the board stick outof the back of the card, and the card doesn't have a chamfer (or &quot;cut-out&quot;)on the opposite edge, some muscle may be needed on the installer's part tobend the computer's backplane slightly until the card drops into place.andO;Overall, though, installing the cards was easy.andM;Thomas-Conrad can supply connectorized fiber-optic cables in 20-foot lengths.andO;The ST fiber connectors are similar to Ethernet's BNC connectors in that theyboth use a bayonette mount.andP;  I used four cable sets from Thomas-Conrad, andbuilt a fifth, unpolished cable set myself to see if sloppy cables caused anyattenuation.andP;  Although not a scientific test, the unpolished cables workedfine.andM;The cables are attached to the TC3050 SmartHub.andP;  The SmartHub is intelligentand can be connected to a workstation-based Thomas-Conrad SmartHub Monitorcard via telephone-style cable.andP;  Even without the monitoring hardware andconnection, the hub still supplies a good deal of information to monitor thetopology.andP;  The hub tracks major reconfigurations, such as devices entering,leaving, or disrupting the TCNS logical ring, and individual connections'status and activity (see Table 1).andM;Screaming PerformanceandM;The speed of TCNS depends heavily on the hardware and software architectureof its host computer.andP;  I tested TCNS with three operating systems: NetWare386 version 3.0, NetWare SFT 286 version 2.15a, and Microsoft LAN Managerversion 2.0.andP;  Each network operating system had its influence on throughput,but the machine's architecture and shell changes had the most dramaticeffects on performance (see Table 2).andM;Version 2.2 of Thomas-Conrad's high-performance driver running under NetWarewas the fastest.andP;  I used an SMC driver for a LAN Manager 2.0 network.andP;  Theperformance measured wasn't quite as spectacular as with NetWare, but stillit was very good.andP;  I was able to load Presentation Manager from a LAN Managerfile server in a little more than nine seconds.andP;  The lower numbers wereprobably a function of using a &quot;generic&quot; Arcnet driver, rather than afunction of the network operating system speed.andM;As much as I tried, however, Novell's PERFORM2 could only clock 1.55MB persecond.andP;  Using PERFORM2, I gauged TCNS' performance using reads in an overlaymode to minimize disk activity.andP;  With the packet size ranging from 1 byte to4,096 bytes, I chose the PERFORM2 maximum packet size.andP;  I performed each testfor PERFORM2's maximum of 1,000 iterations.andP;  My Novell NE-1000 Ethernet couldonly muster up 244Kbps under the same conditions--no other file serveractivities, minimum NetWare Loadable Modules (NLMs) running, and no otherattached workstations--making TCNS an amazing 729 percent faster than theNE-1000.andM;When I logged on additional TCNS workstations only the constant, unrelentingI/O activity of copying 4MB files in a loop caused an occasional slight sagin performance.andM;One caveat: I only tested five TCNS cards.andP;  In this case, five workstationsis simply not enough to generate sufficient traffic to choke the network, asI have done easily with five workstations on an Ethernet.andM;Computer bus speed was the single strongest influence on throughput.andP;  In thestandard workstation, an Alternative Services 386/20 computer, a change froma 6MHz to a 12MHz bus speed doubled throughput.andP;  To see if a faster-busedmachine would further increase throughput, I used an Everex NextStep 386.andO;The NextStep's 16MHz bus showed the improvement I sought.andM;When I used another NextStep as a file server, throughput took off.andP;  Thedifferences, as shown in Table 2, are profound: The differential inthroughput represents the maximum aggregate theoretical bandwidths of severalArcnets.andM;Different network shells and protocol drivers were used under NetWare 386version 3.0; they represent the second strongest influence on performance.andO;The fastest shell was Novell's NETX.COM.andP;  Novell's XMSNET3 shell cutperformance by nearly half, probably because XMSNET3 is a newer shell.andP;  Also,XMSNET3 switches data back and forth from the memory map below 640KB to1024KB; that overhead is time-consuming.andM;I was able to squeeze a bit more data through TCNS by playing with DOSCONFIG.SYS files, removing terminate-and-stay resident programs and unloadingother networks from the file server.andP;  These same tricks squeeze more datafrom any LAN, but the effect is more dramatic with TCNS because of itstremendous throughput.andM;I became engrossed with optimizing throughput.andP;  Small tricks paid off withhealthy rewards.andP;  Fine-tuning TCNS becomes an end in itself and maybe evendistracting from day-to-day system usage.andM;When using Novell's EMSNET3, I discovered that the TCNS IPX protocol wasincompatible with the Quarterdeck's expanded memory manager, QEMM, 2.2.andO;Other Arcnet drivers worked with QEMM, however.andM;Performance Technology (San Antonio, Texas) has licensed TCNS to be coupledwith its PowerLAN network operating system.andP;  PowerLAN's spartan overhead,when compared with Novell's NetWare and Microsoft's LAN Manager, may soon bethe fastest TCNS configuration.andP;  This software was not available during myreview, however.andM;Subjective QualitiesandM;The speed of TCNS is breathtaking.andP;  Imagine loading Microsoft Windows 3.0 instandard mode with SMARTDRIVE=OFF from a network in four seconds.andP;  Thinkabout loading Ventura Publisheer 2.0 with Professional Extensions in sixseconds.andP;  Or loading Lotus 2.01 nearly as fast as you can press the [is lessthan]ENTER[IS GREATER THAN] KEY.andP;  If you're really jaded, you may appreciatethe merits of a large-model Microsoft C 5.1 compile, link to an executable,and back to a &quot;HELLO.C&quot; in four seconds.andM;TCNS is fast enough to show when I/O time is spent in an application and todemonstrate where CPU crunch is done.andP;  It's capable of beating up hard disks.andO;TCNS removes a lot of the jerkiness associated with waiting for hard disks torespond and network I/O to finish.andP;  TCNS has the same addicting qualities asthe fastest computer you've ever worked on.andP;  Once you become accustomed tothe response, everything else makes you anticipate.andM;But Thomas-Conrad may not have what is probably the fastest microbasedprotocol for long.andP;  Thomas-Conrad's head start makes it a target for othernetwork vendors.andP;  Although the TCNS sets a baseline standard for fiber LANs,its features can be found in competitive products.andM;FDDI is emerging.andP;  SynOptics and ChipCom have shown 100Mbps transmissionsover copper cabling.andP;  That technology might allow TCNS to eventually run oncopper.andP;  TCNS really shines in its pricing.andP;  For those who can't affordexpensive FDDI adapters and hubs but need the bandwidth, TCNS is a goodchoice.andP;  The battle for fast, inexpensive networks is on, and for at least ashort while, Thomas-Conrad has the only sword.andM;Table 1: SmartHub CapabilitiesandM;Display  Description RECON COUNT  number of recons generated by node or hubPORT  currently displayed port RM ACT  on shows that hub is communicatingwith hub manager Port Status  off-port is enabled red-port is disabled withdisable/enable or software switch steady green-port is initiating recons morethan once per second blinking green-port is initiating less than once persecond ACTIVITY  red-activityandM;Tom Henderson is the principal of Corporate NEtworks, a network integratorbased in Indianapolis.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
