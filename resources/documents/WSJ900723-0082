But it's likely thewould-be unification chancellor will be spending more timeoff the sun deck and on the telephone grappling with knottyproblems brewing back home.   The move toward unity in December has been complicated byEast Germany's deepening economic crisis and predictions of a&quot;hot autumn&quot; of social unrest as thousands more East Germanslose their jobs every week. Then a prickly debate over themechanics of unification erupted into an open quarrel thathas rifted the coalition governments of both German capitals.</LP><TEXT>   The clash centers on whether Germany should be reunited onDec. 1, a day ahead of the all-German parlimentary electionsballot, or at midnight Dec. 2 after the polls close. If votesweren't at stake, it might be a minor point of procedure. Butprogress toward German unification has been hindered byold-fashioned party politics.   In Bonn, the Free Democrats, the centrist junior coalitionpartner of Mr. Kohl's center-right Christian Democratic Unionparty, have sided with the opposition Social Democrats indemanding that East Germany be absorbed into the FederalRepublic prior to the Dec. 2 elections.   Mr. Kohl's CDU wants to delay formal unification untiljust after the election to allow smaller parties in EastGermany to skirt West Germany's election rule that partiesget a minimum 5% of the popular vote to qualify forparliamentary representation. Although claiming that smallEast German parties should be given a fair shot in theirfirst run at the national polls, the CDU's critics assert theparty is catering to the tiny East German affiliate of theCDU's Bavarian sister party, the conservative ChristianSocial Union.   The Free Democrats, including Foreign MinisterHans-Dietrich Genscher, are rebelling. &quot;We don't want torepeat the mistake of the Weimar Republic,&quot; said a spokesmanfor the Free Democrats in Bonn, &quot;where governing was madenearly impossible by all the splinter parties in parliament.&quot;   East German parties are lining up behind their Bonncounterparts, dividing the East German government. PrimeMinister Lothar de Maiziere, head of the East German CDU,spent a rancorous Friday session in parliament fighting offstrong demands for pre-election unification from within hisown coalition, led by the East German Free Democrats. Theissue may have to be decided by a special parliamentary vote.   Once the timing issue is solved, the second state treatyfor political unity -- expected in September -- could besnagged by Mr. de Maiziere, who this time differs with Mr.Kohl over the Berlin question. Bonn hopes to defer overdeciding on Bonn or Berlin as Germany's future capital to adecision next year by the all-German parliament. Mr. deMaiziere insists that Berlin be set down as the futurecapital of a united Germany in the second state treaty. (Thefirst treaty covered July 1 monetary union.)   The dispute over details of unification, which is likelyto continue through September, hasn't obscured the suddentide of sobering news on East Germany's economy and therising cost of unity.   Even pessimistic economists are alarmed at the economicaftershocks from the July 1 merger of the two Germaneconomies. Unemployment is skyrocketing as the aftershockscontinue to shake down 40 years of stratified centralplanning. East German suppliers are collapsing under theonslaught of Western competition. The mass incursion ofWestern goods and services has all but swept East Germanproducts from their former markets, tearing huge gaps in thework force as former clients turn to Western suppliers.   &quot;Certain East German industry sectors are in desperateneed of help because they simply can't produce efficiently,particularly agriculture and consumer goods,&quot; said PeterDanylow, a German analyst for the Foundation for Sciences andPolicy outside of Munich. &quot;And if the trend continues, wecould well see an outburst of social unrest and another massmigration to the West,&quot; Mr. Danylow said.   East Berlin reported that 30% of East Germany's 8,000major companies already are insolvent and unable to pay wagesor purchase materials. By early July, about 223,000 of EastGermany's 8.5 million workers were already reported out ofwork and another 500,000 had been placed on shortened shiftsunder a special 2 billion mark (US$1.22 billion) compensationplan. East Germany estimates that unemployment rolls areswelling at a rate of between 30,000 and 40,000 a week.   &quot;We didn't expect the impact of monetary union would bethis bad, it's uncanny. Up to 40,000 more jobless every weekseems incredible,&quot; said a senior economist for one of thefive West German economic think tanks regularly advising theBonn government.   Spotty data make firm assessments difficult, the analystsaid. But the main problem is identified as the inability ofEast Germany's moribund industry to defend against theinvasion of Western goods and foodstuffs. &quot;That isparticularly disappointing,&quot; he said.   East German Finance Minister Walter Romberg sounded thealarm in an interview with Bonn's Die Welt newspaper lastweek, when he appealed to Bonn for closer cooperation in thecritical aftermath of monetary union.   &quot;I have the impression,&quot; Mr. Romberg said, &quot;that thedifficulty of some of the problems is underestimated by manypoliticians in the Federal Republic.&quot;   The Bonn government has agreed to East Berlin's request toincrease its 1990 quota on credit guarantees for East Germancompanies needing a quick cash infusion. Funds availableunder the facility were doubled to 8 billion marks from 4billion marks. Another 700 million marks in subsidies wasmade available to East Germany's badly mauled farm sector forthe months of July and August alone.   East Germany's industrial production dropped 15% in Junefrom a year ago, a pre-economic merger reading that isexpected to worsen in coming months as firms are swept asideby Western competitors.   While the West German economy is widely predicted toexpand between 3% and 4% next year, the German Institute forEconomic Research in West Berlin estimates that averagemonthly output in East Germany could slump by 20% beforerecovering in 1992 or 1993. Thus, economists predict,unemployment could reach two million or more next year asEast German firms drop workers to cut costs, or give up thefight.</TEXT></DOC>
