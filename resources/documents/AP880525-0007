More than 2,000 years ago, silk and spices made their way out ofChina on the route, while gold, silver and wool made their way in.   The commerce today is considerably more diverse, if not asexotic.   As many as 80 Pakistani merchants travel the road into Chinaeach day in battered buses to buy silk, porcelain and pearls, andChinese businessmen head in the opposite direction toward theKhunjerab Pass on the border as part of a barter arrangementbetween the two countries.   The barter enables the Chinese to trade hydroelectric equipment,farm tools, textiles, quilts and porcelain for Pakistanicigarettes, medical herbs, dried fruits, shoes and razor blades.   The volume of official barter has increased to the equivalent of$3 million in the past year, compared to $300,000 in 1986,according to Sadeq Malek, sales officer of Pakistan's NorthernAreas Traders Cooperatives.   The road also is being traveled more and more by tourists.   From Pakistan's border post of Sost the road follows the HunzaRiver, then runs along the icy Khunjerab River into China, crossingnumerous glaciers. As it climbs to the Khunjerab Pass, it goesthrough a series of narrow chasms and steep declines.   At Tashkargan, the first Chinese town across the border, workmenare building hotels and inns to accommodate the growing number oftravelers passing through.   Kamel Tahsin, manager of the government-run Pamir Hotel inTashkargan, said the new hotels will be more modern and betterequipped.   ``Business is getting better,'' he said. ``So we have to add acouple of wings to our hotel.''   Tahsin is one of about 12,000 people in Tashkargan who areShiite Moslem Tajiks, the tribe dominant in the area. They aredistinguishable by their sharp features and their women by theircolorful costume.   Across the border in Sost, Pakistanis also are building to meetthe growing flow of tourists.   Assif Khan, a Pakistani government tourist official, said bigtour groups now travel to China four times a month compared totwice a month a year ago.   But it's a tough road to travel, says Amanollah Mogul, the busdriver who makes the journey about once a day back and forth toChina.   The Khunjerab Pass, he said, makes him dizzy.</TEXT></DOC>
