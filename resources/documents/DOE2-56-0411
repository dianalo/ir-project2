<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-56-0411 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new conditional symbolic substitution rule for modified signed-digitarithmetic computation is introduced. Using this substitution rule, thenumbers to be added or subtracted are first replaced by a pair of newequivalent strings, which in a second step are then subject to anothersubstitution to generate both the addition or substitution result andits complement. For an optical implementation, a holographic content-addressablememory is used. Correspondingly, the input encoding, the logic reduction,and the optical-processing techniques are described. An optical isochronousarray processing method is proposed. An optical isochronous array-processor(OIAP) is a local regularly interconnected processing network that employsan array of identical processing elements. In an OIAP, incoming, isochronousdata are parallel processed in a fashion much like a propagating electromagneticwave front. For the various applications, the OIAP processing elementsand their interconnections can be different. In this paper, various all-opticalOIAP elements are considered. Applications ranging from optical binarynumber multiplication preprocessing to optical matrix algebra as wellas to optical residue arithmetic are presented. (KR)</TEXT></DOC>
