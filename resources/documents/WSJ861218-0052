IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/18/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> GENEVA, Switzerland  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iraq rejected Saudi Arabia's appeal to join a pact aimed at boosting oil prices, raising the strong possibility that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' meeting will end in failure.    Though senior OPEC delegates said that nearly all oil ministers have been told by their governments to remain until an agreement is reached, Iraq's refusal to commit to a plan, which would include production cuts, was seen as a threat to any real progress.    Plenary talks have been suspended since Monday, and none are scheduled for today. Still, &quot;Nobody is talking about leaving,&quot; said one minister, who asked not to be identified. &quot;The consequences are too frightening.&quot;    The accord, supported by OPEC's remaining 12 members, would cut the group's production about 7% from the current ceiling of about 17 million barrels a day. OPEC's goal is to boost oil prices to $18 a barrel from the current world-wide average of about $15 a barrel.    Iraq's rejection came in urgent talks between Saudi King Fahd and a special emissary from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose country has received an estimated $20 billion from the Saudis during its seven-year war with Iran. In addition, Saudi Arabia continues to supply Iraq with about 200,000 barrels a day of free oil.    Iraqi officials here explained that they can't accept OPEC's proposal to limit Iraqi production to about 1.4 million barrels a day in the next quarter, when the country expects to be able to produce as much as 2.3 million barrels a day by spring.    &quot;We aren't going to be trapped by a small quota. We are one of OPEC's biggest oil producers and have enormous oil reserves,&quot; a senior Iraqi official said.    The specter of failure, raised by Iraq's resolve and an insistence by Iran that no accord is possible without participation by all members, could send prices downward, many industry sources believe. &quot;If they don't agree, this would almost certainly lead to a fall of oil prices by $3 to $4 a barrel,&quot; said Brian Jakobovsky, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., who is observing the meeting.    Ministers said one possible solution to the impasse that is being contemplated is the exclusion of both Iraq and Iran from any accord on production quotas, though Iran has said it wouldn't accept this proposition.    Another hope, expressed by some ministers, is that Iraq will offer to suspend its deliberations in OPEC for as long as it excludes itself from a quota agreement. Some ministers said this may be acceptable to Tehran, which maintains that Iraq shouldn't hold OPEC membership without assuming its obligations.    Delegates said the private talks will continue today in an effort to seek a way out of the impasse.    Many delegates said the setback has severely weakened the position of the Saudis' new representative in OPEC, Hisham Nazer, acting oil minister and Saudi planning minister.    King Fahd fired Mr. Nazer's predecessor, Ahmed Zaki Yamani, in October and has made a higher oil price a cornerstone of his new oil policy. Mr. Nazer thus came into the talks with a sense of urgency and pressed his 12 colleagues to reach the production-cut agreement last Sunday. But as the talks enter their second week today, the Saudi position appears tattered.    The situation is made worse by the fact that Kuwait, usually a close ally of the Saudis, has done little to help out. Kuwaiti oil minister Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, a close friend of Mr. Yamani, is known to feel bitterness about the abrupt dismissal of his former colleague and to resent King Fahd's heavy-handed method of dictating oil policy to his close allies in the Gulf Cooperation Council. These include Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, all OPEC members.    Meanwhile, Swiss police have told OPEC that they may not be able to offer protection to the group beyond Dec. 19 because of the holiday season. OPEC may have to hire private guards. </TEXT></DOC>
