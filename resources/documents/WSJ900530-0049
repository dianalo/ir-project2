Jonathan S. Linen, currently a top executive at AmericanExpress Co., Shearson's parent, was named to the new positionat struggling Shearson; the move officially takes effect nextweek. The appointment by American Express was expected.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;You've got a great institution here with a lot of greatpeople who've been struggling in an environment {on WallStreet} that's a little bit debilitating, without a greatdeal of consumer confidence,&quot; Mr. Linen said in an interview.   He said it was too early to discuss if Shearson mightclose more than the 67 brokerage offices it already has thisyear, leaving 450. But Mr. Linen added: &quot;All bets are openright now.&quot;   Mr. Linen, 46 years old, was head of the traveler'schecks, direct marketing and publishing group of AmericanExpress Travel Related Services Co. At Shearson, he will havethe title of president and chief executive officer of thePrivate Client Group and asset management businesses.   Mr. Linen's appointment anticipates the planned split-upof Shearson into two halves: its brokerage network andmoney-management businesses that he will head, and itsinvestment banking and trading operations. The split-up ispart of American Express's efforts to reorganize and reviveShearson, which had an industry record loss of $915 millionin the first quarter because of retrenchment expenses.   After talking with many of Shearson's 10,000 brokersyesterday, Mr. Linen acknowledged that broker morale isn'tideal. &quot;My perception is, based on a day on the job, thatthings aren't settled down yet,&quot; he said. His goal: &quot;Makemoney and have fun.&quot;   Mr. Linen will report to Howard L. Clark Jr., a formerAmerican Express chief financial officer, who remainsShearson's chairman. Mr. Clark said in a statement that Mr.Linen's &quot;customer and quality driven management philosophywill find a receptive audience here at Shearson Lehman, as weall work to strengthen our position as a premier securitiesfirm.&quot;   Mr. Linen said that he has &quot;no illusions&quot; about his lackof brokerage-industry experience, but that hisconsumer-marketing experience will help him. Asked if he canhold his own with Shearson's independent-minded brokers. Mr.Linen said he thought he could. &quot;Try dealing with 1,500travel agents,&quot; he joked.   In his new post, Mr. Linen succeeds Hardwick Simmons, headof the Private Client Group, who resigned last week. Theasset-management businesses had been reporting to ShearsonVice Chairman Herbert Freiman, who remains head of Shearson'scapital-commitment committee.   American Express this year has shaken up Shearsonmanagement, pumped more than $1 billion into the brokeragefirm to replenish its capital base and announced plans toacquire the Shearson common stock that it doesn't alreadyown.</TEXT></DOC>
