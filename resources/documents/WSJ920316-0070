Several million dollars in debt after being cutloose from the Kremlin, the paper only a week and a half agohad cut back to three issues a week from six.   Pravda, which means &quot;truth,&quot; mirrored Moscow's policy inthe Cold War era. Circulation had once totaled 13 million,but recently had fallen to 1.5 million.   Editors of the independent paper blamed the suspension onthe new political climate and on Russia's economic reformsthat sent newsprint and distribution costs soaring. They saidthe government, which controls the presses, undermined Pravdaby demanding advance payment of two months' costs. Theeditors asserted that the republic wanted to silence Pravda,a rallying point for Communists opposed to President BorisYeltsin and his radical reforms.   The paper was trying to find loans to cover its debts andresume publishing.                                                                                                          CHINA ENDORSES PORT PROJECT                                                                                                          Beijing endorsed rapid development of a foreign-fundedport, reflecting China's new priority on economic reform.Kumagai Gumi Co. of Japan, a development firm, has sought fornearly four years to lease 18.6 square miles in Yangpu on thesouthern island province of Hainan for an unprecedentedforeign-controlled industrial park and port. The Yangpu andother projects were frozen after the 1989 pro-democracyuprising was quelled. The Yangpu development calls for anexport-oriented industrial zone, on which Kumagai Gumi's HongKong unit is to get a 70-year lease. Foreign businesses therewill be promised management freedom.                                                                                                          JAPAN'S NEW BUDGET APPROVED                                                                                                          Following weeks of struggle for a compromise on politicalreforms, Japan's Diet, or parliament, passed a 72.2 trillionyen ($538.18 billion) budget that will speed up public-worksspending to help stimulate the stagnating economy. Thespending plan for the year starting April 1 had been stalledover a bribery scandal, until the ruling Liberal DemocraticParty won opposition support for the compromise budget withpledges to clean up political corruption. The LDP also agreedto consider opposition proposals for increased spending onthe environment and social welfare, as well as tax cuts inlow-income brackets.                                                                                                          OBJECTIONS ABOUT U.S. TRADE                                                                                                          Australia, deriding trade based on politics and notcommerce, will lodge a complaint with the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade about U.S. pressure on Japan to buy U.S.car parts at the expense of other suppliers.   Canberra already has protested to Washington and Tokyo theplan for Japan to increase sharply its imports from the U.S.The plan amounts to &quot;managed trade and could harm ourexports,&quot; said an official in Australia, the fourth-largestexporter of cars and parts to Japan.   Separately, the European Community, worried about itsgrowing trade deficit with China, pressed Beijing to open itsmarkets to more international competition. EC officialsvisiting China said its discriminatory trade policiesunfairly favor the U.S., which Beijing has denied. The EC isChina's second-largest trading partner.   In Hong Kong, the colony estimated it could lose more than91 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$11.75 billion) in trade,HK$12 billion in revenue and 44,000 jobs if the U.S. fails torenew China's most-favored nation trading status. The HongKong and Chinese economy have grown increasingly integrated.                                                                                                          TOKYO UNVEILS IMPORT SPUR                                                                                                          To boost imports of manufactured goods, the Export-ImportBank of Japan unveiled a two-year credit line for firms thatplan to increase those imports 10% from year-earlier levels.The bank could provide 200 billion yen ($1.49 billion) ayear, with repayment over five years at 5.05% to 5.5%interest. The bank's previous import-promotion creditsfocused on capital goods, but the new program, part of theU.S.-Japan Global Partnership Action Plan, aims atintermediate and small goods.                                                                                                          UKRAINE CLEARS WAY FOR LOANS                                                                                                          Ukraine's agreement to shoulder with other republics theformer Soviet Union's estimated $89 billion in foreign debtmay convince Western nations to free millions of dollars ofcredits. Ukraine previously insisted on repaying only itsshare, about 16%, of the debt.   The Ukrainian government had balked at collectiveresponsibility for the debt, fearing getting stuck for agreater share if any member of the Commonwealth ofIndependent States defaulted.   At a CIS meeting in Moscow, Ukraine decided to sign lastyear's repayment pact that followed talks with the Group ofSeven industrialized nations. The G-7, except Canada, hasrefused to grant Ukraine badly needed credits unless itsigned.   Meanwhile, commercial bank lenders will keep a tight reinon CIS debt by extending a moratorium on principal paymentsin 90-day increments after March 31, Western financialsources said. Creditor governments may allow longerextensions as breathing room for lasting reforms.
