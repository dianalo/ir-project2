Fund for Drug Abuse Control,said in Tokyo. The amount of intercepted cocaine smuggledinto Japan in the first six months of 1990 was 137 pounds, upfrom only three pounds in the same period in 1989, Japanesepolice said.   &quot;The fact that such a large quantity of drugs was seizedin this country is evidence that there are alreadywell-constructed distribution networks here,&quot; Mr. di Gennarosaid.   Illegal drug use is still rare in Japan, and penalties aresevere. Sentences of life imprisonment are possible forcocaine and heroin trafficking.                                                                                                          BRAZIL'S ANTI-SMOKING CAMPAIGN                                                                                                          Brazil's Health Ministry said smoking would be prohibitedon domestic airline flights of two hours or less. The newrule will take effect after a public-education campaign bythe airlines and the Department of Civilian Aviation, theministry said. It said it also was considering creatingspecial shuttle flights for smokers. Three months ago, thegovernment approved a package of anti-smoking measuresincluding a ban on cigarette sales to minors and prohibitionof cigarette ads on television between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.                                                                                                          NO INTER-KOREAN TRAVEL   North Korea effectively rejected a South Korean proposalto open the Korean border to unrestricted travel for fivedays next week. By repeating its longstanding demand for therepeal of Seoul's anti-communist national security laws, theNorth appeared to have squelched any last-minute chance toset in motion the procedures to allow inter-Korean exchanges.The North also imposed two other conditions unlikely to bemet by South Korea: that the South allow a North Korean&quot;consolation&quot; team to visit jailed dissidents in the Southand that it permit South Korean dissidents to attend aunification rally at the border on Aug. 15.                                                                                                          CORRUPTION IN CHINA                                                                                                          China disciplined 17,000 government officials in the firsthalf of this year for corruption and other illegalactivities, an official report said. One-third of the 23,645cases of official wrongdoing filed from January through Juneinvolved bribery and embezzlement. Other cases involved&quot;violation of economic policies,&quot; profiteering, abuse ofpower for personal gain and dereliction of duty, the Xinhuanews agency reported. Most of those punished were localofficials, the report said.                                                                                                          MERCEDES-BENZES FOR TOKYO                                                                                                          Nissho Iwai Corp., a Japanese trading house, will set up awholly owned subsidiary within a month to sell Mercedes-Benzautomobiles in the Tokyo area, a company spokesman said.

Thenew subsidiary will have a showroom and a service shop incentral Tokyo.                                                                                                          VIETNAMESE BAN                                                                                                          Vietnam is banning cigarette imports because they drainforeign exchange and hurt the local industry, the officialVietnam News Agency reported. The order bans the import,circulation and consumption of foreign-made cigarettesstarting Oct. 1, the agency said. The report said diplomats,foreign businessmen and officials of internationalorganizations were exempt from the ban but must obtainpermits from the Ministry of Trade.

NEW ZEALAND CHAMPAGNE RULING                                                                                                          A New Zealand High Court judge has ruled that only winesproduced in the Champagne region of France can be labeled aschampagne for local sale.   The judgment was the result of a lawsuit brought by theComite Interprofessionel du Vin de Champagne, a Frenchchampagne producers' agency, against Wineworths Group Ltd., aNew Zealand liquor concern that distributes Australian winelabeled as champagne. The producers' agency was joined in thelawsuit by French companies Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin S.A.,Champagne Lanson Pere et Fils and Champagne Bollinger S.A.   Wineworths's defense of the lawsuit was funded by PenfoldsLtd., an Australian wine producer that markets Seaview brandwine under the champagne label.   The High Court ruled that &quot;champagne&quot; isn't a generic wordand that to sell wine produced other than in the Champagneregion of France under that name contravened New Zealand'sFair Trading Act.
