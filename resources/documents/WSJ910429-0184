Morgan andamp; Co. said it will no longer serveas a conduit for Americans to own shares in South Africancompanies, apparently in reaction to objections from somestates and municipalities that use the banking company as abond underwriter.   The decision to cease processing American DepositoryReceipts for several dozen South African companies came afterthe Massachusetts state government notified J.P. Morgan thatit was delaying naming a Morgan subsidiary as an underwriterof its bonds pending an evaluation of the bank's ADR role.</LP><TEXT>   Massachusetts had been reacting to a report earlier thismonth by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Unionthat J.P. Morgan's service, as related to South Africancompanies, was not in keeping with the U.S. government'santi-apartheid stand.   Morgan's decision clears the way for it to be consideredas one of the 26 co-managing underwriters being chosen for $2billion or more of Massachusetts state bonds over the nexttwo years, said Eric Turner, the state's deputy treasurer fordebt management.   &quot;It appears that any lingering concerns related to SouthAfrican involvement have ended,&quot; he said. A decision onadding Morgan, which Mr. Turner said had made an &quot;impressive&quot;presentation with its financing ideas, is expected to be madewithin the next few days.   Morgan's withhdrawal from South African company ADRs,&quot;means we made our case effectively,&quot; said Byron Rushing, aMassachusetts state legislator who urged Treasurer JosephMalone to look into the union's report. Boston City Councilmember David Scondras asked the same of his city's treasurer.   ADRs are issued by American banks and traded in the UnitedStates as proxies for shares in foreign companies. The bankskeep the records of ADR holders and process dividendpayments. J.P. Morgan is the largest distributor andprocessor of ADRs and most likely will sell or transfer itsSouth African ADR business to another bank. Over the past tenyears, the bank has served as senior manager or co-manager on61 deals that raised $3.6 billion for Massachusetts municipalissuers, according to a recent report in the Bond Buyer, afinancial newspaper.   Morgan's action is not likely to have any impact on SouthAfrica's economy, especially since the ADR activity did notrelate to any current capital raising efforts. In announcingFriday it would stop processing ADRs for South Africancompanies, J.P. Morgan said the ADRs represent shares thatexisted before America's 1986 South Africa sanctions and that&quot;We believe they do not facilitate new investment in SouthAfrica or in any way support apartheid.&quot; Nonetheless, &quot;Indeference to sincere and strongly held views,&quot; it said it waswithdrawing from the South African portion of its ADRbusiness.   Ironically, Morgan's decision comes at a time when overallcriticism of apartheid seems to be easing as South Africa ismoving to liberalize its racial policies. A Morgan spokesman,John Morris, confirmed that continuing processing ADRs forSouth Africa could have hurt the bank's municipalunderwriting business. Morgan was one of a few banks thatreceived expanded underwriting powers from the FederalReserve. &quot;A lot of municipalities put in grids of what willmake an acceptable underwriter,&quot; he said when asked if Morganhad received inquiries and objections to its South AfricanADR role.   Security Pacific Corp. had stopped processing ADRs forSouth African companies last year in reaction to objections,but a number of other leading banks such as Citicorp'sCitibank unit remain in the business. A Citibank spokesmansaid Friday the bank processes ADRs for a handful of SouthAfrica companies and &quot;We just don't believe it bolstersapartheid in any way.&quot; A spokesman for Bank of New York Co.'sBank of New York unit, which is one of the most activeprocessors of ADRs, was not available for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
