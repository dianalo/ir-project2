We have stopped beingcivil and silent,&quot; Ann Stone, leader of the group, Republicans for Choice,said to enthusiastic applause. &quot;We may continue to be somewhat civil, butwe're not going to be silent.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GOP INSURGENTS PLOT ABORTION-RIGHTS STRATEGYRENEGADES SEEK ROLE IN '92 CAMPAIGN  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     About 75 Republican officials and activists from across the nation met inAlexandria, a suburb of Washington, to begin organizing their crusade to electabortion-rights activists as delegates to the Republican National Conventionin Houston in August 1992.;    Issue could disrupt GOP; Their meeting signalsthe beginning of an internal confrontation that threatens to disruptRepublican politics over the next year by injecting the emotionally divisiveabortion issue directly into the heart of the party's decision-making.;   Since 1980, the Republican platform has included strict anti-abortion languageas official doctrine. The insurgent group wants the platform to recognizeabortion as a decision to be made by individuals, not the government.;    Anew urgency attends the issue, group leaders said, because the Supreme Courtseems inclined to overturn its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which recognizedabortion decisions as protected by a woman's right to privacy.;    The group'sleaders portrayed their cause as a matter of principle and conscience and as anecessary way to build their party's following, especially among youngvoters.;    The rebels' message;  &quot;The message we want to begin sendingthroughout this country is that you can believe in a strong national defenseand economic conservatism and lower taxes and free enterprise and freedom ofchoice,&quot; said Rep. Susan Molinari, R-N.Y.;    President Bush opposes abortion.The Republican abortion-rights activists insist that they support Bush but areintent upon electing pro-Bush delegates who are also dedicated to upholdingabortion rights.;    To do that, the insurgents may run &quot;favorite daughter&quot;abortion-rights candidates as alternatives to Bush in next year's Republicanprimaries, a high-risk ploy that could make abortion rights thehighest-profile issue in internal party politics at primary time.;    Stonesaid the favorite-daughter strategy is unlikely to be the group's preferrednational strategy.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ROBERT A.
