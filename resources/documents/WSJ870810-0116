The new procedures, which had been expected, closely parallel steps suggested a month ago by the top Democrat and top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sens. William Cohen (R., Maine) and David Boren (D., Okla.). Mr. Reagan was flanked by the two senators as he made his announcement, and he gave them a letter promising that he'll soon institute new internal procedures to ensure that his administration promptly reports covert actions to Congress.    But in remarks to reporters later, the senators were careful to describe the White House's new procedures as a &quot;first step&quot; toward remedying flaws Congress believes it spotted in investigating the Iran-Contra affair. &quot;While the president's letter is encouraging, final judgment must be withheld until appropriate action is taken by the president to actually implement these policies,&quot; Sen. Cohen said.    The lawmakers acknowledged that the moves by the White House may be insufficient to satisfy some other legislators who are suspicious of Reagan administration pledges in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair and are urging that tighter reporting requirements be written into the law governing covert actions.    Indeed, Rep. Louis Stokes (D., Ohio), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and other influential House members have proposed a bill to write similar changes in reporting procedures into the law. While the White House worked closely with the senators to develop its new procedures, it didn't deal extensively with these House members, and Rep. Stokes signaled that he will continue to push his legislation. &quot;Unilateral executive action can't fully establish key principles of Congressional oversight of intelligence,&quot; he said. &quot;Statutory overhaul is necessary.&quot;    Each of the new procedures announced by President Reagan is designed to prevent a recurrence of some steps taken during the Iran-Contra affair in which Congressional intelligence committees weren't notified of either the secret arms sales to Iran or the diversion of proceeds to Nicaraguan Contra rebels.    Existing laws require the White House to inform congressional intelligence committees or, in especially sensitive cases, a group of eight congressional leaders before covert actions begin. The law also says that, when there is a pressing need to do so, the president can delay notifying the committees until after an operation begins, but the law doesn't specify how long the delay can be.    The new administration procedures specify that &quot;in all but the most exceptional circumstances&quot; the White House will inform Congress about new covert operations within 48 hours after they begin. The procedures also say the intelligence committees will be told if covert operations involve the participation of &quot;private parties or other countries,&quot; a provision designed to ensure that future notifications will mention nongovernment participants such as the private arms merchants involved in the Iran-Contra affair.    The procedures also say that except in cases of extreme emergency, the president will make a written finding, or decision document, authorizing a covert action. In the case of the Iranian arms sale, one such presidential finding was made orally. The new procedures also require that such findings be made available to all members of the National Security Council -- meaning the vice president, secretaries of state and defense and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency.    That requirement is an attempt to avoid repeating the situation that existed during the Iranian arms sales, when neither Secretary of State George Shultz nor Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger were aware of some presidential orders authorizing the sales. Sen. Boren called the new requirement that all findings be made available to NSC members an &quot;anti-palace coup provision.&quot;    The provisions also say that findings shouldn't retroactively authorize actions already undertaken, as happened during the Iran-Contra affair. And the new procedures call for a regular and periodic review of existing covert actions by both the intelligence committees and the NSC. </TEXT></DOC>
