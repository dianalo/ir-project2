The Seattle-based aerospace company has agreed to enter the pleasin connection with obtaining two budget documents, said the sources,who spoke on condition of anonymity. Boeing's planned plea has beenwidely reported over the past week.   A court document states that Boeing, which was the Pentagon's10th-largest contractor with $3 billion worth of business last year,is scheduled to enter a pre-indictment plea Monday in U.S. DistrictCourt in Alexandria, Va.   According to another court filing, Boeing is an unindictedco-conspirator of Richard Lee Fowler, a former company marketinganalyst awaiting trial on charges of obtaining more than 100Pentagon documents between 1979 and 1985.   Many of the documents Fowler obtained were classified, accordingto the indictment.   Robert S. Bennett, Boeing's Washington attorney, declined tocomment on the case.   The documents Fowler, who worked as a civilian Air Force employeebefore joining Boeing, is accused of giving Boeing include materialon former President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.   Under the terms of the guilty plea being negotiated with Boeing,the Pentagon could still take steps to bar the company from futuredefense contracts, according to the sources.   The company has agreed to reimburse the government for the costof the investigation.   Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood said a decision onwhether to bar Boeing from bidding on future contracts would be madeas part of an administrative proceeding conducted by the Air Force.   ``It's not an automatic thing,'' he said. But a decision to debarBoeing would apply to all Pentagon procurement, not just Air Forcecontracts, he said.   Howard W. Cox, deputy assistant inspector general for the DefenseDepartment, said that if a contractor agrees to take adequatecorrective measures, ``there's a good chance the Air Force will nottake any action.''   Fowler, 64, of Springfield, Va. is to go on trial Dec. 4 oncharges of conspiracy, conveyance without authority, mail fraud andconversion of government property. He has declined to comment aboutthe case.   He is accused of obtaining detailed budget documents for variousDefense Department programs, including a five-year plan for thePentagon. Such material would help a defense company submit bids forgovernment contracts.   Prosecutors allege that while the indictment charges Folwer withobtaining 110 documents for Boeing, he procured more than 600classified documents for the defense contractor over the six-yearperiod.   In doing so, he was able to give Boeing ``a comprehensive pictureof the internal dynamics'' of the Defense Department's planning andbudgeting system, prosecutors say in court documents obtained by TheMorning News Tribune of Tacoma, Wash.   Court files contain a 1986 interview with Fowler by Boeingofficials as part of an internal inquiry conducted at the directionof the Defense Department.   Fowler said in the interview that he received calls from managersin various Boeing divisions asking him to get the Pentagon planningand budget documents.   Asked if he was pressured into obtaining them, Fowler replied,``No, that's what I was hired to do.''   In another statement, Fowler said he considered it an acceptedpractice throughout the defense industry to acquire such information.   Fowler was critical of the Pentagon's classification practices,saying that some papers were overclassified and others wereclassified for political rather than security reasons. Sometimesinformation would be classified in one document and unclassified inanother, he said.   ``I never consciously believed that the data extracted from DODdocuments, in spite of the classification, was in fact classified,nor would the data in any way compromise the security of thenation,'' he wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
