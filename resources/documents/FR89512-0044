L. 100-4, added section 309(g) to the Act to provide forthe assessment of administrative penalties. The statute established two``classes'' of administrative penalties, Class I and Class II. Class Iadministrative penalty proceedings are not subject to the AdministrativeProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, and assessments may not exceed $10,000per violation, or exceed a total amount of $25,000. Class II penalty proceedingsare subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, andassessments may not exceed $10,000 per day for each day during which theviolation continues, or exceed a total assessment of $125,000. Administrativepenalties may be assessed by the Secretary of the Army for violations ofany permit condition or limitation in a permit issued under section 404of the Act by the Secretary of the Army. Permits under section 404 areissued by the Corps of Engineers following the administrative regulationspublished in 33 CFR Parts 320 through 330. The regulation being proposedtoday provides only for the assessment of Class I penalties. Proceduresfor Class II administrative penalties are under development and will bepublished separately. The Army has promulgated regulations governing the procedures to be followedin pursuing enforcement for its regulatory responsibilities, includingenforcement or permit conditions and limitations, at 33 CFR Part 326. Theprocedural framework for Class I administrative penalties as proposed belowwould be added as a new section (33 CFR 326.6) in those regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Requirements </ITAG>A Class I penalty is assessed by the Secretary of the Army under section309(g) of the Act by an administrative order. Before issuing the order,the Secretary must provide the person to be assessed a Class I penaltya written notice of the proposal to issue the order, and the opportunityto request, within 30 days of the date the notice is received by the person,a hearing on the proposed order. Section 326.6(b)(2) of the proposed regulationaddresses this requirement. The hearing is not subject to the AdministrativeProcedures Act but must provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard andto present evidence. Sections 326.6(g), (h), and (i) of the proposed regulationwould codify the reuqirements and procedures for Class I penalty hearings.Under section 309(g)(1) of the Act, the Secretary must also consult withthe State in which the violation occurs prior to assessing the penalty.Sections 326.6(b)(4), and (d) discuss the requirement and the process tosatisfy the consultation requirement. Under section 309(g)(1) of the Act, the Secretary must provide public noticeand reasonable opportunity to comment upon the proposed assessment. Thesection also provides that if a hearing on the proposed assessment is conducted,the Secretary shall give any citizen who commented on the proposed assessmenta reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence at the hearing.The section further provides that the Secretary shall give any person whocomments on a proposed assessment, notice of the order assessing the penalty.Sections 326.6(b)(3), and (c) of the proposed regulation set forth thepublic notice requirement, format, and comment process to meet this requirementof the Act. Section 326.6(j)(7), and (8) provide further information onnotice requirements and rights to a hearing. Under section 309(g) of the Act, if no hearing is held, any person whocommented on the proposed assessment may petition the Secretary to setaside the order and to provide a hearing on the penalty. In addition, thesection also provides that the Secretary must set aside the order and providea hearing if the Secretary determines that the evidence presented by thepetitioner is material and was not considered in the issuance of the order.Under section 309(g), if the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretaryshall provide to the petitioner and publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, notice of the reasons for the denial. Sections326.6(j)(7), and (8), and andSection; 326.6(k)(iii) of the proposed regulationswould codify requirements related to hearing, public notice, comments onClass I penalty orders. Finally, section 309(g) of the Act provides that any person against whoma civil penalty is assessed may obtain review of such assessment by filingnotice of appeal in the proper court within 30 days of the date the penaltyorder was issued. Section 326.6(l) of the proposed regulation provide forthis judicial review. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note 1.</T4>_The Department of the Army has determined that the proposedregulations do not contain a major proposal requiring the preparation ofa regulatory impact analysis under E.O. 12291. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note 2.</T4>_The term ``he'' and its derivatives used in these regulationsis generic and should be considered as applying to both male and female.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 326 </ITAG>Investigations, Intergovernmental relations, Law enforcement, Navigation,Water pollution control, Waterways. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Approved:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John S.
