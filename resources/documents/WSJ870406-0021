Sale terms weren't disclosed.    The railroad and truck transportation company doesn't know in which quarter it will take the one-time, after-tax charge as that depends on when the transaction closes, a spokesman said. But the sale isn't expected to be completed before mid-summer, the company said.    For 1986, Soo Line posted a $43.3 million loss on revenue of $631.8 million. The loss included an $82 million pre-tax restructuring charge and a $9.7 million gain from a building sale.    Lake States operates about 2,000 miles of railroad in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois. Wisconsin Central is a new company formed by a group of Chicago businessmen to acquire Lake States. Wisconsin Central's president is Edward A. Burkhardt, a former senior officer with Chicago Northwestern Transportation Co., a unit of CNW Corp. Richard B. Ogilvie, a former Illinois governor, is one of its financial backers. </TEXT></DOC>
