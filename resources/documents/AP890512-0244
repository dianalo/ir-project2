This week, Glendale Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, a solidthrift and one of the nation's five largest, became GlendaleFederal Bank. Its federal insurance is unchanged; indeed, verylittle will change except signs and stationery.   But at a time when one-third of U.S. thrifts are expected to betaken over by the federal government to avert failure, managementsees solid advantage in disassociating itself from the weak part ofthe industry.   ``Using the word `bank' conveys a solid image consistent withour reputation,'' said Norman M. Coulson, Glendale Federal'schairman and chief executive.   ``You may think this is sort of in the Mickey Mouse category,but from a marketing point of view it has value,'' said PeterTreadway, an analyst at Smith Barney, Upham Harris andamp; Co. in NewYork. ``I think John Q. Public may slightly be more reassured.''   Perception is no small matter.   The government reported Thursday that savers nationwide withdrew$8.5 billion from the nation's thrifts in March, even though thevast majority of those deposits are fully covered by federalinsurance.   Thrift executives discussing the matter generally say worriesabout the industry's image are a secondary reason for the change.   They say the main motive is that Sandamp;Ls are striving now tocompete with commercial banks, offering consumer services likechecking accounts and car loans, and it's believed that most peoplethink such services come from banks rather than thrifts.   For the institution, the switch requires little effort. It mustpersuade the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to shift it from asavings and loan charter to the virtually identical savings bankcharter.   Such a switch leaves the institution in the Federal Savings andamp;Loan Insurance Corp., which is essentially insolvent and the targetof President Bush's hotly debated rescue proposal.   Some thrifts have sought to move to the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., the stronger fund that insures banks, but Congresshas slapped a moratorium on such moves in an effort to preserve theFSLIC.   Twelve Sandamp;Ls in California, Arizona and Nevada have receivedapproval to adopt the bank name since the start of 1988, accordingto a list provided by the Bank Board's regional office in SanFrancisco.   Elsewhere in the country, many others have applied for suchchanges, said Bank Board spokesman Bill Fulwider in Washington. Hewas unable to provide an exact number.   Among the California Sandamp;Ls adopting the bank name was AmericanSavings, the biggest thrift ever seized by federal regulators.</TEXT></DOC>
