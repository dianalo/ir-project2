Yeltsin saidTuesday he and Mikhail S. Gorbachev have agreed to discuss theirdifferences.   Yeltsin, the Russian president, declined to say who proposed themeeting scheduled for Sunday, but it was the Soviet president whoapproached Yeltsin to shake his hand after a holiday ceremony inthe Kremlin's Palace of Congresses.   ``We just agreed with Gorbachev to meet on the 11thone-on-one,'' Yeltsin said. ``There will be very many issues and itwill be an important meeting,'' he said, declining to elaborate.   The meeting will be the first between the rival politicianssince their attempt at reconciliation over economic reform brokedown in late summer. The rift put Yeltsin's Russian Federation, theSoviet Union's largest republic, on a collision course with thecentral government.   Russia adopted its own plan for converting to a free marketeconomy, conflicting with a more cautious plan endorsed byGorbachev and adopted by the national legislature.   Gorbachev appeared to have been motivated to suggest thepeacemaking session by a speech at the Revolution Day gala in thecongress hall. Leonid Y. Bliznov, a Soviet legislator, notedGorbachev and Yeltsin had tried to work together but ``now, verylittle is left of this alliance.''   ``It's incomprehensible who or what stands in the way of the twoleaders, who know the people's needs and whom the people recognize.Both of them must realize that future opposition makes them bothless popular,'' Bliznov told the audience of more than 3,000Communist Party officials and politicians.   As applause erupted in the huge, wood-paneled hall, Gorbachevturned to look at Yeltsin, seated six people to his left on a longpodium in front of a huge portrait of Soviet founder VladimirLenin. Yeltsin did not turn to make eye contact.   Yeltsin told reporters later that he would make a speech in afew weeks explaining his differences with Gorbachev.   The Kremlin ceremony amounted to a pep rally for Communists, whoare expected to face criticism from dozens of groups on Wednesday.   A traditional military parade, followed by a speech byGorbachev, is scheduled for Red Square to celebrate the revolutionthat brought Bolsheviks to power in 1917. Yeltsin was invited tostand atop the Lenin Mausoleum along with Gorbachev and otherofficials.   At least two anti-Communist groups plan marches in Moscow. Somedemonstrators urge a ``day of mourning'' be held for victims ofseven decades of totalitarian rule. Some have vowed to marchthrough Red Square demanding the resignation of Gorbachev and theSoviet parliament.   Yeltsin, who has quit the Communist Party, said Soviets shoulduse the holiday as a time for reflection: ``People must again lookback and pay tribute to what the revolution did and analyze whatthe mistakes were during that period.''   ``The biggest mistake was turning things over to a totalitarianregime,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
