The latest sales, involving insolvent Sandamp;Ls in Montana andOklahoma, were announced at mid-day as the three-member Federal HomeLoan Bank Board continued to meet behind closed doors reviewingapplications to take over failed institutions.   Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall scheduled a late afternoonpress conference to announce further agreements and to answercharges raised by critics that many of the multimillion-dollarbailouts represented bad deals for the government.   Critics have complained that in its rush to complete sales beforemidnight Saturday, when tax breaks for buyers will be cut in half,the bank board failed to drive the best bargains possible.   The latest acquisitions involved the sale of the insolventCommunity Federal Savings and Loan Association of Tulsa, Okla., tothe Local Federal Savings and Loan Association of Oklahoma City. Theagreement was te first acquisition under the bank board's OklahomaPlan, providing for accelerated review of cases in that state. Thegovernment pledged assistance of $89 million and Local Federalagreed to invest $16 million in cash.   In the other deal, the insolvent Great Falls Federal Savings andLoan Association of Great Falls, Mont., was taken over by WesternSavings and Loan Association of Missoula, Mont. The agreement, inwhich the government pledged $11.4 million in assistance, resolvedthe final insolvent Sandamp;L in Montana.   The 199 insolvent Sandamp;Ls which have been closed compared to 48closed in 1987 and would be the highest figure since 277 Sandamp;Ls failedin 1938, during the Depression.   The bank board for the first time has drawn foreign investorsinto its effort to bail out sick Sandamp;Ls in the Southwest. It announceda subsidiary of a Taiwanese company had agreed to buy eightinsolvent Texas savings institutions.   Bank board chairman M. Danny Wall defended the sale of the Texasthrifts to Taiwanese investors, saying, ``We welcome our firstnon-U.S. owned investor ... Their interest in investing in thefuture of Texas is a further indication of the attractiveness of thestate's thrift industry as well as its business climate.''   Working against a midnight Saturday deadline, the bank boardannounced the sale of 13 more insolvent Sandamp;Ls in Texas and Illinoislate Thursday.   All of the institutions will be open for business as usual today,sporting new names and with their depositors' funds fully protected.   Even with the year-end rush of closings, there are still morethan 400 insolvent Sandamp;Ls operating, and estimates of cleaning up thetotal mess range as high as $112 billion.   The amount of money needed presents an immediate problem for theincoming Bush administration.   President-elect Bush is faced with the task of coming up with asolution to the Sandamp;L crisis that will not make it impossible for himto meet his campaign pledge of narrowing the federal budget deficitwithout resorting to higher taxes.   Many congressional critics believe that the bank board's effortsare going in the wrong direction and will worsen not narrow theultimate cost to the government.   Wall has insisted that the cost of simply closing theinstitutions and paying off depositors would far exceed the saleswhich are being arranged through the use of tax breaks and directfederal assistance as a lure to buyers.   The tax benefits to Sandamp;L buyers will be effectively cut in halfafter midnight Saturday. The provisions that will expire allow firmspurchasing failed Sandamp;Ls to deduct the previous losses of thoseassociations from profits the firms earned on other operations.   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, the new chairman of the HouseBanking Committee, said he plans to hold a series of hearingsstarting in January on the deals, looking specifically at the twolargest bailouts announced this week.   Those complex transactions will cost the government $6.8 billionin assistance to the purchasers of American Savings of Stockton,Calif., by Texas billionaire Robert Bass and the acquisition of fivedeeply troubled Texas Sandamp;Ls by Revlon cosmetics chairman RonaldPerelman.   The Sandamp;Ls which were closed on Thursday included one institutionin Springfield, Ill., and 12 insolvent Sandamp;Ls in Texas which werepurchased by two separate groups of investors, including the firstsale of Texas institutions to foreigners.   The details of the transactions were:   _Eight insolvent Texas Sandamp;Ls were sold to Pacific USA HoldingsCorp., a Texas subsidiary of Pacific Electric Wire and Cable Co. ofTaiwan, which agreed to invest $37.5 million. The branches will beoperated under the name Pacific Southwest Savings Bank F.S.B.,headquartered in Corpus Christi.
