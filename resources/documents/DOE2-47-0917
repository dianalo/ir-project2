<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-0917 </DOCNO><TEXT>An attempt was undertaken to develop animal bioassays for the purposeof evaluating the potency of airborne chemical irritants and predictingthe safe-exposure limits or threshold-limit values (TLVs) for workersin industrial settings. A series of 11 industrial chemicals was selectedto aid in developing the first bioassay. The model was then extendedto include a series of weak sensory irritants and predict TLVs for thesecompounds. The model was then extended to include alkylbenzenes, mixturesof formaldehyde and acrolein and mixtures of acrolein and sulfur dioxide.Through a second bioassay, the possibility of pulmonary hypersensitivitywas recognized by using toluene-diisocyanate as the model chemical. Thismodel gave rise to the first demonstration of hapten specific respiratoryhypersensitivity in an animal model and can be used to investigate otherchemicals suspected of inducing immediate pulmonary hypersensitivityin exposed workers. To evaluate pulmonary irritation from airborne industrialchemicals a third bioassay was developed. A fourth bioassay was developedto evaluate whether airborne chemical irritants would interact with DNAin cells of the respiratory tract as well as in cells of other organs.</TEXT></DOC>
