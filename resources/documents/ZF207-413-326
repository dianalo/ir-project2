(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Dave MethvinandM;and David StromandM;With its new 486/25 Power Platform, IBM has traded its conservative bluepinstripes for the latest in Parnelli Jones racing gear.andM;Announced last month at PC Expo, the 486/25 Power Platform is a high-speedupgrade board that snaps into the motherboard of IBM's Model 70 A21.andP;  The$3,995 upgrade will be available by the end of the year.andM;Based on a series of recent benchmark tests performed by PC Week, the 486/25Power Platform is indeed the fastest IBM PS/2 to date, and may well brightenthe lives of power PC users who have already pushed their 386s to the limit.andM;Tests showed that the 486/25 Power Platform handily beat Compaq ComputerCorp.'s 33MHz 386 machine and IBM's Model 70 A21 without the Power Platformupgrade, running as much as twice as fast as both machines in some of thetests.andM;An 8-bit data path for video data, however, hampered the IBM hardware'sability to display graphics.andP;  The Compaq machine, with Compaq's custom 16-bitvideo implementation, ran our graphics benchmark tests roughly twice as fastas the Power Platform.andM;In the era of the 486, times are changing.andP;  So quick was the 486 processorthat some benchmarks ran too fast to be timed in a meaningful way.andP;  The Lotusspreadsheet recalculation test, for example, was so fast that for allpractical purposes its speed could not be measured.andP;  As a result, we modifiedthe test to execute a macro 20 consecutive times.andP;  Even then, we got a resultof 0.3 seconds for a single recalculation.andP;  This was more than twice thespeed of the Compaq machine.andM;Not surprisingly, operations involving raw CPU power received the biggestboost.andP;  The CPU sort benchmark came in at almost half the time of the 25MHz386 Model 70 and about a third faster than Compaq's Deskpro 386/33 PC.andP;  Thetest was designed to sort integers, thereby highlighting main CPUperformance.andM;Floating-point operations produced an even wider spread, showing off thepower of the built-in math coprocessor in the 486 chip set.andP;  The 486's bigpayback for coprocessing is that math instructions can execute simultaneouslywith standard CPU instructions.andM;However, as the video tests proved, speed isn't everything.andP;  We also tested avariety of applications software to determine compatibility.andP;  As would beexpected, standards such as DOS 3.3 worked flawlessly.andM;To test 386-specific compatibility, we tried to load 386-to-the-Max, a386-specific memory-management utility from Qualitas Inc. of Silver Spring,Md.andM;During system boot, the system hung up and had to be restarted by the BRS(Big Red Switch) method.andP;  This may have been due to an early revision of the486 chip.andP;  IBM couldn't explain the problem, but an IBM spokesman said, &quot;If[the software] works on your 70 A21, we will do everything we can to makesure it continues to work on the 486.&quot;andM;Where could a mighty machine such as this find a productive home?andP;  Two clearapplication areas are LAN servers and high-power workstations, but the PowerPlatform has some troubling weaknesses that may limit its performance inthose arenas.andM;From the Model 70 form factor the Power Platform inherits a small desktoppackage with only three expansion slots, which will fill up quickly as themachine is configured to complement its 486 processor.andP;  If used as anengineering-design workstation, a high-resolution video board like the 8514/Awill take up a slot.andP;  Another slot is needed for a LAN interface card.andP;  Iflarge-capacity hard disks or 5-1/4-inch floppy drives are required, they willhave to be mounted externally, using one or more slots.andM;Despite these drawbacks, the fact remains: If IBM can deliver this machine onschedule, it may lose its reputation as a safe, conservative company, andwill provide a powerful machine to boot.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
