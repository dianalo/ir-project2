The NRA charges that Gov. Andrus is the &quot;lap dog&quot; and &quot;puppet&quot; of the national gun-control movement, and a kind of fifth columnist who is a threat to every gun owner in the nation. Gov. Andrus retorts that the NRA leaders are nothing but a bunch of &quot;three-piece-suit boys&quot; who know little about the outdoors and have little in common with typical Western hunters and gun owners.    This brouhaha, colorful as it is, would have little significance outside of Idaho if it did not reflect some of the larger problems facing the NRA as it is challenged both by gun-control advocates and a handful of more hard-line gun advocates. Some critics of this feared, Washington-based gun-owners organization and lobbying group have even charged that the NRA is losing membership and political clout as a result of its efforts to maintain the middle ground between gun-control advocates and more militant gun owners.    Nothing is more sacred in the isolated realms of the rural West than gun ownership and hunting rights. And Idaho, with its small population, spectacular forests and mountain ranges, is one of the last hunters' paradises, at least in the lower 48 states. With a population of little more than one million, Idaho this year issued a remarkable 165,000 resident hunting licenses.    Gov. Andrus, like any astute politician in these parts, makes much of the fact that he is a devoted hunter. This fall, he bagged a mountain goat and an elk, and he has garnered publicity in the course of his recreation.    All of this irks the NRA no end. Its feud with Mr. Andrus dates to his tenure as secretary of the interior in the Carter administration when, among other policies opposed by the NRA, he supported creation of Alaska's Wrangel-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. Hunting is barred in national parks and preserves, and the NRA says Mr. Andrus closed down some of the finest hunting country in Alaska.    When Mr. Andrus ran to regain the Idaho governorship in 1986, the NRA saw an opportunity to even an old score. The organization sent a questionnaire to Mr. Andrus and his opponent, David Leroy, asking their stance on a wide range of gun-related issues. Mr. Leroy answered all the NRA's questions satisfactorily. But Mr. Andrus failed to measure up on three of the 18 questions. He supported a 72-hour waiting period between the purchase and delivery of some firearms -- described as &quot;Saturday Night Specials&quot; by Mr. Andrus -- in order to allow police to conduct a background check of the gun purchaser. He opposed a proposal for legislation seeking mandatory issuance of concealed-weapon permits to law-abiding citizens. And he indicated indirectly he would support a ban on what he described as &quot;military type hardware and armament.&quot;    A small group of Idaho gun advocates evaluated Mr. Andrus's response and rated him a &quot;D.&quot; Brian Judy, NRA state liaison for Idaho, later raised the rating to &quot;C-minus,&quot; but it was still a failing grade.    Late in the campaign, the NRA ran a full-page ad in Idaho newspapers calling on &quot;The Real Cecil Andrus&quot; to &quot;Please Stand Up.&quot; The ad included a letter noting that Mr. Andrus's opponent, David Leroy, who rated an &quot;A&quot; on the questionnaire, was clearly the choice for Idaho voters. On the other hand, the NRA ad said, Mr. Andrus &quot;is or has been involved with or has assumed a leadership role&quot; in a number of environmental organizations, which the NRA labeled &quot;anti-hunting/anti-gun.&quot;    In the last month of the campaign, Mr. Andrus's lead dwindled, and he won reelection by fewer than 4,000 votes. &quot;Yeah, they had an impact,&quot; he admitted.    After the campaign the NRA sent a peace-seeking letter congratulating Mr. Andrus on his victory and hoping for &quot;a good working relationship.&quot; Mr. Andrus scrawled, &quot;You have to be kidding!&quot; across the bottom and sent it back.    Since then the feud has deepened. Mr. Andrus frequently has aimed pointed remarks at the NRA and continues to publicize positions opposed to the group. The NRA in turn has made no secret of its hopes that this will be Mr. Andrus's last term.    One issue in the feud involves a statement Mr. Andrus made recently opposing legalization of machine-gun ownership, which is supported by the NRA. &quot;We do not need fully automatic weapons and plastic explosives to hunt deer and elk in Idaho,&quot; he explained. With regard to his opposition to armor-piercing bullets, which also are supported by the NRA, he noted that on his recent hunt he found that the animals were not wearing bulletproof vests. In general, Mr. Andrus said, his views represent the mainstream among Westerners and hunters.    The NRA responded with its &quot;lap dog for the national gun-control movement&quot; letter and accuses Mr. Andrus of misrepresenting the group's positions. &quot;He either doesn't understand the issues or he is distorting them,&quot; said Wayne Lapierre, executive director of the NRA's Washington lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action.    Mr. Andrus noted that the NRA used to support a waiting period for handguns and that its partisan approach to politics and increasingly hard-line stances on gun issues have &quot;run a lot of people out of the NRA.&quot;    Barbara Lautman, director of communications for Handgun Control Inc., the arch-nemesis of the NRA, said that the Idaho situation illustrates the challenges that the NRA faces nationally. &quot;Generally what is happening, not just in Idaho, is that the NRA leadership is getting more extreme,&quot; Ms. Lautman said. She claims, for instance, that the NRA made repeal of restrictions on machine-gun ownership a high priority last year after more hard-line gun-owners' organizations championed the cause of machine-gun owners.    At the same time and despite the NRA's move to the right, Ms. Lautman added, a number of pro-gun splinter groups are growing at the expense of NRA membership. She noted a report in Inside Gun News, a pro-gun owners' newsletter, which claimed that membership in NRA declined 300,000, or about 10%, in the past year.    John Acquilino, editor of Inside Gun News and former head of the NRA's public-education department, compared the dispute between the NRA and more hard-line gun owners to &quot;quarreling with your church group.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;A lot of it has to do with a disenchantment with their management techniques and a kind of arrogance they have.&quot;    Neal Knox, once the NRA's chief lobbyist as executive director of its Institute for Legislative Action, said that many members see the NRA as &quot;too soft.&quot; Mr. Knox's charge was echoed in the Idaho press by Bill Bigelow, NRA field agent for Idaho and Montana, and by Al Marion, president of the Idaho Hunters' Association and one of the people who participated in rating Mr. Andrus and his opponent.    &quot;If the NRA is out of touch with its membership,&quot; Mr. Marion said, &quot;it is because they have become too soft on gun control.&quot;    Mr. Knox, who now heads the Firearms Coalition, argued that the NRA demonstrates too much of &quot;a willingness to compromise to be part of the Washington establishment.&quot; He pointed to its involvement in working out legislative compromises on the machine-gun and armor-piercing bullet issue. &quot;We're talking about a principle that was violated,&quot; he said.    Messrs. Knox and Acquilino both believe the NRA is opening the door to greater gun control by giving in on these issues. There is a feeling, Mr. Acquilino said, that &quot;if I give this piece, what is the next piece to go.&quot;    Internecine warfare in the gun-owners movement has weakened the NRA, some critics maintain. &quot;Some old-time congressmen are realizing that there is a division between the membership and the leadership,&quot; Mr. Acquilino concluded.    The NRA's Wayne LaPierre concluded just the opposite. &quot;I don't think we're giving ground,&quot; Mr. LaPierre said. &quot;I think the trend is clearly going in our way.&quot; He cited a new Florida law making it easier to lawfully carry a concealed weapon.    NRA membership director Jim Land said the group's recent falloff came after six years of unprecedented growth during which the NRA went from 950,000 to more than three million members. These were years when the NRA gained a reputation as a tough and successful player both in Washington and local politics. According to Mr. Land, the decline of late can be attributed to a new method of counting members and a dues increase. &quot;There is no identifiable, significant dissatisfaction with the NRA,&quot; Mr. Land said.    Brian Judy, NRA liaison with local organizations in four Western states including Idaho, was a bit more equivocal. &quot;There is a fairly large segment of the NRA population that is extreme on the gun issue. They believe the NRA is soft.&quot; He said that for the past four years at annual meetings a group led by Mr. Knox that espouses this point of view has tried unsuccessfully to take control of the organization.    Depending on whom you talk to, the NRA is either too extremist or too soft, too elitist or too gun-happy, losing ground or gaining ground. What is agreed upon is that the NRA is far from a monolithic organization. And it is that perception of inner turmoil and possible weakness that has encouraged critics of the NRA such as Gov. Andrus to challenge this once-feared organization.    ---   Mr. Wiley, based in San Francisco, writes often on Western U.S. affairs. </TEXT></DOC>
