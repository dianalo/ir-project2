At the same time, there have been significantadvances in mass spectrometric approaches to the analysis of nonvolatilecompounds, most notably the introduction of field desorption (FD) andfast atom bombardment (FAB) as ionization techniques, and the constructionof instruments with increased mass ranges and MS/MS capability. Theyhave investigated the suitability of these new techniques for the analysisof inorganic and organometallic compounds and found them particularlyuseful for structure determination of Tc complexes present in diagnostickit formulations, synthetic intermediates and new compounds, and fortheir analyses in biological fluids and tissues. FD mass spectra aresimpler, providing molecular weight information for neutral compoundsand weights of the cation (positive FD), anion (negative FD) and clusterions. FAB mass spectra are often complicated by oxidation/reduction ofthe metal and by exchange or loss of the ligands. While these processesmay make MW determinations more difficult, they can also indicate chemicalpathways open for exploitation by the creative chemist.</TEXT></DOC>
