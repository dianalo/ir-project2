Short-term air samples were collected for dimethylformamide,ortho-dianisidine, and chromium (VI). Five of six samples showed no detectablelevels of these compounds; the sixth showed a level of dimethylformamidewell below OSHA permissible exposure limits. Deficiencies were notedin chemical-handling procedures, work practices, engineering controls,and employee training and education regarding safety practices.
