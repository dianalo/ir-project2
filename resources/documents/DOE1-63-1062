The Congress -- and, subsequently, the President -- made a toughdecision that this generation must bite the bullet and proceed with thedevelopment of a permanent waste disposal system for the protection offuture generations. The Act was a result of several attempts by the Congressover a number of years to move to action on this important subject. PresidentReagan added his leadership to the task through his 1981 Nuclear PolicyStatement. Today, the author proposes to briefly summarize some of thesignificant achievements concerning implementation of the NWPA, and todirect your attention to courses of action they have placed before theStates and Indian Tribes for comment and about which they will formallyseek Congressional direction.</TEXT></DOC>
