Max Kampelmen also dismissed Soviet calls for a new formalcommitment by both sides to the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty,which restricts each country to a missile defense around one site.He said negotiators have yet to agree on a text pledging both sidesto observe the pact for a certain period.   Negotiatons on a treaty to reduce strategic, or long-range,nuclear arms began in March 1985 and enter their 10th round with aplenary meeting Tuesday. They recessed before the May 29-June 2summit in Moscow between President Reagan and Soviet leader MikhailS. Gorbachev.   Neither side has announced an ending date for this round, atwhich Kampelman said negotiators will try to complete a drafttreaty cutting strategic arsenals in half.   He said in a statement to reporters that the draft treatyincludes ``many key provisions that are completely agreed ... butmuch that is important still remains to be resolved.''   Kampelman and Soviet chief delegate Alexei Obukhov had lunchtogether Monday and discussed issues of ``substance,'' Kampelmansaid, but would not elaborate. In response to questions fromjournalists, he said they should not expect rapid progress.   Negotiators probably will work ``carefully,'' and not bewatching the calendar, he said, adding: ``Don't look for drama.We're at a stage now where hard work is required rather thandrama.''   The chief U.S. delegate said he hopes this round will at least``significantly narrow the differences,'' and expressed the beliefa treaty can be completed before Reagan leaves office in January.The superpowers signed a treaty in December to destroy theirintermediate-range nuclear missiles.   Obukhov said when he arrived Sunday that the talks should not beallowed to lose momentum.   Both sides agree the treaty should reduce their long-rangearsenals over seven years to an overall limit of 6,000 warheads and1,600 launchers, such as intercontinental missiles and heavybombers.   A principal argument is over limiting nuclear-tipped cruisemissiles on warships. On Saturday, Obukhov linked progress at thetalks to resolving that issue.   The United States rejected a Soviet proposal for inspectors tobe allowed aboard ships, and says no other satisfactoryverification methods have been found. The sides have agreed not toinclude the ship-launched missiles in the 6,000-warhead ceiling.   A long-standing problem in negotiations on reducing strategicarms is the Soviet demand that they be linked to limits on the U.S.effort to develop a space-based defense system _ the StrategicDefense Initiative, commonly called ``Star Wars.''   ``We reject Soviet attempts to use these negotiations to have usend our Strategic Defense Initiative,'' Kampleman said.   Kampelman mentioned these other major areas of disagreement:   _The U.S. desire for limits on each kind of intercontinentalballistic missiles within the overall limit of 6,000.   _How to count air-launched cruise missiles and keep track ofmobile missiles.   _``Scores of questions'' on verification.   Related understandings reached at the Moscow summit includedcounting all existing long-range, air-launched cruise missiles anddistinguishing between bombers that carry them and those that donot.   On mobile missiles, the sides agreed to restrict them todesignated territories as a means of making the count simpler. Thesize of the areas was not determined.</TEXT></DOC>
