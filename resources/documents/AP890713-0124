One after another, travel agents told Chinese tour officialstheir ideas for salvaging what both sides had expected to be alucrative summer season.   ``We need very practical solutions and we need them veryquickly,'' said Peter Spreadborough of Silk Route Travel inMelbourn, Australia. ``We may have lost the entire 1989-90 program.We've invested heavily in promoting China. The return will be zerofor most of us.''   His suggestion, echoed by many other agents, was for China toinvest in overseas tour promotions, something China does notnormally do.   ``They want people to come in _ they have to go outside,''Spreadborough said. ``Our problem is destination credibility. Weknow it's safe but until there is some sizeable effort from big gunsin Chinese tourism, we're fighting an uphill battle.''   Ken Chang of Pacific Delight Tours in Hong Kong, said his companylost hundreds of thousands of dollars on promotional material fornow-canceled China tours.   ``We want our Chinese friends to share the risk and the profit,''he said, calling on China to help fund an advertising campaign.   Some travel agents said they still planned to bring in groups inSeptember, although July and August tours were canceled. Patrick Wooof Amerasia Travel in Washington predicted that if the Chinese get30 percent of what they had last year, ``they'll be in good shape.''   More than 4.3 million tourists visited China in 1988 on organizedtours alone, and several times that many are estimated to have comeindividually. China reaped $2.2 billion in hard currency in a majorboost to the country's development program.   But since the army shot its way into Beijing on June 3-4, killinghundreds and possibly thousands of civilians, tourism has nearlyhalted. When 16 foreigners arrived in the eastern province ofJiangxi on Thursday, local officials gave them a ceremony andwelcomed them as the first foreign visitors in two months, theofficial Xinhua News Agency said.   China decided two weeks ago take emergency action, and invitedabout 400 tour agents from Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, the UnitedStates and other countries for a two-day, all-expenses-paid seminar.   At the conference's end, the director of the Beijing TourismAdministration, Bo Xicheng, promised that China would give 20percent discounts to foreign tour groups ``in the near future or atleast before the end of the year,'' Xinhua said.   Some cities' branch offices of the national tour agency also haveannounced price cuts, according to the Toronto-based Travel ChinaNewsletter. Individual hotels in Beijing have begun charging theiroff-season rates.   However, under an austerity program imposed by the government tocounter inflation and other economic problems, China's state-runtour organizations may not have the money to conduct the large-scalepromotion the agents demanded.   Instead, they concentrated on winning over the travel agents.Tour workers from Beijing and other cities pressed their name cardsand glossy brochures into as many hands as possible, and some gaveout gifts of sandalwood fans and tea.   The Chinese also handed out political promotional material:copies of a government report that condemned the student-ledprotests and booklets with pictures of soldiers' burned and beatenbodies.   For $8, the tour agents could buy a government videotape called``The True Story of the Turmoil,'' with footage of civiliansattacking soldiers. The video, a compilation of footage shown onChinese TV, does not show any violence by soldiers against civilians.   Some tour agents defended China's action, while others privatelyexpressed anger and sorrow. But all agreed that China must eitherlift martial law or reduce the military presence before largenumbers of tourists will return.   One suggested putting soldiers on the streets only at night.Henry Wong of Holi Asia Tours in San Francisco said soldiers shouldbe told to take their fingers off rifle triggers and ``smoke acigarette or drink a Coke in order to ease the tense situation.''   Added Australia's Spreadborough: ``Australians find itunacceptable for soldiers to have guns on the street. It makes themjittery. Australians are used to taking vacations on beaches, andyou don't find men with guns on beaches.''</TEXT></DOC>
