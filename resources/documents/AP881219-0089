Fitzwater initially told a White House briefing today that Bush``was seeking his support for the campaign, absolutely ... You havehundreds of meetings like that when you're running for president.''   But the spokesman subsequently said he had misspoken and thatBush did not solicit campaign support from Bakker.   Fitzwater told reporters at the briefing:   ``I don't know what Bakker thought. There was no talk of jobs orpayoffs or anything else. It was a simple meeting as the vicepresident had with hundreds of other people and individuals askingtheir support ... Asking his support for various policies and soforth.   ``They talked about their Christian beliefs. They talked aboutthe Robertson campaign. It was just a friendly discussion.''   At the time that Bush met with Bakker and his wife Tammy Faye inNovember 1985, Fitzwater was Bush's vice presidential presssecretary. Bush was gearing up for his presidential run, as was TVevangelist Pat Robertson, whom Bush ultimately defeated resoundinglyin the Republican primaries.   In March 1987, Bakker stepped down from his PTL ministry,admitting he had had a sexual involvement with former churchsecretary Jessica Hahn.   Bush's ties to the fallen broadcast preacher through the 1985meeting and through three close Bush associates who also were hiredby Bakker as consultants were the subject of a story in Sunday'sopinion section of The Washington Post.   Fitzwater characterized as mostly accurate the story, whichdetailed the Bakker employment of Bush's former press secretary PeteTeeley, and Bush campaign religious liaison Doug Wead, and DeanBurch, former head of the Federal Communications Commission and theRepublican National Committee.   Fitzwater said he had no quarrel with the story, ``except theinnuendo there was something wrong with it,''   He said however there was no talk of Bakker taking anadministration job, as was alleged by Bakker's former personalbodyguard Don Hardister, according to the Post.   Teeley told The Associated Press on Sunday that after leavingBush's staff, he had worked for Bakker as a marketing consultantbeginning in 1985, but that he had not set up the Bush-Bakkermeeting.   ``I have a very hard set rule: I don't lobby Bush,'' because oftheir longtime personal relationship, Teeley said.   His work for Bakker never had anything to do with Bush, saidTeeley, whose association with Bakker ended with Bakker's troubleslast year. Teeley also was Bush's campaign press secretary for atime.   Fitzwater said he knew nothing about allegations that politicalpressure caused the Justice Department in 1983 to drop a FederalCommunications Commission-inspired probe into Bakker's fund-raisingpractices.</TEXT></DOC>
