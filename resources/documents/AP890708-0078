(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three years after a trial, a federal judgestill has not ruled in a case that could change the way an estimated60,000 newspaper reporters, editors and photographers in thiscountry are paid.   The trial of the U.S. Department of Labor vs. the Concord Monitortook just 10 days in June 1986, but court officials say there is nodeadline for U.S. District Judge Shane Devine to act and noindication when he will.   The Labor Department charged that the Monitor owed about $46,000in overtime to 51 employees who worked at the 21,500-circulationnewspaper from February 1978 until January 1980.   Central to the case is the definition of a ``professional.''   The Monitor _ the first paper not to settle such a lawsuit out ofcourt in 40 years _ argued that journalists are professionals andtherefore exempt from overtime provisions of the 1934 Fair LaborStandards Act.   The act labels most reporters, editors and photographers asnon-professionals and eligible for overtime pay or compensatory timeoff for hours worked past a 40-hour limit.   The regulations define editorial writers, columnists, critics and``top-flight'' writers of analytical and interpretive articles asprofessionals.   Others considered professional include those with a knowledge ofa particular field, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, and thosewhose work is ``original and creative in character in a recognizedfield of artistic endeavors,'' such as dancers, actors, painters andshort-story writers.   Journalists' unions and other organizations, in the awkwardposition of having to argue that their members are notprofessionals, warned that if the Monitor prevails, it could meanlong hours and low pay for the nation's journalists.   Barry Lipton, president of The Newspaper Guild's Local 3 in NewYork, said Thursday that Devine's delay hurts journalists.   ``We would expect to prevail on the issue, and the absence of aruling has a tendency to make everything cloudy,'' Lipton said in atelephone interview. ``I think the law in general responds tooslowly to labor matters.''   George Wilson, the Monitor's president and former publisher, saidThursday that pending a ruling, his newspaper has been complyingwith the Labor Department's interpretation of federal law, ``even ifwe disagree with the findings.''   Wilson speculated that Devine has not issued an opinion yetbecause the Concord court, which has only two judges, has beeninundated by a dramatic increase in felony trials and other complexcivil cases.   During the trial, Monitor officials argued that 40-year-oldinterpretations of the federal overtime law used a now-outdatednotion of how journalists work.   Then, many reporters were ``legmen,'' gathering facts andtelephoning them into the newsroom for someone else to write, theysaid.   Media experts testifying for the Monitor said contemporaryreporters and editors regularly use creativity, imagination andspecialized knowledge.   ``On the one hand, we have tried to encourage a bright,intelligent staff to work on its own, and on the other hand we hadthe Labor Department's timeclock mentality,'' Wilson said as thetrial closed.   The department focused on whether Monitor employees werediscouraged from filing for overtime pay, as several testified.   The government presented an expert witness, Ben Bagdikian, a45-year journalism veteran, Pulitzer Prize-winner and formerWashington Post managing editor, who scorned discussion ofimagination and creativity in reporters.   ``If the work of the journalist is primarily invention andimagination then that reporter is usually fired,'' he said.   In a similar Labor Department overtime lawsuit against TheWashington Post, U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell ruled in January1988 that 13 Post editors and reporters were artistic professionals.   But Gesell made the ruling on a motion for summary judgment,before a trial, and an appeals court since has thrown out his rulingand ordered him to hold a trial.   Devine could rule on whether all journalists are or are notprofessionals, or he could decide to rule on the narrow question ofwhether overtime pay is owed to the 51 reporters involved in theLabor Department action and limit the professionalism question tothe Monitor staff or to newspapers in New Hampshire.</TEXT></DOC>
