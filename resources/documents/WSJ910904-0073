Three cheers for a judge tough on crime, but hold on. Mr.Weinberger's claim that Jonathan Pollard committed treason byspying for Israel was bad law or curious diplomacy. Thecapital offense of treason is one of the few crimes definedby the Constitution. &quot;Treason against the U.S. shall consistonly in levying war against them, or, in adhering to theirenemies, giving them aid and comfort.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Prosecutors never claimed that Pollard, who pleaded guiltyto an espionage conspiracy count, either made war against theU.S. or by helping Israel helped an enemy. A prosecutorrepeated the slur by calling Pollard's actions, &quot;traitorousconduct.&quot;   With this kind of hyperbole muddying the case, it's notsurprising that Pollard's lawyers have good arguments for areduced sentence from the federal appeals court inWashington, which will hear Pollard's appeal next week.   It's hard to call up much sympathy for any spy. EvenPollard agrees that his crime deserves considerable time injail. He took advantage of his job as a U.S. Navy analyst topass intelligence to Israel. In 1986, he pleaded guilty todelivering secrets to a foreign government in exchange for$30,000. Still, a nation of civil liberties deserves a newlook at Pollard's life sentence in the penitentiary inMarion, Ill., where for the past five years he has spent 23hours a day in solitary.   Pollard spied for an ally; his neighboring jail cellshouse former CIA agent Edwin Wilson, who armed Libya, andJohn Walker, the former Navy officer whose family soldmilitary secrets to the Soviets. Pollard, a Jewish, tried tojustify himself partially as helping Israel, not hurting theU.S. He pointed out in a letter reprinted on these pagesduring the Persian Gulf War that many of the U.S. spy photoshe supplied to Israel &quot;were of a number of Iraqi chemicalweapons manufacturing plants which the Reagan administrationdid not want to admit existed.&quot; Other material helped theIsraelis evade detection when they bombed PLO headquarters inTunis in 1985.   The most compelling reason to wonder if justice was doneis not what Pollard did or didn't do. It is a more narrowlylegal question: For all the perfidy of Pollard's spying, isthere any justification for the behavior of prosecutors andother government officials involved in this case?   It would have been one thing for Pollard to get a lifesentence after a trial and conviction, but the key is thatprosecutors instead got him to agree to a plea bargain.Prosecutors pledged in exchange to recommend only &quot;asubstantial period of incarceration and a monetary fine,&quot; notlife imprisonment. The bounds of prosecutorial zeal do notallow the government to violate plea agreements. The appealsjudges will hear evidence, including the &quot;traitor&quot; redherring, that prosecutors breached their contract withPollard.   Prosecutors promised in the plea agreement to detail forthe judge only the &quot;facts and circumstances of the offenses.&quot;In the usual course of events, this silence on a defendant'scharacter would have given the sentencing judge a clear hintfor a sentence far below the maximum.   Instead, Pollard's lawyers note that in court theprosecutor went beyond a recitation of the facts of hisoffenses. In addition to the traitor claim, the assistantU.S. attorney pressed for a stiff sentence by using thephrase &quot;arrogance and deception&quot; seven times to describePollard, with &quot;vengeful,&quot; &quot;contemptuous&quot; and &quot;venal&quot; thrownin for good measure.   Prosecutors also trivialized his cooperation and admittedin court papers that they &quot;wired&quot; the plea by holdingPollard's wife hostage to a deal -- much as prosecutors gotMichael Milken to plead guilty by threatening to go after hisbrother. There is no rule against wiring pleas by hingingdeals on freeing third parties from prosecution, but theSupreme Court requires strict judicial review to provevoluntariness.   The appeals judges are in no position to weigh the harm tothe U.S. from Pollard's spying, but they know thatprosecutors were willing to settle for a plea that many courtwatchers guessed would justify a sentence of 15 to 20 years.If they want evidence of the impact of prosecutors goingbeyond the plea bargain, Exhibit A is the shorter jail termsgiven to Americans who spy for our enemies. A good case canbe made for shooting all spies, but disproportionality shouldraise eyebrows:   -- James Hall, an Army officer who sold classified warplans to the Soviet Union and East Germany, was sentenced in1989 to 40 years in jail.   -- Clayton Lonetree, the Marine sergeant in Moscow, spiedfor the Soviets and was sentenced in 1987 to 30 years.   -- Richard Miller, the first FBI agent ever tried forespionage, turned over secrets, including acounterintelligence manual, to the Soviets. Last year, he wassentenced to 20 years. With the time Miller has served andthe judge's urging of leniency, he could be paroled nextyear.   -- Abdelkader Helmy, a missile researcher, was sentencedin 1989 for selling technology to Egypt that found its way toIraq. He got less than five years.   -- Samuel Morison, a Navy analyst, removed scores ofconfidential material, including photos he sold that wereprinted in Jane's Defense Weekly. In 1985, he was sentencedto two years.   Papers filed in Pollard's appeal argue that the questionfor the court is &quot;limits on government when its competitivezeal and retributive anger have been aroused by an unpopulardefendant.&quot; If these words sound like ACLU boilerplate, thePollard appeal is also interesting as the most recent exampleof what might be called civil-libertarian conservatism.   Pollard's lawyer on appeal is Theodore Olson, a formerReagan Justice Department official who was the victim of agroundless investigation by one of Congress's specialprosecutors. Mr. Olson's decision to take on the Pollard casefollows Robert Bork's success in reversing the RICOconviction of Robert Wallach in the Wedtech case. Mr. Bork,the former judge and trashed Supreme Court nominee, is alsoarguing the unconstitutionality of RICO as applied tocommodities traders in Chicago.   The Pollard case raises broad questions about how to treatspies for our allies, but also presents a more constantlypressing domestic issue. This is that no crime entitlesprosecutors to induce plea bargains with broken promises orbullying tactics. Nothing Pollard passed to the Israeliswould harm American interests as much as a declaration byjudges that there are no limits on prosecutors.</TEXT></DOC>
