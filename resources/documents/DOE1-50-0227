The effect of various parameters,i.e. fraction of melted region, walls/roof thickness, flow rate and latentheat of fusion of PCCM on heat flux entering the air conditioned roomhas been studied in detail. Numerical calculations have been made fortwo typical days at Delhi. The following conclusions have been made:(i) thermal load levelling decreases with an increase of the fractionof melted region and vice versa for total thickness of walls/roof; and(ii) phase shift of 10 h is observed for 40-50% fraction of melted regionfor walls/roof thickness of 0.10 m.</TEXT></DOC>
