<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-47-0536 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new single and simple electrochemical etching (ECE) condition is proposedfor efficient etching of alpha tracks over a broad energy range, usingour new multi-chamber ECE system which is capable of etching any numberof chambers in parallel;e.g. 24 chambers used in this study. The principlerationale is the use of a 15N KOH solution at 25/sup 0/C, employing 24kV/cm at 2 kHz for 6 to 10 hours. Alpha registration efficiences of 90+- 10% were obtained in CR-39 up to 5 MeV as well as registering thosefrom radon daughters on a filter. This approach has solved the deficienciesof applying pre-etching of mixed alpha energy tracks and it is practicalfor many health physics and radiation research applications. In thispaper, some preliminary results on: efficiency and track diameter oftracks of alphas up to 5.49 MeV, effect of pre-etching in the same solution,and effect of etching time as well as track characteristics are reportedand discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
