Unfortunately,on these structures, conventional inspection techniques, such as visualtesting and still gaging, are inaccurate, time-consuming, and costly.Conventional tank inspection methods have two pitfalls. First, they havelimited sensitivity. Very often, still gaging inspection is significantlyaffected by temperature variances, the operator's visual interpretations,or mechanical errors. At best, still gaging has a liquid level errorfactor of +-0.125 in. (3.175 mm). In a large tank, that leaves room fora significant stock loss. Second, the tanks scheduled for integrity checksaren't always the tanks with problems. A company's maintenance staffcan spend weeks on still gaging and internal inspections, only to findno problems in those tanks. In the meantime, an uninspected tank couldbe leaking.</TEXT></DOC>
