Horton rescheduled his group's demonstration to avoid picketingalongside the Klan, drawing the wrath of Bill Walton, Grand Dragonof Texas' Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.   ``It's just like them to always run,'' Walton said. ``Theanti-abortion movement needs all the help, all the bodies it canget. They're in no position to pick and choose their fellowprotesters.''   But Horton characterized the KKK's plan to picket the West SideClinic in this Dallas suburb as ``probably nothing more than apublicity stunt.''   Horton said he was dumbfounded when Walton called to say the KKKwould join the picket.   ``The grand dragon told me, `If there were no white babies beingaborted, we wouldn't be at the clinic,''' Horton said. ``The KKKaren't pro-life. They're pro-life for the white race. They're onlyconcerned about white babies being killed.''   Walton countered: ``We're against abortion of any race, period.It doesn't matter if it's black, white, green, yellow, whatever _that's murder. And murder doesn't discriminate.''   Walton said he had hoped to picket alongside Horton's group withabout a dozen other KKK members ``because they could use theattention. When the Klan comes out, the media come with us. Thatguy needs numbers.''   Joan Echols, spokeswoman for the Dallas Abortion RightsEducation League, an umbrella organization for supporters oflegalized abortion, said the anti-abortion organization and theKlan were in cahoots ``just by scheduling their protests atdifferent times.''   She charged the groups were ``all cut from the same cloth.''   The Pro-life Action Network is scheduled to march for two hoursstarting at 8 a.m., followed by the KKK, which will march from 10a.m. to noon.   Bob Salinas, acting director of public safety in WhiteSettlement, said patrols would not be increased Saturday, butpolice would monitor the pickets.   Horton also said he believes the KKK chose to picket the WestSide Clinic because its employees include a black and a Jewishdoctor, both of whom ``fall onto the Klan hate list.''   Walton said the decision was based simply on ``finding one thatwas open on Saturday.''   But Walton said the Klan may have another problem iftemperatures drop.   ``Them robes aren't made for cold weather,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
