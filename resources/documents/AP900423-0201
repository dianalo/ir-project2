A generation that grew up on rock 'n' rolland disco is learning the pleasures of swaying to the rhythms ofsweet ballroom music. And it's not just the older folks, say danceinstructors who are cashing in on the trend.</TEXT><BYLINE>By KELLY P. KISSEL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Brazilian lambada dance craze maybe the fad in some circles but a resurgence of old-fashionedballroom dancing is also sweeping couples back into each other'sarms.   That's sweet music for dance school operators who stand tobenefit the most.   ``People are turning away from the loud noise and that sort ofthing,'' says Richard Stephenson, author of ``The Complete Book ofBallroom Dancing.''   ``They would like to get back into other types of dancing, butthe problem is they don't know any other type of dancing.''   There are plenty of people willing to teach them. Across thenation, local adult education programs are trying to meet thedemands for more and more classes. In this Ohio River city, twoWest Virginians recently opened the Academy of Ballroom Dance.   ``The market is everywhere,'' says Rebecca Richardson, co-ownerof the Huntington academy. ``If people go out and see the cha-chaor the rumba, they like it. They don't know what it is, but theylike it.   ``It's ballroom dancing.''   America's departure from ballroom dancing is blamed in part onrock 'n' roll music and the '60s movement away from tradition. Itwas downright difficult to try ballroom moves to a rockin' BuddyHolly tune and it became gauche for men to lead a dance during thewomen's movement.   ``Women found that they wanted to be able to stand alone,'' saysTom Cyrus, Ms. Richardson's partner.   But, alas, romance has re-entered the picture.   Ballroom dancing was also hurt by fly-by-night dance hallinstructors who insisted that 80-year-old widows needed 20 years'worth of lessons.   There always was some demand for ballroom dance lessons duringthe rock and disco years, but nothing like there is today, Ms.Richardson says.   ``It's not 70-year-olds going to clubs bringing back ballroomdancing,'' she says. ``It's the younger people.''   Stephenson wrote his book with a Connecticut dance instructor in1980 after noting a resurgence in ballroom dancing on their collegecampus.   ``One of the house mothers called him and suggested he come overto her dorm,'' Stephenson says. ``They were having a waltz party,dancing on the carpet in the old dormitory.''   Stephenson still sells about 3,000 copies of the hardcover bookeach year, he says.   Ballroom dancing involves intricate balance, says dancer andchoreographer Marge Champion.   ``It's no fun to dance unless you really have a partner who youcan counterbalance with,'' says Champion, who with her husband,Gower, worked on Broadway and toured clubs and television shows inthe '40s and '50s.   Dave and Anne Griffin of Huntington recently glided, sputteredthen glided again through their fourth dance lesson.   Griffin had a few lessons as a youngster, but Mrs. Griffin hadnever touched a dance floor in a formal setting.   ``All I ever did was what all college kids do _ go to the localjoint and do whatever everyone else was doing,'' she says.   Griffin, who was formerly in law school and now is finishingmedical school, says that in some social-business circles, knowinghow to dance is an asset.   ``I muddled around out there and hoped that nobody wouldnotice,'' he says. ``Most of the time, I sat on the side.''   Stephenson, who also has written two chemical engineeringtextbooks, cites the romantic benefits.   ``A lot of people who meet in the dance classes end up gettingmarried,'' he says. ``The types of kids you're going to meet in thedance class are probably a lot more compatible than ones you'regoing to meet at bars and lounges.''   Many high schools have turned gymnasiums used for physicaleducation classes into temporary dance halls, with teachersbreaking out square dance or waltz records and telling students topair up.   Stephenson says the teachers are trying to teach proper behavior.   ``Students now realize this is an important way to interact withthe opposite sex,'' he says. ``Some students were so hung up thatif they put their arm around their partner, it was an invitation togo to bed with them.''   But dancing is just supposed to be fun, says Elsa Clemensen ofAshland, Ky., who, at 87, is the Huntington ballroom danceacademy's oldest student.   ``I want to dance like those girls in the beautiful dresses onTV,'' she says.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 6</NOTE></DOC>
