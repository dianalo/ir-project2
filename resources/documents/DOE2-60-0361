Temperature curves facilitateaccess to the cold insulation, transport and storage temperatures required.Reference is made to the effects of outdoor temperature levels on refrigeratingtemperatures, to the refrigerating capacities required according to DIN8959, and to ATP regulations (storage heat of superstructures, heat lossesthrough doors, admission of heat to inner walls). The paper points outloading and unloading problems and informs about the refrigerating capacitiesof large mechanical vehicle refrigerators for trailers and motor cars.(HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
