The Commerce Department said building activity rose $3.7 billionto a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $409.2 billion. Strength waswidespread in most categories, but $1.9 billion of the gain came insingle-family homes, which jumped 1.6 percent to $118.5 billion.   Construction spending, which rose 0.7 percent in September and0.2 percent in August, recently has bucked what has been a generallylackluster building trend over the past year.   Even with the latest string of increases, building activityadvanced only 2.1 percent in the past 12 months. Taking a 1.7percent rise in construction costs into account, activity advanced amere 0.4 percent over the period.   For October, residential construction was up 1.0 percent to aseasonally adjusted annual rate of $198.9 billion. The gain insingle-family home building more than made up for a 1.4 percentdecrease in construction of multifamily units, which has beensluggish since federal tax laws were changed effective at the startof last year.   ``A large portion of the single-family activity is in Californiaand Florida,'' said John Savacool, an economist with the Wefa Group,a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm. ``It's easy to see why whenyou look where people are moving to. California's population isgrowing at an annual rate of 400,000, and 300,000 people a year aremoving to Florida.''   Michael Moran, chief economist of Daiwa Securities America Inc.,said he expects housing activity to taper off because interest ratesare rising and because much of the pent-up demand from the early1980s, when interest rates soared, has been filled.   Non-residential construction rose 0.4 percent in October,climbing to an annual rate of $91.3 billion. While construction ofshopping centers and other commercial projects was off by 8.0percent, construction of industrial projects jumped 7.9 percent;hotels and motels, 6.9 percent; and office buildings, 3.0 percent.   Construction of factories, despite a booming manufacturingsector, has held relatively steady over the past year. Manufacturershave preferred to invest in updated equipment, Moran said.   ``There is some reluctance to build new factories because ofskepticism about how long the boom will last,'' he said.   Government construction climbed 2.4 percent to an annual rate of$80.9 billion, reflecting increased spending for schools, sewers androads. Highway construction, the largest government category, was up7.9 percent in October to $25.9 billion.   ``We're looking at a public highway system put together 25 to 30years ago. Spending is going to have to stay strong because the darnthings are falling apart,'' Savacool said.</TEXT></DOC>
