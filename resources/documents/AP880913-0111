Although vast sections of the nation remained under several feetof water, land emerged in Dhaka and other areas where millions ofpeople were living in waterlogged homes and makeshift sheltersbecause their houses were flooded.   The number of officially reported diarrhea cases rose sharply,and a senior health ministry official warned of major healthhazards.   ``The filth caused by flooding and the millions of gallons ofsewage and tons of rotting garbage are posing a serious threat tothe health of 6 million people'' in Dhaka, the official said,speaking on condition of anonymity.   The government's press information department said 33,054 newcases of diarrhea were reported across the country in the past 24hours. That's more than triple the number of cases reported on adaily basis a week ago.   Tuesday's report brought to 283,703 the number of officiallyrecorded diarrhea cases since Aug. 27, when the last round offlooding began. The information department said the number ofdiarrhea deaths since then was 150.   The total number of flood deaths since June 13 _ when the summerfloods started, then receded before rising to new heights in lateAugust _ was 893, according to a government reports. But dailyreports in Dhaka newspapers said 1,723 people died from drowning,snake bites, house collapsing and diseases.   The real number is impossible to ascertain, given Bangladesh'sunwieldy bureaucracy and communications that were poor even beforefloods that covered three-quarters of the nation.   The Flood Control Center said all major rivers, including theGanges, Brahmaputra and Meghna, continued to fall by 1{ to 2 inchesa day. In most places this meant the rivers were still 16 to 27inches above flood level.   Jay F. Morris, deputy director of the U.S. Agency forInternational Development, toured floded areas Tuesday and toldreporters he knew the water was receding, but ``It's worse than Iexpected at this stage _ it's one of the worst things I've everseen in my life.''   Morris arrived in Dhaka on Monday aboard a transport planebearing part of the United States's promised $150 million in reliefmaterials.   Morris's tour included the village of Maosaid 15 miles northeastof Dhaka where he distribuited about 350 food packets that wereprepared by the Care relief organization with funds from U.S. aid.   Families designated by Care field workers received the packagesafter waiting five hours for Morris' arrival at a Roman Catholicchurch where flood waters lapped at the steps.   Behind the church is a home for retarded girls operated by theSisters of Charity, the order headed by Mother Teresa of Calcutta,India, winner of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize.   Sister Blaise, a native of Ranchi, India, said she and the sixother Indian and Bangladeshi nuns had to tie the girls to keep themfrom falling into three feet of water that flooded their dormitorytwo weeks ago.   The dormitory is now above water, but most of the village is asea of ankle-deep mud with pools of stagnated water.   Sister Marie-Noel said most people in the village were eatingone meal a day because food stores were low, and the nuns weretaking rice and lentils from their dwindling stock to nearby areaswhere people had lost their homes.</TEXT></DOC>
