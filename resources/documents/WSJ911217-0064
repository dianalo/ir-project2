During German unification, the CDU linked with the EastGerman straw opposition party of the same name that has lefta Communist legacy threatening Mr. Kohl's election prospects.At a CDU congress that ends today in Dresden, Mr. Kohl isanointing a young east German, Angela Merkel, as CDUassistant chairwoman -- only 25% of members are women -- andhelping boost other untainted easterners. And he wants tocounter the party's graying: Members' average age is 51.   Mr. Kohl owes his victory in last year's first all-Germanelection to support from eastern Germans, and 80% of easternGerman CDU members had belonged to the straw party; theyargue they were forced to make accommodations to surviveunder the Communists. Mr. Kohl is preaching tolerance whiletrying to purge any leftovers that might erupt into morescandals, such as cooperation with the former secret police.   Still, some pro-business groups complain that ChristianDemocrats' manifesto goes too far to appease eastern Germans,particularly on economic issues, such as health-carefinancing.                                                                                                          NEPAL MOVES TO WOO INVESTORS                                                                                                          Nepal's cabinet approved in principle proposals toliberalize foreign investment and simplify industrialpolicies. Katmandu wants investors in varied industrialventures and will provide facilities and special services ina bid to boost employment and production to satisfy localdemand. The plan would give tourism-related investments afive-year tax holiday, cut import duties on production gear,tax industrial ventures' profits at 15% and let exportearnings escape taxes.                                                                                                          FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN CHINA                                                                                                          China has attracted about $21.3 billion in foreigninvestment since opening its economy at the end of the 1970s,the People's Daily said. The funds allowed China to boost itsforeign reserves because they encouraged exports,introduction of advanced technology and improved management.In the early 1980s, China opened five special economic zonesin the south and numerous industrial development zones withpreferential treatment for foreign investment. China hasabout 34,000 foreign-backed enterprises; their 1991 exportsmay reach a record $10 billion.                                                                                                          WORLD ECONOMIC OUTPUT FALLS                                                                                                          Global economic output was off 0.3% this year, the firstdrop since 1945, a United Nations survey shows. Output fellor stagnated this year in most developed market economies,plunged in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and barelykept pace with population growth in much of Africa and LatinAmerica. Growth in the developed economies was estimated at1%, the slowest rate since the 1982 recession.                                                                                                          FRANCE MAY REVAMP STATE FIRMS                                                                                                          French officials are studying a possible reorganization ofsome state-controlled companies, notably in the electronicsbusiness. The revamp, mainly to deal with perennial loserssuch as computer and television concerns, could involvemergers or cross-shareholdings. Some aides said groups ofprofitable and unprofitable firms could be created to allowfund transfers without facing European Community subsidyproblems.

Brokerage and investment firms authorized to operate inone EC member state would be allowed to do businessthroughout the EC without further approvals from nationalgovernments.   Separately, Portugal, which assumes the six-month rotatingEC presidency Jan. 1, became the second EC state to submit aneconomic program aimed at narrowing the gaps between ECeconomies ahead of planned monetary union. Meanwhile, the ECsigned free-trade accords with Hungary, Poland andCzechoslovakia. The unprecedented pacts also provide forpolitical consultations and eventual EC membership.   EC transport ministers agreed on gradual but fulldecontrol of airlines by 1993, and advanced a rule fordevices to prevent speeds over 56 miles per hour on trucksover 12 tons starting in 1994.
