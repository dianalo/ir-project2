SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush is expected to name formerWhite House national security adviser Gen. Colin L. Powell as thenew chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a senior administrationofficial said Wednesday.   The four-star Army general would become the first black to holdthe post as the nation's senior military officer.   Upon confirmation by the Senate, the 52-year-old Powell wouldsucceed Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., who is to retire Sept. 30.   The source, who spoke on condition that he not be identified,said the White House is expected to make the announcement onThursday.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney made the recommendation to thepresident and informed the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday, saidthe official.   The chairman is the principal military adviser to the presidentand the secretary of defense.   Under a new management organization instituted by Cheney, thechairman also wields greater influence over military budgets thanin the past.   Bush's decision to name Powell means that the four-star Armygeneral jumps into the position over several more senior officers.He would be the youngest to sit in the chairman's chair, and one ofthe few not to have attended one of the service academies.   A leading candidate for the position has been Air Force Gen.Robert Herres, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs.   Powell distinguished himself in the highly visible White Houserole and was well known to Bush during his tenure as vice president.   He has not hesitated to speak to groups of young blacks, warningthem of their duty to help others and to protect the gains of thecivil rights revolution.   ``Don't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who pavedthe way for you,'' he told Clark Atlanta University graduates thisspring. ``The greatest danger ... is complacency.''   President Reagan tapped Powell for the White House post inNovember 1987 after Powell had worked 10 months as deputy tonational security adviser Frank Carlucci to reform thescandal-wracked office in the days following the Iran-Contra affair.   Currently, Powell is head of the U.S. Army Forces Command inFort McPherson, Ga., where he has been in charge of keeping the 1million active, reserve and National Guard troops in the UnitedStates ready for combat.   Powell also served as a chief aide to former Defense SecretaryCaspar Weinberger in 1983-1986 and commanded the Army's 5th Corpsin Germany for six months.   Powell was born of Jamaican immigrant parents in New York Cityand raised in the South Bronx. He was commissioned a secondlieutenant in 1958 after earning a bachelor's degree in geology atthe City University of New York, and later earned a master's degreein business administration from George Washington University. Heserved in the Office of Management and Budget in 1972 during a termas a White House fellow.   Powell served in Vietnam in 1962 and again in 1968, and holdsthe Bronze Star for valor and a Purple Heart.</TEXT></DOC>
