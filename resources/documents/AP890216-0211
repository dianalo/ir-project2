The fighting between rebels and troops was the first since Jan.24, when the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said it wouldparticipate in elections if they were delayed six months. Thegovernment said it opposed to the proposal.   Also Thursday, a former guerrilla commander was fatally shot on adowntown street in San Salvador, police and government sources said.His attackers were unknown.   Slain was Miguel Castellanos, 39, who turned against his comradesafter his capture in 1985 and then worked for the government as ananti-guerrilla propagandist.   In 1986, he testified before the Congress that Salvadoraninsurgents received arms shipments from Nicaragua. Castellanos, alsoknown as Napoleon Romero, was director of the government-affiliatedCenter for Studies of the National Reality.   Police and government sources said on condition of anonymity thattwo vehicles carrying assailants intercepted the car in whichCastellanos was traveling near the downtown Flor Blanca soccerstadium..   They said Castellanos' car was riddled with scores of bulletsfrom assault rifles. He was killed instantly and driver andbodyguard were wounded, the sources said.   About 60 guerrillas attacked the army base at the Entre Rioscotton cooperative outside Zacatecoluca with mortar and rifle fire,said Col. Benjamin Canjura, commander of the Army Engineersdetachment in Zacatecoluca, 22 miles southeast of San Salvador.   Canjura told a news conference that nine soldiers were killed and11 wounded during the two-hour attack that began at 2 a.m.   He said the rebels had many casualties, but he said he could notprovide figures.   The Marxist-led insurgents also launched four bombs at theheadquarters of the 6th Army brigade in Usulutan, 68 miles east ofSan Salvador, Col. Jose Tejada said by telephone.   They also launched four bombs at the headquarters of the eliteAtonal battalion about a mile from the 6th brigade, he said.   Three bombs cleared the wall around the headquarters, but did notexplode, he said. The one that fell outside the base exploded besidea house, wounding two civilians, he said.   Canjura said rebels also attacked before dawn Civil Defense postsin Jerusalen, Ostuma and Barrio Nuevo, three small towns in hiscentral military region.   He said three soldiers were killed and three wounded in thoseattacks.   Army troops guard warehouses of large coffee, cotton and sugarcane plantations, which are El Salvador's main foreign exchangeearners. Rebels waging a 9-year-old civil war against theU.S.-backed government try to destroy the products as part of theirstrategy of economic sabotage.   The guerrillas, in a drastic turnabout, offered last month toparticipate in this year's presidential election and respect itsresult if the vote were postponed from March 19 to September. Therebels had boycotted and condemned as sham the five previousnational elections this decade.   They sharply reduced their offensives while the proposal wasbeing debated.</TEXT></DOC>
