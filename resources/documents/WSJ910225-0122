Zuckerman,the well-known former treasurer and vice president ofChrysler Corp., was named senior vice president andtreasurer.   Mr. Zuckerman, 56 years old, succeeds Guli Rajani in thetreasurer post and will report directly to Karl von derHeyden, executive vice president and chief financial officer.A RJR Nabisco spokesman said Mr. Rajani, 48, left hisposition as treasurer and vice president a couple of weeksago to pursue other interests.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Zuckerman gained much stature in the financialcommunity from his role in Chrysler's turnaround in the1980s. He joined the company in its nadir in 1979 and actedas liaison with the federal board that monitored its loanguarantees as well as a financial adviser during labornegotiations. During his nine-year stint, Chrysler'streasurer's department raised more than $5 billion oflong-term public financing and managed corporate pension planassets totaling $5 billion.   &quot;I participated in the great Chrysler turnaround. It wasthe great business story of the time,&quot; he said in aninterview. &quot;Now I have an opportunity to participate in thegreat business story of the '90s -- the expected success ofRJR Nabisco.&quot;   In his new post, Mr. Zuckerman will have a number ofresponsibilities once overseen almost entirely by Mr. von derHeyden. Mr. Zuckerman will be involved in the company'sgrowing investor relations department as well as theday-to-day relations with banks.   &quot;His familiarity with the financial community and proventrack record will be tremendous assets for RJR Nabisco. Weexpect him to make an immediate contribution to a wide rangeof activities here,&quot; said Mr. von der Heyden.   RJR Nabisco, taken private two years ago in the biggestever leveraged buy-out, recently began trading again on theNew York Stock Exchange. The company's debt totals $17.9billion, more than triple the level before the buy-outdespite repayments, and the company is much more dependentupon its tobacco business than before. With much cost-cuttingalready accomplished, the company still faces sizablechallenges of reducing interest expense -- an area where Mr.Zuckerman will play a role -- as well as restoring marketshare of its top cigarette brands, Winston and Salem.   Since his departure from Chrysler in May 1990, Mr.Zuckerman said he received &quot;several&quot; offers for chieffinancial officer positions, none of which tempted him out ofhis plans to focus on his directorships on eight boards. Buthe insists that helping to manage RJR Nabisco's high-debtbalance sheet was too good an opportunity to pass up.   &quot;If you had asked me 60 days ago, I'd have said the oddsof this happening were kind of remote, but I do have an openmind on everything and this was just too good not to do. Thisis the only corporate treasurer's job in the world I wouldhave taken,&quot; he declared. &quot;There was nothing that captivatedmy attention the way this one has.&quot;   Despite his success at Chrysler, he seems to have fewregrets over his departure. &quot;I'm happy that I'm not goingthrough the agony people in Detroit are now going through,&quot;he admits.</TEXT></DOC>
