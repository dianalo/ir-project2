(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After months of anger and uncertainty, astrike deadline looms at midnight Tuesday for 1,700 Appalachian coalminers who have been on the job for Pittston Coal Group Inc. with nocontract.   In recent days, Pittston and the United Mine Workers adopted aconciliatory tone for the first time in the yearlong dispute, eventhough neither side would predict that continuing talks might averta walkout in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.   The UMW issued statements last week that mentioned areas ofagreement. Pittston President Michael Odom said over the weekendthat the two sides were in ``substantial agreement'' on much of newcontract, although a half-dozen key sticking points remained.   They met again Sunday in Washington to continue going over finepoints of a contract offer the union made Tuesday, in response to acompany offer made Nov. 9, company and union officials said.   Pittston and the union planned another bargaining session Monday,Odom said Sunday night.   On Saturday, the governors of the three states said they hadasked UMW President Richard Trumka and the chairman of Pittston'sparent company, The Pittston Co., Paul Douglas, to try and avert astrike, possibly by taking 30 to 60 days for each side to cool off.   ``We're in total agreement with the governors that a strike issenseless to their constituents and communities and the businessclimate of the coal community,'' Odom said from his Abingdon home.   Noting that the governors had asked the union for an immediatereply, Odom said, ``I hoped they would have responded sooner.''   UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran said Saturday that before any decisionon putting off a strike would be made, Trumka would have to conferwith international union officers and elected district and localofficials.   ``As we speak, there's a lot of momentum and people are preparingfor a strike,'' Corcoran said from his home in Silver Spring, Md.``People are getting assignments and meetings are being set up.''   Corcoran said top union officials will probably meet Monday todiscuss the governors' request.   The labor dispute began last winter, when the companies of theBituminous Coal Operators Association agreed on a new contract withminers for the second time in a row with no strike. Pittston haddropped out of the the industry association, saying its business wasdifferent from other major eastern producers and it required adifferent type of contract.   ``This company mines thin, deep metallurgical coal seams thatcompete predominantly in the export market,'' Odom said. ``Thatmarket is not protected by long-term price contracts. Every year,you have to compete with the world competition.''   Other major eastern coal producers enjoy long-term contracts withdomestic utilities, he said.   Miners agreed to stay on the job with no contract after last Feb.1 but each side repeatedly accused the other of hindering progressin the contract talks.   The UMW took miners off the job for a four-day ``memorialperiod'' and then a six-day ``memorial period.''   Pittston cut off health benefits to some 1,500 retirees, widowsand disabled miners, saying the benefits would have to be addressedin a new contract. Several scattered wildcat strikes in Virginia andWest Virginia were believed spurred by retirees who set up picketlines, company and union officials said.   Pittston has vowed to operate through a strike and has advertisedfor permanent replacement miners.   New York analysts who follow the coal industry said last weekthat the company will be able to operate through a strike, althoughit might take several months to get up to full capacity.   But the UMW has two unfair labor practices complaints pendingwith the National Labor Relations Board and if the NLRB rules infavor of the union, UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts said, minerscan strike in protest without fear of being permanently replaced.</TEXT></DOC>
