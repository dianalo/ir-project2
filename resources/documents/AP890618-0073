In another attempt to quell the 18-month uprising in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip, the government outlawed three Moslemfundamentalist organizations.   The military command said the body of a Jewish settler was foundin a deserted area between the West Bank villages of Burkin andSalfit by an Arab who notified Israeli soldiers. It said army unitsrushed to the area, imposed a curfew on both villages and launchinga search for the killers.   Army officials gave no further information and declined to say ifthey suspected Arab terrorists.   Angry settlers quickly held protest demonstrations.   Israel radio said the victim was a 48-year-old resident of thesettlement of Ariel, 21 miles north of Jerusalem. The national Itimnews agency identified the settler as Friedrich Weisenfeld.   Israel radio reported the slain man was found in his car, hispistol was missing and an empty holster and binoculars were near thebody.   In Ariel settlers drove their cars through the streets, honkingthe horns, while their leaders gathered at the local councilbuilding to consider protest actions.   Dozens of settlers drove to Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin'shouse in Tel Aviv and shouted ``Rabin, resign!''   Police watched but did not intervene, according to Israel armyradio.   Israeli said the army command, fearing vigilante actions by thesettlers, sent West Bank commander Brig. Gen. Gabi Ofir to Ariel.   Arab reports said the two teen-agers slain by Israeli troops wereshot in the West Bank town of Nablus.   The army said that in the Gaza Strip an Arab shot at an Israeliofficer, killing a crippled Palestinian vendor and slightly woundingthe officer.   Eighteen Palestinians were wounded by Israli soldiers in sevenclashes in the occupied territories, according to Arab reporters.   The Arab deaths brought to 524 the number of Palestinians killedin the uprising that began in December 1987. Twenty-two Israelishave been killed in violence related to the revolt.   The Cabinet decided Sunday to outlaw the fundamentalist Hamasmovement and the extremist Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad groups. Hamasand Islamic Jihad are the leading Moslem fundamentalist groups inGaza.   Membership in the banned organizations could be punished by up to10 years in prison.   Hezbollah, or Party of God, also operates in southern Lebanon. Itis believed to be the umbrella organization for the Lebanese IslamicJihad, or Islamic holy war, and other pro-Iranian groups holdingforeign hostages in Lebanon.   The government has nurtured some Moslem fundamentalists as apossible alternative to the Palestine Liberation Organization. Butthe fundamentalists have adopted a stand calling for an Islamicstate in the region that would include Israel and the occupiedterritories.   In a May crackdown, more than 200 Hamas militants, includingspiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, were arrested.   Avigdor Feldman, an Israeli attorney specializing in securitycases, said the government decision ``immediately makes all contactswith these groups illegal.''   In Nablus, Saleh Salah Bahsh, 17, was fatally shot in the backSunday, hospital officials said.   An army spokesman said the youth was stopped by soldiers andasked to identify himself, and ``all of a sudden, he hit one of theunit commanders and started fleeing on foot.'' Soldiers opened firewhen the youth refused to halt, he said.   Hours later, Israeli soldiers dispersing a rock-throwing protestshot in the head and killed 19-year-old Mahdi Jamus, Arab reportsand Israel radio said.   In the Gaza Strip, a 45-year-old Palestinian was killed and anIsraeli officer was wounded outside a government office when an Arabassailant in a car opened fire, according to Israeli and Arabreports.   The Palestinian, Salih Subeh Magadmeh, was rushed to Gaza's Shifahospital where he died. The army said Israel Ben-Ishai, thereservist officer, was wounded in the shoulder.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office confirmed plans to meetPalestinians to discuss his proposal to hold elections in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The plan calls for negotiationswith elected Palestinian representatives on interim self-rule forthe 1.7 million residents of the territories.   The meeting is to take place secretly next month in Jerusalem,without publication of the participants' names to prevent anyreprisal by Palestinian militants opposed to talks, Shamir'sspokesman Avi Pazner said.   The daily Haaretz newspaper quoted diplomatic sources in Londonas saying PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat had given approval for 10Palestinians to speak with Israeli officials. This came despiteobjections from Farouk Kaddoumi, another senior PLO official, thepaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
