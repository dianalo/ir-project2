Under the new venture, General Motors Corp., Ford MotorCo. and Chrysler Corp. will work together toward developing acommon computer language so the next generation of automotivecomputer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systemswill be easier for their engineers to use.</LP><TEXT>   The partnership is the seventh joint research effort theBig Three have formed since 1988 in the face of stiffcompetition from Japanese auto makers. The Big Three venturesnow include efforts to share the costs and fruits of basicresearch into electric car battery technology, pollutioncontrol, new materials and high-tech wiring systems.   The CAD/CAM venture takes aim at a particularly vexingproblem hobbling Big Three efforts to speed up new vehicledesign. GM, Ford and Chrysler all have sophisticated computersystems that allow engineers to design parts on a screen, andelectronically transmit those specifications to tools thatfabricate parts or dies. Such technology is critical toreducing the time and money it takes to design a new vehicle.   But many current computer-aided design and manufacturingsystems aren't compatible, meaning information drawn on onebrand of CAD system can't be transmitted easily to engineersusing a different brand. In a statement yesterday, the BigThree said their partnership may work with outside CAD/CAMsoftware providers, many of whom would be directly affectedby a Big Three decision to move to a common CAD/CAMarchitecture.</TEXT></DOC>
