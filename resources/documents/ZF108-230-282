(LAN Lines)(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Danielle, Diane.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Many LAN software packages are so poorly documented that theirmanuals complicate rather than expedite installation and use.andO;Application software manuals should indicate whether the userneeds to run an installation program; how much RAM the programrequires; whether it is 'network aware' or not; how it supportsvideo boards; and whether it will run from a path.andP;  Other softwareelements which tend to be inadequately documented are whetherusers can or should use environment variables to set defaults;whether all files supplied on the program diskettes are needed;and how configuration files work.andP;  Unusual or complex productsshould also have a description of the environment for which theyare designed.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer softwareDocumentationNetwork ManagementManagement of EDPUser Needs.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>My desktop, shelves and floor are overflowing with manuals.andP;  Gone are thedays when products came with one manual.andP;  Now they come with at least half adozen on glossy paper, in fancy binders.andP;  But none contains what I, as a LANmanager, want.andM;I am weary of leafing through mind-numbing instructions.andP;  I'm willing toconcede that most vendors must write their documentation for the lowestcommon denominator, but do major LAN vendors truly believe their operatingsystems are being installed by people who don't know what a directory is?andP;  Orby people who cannot navigate a menu system without 20 pages of instructionson how to select the menu items?andM;What I want is a brief &quot;theory of operations,&quot; written by a professional fora professional.andP;  For most applications software, this would consist of a fewpages, in an appendix, that address the following:andM;1.andP;  Must the installation program be used, or can the files be copied to adirectory?andP;  If it must be used, why?andP;  What does it do?andP;  Can the program bestored in any directory on any disk?andM;2.andP;  &quot;Runs in 640K&quot; has become a meaningless phrase.andP;  Most computers todayhave 640K.andP;  But with some LAN operating systems, you're lucky to have 400Kfor applications.andP;  How much available RAM does the software require?andM;3.andP;  Does the software create any files in the program directory duringexecution, or is data written to the executable file?andM;4.andP;  Is the software LAN-aware?andP;  Will the stand-alone version run on a LAN, ormust one install the LAN version?andP;  If it uses a counter for concurrentaccess, where is the information maintained, and what rights do users need?andM;5.andP;  How does the software support video boards?andP;  Does it auto-sense them, ordoes it need a configuration file?andM;6.andP;  If the program uses configuration files, what are their names, and whatinformation do they contain?andP;  Where does the software expect to find them?andO;In the program directory?andP;  In the current directory?andP;  Can I tell the programwhere to look (with a command-line parameter or environment variable)?andM;7.andP;  Will the software run from a path, or must it be run from the programdirectory?andM;8.andP;  Does the executable file accept command-line parameters?andM;9.andP;  Can environment variables be used to set defaults?andP;  Must they be used?andO;(Two very different issues.)andM;10.andP;  If the software has printer drivers, where and how are they maintained?andO;Can I build my own?andP;  Can I store them centrally, or must each user have apersonal copy?andM;11.andP;  If this is an upgrade, what are the major changes or enhancements?andP;  Mustdata or configuration files be converted?andM;12.andP;  Are all the files on the program diskettes required? (I would appreciatea complete listing, by diskette, with a brief description of each one'sfunction.)andM;13.andP;  Are there any &quot;gotchas&quot;?andP;  For example, must I use the originalandM;non-write-protected diskette to do the installation, or must I run Program Xbefore I can run Program Y?andM;For complex or unusual products, a few paragraphs describing the environmentfor which the vendor has designed the program would be helpful.andP;  This isespecially important for programs written to take advantage of LANs.andP;  If thesoftware has multiple modules, I want to know how the pieces fit together andwhat choices, if any, I have about the configuration and what the trade-offsare for different setups.andM;This theory of operations should not contain one line of syntax.andP;  Itshouldn't tell me how to set up the product on a server, unless the softwarerequires a particular configuration.andP;  It should alert me to the consequencesof choosing among alternative setup strategies.andM;Point me to the right pages for detail.andP;  But give me a quick start.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
