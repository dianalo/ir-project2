About 3,500 workers and students battled police in the port cityof Ulsan, about 150 miles southeast of Seoul, news reports said.The sporadic street fighting and protests lasted most of the day,according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.   Thousands of high school students, shoppers and office workerscaught in hit-and-run street battles fled, covering their mouthsand faces from clouds of choking tear gas, reports said.   In Seoul, about 1,000 students from Hanyang university protestedthe government decision to use 14,000 riot police to put down themore than 3-month-old strike at the Hyundai shipyard.   There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries in Seoul,but Yonhap said 80 workers and police had been injured in Ulsansince police entered the shipyard Thursday.   The shipyard is owned by the Hyundai Group, one of the largestconglomerates in South Korea.   Hundreds of masked students carrying banners withanti-government slogans streamed from the university gates shouting``Down with Roh Tae-woo who stifles workers' rights!''   They burned effigies of Roh and Chung Ju-yung, honorary chairmanof Hyundai. Some hurled firebombs and swung wood and steel clubs,while others stood on walls surrounding the campus and threw rocks.   Riot police fired hundreds of tear gas shells.   The National Council of Student Representatives, a major radicalstudent group, said it would launch a nationwide wave of attacks onHyundai in support of workers. Hyundai offices and automobileshowrooms were attacked Friday and protesters battled police inseven cities.   In Ulsan, thousands of riot police guarded the shipyard and setup check points around bus terminals and on roads leading to theshipyard to block more sympathizers from joining the protesters,said Yonhap.   Operations at the shipyard were slow, although more than half ofthe 22,000-member work force showed up for work Saturday, officialssaid.   Prosecutors brought formal charges against 10 union leaders forconspiring to cause violence and said investigations continuedagainst some of 697 other workers who were arrested.   Riot police stormed the shipyard Thursday in a land, sea and airattack to end a violent strike that left about 400 people injured.   Hyundai's trouble began Dec. 12 when about 5,000 militantworkers broke away from a company-sanctioned union and organized aseparate group, demanding pay increases and better workingconditions.   The police intervention triggered violent protests in Seoul andother cities by strike sympathizers who accused the government ofsuppressing free labor and protecting conglomerates at the cost ofworkers.</TEXT></DOC>
