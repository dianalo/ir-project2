As an agricultural trade policy analyst, I cannot help but agree with the basic thrust of his analysis -- that U.S. agricultural policies are not achieving the goals they were designed to achieve.    I would like to point out, however, that while Mr. Bovard heaps blame upon the Agriculture Department for inconsistent, expensive and self-defeating policies, in fact these policies have been promoted and continued by a coalition of producer groups, congressional committees, bureaucrats (from USDA as well as other agencies) and willing taxpayers.
