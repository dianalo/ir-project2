Thousands ofworkers are killed or crippled every year in what critics claim isthe world's highest industrial accident rate.   The economic miracle has transformed South Korea in 30 years froma poor, backward nation into an industrial powerhouse, but littleattention has been paid to the cost of the rapid growth.   An average of five workers are killed and 390 are injured everyday in accidents in every kind of workplace, from huge factories andshipyards to backstreet sweatshops employing two or three people.   In 1987, 1,761 workers were killed in job accidents and 25,244were maimed, according to government figures. In the three yearsfrom 1985 to 1987, 5,139 workers were killed and 66,991 were maimed,the figures show.   The number of serious accidents is increasing as the economygrows. The accident rate rose from 654 deaths and 2,717 cripplingaccidents in 1972 to the 1987 total, the figures show.   The Korean Federation of Labor Unions and academic experts, usingfigures from international labor sources, contend South Korea hasthe world's highest industrial accident rate. Safety standards arenot enforced and the government and businesses are concerned onlywith economic growth, they claim.   South Korea's accident rate is five times greater thanneighboring Japan's or Taiwan and about 15 times higher than Westernnations, officials said.   Labor Ministry officials deny that South Korea has the world'sworst accident rate, but said they did not know of a nation with ahigher one.   The International Labor Organization, an arm of the UnitedNations in Geneva, said it does not compile comparative figures onindustrial accidents.   Government officials acknowledge that little has been done toenforce safety and health regulations and many people work indangerous conditions. The government wants to cut the accident ratein half by 1990, they say.   ``It's shameful to have such a high industrial accident rate,''said Kim Jung-kyu, who heads the Ministry of Labor's safety section.   Labor union activists maintain that the main causes of accidentsare poor working conditions and pressure on workers to meetproduction schedules at any price.   Many factories have little or no safety gear, and workers spendup to 12 hours a day in deafening, poorly lit and overheatedworkspaces where they become fatigued and easily make mistakes thatcause accidents, activists said.   ``Many workers spend their days in terrible, dehumanizingconditions where they are considered virtually expendable. There arealways more workers ready to work,'' said one activist.   Past authoritarian governments played a major role in planningand directing South Korea's rapid economic and industrial expansion.The governments allowed businesses to ignore or scrimp on safety andhelped suppress labor protests.   The Labor Ministry's safety section, which is responsible forenforcing safety nationwide for more than 6 million industrialworkers, has a staff of 13 people.   While insisting that the government attitude has changed, Kimsaid safety still is ignored by many employers. Many companies savemoney by not installing safety devices or training workers to useequipment, he said.   Park Sang-nak, a top safety official with the Korean Federationof Labor Unions, said it is cheaper for companies to paycompensation to injured workers than spend money on safety equipment.   Employers pay marginal compensation for accident victims underKorean law. Maximum compensation for the family of a worker killedin an accident provides enough money to live on for just two orthree years, officials said.   The growing sophistication of Korean industry is adding to safetyproblems and accident rates, rather than cutting them as in othernations, officials say.   Many companies eager to get ahead often introduce advancedequipment before their workers are capable of using it safely,government and labor officials said.   ``Companies have gotten big by using new tools, advancedtechnology and dangerous chemicals,'' Park said. ``But workers havenot been given adequate education or training.''   But Kim of the Labor Ministry said many workers are indifferentto safety and he claimed that carelessness is one of the main causesof accidents.   ``Many workers do not wear helmets, goggles or heat-proofclothing even when it is provided.''   Labor unions and political parties are pressing the government totake drastic action to enforce safety regulations and cut accidents.Poor safety is the second main cause of strikes after wage demands.   President Roh Tae-woo's administration, which took office inFebruary, says it wants to drastically reduce industrial accidentsas part of its efforts to improve life for the working classes.   Roh hopes to attract more public support for his administrationand defuse potential worker unrest. The government no longerautomatically sides with management and has encouraged companies togive raises and other concessions.   The Labor Ministry plans a major survey of businesses to ensuresafety regulations are enforced and to cut accidents by more thanhalf by 1990.   But a government plan to increase safety spending by 280 percentin 1989 will still mean just $17.4 million is available _ far belowthe levels of most industrial nations. Plans for more safetyinspectors will add just a few dozen personnel.   Labor leaders call the plan inadequate.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs Dec. 22</NOTE></DOC>
