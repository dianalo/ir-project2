Which isit?;    -- Allyson Forster, San Jose  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  'GREEN CARD' STATUS STIRS UP CONFUSION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Action Line  </MEMO><TEXT>  A  The Motion Picture Association of America rates &quot;Green Card&quot; PG-13. Two ofthose ads contained typos, the result of &quot;human error,&quot; and they are beingcorrected, says Geri Wolfsheimer, AMC marketing director for NorthernCalifornia and Washington state. Wolfsheimer says AMC wasn't aware of theproblem until we brought it to the Motion Picture Association's attention. Sheurges theatergoers with similar complaints to contact AMC's district office inMilpitas at (408) 946-1912. &quot;Errors like this are unusual,&quot; says Gail Markels,vice president of the Motion Picture Association of America. But she adds thatthe MPAA considers viewers its &quot;eyes and ears&quot; in ensuring theaters complywith the voluntary ratings system established in 1968. The system was intendedto give parents enough information about movies to determine which theirchildren might enjoy. Those with questions or complaints about the ratingsshould either contact theater managers or write the Motion Picture Associationof America's Rating Classification Administration, 14144 Ventura Blvd.,Sherman Oaks 91423.;     Financing deadline eased;  Q  On Dec. 29, 1989, Ipurchased a Mitsubishi television, VCR and stand from Anderson's TV onSaratoga Road. At the time of purchase, Anderson's featured a package thatoffered no-interest financing on all Mitsubishi products if the buyer paid offthe balance in full by the date the sixth installment was due. I believe Ifulfilled all my obligations. The finance company administering this contracthas been billing me for $85.53 -- the finance charge. When I call, I'm told myfile can't be found. Please help settle this problem.;    -- P. Lee, San Jose;A  Anderson's TV went to bat for you and had the finance company erase the$85.53 finance charge. The contract says you were supposed to pay the balance&quot;on or before the sixth installment due date.&quot; That would have been June 28.The finance company didn't receive your final payment until July 3 -- fivedays later -- so it started billing you for the finance charges. Anderson's TVtalked the company into reversing its decision and listing your account aspaid in full.;     Metering lights good idea;  Q  I am impressed with theexpansion and other improvements on Interstate 280. However, there is adangerous area: the southbound on-ramp from Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road. I thinkmetering lights would be a tremendous asset.;    -- T. Adam, Campbell;  A  Thestate Department of Transportation agrees with you. And in about six months,the state will begin installing metering signals for all the southboundon-ramps on I-280 between Highway 85 and Saratoga Avenue. The project will befinished by the end of 1991, says a Caltrans spokesman. He says the signalswere not included in the widening project because of a lack of funds when thatproject was approved. Funds for the signals were made available after voterspassed Proposition 111 last June. That proposition authorized an increase inthe gas tax to pay for such highway projects.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910323  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  525  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday March 23, 199100083191,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
