The Fed intervention, which was described by traders as unaggressive and ineffective, did little more than brake the dollar's descent against other currencies. Although traders were uncertain how many dollars the Fed has purchased, they say it simply hasn't been enough to overcome the market's bearish sentiment.    The lack of a determined effort by the Fed or the Bank of Japan has caused traders to continue to speculate that the two central banks want stability in the marketplace rather than a higher dollar.    In late trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7733 marks, down from 1.7815 late Tuesday, and at 124.28 yen, down from 125.00 yen. Sterling was quoted at $1.7815, up from $1.7722 late Tuesday.    Markets in Tokyo are closed Thursday for a holiday.    The dollar's continued slide is &quot;indicative of a market that is fully flush with dollars and has no confidence to keep them. We need central banks to dry out the market's liquidity in dollars,&quot; said Michael Guarino, vice president and chief dealer with Algemene Bank N.V. in New York.    As was the case on Monday and Tuesday, the Bank of Japan initiated the intervention efforts in Tokyo trading after the dollar opened lower than its late Tuesday levels in New York. During the morning session, traders estimated that the Bank of Japan purchased about $100 million. As the afternoon session opened, the Bank of Japan re-entered the market and purchased another $200 million.    The intervention efforts and a more important late short-covering rally boosted the dollar to 124.65 yen from its intraday low in Tokyo at around 124.40 yen.    The dollar remained fairly steady through European trading, but was again attacked by U.S. dealers, prompting the Fed to come into the market and defend the dollar at 124.85 yen, 124.50 yen and the 124.30-yen through 124.15-yen levels.    Despite the Fed's efforts, the dollar quickly slid lower after each intervention attempt.    &quot;The Fed's effect in the foreign exchange market has had diminishing returns. The first time they intervened this week, they pushed the dollar up 40 to 50 points,&quot; said Marc Cohen, vice president and manager of corporate foreign exchange with Republic National Bank of New York. &quot;The second time, they pushed it up 30 to 40 points. Now the dollar is coming off right after they stop buying dollars.&quot;    Profit-taking late in New York trading finally stopped the dollar's slide and stabilized the U.S. currency around 124.40 yen.    Despite the late gains by the dollar, Earl I. Johnson, vice president and corporate adviser at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, dismissed the upward movement as simply profit-taking in a thin market. He added that any additional sell-offs of the dollar would still start at lower levels than previously.    On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery surged up $10.20 to $421.80 an ounce in heavy trading. Estimated volume was 5.5 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Thursday, gold was quoted at $421.05 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
