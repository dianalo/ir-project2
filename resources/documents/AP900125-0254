The Labor Department said 1989 was the first time since 1981that negotiated settlements provided larger wage adjustments thanthe contracts they replaced. The last time parties to 1989settlements negotiated, usually in 1986 or 1987, average wage rateadjustments were 2.4 percent over the contract term.   Wage restorations in steel and other industries, as well as wagegains for nurses, accounted for the difference, the agency said.   Last year's 3.3 percent wage gains also were up from the 2.4percent average wage gains contained in collective bargainingagreements settled in 1988.   The collective bargaining report, like the Labor Department'sbroader Employment Cost Index report, showed workers in thefast-growing service sector winning larger wage gains thanmanufacturing workers. Service workers received an average of 3.5percent hikes over the life of the contracts while manufacturingworkers received 3.2 percent raises.   The Labor Department said the 459 collective bargainingagreements it analyzed covered about 1.85 million workers. Thegovernment tracks agreements covering bargaining units with atleast 1,000 workers.   The government said 114 such contracts covering 743,000 workershad been expired or reopened in the last quarter but had not beensettled or ratified by Dec. 31. About half of those workers areemployed in railroads.</TEXT></DOC>
