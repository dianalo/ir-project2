PulliamandM;Lebanon, TennesseeandM;When we called CPD, customer service manager Chris Brownstead was anxious toresolve the confusion.andP;  According to Brownstead, your order was shipped aboutthe time you canceled it.andP;  UPS then misplaced your returned package, whichdelayed your refund.andP;  Brownstead apologized for the mix-up, and CPD isrefunding you the full $338.50.andM;WANG SCANNER FALLSandM;INTO GRAY AREAandM;I ordered a Wang IS30M4 scanner from IME Computers in Boston under theconditions that the software provided be Windows 3.0 compatible and that thescanner and software produce true 64gray-scale images.andP;  My order arrived, butthe software scans only in Windows Real mode and does not support true64-gray-scale reproduction.andM;IME's tech support staff suggested that I purchase another software program,Gray F/X, to produce 64 gray scales-even though my salesperson assured methat the scanner included everything I needed.andP;  Nevertheless, I purchasedXerox Gray F/X, and it doesn't support my scanner.andP;  I have contacted IMErepeatedly and have not been able to resolve this problem.andP;  Michael J. CashCedar Rapids, IowaandM;According to IME soles manager Deborah McConchie, the scanner and softwarework in all three Windows modes for mage editing, but only work in WindowsReal mode for scanning.andP;  She added that Wang plans a software upgrade tocorrect this.andP;  McConchie also says the scanner is capable of 64 gray-scalereproduction, but the software included with it doesn't support 64 grayscales.andP;  In fact, says McConchie, the software is simply a promotional add-onand is not always included with the scanner.andP;  IME recommended Gray F/Xbecause Wang recommends it for the scanner.andP;  IME regrets any problems youhave experienced and says it did not intend to misrepresent the product.andP;  IMEhas agreed to grant you a full refund and waive its restocking fee.andM;TIP OF THE MOUTHandM;When ordering by mail, a money-back guarantee isn't always a guarantee thatyou'll get ail your money back.andP;  Even companies that offer a money-backguarantee in their ads may charge a 15 to 20 percent restocking fee onreturned merchandise or withhold the original shipping costs.andP;  Othercompanies charge such fees only on certain components or brands.andP;  This policymay not be spelled out  in the ad.andP;  Ask about a vendor's return policyregardless of what the ad says so you won't be kit with hidden fees later on.andM;Do you need help resolving a consumer issue?
