The helicopter went down about 10 a.m. after a propeller caughtconcertina wire atop the wall at the federal MetropolitanCorrectional Center, authorities said.   Benjamin ``Barry'' Kramer, a champion powerboat racer serving alife sentence, and the pilot, whose identity wasn't immediatelyknown, were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital after the escapeattempt, said U.S. Marshal Daniel Horgan.   ``Prison guards immediately extracted Kramer and the pilot outof the wreckage and administered first aid. They were hurt quiteseriously,'' Horgan said.   ``Ironically, they were taken by helicopter to the hospital,'''Horgan said.   Initial reports indicated the pilot suffered head, neck and backinjuries and Kramer, 34, fractured his left ankle, authorities said.   MCC is the major prison for drug traffickers and others arrestedfor federal crimes in South Florida.   Among some 1,000 inmates are Miami policemen convicted ofrunning a drug ripoff ring and others convicted of large-scalecocaine and marijuana trafficking or awaiting trial.   Warden John Clark said that the helicopter reportedly hoveredjust above the recreation yard and that Kramer grabbed onto a skiand was either climbing into the craft or was aboard when itcrashed.   Some witnesses said a second inmate may have tried to climbaboard, he said.   ``It appears he was ready,'' Clark said. ``According towitnesses, he ran to the helicopter and jumped on as soon as itswooped down.''   The pilot was holding an identification for Charles ClaytonSterns, but the warden said authorities suspect the ID may havebeen for Kramer.   Kramer was convicted in October in Illinois federal court ofrunning a continuing criminal enterprise and was sentenced to lifewithout parole under the ``drug kingpin'' law, Horgan said. Kramerwas brought here in December in connection with federal charges inFlorida for distribution of marijuana.   Kramer was exercising in a portion of the prison for escaperisks, including anyone serving a life term, authorities said.   The wrecked helicopter was a two-seat, Bell-model bubble type,authorities said.</TEXT></DOC>
