(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state judge spared the United Mine Workersfrom another hefty fine Monday to give negotiations mediated byformer Labor Secretary Bill Usery a chance to progress.   Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin said the unionviolated his strike restrictions 84 times in August and Septemberand said nearly half of the acts were violent. The most blatant actof defiance he cited occurred last month when 98 union membersinvaded Pittston Coal Group's main preparation plant and occupiedthe building for four days.   However, McGlothlin, who previously issued fines totaling $31million for illegal strike activities directed at Pittston, said hewanted to avoid any action that could impede progress at thebargaining table.   The judge said he would wait until Dec. 8 to decide whether toimpose additional fines.   ``The court feels there seems to be high hope'' for progress incontract talks, McGlothlin said in a courtroom filled with strikingminers and supporters. ``It's important to the parties that Mr.Usery and the negotiators for both sides have the best possiblecircumstances to work with.''   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole last week appointed Usery as a``super'' mediator in the strike. The walkout, involving Pittston's1,695 union workers in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, beganApril 5.   Previous talks conducted under the auspices of the FederalMediation and Conciliation Service produced virtually no progress.   McGlothlin also said he wanted his postponement to encouragestriking miners to put an end to violent acts undertaken to disruptcoal shipments and intimidate replacement workers. The judge saidthat for three weeks after the preparation plant takeover,virtually no violations of strike restrictions were reported.   Bruce Bratten, a member of the union's negotiating team, said hewas surprised and pleased by McGlothlin's decision. ``I think he'sgiven the process a chance to work.''   Pittston attorney Stephen Hodges said, ``If it helps end theviolence, who can complain about that? Not me.''   Bratten said McGlothlin's previous fines, stretching back toJune, allowed Pittston to stall in contract talks. ``They had adirect impact on Pittston's desire to negotiate in good faith. Thestate court placed economic pressure on the union.''   McGlothlin heard two days of testimony in a contempt of courthearing last week and said he wanted to wait until Monday to rulein order to review the evidence.</TEXT></DOC>
