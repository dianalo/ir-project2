 Austin Computer Systems last week opened up forbusiness in the UK, becoming the third direct sales company from Austin,Texas eager to establish itself outside its homeland.andP;  With a $50 millionturnover, Austin lacks the muscle of its two big competitors but claims thatit can more than compete with them in termS of price, service and support.andM;CompuAdd and Dell have become &quot;a bit complacent&quot; in the UK, according toAustin's UK managing director, Jonathan Langley, who has moved from his jobas Austin's international division vice president to spearhead the UKoperation.andP;  &quot;They have had the game to themselves for too long.andP;  Their pricesare a lot less competitive than they should be,&quot; he says.andM;The idea of selling PCs directly to end-users was pioneered by Michael Dellin 1984.andP;  At the age of 19, he founded a company called Dell Computer, whichtook the concept of selling computers via mail order one step further.andP;  Dellfilled a niche in the market by building machines to order and bundling anafter sales service and support package that no-one else had provided.andM;Dell has been successful fun stop.andP;  it was the first mad order computercompany to give the support that people needed, &quot; said jeremy Davis of UKmarket analysts, Context.andP;  Michael Dell's vision paid off - his companygrossed $388 million last year.andM;Not surprisingly, Dell was soon to face competition in its homeland.andP;  in 1986Austin launched a direct sales operation as an offshoot from its PC retailstores, called Micro City.andP;  CompuAdd, which started out as a computerperipherals retail chain, published its first PC mail order catalogue in 1987and last year hit worldwide revenues of $400 million.andM;Dell was also the first of these companies to expand overseas, setting up aUK division in 1985; this division now accounts for 20 per cent of Dell'sworldwide revenue.andP;  But CompuAdd was soon to follow and set up shop inBristol in 1988, although analysts say it has not enjoyed the same success inthe UK as Dell.andP;  Now Austin is hoping to grab a piece of the action.andM;Austin has started by hiring six people to handle the UK division, which isbased in Berkshire and includes warehousing and PC configuration facilities,plus a sales and administration office.andM;In common with Dell, Austin will sell its machines through VARs  Value AddedResellers) as well as by catalogue.andP;  Reseller margins of 15 per cent havebeen mentioned, which would make them better than Dell's discounts of betweensix and 14 per cent.andP;  Indeed, Austin claims to have already poached some ofDell's resellers.andM;But Dell claims to be unconcerned by this,  Dell VARs are not motivated bymargins.andP;  They're selling a solution.andP;  So they're making their margins onthat total solution - the cost of the support and so on,&quot; said Maurice Cowey,Dell UK marketing manager.andP;  He mentioned sales lead generation and directcustomer shipping and billing as some of the services Dell offers its VARs.andO;&quot;If the VAR is only interested in margins, then it's not the type of VAR thatwe're looking for.andP;  &quot;andM;The Austin product brochure offers 286 through to 386-based desktops, with SXsystems being predominant and projected to become the firm's biggest sellers,Austin first advertised the SX models in March and says a number have alreadybeen shipped in the UK.andM;Austin is also said to undercut the retail price of comparable systems fromCompuAdd and Dell.andP;  As an example, Langley cited the SX-based AustinNetStation, which costs S995 for a diskless model equipped with an Ethernetcard, cabling and mono monitor.andP;  &quot;A comparable machine from Dell costs[British pounds]  1,349 and comes with no cabling,&quot; he said.andM;Dell and compuAdd admit that Austin may price its machines below theirs butneither claims to consider Austin a threat.andP;  &quot;The buying price is oneelement.andP;  The cost of owning the product is more important to a user.andP;  Howmuch support can you give with six staff.&quot; said Cowey.andP;  To support itscustomers, Dell has a technical support department equipped with 15 phonelines for general customers plus 15 lines for key accounts, an obtainable ona freephone number.andP;  outgoing lines, it says, are separate.andP;  &quot;Over go percent of the technical enquiries we receive are diagnosed and dealt with overthe phone,&quot; he added.andM;Ken Jacobson, CompuAdd managing director, also expressed doubts about thequality of support that Austin can offer.andP;  He described Austin's pricingpolicy as a short term objective designed to increase its market share.andO;&quot;They must be running a loss leader.andP;  our prices are competitive but we needto retain profit in order to develop our business,&quot; he said.andM;Austin would undoubtedly argue that it has not skimped on service or supportin order to keep down costs.andP;  Product prices include a free 12 months on-sitewarranty and lifetime access to a freephone technical support line.andO;Furthermore, Austin intends to bundle DOS and delivery free of charge and todeliver goods within 48 hours - unlike its two competitors.andM;But is there room in the UK market for another direct sales company? Or canAustin eat into its competitors share of the cake? Analysts believe that withthe current industry climate the answer to both questions is no.andM;&quot;It's a difficult market to break into,&quot; says Andy Baul-Lewis, analyst frommarket research firm Romtec.andP;  You need lots of money to invest.andP;  I'm not surethat Austin will see major growth in the UK.&quot;andM;Davis agrees that Austin will probably have a tough time trying to create aname for itself in the UK.andP;  But at the same time, he suspects the directsales market may be starting to buoy up, mirroring trends in the US, where anincreasing number of PCs are now being sold through direct channels and VARS,as people become more computer literate.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
