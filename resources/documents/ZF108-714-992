(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>REPOSITORY RACE GETTING CROWDEDandM;On Sept. 19, 1989, IBM of Armonk, N.Y., announced its application developmentarchitecture of the future, AD/Cycle, and the race was on.andM;For IBM, the race begins with the definition of the Information Model of itsMVS-based Repository Manager (see related story, p. 91).andP;  This task is beingperformed by IBM's Information Model council, which consists of internal IBMpersonnel and IBM's equity partners (Index Technology, Cambridge, Mass.,andO;Bachman Information Systems, Burlington, Mass., KnowledgeWare of Atlanta, andthe newest member, Synon of Larkspur, Calif.).andM;Other vendors are racing to keep up with IBM and to make their repositorystrategies known.andP;  One of IBM's strongest competitors in this arena isDigital Equipment Corp. of Maynard, Mass.andP;  DEC's repository product,CDD/Plus, and its associated tools services strategy, Application ToolIntegration Services (ATIS), are available now.andP;  Other vendors have their owncomprehensive Case strategies.andP;  For example, IBM business partner TexasInstruments of Plano, Texas, has a repository called Encyclopedia within itsInformation Engineering Facility (IEF) Case tool suite.andM;TI's IEF allows for complete life-cycle application development--frombusiness planning through code generation--with an integrated repository, anultimate goal of IBM's AD/Cycle approach.andM;Even Computer Associates, Garden City, N.Y., has countered IBM's announcementwith a software architecture of its own.andP;  Dubbed CA90s, the architectureallows for the integration of CA's multitude of products and forincorporation of IBM's approach.andM;For MIS departments and application developers, the race is toward educationand preparation.andP;  To take advantage of a repository, an organization mustunderstand this technology and be prepared for its introduction.andM;FROM DICTIONARIES TO REPOSITORIESandM;Repository technology is a generation ahead of data dictionary technology.andO;Data dictionaries are concerned with managing the data side of theapplication development process; repositories manage both the data andprocess sides.andP;  Despite the differences, many of the lessons learned fromattempts to introduce data dictionaries into organizations should also applyto repository rollouts.andM;&quot;There are three issues for ensuring the success of a dictionaryimplementation: accessibility and ease of use, accuracy of the informationstored in the dictionary and the ability to locate information.andP;  The sameissues will be true for repository systems,&quot; said David Eddy, vice presidentof marketing for Global Software, Duxbury, Mass.andP;  Global Software marketsadd-on dictionary products for Data Manager, from Manager Software Products,Lexington, Mass.andM;Over the years, many attempts to develop organization-wide dictionary systemshave met with mixed success.andP;  Eddy admitted that &quot;the failure of dictionarysystems has largely been organizational, not technical.&quot;andM;He also suggested that there will be differences between these types ofsystems.andP;  &quot;Data dictionaries were sold to the tekkies, the dataadministration staff or the DBA.andP;  Repositories will be sold to the CEO andMIS directors and down.andP;  Repositories will also be based on relationaltechnology, whereas dictionaries were often built on technologies like Vsam.&quot;andM;It is questionable whether data dictionary systems will survive therepository race.andP;  Independent vendors will have to examine their marketingand development strategies, and consider whether to abandon their ownproprietary formats.andP;  Even then, managing only the data side of the equationmay not be enough.andP;  Vendors whose products are based on relational technologywill have a greater chance for survival.andM;DB2 is an example of a parallel townd toward supporting a standard product.andO;Many independent vendors at first ignored SQL in general, and DB2 inparticular.andP;  Independent DBMS and 4GL vendors were forced to adopt a strategyof interoperability.andP;  These products can still work with their own internaldatabases and formats, but were modified to support a relational approach.andM;Vendors were slow in supporting this approach.andP;  They are not likely to becaught napping this time around with repository technology.andM;DELIVERING ON A PROMISEandM;With its AD/Cycle announcement, IBM has legitimized the need for a repositoryfor its delivery.andP;  IBM's next major frames for its deliver.andP;  IBM's next majormilestone is the delivery of the Information Model, scheduled for releasealong with shipment of Repository Manager/MVS in a June/July time frame.andM;Many questions surround the Information Model.andP;  There has been muchspeculation about what information the models is likely to contain.andP;  Issuesof extensibility and whether an organization should extend the model havebeen widely discussed.andP;  Compatibility with the Ansi IRDS standard is also aquestion.andP;  Finally, the delivery of PC-based components looms as a largeissue for successfully introducing the technology.andM;The Information Model is being designed by the Information Model Council,headed by George Radin of IBM.andP;  The council combines the talent of IBM'sdevelopers with the best architects of IBM's equity partners.andP;  The result,according to Sheldon Borkin, VP of technology for Bachman InformationSystems, is &quot;better than what each of us brought to the table.andP;  The model wedesigned is good enough to serve as a de facto standard.andP;  It will function asa critical Rosetta stone for translating different Case tools.&quot;andM;Jerry Stillman, vice president of Index Technology, agrees.andP;  &quot;The group hadto balance capability versus complexity.andP;  The Information Model conforms towhat each of us can live with and provides a robustness that allows our toolsto interchange information.&quot;andM;Once the first version of the Information Model is finalized, IBM will notify20 to 30 other third-party vendors who are IBM business partners, giving thema head start in developing products that are compliant with the RepositoryManager.andP;  These vendors have received initial reports from the council.andP;  IBMwill conduct seminars with business partners in July.andM;Three submodels comprise the Information Model: the enterprise model, thedesign model and the technology model.andM;The enterprise model contains entities for planning, analysis and businessmodeling.andP;  The design model is utilized for the logical design of a systemand includes entities such as report mock-ups and program structures.andP;  Thetechnology model contains entities that describe the physical implementationof the system, such as DB2 and IMS schemes, language constructs and copylibinformation.andM;The depth to which these entities are defined will determine the robustnessof the initial Repository offering.andP;  Since the industry has much moreexperience with managing the data side of the application developmentprocess, it is widely believed that the data side will be more heavilyrepresented.andM;However, Bachman's Borkin claims that this is not the case.andP;  &quot;The InformationModel will be well-balanced on the process and data side.andP;  It will not be theend-all or be-all, but this first version will have real content and realmeat.andP;  The process side will support process decomposition and dataflowdiagrams [DFDs].&quot;andM;A different view of the Repository comes from William Martorelli, vicepresident of Advanced Software Development for New Science Associates, amarket research firm in Southport, Conn.andP;  &quot;The first iteration will be apassive receptacle for meta-data, which is more data-oriented and will notencompass code generation.andP;  There is a long way to go before the Repositorycan function as a seamless Case integration environment.&quot;andM;A major problem with the process side of application development is thatthere is no standard way of representing processes (a lack of proceduralsemantics).andP;  IBM's answer to this dilemma is known as the External SourceFormat (ESF).andP;  ESF is a TAG-oriented language that allows a fronted designproduct like Excelerator from Index Technology, IEW from KnowledgeWare andBachman's Reengineering Workbench to generate entities that can drive IBM'sgenerator, Cross System Product (CSP).andP;  IBM's equity partners support ESF.andM;For entities that do not exist in the standard Information Model, there isthe option for extensibility.andP;  Opinions on this option vary widely.andM;According to Bob Yellin, VP of product development for Legent Corp.'s BSTDivision in Westborough, Mass., &quot;If you stick with the base InformationModel, you are reduced to the level of least common denominator.andP;  To becompetitive, one will have to extend the model.andP;  This is some cause forconcern, since the Repository promotes the ability to mix and match products.andO;If I use Index's Excelerator on the front end, my code generator on the backend may interpret the Information Model differently.&quot;andM;Barry Glascow, vice president of technical planning for Shearson LehmanHutton, New York, compared the situation to &quot;translating idioms from onelanguage into another.andP;  For example, the definition of subclass andsuperclass in an entity-relationship [E-R] model may differ from one tool toanother.&quot;andM;Index's Stillman acknowledged that private objects and relationships areimportant, but pointed out that care must be taken in how the extensions aremade.andM;&quot;You don't want to overlap functions and reuse entities,&quot; he said.andP;  Thattechnique is similar to the old Cobol trick of having buckets that are usedfor one purpose and then redefining them to use them in another way.&quot;andM;Peter Privateer, director of product programs for KnowledgeWare, describedsuch extensions as &quot;malignant&quot; in his article, &quot;The Do's and Don'ts ofRepository Ties&quot; [Software Magazine, March Special 1990, p. 64].andM;&quot;Benign&quot; extensions define new entities, relationships or attributes.andP;  Theproblem with these types of extensions by a vendor is that other vendors willnot know bout them, which means that cooperative agreements between vendorswill still be needed.andP;  Alternately, these vendors could make their extensionspublic to further promote the idea of an open architecture.andM;IRDS COMPATIBILITYandM;Several years ago, an effort was initiated to define a common repositorystandard.andP;  The result was the Ansi/Fips Information Resource DictionarySystem (IRDS) standard.andP;  IBM's first version of the Repository Manager is notexpected to be IRDS-compliant.andM;According to Harjinder Gill, president of InfoSpan Corporation, Minneapolis,the developers of the only NIST-approved (U.S.andP;  National Institute of Scienceand Technology, formerly the National Bureau of Standards) IRDS-compatibleproduct, &quot;The main problem is that IRDS says that the meta-model is providedby the user, whereas IBM has stated that the model will be fixed.andP;  Inaddition, the IRDS standard requires use of a CML [Command Language], whichis text-driven, to define the meta-model and load the data.&quot;andM;IBM's stated direction is to support IRDS.andP;  However, that support could besix months to a year away.andM;The IRDS standard is an important issue for federal and state governmentagencies.andP;  In Fips Publication #156 (April 5, 1989), the use of alldictionary systems by government agencies was mandated to be Ansi/Fipscompliant.andP;  Given the level of government work performed by IBM, IBM willeither have to comply with IRDS or change the standard.andM;&quot;it is not a matter of how long it will take IBM to becomeAnsi/IRDS-compliant, but rather how long it will take Ansi to redefine theirstandard to be equivalent to IBM's Repository product,&quot; said Kent Lawson,president of Magna Software Corporation, New York.andP;  Magna offers anintegrated product set that includes a customized version of Excelerator andthe company's 4GL/Cobol code generator, Magna, in the IBM and Bullenvironments.andM;Bachman's Borkin does not see lack of IRDS compatibility as a problem,however.andP;  &quot;The Repository has more functionality than the standard.andP;  Thecomprehensiveness of the model is greater than any single customer or vendorcould have built.andP;  This is the best of multiple worlds.&quot;andM;Regardless of whether the Information Model is IRDS-based or not, one aspectof its definition is certain.andP;  Repository Manager will be based on relationaltechnology.andP;  Since AD/Cycle is part of Systems Application Architecture(SAA), the Repository eventually will be available in all SAA-supportedenvironments.andP;  The initial product will be available in the MVS world underTSO or CICS.andP;  The cost will be very high, especially for those who have notyet embraced DB2.andP;  Ultimately, IBM sees the Repository as being distributableacross platforms.andM;In the PC arena, the plans call for an OS/2 Extended Edition version of theRepository, which will work in a cooperative fashion with the mainframeRepository.andP;  IBM's equity partners have agreed to make their productsavailable under OS/2.andP;  However, the significant cost of an OS/2 workstationand the industry's slow acceptance of this environment could slow acceptanceof this approach.andM;According to InfoSpan's Gill, lack of a DOS-based solution is a significantproblem, especially for migration to a repository environment.andP;  &quot;The cost ofthe Repository is way too high if my organization is just moving into thistechnology,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If I have to spend $1 million just to put together afour-seat LAN configuration, the risk of failure is just too great.andP;  It'slike having a sword over my head.andP;  With a DOS-based solution, I spend farless money and, if it doesn't work, I just don't tell anybody.&quot;andM;All the attention that IBM has received with AD/Cycle has diverted the focusfrom DEC's offerings.andP;  DEC has a well-defined strategy with its Repository,CDD/Plus, and Tool services known as ATIS.andP;  DEC views the world as aworldwide enterprise that operates in a distributed, communicationsenvironment on a 24-hour basis.andP;  These organizations need a commonarchitectural backbone for their application development environment built ontop of a network--DEC's Network Application Support (NAS)--regardless ofwhether the customer is commercial, technical/scientific or aerospace.andM;In June, Digital announced that it had formally named its integrated Caseenvironment, Cohesion (Figure 1).andP;  According to DEC, Cohesion enables anorganization to develop, maintain and deploy software for the multivendorenvironment.andM;DEC's architecture has four components: services, standards, integrationframework and tools.andP;  In the standards area, DEC is committed to usingstandards where they are available and championing efforts to createstandards where they are not.andP;  The repository is included in the integrationframework where DEC provides its own Information Model for data and process.andO;At the tool level, DEC intends to offer products that cover the entire lifecycle, such as the methodology tools from Arthur Anderson, Chicago.andM;CDD/Plus started as a data dictionary used by a variety of DEC and non-DECproducts.andP;  Over time, the types of entities that could be stored have grownand DEC has widened the role of CDD/Plus into that of a repository.andP;  Most ofDEC's customers already have the product, since other vendors' productsrequire its use.andM;Today, CDD/Plus is based on DEC's relational database, Rdb, and contains anIRDS-compliant E-R interface.andP;  Mike Dion, vice president of development atSmartStar Corp., Goleta, Calif., one of DEC's cooperative marketing partners(CMPs), sees a relational base as critical: &quot;The repository engine must beflexible enough to accommodate changes.andP;  Relational technology is the onlytechnology which fits the bill.andP;  You also get a big assist from the triggersand integrity constraints found in relational database technology.&quot;andM;A stated goal for the product is to move to an object orientation, which willbe available in the next release, CDD/Repository.andP;  According to RJ.andP;  Mathew,DEC's manager of communications for application development marketing, &quot;Thereis a natural evolution from relational technology to an object-oriented [O-O]environment.&quot;andM;CDD/Repository, which is at the heart of the Cohesion environment, has anobject-oriented interface and is planned for both VMS and Ultrix platforms.andO;It is in test now and will be available the first half of 1991.andM;DEC itself is developing the Information Model for the repository.andP;  Even so,there is a great deal of technical exchange between DEC, its third-partyvendors (CMPs) and DEC's customers.andP;  The Information Model is the most openpart of the architecture and is communicated to all CMPs.andP;  DEC even providesits partners with help in extending the model.andM;When asked to compare DEC's and IBM's strategies, Mathew replied: &quot;I see ourstrategy as being distributed, active, multivendor, open and utilizingstandards.&quot;andM;Active here means that the Repository is accessed and interrogated throughtools.andP;  Another important factor in DEC's favor is that much of this strategyis available today and across DEC's entire product line.andM;Tim Tyler, vice president of software planning for SmartStar Corp., isfamiliar with both IBMhs and DEC's strategies.andP;  He said, &quot;I see theapproaches as being more alike than different.andP;  Both vendors are trying todevelop an all-encompassing environment for the production of software.andP;  Bothare proprietary standards that are trying to lock you into a hardwaresolution at a higher level than previously attempted.&quot;andM;One major difference that Tyler sees between the approaches is that DECoffers more facilities for moving between phases of the life cycle.andP;  &quot;forexample, there is a standard forms definition language [IFDL] which allows aform developed in a product like Excelerator to be stored in CDD/Plus andthen mapped to a physical structure for implementation.andP;  In IBM's AD/Cyclediagram [see Figure 2], there is a line across the top which says 'Cross LifeCycle,' but how will this be accomplished?&quot;andM;SOFTWARE VENDOR RESPONSESandM;From a strategic point of view, software vendors will have several options tochoose from in responding to AD/Cycle and the Repository.andP;  Many vendors willtake a wait-and-see attitude.andP;  The software vendors will position themselvesto take full advantage of the Repository and its Information Model and addfunctionality as it is needed.andM;The strategy outlined by Legent's Yellin for the Endeavor product produced byLegent's BST Division is representative of this approach (Figure 3).andP;  Thestrategy involves four phases:andM;* Use the Repository for storing information;andM;* Use the IBM Repository CPI, when it becomes available;andM;* Extended the Information Model to incorporate vendor-specific entities andrelationships; andandM;* Incorporate the Tools-services level, especially the AD/Cycle workstationplatform.andM;According to Yellin, &quot;Vendors will welcome a standard way and a single placefor storing information, since they can usually do smart processing but arenot as sophisticated about storing data.andP;  They will conform to theoperational aspects of the Repository but not necessarily the InformationModel.&quot;andM;Many vendors are likely to follow the first three phases of this approach.andO;Phase four--the tool level--is where they are likely to differ.andP;  for them,the repository will become plug-compatible with their solutions.andP;  Users willbe able to employ their repository or IBM's repository or DEC's repository.andM;Texas Instruments is embracing this approach.andP;  According to Larry Howard,director of worldwide sales for TI's IEF product, &quot;we don't intent to competeat the repository level, but at the tool level.andP;  The Repository will become ade facto standard and we will support it.andP;  But we have a comprehensiveEncyclopedia today and an integrated environment for developing applications,which AD/Cycle will not have for some time.&quot;andM;John Senor, director of marketing for Information Builders Inc. of New York,whose Focus product spans both the IBM and DEC worlds, voiced similar views:&quot;IBI is committed to both IBM's and DEC's strategies.andP;  Our job is to useFocus as a tool on top of the repository to integrate within a multi-vendorenvironment.&quot;andM;Other software vendors see cross-vendor and cross-platform support as a wayto compete with IBM.andP;  Oracle Corporation, Redwood Shores, Calif., has analready-maturing repository in place, called Case*Dictionary.andP;  Thatrepository, based on Oracle's relational database management system, operatesacross IBM and DEC environments as well as in the Unix world.andM;Perhaps the boldest statements are coming from Computer Associates.andP;  Ca'sarchitecture, CA90s, proposes to accomplish many of the same tasks asAD/Cycle.andP;  It is based on a layered approach that includes multilineplatforms and distributed processing at its core.andP;  CA owns two DMBS products,IDMS and Datacom/DB, which contain the most sophisticated data dictionarieson the market.andM;George Van Schaick, vice president for CA, said, &quot;Our dictionary productstoday exceed the capabilities of IBM's basic Repository.andP;  We are extendingour dictionaries through a Common Repository Interface language which allowsus to use IBM's Repository Manager, CDD/Plus, or our own repository.andO;Furthermore, we have the tools for application development which surround theRepository, IBM doesn't.andP;  Our architecture includes an environment completewith application development systems and 4GLs.&quot;andM;This approach should play well to CA's DBMS clients who are reluctant tothrow away existing systems and move to the relational world of DB2.andM;What all this will mean for users is not quite certain.andP;  Reactions to theAD/Cycle announcements vary from skepticism to enthusiasm.andM;John Voss, senior VP of information resources at the Huntington Bank,Huntington, N.C., has designed and implemented systems using TI's IEFtechnology, is pleased with both the product and its core Encyclopedia(repository).andM;&quot;We are very skeptical of IBM's general Repository approach,&quot; Voss said.andO;&quot;The definition of objects within a single organization is usually ambiguous.andO;Across many organizations it seems impossible to get any agreement.andP;  I alsodo not think IBM can deliver a product satisfying their stated goals andobjectives in the time frames specified.&quot;andM;Undoubtedly, the race toward the Repository will be a long one.andP;  Just as itis true of races, it will also be true that those vendors and developers thatreceive the greatest value from the Repository will not necessarily be theswiftest, but those who keep running the longest.andM;Bernknopf is president of Applied Case Technologies, located in Edison, N.J.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
