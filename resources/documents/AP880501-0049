Four gendarmes were shot and wounded in the latestincident in 10 days of violence.   The separatists called on the United Nations to investigate thisFrench island territory, where seven people have been killed sinceunrest broke out April 22.   Details of the shooting incident were sketchy.   Authorities said the four gendarmes were injured by gunfire nearCanala on the eastern coast of the largest island, La Grande Terre.The officers were evacuated to the capital, Noumea, by helicopterfor treatment at a hospital, authorities said.   They had no other details.   The French High Commission in Noumea, previously the main sourcefor information, said it was ending its regular news briefings forreporters, citing concern for the 21 officers held hostage.   Journalists have not been permitted to travel to Ouvea island,where the hostages were being held in caves.   The chief separatist movement, the Kanak Socialist NationalLiberation Front, said authorities closed down its radiotransmitter, ``increasing the colonial power's total blackout oninformation relating to the current events.''   The front appealed to the United Nations to send a commission ofinquiry to New Caledonia and to ``demand that France furnishinformation and explanations on this war it is waging.''   In its statement, the front said the police held hostage as wellas Melanesian separatists who have been detained should beconsidered ``prisoners of war.''   Monsignor Michel Calvet, archbishop of Noumea, agreed to serveas mediator to try to win freedom for the hostages and flew brieflyto Ouvea.   In a radio interview, Calvet said he agreed to the request fromBernard Pons, minister of overseas territories in the conservativegovernment of Premier Jacques Chirac. Calvet said he said he wasprepared to mediate for the release of the hostages, but not in thepolitical situation.   ``Political negotiations are not within my competence,'' Calvetsaid. ``But I told Bernard Pons I was at his disposition forwhatever could save lives. For the moment, I don't see what can bedone in that direction.''   In Paris, the separatist front's political bureau issued astatement denouncing Calvet's appointment as a ``maneuver.'' Itagain demanded a mediator with authority from Chirac and PresidentFrancois Mitterrand to negotiate a referendum on independence.   ``Only the intervention of a mediator could permit, afterpreliminary discussions, the study of conditions and procedures foran eventual cease-fire as well as for the liberation or exchange ofprisoners,'' the statement said.   The standoff began April 22 when rebels raided a police station,kidnapping 27 gendarmes and killing four others.   Twelve hostages were later released, but eight more officerswere seized when they tried to negotiate the release of theremaining hostages.   Two of those hostages, the head of an anti-terrorism squad andan assistant prosecutor, were freed and ordered to negotiate onbehalf of the terrorists. They were told the remaining hostageswould be killed if the two men did not return to the cave where therebels are hiding out.   Because of the threat, the government said it considers the twoto still be hostages.   The native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent ofthe territory's 145,000 people. About 36 percent of the populationis European, with the rest primarily Asian or Tahitian.   The separatists are fighting a French government plan to givepartial autonomy to New Caledonia. It would remain a Frenchterritory.   The plan was approved last year in a referendum.   Regional assemblies were elected April 24 as part of the Chiracgovernment's initiative. The rebels who seized the hostagesdemanded the annulation of those elections _ held in tandem withthe first round of the French presidential elections _ as well asthe withdrawal of French troops from Ouvea island and appointmentof a mediator to negotiate terms for a new referendum onindependence.</TEXT></DOC>
