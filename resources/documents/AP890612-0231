But it's a controversial vision that makes some peoplenervous.   With little money available to sink into education, Bush ispromoting concepts that may help him fulfill his campaign pledge tobe the ``education president'' without making new demands on thefederal treasury _ choice foremost among them.   At a White House workshop held before he took office, Bush calledpublic school choice ``the single most promising idea'' in educationtoday. And Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos refers to choice as thecornerstone of education reform.   Against this backdrop of high-level exhortation, scores ofdistricts and state legislatures across the country are enacting orat least discussing various types of open enrollment plans.   Some, like Minnesota's pioneering plan, allow parents to chooseschools in any district in the state while others, such as a highlysuccessful East Harlem, N.Y., program, are confined to a singledistrict. Some plans rely heavily on magnet schools. Some providetransportation and others do not.   A major defeat occurred in New Mexico when a state Senatecommittee killed a statewide choice plan. But setbacks have been theexception, not the rule.   At least two states, Arkansas and Iowa, have followed Minnesota'slead and enacted open enrollment programs allowing students toattend any school in the state. Nearly two dozen states this yearwere studying or considering similar comprehensive choice proposalsor narrower ones that apply to dropouts, upperclassmen or at-riskstudents.   In a series of steps designed to fuel the movement, Cavazosappointed a special adviser and task force to promote and evaluatechoice projects. He said he would hold regional conferences onchoice strategies and give top priority to choice projects inawarding education innovation grants.   The theory behind public school choice is that it gives parentsmore control over their children's education and at the same timecreates competition that will theoretically shake up and improve badschools.   But reactions among educators and even parents have been mixed.Some predict logistical nightmares and soaring transportation costs;others wonder if it is possible to ensure equity under an openenrollment system _ whether some inner-city schools will bevirtually abandoned to those least able to take advantage of theirnew options.   ``It's a very complicated issue,'' Harvard education professorSara Lawrence Lightfoot said recently. ``We have to think aboutmaking knowledge about schools available to everyone.''   Lightfoot said the concern is that better educated, higher statuspeople will have more information and make better choices for theirchildren. She described a scenario where ``the brighter, morecapable, more affluent people are drawn to a certain setting. Thecream is taken from the milk and the others are left behind.''   Leaders of the two teacher unions have expressed cautiousoptimism about school choice, provided there are safeguards to makesure deprived children are not further penalized. Some of thestrongest reservations are found among administrators and schoolboard presidents.   A survey of the board presidents earlier this year found thatonly 36 percent believed parents should be able to select theirchild's school; that compares to 71 percent of the public whosupported the idea in a 1987 Gallup poll.   ``In essence, the secretary's approach would do the least forthose who have the least,'' charged Richard Miller, executivedirector of the American Association of School Administrators, afterCavazos had announced his choice initiatives.   In a speech this year to newspaper editors, Cavazos made aspecial point of saying any public school choice program must be``very, very sensitive to equity in the system'' by upgrading ghettoschools and making transportation available to poor students who optto go elsewhere.   If schools are unacceptable, he said, states should take themover or shut them down.   Several weeks later he told education writers that districts arealready spending enormous amounts of money and should divert some ofit to transportation if they are serious about choice.   The Minnesota plan does not provide transportation. However,Cavazos remarked that some of the students there ``would drive 100miles on their own to go to the school of their choice.''   Cavazos is fervent about school choice at least partly because heconsiders himself an early beneficiary of the idea. Where he grew upon a Texas ranch, he said, there were three local schools _ one forblacks, one for Hispanics and one for Anglos.   ``The Anglo (school) had the best education program, anyone couldsee it,'' he told education writers this year. So his father, theranch foreman, got Cavazos and his siblings into the Anglo school.``How he did it, I don't know,'' the secretary said. ``I considerthat to be the first example of choice.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Editor's note: Jill Lawrence covers education for the AP fromWashington.</TEXT></DOC>
