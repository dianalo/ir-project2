Exxon operating profit in the first quarter rose slightlyalthough one-time items caused its net income to decline 29%.Amoco profit rose 1.7%.</LP><TEXT>   Amoco said it paid an average of $20.79 a barrel for oilin the quarter, more than $3 higher than a year ago. Becausecrude oil is a raw material for so-called downstreamoperations, chemical earnings were off sharply for bothcompanies, and gasoline refining and marketing profits wereweaker. Exxon and Amoco are the first major oil companies toreport first-quarter results, and other companies' earningsare expected to follow the same pattern.   Analysts say Exxon turned in a better first-quarterperformance than anticipated with its foreign exploration andproduction business making a particularly strong showing.Results &quot;were better than what we were looking for,&quot; saidFrederick Leuffer, analyst for C.J. Lawrence Inc. Still,Exxon lost 62.5 cents in composite trading yesterday on theNew York Stock Exchange to close at $45.75 a share.   Exxon reported net income of $1.28 billion, or $1.01 ashare, compared with $1.81 billion, or $1.41 a share, duringthe same period last year. But the year-earlier quarterlyprofit included a $535 million gain related to an accountingchange. Revenue grew by 20% to $26.7 billion.   Profitability was marred somewhat by the U.S. refining andmarketing business, which reported a loss of $28 million downfrom earnings of $37 million. Exxon explained some of this bysaying that results in the U.S. were unfavorably affected bythe partial loss of operating capacity at the Baton Rougerefinery following a major explosion and fire last December.   Missing in the quarter's results were any additionalcharges related to cleaning up the spill caused when one ofExxon's tankers rammed an underwater reef and dumped almost11 million gallons into Prince William Sound last year. Lastyear Exxon took $1.38 billion in charges stemming fromcleanup of its giant Alaskan oil spill.   Exxon made no reference in its current earnings report tothe oil spill, which has made it the pariah of the industry.But analysts say they don't expect the company to take anyadditional charges related to cleanup efforts, which are toresume in Alaska on May 1. &quot;I think Exxon has probablyoverreserved&quot; for the upcoming cleanup effort, said BryanJacoboski, analyst for PaineWebber Group Inc.   In the first quarter, Exxon, New York, purchased 2.2million shares of its own stock at a cost of $104 million.Analysts noted that the buy-back rate has slowed to itslowest level in more than seven years. They speculated thatsome of the money typically used for stock repurchases wasshifted into capital spending, which grew by 5% excluding the$3.9 billion acquisition of Texaco Canada. The growth inspending, albeit small, indicates &quot;a more aggressive,healthier approach&quot; for the company, Mr. Jacoboski said.   Amoco said net rose to $466 million, or 91 cents a share,from $458 million, or 89 cents a share. The 1989 firstquarter included a special charge of $57 million forconsolidation activities. Revenue rose 9% to $7.13 billionfrom $6.52 billion.   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Amoco fell 75cents to $50.25 a share.   Like Exxon, Amoco's exploration and production earningssurged, to $295 million from $203 million. Despite highernatural gas prices in the quarter, Amoco reduced its naturalgas production, as did many producers when the price fellsharply after the unusually bitter cold ended by February.   Chicago-based Amoco said its chemical earnings fell 49% to$80 million. The company said margins were lower, as theyhave been for a number of quarters. A combination of higherprices for crude -- the feedstock for petrochemicals -- withlower chemical prices is behind the profit decline.   With gasoline refining and marketing profit of $111million in the quarter, results were down just slightly from$114 million.   Separately, Ashland Oil Inc., Ashland, Ky., by and large agasoline refiner and marketer without its own crude oilproduction, had a weak quarter. It had net of $913,000, ortwo cents a share, compared with a loss of $13.8 million, or25 cents a share, which included a $9 million charge. Salesrose to $1.97 billion from $1.78 billion.   Amerada Hess Corp., New York, said net fell to $39.7million, or 49 cents a share, from $220.2 milllion, or $2.70a share. Amerada Hess earnings fell so sharply in partbecause of its accounting method, which analysts say cutsinto reported earnings when crude prices fall during aquarter, as they did in the first period.</TEXT></DOC>
