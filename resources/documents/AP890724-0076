(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man wanted in a fatal shooting in anOklahoma flower shop and suspected in five more killings in threeother states was arrested at a hospital emergency room.   Michael Frank Greene, 37, was arrested Sunday at Comanche CountyMemorial Hospital, where he had gone for treatment of a backinjury. He was held today in an Ardmore jail.   District Attorney Fred Collins said one count of first-degreemurder, two counts of shooting with intent to kill and two countsof robbery with a firearm were filed against Greene in theshootings of three women in a flower shop in Ardmore, about 100miles southeast of Lawton.   Greene also is a suspect in the killing of a photo processingshop owner in Pampa, Texas, and the killings of two conveniencestore clerks in Garden City, Kan., said Carter County DistrictAttorney Gary Henry.   ``There is physical evidence linking all of the murders,'' saidpolice Capt. Ron Rardin of Garden City. ``I can't say much morethan that, but the evidence points that way.''   Capt. Stan Wojdylak of the Garden City Police Department saidthis morning, however, that officers were en route to Raton, N.M.,to question a suspect in a shooting there. Ardmore detectives alsowere en route to New Mexico.   ``The Garden City Police Department has never really formallysaid the suspect in custody (in Oklahoma) was responsible for theshootings here in Garden City. There was a shooting overnight inNew Mexico, and we have officers en route there now,'' Wojdylaksaid.   Henry said the slayings were ``within a day's drive and occurredon three successive days and the manner of the killing and the ...weapon used appears similar.''   Meanwhile, in Merrillville, Ind., police said the slayings oftwo motel clerks earlier this year may be related to the killingsin Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.   Investigators with the Jasper County, Ind., sheriff's office onSunday told The Daily Oklahoman in Oklahoma City that new leads inthe March 3 deaths led them to Greene as a suspect. They did notelaborate.   Indiana and Kansas investigators have tentatively set a meetingnext week to discuss the killings in both states, which are``strikingly similar,'' said Capt. Bob Hicks of the Jasper Countysheriff's office in Indiana.   In the slayings in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, all four victimswere shot in the back of the head, said Les Weaver, a Texas highwaypatrol dispatcher.   The killings started early Wednesday in Garden City, whenBarbara Kochendorfer, 27, and Mary Rains, 28, were abducted fromconvenience stores on opposite sides of the western Kansas city.Their bodies were found hours later.   On Thursday, Edley Perry Spurrier was found dead in the photoprocessing shop he ran in Pampa, in the Texas panhandle.   In Ardmore, Gwen Miller was killed Friday and two other womenwere wounded. Police speculated the shootings occurred during arobbery.   Ardmore Assistant Police Chief David Willingham said one of thesurvivors of the Oklahoma shootings, Joann Bean, identified Greenefrom photographs as the man who shot her, Miller and Mary Manning.   Ms. Bean was listed in good condition Sunday at an Oklahoma Cityhospital, while Ms. Manning was in serious but stable condition atanother Oklahoma City hospital.   Dr. Scott Malowney, the Ardmore medical examiner, said theshootings were ``almost ritualistic'' and ``more like anassassination than a shooting.''   Officials said ``less than $100'' was taken from the flower shop.   Authorities said a tip led them to Greene at the hospital inLawton, which is about 80 miles southwest of Oklahoma City.   Greene's father, Hank, of Inola, Okla., said his son has beenmarried twice, has five children, and moved to Inola about a yearago. He said his son's wife recently filed for divorce and movedthe family to Pampa, Texas, where her parents live.   Hank Greene said he was glad his son had been caught.   ``At least I know there isn't going to be anymore stuff going onby him ... God in heaven, I would have bet my life he didn't doit,'' he said Sunday after learning of his son's arrest.   ``I hung on by a thin thread he wasn't implicated in it. I'venever experienced anything like this with that much terriblehurt,'' he said. ``It was all uncalled for. He wasn't raised likethat.''   Michael Greene's prior criminal history includes 1984 boguscheck conviction and a 1977 forgery conviction, Collins said.</TEXT></DOC>
