The maker of glass, chemicals and coatings, which has nearly 120 million common shares outstanding, said the buy-back will be funded by proceeds from operations and the divestiture of businesses that aren't meeting its strategic objectives. The company wouldn't elaborate.    The timing and extent of stock repurchases will depend on market conditions and may be made in the open market or in private transactions, the company said. The repurchased stock will be used for general corporate purposes. </TEXT></DOC>
