The radio said Tehran had successfully negotiated with captorsmany times, an apparent reference to the freeing of two Americanhostages last month by pro-Iranian Lebanese groups in the past twoweeks.   ``In the end, it is the policies of the Western governments,especially America, which have blocked such efforts, and notallowed all the hostages to return to the arms of their families,''said the radio, monitored in Nicosia.   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said Thursday that Americaneducators Robert Polhill, 55, and Frank Reed, 57, were released bytheir Lebanese captors at Iran's bidding. Polhill had spent 39months in captivity, Reed, 43 months.   Most of the 16 Western captives are believed held by pro-IranianShiite Moslem groups.   The longest-held of the hostages in Lebanon is Terry Anderson,42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. Hewas kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985.   Both Iran and Syria _ which also helped negotiate the hostagereleases _ are thought seeking closer ties with the West to helprebuild flagging economies, Iran's shattered by war.   Rafsanjani branded the Bush administration a ``stubborn,frustrated child'' for refusing to make a goodwill gesture to Iranfollowing the two releases.   President Bush has said he won't negotiate the captives'release. But on Thursday he said he was trying to encourage therelease of American hostages by helping Iran determine the fate offour Iranians who disappeared in Lebanon in 1982.   ``If that is goodwill, so be it,'' Bush said.   Israel is holding 300 to 400 Lebanese Shiite prisoners,including Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a pro-Iranian cleric abducted byIsraeli commandos in Lebanon in July 1989. Iran holds ChristianPhalangist militiamen responsible for the disappearance of the fourIranians last seen in Beirut in 1982.   The radio made no mention of Bush's offer.   Saturday's Tehran radio commentary said Washington was tornbetween not wanting to be seen negotiating with Iran and needing torestore relations with Teharan.   ``The Bush administration ... is engaged in anti-Iranianpolicies to distance itself from so-called negotiations or deal,''the state radio said. ``It is clear that America needs to resumerelations with Iran, which is a strong and strategic country in theMiddle East.''   ``American actions, its contradictory statements and hollowmedia statements either show Washington's confusion in adopting acorrect stance to solve this crisis, or it must be said the Bushadmnistration favors the hostage crisis to continue,'' the radiosaid.   It said Washington was trying to blame others for not releasingthe hostages ``to ease public pressure, which wants the governmentto provide the grounds for release of the other hostages,'' theradio said.   In a related development, a Tehran newspaper on Saturdaycriticized the British government for its handling of relationswith Iran.   The newspaper Jomhuri Islami, which usually backs theanti-Western elements within the Iranian government, said Britishpolitical leaders made no effort to explore the roots of the badrelations between London and Tehran.   Meanwhile, in Beirut, the spiritual mentor of Moslem militantsholding Western hostages said no more captives should be freedunless Israel releases Arab prisoners, a newspaper reportedSaturday.   ``We want the states of the world to pressure Israel intoreleasing Arab prisoners the same way they exert pressure for therelease of Western hostages,'' al-Anwar quoted Sheik MohammedHussein Fadlallah as telling a Friday prayer sermon.</TEXT></DOC>
