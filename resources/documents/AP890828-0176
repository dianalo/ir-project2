U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene agreed to dropallegations of a conspiracy by Poindexter and others to illegallydivert funds to the Contras from the Reagan administration's secretarms sales to Iran.   Remaining in the indictment are allegations that Poindexterconspired to obstruct Congress, make false statements and destroyofficial documents in the Iran-Contra scandal. His allegedco-conspirators were former White House aide Oliver North andbusinessmen Richard Secord and Albert Hakim. North enlisted Secord'shelp in running arms to the Contras during a congressional ban inmilitary aid to the Nicaraguan rebel force.   Poindexter also is accused of two counts of obstruction ofCongress and two counts of making false statements to Congress.Those counts relate to denials that North was assisting the Contrasand denials that Poindexter knew that Hawk missiles were aboard aNovember 1985 shipment to Iran.   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, whose office is prosecutingPoindexter, had sought to abandon portions of the conspiracy chargeto avoid problems relating to the disclosure of classifiedinformation.   U.S. intelligence agencies in the North trial were concerned thattoo much material relating to sensitive national security matterswould come out in court in a trial of the conspiracy charge relatingto the diversion of funds.   The Justice Department has the power to file an affidavitprohibiting disclosure of such sensitive information, an actionwhich could lead to dismissal of some or all of the criminal chargesin a case.</TEXT></DOC>
