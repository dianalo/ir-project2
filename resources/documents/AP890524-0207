George Deukmejian signed two bills sparked by aschoolyard massacre.   The bills ban the sale of 55 semiautomatic assault rifles,pistols and shotguns beginning Jan. 1. But they allow people whocurrently own those weapons lawfully to keep them if they registerwith the state.   The legislation was prompted by a Jan. 17 attack at a Stocktonelementary school in which a deranged man with an AK-47 assaultrifle killed five children and wounded 30 other people beforetaking his own life.   The attack prompted similar bills in several states, includingRhode Island, Louisiana, Michigan and Colorado, but California'sare the first to be passed and signed into law. The Louisiana billfailed in committee Wednesday, and lawmakers there say it isunlikely any gun control legislation will be adopted this year.   Several cities, including Los Angeles, have enacted localrestrictions.   ``These bills are not going to bring back to life the fivebeautiful children who were killed on the schoolyard in Stockton,''Deukmejian said during a Capitol bill-signing ceremony. ``I hopethey will help our courageous law enforcement community in fightingviolent crime.''   Deukmejian, a Republican who is a longtime foe of gun controlmeasures, said he would also sign legislation requiring a 15-daywaiting period for all gun sales, but stressed that he stillopposes any further gun control.   ``This legislation only bans specified weapons that are notneeded by individuals for their self-protection or recreationpurposes. They can still go hunting, they can still go targetshooting with many other guns,'' Deukmejian said.   Despite those assurances, Deukmejian's signing of the two bills,written by two Los Angeles Democrats, Senate President Pro TemDavid Roberti and Assemblyman Mike Roos, sparked immediate recallthreats.   A lone picket stood in front of the Capitol with a sign saying``Impeach Anti-Gun Traitors'' during the bill signing, and agun-owners group announced a recall drive against Deukmejian.   The governor said he wasn't surprised or worried about therecall threats.   Roberti said he hoped California's restrictions will ``be aleadership action (showing) what can be accomplished inWashington.''   ``I pledge this is just a beginning,'' said Roos. ``Todayclearly shows California's watershed position for the country whenit comes to crime control and control of violent weapons thatpeople unfortunately have had too easy access to.''</TEXT></DOC>
