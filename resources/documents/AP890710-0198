By then the UMW was down to 65,000 dispirited membersmining only 45 percent of America's coal, the rest mined bynon-union workers. The UMW, the nation's seminal industrial unionand once its wealthiest, was operating $400,000-a-month in the red.   A 40-year-old lawyer and third-generation miner, Trumka brought afresh outlook and a new dynamic to the union. He negotiated acontract in 1984 without an industrywide strike, the first one in 20years. He did it again in 1988, all the while building up a $100million strike fund.   He also won authority within the union to call ``selective''strikes against specific companies, such as Pittston, which withdrewfrom industrywide bargaining and refused to sign the 1988 contract.   ``Richard Trumka's ideas have won us two national agreements,''says Purkey, ``so you have to believe that his way is the way to go.If that means non-violent civil disobedience, that's it.   ``We now have a small income while we're striking, $200 a week,and health benefits. The wildcat strikers don't get that, just theselective strikers because our strike is authorized.   ``But every man has to show up on schedule and participate, justlike we were working. We are better organized than in any strikeI've been in and I've been in them all since I started in the minesin 1971.   ``We're holding rallies and demonstrations and marches _ acompletely different strategy, and it takes some getting used to.Some thought the old ways were better, but now we all see that thisis better.''   Apparently the non-violent philosophy takes some getting used toby others than the strikers.   At a recent court hearing in Logan, the district court judge,Eric O'Briant, made reference to the mine workers' ``highlysophisticated effort to peacefully prohibit trucks'' from driving upPittston's mine road at Slab Fork.   The Pittston lawyer replied, ``...admittedly peaceful, albeit noless disruptive.''   In West Virginia's coal fields there is something almost quaintabout words such as ``peaceful'' and ``sophisticated,'' especiallyin Logan County, where in recent memory strike tactics have beenabout as sophisticated as a stick of dynamite.   ``You have to remember our history,'' says Low Coal Chapman.``This is where the hardest of the hard times began.''   Chapman explains that his parents named him Robert, ``but if youask for me by that name nobody will know who you're talking about.Just ask for Low Coal.''   It is a miner's term for a thin seam of coal, maybe 40 inchesthick, where it takes unusual stooping and bending and crawling todig it out. Low Coal Chapman stands about 5-5.   He was referring to an episode at nearby Blair Mountain in 1921when company detectives, sheriff's deputies and federal troopsopened fire on miners marching down from Charleston to organize theunion in Logan County. Twenty-four were killed.   Chapman, on strike at age 50, often hikes up the dirt road to thetop of Blair Mountain to reinforce his resolve. The view ispulse-quickening and serene, offering no hint of the turmoil andtension below.   ``The men didn't make it over the mountain but their spiritdid,'' says Chapman. ``We're the children of that vision. I wantthat dirt road to be named The Road to Solidarity.''   Chapman was born and raised on Buffalo Creek, on the other sideof a mountain from Slab Fork. Buffalo Creek was where in 1972 afaulty dam burst and wiped out the entire hollow. The torrent left124 dead and 4,000 homeless. Chapman's parents, two sisters andbrother and their families were among the 4,000.   ``Nobody has forgotten,'' he says, ``that it was a Pittston damthat broke.''   ``Low Coal is right about that,'' says Bethel Purkey. ``We have alot to resent about Pittston, them and their security guards.They're trying to provoke us into doing something that will land usin jail.''   The security guards, a private firm, watch over the pickets,continually filming them with movie cameras. Pittston says, however,that the purpose is not to intimidate.   At first the miners took the filming in good humor. One posed forthe camera in a Groucho Marx get-up. Others barked and cavorted likepuppies. Lately, however, it seems to have become less of a jokinmatter.   ``They've followed me home, filmed my house,'' Purkey claims.``They even filmed our ladies auxiliary at a meeting at the school.What's that got to do with the strike?''   Attempts to reach Pittston spokesmen for comment in West Virginiaand at the company headquarters in Greenwich, Conn., were notsuccessful. Repeated telephone calls were not returned.   ``There have been times, buddy, when you're tempted to beviolent,'' said one of the pickets at Slab Fork, Dave Thompson,whittling a stick, listening in the silence for the sound of anapproaching truck. ``Sometimes it's hard to keep yourself incontrol.''   ``We're determined to see this through with non-violence,''Purkey says. ``But like I say, you can only push a man so far.   ``You keep twisting the screw, twisting, twisting, at some pointthat banjo string will break.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 23</NOTE></DOC>
