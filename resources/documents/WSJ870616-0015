The buyout will be led by the supermarket company's management and New York-based First Boston Corp. The Rosenberg family, which controls 70% of Big V's voting rights, agreed to the transaction, the company said.    &quot;The family has a responsibility to itself for estate tax purposes and for personal reasons,&quot; said A. Richard Rosenberg, chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;There's always a time to take some money off the table.&quot;    Mr. Rosenberg, members of his family and a family partnership have agreed to sell about 2.5 million Class B shares of the company's total of 6.3 million Class A and B shares outstanding.    Big V said its board and a special committee of outside directors have approved the buyout, and that it expects to hold a special meeting in September for shareholders to approve the transaction.    The company said First Boston has created BV Holdings Corp. to acquire Big V, which operates 33 supermarkets under the Shop-Rite name mostly in the Hudson Valley region of New York State.    In 1986, the company created a second class of stock, the Class B shares, with four times the voting power of Class A shares. The Rosenberg family subsequently converted its holdings to the Class B stock.    Under terms of the agreement, the company said it will omit its regular third-quarter dividend. The company has been paying quarterly dividends of 11 cents a share on its Class A stock and nine cents a share on its Class B.    If the transaction is approved, the closely held company will operate under the same name. Mr. Rosenberg will remain as chairman and David G. Bronstein, who is president and chief operating officer of Big V, will remain as president and will assume the chief executive title.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Big V Class A shares rose $1.25 to close at $20.375. </TEXT></DOC>
