Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega on Tuesday announced therelease of 29 peasant farmers jailed for allegedcounter-revolutionary activities and said his government woulddecide the fates of an additional 1,200 political prisoners by earlySeptember.   The gesture appeared designed to encourage anti-governmentguerrillas to lay down their arms in the wake of an agreement amongCentral American presidents to disband U.S.-backed Contra rebelsbased in Honduras. The agreement calls for the demobilization thisfall so long as Managua moves toward democratic reform.   The State Department spokesman said ``the release of politicalprisoners is always a welcome development.'' But he said Nicaragua,by continuing to hold political prisoners, was violating anagreement reached two years ago among Central American presidents.   ``The continuing imprisonment of political prisioners inNicaragua is a violation of the Esquipulas Agreement, which requiredsignatories to issue decrees of amnesty, which I quote, `shallestablish all the provisions to guarantee the inviolability of life,freedom in all its forms, property and the security of the personsto whom such decrees apply,''' said Boucher.</TEXT></DOC>
