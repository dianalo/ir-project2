No one was hurt or killed in the blasts, but state authoritieslater imposed a curfew and banned all public assembly, includingFriday prayer services, forcing tens of thousands of Moslem sabbathworshipers to stay indoors.   Moslem militants have been demanding for more than four decadesthat Jammu-Kashmir state break away from predominantly Hindu India.   The latest flareup erupted last month with clashes betweenIndian security forces and the militants and at least 82 peoplehave been killed, officials say.   A bomb exploded in a bus parked at the city terminal, adjacentto the tourist information center, officials said. Two other buseswere damaged but no one was hurt, they said.   Another bomb exploded in a neighborhood post office, but therewere no casualties, said the district magistrate of Srinagar,Ghulam Abbas.   Most of the victims have been protesters shot while defying acurfew imposed Jan. 20 by government forces to stem rising violence.   In recent days, authorities had relaxed the curfew duringdaytime hours, but it was re-imposed following the bomb blasts.   After Moslems were told they would not be allowed to attendservices, the city's chief Moslem priest denounced the decision andcalled on Moslem leaders worldwide to force the Indian governmentto allow the gatherings.   ``I strongly condemn the anti-Islamic act of state authoritiesto impose day curfew consistently on Fridays for the last twomonths to make jumma (Friday) prayers impossible,'' Moulvi MohammadFarooq said in a statement.   Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India andPakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the endof British colonial rule in 1947. Srinagar and the surroundingareas of the valley became part of Jammu-Kashmir, India's onlypredominantly Moslem state.   Sixty-four percent of the state's 5 million people are Moslems,but nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of the 880 millionpopulation.   Kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union withPakistan, which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslempopulation, but now demand independence and the status of a neutralcountry.   India routinely blames neighoring Pakistan of arming, trainingand supporting the militants. Pakistan denies the charge but saysthe Kashmiri people have a right to self-determination.   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the region.</TEXT></DOC>
