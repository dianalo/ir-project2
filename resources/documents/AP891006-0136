A Palestinian guerrilla spokesman linked the abductions to aLebanese Shiite Moslem hijacker imprisoned in Switzerland.   The victims were identified as Emmanuel Christen, 32, and ElioErriquez, 23, orthopedic technicians at an artificial limb centeroperated by the International Committee of the Red Cross in Sidon,25 miles south of Beirut.   None of Lebanon's armed factions claimed responsibility.   Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are missing inLebanon, most believed to be captives of Shiite Moslems loyal toIran. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Friday's abductions were the latest of several involvingforeigners working for relief agencies in south Lebanon. Most areblamed on Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a Palestinian group led byterrorist Abu Nidal, who broke with PLO chairman Yassir Arafat in1973.   Zeid Wehbeh, spokesman for the Palestine LiberationOrganization, said the PLO would ``spare no effort'' to help rescuethe victims.   Moein Shabaita, spokesman for Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, thePLO's main guerrilla component, linked the kidnappings to aLebanese Shiite Moslem hijacker, Mohammed Hariri.   Hariri was jailed for life in February for hijacking an AirAfrique jetliner July 24, 1987, and killing a French passengerafter the plane landed in Geneva.   Shabaita said the group that kidnapped Christen and Erriquez wasthe same that abducted Swiss Red Cross worker Peter Winkler lastyear, ``apparently for the purpose of trying to win Hariri'srelease.''   Winkler was kidnapped Nov. 17 and freed Dec. 16.   People in Sidon reported seeing a convoy of seven Red Cross carswith Swiss officials inside heading for Beirut in late afternoon.Red Cross officials would not say whether the InternationalCommittee, which is based in Geneva, would pull out of Lebanon asit did last year after another kidnapping.   Sidon police said Christen and Erriquez were seized at 7:30 a.m.after arriving at the artificial limb center, which occupies theground floor of a four-story building near Ein el-Hilweh, aPalestinian refugee camp on the southeastern outskirts.   The relief workers drove there from the InternationalCommittee's downtown headquarters, half a mile away, in a whitesedan identified by the Red Cross insignia on each side and a RedCross flag, police reported.   Armed kidnappers wearing black masks waited in two cars outsidethe center, said a police spokesman, whose name was withheld understanding regulations.   ``Christen, who was driving, parked outside the center andclimbed out, holding an artificial limb. Erriquez got out the otherdoor, followed by a Lebanese ICRC employee,'' he said.   Two kidnappers jumped from a car, one brandishing a pistol andthe other a submachine gun, the spokesman reported.   ``Christen and Erriquez put their hands up, offering noresistance,'' he said. They were bundled at gunpoint into the trunkof the gunmen's Mercedes, which sped off, followed by the other carpacked with gunmen.   He said several witnesses saw the two cars racing into Einel-Hilweh.   International Committee spokesman Jeorg Bischof said in Genevathe abduction ``hinders the very important work the Red Cross isdoing in Lebanon.''   Police said the orthopedic center, which provides artificiallimbs for victims of Lebanon's 14-year-old sectarian civil war, wasclosed indefinitely after the abduction.   Christen, in Lebanon since October 1987, had told friends:``I've been here so long because I love it. I don't intend to askfor a transfer.''   Erriquez, who arrived in April, told colleagues: ``Theexperience of working here will be good for me.''   At least nine relief agency workers _ West Germans,Scandinavians, Belgians and Swiss _ have been kidnapped in southLebanon during the past two years.   Police and other sources have blamed Abu Nidal, whose real nameis Sabry al-Banna. He has bases at Ein el-Hilweh and in the smallerMieh Mieh refugee camp nearby.   Mustafa Saad, commander of the Nasserite militia, a Sunni Moslemgroup that has controlled Sidon throughout the civil war, blamedPalestinians for the latest abduction but was not more specific.   ``This is an Ein el-Hilweh affair, not mine,'' he told reportersafter a 10-minute meeting with Roland Sidler, the InternationalCommittee's director in south Lebanon.   Sidler would not talk to reporters.   Saad ordered his militiamen to search all cars leaving Sidon.   The International Committee withdrew its 31 Swiss nationals fromLebanon on Dec. 20 after death threats from factions that were notidentified.   Press reports in Switzerland and Lebanon said Winkler'skidnappers, not identified, had threatened more attacks on Swissworkers, claiming Swiss authorities reneged on a pledge to payransom for Winkler.   A 29-member Swiss group returned Jan. 22 after all Lebanesefactions promised there would be no attacks on humanitarianorganizations.</TEXT></DOC>
