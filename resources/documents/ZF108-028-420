said Bob Metcalfe, founder of and vice president ofmarketing for 3Com Corp., in Santa Clara, Calif.andP;  &quot;Our planning is based onthe economy not moving next year.&quot;andM;In 1989, stars like Sun Microsystems Inc., Leading Edge Products Inc.,andO;Mini-Scribe Corp. and Ashton-Tate fell to earth, victims of poor businssmanagement or an inability to deliver promised products on time.andP;  Even hardchargers like Microsoft Corp., Compaq Computer Corp. and IBM were chastenedby declining earnings or had to face Wall Street and revise estimates.andM;In the decade ahead, marketing savvy will be even more critical thantechnological expertise, said Steve Lair, director of the PC group atDataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif., consulting firm.andM;&quot;Those companies that know how to market will win&quot; in the '90s, said Lair,who predicts that the world's 450 PC makers will be pared to just 50 by theend of the decade.andM;While marketing may be a priority for PC makers, the ever more complextechnology will be the chief concern of computer dealers and distributors inthe next decade.andM;After a year of mergers and acquisitions, the distribution channel faces moreof the same as resellers consolidate along technology lines.andP;  Since not alldealers can afford to support the latest high-ticket technology products,they are aligning themselves in distinct technology camps--some specializingin networks, others distinguishing themselves on price and volume.andM;&quot;the '90s is a whole different picture from a distribution standpoint,&quot; saidEd Anderson, executive vice president and chief operating officer ofCamputerLand Corp., in Pleasanton, Calif.andP;  &quot;We're flirting with networks andnetworkwide computing.andM;&quot;It's not a slowdown--it's a shift in the type of business we do,&quot; he added.andM;Most executives say that shift is being driven by high-end PC-based servers,which are spearheading the evolution of client/server computing.andP;  &quot;BEfore, wewere selling productivity workstations,&quot; said Rick Inatome, president and CEOof Inacomp Computer Centers Inc., of Troy, Mich.andP;  &quot;Now we will be sellingsophisticated systems into mission-critical applications.&quot;andM;Resellers who offer customers complete solutions for mission-criticalclient/server applications and advanced networking will prosper in the '90s,even if the economy slows, according to industry executives.andP;  These systemswill replace old minicomputer technology and provide a base for newnetwork-based applications, they said.andM;&quot;People are going to be rechanneling a lot of effort and investment to suitthis new environment,&quot; said Inatome.andM;In the thick of the client/server software battle will be Oracle Corp., withits Oracle Server for OS/2 up against the Microsoft/Sybase SQL Server.andM;&quot;This is going to be an incredible dog-fight,&quot; said Thomas Siebel, group vicepresident and general manager of Oracle's direct marketing division inBelmont, Calif.andM;For the software industry, new-user sales may weaken, but executives predictindustry growth will be fueled by replacement sales, as users upgrade tosoftware that supports a graphical user interface.andM;&quot;1990 is going to be a great year,&quot; said Pete Peterson, executive vicepresident of WordPerfect Corp., in Orem, Utah.andP;  &quot;We're finally going to getOS/2 and Windows 3.0 out there, and people will finally be able to makebuying decisions rather than strategic planning decisions.&quot;andM;Jon Shirley, president of Microsoft in Redmond, Wash., and chief proponent ofMicrosoft's OS/2, agrees.andP;  &quot;At the end of 1990, people will look back and besurprised at the amount of OS/2 software that has come out and the level ofacceptance of OS/2,&quot; he said.andM;But other software executives argue that Windows will come on strong in 1990and OS/2 won't become important until 1991 or 1992.andP;  Still others contendthat in 1990, corporate purchasers will be so overwhelmed by the selection ofoperating systems and environments that they'll choose to sit on the fencerather than play the game.andM;&quot;The disruption of the PC standard, as healthy as it may be, has a price,&quot;said Fred Gibbons, president and CEO of Software Publishing Corp., inMountain View, Calif.andP;  &quot;And the price is that the customer is going to waitfor ...andP;  the best of the breed to emerge.&quot;andM;Wall Street's critical view of technology companies is also constrictingcapital for startups, said John Bayless, a partner with Sevin Rosen BaylessManagement Co., a Dallas venture partnership.andP;  Previously, a technologycompany with $20 million in revenue and a good profit record could make aninitial public stock offering, but now it takes $30 million to $50 million inrevenue, said Bayless.andM;Bayless added that the slow return on investments is also reducing investorinterest in venture funds.andP;  &quot;We've seen a couple of instances wherepartnerships are breaking up or not going forward with new funds,&quot; he said.andO;Many banks have withdrawn from the venture market in the last few years.andM;As foreign investment infiltrates the PC industry, events like Taiwan-basedChannel International's recently announced takeover of Wyse Technology willbecome more prevalent in 1990, said David Readerman, vice president of equityresearch at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., a New York brokerage.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
