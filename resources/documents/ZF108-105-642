 Security must guard against both malicious humaninterference and possible disastrous loss in the form of a systemcrash.andP;  Insurance against systems failure can be had by investingin a streaming tape back-up system.andP;  Protection against humanintervention can take the form of more rigid password protection,segregation of access on a need-to-know basis and training ofusers to protect against the introduction of viruses.andP;  Othermeasures include call-back modems, as well as restricted access todial-in and dial-out phone lines.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     SecurityLocal Area NetworksBack-Up SystemsAccess ControlsNetwork Management.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Assessing SecurityandM;Hiring a security consultant before you need to rescue your data from a viruscan be far less costly than hiring that consultant after the virus has doneits dirty work.andP;  And, if you call the right specialist, you may hear somethings about security that will surprise you.andP;  For example, the consultantmight tell you that 75 percent of the protection you need is administrative,not technical.andP;  You may also find out that a reasonable investment in astreaming tape backup system could avoid serious loss.andP;  The most importantquestion the consulant will ask you is:  Why do you think you need moresecurity on your system?andM;Exposure AssessmentandM;Security frequently is compared to locking a door in your house.andP;  Certainlythat is an apt comparison in some cases.andP;  However, I lived in a small town inMichigan for years and never locked my house.andP;  I can't recall a robbery inthat rural community during the time I lived there.andP;  But when I moved to theDetroit area, it was a far different story.andP;  Everything gets locked.andP;  Twice.andM;The level of security I needed was based on risk and exposure.andP;  In the smallmidwestern town, my risk was not great.andP;  Everyone knew everyone and crime wasnot an issue.andP;  The risk went up when I moved to Detroit.andP;  In the smallcommunity, my exposure was limited; I had one computer and it wasn't worththe trouble to steal.andP;  Also, I lived in an apartment.andP;  A burglar would havehad to break into my home by passing several other apartments, some of whichhad snoopy neighbors watching every move in the area.andP;  By the time I moved toa house in the city, I had a lot more equipment to lose and fewer neighborsto keep watch.andP;  So I was not only at greater risk, I was more exposed.andM;Security begins with an honest assessment of what you can afford to lose andhow likely you are to lose it.andP;  Let's start with what you can afford to lose.andO;Government agencies have estimated that it can cost $ 2,000 per MB of lostdata to replace data after an intrusion or accident (accidents cost users alot more data than intruders do).andP;  But if your data is trivial and wellbacked up, is it really necessary to go to great expense to protect it?andP;  Dataloss could be limited to one work day if you back up properly.andM;Furthermore, if data resides on a LAN of fewer than 20 workstations with noconnection to the outside world, how great is your exposure?andP;  The truth isthat your risk and exposure are likely to be greater due to careless usersthan determined crackers.andM;The first question to ask yourself when assessing your risk is:  At whatpoint is it more expensive to reenter lost data than it is to prevent theloss?andP;  If you can recreate a week's worth of data entry in a half hour, itprobably doesn't make a lot of sense to spend thousands of dollars onsophisticated security and backup equipment.andP;  But if you have very heavy dataentry, loss of a half day's input could be disastrous.andP;  Almost any reasonablecost to prevent loss would be justified.andM;How about exposure?andP;  The box lists questions to help you determine howexposed your data is to loss.andP;  Other exposure factors not listed might bepeculiar to your installation.andP;  Physical office layout can have a big impact.andO;Not only does do intruders play a part in exposure, but also the cleaningcrew--it could hit the server power cord with a vacuum cleaner and crash yourLAN while the night crew is entering data.andM;If you get the idea that a big part of risk and exposure assessment is acombination of common sense and heading Murphy off at the pass, you're veryclose to the target.andP;  It's a fact of life that more data is lost and damagedthrough carelessness than through planned intrusion.andM;LAN Babysitting 101andM;As the network supervisor, you have 100 percent of the responsibility forkeeping your data secure.andP;  Once you formulate a realistic assessment of yourrisk and exposure, you need to put together a security plan.andP;  Remember that apart of any risk and exposure assessment is political.andP;  The issue may be lesswhat you feel your company can afford to lose and more what your boss feelsthe company can lose.andP;  Management never wants to lose any data.andP;  You know youcan afford a certain level of loss before it begins to make sense to spendmoney to prevent it.andP;  Err on the side of conservatism.andM;While you may be correct in your assessment of normal conditions, conditionsare rarely normal.andP;  Workers get sick, power goes funny, equipment fails, allat the time when you have to replace lost data.andP;  Give yourself a bit of slackas you plan for security.andP;  It's a law of nature that you'll need it.andM;When you've built your security plan, write it down.andP;  Every network with morethan 10 users should have a written security manual.andP;  Two reasons are behindthis necessary step.andP;  First, with a security manual, you do away with anyquestions about how the network is to be run and how to recover from adisaster.andP;  Second, creating such a manual is a step toward taking networkadministration more seriously.andP;  Because most data loss is accidental, itfollows that accidents can be mitigated, if not prevented, when users have ahealthy attitude toward LAN security.andM;Now the hard part starts:  enforcement.andP;  That's a very strong word for asimple, nonthreatening concept that boils down to positive attitudereenforcement.andP;  The network administrator is, in most cases, a babysitter.andO;He or she spends a lot of time teaching, hand-holding, and inconspicuouslywatching network users.andP;  Developing positive attitudes about safe computingis one of the most important parts of the LAN supervisor's job.andP;  When theadministrator fails to do that part of the job well, the rest of the job isfar more difficult.andM;After Groundwork, ActionandM;Now that we've set the stage, let's address the threats, risks, and exposureswith guidelines to keep your network safe.andP;  A rule of thumb is never riskmore than you can afford to lose.andP;  Now we'll return to our exposure list andanswer some of those questions the way you should be able to if your LAN issecure.andP;  By secure I mean within the context of your level of acceptable riskand exposure.andP;  There are no (or, at least, very few) absolutes when it comesto answering the questions.andM;How well trained are your users?andM;Training is key to good network administration and safe computing.andP;  Anunbelievable amount of data is lost or corrupted because inexperienced usersmade errors that could have been prevented by training.andP;  Often preventioncomes from simply knowing what they can and can't do on the network.andP;  Everynew user should read the company security manual.andP;  The manual should bereread periodically as a refresher.andM;Often the ability to avoid data loss starts witht he recognitiont hatsomething has gone wrong.andP;  Users are your best observers of networkperformance.andP;  They need to be trained so that they can be network assets, notliabilities.andM;&quot;Magic key&quot; sequences should be avoided unless a solid menu system is inplace on your LAN.andP;  Users should understand their computing environment, notjust thekeystrokes to do a job.andM;How many users do you have?andM;The larger the network, the greater the exposure.andP;  When LANs grow larger, itis a good idea to have workgroup administrators.andP;  With many users, you needgreater security and more stringent controls on how the network is used.andM;Is your data organized on a need-to-know basis?andM;This may be the most important question affecting exposure.andP;  The bestsecurity against common accidents and errors is to keep users out of datathey have no reason to use.andP;  This is a two-level task.andP;  First, it applies todata segregation based on the employee's right to the information.andP;  Second,it implies that novices should be limited to the areas in which they arethoroughly trained.andM;The importance of keeping users restricted to the data they both need andknow how to use can't be overemphasized.andP;  Management consultants evaluatingnetwork administration often find large amounts of data opened to corruptionby naive users who have no need to get anywhere near that information.andP;  Also,when data and programs are available to all users on a large network,deliberate damage by a disgruntled employee becomes greater.andM;Do you interconnect with other networks?andM;From a technical standpoint, this has the greatest potential for introducingdamage from intentional or unintentional virus attack.andP;  The big difficulty isthat usually there's no way of tracking down a virus or knowing that it'sbeing introduced until it's too late.andP;  If you interconnect with othernetworks automatically (polling schemes and the like), you need to be carefulof where executable programs go when they're introduced into the system.andP;  Andyou need to keep a detailed audit trail of all internetwork connections.andO;Know to whom you've connecting, when you connected, and what happened duringthe connection.andM;Also, executable files (not data) must be isolated after they are transferredto your network until you can check them for contamination or damage.andP;  Adamaged program can unpredictably hang your network.andP;  File transfers ofarchived files can often produce unpredictable results when you want tounpack the file.andM;How high is user turnover?andM;When user turnover is high, additional levels of isolation for those users insensitive areas is a must.andP;  This is one of those rare situations that demandsperiodic password changes.andM;I have some strong opinions about password changes, by the way.andP;  Conventionalwisdom says that passwords should never be shared and should be changedfrequently, often by the system itself.andP;  I don't completely agree withconventional wisdom:  Humans react negatively to frequent password changes.andO;People tend to move their data to the hard disk (if they have one) on theirown PCs to avoid using the LAN if security gets in the way of utility.andP;  This,of course, is what you don't want to happen.andM;So if you have a high-user turnover, isolate workgroups on the LAN.andO;Virtually all network operating systems allow the formation of groups.andP;  Forsensitive groups assign a two-level password scheme.andP;  The first level is forthe group.andP;  The second is for individuals.andP;  Change the group passwordwhenever you suspect a compromise or have a turnover in the group.andP;  Let theusers change their passwords when they wish.andP;  Keep the group passwordssimple.andP;  Discourage putting user passwords on boot disks, but allow the grouppassword to be automated if you feel that you have adequate security of theboot disks.andM;Do you have dial-in or dial-out phone lines?andM;This is a variation on internetworking and carries the same warnings, withone exception.andP;  If dial-out lines are accessible universally, you stand aserious risk of abuse.andP;  If every user can easily dial out on a modem, therewill be a tendency to connect to Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) and othertime-wasting, potentially dangerous sources of data and files.andP;  You do notwant uncontrolled downloads of files from BBSs, which are a primary source ofvirus infection.andP;  Also, many BBS systems are toll calls.andM;What's the solution when you have a legitimate need for dial out?andP;  Start byusing a communications server.andP;  A communications server is a separate machineon the LAN that allows network users to connect to the outside world throughone modem.andP;  To make this more attractive, you might consider a combinationfacsimile and modem board; you have the advantage of making both dial out andfax available to all network users.andM;But here's the catch.andP;  Since the communications server's use can berestricted, you can do two things.andP;  First, you can restrict who uses it andwhen.andP;  Second, you can keep a detailed log of all communications serveractivity.andP;  With these two controls, those who need outside connection canhave it, under your scrutiny, and you will know what they did use an outsideconnection and when.andM;Are dial-out lines accessible to all users?andM;Following up on the preceding question, the answer to this one is usually no.andO;All users rarely need outside connections.andP;  When they do, however, use thecommunications server approach and write scripts that automate (and restrict)the outside numbers to which users can connect.andM;Do you have a procedure for screening new software before it is placed intoservice on your LAN?andM;Never allow a new program, regardless of where it came from, on your networkuntil you have screend it.andP;  Screening has several levels.andP;  For a commercialprogram delivered from a legitimate supplier in its shrinkwrap, screening mayconsist of checking the package for damage and installing it.andP;  For a utilitybrought in by an employee, screening may include a virus scan on an isolatedPC.andM;Never load an executable program that isn't delivered directly from acommercial supplier.andP;  Don't allow disk swapping; it's piracy, illegal, anddangerous.andP;  Discourage personal programs on your LAN, but if you do allow it,screen them for damage or viruses.andP;  Do your screening on an offline, isolated(standalone) PC.andP;  Include such procedures as scanning with antivirusprograms, moving the system date forward to dates such as April 1, Friday the13th, or Columbus Day, and checking files on the isolated machine for changesin length.andM;How many network administrators do you have?andM;On large LANs, you may need multiple network administrators.andP;  Networkadministrators can have a lot of power.andP;  And, if they are disgruntled, theycan do a lot of damage.andP;  If you must use several administrators, grantprivileges selectively; that is, avoid global privileges for all but the mainnetwork administrator.andP;  Give local administrators the privileges they needwithin their work or responsibility areas.andP;  Stick to the need-to-know rulewith administrators and users and you won't go wrong.andM;How do your users boot their machines?andM;There are many ways to boot machines on a LAN.andP;  Putting the boot files on thehard disk is convenient, but it's also a good way to invite unauthorized use.andO;So, unless your LAN is very small, don't give in to temptation.andP;  Use floppyboot disks and keep them secure when not in use.andP;  How secure goes back to therisk and exposure assessment discussed earlier.andM;What hardware comprises a typical workstation?andM;The ideal workstation, for security and utility, is the diskless workstation.andO;They can't be force-booted by an inside hacker, they tend to have moreuseable application memory, and they are usually nice, easy-to-use colormonitors.andP;  They also cost more than many PCs and most networks grow out of acollection of single-user computers, which are converted for LAN use.andM;How can you have your cake and eat it too?andP;  If you determine that you are atrisk and highhly exposed, make it a rule to replace old, dying PCs withdiskless workstations.andP;  When you need a new workstation, make it diskless.andO;If that's overkill for your situation, limit workstations with hard drives tothose users who absolutely must be offline from time to time, or to serverusers on a peer-to-peer LAN with nondedicated servers.andM;What is the typical state of user morale?andM;Low morale demands high security.andP;  After accidents, the most common source ofdamaged, compromised, or lost data is the disgruntled employee.andP;  These folksare very dangerous because they are, in security terms, trusted users.andP;  Theyalso are often hard to ferret out since they rarely signal their intentionsto intrude company data.andP;  They also know how to use the LAN.andM;What applications do you run?andM;Database applications are the most vulnerable to intrusion.andP;  They are alsothe most likely to sustain severe loss if compromised.andP;  However, industrialstrength databases often have audit trails and individual passwords.andP;  Makeconstant use of audit trails, and use nested passwords in accordance withyour risk and exposure assessment.andP;  Remember, people won't use applicationsthat are too confusing or time consuming to access.andP;  So use balance toprotect your data without discouraging authorized access.andM;Do you connect to mainframes or minicomputers?andM;This is similar to the dial-out line problem, but not as tough to handle.andO;These connections are, usually, dedicated and controlled at the mainframeend.andP;  A good bet, though, is to include the connections on the communicationsserver described earlier.andP;  If you confine all outside communications to acommunications server or appropriate bridge, you'll control access withoutgetting in the user's way.andM;What is your backup procedure?andM;Volumes could be written on how to back up your LAN.andP;  But it all boils downto two pieces of advice: do it and use a grandfather system.andP;  You should backup as frequently as your situation demands.andP;  That could be several times aday in extreme cases, but it should be at least daily.andM;By grandfathering, you use a schedule that insures that you won't loseimportant data, even if you are hit by a virus.andP;  First, make a baselinebackup so every file on the LAN is backed up.andP;  It is the basis you'll use ifyou must restore the entire system.andP;  Second, make daily backups, which youkeep until the end of the week.andP;  At week's end, you do the weekly back up,which you keep for a month.andP;  Return the daily tapes to use for next week'sbackups.andM;Now, each month, do a monthly backup, which you keep for a year.andP;  Thus, youhave four dailies.andP;  On Friday, you keep a weekly.andP;  At the end of the month,you have four weeklies.andP;  At the end of the year, you have 12 monthlies.andP;  Andyou always have the baseline backup.andP;  Only back up files that chance(incremental backup).andP;  Then when you need to restore an entire drive, youstart with the baseline and then update with the most recent incrementalbackup.andP;  If you find a virus in your backup, you can move to an earlierbackup (that's why you grandfather) and the worst you'll have to do isreenter a month's worth of data.andM;Do you have a disaster recovery plan?andM;It's a subject in itself, but the bottom line is, you'd better.andP;  If you don'thave a plan, you'll lose data.andP;  It's not if, it's when.andM;How do your users view network security?andM;This is a tough one.andP;  If you use too much security, your users may avoid it.andO;You don't want that.andP;  Part of the reason for a LAN is that you can controlthe data your company uses to keep it pure and up-to-date.andM;The solution is to use as much security as your risk and exposure assessmentdemands.andP;  Educate your users about the level of security you deemappropriate.andP;  Keep education positive and upbeat and, if possible, don'tprovide a place for your users to offload data and avoid LAN use altogether.andM;How complicated is your current security scheme?andM;Continuing in the same vein, the least complicated security is usedconsistently.andP;  But don't be tempted to automate the login process unless yourboot disks are well secured.andP;  It's never a good idea to include passwords onboot disks, though.andP;  If you must automate, leave out that one importantaspect.andP;  First, it invites intrusion.andP;  Second, it complicates later changesto passwords.andM;How clean and consistent is your power?andM;This is often overlooked.andP;  You can lose lots of data with no intrusion oruser accident if you connect to dirty power.andP;  If your risk assessmentincludes dirty power, get an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) for everyvulnerable computer.andP;  Here again, use your risk and exposure assessment todecide where you need a UPS.andM;Keeping It Your BusinessandM;The bottom line for LAN security is very simple.andP;  Decide what yourealistically need in security with your risk and exposure assessment andthen apply the security measures.andP;  Have a disaster recovery plan and awritten security document that lays down policies and procedures.andM;Infuse your users with a sense of security and responsibility for the data onyour company's LAN.andP;  Isolate users and subadministrators to the data theyneed to use.andP;  Perform regular, grandfathered incremental backups and maintaina detailed audit trail of LAN activity so that if you do have a problem youcan track it down more easily.andP;  Limit or, at least, control access to outsidesystems.andP;  If you must internetwork, be sure that you maintain audit trailrecords, again, to track down problems.andP;  Finally, screen all new softwarebefore you put it on your LAN.andM;Security is as much about preventing data loss from errors as it is aboutpreventing intrusion.andP;  And intrusion, when it occurs, is likely from someoneinside the company.andP;  You can gain a lot of additional security on your LAN ifyou use common sense and apply businesslike administrative procedures.andO;Security is meant to keep your business your business.andP;  But it's also meantto help users do their jobs safely and conveniently.andP;  If you carefullyperform risk and exposure assessment, you will have a system that can workfor your company and give you far fewer headaches.andM;Peter Stephenson is an independent consultant and author.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
