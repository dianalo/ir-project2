Several experimentshave been performed to investigate the location of critical heat flux(CHF) and the resulting post-CHF heat transfer. The experimental dataprovide necessary information to evaluate the accuracy of the predictionsof a computer code. For LOCA analysis, the central issue, of course,is the prediction of fuel rod cladding temperature. The WCOBRA/TRAC code,developed from COBRA/TRAC for analysis of nuclear reactor vessel andprimary loop two-phase transients, is being used as a best-estimate modelfor LOCA licensing calculations at Westinghouse Electric Corporation.The code employs a two-fluid three-field (liquid, vapor, and droplet)model to represent a two-phase flow, which is necessary in simulatingdispersed-flow film-boiling phenomena. Each field is treated as three-dimensionaland compressible. The conservation equations for each field and the heattransfer from and within the solid structures in contact with the fluidare solved using a semiimplicit finite difference numerical scheme inEulerian mesh structure. The noding scheme is very flexible and can beused to model complicated geometry.</TEXT></DOC>
