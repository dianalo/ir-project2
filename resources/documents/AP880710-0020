The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to worktoward a treaty that would reduce by 50 percent their combinedlong-range missiles over seven years, with each side limited to6,000 nuclear warheads.   ``A long way has already been covered toward the treaty on 50percent reductions in strategic offensive arms,'' Obukhov said.``The outstanding questions can and should be resolved.''   The Soviet negotiator called for a ``constructive approach'' byWashington.   Obukhov said the two major obstacles to the new arms agreementare the long-standing disagreement over Reagan's Strategic DefenseInitiative, known as ``Star Wars,'' and the issue of limitingsea-launched cruise missiles.   The Soviets link a new treaty to curbs on SDI, a space-basedmissile defense system. The Soviets say Reagan's program wouldviolate the 1972 U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, whichlimits each side to a missile defense at one site.   They want the United States to limit the scope of SDI, butReagan repeated at the beginning of the Moscow summit that hisprogram is not on the bargaining table.   Obukhov reiterated a call for both sides to strictly observe theABM treaty.   Obukhov called sea-launched cruise missiles a ``dangerous typeof strategic offensive arms'' and said ``reliable'' limits are aprerequisite for an effective treaty. He urged that anti-cheatingmeasures include inspections aboard warships, a proposal the UnitedStates has rejected.   Obukhov said progress at the Geneva negotiations now dependsmainly on resolving these points, which Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev failed to do at their May 29-June 2 meeting.   However, the leaders agreed at the summit that both sides shouldconsider all existing long-range air-launched cruise missiles asnuclear weapons and distinguish between bombers that carry them andthose that do not.   The two sides also agreed to restrict mobile missiles todesignated territories to simplify counting. But the size of theareas was not set.   Both types of weapons are to be included in the new treaty.   Noting the agreements at the summit, Obukhov said the resumedGeneva talks have ``a special dimension.''   Reagan and Gorbachev said after the Moscow meeting that a treatyon reducing long-range nuclear missiles is possible before Reaganleaves office in January, but no breakthrough appears imminent.   Obukhov said the length of the new round of talks in Geneva,which began in March 1985, has not been set.   He will meet chief U.S. delegate Max Kampelman on Monday todiscuss procedural details. Kampelman arrived here Saturday but didnot speak to reporters.   At a December summit meeting in Washington, Reagan and Gorbachevsigned a treaty eliminating intermediate-range missiles and bothcountries ratified the pact shortly before the Moscow summit.</TEXT></DOC>
