Not Pacific Telesis Group, which yesterday finally won approval from California regulators to start reducing certain prices to meet competition.    Wall Street analysts see a number of good omens for the company in the unanimous ruling by the state utility commission.    The ruling allows the company's Pacific Bell Telephone unit to reduce rates on Centrex services, private lines and custom-calling features, such as call forwarding. Under previous rules, Pacific Bell and other local telephone companies couldn't reduce prices or modify contract terms without commission approval.    Industry analysts figure the ruling will help San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis in two ways:   First, they expect it will protect the company's earnings from future erosion, a serious concern in the past couple of years as many big customers have taken their business elsewhere.    Second, they believe the decision portends a gradual softening of the commission's regulatory posture toward Pacific Telesis. Since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, that hard-line, consumer-minded stance has been a major source of apprehension on Wall Street about the company's long-term outlook.    &quot;The hands we were dealt didn't come out evenly,&quot; acknowledges the chairman of another regional Bell company. &quot;For example, nobody would deny that the California PUC has been a special cross for PacTel to bear.&quot;    But analysts are heartened by the prospects of a lighter regulatory burden. &quot;This is a solid first step in the relaxation of regulation,&quot; said Edward Greenberg, a telecommunications analyst for Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    Adds Robert Morris, who follows the industry for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., &quot;California is booming, and its business environment is getting more competitive. The commission has recognized that the company does need to be able to respond.&quot;    News of the commission's decision didn't reach the East Coast until late in the day. Pacific Telesis shares closed unchanged at 30.    Pacific Bell's inability to lower its prices has hurt a lot. Sam L. Ginn, chairman of Pacific Telesis, estimates the unit has lost 11 of its 20 largest Centrex business customers over the past three years to such rivals as International Business Machines, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph and MCI Communications.    In 1986 alone, Pacific Bell claims it lost 62 of 70 bids for business-telephone switching services because it couldn't adjust terms or prices.    In a recent interview, Pacific Telesis's Mr. Ginn said, &quot;What we told the commissioners was: 'We've already lost half of our largest business customers. Don't wait until we lose them all to decide.'&quot;    The commission didn't wait forever, but its process was deliberate. Details of the agreement were hammered out during informal workshops that began in March. About 30 groups participated, including ratepayer advocates and business and government customers.    That workshop-like approach may be followed again; the commission said its decision concludes only the first phase of a broader examination of regulatory alternatives. Among the next topics: whether to switch to price caps (from the sometimes more restrictive profit caps) and to other forms of incentive-building regulation.    While analysts view the decision as a harbinger of further change, they don't predict abrupt relaxation of rules. &quot;I don't think they will throw the door wide open,&quot; says Goldman's Mr. Morris. He isn't boosting his earnings forecast for the company; he still expects Pacific Telesis to earn about $2.85 a share this year and about $3.05 a share in 1989. Last year, the company earned $950 million, or $2.21 a share, on revenue of $9.13 billion.    Lap Lee, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, is somewhat more optimistic. &quot;This is far from over,&quot; he says. He predicts some actions by the commission in early 1989 that will give Pacific Telesis &quot;incentives to be more efficient.&quot; As a result, he sees the company earning about $3.25 a share next year.    Such a stance would constitute a major shift by the agency. A few years ago, when Pacific Bell submitted a request to increase rates, the commission responded instead with an extensive audit that resulted in fat refunds and rate reductions.    ---   Pacific Telesis   (NYSE; Symbol: PAC)   Business: Telecommunications   Year ended Dec. 31, 1987:   Revenue: $9.13 billion   Net income: $950 million; $2.21 a share -   Second quarter, June 30, 1988:   Per-share earnings: 76 cents vs. 61 cents*   Average daily trading volume:   522,463 shares   Common shares outstanding: 427.1 million   *1987 figures restated</TEXT></DOC>
