The surge in the sales, which exclude stores open for less than a year, helped boost the company's stock up $2.375, to close at $31.50 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.    Despite the success of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, analysts said that many toy retailers and manufacturers had a sluggish season. Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, they said, probably gained more market share than in prior years because it stocked the types of toys that were most popular with shoppers.    Paul Valentine, an analyst at Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., estimated that the toy industry grew between 2% and 4% for the year, with a Christmas-season increase of between 7% and 8%.    During the eight-week season, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us said, the company's overall sales, including new stores, rose 26.8% to $1.05 billion compared with $826 million last year. Sales for the 11 months ended Dec. 28 increased 23.2% to $2.31 billion from $1.88 billion for the same period last year.    On a comparable-store basis, the company's U.S. toy store sales rose 12% for the Christmas season and 7.9% for the 11 months. The company said business was strong throughout the U.S. except for some weakness in the Texas and Oklahoma areas.    &quot;We look forward to another record year in 1987,&quot; the company said.    The company said it also had strong sales at its Kids &quot;R&quot; Us clothing stores and plans to open at least 25 more this year, many in the Midwest.    Toys &quot;R&quot; Us operates 271 toy stores in the United States, 24 international toy stores, 43 Kids &quot;R&quot; Us children's clothing stores and four department stores. </TEXT></DOC>
