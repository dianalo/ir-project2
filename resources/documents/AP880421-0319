We can be No.1 again.''   The final tally, 312-107, contradicted numerous forecasts thatthe bill's sponsors would fail to produce the two-thirds voteneeded to override a veto.   But many lawmakers, even if they had their doubts, appeared tohave no taste in an election year for going on record against ameasure billed as a plan to upgrade American competitiveness.   The bill was a House-Senate compromise on two competing measuresthat passed both chambers last year. The measure now goes to theSenate, where Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., planned tobegin debate Friday. He was shooting for a vote on final passageearly next week.   The House passed the measure after defeating, 253-167, a move byMinority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., to throw the bill back tothe conference committee and drop the plant-closings provision.   Reagan, on the road in Massachusetts, said he would veto thebill if it came to him with the plant-closings provision intact. Healso sent a letter to Michel, saying, ``I want a trade bill.''   ``I will work vigorously to secure one,'' Reagan said. ``And Iwill urge the leadership to schedule prompt action on a billimmediately after the Congress sustains my forthcoming veto'' ofthe current trade bill.   Controversy over the plant-closings provision overshadowedcentral features of the bill, which would streamline the way theUnited States imposes import curbs to aid U.S. industries andretaliate against international trade violations.   Scores of other provisions ranged from repeal of the windfallprofits tax to billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies.   Dueling over plant closings provision went on almost to the lastminute.   ``I am more interested in plant openings than plant closings,''said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas.   However, Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., said it would be amistake to allow such an important measure to become hung up on oneprovision. ``It is so modest, so watered down, so full ofexceptions'' that it probably will not have as much effect aslawmakers intended, he said.   Debate focused heavily on the provision that would require allbut the smallest employers to give 60-day notice of upcoming plantclosings and large-scale layoffs. The measure contains a number ofexceptions for companies that sudenly find themselves in anemergency.   The centerpiece provisions would streamline the system underwhich the United States imposes import curbs and other means to aidindustries threatened by foreign competition and retaliate againstinternational trade violatrions.   Scores of other provisions range from repeal of the windfallprofits tax on oil companies to billions of dollars in newagricultural subsidies.   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,D-Ill., said the bill for the first time ``establishes a policythat will make America a winner in international competitivemarkets.''   But Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., whose amendment to rollback Japanese trade surpluses was dropped earlier, said the measuredid not go far enough in forcing open foreign markets.   Rep. Edward R. Madigan, R-Ill., said that with the ink barelydry he had discovered that the 1,000-page bill would increase theamount of Caribbean ethanol allowed in duty-free.   ``I thought we were going to try to create jobs, I thought wewere going to create markets,'' Madigan said. ``But here we aretrying to give away some of our own jobs and give away some of ourown markets, just exactly the oppsosite of what we said we weretrying to do.''   But Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., said ``This bill will put pressureon our trading competitors to open up their markets and play fairlyand squarely with the trading system that we already have.''   Republican critics of the plant-closings provision citedbusiness fears that plant-closings notice would reduce credit,frighten customers, cut productivity and perhaps lead to sabotageamong disappointed employees facing layoffs. They also said it hadno direct connection with the trade issue.</TEXT></DOC>
