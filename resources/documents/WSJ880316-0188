INDUSTRIALI RIUNITE, or CIR, said it has received &quot;several offers for activities of the BUITONI S.P.A group.&quot;    The pasta maker Buitoni and its Perugina S.p.A chocolates unit have been at the center of speculation in recent weeks on the Milan stock exchange, where Buitoni shares have been soaring on rumors of a possible sale. But the wording of CIR's statement appears to indicate that only part of Buitoni is involved in the bids.    Yesterday, Buitoni shares closed at 10,005 lire ($8.13), up 6.4% from 9,399 lire Monday. Perugina shares jumped 2.8%, to 4,800 lire from 4,670 lire.    A CIR spokeswoman declined to comment on who had made the Buitoni offers or whether a sale was planned, but market sources have persistently named Nestle S.A. of Switzerland, which recently allied itself with CIR Chairman Carlo De Benedetti in his bid for Societe Generale de Belgique S.A., as a possible acquirer. A spokesman for Nestle said, &quot;We don't comment on rumors.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
