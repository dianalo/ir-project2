The administration's Trade Policy Review Group and the cabinet-level Economic Policy Council have urged the imposition of sanctions. Short of an unexpected last-minute Brazilian concession, Mr. Reagan will have to start the process of determining penalties against Brazil on or before Friday's deadline for his administration to complete an investigation of alleged trade infractions, the officials said.    If Mr. Reagan acts as expected, it would be the second time this year Washington threatened to impose punitive tariffs on a range of Brazilian exports to the U.S. Earlier this year Brazil averted sanctions by responding to a U.S. complaint about its software import policies.    The latest dispute arises from Brazil's refusal to rescind a 1971 industrial-property code that declares pharmaceutical products and the processes for manufacturing them to be &quot;nonpatentable inventions.&quot;    The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a Washington-based trade body on whose behalf the administration is acting, charges that Brazilian infringements of its members' patent rights have cost them a total of $100 million to $150 million annually in lost export sales, unrecovered research costs and reduced profit margins.    The U.S. won't impose penalties until after it holds hearings to determine the appropriate level. The association wants sanctions equivalent to the injury to its members. But the association reports that the administration favors limiting any penalties initially to $36 million a year in Brazilian shipments. &quot;The administration could expand these penalties, though, if we don't get any {satisfactory} action from Brazil,&quot; said Jay Kingham, the PMA's senior vice president for international affairs.    The expected action against Brazil is part of the Reagan administration's efforts to prod the Third World into accepting a strict intellectual-property code. Brazil is the focus of this campaign because it is leading a movement among developing nations to soften a code being drafted by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based body that regulates global trade.    Time is running out for an early solution to the pharmaceuticals dispute. U.S. officials said Brazil privately offered to restore protection for drug-manufacturing processes through administrative measures. However, the U.S. association rejected the offer. &quot;We want protection for products as well,&quot; the association's Mr. Kingham said.    If Mr. Reagan opts for sanctions, it would take his aides several weeks to determine their value and the Brazilian commodities to be affected. This process would be &quot;flexible,&quot; a U.S. official said. &quot;Brazil can come in at any time, and we'd be prepared to listen.&quot;    Eighteen of the association members, including Pfizer Inc., Merck andamp; Co. and Eli Lilly andamp; Co., operate in Brazil, with combined revenues there of $600 million a year. A number of European manufacturers with investments in Brazil, including Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co., Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Sandoz Ltd., also stand to benefit from any Brazilian move to restore patent rights.    But a Brazilian official suggested that his country may continue to allow Brazilian companies to infringe on foreign patents. &quot;Foreign capital already controls a large part of our pharmaceutical market, so it's difficult to call this law protectionism,&quot; argued Pedro Rodriguez, a spokesman for the Brazilian embassy. If Brazil gives it up, that would be tantamount to &quot;denationalizing our whole industry,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
