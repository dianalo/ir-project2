(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Teamsters Joint Council 73, weary ofwisecracks about former union president Jimmy Hoffa, has passed aresolution condemning politicians who make jokes about hisdisappearance.   The resolution was adopted unanimously Monday by the JointCouncil's legislative conference in Atlantic City. The councilrepresents most union locals in New York and New Jersey, with atotal of about 100,000 members.   In an interview in the November issue of Playboy magazine, aself-professed hitman claims Hoffa's body was buried near the westend zone of Giants Stadium in East Rutherford.   Gov. Thomas Kean, seeking to boost fellow Republican JamesCourter's bid to replace him, invoked Hoffa's name in taking a jabat the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Rep. James Florio.   ``Trying to find out where Jim Florio stands is like trying tofind out where Jimmy Hoffa is buried _ and it's not under GiantsStadium,'' Kean said last week in addressing a GOP fundraiser thatwas attended by President Bush.   Anthony Rizzo, business manager of Teamsters Local 945 in Wayne,introduced the measure.   ``If you don't have any respect for the man, then think at least deadlineat hand, the UnitedStates and Egypt are exerting heavy pressure on Israel to go alongwith a proposal for preliminary peace talks with Palestinianrepresentatives.   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak sounded upbeat Monday aboutprospects for a peace settlement, saying a ``golden opportunity''exists that must not be squandered.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has been campaigninghard for a more flexible Israeli position on the issue, said Israelshould not feel threatened by the 10-point proposal for peace talksset forth by Mubarak.   The inner cabinet of ministers from Likud and Labor is to meetThursday on Mubarak's ideas amid deep divisions on how to proceed.   Likud rejects Mubarak's acceptance of a U.S.-backed formula thatinvolves trading occupied land for peace and including peopledeported by Israel in a Palestinian negotiating delegation. Labor,led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, supports both ideas.   Meanwhile, President Bush called Israeli Prime Minister YitzhakShamir on Monday and told him ``a dialogue was necessary'' betweenIsrael and the Palestinians, presidential press secretary MarlinFitzwater disclosed today.   Fitzwater said that Bush spoke with the Israeli leader for``just a few minutes'' in advance of Monday's White House meetingwith Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.   ``The discussion was very general,'' Fitzwater said, saying Bushcontacted Shamir mainly as a courtesy.   ``He emphasized our interest in the peace process...that heobviously felt a dialogue was necessary,'' Fitzwater said.   Mubarak told reporters the essential next step in the peaceprocess is to persuade the Israelis and the Palestinians to enter adialogue ``without preconditions.''   ``We won't get to peace until Palestinians and Israelis speak toeach other,'' Baker said.   Baker regards the Egyptian plan as a complement to _ not asubstitute for _ Shamir's proposal for elections in whichPalestinians would select representatives to negotiate with Israelon limited self-government in the occupied territories.   Monday's White House session came amid new concern that settlingJewish immigrants from the Soviet Union in the Israeli-occupiedWest Bank could threaten peace efforts.   Bush administration officials reacted coolly to an Israelirequest for $400 million in housing loan guarantees for about100,000 Jewish emigres from the Soviet Union. Israeli officialshave said some dwellings probably will be in the West Bank.   ``The United States policy is to oppose additional settlementsin the occupied territories,'' Baker said.   Baker also said U.S. ability to assist Israel is limited by``severe budgetary constraints.''</TEXT></DOC>
