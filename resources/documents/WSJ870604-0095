In the year-earlier quarter, the company had a $1.3 million loss on revenue of $1.6 million.    The biotechnology company said EBC Amro Bank Ltd., a London-based investment bank unit of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank N.V., has acquired a majority interest in its Dutch agricultural research unit, Mogen International B.V., in a series of transactions with Molecular Genetics, MIP Equity Fund and Mogen. As a result, Molecular Genetics' 92% stake in Mogen is reduced to 11%.    The company said the reduction of its stake in Mogen will allow the company to focus on its primary businesses. Molecular Genetics added that a technology-transfer agreement between it and Mogen remains in effect.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Molecular Genetics closed at $7.50 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
