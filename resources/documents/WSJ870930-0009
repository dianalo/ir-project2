A heavy slate of federal, state and local government borrowing was partly responsible for the bond market slump, traders said. The debacle came despite a sharp rise in the dollar against most major currencies.    Prices of actively traded 30-year government securities tumbled about 1 1/4 points, or $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Yields, which rise as prices fall, now exceed 9 3/4% on the latest such issue.    Prices of corporate and municipal bonds also plummeted as underwriters and securities dealers with large bond inventories struggled to find buyers for many new issues.    &quot;If I knew I was going to die in a market like this, I'd jump out the window,&quot; said Frank Scaraggi, an executive vice president in charge of municipal bond trading and sales at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;Everybody's selling. We saw banks, mutual funds, individuals all dumping portfolios. It just snowballed.&quot;    The bond market's grim conditions prompted some borrowers and their underwriters to postpone new offerings. Early in the morning yesterday &quot;things were calm,&quot; said Richard E. Kolman, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;By 9 a.m., bond prices were going straight down.&quot; As a result, he said, the pricing of a $204 million issue of Housing New York Corp. revenue bonds was aborted. &quot;It didn't make sense to issue in an unstable market,&quot; he said.    The more than $30 billion of U.S. Treasury securities to be auctioned this week weighed heavily on the credit markets. &quot;We're charged with distributing all this debt and we can't find any place to go with the supply,&quot; said Daniel J. Callahan Jr., manager of the government bond department at First Boston Corp. &quot;We didn't see any demand&quot; from institutional investors yesterday at the Treasury's sale of $9.26 billion of two-year notes.    The average annual yield on the notes was 8.57%, well above what many dealers expected. At the close Monday afternoon, Mr. Callahan said many dealers expected an average yield of just under 8.5%.    The Treasury auction yesterday was the first part of a $23.25 billion financing operation. The 8.57% yield was up from 7.86% at the previous sale of two-year notes Aug. 26 and was the highest since an average of 8.58% on two-year notes sold Nov. 20, 1985.    The Treasury said it received bids totaling $24.38 billion. That was down sharply from $31.41 billion at the August sale, when $9.81 billion of notes were auctioned.    Adding to the markets' already considerable woes was another increase in the closely watched federal funds rate. The funds rate, which is the rate on overnight loans of reserves between banks, often strongly influences many other rates, including those that dealers pay to finance their holdings.    Moreover, the higher funds rate has aroused speculation among some traders that the Federal Reserve may be engineering another round of increases in short-term interest rates. The funds rate surged to an average of nearly 8% yesterday from 7.48% Monday and 7 1/4% in the week ended last Wednesday.    Nevertheless, several economists argued that the increase in the funds rate merely reflected technical factors, rather than any Fed policy change, and that the rate soon will drift lower.    &quot;I think the higher funds rate was purely technical,&quot; said Robert H. Ried, president of Ried Thunberg andamp; Co., a Westport, Conn., investment research firm. He and several other analysts noted that the funds rate often rises at the end of a quarter without changes in Fed policy.    The bond market sell-off despite a stronger dollar surprised many traders and analysts. &quot;It was confusing,&quot; said Mr. Ried.    Several analysts attributed part of yesterday's slump to selling by money managers in order to show a reduced level of bond holdings in their end-of-quarter reports, especially in view of widespread expectations for further rises in interest rates. &quot;Quarter-end selling pressures&quot; probably played an important role in yesterday's rout, said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. Some money managers &quot;probably felt it would be embarrassing to show a lot of bonds in their quarterly statements.&quot;    The decline in bond prices and rise in short-term interest rates yesterday created havoc for underwriters of new issues. &quot;It's definitely been a struggle,&quot; said Mr. Scaraggi of Shearson Lehman. Shearson headed a group of underwriters that submitted the winning bid to arrange a $100 million issue of Illinois general obligation bonds due 1988-2012. The underwriters could only sell about $40 million of the offering yesterday, Mr. Scaraggi said.    The IIlinois bonds were priced after auction to yield from 5.2% in 1988 to 8.35% in 2010-2012. The issue is rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-plus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    A $140 million issue of Chicago Public Building Commission revenue bonds due 1989, 1997-2005 and 2007 also received a lukewarm reception from investors despite having the highest yield for an insured offering this year. &quot;There are very few investors buying bonds,&quot; said Andrew Rowley, a principal at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., which arranged the Chicago issue. Yields on the offering, which is rated triple-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P, ranged from 6% in 1989 to 8.55% in 2007. The bonds are insured by Bond Investors Guaranty.    Elsewhere in the municipal new issue market, underwriters led by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. had better sales results managing a $152 million offering of Pennsylvania general obligation bonds due 1988-2007. The bonds were priced after auction to yield from 5.4% in 1988 to 8.2% in 2007. J.P. Morgan said $60.2 million remained unsold. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's and double-A-minus by Sandamp;P.    Some economists say the credit markets were partly buffeted by a sharp sell-off in the Japanese government bond market. The yield on the Japanese government's benchmark 10-year bond, for example, surged yesterday to 6.07%, its highest level this year, from 5.86% at the start of trading.    &quot;That isn't an unusual swing for the Tokyo market,&quot; said David Resler, a senior vice president at Nomura Securities International. &quot;But it confirmed the perception among investors that stronger economic growth around the world is leading to higher interest rates. The bond markets are overcome with fear about where rates are headed and who's going to buy a lot of Treasury securities for sale,&quot; he added.    In the corporate new-issue market, two related concerns that plan to sell debt securities to help finance the takeover of Taft Broadcasting had $510 million of these securities priced. FMI Financial Corp.'s $260 million of senior subordinated debntures due October 1999 were priced at par to yield 14.375%. The issue is rated triple-C-plus by Sandamp;P. GACC Holding Corp.'s $125 million of senior extendible notes, with a final maturity of October 1995, were priced at par to yield 13 1/4%. The coupon is reset by the company in 1990.    Another GACC $125 million issue of senior notes due October 1996 was priced at par to yield 14.125%. The issues are being sold through underwriters at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.    Separately, a $265 million issue of Caesars World Inc. subordinated debentures due October 1997 were priced at par to yield 13 1/2% by Drexel Burnham Lambert. The issue is rated single-B-1 by Moody's and double-B-minus by Sandamp;P.    In the credit markets yesterday, Shearson Lehman's index of long-term Treasury bonds fell about 13.5 points to 1165.15. That was its lowest closing level since Dec. 2, 1985. The index yesterday ranged between 1181.94 and 1164.05.    The latest 30-year Treasury issue, the 8 7/8% bonds due 2017, fell to a price of 90 30/32 from 92 8/32 Monday. The yield rose to 9.82% from 9.67%. That was the highest since Dec. 6, 1985, when a similar benchmark 30-year issue yielded 9.86%, according to Shearson Lehman.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 slumped to 93 14/32 from 94 14/32 Monday. The yield rose to 9.66% from 9.5%.    Rates also rose on short-term Treasury bills. The latest 13-week Treasury bill rate climbed to 6.65% bid from an average rate of 6.59% set at Monday's auction. The latest 26-week bill rate climbed to 6.91% bid from Monday's auction average of 6.83%.    The Treasury today is scheduled to sell about $9.25 billion of one-year bills. The bills were quoted in when-issued trading late yesterday at about 7 3/8%.    Here are details of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
