While not announcing a policy reversal, Kemp told a Housesubcommittee that the Department of Housing and Urban Developmentwas looking ``for some way to take the best characteristics of theSection 8 certificate and the voucher and marry them.''   ``I don't want to be the secretary of vouchers. I really,strongly believe we need housing and economic development andvouchers are a tool to give people a choice,'' said Kemp.   Kemp's comments came in an apppearance before the HouseAppropriations Subcommittee on HUD and independent agencies wherehe presented the agency's 1990 budget request a day after the fullcommittee voted to add $153 million under the McKinney HomelessAssistance Act to the agency's 1989 budget. department's 1990budget request.   Replacement of certificates with vouchers originated with formerPresident Reagan's 1990 budget proposal and was retained in therevisions Bush submitted to Congress in February.   About 1 million low-income households receive rental assistancesubsidies through the two programs.   Subsidies in the HUD section 8 certificate are based on thedifference between 30 percent of a family's adjusted monthly incomeand actual rent, which cannot exceed the fair market rent for thearea in which the family lives.   Beginning in 1989, subsidies for 780,000 certificates willexpire over a 12-year period.   A recent study by the General Accounting Office, theinvestigative arm of Congress, concluded that ``with HUD's 1989budget request, about 9,500 or 6 percent fewer families can beassisted with vouchers than with certificates.''   The report also said it would cost an additional $208 million toassist the same number of families with vouchers.   ``They are ... more expensive than the certificate, but thepurpose was not to compete against the certificate. The purpose wasto give choice, ... give people a chance to upgrade,'' Kemp toldthe panel.   But he said he was open to looking at a mix of both as a part ofHUD's housing subsidy program.   ``I'd also like to have somebody think of how we can take avoucher or a certificate and have an element in there that wouldgive people some equity, some chance of maybe using it as apotential for making a down payment someday,'' Kemp added.   ``I commend Secretary Kemp for taking a fresh look at thisissue. The recent GAO report showed that the housing voucherprogram hasn't lived up to expectations. I stand ready to work withSecretary Kemp to develop a program that will providemoderate-income pepole with the housing they need and at a price wecan afford,'' said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., chairman ofSenate's HUD Appropriations subcommittee that had requested the GAOstudy.</TEXT></DOC>
