Holdings.    Meanwhile, Bond Corp. said it has increased its stake in Bell Group to 51%, mainly through purchases on the stock market. Bond Corp. launched its bid in early June, after acquiring 19.9% of Bell Group from Mr. Holmes a Court in April at A$2.70 a share. The offer values the entire target company at more than A$860 million (US$690.4 million).    Baring Brothers Burrows andamp; Partners Ltd., an investment bank advising Bell Group, called the Bond Corp. offer &quot;fair and reasonable&quot; and said chances of a counter bid were slim. The advisers calculated Bell Group's net asset value at A$1.63 to $A2.14 a share. Bell Group's shares were unchanged in Sydney yesterday at A$2.58.    Baring Brothers also said Bell Group's 43%-owned Bell Resources Ltd. has further pared its stake in Broken Hill Proprietary Co. to 6%. Until early this year, Bell Resources controlled 30% of Broken Hill, a steel, oil and mining concern that is Australia's largest company. </TEXT></DOC>
