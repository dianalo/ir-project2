Everything remains the same. We'll continue to press for Noriega's removal&quot; and his arrest to stand trial in the United States on drug charges, Mr. Fitzwater said. Given the opportunity the coup attempt afforded and the presence of well-trained U.S. troops on the scene, it seems that a golden opportunity to press for that ouster in the most effective way was lost yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
