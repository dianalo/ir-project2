Since its birth in 1985, The Weekly Mail has been a combativegovernment opponent, winning staunch friends and making plenty ofenemies, but never losing its sense of humor.   Its aggressive reporting and sassy political commentary haveearned it the nickname ``The Weekly Wail,'' and many consider itthe best-written newspaper in South Africa.   The newspaper has a circulation of only 22,000, and most of thereaders are well-off white liberals. Its prominent backers rangefrom U.S. Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., to the Royal Dutch Shell OilCo., which places a full-page ad in each issue supporting pressfreedom or urging political reform.   ``Three years ago, we felt the tradition of aggressive, criticalnewspapers was being lost,'' said co-editor Anton Harber. ``Ourrole has been to pursue in-depth coverage of the townships andpolitics and take a more strident stance against censorship.''   The government repeatedly has attacked The Weekly Mail as partof the ``alternative media'' that ``fans revolution'' and promotesoutlawed organizations such as the African National Congress, thelargest guerrilla group fighting South Africa's white-ledgovernment.   Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha has complained aboutnumerous articles in The Weekly Mail, issued two official warningsagainst the newspaper and threatened to close it for three months.   Botha already has suspended two newspapers aimed at SouthAfrica's black majority _ New Nation and South. The Weekly Mail isone of five more papers that have received warnings.   ``Botha warned us ... that our wailing threatens publicsafety,'' The Weekly Mail said in an editorial on its front page.``We deny the charge. Our newspaper kicks at consciences and tearsdown barriers. It does not throw bombs.''   ``Don't let us go quietly. Carry on reading us. Carry onsubscribing. Make a fuss. Wail, dammit,'' the editorial said.   Despite threats of closure, the newspaper continues to pursuecontroversial stories critical of the government and its system ofapartheid, which prohibits blacks from having a voice in nationalaffairs.   Recent articles have challenged government casualty figures forSouth Africans fighting the Marxist government in Angola's civilwar; suggested South African agents were behind the killings ofAfrican National Congress officials abroad; examined the AfricanNational Congress in a report from the group's headquarters inLusaka, Zambia; and provided a detailed account of a black activistwho allegedly was kidnapped and assaulted by the army.   ``We've managed to put issues on the agenda that weren't beingcovered by the larger papers,'' said Harber.   While the newspaper focuses on serious political issues, itregularly finds room for lighter matters. It is the only SouthAfrican newspaper to run the American comic strip Doonesbury, andit has lively culture and sports sections, often written with anacid wit.   Brian Mitchell, the World Boxing Association junior-lightweightchampion who must fight abroad to have his bouts officiallysanctioned, is described by the paper as South Africa's ``onlydiplomat with clout.''   After a white South African sprinter ran 100 meters in 10.06seconds, newspapers and the state-run television network checkedthe record books and proclaimed him the ``world's fourth fastestwhite man.''   A Weekly Mail columnist responded: ``My next sporting goal is tobecome the seventh-fastest, gray-bearded, pink-freckled, left-eyed,sexagenarian, tanned-but-white hurdler over four meters... Glorybeckons.''   When a South American field hockey team competed in South Africaas a ``mystery team'' to avoid criticism for boycott-busting, othernewspapers protected its anonymity.   But The Weekly Mail's staffer attended a game and reported thatknowledgable fans were preoccupied with the weather, repeatedlysaying, ``Chilly.''   Business Day, the country's leading financial daily, describesThe Weekly Mail's political coverage as ``stylish, sophisticated,frequently clever, and aimed at an elite market.''   The weekly paper posed no threat to public safety because it isaimed at the ``gentlest, least violent, most anxious, guilt-ridden,sweetly intentioned middle class,'' a Business Day editorial said.   ``(Botha) and his advisers have neither the general education,nor the wit, to distinguish between revolution and radical chic,''it added.   Harber says staff morale remains high, although it is unclearwhat will happen to the newspaper if it is closed for three months.   ``We've always figured that we would probably be shut down atsome point,'' said Harber. ``It's tough working under these kind ofconditions, but it's something we've had to get used to.''</TEXT></DOC>
