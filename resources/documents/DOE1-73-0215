On the basis of the above, the combination of measures whichmeets the specified strength requirements as a given age and which producesthe lowest cost for each particular pour, can be selected. This methodis an alternative to the selection of measures 'by feel' or 'on the basisof experience' or by using collections of diagrams. However, the resultsare only as reliable as the input data selected for the calculations.Examples of factors of uncertainty are assumptions regarding outdoortemperature and wind velocity. With particular reference to radiant heating,the efficiencies of liquefied gas and electric radiant heaters are analyzed,and the absorption capacity of formwork material and concrete are investigated.Development of temperature in concrete floors is simulated for differentclimatic, insulation and heating conditions. The calculated temperaturedevelopment and concrete strength are compared with the results of fieldstudies made during winter pours of concrete floors in the course ofnormal production. Reduction of strength due to heat curing and deflectionsof concrete floors due to early striking of formwork are discussed andcountermeasures are proposed. With 28 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
