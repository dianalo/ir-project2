Gen.Prosper Avril, has continued the human rights abuses of itspredecessors, three human rights organizations charged Sunday.   ``The persistence of serious human rights violations suggests anongoing refusal by the military to relinquish power to an electedcivilian government,'' the groups' report said.   The 159-page report, issued by Americas Watch, the NationalCoalition for Haitian Refugees, and Caribbean Rights, noted thatAvril's 5-month-old government has vowed to hold elections andpromote human rights.   But it said peasant organizations, trade unions and churchactivists are still subject to military and paramilitary violence,and that ``demonstrations and outspoken critics are also regularlytargeted.'' The Avril government has never prosecuted those involvedin political violence, it added.   It also said that the government, rather than establishing anindependent electoral council, has proposed a procedure forselecting a new electoral commission ``that would be highlysusceptible to military control.''   Since the report was compiled, Avril has agreed to set up anindependent electoral council, as recommended by a forum ofpolitical and civic leaders. In a decree Thursday, the governmentsaid the council would organize and set a date for elections andsupervise the vote.   Avril assumed the presidency Sept. 17 in a coup led byrank-and-file soldiers demanding democratic reforms. The coup oustedLt. Gen. Henri Namphy, whose rule saw widespread repression,including mass killings.   The three human rights groups said their report was based onseven missions to Haiti since November 1987.   Haiti has been racked by political strife for decades,particularly during the reign of President-for-Life Francois ``PapaDoc'' Duvalier, who died in 1971; and his son, Jean-Claude ``BabyDoc'' Duvalier, who was ousted in a coup three years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
