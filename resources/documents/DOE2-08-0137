They are usedto seal a wide range of liquids which can be explosive, flammable, toxicor be potentially dangerous in a number of other ways. They can alsoprovoke expensive plant stoppages and because of the nature of mechanicalseal failures, it is not easy to predict when they will occur. One traditionalsolution to the problem applications has been to use a liquid tandemseal arrangement which provides secondary containment and safety. Whileliquid tandem seals provide an elegant solution, they can however beexpensive, complex and space demanding. Dry running and fully abeyantstandby seals can provide the benefits of liquid tandem seals at muchlower cost and complexity and within smaller space envelopes. This paperlooks at two new developments in this area: a novel abeyant or non-contractingstandby seal and a contracting or dry running standby seal for higherpressure applications where very little leakage is permissible. 12 figs.,4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
