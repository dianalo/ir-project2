Ah, the glamorous world of professional skating!;   He clutches the endof a chipped Formica counter with both hands and starts jumping: up, down, up,down, 25 times, stop, rest a minute, start again. &quot;To warm up my knees,&quot; heexplains, up, down, up, down, the untied laces on his Avias flapping.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE LIFE OF BRIANBRIAN BOITANO BECAME AN ATHLETE, AN OLYMPIAN, ASTAR BY KEEPING BOTH FEET FIRMLY PLANTED ON APATCH OF ICE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  PERFORMANCE  </MEMO><TEXT>     Then it's onto the ice for an hour or so. Linda Leaver, the only coach he'sever had, watches as he works on some routines from the show, &quot;Skating '92,&quot;in which he is now touring. (It plays Monday night at the Cow Palace.) Theroutines are set but he's not satisfied.;   He shares the ice with YvonneGomez, the beautiful former Spanish champion who also is in the show, and witha college skater getting in some practice. Each works alone, intense,encapsulated, self-contained. &quot;He focuses really well on the job to be done,&quot;says Leaver.;   Boitano, 28, has been skating for Leaver since the Saturday in1971 when he wandered into the Sunnyvale Ice Palace with some other kids. Hewas 8. Leaver, who taught a class there, tested him and thought he hadpotential.;   By 1978 he was national junior champion. He finished fifth inthe 1984 Olympics, and was frustrated. Skating is a world of suspicion,tradition, chauvin; ism, where it's hard to outpoint the champ. &quot;I knew Icouldn't pass Scott (Hamilton),&quot; he said a year later.;   Eventually Hamiltonturned professional. By 1988, Boitano was all-everything -- Olympic gold,world champion, national champion. What else was there? He turned pro, hopingthat in skating, as in other sports, open competition, amateurs and prostogether, was around the corner.;   It was, but when the rules changed, thosewho had taken money under the old rules were left out. No grandfather clause.In the Olympics, each sport makes its own rules. In 1992, Michael Jordan canbe an Olympian; Brian Boitano cannot.;   So instead of training for February'sWinter Games in Albertville, France, he is off on his third &quot;theatrical eventon ice,&quot; leading a company studded with champions in a program of solos, duetsand production numbers.;   Which is why he's at the Belmont Iceland early on aThursday morning, jumping up and down in unlaced running shoes to warm up hisknees. &quot;I've never done it for the money,&quot; he says. &quot;It's a lot of hard work,training, being away from home, stuff like that.&quot;;   After practice he has anappointment with his physical therapist to work on knees and hip. No big deal,he says: He's had some problems for a decade.;   &quot;I still think that I have,like, eight to 10 more years of skating left in me,&quot; he says later, and hetalks about an article he's read that says a man can go on improvingphysically until he's 50. &quot;The only difference is the healing time.&quot;; (hbox);  Lean and fit, Brian Boitano is a pasta hound who talks of opening arestaurant someday in San Francisco.;   Raised in Sunnyvale, he now livesalone in a two-story, 1,800-square-foot &quot;cottage&quot; near Fort Mason in SanFrancisco's Marina District that he bought just before the 1989 earthquake,which he and it came through unscathed.;   It has flower boxes and Frenchwindows, &quot;and I have a beautiful garden in back. I think that's why I boughtthe house.&quot; He's added a gazebo and a hot tub.;   For four years he lived witha &quot;best friend,&quot; Lisa Schoeller, whom he met skating when he was 12. When shemoved out, he says, it left &quot;this extra area in the house,&quot; but not enough forhim to find room for the dining room he needs. &quot;I don't know how to finaglethat,&quot; he says.;   He loves to cook; there were 11 for dinner on Thanksgiving,for example. &quot;I'm not a big fan of tomato sauces, although I make themoccasionally.&quot; A favorite pasta? &quot;Bleu cheese and broccoli.&quot;;   His is afamiliar face but a more familiar name. The former occasionally gets himstopped in the street; the latter gets him restaurant reservations, one of theperks. Another of the perks is a new white Jeep, a gift from Chrysler, sponsorof the current tour; he finds the ride a little hard to get used to, after hisbeloved (and very fast) VW Corrado.;   When he's at home he can put on abaseball cap and walk around the neighborhood, shop at the Marina Safeway,without being bothered. &quot;People recognize me, but I think people in SanFrancisco are really cool.&quot; He hates being &quot;made to feel like I didn't belongin a certain place.&quot;;   Groupies? Well, sure, there are fan clubs, and theyknow where he's staying, so it's hard to get in and out of a hotel lobbywithout someone wanting a moment or two of his time. But we're not talking sexon ice here, are we?;   Boitano smiles, but the thought, or the memory,whatever it is, goes unspoken. &quot;No,&quot; he replies. &quot;Uh-uh. No.&quot; He mentions theChamberlain Index: 20,000 women so far. &quot;Please! That's hard to believe. Imean, that's, what? Three women a day? You don't have time.&quot;; (hbox);  Skating weds grace, speed, agility and strength to theatricality and artificein a way that is unique in sports. Jordan doesn't have to stay in a spotlightwhen he shoots or do it to music. Skaters do, and when it's done well, it'selectrifying.;   But at the same time, &quot;professional skating&quot; has a certainconnotation. It means Snoopy. It means cartoon characters dancing with bimbos.It means sequins and cheap glitter, the kind of ersatz Hollywood hell thatgreat athletes from Sonja Henie on down have resorted to in order to make afew bucks when their competition days are over.;   The image drives Boitanonuts. &quot;That's exactly why I started my own show,&quot; he says. &quot;Katarina (Witt)was with Holiday on Ice when I approached her! For me, skating is athletic andexciting, and to camouflage it with all this fluff, like the LasVegas-Hollywood look that the ice shows do. . . .;   &quot;We try for a street look-- a hip look. Who wants to see a bunch of showgirls in feathers going aroundin a circle? . . . People are there to see the skating, you've got to rememberthat.&quot;;   As for the quality of the skating: &quot;I think that I do more in thissituation than I ever did as a competitor.&quot; (Leaver agrees. If anything, shesays, the routines are tougher for having been honed to please the crowd.);  Boitano is not an artist/athlete who succeeds by divine inspiration. Therealso is technique, and hard work and -- says Leaver -- honesty, which is tosay, no excuses.;   So when he says, &quot;I really think that, given the chance,that I can do all the stuff I want to do. It's just a matter of time,&quot; otherskaters probably take notice. This, after all, is a competitor who could haveunleashed a quadruple jump had he needed it to win. &quot;Technically,&quot; he says,&quot;I'm pretty happy with where I'm at now.&quot;;   So he fantasizes. &quot;I wanted to doa swashbuckling number where I swing down from the roof on a rope,&quot; landing atsome kind of ridiculous speed and going, gracefully, into a jump. &quot;Like, thatwould be hard! I'd love to try it!&quot;;   Skating '92, of which Boitano also isartistic director, features a cast full of present and former champions, butit co-stars Witt, the gold medalist in 1984 and '88. The two Olympicchampions, the boyish American and the sexy German, have been togetherprofessionally for three years.;   She was the object of his romantic fantasyin &quot;Canvas of Ice,&quot; his first TV special. He was Don Joseto her Carmen in&quot;Carmen on Ice,&quot; with Canadian skater Brian Orser as Escamillo. &quot;It was a lotof suffering. Which I do well, I must say.&quot; They have toured in two previousBoitano shows, &quot;Skating&quot; and &quot;Skating II.&quot;;   &quot;She's good,&quot; he says. &quot;She'svery good. We're a lot the same. We treat each project the same way. We'reperfectionists; I'm probably a little bit more of a perfectionist than she. Weunderstand each other.&quot;;   As for their personal relationship, Boitano hasgiven up trying to explain. &quot;Because people don't listen, I just say, 'It'snobody's business.' That's my standard answer now.&quot;;   People think thatbecause the two are together so often on the ice, where even Boitano admitsthere's a sexual electricity between them, they must be together off the iceas well. She, after all, still lives in Germany. &quot;They don't really know whatour relationship is,&quot; he says, somewhat mysteriously.; (hbox);   Back in thefreezing rink, Leaver watches as her prize pupil darts and spins around thezamboni that is cleaning the ice. &quot;It's not right to compare out of an age,&quot;she says -- a Witt with a Kristi Yamaguchi, a Boitano with a Dick Button. Thelevel of competition changes, and the great ones change with it.;   &quot;It's likeanything. I mean, runners -- runners do four-minute miles as a matter ofroutine now.&quot; Diet -- training -- but more than those, the level ofexpectation changes. &quot;People have a lot more tools now.&quot;;   Nevertheless: &quot;Ithink he is just so far above other skaters in his time -- in his technique,his artistic level, mentally, everything. It's phenomenal. . . .;   &quot;I mean,&quot;she exclaims, watching Boitano at work, &quot;you don't even know what he's doing.To do that -- on new blades -- early in the morning -- after he's cooled down-- and he hasn't made a mistake out there yet. He's such a finely tunedathlete. He notices everything -- an extra five feet on the rink -- lines --shadows -- and he adjusts. I think really great athletes are like that.&quot;;Skating '92; When: 8 p.m. Monday; Where: Cow Palace, Daly City.; Tickets:$35.50, $25.50; (408) 998-2277, (510) 762-2277.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID L.
