The real issue is not repeal, but &quot;coal capability.&quot;    To set the record straight, the coal industry has consistently supported repeal of the demand restraints in the act. This law both prohibits (with certain exemptions) the use of oil or natural gas in new power plants and requires that these boilers be capable of using an alternative fuel, usually coal. If natural gas or oil is the cheapest fuel available, electric utilities should be able to use these fuels. For that reason, the National Coal Association favors doing away with the &quot;demand-use&quot; restrictions in the law. Coal is very competitive with oil and natural gas, and we expect it to continue that way.    But the law's requirement that new power plants be &quot;coal-capable&quot; should not be changed. This provision concerns the ability to switch between fuels as economics dictates. A power plant capable of burning coal can readily switch to oil or natural gas, but a plant built for oil or natural-gas use cannot be converted to coal.    We all learned a painful lesson in the 1960s and 1970s when electric utilities on the East Coast changed from coal to oil and then back, with much difficulty, to coal. It was impossible to convert natural-gas plants to coal. And we all paid in higher oil imports and higher energy and electricity prices for that lack of flexibility. The coal-capability requirement protects against a repetition of that experience.    Most observers agree that new generating capacity must be planned now and built soon to meet increased demand over the next decade. That's why the issue has become important for the 100th Congress. The question is: Will the next increment of new capacity be limited to burning only oil or natural gas?    The front-end cost of a coal-capable plant is higher, but over the life of the plant its lower fuel costs more than make up the difference. For the small up-front premium, utilities can ensure their ability to produce economically priced electricity even if their primary fuel supply is interrupted or suddenly becomes less economical than alternatives.    Being coal-capable does not mean that utilities must maintain stocks of coal, install flue-gas scrubber units, or actually burn coal if oil or natural gas is in fact cheaper. It just means new power plants must be able to use an alternative fuel if circumstances demand.    That kind of flexibility is sound public policy.    Carl E. Bagge   President, National Coal Assn.
