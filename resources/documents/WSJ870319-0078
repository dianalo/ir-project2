The resignation, which was announced Tuesday, also completes the transfer of all economic power to Finance Minister Dilson Funaro. It was Mr. Funaro's rejection of Mr. Sayad's &quot;New Economy&quot; plan -- presented to the president Feb. 20 -- that finally prompted the resignation.    &quot;I waited for as long as I could to see if the government would act,&quot; Mr. Sayad said. &quot;Now, at least, it will be obliged to do something.&quot;    Confusion, however, reigned over what that might be. For although Mr. Sayad's departure was dismissed by some as insignificant because his influence has been diminished for some months, it nonetheless seemed to mark two crucial changes. While he was there, Mr. Funaro's inaction could be attributed to disputes with Mr. Sayad over policy. At the same time, President Sarney could hedge his bets, using the two economic ministers as alternative formulators of policy. Now, in the words of economist Edmar Bacha, &quot;both Mr. Funaro and the president are completely exposed.&quot;    Several sources said this could put strains on their hitherto harmonious relationship. Mr. Funaro is known to want to formalize his control over economic policy by creating and heading an Economy Ministry. This would involve either the complete suppression of the Planning Ministry, or its subjugation to a minor role. But it is not yet clear whether President Sarney is prepared to accept this move, which would amount to an overwhelming commitment to Mr. Funaro.    &quot;If the president wants to go with Mr. Funaro all the way, he may sink with Mr. Funaro all the way. That's what he's up against now,&quot; said Lawrence Pih, a top Sao Paulo businessman.    Senior New York bankers said Mr. Funaro and President Sarney are much more vulnerable because of Mr. Sayad's resignation, and will be held responsible for any more deterioration in the economy. Several U.S. bankers and economists, who declined to be identified, said that mounting domestic pressure may, within the next six months, force Mr. Funaro to resign. They claim Mr. Funaro is the biggest obstacle to negotiations between Brazil and its creditors.    In an interview with this newspaper last Friday, Mr. Funaro conceded he didn't know what measures to adopt against inflation, or when a program might be in place. But pressure to show that Brazil can control inflation is certain to mount over the next two weeks as the March 31 deadline approaches for a decision by banks on whether to maintain $15 billion in trade and interbank credit lines.    Mr. Sayad's economic program aimed at controlling inflation over the next 180 days through a 90-day period of price adjustment, followed by a 90-day period in which prices would have been frozen or strictly controlled. Inflation last month totaled 13.9%, down from 15% a year earlier and 16.8% in January.    In the Sayad plan, other measures included the elimination of wage-price indexation, a tight monetary policy, a program of debt-equity conversion, an end to subsidies worth about $2 billion a year and other steps to cut the federal deficit. &quot;It wasn't a perfect plan, but it was the only one the government had. Now there's nothing but the prospect of further disarray,&quot; commented a senior officer at an international bank in Brazil.    Although the monthlong obstruction of his plan was the final catalyst for Mr. Sayad's departure, he also clashed with Mr. Funaro over the moratorium.    According to a top Planning Ministry official, this was opposed by Mr. Sayad, who, in the week before its announcement, pleaded several times with the president to delay any action until a domestic economic program was in place and a strategy for debt talks prepared. In the past three weeks, Mr. Sayad's irritation increased, spurred by a sense that the political capital gained by the moratorium -- which might have been used to push through tough economic measures -- has been squandered.    The major banks don't want to walk away from Brazil, the eighth-largest economy in the Western world. And privately they say they can afford to wait until Brazil gets its economic house in order -- even if that takes many months.    U.S. bankers make no secret of their impatience with Mr. Funaro. Several bankers recall that it took months and much domestic political pressure to unseat Argentina's economy minister, Bernardo Grinspun, and central bank president, Enrique Garcia Vazquez, in February 1985. Mr. Grinspun had spent the past months opposing an accord with the International Monetary Fund, which was finally negotiated by his successor, Juan Sourrouille, then planning minister. He also had opposed Mr. Sourrouille's negotiations with the country's creditor banks.    Despite its public hostility to the IMF, Brazil is quietly staying in touch with that agency. Its ambassador to Washington, Marcilio Marques Moreira, last Saturday dined with Michel Camdessus, the new IMF managing director, and with Alexandre Kafka, Brazil's director at the IMF.    But a return to the IMF would only be conceivable if Mr. Funaro left office. Thus, the president is facing a difficult choice, and the delay in naming a successor to Mr. Sayad seems to reflect this. For the nomination may well provide an indication of the degree of his faith in Mr. Funaro. And if he commits himself now to the finance minister, he will be committed also to the upshot of the moratorium, as well as to a domestic economic policy which remains an unknown.    Some analysts contend Mr. Funaro's policies will only lead to hyperinflation, recession and international isolation. In that case, President Sarney's six-year mandate -- already a hotly debated subject in the newly elected Constituent Assembly -- would probably be curtailed, these analysts say.    ---   Peter Truell in New York contributed to this article.    ---   Economy Grew 8.2% in '86   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's gross national product grew 8.2% in 1986, slower than 1985's 8.3% expansion, the government said.    Gross national product measures a nation's output of goods and services.    Industry led last year's expansion, with 12.1% growth, while the service sector grew 8.3%. However, the farm sector contracted 7.3%.    President Jose Sarney has said Brazil will seek to maintain a 5% to 6% growth rate through the rest of this decade. </TEXT></DOC>
