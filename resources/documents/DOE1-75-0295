Successes in the solution of this problemmay be achieved only by improving both experimental and theoretical researchmethods. Large difficulties which occur when attempting to describe theoreticallythe thermodynamics of liquid hydrogen have been due to developing quantumeffects in the liquid phase.</TEXT></DOC>
