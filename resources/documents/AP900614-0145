Bush signed a proclamation the Senate had requested in aresolution.   ``The right to liberty and self-determination, free and fairelections, a better life for themselves and for their children,these are just aspirations of the people of Estonia, Latvia, andLithuania. On this Baltic Freedom Day, we reaffirm our support forthem,'' Bush said in the proclamation.   He reiterated the U.S. position, which does not recognize theforced incorporation of the three countries by the Soviet Union in1940.   ``During that fateful summer, Soviet troops invaded and occupiedthe Baltic States. The rigged elections that followed put an end toBaltic self-determination.''   Bush noted, however, the self-determination moves in Latvia,Estonia and Lithuania in the past year and the democratic electionsheld.   ``In decisions reflecting the will of the Baltic people,Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia have asserted their intention torestore their independence.''   ``We support self-determination for the Baltic peoples and wecall upon the Soviet Union to enter a good-faith dialogue withrepresentatives of the Baltic governments who received popularmandates in free and fair elections. We are encouraged by recentsteps in that direction and hope that a full and productivedialogue will materialize,'' Bush's proclamation said.   Bush earlier in the week lauded Soviet President MikhailGorbachev's talks with Lithuanian leaders as ``a significantchange.''   The Baltic states all are struggling for independence from theSoviet Union.   In Lithuania, the most aggressive in its breakaway move, theSoviets retaliated with an economic blockade, but began to lift theblockade by restoring a small amount of fuel export on Wednesday.   The Bush administration has tried to walk a fine line in itsreaction to the Soviets' heavyhandedness in the Baltics so as notto further weaken the domestically embattled Gorbachev.   Administration officials initially raised Lithuania as astumbling block to normalizing trade relations with the SovietUnion, but subsequently eased off that demand, saying Lithuania wasnever directly linked to U.S. willingness to enter a trade pact.</TEXT></DOC>
