Sweet harmony doesn't exactly spring to mind.   More like bitter divisions that spilled over into street battlesin Chicago 20 years ago. Or the last-ditch floor fight that Sen.Edward M. Kennedy waged against President Carter in 1980. Or anasty little firefight over selection of a new party chairman fouryears ago that weakened Walter F. Mondale almost on the eve of hisnomination.   But this time officials in Michael Dukakis' campaign and otherDemocrats, pointing to quick work on platform, rules andcredentials issues, say they expect to present a unified front totheir four-day prime-time television audience beginning on July 18.Barring an unexpected disruption by Jesse Jackson or his supportersover the selection of a vice presidential running mate, of course.   ``The party is as unified as it has been since 1964, and thatwas when you had an incumbent president,'' says Paul Kirk,Democratic party chairman _ and the man who managed Kennedy'sunsuccessful campaign in 1980.   Kirk's view is semi-shared by Eddie Mahe, a Republican politicalconsultant. ``They are willing to subordinate any and all personaland interest group agendas in the interests of victory,'' he saysof this year's Democrats.   But Mahe added that Democratic unity is likely to proveshort-lived and that special interests will reassert themselves ifDukakis wins the White House in the fall.   ``The day they win, Katie bar the door,'' he said.   That's a problem Democrats will worry about if and when the timecomes.   Dukakis has made a number of largely symbolic concessions toJackson since the primary season ended, and party officials arecrowing about the relatively smooth transition between the primarycampaign and the convention.   Jackson, who will have the support of more 1,100 delegates atthe convention, has said repeatedly that he deserves a vicepresidential offer, and that he has decided whether he would acceptone but won't say what his decision is. He and his wife will havedinner at the Dukakis' Massachusetts home on Monday, and the topicof the vice presidency is expected to come up.   Dukakis is widely expected by his aides to select a differentrunning mate, and the Massachusetts governor frequently quotesJackson's earlier statements that a nominee is entitled to make hisown pick.   Other Democrats say they doubt Jackson will raise a furor if heis passed over, although there has been no clue about what mighthappen if Dukakis chooses a political partner whom Jackson findsoffensive.   ``I think he has been and will be very positive no matter whathappens,'' said Rep. Richard Gephardt, the Missouri congressman whochallenged for the presidential nomination last winter.   With the exception of the vice presidential nomination, thisyear's Democratic campaign has been remarkably free of the types ofdisputes that produced divisions in earlier conventions.   This year:   _ Dukakis wrapped up the nomination on the final day of theprimaries, and unlike in 1980 and 1984 no one has questioned hiscontrol over a majority of delegates.   Jackson has continued to campaign publicly, occasionally snipingat the Massachusetts governor, but thus far has never suggestedsummoning his forces for an all-out fight such as the one Kennedywaged in 1980.   The other, losing contenders generally have endorsed Dukakiswarmly and most of them are expected to speak at the convention,although Gary Hart will be in Atlanta writing a newspaper columnand offering commentary for an Italian television audience.   _ Democratic draftsmen came up with the shortest platform indecades, in keeping with Dukakis' desires and Kirk's hope ofavoiding a ``litany of social, cultural or ideological buzzwords.''   Dukakis yielded to Jackson on some issues, notably his desire tobrand South Africa a terrorist state and his call for periodicincreases in the federal minimum wage to keep pace with inflation.   Jackson has described the platform as bland, and his aides havefiled a dozen minority planks for possible votes at the convention.But Kirk says, ``If there are planks that will be discussed anddebated it will be a civil agreement to disagree.''   Dukakis aides sound almost like they welcome a floor vote todemonstrate their stand against higher taxes and a Pentagon freeze,two key Jackson demands. ``There may be some fights and that's anormal part of the process and Michael Dukakis will stick to hisposition,'' says Leslie Dach, the campaign's communicationsdirector.   _ Dukakis agreed to several concessions sought by Jackson onparty rules covering the 1992 campaign. That mollified Jacksonwithout costing this year's winner anything. Dukakis will not careabout the selection of delegates in 1992 if he loses this year _and won't have to worry about it if he wins and is running forre-election.   Thus, he agreed to a sharp reduction in the number of automaticsuper delegates who will attend the 1992 convention, the partyofficials who have overwhelmingly favored Dukakis this year. Healso consented to Jackson's demand to award all other delegates in1992 in proportion to the vote received in primaries.   _ All potential credentials challenges were ironed out betweenthe Dukakis and Jackson forces, averting a floor fight. Jacksonpicked up eight new delegates in New Jersey; six in Puerto Rico andthree in Kansas in the process. Most of them came from Dukakis, whohas more than he needs.</TEXT></DOC>
