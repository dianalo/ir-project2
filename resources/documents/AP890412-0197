The Senate Banking Committee was expected to divide along partylines with the 12 Democrats outvoting their nine Republicancolleagues to reject Bush's proposal to not include in the federalbudget the immediate $50 billion taxpayer cost of the bailout.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, in a letter Wednesday to thepanel's chairman, Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., did not repeat hisearlier threat to recommend that Bush veto the package if the $50billion bailout cost is included in the fiscal 1989 budget.   But, in commmending as ``on balance, meritorious,'' proposedSenate changes in the new, tougher regulations and capitalrequirements that Bush would impose on the industry, Brady said theadministration still opposes Riegle's plan to reflect the cost ofthe bailout now rather than over 30 years.   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the chief advocate in the House ofsuch a plan, said he is holding off on proposing it after receivinga letter Wednesday from White House budget director Richard Darman,who said he would refuse to count all of the spending in 1989.   If Darman carried out the threat, it would wreak havoc onefforts to meet the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit targets in 1990 and1991. Schumer said Darman has the sole power to make that decisionbut said he was still looking for a way to circumvent him.   Riege said his plan would avoid the ``accounting and budgetgimmickry'' of Bush's proposal by reducing the interest costs offinancing the bailout through direct Treasury borrowing at asavings of $4.5 billion to taxpayers over the next three decades.   Utah Sen. Jake Garn, the committee's ranking Republican, said hestill has a ``fundamental disagreement'' over allowing the bailoutcosts to swell the federal deficit in apparent violation of acongressionally mandated reduction target that already has beenexceeded.   All three versions _ Bush's, the Senate panel's and one beingput together in the House Banking Committee's financialinstitutions subcommitee _ would use the $50 billion over the nextthree years to pay for the bailouts of some 200 insolvent Sandamp;Ls in1988 plus 350 more that are insolvent or nearly so.   They also provide for an additional $33 billion _ $300 million ayear of it coming from the industry _ to take care of thriftinsolvencies expected in the 1990s, especially if interest ratescontinue to rise or the nation falls into a recession.   ``The president asked us to move quickly and that's what we'vedone,'' Riegle said. ``We've given him a strong bill with manystreamlined reforms and changes that can prevent in the future arepeat of what's happened in the past.''   Unlike changes made by the House subcommittee, the Senatepanel's version retains Bush's proposal to double by June 1991 therequired capital that Sandamp;L operators must have to qualify forfederal deposit insurance.   Bush would not shut down institutions that fail to meet thatstandard then but he would prevent them from growing. Both Senateand House versions would allow undercapitalized thrifts to continuegrowing, but would restrict that growth primarily to home mortgagesand consumer loans.   The House panel, which finished its third full day of draftingthe bill, rejected Bush's measure to make Sandamp;Ls have the sameminimum capital requirements as banks _ $6 for every $100 ofoutstanding loans _ voting 24-23 Tuesday to keep the current floor_ $3 for every $100 in loans _ but requiring for the first timethat half that amount be in real money.   Both panels, however, have voted to phase out many of whatcritics call ``smoke and mirrors accounting fictions.''   Those accounting practices have allowed Sandamp;Ls to escape puttingup their own cash or retained earnings by counting as capital suchitems as investments in non-thrift subsidiaries, ``good will,''their own borrowings and even losses on bad loans.   Bush would immediatly end many such bookkeeping practices.   By a 27-16 vote Wednesday, the House subcommittee voted tocontinue allowing Sandamp;Ls to funnel depositors' fund into subsidiariesto invest in risky areas such as commercial real estatedevelopment, fast food franchises and junk bonds.   The Senate panel's version would phase out such practices overfive years but there were disagreements among senators over whetherto do it in equal yearly installments or all at once.   The House panel also approved Wednesday a measure by itschairman, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-N.J., requiring Sandamp;Ls toconcentrate 80 percent of their lending on residential mortgages,compared with the 60 percent now required.   But the measure also broadly defines housing to includeconsumer, education and small business loans and no Sandamp;L would bepenalized if the mix of its current loan portfolio does not meetthe requirement.   The subcommittee also approved, 34-12, a measure sponsored byRep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the full committee,which would require the government to offer some of the repossessedproperty from failed Sandamp;Ls for housing poor people. It authorizesspending $574 million to subsidize rents on the properties or offerdiscounts or low-interest loans to purchasers.   It adopted another measure, by voice vote, imposing governmentoversight on the agency in charge of selling repossessed realestate and establishing procedures designed to guard against thedumping of the property at firesale prices.</TEXT></DOC>
