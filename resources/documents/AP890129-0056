The election also was a major setback for West Berlin's governingChristian Democrats, which lost its parliamentary majority and plansto form a coalition with the left-of-center Social Democrats.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in an interview with the ARDtelevision network that he was ``alarmed'' by the Republicans'showing in West Berlin.   The Republican party campaigned on a platform of ridding WestBerlin of foreigners, who make up about 10 percent of the city's 2million people.   While public opinion often is directed against the growing numberof foreigners in West Germany, Sunday's election was the mostdramatic example in recent years of a major election success for aparty with stridently anti-foreigner views.   The Republicans won 8.5 percent of the vote, capturing 10 of 144seats in the legislature, according to the ARD television network.   The Christian Democrats won 36 percent of the vote and 47 seats,and the Social Democrats won 37 percent of the vote and 48 seats,ARD said.   The Christian Democrats lost nearly 10 percent of its votersupport and 22 seats from the last election four years ago.   About 5,000 people, most of them young, demonstrated in downtownWest Berlin late Sunday night to protest the far-right Republicans.They carried signs saying ``Never Again Fascism'' and other slogans.   West Berlin's governing mayor, Christian Democrat EberhardDiepgen, said the Republicans' successful bid to enter thelegislature ``should not be allowed to cast the city and itsresidents in a false light.''   Walter Momper, head of Berlin's Social Democrats, said ``it's badfor the city ... that the Republicans were able to achieve this.''   Franz Schoenhuber, who was a member of the Nazi SS troops duringWorld War II, is federal head of the Republican party, formed in1983. Its West Berlin leader is Bernhard Andres, a city policeofficer.   In the ARD television interview, Diepgen said he will seeknegotiations with the Social Democrats to form a ``grand coalition.''   ARD said Diepgen's coalition partners, the Free Democrats, lostall 12 of their seats in the legislature.   According to the ARD forecasts, the Free Democrats polled 3.6percent of the vote, less than the 5 percent required for alegislative seat.   The left-wing Alternative List party kept its 15 legislativeseats with a 11.5 percent showing in the election, ARD said.   Just under 80 percent of West Berlin's voters cast ballots,according to television forecasts, compared with 83.6 percent in1985.</TEXT></DOC>
