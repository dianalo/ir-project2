No major banks followed the Fed's cut in the discount rateby reducing the prime rate from the 9% level it has been atsince early February. But bankers and analysts say anationwide cut in the prime rate to 8.75% and perhaps to aslow as 8.5% could occur by week's end.</LP><TEXT>   After the Fed cut the discount rate, it lowered the targetlevel for the important federal funds rate to 5 3/4%. Thefederal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge on loansto each other, is more of a catalyst for overall interestrate movements -- including rates on bank certificates ofdeposit -- than the discount rate, which the Fed sets onmoney it loans to banks. The Fed yesterday injected fundsinto the banking system, bringing the federal funds rate downto 5 3/4% before it bounced back to 6% because of whateconomists said was end-of-the-month settlement demands formoney.   Still, bankers were taking a cautious stance before theycommit to a lower prime rate. The prime rate directly affectssmall and medium-sized business borrowers and consumers withadjustable-rate home equity loans that are linked to theprime.   &quot;There won't be any change in the prime before we learnwhere the fed funds rate settles,&quot; said Richard Kovacevich,president of Norwest Corp., a Minneapolis-based bankingconcern.   Even if banks do match the quarter-point reduction in thefederal funds rate, the difference between the prime and thefunds rate will remain wide, enabling banks to continue tomake money on each loan, industry analysts say.   &quot;The banking system needs time to restore basic levels ofprofitability,&quot; said Thomas Hanley of Salomon Brothers Inc.Mr. Hanley expects the spread between the federal funds rateand the prime rate to remain considerably wider than thetraditional two percentage points for the rest of the year.As of Monday it was 3.11 percentage points, compared with2.86 points at the end of the first quarter and 2.32 pointsat the end of last year.   Southwest Bank, St. Louis, has said it will lower itsprime rate to 8.75% from 9% effective today. That banktraditionally has been among the first to lower the prime.   The Fed's action was taken in the face of continuedsluggish loan demand and a need to stimulate the econonmy.&quot;Precious few customers we talk to see real signs ofrecovery,&quot; said Thomas Theobald, chairman of ContinentalBank. &quot;I suspect the same information has gotten to the Fed.&quot;   Whether the cut in the discount rate and a new federalfunds rate have a broad impact also depends on the reactionof the long-term bond market. Lately, long-term bond rateshave continued high as short-term rates kept sliding. &quot;Iflong rates come down there will be more movement infixed-rate mortgages and business investment,&quot; said NormanRobertson, chief economist of Mellon Bank.   Even if that doesn't occur, Mr. Robertson said, the Fed'saction &quot;is an important move, representing a reaction to aspate of dismal economic statistics.&quot;   How much of a stimulus the Fed's action prompts willdepend on whether banks go beyond a quarter-point cut. Themargin between the cost of bank funds and base lending rateshas become so large lately and corporate loan demand soanemic that a prime-rate cut of half a point, to 8 1/2%,would be appropriate, says William Sullivan, money marketeconomist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Banks' cost of fundsis usually a blend of a number of rates, including thecommercial paper rate, the rate on certificates of depositsand the Eurodollar CD rate.   &quot;A cut in the prime rate is inevitable,&quot; Mr. Sullivansaid. What is in doubt, he said, is whether it will be aquarter-point or a half-point.   A larger cut in the prime rate wouldn't necessarily helpconsumer loan rates, which have become relatively higher asbanks' cost of funds have fallen. Over the past two years,while yields on bank certificate of deposit of less than oneyear have fallen by more than three percentage points, andfive-year CDs have lost two percentage points, credit cardloan rates have risen from 18.09% to 18.92%, said RobertHeady, president of Bank Rate Monitor. He adds that personalunsecured loan rates have risen during that time and that30-year mortgages have come down from 10.99% to 9.37%.   &quot;Joe Citizen is picking up the tab for bad commercialloans,&quot; said Mr. Heady. Stephen Brobeck, executive directorof the Consumer Federation of America, added that &quot;only asmall number of banks are in trouble, but a great many arehiding behind that pretense to profiteer.&quot; His associationissued a report early in April outlining the extent to whichconsumer loan rates haven't kept pace with CD rates.   Bankers, however, were quick to defend their net interestmargins.   Irwin Kellner, chief economist of Manufacturers HanoverTrust, said that regulatory insistence on improved capitalratios and more reserves for loan losses means that &quot;the onlyway to meet those demands is to widen spread and bring moredown to the bottom line.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;Discount Benchmark Is Cut By HalfPoint, to 5.5%; Federal Funds to 5.75%&quot; -- WSJ May 1, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
