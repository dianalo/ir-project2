One would providefor alternate train service between the Almaden and Santa Teresa stations withChynoweth as the transfer point. The other would extend train service directlyto the Santa Teresa station but use a shuttle bus between Almaden andChynoweth.;    Commission members will make their final decision on whatoption to recommend to the county board of supervisors on Jan. 23.;   Although the original light rail plan called for train service between bothSanta Teresa and Almaden, Mike Aro, service development manager for busoperations said as the new light rail system came closer to implementation itbecame apparent that other options should be considered.;    Aro told thecommission last Wednesday that he believes the plan that utilizes a shuttlebus between Almaden and Chynoweth the most practical. He said it will resultin a system that is easier to understand and will reduce the need for timetables.;    &quot;Our goal is to try to provide the best possible service to themost people,&quot; Aro said.;    He added that direct service on Santa Teresamatches the predicted demand as projected in the number of parking spacesbuilt at each station, 2,537 at Santa Teresa and only 544 at Almaden.;    ButNancy Rydell, a public relations representative for the Atrium, a retirementcommunity near the Oakridge stop located on the Almaden branch of the lightrail, said train service should be extended on all branches.;    &quot;We have200-plus residents that are age 70 and above. Our main concern is that thelight rail be accessible for them,&quot; she said.;    And Jerry Shrum, presidentof the Almaden Valley Community Association said he believes there is enoughdemand among residents in the Almaden Valley to make extending the systemworthwhile.;    &quot;We're all fed up with driving on Almaden Expressway and, withall the construction going on on Almaden Expressway, the most logical accessto north San Jose is by light rail,&quot; he said.;    Shrum said he believesshuttle buses will discourage would-be riders because of the inconvenience.;   &quot;They'll get on the shuttle bus and travel for maybe a minute and thenthey'll have to get off and wait another four minutes to get on the train,&quot; hesaid.;    Santa Clara County Transportation Agency spokesman Bruce Kosanovicsaid the Almaden area is not being shortchanged by the shuttle proposal.;   &quot;With the shuttle proposal they'll actually be getting better service,&quot; hesaid.;    If trains were to alternate between the Santa Teresa and AlmadenStations it would mean people would have to wait 20 minutes for a train,Kosanovic said.;    But if the shuttle proposal were accepted, there wouldonly be a 10-minute wait between trains, he said.;    &quot;It's a trade-offbetween frequency of service or the inconvenience of the transfer,&quot; Kosanovicsaid.;    But Shrum insists that the transportation agency at least tryextending the light rail service to the Almaden station.;    &quot;They can do itfor six months and if it doesn't work then fine, but they need to turn aroundand look at why they built the stop in the first place,&quot; he said.;    Shrum,along with commission member Amal Shinha said they plan on drafting a thirdalternative that would involve using direct train service to the AlmadenStation during peak commuting hours and shuttle bus service during times whendemand is considerably less.;    IF YOU'RE INTERESTEDThe transportationcommission will meet on Jan. 23 at the County Building, 70 W. Hedding St., SanJose, at 7:30 p.m. to make its final recommendation on the light rail issue.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LORI ARATANI, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910116  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  671  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 16, 199100016291,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
