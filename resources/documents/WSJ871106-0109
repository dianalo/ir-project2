Big federal farm subsidy payments, meanwhile, continue to buoy all farm lenders. Farm Credit System said its problem loans declined during the quarter, as borrowers flush with government cash paid off loans. And the number of private farm banks imperiled by problems dipped slightly, according to the latest federal data, as their burden of repossessed farm land rose only slightly.    Brent Beesley, president of the Farm Credit Corporation of America, an arm of the giant Farm Credit System, cautioned that its financial condition remains &quot;bleak,&quot; and said the system still needs a multibillion federal bailout. The third-quarter profit won't affect bailout legislation for the system, the two key congressional sponsors said yesterday.    The system's $4 million profit for the third quarter was its first since the second quarter of 1985, the year the system began reporting billions of dollars of losses and it became apparent it would need a bailout to survive. In last year's third quarter, the system had a loss of $560 million.    Without use of the unusual accounting, which involved taking $93 million out of the system's reserve for loan losses, it would have posted a loss of $89 million for the latest period. That reflects a sharp narrowing in the system's spread -- the difference between what it receives on loans and what it pays on bonds and notes -- that is likely to continue in coming quarters, producing further operating losses.    Taking funds out of the loan-loss reserve is allowed under generally accepted accounting principles, but is highly unusual. &quot;It's very rarely seen,&quot; said an official close to the system. The reversals were allowed because the system is making nearly no new loans that it would need reserves for, its problem loans have declined, and the big federal subsidy payments are both leading borrowers to repay some loans previously considered shaky and have bolstered farm land prices in recent months. Farm land is ultimately the collateral for most agricultural loans.    &quot;It shows if you throw enough money at a problem, some of it actually gets to where it's needed,&quot; the official said of the huge government subsidy payments.    Those payments have been accelerated this year by the Department of Agriculture. &quot;That's been a major factor in helping farmers make their payments this year,&quot; Mr. Beesley said. If the agency doesn't accelerate its payment schedule for 1988 as well, he acknowledged, Farm Credit could see its problem loans almost immediately begin to rise again. That could also force the system to take a less optimistic view of farm land prices, and begin again building -- instead of reducing -- its loss reserves.    But for now, those payments are helping all farm lenders. According to the latest Federal Reserve Board data compiled by Veribanc Inc., a Woburn, Mass., consulting concern, the number of farm banks with problem loans bigger than capital -- a leading indicator of failure -- declined to 180 on June 30, compared with 184 on March 31.    A farm bank has 25% or more of its loans to farmers. The number of banks facing potential failure peaked at 230 on June 30, 1986.    The flood of federal cash is allowing many farmers to catch up on their delinquent debts and allowed many banks to clean up their loan portfolio. &quot;The foreclosures and bankruptcies have slowed to some extent,&quot; said Roy L. Hendrickson, assistant vice president of the First State Bank of Gage, Okla.    In fact, the biggest problem many private farm banks face is finding loans to make. Most farmers aren't willing to take out new loans so loan volume has fallen 30%, Mr. Hendrickson said.    Through the first nine months of the year, the number of farm bank failures fell to 40 compared with 47 for the same period in 1986.    Although the crisis among private farm banks seems to be easing, few see any strong signs of a big recovery anytime soon. Among other things, one of the biggest factors in the improvement of farm banks has been the firming of farm land prices.    Lenders are concerned that the Agriculture Department's plan to trim many crop support programs next year will erode farm land prices just as prices appear to be recovering from a tailspin that began in 1981. &quot;If the government price supports drop, our land prices will drop right along with them,&quot; said Daniel Poppe, vice president of First National Bank of Wahoo, Neb.    According to the Veribanc report, the value of agricultural land held by the nation's farm banks on June 30, the latest date available, edged up slightly to $742.1 million from $739.7 million for March 31.    Rep. Kika de la Garza (D., Texas), chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, dismissed the significance of the Farm Credit System's $4 million profit. &quot;It shouldn't have any bearing on our legislation,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem banks are still there. Four million dollars can go in a blink of the eye.&quot;    In May, Mr. Beesley told Congress that the system could need as much as $6 billion in federal assistance. Yesterday, he wouldn't say what the latest assistance projections are, but he said one clue to what the system has told lawmakers would be the House bill's figure of $2.5 billion for fiscal 1988 and the Senate bill's figure of $2.8 billion for the first year.    Senate Agriculture Chairman Patrick Leahy said that the farm credit legislation, despite the third-quarter profit, remains urgently needed. The Senate could vote on the bailout package within two weeks and send it to conference, Sen. Leahy said. He said he hopes to reach an agreement on the &quot;parameters&quot; of the legislation before Christmas. </TEXT></DOC>
