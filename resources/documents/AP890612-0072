Elmer is correct first name for Alabama Woman.</HEAD><BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today made it easier torecover lawyers' fees for people who win disputes with thegovernment over Social Security benefits.   By a 5-4 vote, the court said the government must reimburse legalfees incurred during administrative proceedings that a federal courthas ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct.   The decision is a victory for Elmer Hudson, an Alabama woman whowon disability benefits in a dispute with the government.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in her opinion for the court, saidrequiring the award of legal fees in such cases is in keeping with afederal law _ the Equal Access to Justice Act _ giving lawyers anincentive to represent the needy.   The law demands reimbursement of legal fees for more than justcourt proceedings, she said.   ``We find it difficult to ascribe to Congress an intent to throwthe Social Security claimant a lifeline that it knew was a footshort,'' said O'Connor.   She was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall,Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and JusticesByron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.   White, in an opinion joined by the other dissenters, said thecourt misread the law.   ``Our duty is to apply statutes as they were enacted by Congress,not to take it upon ourselves to overcome the political realitiesthat blocked what we might consider to be good legislation,'' hesaid.   The case began when Mrs. Hudson filed a Social Secuirtydisability claim in September 1981. She said a variety of physicaland emotional ailments prevented her from continuing to work as amaid and janitor.   An administrative law judge of the Health and Human Servicesagency denied her claim, ruling that none of Mrs. Hudson's ailmentswas so severe as to render her disabled.   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the decision in1985. The appeals court said Mrs. Hudson's impairments must beconsidered in combination and sent the case back to the Health andHuman Services agency.   An administrative law judge then determined she was disabledsince May 1981 and granted her benefits.   The 11th Circuit court last year said the government now mustreimburse Mrs. Hudson for attorneys' fees she incurred during thesecond round of administrative proceedings.   The former Reagan administration, before it left office inJanuary, asked the Supreme Court to reverse the appeals court ruling.   Justice Department lawyers argued that the administrativeproceedings ordered by the 11th Circuit court were not adversarialin the way that court proceedings are and therefore said legal feesshould not be recoverable.   The case is Sullivan vs. Hudson, 88-616.</TEXT></DOC>
