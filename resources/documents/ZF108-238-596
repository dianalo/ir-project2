Whatever else the perfect user interface mayprovide, it's widely agreed that it should be consistent.andP;  The bulk of thehuman aspects of computing literature (and we are talking bulk as in bulk)proclaims the need for user-interface consistency apodictically; that is tosay, as a necessary truth beyond even the softest whisper of the merestpossibility of repudiation.andM;So the appearance of a paper by Jonathan Grudin, outrageously titled &quot;TheCase Against User-Interface Consistency,&quot; in the pretigious Communications ofthe ACM [1] has set some ergonomic teeth agrating and human-factors bloodaboiling.andP;  We have become conditioned of late to headlines such as&quot;Bulgarians Renounce Marxism/Leninism&quot; and &quot;Mother Theresa Denies DrugCharges.&quot;andP;  But Grudin's paper is seen as an assertion that truth is false andfalsehood is true.andP;  Such propositions could mean the collapse of all nationaluniverses as well as the one we inhabit.andM;However, as Grudin points out, the human factors lobby has never been able tocome up with a widely accepted definition of consistency as applied to theuser interface.andP;  Grudin writes: &quot;Acknowledging the difficulty of defining theterm, one prominent interface designer said, 'I know it when I see it.'&quot;  Ithink we can all sympathize with this down-to-earth,cutting-through-the-verbiage approach.andP;  Yet, on deeper reflection, it ishardly satisfactory to seek such a vitaly, widely sought prize with this kindof subjective taxonomy.andM;Grudin reports the feeling among interface designers that it may be moreimportant to define the lack of consistency, but even this has defiedanalysis.andP;  Judging from complains, we all know a good interface inconsistencywhen we see one, but we do not always share the same pet peeves.andM;In our day-to-day computing we certainly encounter a multitude of situationwhere the many-to-many manping of actions to results can only be described asarbitrary and irregular.andP;  The most ironic of these is the simple act ofleaving some part of the system either temporarily or permanently.andM;One can appreciate the reason for the diverse coaxing initiation ceremoniesneeded to attract the target application's attention and get it fired up andrunning in the right direction.andP;  After all, you need to know (or elicit) thename, icon, or menu-level of the intended task, which is by no means atrivial interface design problem.andP;  But once running or completed, programsshould be able to offer a reasonably standard, predictable way out.andM;I defined the problem some years ago as follows:andM;exit v. intrans.andP;  To attempt to leave the current program by typing a seriesof ignored farewells.andP;  See also halting problem.andM;halting problem n.andP;  The problem of stopping a computation between crashes.andO;[2]andM;Some jealous routines, once invoked, seem determined to cling to you.andP;  Theycall for a variety of what our verbose industry might call &quot;exitationalmethodologies&quot; or &quot;strategies in the discontinuant environment.&quot;andP;  Within afew hours of serious pottering today, I used:andM;* / (ending a message on MCI)andM;* exit (leaving MCI)andM;* Quit (Crosstalk and Borland Sprint)andM;* bye (AlphaBASIC)andM;* Escape-Q (Alpha Vue)andM;* Control-C (AlphaMicro STAT command display et.andP;  al.)andM;* system (GWBasic)andM;* X (WordStar)andM;* Q (UNIX ed)andM;* A blank line (ending a message on the COMPUTER LANGUAGE BBS)andM;* G-Y (G for goodbye to the COMPUTER LANGUAGE BBS followed by a Y when itasks you &quot;Are you sure you want to leave y/n?&quot;)andM;* Logout (on the UNIX Review eponymous beast and basis network)andM;* Park/power-off on my 386 (the final parting of the session).andM;In passing, I cannot resist reporting that when you enter a message on theCOMPUTER LANGUAGE Wildcat BBS, the prompt for the name of your recipient saysTO: [C/R = ALL].andP;  I dub this the Wildcat democratic default, though I havenever dared to use it.andP;  I suspect it may be a trap, invoking some scathingresponse.andP;  It's useful for the sysop when sending global advice, I suppose,but the default saves only two keystrokes for a rare event.andM;If you compare Borland's Turbo C with Microsoft's Quick C, an interestingquirk arises from the desire to have unique first letters in each pull-downmenu.andP;  Borland uses Q for quit, but Microsoft breaks the rule by having X foreXit.andP;  E is already &quot;took&quot; by edit.andM;You will no doubt argue that my examples of inconsistency apply to differentregimesf surely the most we can expect is consistency within a givenproduct's interface.andP;  Well, I deliberately chose a set of actions common toall products, namely extrication, with a view to stimulating discussion oninterface standards.andP;  As is the nature of rabbits and standards, there's alot of them about--the smaller developer has to make the difficult choice asto which one(s) will emerge with sufficient market share to justify theinvestment plunge.andM;Standard interfaces such as the Mac, Windows, and OS/2 Presentation Managerencourage (or even demand) the provision of uniform user actions in starting,running, and ending jobs.andP;  Whether the huge overheads in RAM, MIPS, andprogrammer effort justify these interfaces is a much-debated issue; one that,by the time you read this, I will have addressed at the 1990 SoftwareDevelopment Conference.andP;  Slipping from the future-perfect (possiblyimperfectly) to the present-subjunctive, all may now be resolved!andM;In programs written for use outside one of the &quot;standard&quot; interfaces, Iwelcome those that offer profiles or config files, letting users set theirown personal choices of keystroke-action mappings (and other parameters, ofcourse).andP;  Moving from machine to machine has obvious drawbacks: one user'snewly gained consistencies may have created inconsistencies for others.andP;  Youcan reduce this problem by displaying the current defaults and keyboardallocations when a relevant section of the program is invoked.andP;  This is notalways easy without risking screen clutter and user distraction.andM;Another disadvantage, sometimes overlooked, concerns documentation.andP;  The usermanual must carry constant interpolations: &quot;Control-Y will erase a line(unless, of course, you have changed this using the MAPEDIT routine [seeAppendix M]....&quot;andM;Grudin's paper takes a fresh, heretical approach by stating, &quot;interfaceconsistency is a largely unworkable concept; the more closely one looks, theless substance one finds.&quot;andP;  He rightly points out that you can achieveconsistency by being consistently bad.andP;  (I wonder who he has in mind?)andP;  Hedetails three properties that attract the description &quot;consistent&quot;: internalconsistency within the interface; external consistency with other interfaces;and consistency between the interface and familiar, real-world features (thewell-known desktop metaphor, for instance).andP;  Grudin dampens the claim thatconsistency leads to ease of learning by showing that in many cases, ease oflearning conflicts head-on with ease of use.andP;  To sum up, unfairly, a long,well-reasoned paper, Grudin is arguing for more emphasis on the user's workenvironment and less on the tenuous shibboleth of &quot;consistency.&quot;andM;Throwing in my etymological penny's worth, the word under discussion comesfrom the Latin consistere, to stand still or firm, from which you may detectnegative overtones of stubbornessandM;In a formal system, consistency means that you cannot deduce a contradictionto any axion.andP;  Inconsistent formal systems turn out to be eminently boringsince they imply the truth of all propositions expressible in the system.andO;But as I warned you last month, applying formal logic to every aspect of ourtrade has its dangers.andP;  With user interfaces, consistency may be a biggerbore than our current spate of inconsistencies.andM;Further to my fire and theft vs.andP;  fire or theft anecdote in last month'scolumn: the Continental Casualty Co. does offer Boolean accidentcoverage--after the usual gruesome litany of &quot;the loss ('Loss' shall meanwith regard to thumb and index finger, actual severance through or above themetacarpophalangeal joints) of one hand and one foot, one hand and the entiresight of one eye or one foot and the entire sight of one eye&quot;
