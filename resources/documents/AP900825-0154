(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Harold Masursky, a pioneer spacescientist involved in the Mercury and Apollo programs and theViking experiments on Mars, died early Friday at his home. He was66.   Masursky had diabetes and his health had declined over the pastfew years. A cause of death was not immediately released.   Masursky retired in February after 43 years with the U.S.Geological Survey.

In the early 1970s, he was one of a small group of U.S.scientists who began a quiet exchange of space science informationwith the Soviet Union.   In 1976, Masursky helped select the landing site on Mars for theViking flight. He also helped set up Viking's experiments.   Masursky was a member of 41 scientific groups and received fourawards of excellence from the geological survey. In 1988, he wasawarded the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space MuseumAward for Achievement in Lunar and Planetary Exploration.
