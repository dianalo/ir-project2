Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democratactive in environmental issues, wrote EPA administrator William K. Reillycomplaining the move &quot;cannot help but create the impression that the EPA ismore sensitive to certain large corporations than it is to the desires ofmillions of American consumers.&quot;;    The EPA says a revised version of thehandbook, due out this fall at the earliest, will correct what it calls anumber of technical inaccuracies, including the listing of flypaper and somehousehold cleaners as hazardous substances.;    EPA spokeswoman MarjorieWeidenfeld Buckholtz said the withdrawal was not a result of pressure butbecause industry made some worthy points. &quot;We felt we have an obligation toprovide information that is absolutely factual. We were concerned ourcredibility would be negatively affected,&quot; she said.;    Weidenfeld Buckholtzsaid drafts of the agency's revised handbook will be run by industry andconsumer groups alike.;    In addition to a possible change in its hazardoussubstance list, the EPA is considering reworking the booklet's title toreflect a narrower focus on solid waste rather than general environmentalissues.;    The EPA's Office of Solid Waste, which published &quot;TheEnvironmental Consumer's Handbook&quot; last fall, said it was one of its mostrequested documents.;    About 15,000 copies, or half the original press run,were distributed. As for the other half, the spokeswoman said the EPA mayrecycle them or redistribute them with correction sheets.;    The critics,including Pallone and several environmental groups, fear the revision willrepresent a watered-down, less effective version of the original, which wasintended to help consumers cut down on trash.;    The original guide suggested&quot;safer substitutes for household hazards,&quot; including steel wool and bakingsoda to clean ovens, polishing furniture with a mixture of lemon and mineraloil, using natural soap flakes and vinegar to wash clothes, and shunninginsecticides in favor of natural repellents such as rosemary or eucalyptusseeds to treat your pet's flea or tick problems.;    The booklet promptedcomplaints from Procter andamp; Gamble Co., Scott Paper Co., Sweetheart Cup Co. andseveral of their industry trade groups.;    Some of the correspondence wasobtained by the Environmental Action Foundation, a Washington-based consumergroup. The Associated Press confirmed the contents of that correspondence withthe companies and industry groups.;    Procter andamp; Gamble, in a letter datedJan. 30 to the EPA, said it was concerned the booklet &quot;makes recommendationson disposable diapers which are based on incomplete data that considers onlyone aspect of environmental impact, rather than a total lifecycle analysis.&quot;;   The maker of Pampers, Tide and Mr. Clean and Top Job household cleaners alsowrote the handbook &quot;advocates that consumers adopt a 'mix your own' approachto products employed in many standard household tasks without regard for theattendant safety concerns.&quot;;    Scott Paper, in a letter dated Feb. 14 to EPA,said the booklet's recommended use of more durable goods over paper-baseddisposables fails to mention that U.S. forests have grown 20 percent over thelast 20 years and that 35 percent of the fiber used to make paper &quot;is residualwood chips from the lumber and plywood manufacturing process.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID E.
