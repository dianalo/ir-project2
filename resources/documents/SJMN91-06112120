She's captivelabor. &quot;The first thing (the parents) say is, 'Will you do the children'slaundry?' &quot; says Danette, a Los Altos nanny, recalling past experience. &quot;Andthe next thing they say is, 'Will you do ours?' &quot; Then they'll leave you thebreakfast dishes, and if they come home and the dishes are still in the sink,they'll wonder why you haven't done the dishes.&quot;;    Even the nanny's days offare not sacrosanct. &quot;If I'm not going anywhere, they (say), 'Can you watch thekids for a second? I need to go do something.' And she won't be back for twohours,&quot; says Debbie McManus, a Palo Alto nanny.;    2. NO RESPECT;    Theharshest view comes from English nannies, who are highly trained and respectedin their own country. In the United States, nannying &quot;is not treated like aproper job,&quot; says an English nanny working in San Francisco. A compatriotadds: &quot;The American family tends to want somebody who will do everything fornothing. The attitude is, 'We have a life and you have no life. You are thereat our beck and call and that's what we pay you for.' &quot;;    3. LOW PAY;   Linked to No Respect. The person who cleans your toilet makes $10 an hour. Alive-in nanny makes $5 to $7 an hour, a live-out $6 to $10.;    4. LACK OFAPPRECIATION;    &quot;Sometimes nannies will feel just like mothers,&quot; says ShawneMiller of I Love My Nanny, an agency in Los Gatos. &quot;They'll say, 'I cleaned upthe family room and nobody even noticed.' It hurts your feelings.&quot;;    5.LONELINESS;    Especially true in Silicon Valley. In Manhattan, nannies meetevery day in Central Park. Here, amid the urban sprawl, nannies are moreisolated with the children. &quot;Think about it,&quot; says a Los Altos Hills nannywe'll call Lisa. &quot;That's what women have been complaining about for ageneration: 'I've got to get out of the house and have an intelligentconversation.' &quot;;    6. DISCIPLINE CONFLICTS;    The nanny, like thetraditional wife, becomes the enforcer. The parents, like the old-fashionedhusband, are more indulgent. Two parenting systems evolve in the samehousehold. The children are angelic with the nanny -- until the parentsappear. Then they become &quot;totally different children,&quot; as Kim Slykhuis putsit. &quot;Megan's become a real pro at manipulation.. . . Usually she doesn't getan enforced 'no' that will really stick.&quot;;    Says Lisa: &quot;There are so manyparents who feel guilty and never say no. . . . One of my former employerstold me, 'Don't ever say no to my child.' I was like, 'You're weird. You'rereally bizarre.' &quot;;    Mothers say this is unfair. Children have deeper bondsand test limits more aggressively with parents. Nannies recognize this. Whatthey really can't stand is having their authority constantly undercut. AnEnglish nanny recalls: &quot;If I would say (to the child), 'You can't have anycookies before dinner,' she'd get them from her mother. . . . One time, wewere driving home from the store and the groceries were in the trunk, andthere were cookies in there. The girl was screaming for them. The mother said,'You can have one when you get home.' The girl was screaming, 'No, no, I wantone now!' The mother pulled over to the side of the road and got her thecookies. You want to say, 'Why did you do that?' But you can't say, 'You'redoing this wrong.' &quot;;    7. PARENTAL NEGLECT;    In troubled families, thenanny may become a surrogate parent. &quot;The higher the socioeconomic status, themore frustrating it is for the nanny because she's trying to replace both themother and the father,&quot; says Monica Frei of Mothers In Deed in Palo Alto. &quot;Andthe children are having emotional problems because they never get to see theirparents.&quot; Frei recalls one client, a wealthy divorced mother, whose sonsuddenly started wetting his bed and having nightmares. It fell to the nannyto take the child to the doctor. Diagnosis: The child wasn't seeing hisparents enough. The nanny then had to repeat this diagnosis to the mother. Thesituation was extremely awkward, and the nanny has since left the family.;   One hears many stories like this. The saddest part is that troubled familiesoften suffer rapid nanny turnover. Either the nanny quits or she's fired --and the children learn that nobody stays to take care of them.;    Nannies, ofcourse, can be as flawed as their employers. One mother recently called AuntAnn's Agency in San Francisco to announce that her Midwestern nanny wasleaving. It had been a mutual separation. &quot;She said, '(The nanny's) sociallife was just too extreme for us,' &quot; recalls T.C. Twohill of Aunt Ann's. &quot;Thenanny was forever heading into San Francisco on a Friday night at 10 o'clockand would call them at 3 a.m. from a Jack-in-the-Box because the car hadgotten towed. They paid $600 in a month getting this car (out of the pound).This lady definitely said, 'I don't want another Midwestern nanny.' &quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Kathy Holub  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910421  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  16  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  901  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday April 21, 199100112120,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
