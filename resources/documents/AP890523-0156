In London, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir dismissed as``useless'' U.S. calls on Israel to withdraw from the occupiedlands.   A pro-PLO newspaper in Jerusalem published a Palestinian appealto be presented at the Arab summit in Morocco urging Arab leadersto reject Israel's peace plan and demand that the United Statessupport creation of a Palestinian state.   In the occupied West Bank, the army clamped curfews on five WestBank villages, ordered all men between the ages of 15 and 40 out oftheir homes and made a number of arrests, the reports said.   Among those detained were five Palestinians from Al Mughayir,near Ramallah, who were suspected of killing a fellow villageraccused of collaborating with the Israeli authorities, according tothe reports.   In Kufr Sur near Tulkarem, residents reported they were orderedto paint over anti-Israeli slogans and remove Palestinian flags.They said tax agents accompanied the troops to collect back levies.   The national Itim news agency quoted West Bank commander Maj.Gen. Amram Mitzna as saying the army was using such raids toapprehend Palestinian activists in the West Bank and ``manifestcontrol of the area.''   Last week, the army arrested more than 250 Moselemfundamentalist Palestinian activists in th Gaza Strip.   Also Tuesday, Israeli troops shot and wounded elevenPalestinians during stone-throwing protests, Arab hospitalofficials said. One victim was a 70-year-old woman from a villagenear Nablus who was hit in the chest with a plastic bullet, thedoctors said.   The army confirmed the shooting in Nablus and said soldierswounded two other Palestians in separate incidents. An armyspokesman said they were investigating the other reports.   The Civil Administration in the West Bank destroyed sevenillegally built houses in villages near Hebron, and the armydeclared a curfew on the town of Jenin to prevent rioting after thedeath of a former mayor by an apparent heart attack, Israel radiosaid.   Throughout the occupied lands, Palestinans staged a generalstrike Tuesday declared by the PLO underground leaders to mark theArab summit. The strike was only partially observed in the GazaStrip, Israel radio reported.   The appeal to participants of the Arab League, which convenedTuesday, was published in the east pro-PLO Jerusalem daily Al Fajr,which described the document as the appeal from the ``state ofPalestine.''   The appeal urged Arab nations to support Palestinian peaceproposals, which call for Israeli withdrawal from the occupiedlands and an international peace conference to resolve theArab-Israeli conflict.   It also sought ``support for Palestinian opposition in rejectingthe Israeli government plan to hold elections under occupation''and ask the United States for ``clear recognition of Palestinianrights to self-determination.''   Shamir rejected a call by U.S. Secretary of State James A. BakerIII for Israel to stop building Jewish settlements on occupiedterritory and reportedly said his government's peace plan ruled outgiving up territory for peace.   ``The government's peace plan, which obligates everyone, rejectsthe formula,'' Israel radio quoted Shamir as telling Britishofficials in London. In his peace plan, Shamir had previously leftopen the issue of territorial compromise.   Shamir was asked about Baker's call for Israel to give up theidea of annexing the occupied lands, and he replied, ``I think itwas useless.''   Shamir insisted the details of his peace plan should not bediscussed until they can be negotiated with Palestinians.   The plan calls for electing Palestinians in the occupied landsto negotiate with Israel on a temporary self-rule plan, with talksto be held later on the final status of the territories.   Palestinians object because the proposal does not guarantee themindependence or an end to military rule.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel called Baker's call forland concessions ``explosive'' and said it threatened the coalitiongovernment of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc and the left-leaningLabor Party. Unlike Likud, Labor favors returning some territoryfor peace.   ``We can't say no (to Baker), because if we say no, we won'thave a (Palestinian) negotiating partner,'' said Liel. ``We can'tsay yes because if we say yes, we won't have a government.''   Several right-wing politicians accused Baker of trying todictate Israeli policies. But Haim Ramon, parliamentary leader ofthe Labor Party, praised the speech as good for U.S.-Israelirelations.   ``The prime minister and (Foreign Minister Moshe) Arens aretrying to sell some illusions to Israel that the U.S. is supportingthe Likud extreme policy and I think it's good that citizens willbe aware of the real U.S. policy,'' he said on Israel radio.   Palestinians in the occupied lands reacted favorably to Baker'scomments, but noted he still said the United States does not favorcreation of a Palestinian state.   ``It's a slap in the face of Shamir's plan,'' said Hathem AbuGhazale, a PLO supporter in the West Bank city of Nablus.   ``I believe Baker's statement is positive ... but it is not thechange the Palestinians are asking for,'' said Ziad Abu Ziad,editor of a pro-PLO weekly newspaper.</TEXT></DOC>
