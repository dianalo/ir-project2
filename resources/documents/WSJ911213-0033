Some large unitholders had opposed the proposal, arguingthat it was too generous to general partner T. Boone Pickensand didn't appropriately compensate preferred holders for the$1.875 a share, or $164 million, in accrued distributionsthat Mesa owed them.</LP><TEXT>   However, after an often-contentious meeting, Mesa saidthat holders of 50.9% of the company's preferred unitsoutstanding and 52% of its common units outstanding voted tomake the change. For the proposal to pass, it needed to beapproved by holders of at least half of the sharesoutstanding in each issue.   Under the proposal, common unitholders will receive oneshare of Mesa Inc. for each unit owned and preferred holderswill receive 1.35 Mesa Inc. shares for each of their units.Mesa plans a 1-for-5 reverse stock split after theconversion, which is expected to take place Dec. 31.   Mr. Pickens had proposed the change in hopes of attractingmore institutional investors and more attention from WallStreet, thus improving the stock price. However, someunitholders were angered that Mr. Pickens will receive asalary of $960,000 a year and new stock options with a lowerexercise price as part of the transaction.   Mr. Pickens, who hasn't received a general partner's feesince Mesa halted distributions in 1990, said that his salaryand stock options are up to the discretion of Mesa Inc.'sboard. But that didn't appease a few stockholders at Mesa'smeeting, who called on the board to bring in new management.   William Prickett, lawyer for a shareholder who ischallenging the Mesa transaction in Delaware chancery court,said he plans to count the votes to be sure that the tallywas accurate.</TEXT></DOC>
