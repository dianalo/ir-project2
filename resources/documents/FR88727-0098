Arenol Chemical Corporationtook exception to the application of Cambridge Isotope Laboratories forregistration as a bulk manufacturer of amphetamine, its salts, opticalisomers, and salts of its optical isomers and methamphetamine, its salts,isomers, and salts of its isomers. Arenol Chemical Corporation stated thatit has historically been able to meet the medical, scientific, and industrialneeds of the U.S. market for these products and is willing to work withCambridge Isotope Laboratories to supply the quantities that it may requireas Arenol has done with other organizations.Cambridge Isotope Laboratories manufactures a maximum of 5 grams of eachbasic class of controlled substances for which it is registered and usesthese substances to produce standards for research and analytical studies.The Deputy Assistant Administrator therefore finds that the registrationof Cambridge Isotope Laboratories as a bulk manufacturer of amphetamine,its salts, optical isomers, and salts of its optical isomers and methamphetamine,its salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers is consistent with the publicinterest because Cambridge Isotope Laboratories manufactures these controlledsubstances for research and analytical purposes in small quantities andthis activity does not affect the commercial market of these controlledsubstances.The Deputy Assistant Administrator hereby orders that the application submittedby Cambridge Isotope Laboratories for registration as a bulk manufacturerof the basic classes of controlled substances listed above be granted.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Gene R.
