(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Paula MusichandM;Fibronics International Inc. moved to fan the flames of interest in the FDDImarket last week with several new offerings designed to complement its baseof fiber-optic products.andM;The Hyannis, Mass., vendor unveiled six new options for its System Finex lineof products that adhere to the emerging Fiber Distributed Data Interface(FDDI) 100M-bps standard for fiber-optic networking.andM;The new offerings, based on Advanced Micro Devices' FDDI chip set, include:additional bridging and new routing capabilities between slower-standard LANsand FDDI backbone networks; a direct IBM mainframe link to the FDDI backbone;and options for boosting transfer rates and extending the distance betweentwo FDDI nodes.andM;Fibronics' new TCP/IP routing product, called the FX8310 FDDI IP Router, isdesigned to minimize the amount of traffic sent across an FDDI backbone, saidHal Spurney, director of marketing at Fibronics.andP;  The router allows IPpackets to be routed from Ethernet or Token-Ring subnetworks to devices onthe FDDI backbone or to other subnetworks connected through a router.andP;  TheFX8310 supports a data-transfer rate of 2,000 packets per second (pps), hesaid.andM;Additional protocols will be supported in a later Fibronics router, Spurneysaid, adding that DECnet protocol support &quot;would be a logical choice.&quot;andM;Fibronics users, such as the Coors Brewing Co., are eager to have DECnetrouting capabilities and the support for Novell Inc.'s IPX protocol, inaddition to the TCP/IP support.andM;&quot;Right now, we don't have a large population of TCP/IP users,&quot; said JohnAndrews, a network planner at the Golden, Colo., brewing company, which usescomputer and networking gear primarily from Digital Equipment Corp., IBM andNovell.andM;New options added to the existing FX8210 FDDI to LAN Bridge include supportfor dual Ethernet LAN connections and bridging capabilities between IBM 4M-and 16M-bps LANs and the FDDI 100M-bps backbone.andP;  The dual Ethernet links, aconfiguration option that Fibronics plans to extend to Token-Ringenvironments, cost the same as the existing single-link bridge.andM;Fibronics' first direct IBM mainframe FDDI interface, the FX8322 MainframeChannel Attached Network Controller, provides a high-speed link between thehost's block-mode channel multiplexer and the FDDI fiber backbone.andP;  It allowsdevices attached to the FDDI backbone via the router to access the IBM hostusing TCP/IP protocols.andM;The new high-performance option consists of hardware modules that roughlydouble the packet-transfer speeds of both the FX8210 LAN Bridge (from 10,000pps to 22,000 pps) and the FX8310 IP Router (from 1,200 pps to 2,000 pps),company officials said.andM;Fibronics' new laser-powered distance-extender option increases the maximumdistance between FDDI nodes from about 2 kilometers to 20 kilometers,officials said.andM;The FX8310 IP router has a base price of $19,000; the base price for theFX8210 bridge is $13,000.andP;  Ethernet connections for both devices cost $5,000each; Token-Ring links for both are $7,000 each.andP;  The FX8322 mainframeattachment is $35,000; the high-performance and distance-extender options are$5,000 each.andM;The new products are available 60 days after receipt of order, except for theToken-Ring links, which will be available by the end of the year.andM;Fibronics can be reached at (800) 456-3279.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
