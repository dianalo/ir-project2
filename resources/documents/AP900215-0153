Lewis, who analyzed the results of the survey.   Lewis, a professor of medicine, public health and nursing at theUniversity of California School of Medicine in Los Angeles, saidaround 17 percent of hospitals don't have policies to protectpatients' rights on the AIDS issue, and of those that do, ``adistressing proportion'' are inadequate.   Lewis declined to say how many are inadquate or discuss someother aspects of the study because his analysis of the data has notbeen published.   He and one of his co-workers on the survey, Howard E. Freeman,who has a doctorate in sociology and is a professor at UCLA,discussed some of their preliminary results at an AIDS conference.   The survey of 716 hospitals, about 14 percent of the nation'snon-federal, short-term general hospitals, was conducted betweenJanuary and August of last year by Louis Harris andamp; Associates of NewYork.   Lewis said about half the hospital administrators surveyed wereunaware of the guidelines put out by the federal Centers forDisease Control, which recommend that hospitals establish policies.The CDC guidelines also recommend that if hospitals test patientsfor HIV, they first get their consent.   Freeman said the survey found that about 15 percent of hospitalsdo not always inform patients they will be tested for the humanimmunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS, and a third donot always counsel a patient about the disease before they aretested.   About 4 percent of the hospitals surveyed don't always informpatients of HIV test results, and two-thirds of the facilities putthe results in the patient's file, he said.   In addition, about a quarter of the hospitals said theysometimes or always transfer to another hospital patientsidentified as being HIV positive, he said. Some hospitals say thereason for transfer is that they are not familiar with HIV and AIDStreatment procedures, and other say they are concerned abouttransmission of the virus to hospital workers.   Freeman said that while precautions must be taken to guardagainst hospital workers becoming infected through contact with aninfected patient's blood, the chances of transmission are small.   ``It has more to do with ... fright and fear of the virus,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
