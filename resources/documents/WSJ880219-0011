Freedman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AMB </CO><IN> TOB </IN><DATELINE> LEXINGTON, Miss.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A local district attorney is investigating the possibility that representatives of American Brands Inc. may have improperly contacted jurors in a major product-liabilty lawsuit that ended in a mistrial last month.    The investigation follows a request by plaintiffs' attorneys for a default judgment against the Old Greenwich, Conn., tobacco concern. In filing their motion in circuit court, the lawyers are claiming that persons hired by the company had improperly contacted jurors during the trial.    An American Brands official denied any impropriety. &quot;There was absolutely no tampering by American Brands with the Horton jury,&quot; said Robert Rukeyser, the company's vice president, operations.    The liability lawsuit was brought by survivors of Nathan Horton, a Lexington man who died of cancer after smoking Pall Mall cigarettes for 30 years. The closely watched trial was believed to be a plaintiff's best chance for winning a judgment against a tobacco company, but ended with the jury deadlocked seven to five.    The new development adds to the mystery surrounding the outcome of the two-week trial in this rural town. At the time, the judge refused to say which way the jury was leaning, though it is now believed they were favoring the company. He ordered jurors not to talk about the case afterward.    Now, several jurors say they have been contacted by investigators for both sides and asked to sign statements. One juror said a person who identified himself as an investigator for American Brands asked her about bribes.    The judge who presided over the trial, Gray Evans, has asked the district attorney to investigate the allegations surrounding the case.    Under investigation, according to District Attorney Frank Carlton, are three instances in which it is alleged that certain local residents hired by American Brands talked to the jurors during the trial. Mr. Carlton said the residents had apparently been recruited to help the company's defense team by collecting information about the jurors that would be helpful in determining how best to present its case. Mr. Carlton added that he doesn't know if the conversations were intended to influence the outcome of the trial. Any contact with a juror, however, he said, would have been improper.    An attorney for American Brands said the allegations were a publicity ploy by the plaintiffs. James Upshaw, the Greenwood, Miss.-attorney who represented American Brands in the trial, called the charges &quot;absolute junk,&quot; and added, &quot;It's a pathetic outrageous allegation by plaintiffs' counsel to get some publicity.&quot;    Mr. Upshaw accused the plaintiffs' attorneys of trying to generate publicity that would influence the pool of potential jurors for a retrial in the case.    The criminal investigation is legally separate from the plaintiff's request for a default judgment. The judge isn't likely to rule on the motion for default until after a hearing, legal observers said.    If the judge determines the conversations weren't meant to sway the jurors, the legal experts say, it is likely that his sanctions would fall short of a default judgment. He might order American Brands to pay the plaintiff's legal fees or simply fine those involved for contempt, they said.    The basis for the new dispute are four affidavits -- two of them from jurors -- collected by plaintiffs' attorneys and given to Judge Evans, according to Mr. Carlton.    The district attorney said the affidavits contain statements by the jurors that local residents hired to help American Brands' defense team called to tell them of a change in the scheduling of the trial. In another affidavit, a witness says a man who earlier had bragged he received $2,700 from the tobacco company was seen talking to a juror on the street. Mr. Carlton declined to identify any of the jurors or those who contacted them.    Mr. Upshaw said the allegations concern people who performed &quot;pretrial jury research&quot; for the defense. He declined to be more specific.    Apparently several jurors from the rural Mississippi area have been befuddled by investigators from one or both sides in recent days.    Lula Mae Simmons, one of the jurors, said a person who identified himself as an investigator from American Brands came to her home Tuesday with &quot;some questionnaire about the trial. He filled it out, and I signed it. It was nothing important to me. It was just an investigation about had there been any talk during the trial about had anyone gotten to me.&quot;    Another juror, Mrs. Thomas Gantt, said &quot;a man brought something for me to sign two days ago but I didn't sign.&quot; She said she didn't know what side the man represented. &quot;I didn't ask any questions because I wasn't supposed to,&quot; she said.    Yet another juror, Mildred Randall, said she was visited by a person who identified himself as an American Brands investigator and who asked her about bribes. &quot;They were investigating whether some jurors were paid off. I didn't know anything about it. They asked me who was bribed but I didn't know,&quot; she said.    These developments come in the aftermath of widespread disappointment by foes of tobacco, who felt the Horton case had a good chance to become the first victory against a tobacco company in a product-liability action.    Under Mississippi's comparative fault tort law, the jury could have awarded damages if it had found that the tobacco company was even one percent responsible for Mr. Horton's death. Moreover, the trial was staged in a poor, rural county that many observers felt would be more sympathetic to their neighbors, the Hortons, than toward a big corporation.    ---   Jeffrey A.
