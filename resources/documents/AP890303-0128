The former pop star, however, denied Friday that he wants to seethe writer killed. He said he was ``totally abhorred'' by presspublicity and headlines such as, ``Kill Rushdie says Cat Stevens.''   Stevens, a Briton who took the name Yusuf Islam and founded anIslamic school in London when he became a Moslem in 1977, said hehad ``simply stated the Islamic ruling on the Rushdie affair'' whenhe was asked a question at Kingston Polytechnic, a college nearLondon, on Feb. 21.   He said in a statement issued in London that his only fault was``being honest.'' He also said the novel ``insults God and Hisprophets, including those prophets honored by Christians and Jews aswell as Moslems.''   Stations such as KZPS-FM in Dallas, WCXR-FM in Washington, D.C.,WEBE-FM in Westport, Conn., WBZY-AM in New Castle, Pa., and KLSX-FMin Los Angeles have dropped Cat Stevens records from theirprogramming.   In Detroit, WRIF-FM promoted a ``No Cat Stevens Weekend'' bycutting into his songs with explosions or the sound of someonepunching someone ``right after a very optimistic and non-violentline of dialogue,'' program director Marty Bender said Friday.   ``We're doing the `No Cat Stevens Weekend' to make a point aboutone human being advocating the death of another. ... This guycarries a lot of weight, a lot of people grew up listening to hisstuff,'' Bender said.   The tempest stems from Stevens' remarks to Moslem students inEngland last week in which he endorsed Khomeini's call to killRushdie for writing the novel that many Moslems consider blasphemous.   ``The Koran makes it clear: If someone defames the prophet, thenhe must die,'' the singer-turned-teacher told the students.   Stevens was a leading singer-songwriter of the 1970s, with suchhits as ``Moon Shadow,'' ``Peace Train'' and ``Wild World'' in 1971,``Morning Has Broken'' in 1972 and ``Another Saturday Night'' in1974.   But he abandoned his career and stage name years ago.   Stevens said Friday that it is the duty of every Moslem to putforward the Islamic viewpoint ``and that is what I did.''   ``My only crime was, I suppose, in being honest. I stood up andexpressed my belief and I am in no way apologizing for it,'' Stevenssaid in a statement.   Stevens' statement was headed in black type: ``Under Islamic Law,the ruling regarding blasphemy is quite clear; the person foundguilty of it must be put to death. Only under certain circumstancescan repentance be accepted.''   Stevens said Moslems in Britain must observe British laws, butmight have to become more involved in British politics if thegovernment would not comply with their demands for a ban onRushdie's novel.   Bender, who estimates WRIF only played Cat Stevens songs once ortwice a week, readily admits `we're just goofing around'' and hebelieves much of the fuss on the nation's airwaves has its roots inpromotion.   ``It's more ploy than politics,'' he said.   In Nashville, disc jockeys at WGFX-FM dropped the singer's worksand offered to swap their recordings for copies of ``SatanicVerses.''   Radio personality Tom Leykis of KFI-AM in Los Angeles askedpeople to bring in records to burn, only to have that denounced bycolleague Geoff Edwards, who was suspended Feb. 28 for refusing torun Leykis' promotions.   KFI publicist Mike Venema said a station announcement on theresolution of that conflict was pending. However, a bonfirescheduled for March 8 was canceled because the Fire Departmentrevoked a permit it had granted, Venema said.   Leykis said in a press release he would still destroy therecords, perhaps by steamroller, but as an alternative he was tryingto organize a celebrity concert protesting the death threat againstRushdie.   A spokesman for WCXR in the nation's capital emphasized that thestation pulled the records off the air Feb. 28 after seriousdiscussion of listeners' complaints that they felt uncomfortablehearing Cat Stevens.   ``We didn't do this to generate publicity or to scream our callletters out,'' said promotion director Mark Lapidus, calling theindefinite suspension of Cat Stevens airplay a response tolisteners' requests.</TEXT></DOC>
