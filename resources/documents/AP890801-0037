Col. William R. Higgins withthe ``execution'' today of another U.S. hostage unless Israel freesa Shiite Moslem cleric it abducted.   The new threat, made after kidnappers released a videotape theyclaimed showed Higgins dangling from a gallows on Monday, saidJoseph James Cicippio would be killed if the Moslem cleric was notfreed by 6 p.m. (11 a.m. EDT).   But Israel refused to release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, saying itwould swap him and other Shiite Moslem prisoners for three Israelisoldiers and other foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.   An Israeli army spokesman said Monday that Obeid had confessedto directing the Feb. 17, 1988, kidnapping of Higgins.   The cleric is a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, the pro-Iranianorganization believed to be an umbrella group for kidnappersholding Higgins and the 16 other Westerners missing in Lebanon.Eight of the 16 are Americans.   Higgins' reported hanging was clouded by doubt because ofprevious reports he may have been killed months ago. Nevertheless,the claim and the grisly videotape that accompanied it met withrevulsion worldwide.   President Bush, who in response cut short a two-day Western tripand met with top advisers in Washington, condemned the reportedkilling of the U.S. Marine and called on ``all parties'' holdinghostages in the Middle East to release them.   In a statement Monday night, he said he wanted to go beyondcomments he made after Israel seized Obeid on Friday in a raid intosouth Lebanon, when he said kidnappings were harmful to the MiddleEast peace process.   He said he was issuing an ``urgent call to all, all parties whohold hostages in the Middle East to release them forthwith, as ahumanitarian gesture, to begin to reverse the cycle of violence inthat region.''   Higgins' pro-Iranian captors, who call themselves theOrganization of the Oppressed on Earth, claimed they hanged himbecause Israel refused to release Obeid.   The group released a 30-second videotape of poor quality showinga man hanging from a gallows. There was no indication when it wasmade and no body was reported found.   Rope bound the bare feet and hands of the man purported to beHiggins, who commanded a group of U.N. truce observers in southLebanon when he was seized.   The group claiming to hold Cicippio, the Revolutionary JusticeOrganization, issued its threat to kill him in a note, handwrittenin Arabic and delivered to the newspaper An-Nahar with a photographof Cicippio smiling and waring a brown-and-pink wool sweater over ablue pullover.   Cicippio, 58, of Norristown, Pa., was acting comptroller at theAmerican University of Beirut when he was kidnapped on the campuson Sept. 12, 1986.   ``The organization announces its quick resolve to execute thedeath sentence against the American-Israeli spy Joseph Cicippio ifthe struggling sheik is not released by 6 p.m. Tuesday,'' thestatement said. ``Then the deadline will be set for the execution,which will be broadcast on all screens in the world.''   Revolutionary Justice did not mention Edward Austin Tracy, 58,of Burlington, Vt., another American hostage it claims to hold.Tracy disappeared in October 1986.   In Nicosia, Cyprus, an anonymous caller claiming to speak forOppressed on Earth telephoned The Associated Press and said thegroup would kill a British hostage, Anglican Church envoy TerryWaite, at 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT) today unless Obeid was released.   It could not be immediately verified if the caller was from theorganization, which had not made previous calls to the AP office inCyprus.   Today, another anonymous caller claiming to speak for Oppressedon Earth said in a call to a Beirut radio station that Waite wouldbe killed by midnight unless Israel frees Obeid.   There was no way to determine the authenticity of the threat,made to the Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation.   Lebanese police said they could not confirm the claimed Higginskilling.   A typewritten statement in Arabic said Higgins, 44, was hangedat 3 p.m. It and the tape were delivered to a Western news agencyin Beirut an hour later.   A Lebanese police spokesman said: ``It seems highly unlikelythat the captors were able to hang the man, take the film anddistribute it inside an hour.''   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said Obeid had confessed personalinvolvementin ``planning and guiding and aiding'' the abduction ofHiggins and had revealed the names of his captors.   Benjamin Netanyahu, deputy foreign minister, said Israel wouldnot release Obeid despite threats of more killings. ``They mustunderstand that we will not give in to the dictates of theirblackmail,'' he declared.   After Higgins' death claim was made, Senate Republican leaderBob Dole of Kansas criticized the abduction of Obeid: ``Perhaps alittle more responsibility on the part of the Israelis one of thesedays would be refreshing.''   White House officials avoided direct criticism of Israel, butpress secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: ``It is fair to say thatmany people do share the senator's concerns.'' He would notelaborate.   State Department officials, speaking privately, said they foundreports that the man in the videotape was Higgins to be credible,but could not say whether it was made Monday or earlier.   In Iran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said before thereported hanging that the threat to Higgins ``has nothing to dowith us,'' but added that Israe should be pressed to release Obeid.   ``We condemn any kind of kidnapping or death threat,'' he said.   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., led a 75-man observer team attachedto the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he wasabducted. Previous statements from his captors claimed he used theU.N. post as a cover for spying on Moslem guerrillas.   In a statement on Dec. 12, 1988, they said Higgins had beensentenced to death after making ``full confessions about hisespionage activities.''   Sources in the U.N. force have said they believe Higgins wasdead when that statement was issued. They said they had informationhe died of maltreatment after an escape attempt.   Waite, 50, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking the releaseof foreign hostages after leaving his west Beirut hotel tonegotiate with Islamic Jihad. He is believed held by Islamic Jihad,though no group has claimed responsibility.   American Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondentof The Associated Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is thelongest-held Western hostage in Lebanon. </TEXT></DOC>
