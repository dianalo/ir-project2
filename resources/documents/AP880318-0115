The move is designed to counter criticism from Congress over theU.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's refusal to extend theMay 4 deadline for submitting applications.   At a news conference, Attorney General Edwin Meese III said the60-day extension on submitting supporting information will give alleligible aliens ample opportunity to take advantage of the chanceto become legal U.S. residents. It would apply to applicationssubmitted between April 4 and May 4.   ``It is our hope that on May 4 every single person who iseligible for legalization will have applied,'' Meese told reportersat an immigration office in Arlington, Va.   But under the simplified filing policy announced by Meese andImmigration Commissioner Alan Nelson, applicants will not berequired to produce time-consuming supporting documentation ormedical information for at least 60 days.   Nelson said that applicants would be scheduled for an interviewafter July 5 and that at that time documentation would be required.   ``The application can be completed in less than 30 minutes,''Nelson said. ``Without the requirement of immediate documentation,there is no reason for any qualified applicant not to file by theMay 4 deadline.''   With six weeks to go, the amnesty program has received just over1 million applications and will fall short of its early estimate of2 million.   Legislation has been introduced in Congress to extend thedeadline for one more year.   INS officials oppose any extensions.   Under the program, illegal immigrants who have lived in theUnited States since Jan. 1, 1982, can be granted amnesty if theyprovide documentation supporting their claim of living here for thepast six years.   Meese and Nelson also announced another change in the programwhich would give private groups more time to locate aliens who areeligible for amnesty.   In the past, these private groups assisting the immigrationservice collected fees only after they had completed filling outforms for an applicant, a process that can take three hours orlonger.   Under the change, the groups will be given a referral fee foreach applicant after they have directed an alien to an INSlegalization office.</TEXT></DOC>
