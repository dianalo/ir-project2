Bush was getting all the perks.   The president said George P. ``plays ball and ... does stuff''that his younger sister, brother and cousins can't yet handle.   Actually, four of Bush's seven granddaughters are older than 3,including George P.'s 11-year-old sister Noelle and 7-year-old twincousins, Jenna and Barbara.   Unlike George P., they haven't spent the past two weeks campedout at the White House, flying with their grandfather to fish in theGrand Tetons or donning a tuxedo to attend a Kennedy Centerextravaganza.   Neither have Bush's three other grandsons, who are ages 5, 4 and3.   The question from Jessica Lee of USA Today about the handsometeen-ager Bush calls his ``pride and joy'' struck a nerve in whatwas otherwise an unflappable performance by the early-risingpresident.   Bush squeezed in the 9 a.m. EDT news conference on short noticebefore a ceremonial welcome for the visiting prime minister ofAustralia.   Bush was asked when it would be the girls' turn to go fishing or``on some of these kind of excursions where you're doing thebusiness of the nation, to prepare them to be president?''   The girls are ``a little young to go fishing in Jackson Hole ...and put up with Marlin Fitzwater and all these people,'' Bushreplied, referring to his staff.   ``I want them prepared for the real world. I'm serious,'' saidBush, adding that Noelle had ``a wonderful time'' on her last visitto the White House in April.   ``My affection for our oldest grandson is just that he's thereand he's ready and he plays ball and he does stuff,'' said Bush.``We're going to the Orioles game tomorrow, I think it is, but it isnot discriminatory. It is not discriminatory.''   Prematurely revealing plans to attend the Wednesday nightbaseball game in Baltimore's Memorial Stadium was one of the fewslips Bush made.   It was Bush's 16th formal news conference and his first in nearlythree weeks. The relaxed president held forth for almost 45 minutes,taking five ``last'' questions before finally heading out the door.   No, Bush said, he won't ask Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng toreturn the cowboy boots Bush gave him in February embossed with theAmerican flag.   ``And I hope he doesn't ask for his bicycles back either,'' saidthe president.   Bush made a speech Monday decrying spouse abuse and otherviolence against women. Asked if he intended to take that message to``macho'' groups such as the National Rifle Association, Bush shotback, ``Hey listen, I'm a member of the NRA. You're hurting myfeelings, as they say in China.''   He said the Soviets shouldn't be ``uptight'' about his upcomingvisit to Poland and Hungary, just as he didn't mind the raves SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev got on his tour of West Germany.   ``I feel comfortable about the wavelength we're on with theSoviet Union now,'' said Bush.   He cited small things that make him feel that way: the Sovietsdispatching a ship to help clean up the oil mess in Alaska, and Bushsending the Army's crack burn team to help victims of a pipelineexplosion in the Soviet Union.   Bush said he won't be rushed into an early summit with Gorbachevjust for appearances' sake.   ``I've been around this track long enough to know that you canalways whip out something to sign, a fishing agreement or somethingof this nature,'' he said.   But he added that if there was no major treaty in the offing,``Maybe we'll do it like this: say, `Hey, let's get together.'''   He was a little more demonstrative than he wanted to be whenasked about the Senate-passed child care bill that Bush disagreeswith.   ``I've got to be careful of these gestures, the way these _ RichLittle and these guys _ '' he said, referring to comics who have hada field day with both the Bush syntax and body language.   Bush dodged _ or tried to _ only one question, when asked aboutCincinnati Reds' manager Pete Rose and his betting case.   ``Baseball, the national pastime, has sound rules regardingbetting on baseball games and I simply am ... not going to get intothat one,'' said the president.</TEXT></DOC>
