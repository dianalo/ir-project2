The cross sections for Ti/sup 2+/ and Ar/sup2+/ are compared with previously measured cross sections and with thosegiven by the semi-empirical formula of previous workers. The cross sectionfor Ti/sup +/ has not been measured previously and is compared with thosereported for the scaled plane-wave Born approximation.</TEXT></DOC>
