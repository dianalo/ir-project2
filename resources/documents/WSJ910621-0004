The list of well-heeled recipients of low-interest loansfrom the Rural Electrification Administration's telephoneloan program was topped by Prairie Telephone Co., which had$6.8 million in cash in 1989 -- more than six times the totalvalue of all its telephone equipment, buildings and lines incentral Illinois. Prairie, a Rochester Telephone Corp. unit,has only one employee, a telephone lineman, and 858customers, according to the REA.</LP><TEXT>   The agency had been asked by Rep. Glenn English (D.,Okla.) to identify REA borrowers that have accumulated&quot;excessive&quot; amounts of cash following a May 23 article in TheWall Street Journal that showed how Congress in 1985 forbidthe REA from differentiating between rich and poor borrowers.As a result, borrowing by large telephone holding companiessurged to $183 million last year from just $21 million in1987.   At a hearing yesterday, Rep. English, chairman of theHouse Agriculture subcommittee on conservation, credit andrural development, declared a readiness to take &quot;correctiveaction&quot; if excessive funds aren't being used to reduce phonerates, repay loans, spur rural development or improve orexpand phone service.   REA Administrator Gary Byrne, while declining to definethe term &quot;excessive,&quot; said the rural telephone industry as awhole has fared well in recent years while borrowing from thegovernment, usually at a 5% annual interest rate. At the endof 1989, the REA roster of about 1,000 borrowers had a totalof $1.6 billion in cash on hand after paying $1.2 billion individends. That compares with cash reserves of only $800million in 1984, he said.   The increase in capital would have been enough for theindustry to finance all its construction costs out of its ownpocket since 1984. Mr. Byrne told lawmakers.   A REA computer printout listed 109 phone companies andcustomer-owned cooperatives whose cash reserves andinvestments in other companies exceeded 50% of their totalplant value, including switching equipment, poles and lines,in 1989. One Wisconsin borrower, ranked 109th, had a physicalplant valued at $1,455,050, cash reserves of $729,886 and noinvestments in other companies.   Prairie Telephone led the 1989 list after selling itsstake in a cellular telephone partnership for $6,791,000. In1990, the company reported cash reserves of only $79,886,having paid $2,569,000 in taxes on the cellular sale andgiven its parent, Rochester Telephone, $4,981,000 to investunder a cash-management program, according to DwightZimmerman, president of Prairie and three other RochesterTelephone units based in Champaign, Ill. He said Prairiehasn't borrowed from the REA since 1970 and plans to installdigital switches with its own funds.   Ranked No. 2 was Templeton Telephone Co., an even smallersystem based in Templeton, Iowa. It accumulated $906,868 incash-nearly triple the $314,041 value of its physical plantin 1989. None of the 109 wealthiest could match Norman CountyTelephone Co., Ada, Minn., for investment in other companies.In 1986, Norman -- now known as Loretel Systems Inc.-- boughta neighboring phone company and three years later valued itsinvestment at $8,920,000-$234,000 more than the value of itsown physical plant. In addition, Norman had $600,000 in cash.   At the hearing, Mr. Byrne said that the administrationplans to ask Congress to remove the 1985 restriction againstusing so-called general-funds criteria in parceling outlimited loan funds.</TEXT></DOC>
