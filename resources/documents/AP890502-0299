The strategy could cost the long-distance giant millions ofdollars while giving union business to a non-union company.   The labor federation's governing body approved the plan, whichasks the 14 million members of the AFL-CIO and its affiliatedunions to route their long-distance calls via non-union US SprintCommunications Co.   ``You have a choice between a struck company and a non-unioncompany,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland told reporters after thefirst day of the federation's spring meeting.   ``If you want to make a telephone call, those are yourchoices,'' Kirkland said. ``Under those circumstances, you take thelesser of two evils.''   By placing calls through Sprint's five-digit access number, theunions and their members could boycott American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. without permanently changing long-distance carriersand could easily begin using ATandamp;T again after the end of a workstoppage.   Some larger AFL-CIO unions pay as much as $1 million a month inATandamp;T bills; labor's total bills amount to at least $100 millionannually, federation officials said.   The boycott plan was drafted by the Communications Workers ofAmerica and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.   Those unions are negotiating with the ATandamp;T but have made littleprogress toward resolving substantial differences over wages andhealth care.   Officials of both unions say their talks, which opened the lastweek of March, snagged immediately over an ATandamp;T proposal to shifthealth care costs to workers by making employees pay 20 percent ofmedical bills and by placing caps on lifetime and retiree benefits.ATandamp;T says its current health care plan, which fully pays medicalexpenses, costs $1 billion a year.   The unions say they also expect major differences with thecompany on wages but haven't goten to that because of the healthcare debate.   Contracts for 175,000 union members expire May 27. Long-distancecharges are ATandamp;T's largest income source.   CWA spokeswoman Francine Zucker said both unions, in the eventof a boycott, would recommend that unions and the members use USSprint because GTE owns part of US Sprint and workers at GTE-ownedregional phone companies are represented by unions.   She said no workers at other long-distance carriers arerepresented by unions or have any link to a union-representedcompany.   ATandamp;T officials have criticized the plan, saying the unions couldhurt their members by sending business to competitors.   But the unions have said they need such options to mount aneffective strike because technology would allow ATandamp;T to continuelong-distance service even if both unions walked off the job.</TEXT></DOC>
