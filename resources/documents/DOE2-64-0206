Theplots, however, were installed in the late sixties. We regard the conditionof the ecosystem under investigation in 1983 as the result of the influencesof the physical climate, the management, the soil conditions includingwater supply and of the chemical climate (concentrations of gases andparticulate matter, depositions). Therefore we investigated the potentialload of our plots in the past with sulphur dioxide, suspended particulatematter, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and ozone using data provided by literatureand by own measurements. There is a definite risk for very sensitiveplants to be affected by SO/sub 2/. This will be diminished only, whenin addition to the present emission situation in South East Lower Saxonythe intensity and the frequency of 'imported' London type smog episodesare reduced. The N inputs exceed the generally accepted critical loadsfor forests and heath ecosystems by far.</TEXT></DOC>
