SEC Chairman David S. Ruder urged Friday that the 12-nation Common Market adopt uniform laws against insider trading as well as coordinate their enforcement techniques as the group moves toward becoming a single market for goods and financial trading in 1992.    &quot;We are in some sense anxious to be sure that the regulation in the European Community reaches levels which are satisfactory to us,&quot; Mr. Ruder said at a news conference in Stockholm.    In contrast to the situation in Britain and France, insider trading isn't against the law in West Germany, which relies on a system of self-regulation by the securities industry.    West Germany's major banks, which control much of the nation's securities industry and hold many seats on West German stock exchange boards, defend the tradition of self-regulation based on a voluntary honor code.    West German banks, businesses and their employees are asked to sign a pledge that they won't use privileged information to enhance income from securities trading. Proponents of the system say the moral deterrent and risk of professional expulsion do more to discourage insider trading in West Germany than criminal laws would do.    &quot;We know the American position and those of other countries, but we believe voluntary agreements that are binding from the moral point of view are much more flexible,&quot; said Ruediger von Rosen, executive chairman of the Association of German Stock Exchanges. &quot;Our voluntary agreements reach at least as far as the strict and completely bureaucratic laws in the U.S.&quot;    Mr. von Rosen said he expects this to be a major topic during Mr. Ruder's planned visit to West Germany for talks with bankers and stock exchange officials. But the industry's position is supported by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government and the parties of his center-right coalition.    The finance committee of the Bundestag, West Germany's Parliament, voted this year not to initiate legislation on the subject, and the West German Finance Ministry says it isn't considering any amendments to West German securities laws. </TEXT></DOC>
