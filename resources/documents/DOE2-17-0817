Describes geologic structure and types of rocks occurringin the Upper-Silesian coal basin. Spoil banks were investigated and rocksamples taken in order to determine their petrographic characteristics.Analyses of materials taken from 17 mines indicate that mudstone andclayey shale prevail in the waste. Petrographic data on mine waste materialare presented in 10 tables. It is maintained that mine waste materialcould be used for river embankments. In draw areas, 420 km of river embankmentsshould be constructed by the year 2000 requiring 33 million m{sup 3}of material. The possibility of filling subsidence troughs with minewaste material instead of building drainage systems is also discussed.13 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
