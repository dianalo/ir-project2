Single electron calculationsare made for an undulator with first harmonic radiation tunable between3.5 and 13 keV. Using the universal curves developed by Kincaid (1985),the effects of randomly distributed field errors on the first and thirdharmonics of two proposed typical undulators are calculated. It is foundthat a lower limit of 0.5% on field errors is more than sufficient forthe successful operation of the undulators planned for the APS.</TEXT></DOC>
