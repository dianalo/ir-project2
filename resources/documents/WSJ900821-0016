Sometimes the biggest problem is finding the right radiofrequency to reach vessels in the busy shipping lanes. Whencontact is made, some captains change course to steer awayfrom the warship but don't indicate their destination.</LP><TEXT>   At other times, Capt. Morris Foote has to worry aboutsmall coastal freighters that he says stay in Egypt'sterritorial waters and may try to work their way into theJordanian port of Aqaba, a potentially large hole in theinternational interdiction net against Iraq. U.S. shipscloser to Aqaba and other ports have the final responsibilityof determining whether Iraqi cargo is involved, and the U.S.would intercept ships only in international waters.   But as tensions heat up in the Middle East, Capt. Footeand his crew know they will find it even more difficult tocontrol shipments to Iraq and protect the U.S. fleet in theRed Sea. &quot;There have been a few cases where we hailed a shipand got no response,&quot; Lt. Cmdr. Steve Miller, theTiconderoga's executive officer, said a few days ago. &quot;Butyou don't know if it's a {radio} frequency problem orsomething much more serious.&quot;   The volatility became clear over the weekend, whenAmerican warships fired warning shots at two Iraqi vesselsbelieved to be carrying outbound cargoes of oil.   &quot;When we start getting into the business of firing warningshots, you're never sure of the reaction,&quot; Capt. Foote toldreporters.   In many ways, life aboard &quot;The Tico&quot; -- as the crewaffectionately calls this 10,000-ton cruiser -- reveals therisks and difficulties of the Navy's massive show of force.The Ticonderoga's sophisticated radars, which cansimultaneously track large numbers of ships and planes formore than 250 miles, also serve as the primary air-defensewarning for the carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and itssupport ships.   &quot;I'm ready at a moment's notice to fire a warning shot ifI have to,&quot; Capt. Foote told reporters who visited his shiplast weekend. If a hostile plane heads directly for theTiconderoga, he said, &quot;I could have guns shooting in 10seconds . . . and have missiles shooting in less than that.&quot;   &quot;The crew understand this is serious business, and theyknow the president isn't joking,&quot; Capt. Foote said. &quot;They allhave cars. They have motorcycles. I don't think any of themfail to see the importance of fuel.&quot;   All crew members have been issued gas masks and protectiveclothing in the event chemical weapons are used by theIraqis.   Inside the hushed, air-conditioned core of the ship --called the combat information center -- the pale green lightfrom computer consoles and a giant, computer-generated map ofthe region reflects off Capt. Foote's face. He presses abutton, and the image pans out to show the precise speed andlocation of distant ships that won't reach the carrier taskforce for days. Little half-moons identify the position of 50or so planes that the ship's computers monitor every hour.   In the blinding sunlight on deck, a few nervous sailorswith flak jackets, M-14 rifles slung over their shoulders and.45-caliber pistols on their hips stand ready to make good onthe U.S. blockade. &quot;We just call ourselves thevisit-and-search party,&quot; said the 27-year-old lieutenant incharge. (Defense Department rules allow identifying onlysenior officers.)   If a ship is suspected of carrying Iraqi goods, thesesailors would take a small boat to board it and inspect thecargo. &quot;Every ship in the fleet has been asked to puttogether such teams,&quot; said the native of Owings Mills, Md.Ship captains are required to consult closely with seniorofficers before taking such hostile action.   Most of all, Capt. Foote worries about the long-termimpact on his crew's nerves. &quot;It's very hard to be onfive-minute alert for six months,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
