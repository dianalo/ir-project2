The new regulations are designed to recognize the differencesbetween the OCS activities associated with the discovery, development,and production of oil, gas, and sulphur and similar activities associatedwith OCS minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur. These regulations addressissues identified by MMS as well as issues raised by representatives ofindustry (potential OCS mineral lessees), other Federal Agencies, Stateand local governments, and the public. To accomplish this goal, it wasfelt that the new regulatory regime should be designed to do the following:(1) Recognize the special circumstances, issues, and requirements associatedwith the discovery, delineation, development, and production of OCS mineralsother than oil, gas, and sulphur; (2) Assure that States, and through States local governments, which aredirectly affected by OCS mineral exploration and mining activities, areprovided an opportunity for consultation and coordination on policy andplanning decisions relating to the management of OCS resources; (3) Avoid or minimize conflicts between OCS mineral exploration and miningactivities and other users and uses of OCS resources; (4) Balance orderly mineral resource development with protection of thehuman, marine, and coastal environments; (5) Insure the public a fair and equitable return on the OCS resources;(6) Preserve and maintain free enterprise competition; (7) Encourage development of new and improved technology for producingOCS mineral resources other than oil, gas, and sulphur which will avoidor minimize risk of damage to the human, marine, and coastal environments;and (8) Establish practices and procedures for postlease mineral activitiesand wise management of the natural resources of the OCS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This rule is designed to govern postlease activities to discover,delineate, develop, produce, and process OCS minerals other than oil, gas,and sulphur. On April 9, 1986, MMS published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(ANPR) for regulations to govern postlease operations (51 FR 12163) associatedwith OCS mineral leases for minerals other than oil, gas, or sulphur. Commentsand recommendations received in response to the ANPR for postlease operationswere summarized in the Public Comments and Agency Responses portion ofthe Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) that was published on August 18,1988 (53 FR 31442), to propose rules to govern Operations in the OuterContinental Shelf for Minerals Other Than Oil, Gas, and Sulphur. On October 3, 1988, a Notice was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 38739) which extended the comment periodon the proposed rule from October 3, to November 2, 1988. A total of 23comments and recommendations were received. Five of those requested thatthe comment period be extended beyond October 3, 1988. The 18 remainingresponses to the August 18, 1988, NPR were comprised of 7 comments andrecommendations from State agencies, 1 comment from industry, 4 commentsfrom environmental organizations, 2 comments from individuals, 2 commentsfrom other Federal Agencies, 1 comment from a U.S. Senator, and 1 commentfrom a group comprised of representatives of State governments, environmentalorganizations, and industry. A review and discussion of those commentswill be found in the section entitled Public Comments and Agency Responses.The first part of the regulatory regime to govern OCS mineral mining activitieswas published July 5, 1988 (53 FR 25242), effective August 4, 1988. Itestablished practices and procedures specific to prospecting activitiesassociated with geological and geophysical (Gandamp;G) exploration and scientificresearch for OCS minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur. The provisionsof 30 CFR Part 280 are also applicable to Gandamp;G exploration and scientificresearch conducted by a lessee on unleased lands and those conducted onleased OCS lands by a person who is not the operator or lessee. A finalrule designed to govern the leasing of such OCS minerals appears in anotherpart of this <T4>Federal Register.</T4> <ITAG tagnum="84">The DOI's Responsibilities </ITAG>This rule is an action within the statutory authority of the Secretaryof the Interior (Secretary) and is intended to promote and encourage privateenterprise in the development of an economically sound and stable domesticmaterials industry in the United States which provides the appropriatelevel of protection for the human, marine, and coastal environments. Section 8(k) of the OCSLA provides specific legal authority and responsibilityfor the leasing of minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur in the OCS.This authority and responsibility exercised in conjunction with 20 othersections of the OCSLA, which are applicable in whole or in part, and otherlaws provide the Secretary with adequate flexibility and guidelines toestablish and administer an OCS minerals leasing and mining program forminerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur. The DOI and MMS recognize the potential for adverse environmental impactsas a result of OCS mineral development activities. These potential impactswill be identified and appropriate mitigation measures determined as partof DOI's environmental review process. Under DOI's case-by-case approach,issues common to all forms of OCS mining activities associated with OCSminerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur will be covered by regulationsgoverning Gandamp;G prospecting and scientific research (30 CFR Part 280),leasing (30 CFR Part 281), and postlease operations (30 CFR Part 282).The lease sale planned for Norton Sound is an example of the way DOI carriesout its National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) responsibilities. On March11, 1988, MMS published a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EnvironmentalImpact Statement (EIS) in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 8134) in association with a Request forComments and Nominations for a Lease Sale in Norton Sound. Lease sale EIS'ssuch as the one being prepared for Norton Sound will be augmented by additionalenvironmental documentation prior to the approval of postlease developmentand production operations. Using this case-by-case approach, mitigation measures can be defined withspecificity as mineral resource targets are identified and recovery methodsare defined. Commodity-specific issues will be covered by specially designedlease stipulations specified at the time the targeted OCS minerals areoffered for lease. Site-specific issues identified after the issuance ofa lease will be addressed through conditions of approval of Delineation,Testing, or Mining Plans for the conduct of postlease operations. Basedon this approach and information obtained from lessees in support of proposedoperations and as a result of MMS's Environmental Studies Program, MMSbelieves that protection of the environment is compatible with the recoveryof minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur from the OCS. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>During the period of 1954 through 1988, seven lease offerings were completedfor salt, sulphur, and phosphate minerals using the regulations promulgatedunder the OCSLA (30 CFR Part 256).

Sand and gravel are being produced from Lake Erie and in Long IslandSound and New York Harbor in New York's and New Jersey's State waters.Interest has been expressed in acquiring prospecting permits for sand andgravel in Federal offshore waters. The MMS is working closely with nine coastal States through joint State/Federaltask forces and other arrangements to study the engineering, economic,and environmental aspects associated with the mining of OCS minerals otherthan oil, gas, and sulphur. These arrangements include a special workinggroup with Alaska and five task forces involving eight other coastal States:Hawaii; Oregon; Georgia; North Carolina; and Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi,and Texas. Minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur which may be discovered and producedfrom the OCS include over 80 different commodities, including a numberof strategic minerals with limited domestic availability. Although OCSminerals resource data are limited, estimated quantities of mineral associatedwith cobalt-rich manganese crusts would appreciably increase the U.S. reservebase for strategic materials such as cobalt, nickel, and manganese. Existingworld ore reserves of these minerals are adequate for the foreseeable future,but they are controlled by relatively few producer countries that couldpotentially exercise leverage over commodity prices. The OCS mineral deposits that have nearer term economic potential includeheavy mineral placers containing gold, chromium, platinum-group minerals,tin, and titanium, as well as sand and gravel for construction material.Phosphorite crusts and nodules, as well as extensive bedded deposits offthe U.S. east coast, are a potential future source of phosphate_now a majorU.S. mineral export and an essential mineral import to many world agriculturalregions. This rule establishes a broad regulatory framework; lease stipulationswill define site-, commodity-, and technology-specific requirements; andthe appropriate public and environmental review of leasing proposals andproposed postlease operations will facilitate the consultation and coordinationprocesses authorized under Federal law. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulation Organization </ITAG>This rule governs lessee conducted activities on a lease for minerals otherthan oil, gas, and sulphur in the OCS. The rule is subdivided into fivesubparts. A majority of the provisions fall under two subparts: SubpartB, Jurisdiction and Responsibilities of Director; and Subpart C, Obligationsand Responsibilities of Lessees. The remaining subparts are Subpart A,General; Subpart D, Payments; and Subpart E, Appeals. While many activitiesare governed by the provisions of a particular subpart, some activitiesare subject to provisions contained in more than one subpart. For example,suspensions of production or other operations are addressed in both SubpartsB and C, because they can either be directed by MMS or requested by a lessee.The provisions which govern lessee obligations and responsibilities foractivities to be carried out on a lease are contained in Subpart C. Lesseeconducted activities normally fall into one or more of three basis categories:exploration, testing, or mining and processing. These lessee conductedactivities must be conducted in accordance with an approved plan. No activitymay be conducted that is not included in the activities described and approvedas part of an approved plan. An exception is made for preliminary activities,i.e., those activities which have no significant environmental impact andwhich are necessary to prepare a reasonable Delineation, Testing, or MiningPlan. Requirements for the safe conduct of mining activities and environmentalprotection and monitoring are also in Subpart C. To aid the lessee, reportingand recordkeeping requirements other than those associated with Delineation,Testing, and Mining Plans are given in andSection; 282.29. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments and Agency Responses </ITAG>Comments and recommendations received in response to the August 18, 1988,NPR (53 FR 31442) are discussed below in relation to the provisions ofthe final rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart A_General </ITAG>Section 282.1 Purpose and authority. <T3>Comment: </T3>Ten commenters asserted that the OCSLA was an inappropriateand inadequate vehicle for marine mining and recommended that DOI requestnew stand-alone legislation. Various concerns were expressed including:(1) The OCSLA was written for oil and gas and never intended to governmarine mining, (2) the OCSLA does not adequately balance national and Stateinterests and provides for little State involvement both in the decisionmakingprocess and revenue sharing, (3) the OCSLA gives the Secretary too muchdiscretion in formulating a program to govern OCS mining, and (4) the requirementfor a competitive cash bonus bid is a disincentive. The majority of thesecommenters suggested that DOI desist from further promulgation of rulesunder the OCSLA and pursue new legislation. <T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion to defer promulgation of rules in favorof new stand alone legislation was not adopted. The OCSLA expressly entendsDOI's jurisdiction and responsibility to OCS minerals other than oil, gas,and sulphur. The responsible course of action for DOI is to tailor implementingregulations in the best fashion available under the law to meet the requirementsof marine mining. The OCSLA provides a clear legal basis for the promulgationof regulations to govern marine mining. Sections 5 and 8(k) of the OCSLAin combination with the 19 other sections of the OCSLA, which are applicablein whole or in part to minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur, clearlyand specifically grant authority to the Secretary to prescribe terms andconditions appropriate to the regulation of marine mining, including preleaseprospecting, leasing, and postlease operations. Used in conjunction withother applicable OCSLA provisions and other laws, there is substantialand sufficient authority for ensuring adequate balance of national andState interests. It is true that there is no provision for revenue sharingwith adjacent coastal States, but such a provision, with a limited recentexception, is also not available for oil, gas, and sulphur. Proposals forrevenue sharing have been opposed by the last several administrations.Recognizing that there are differences btween oil and gas and other minerals,the OCSLA provides the Secretary with the necessary flexibility for theadministration of a responsible OCS mining program. There is clear valuein the establishment of a separate regulatory regime for OCS minerals otherthan oil, gas, and sulphur. While lease sales could be held and, in fact,have been held under existing regulations, mining company representativeshave expressed a desire for regulations which would permit them to moreaccurately predict the economics of projected operations. Greater regulatorycertainty will facilitate the raising of necessary venture capital. <T3>Comment: </T3>Seven commenters pointed out that the OCSLA does notgrant jurisdiction to DOI over offshore areas which are adjacent to theU.S. territories and possessions. <T3>Response: </T3>The DOI recognizes that the OCSLA does not provide jurisdictionover offshore areas adjacent to lands over which the United States exercisesjurisdiction and control but which are not States (e.g., Johnston Island).Jurisdiction over those areas is not essential to the establishment ofa leasing or regulatory program and is not relevant to the promulgationof this rule. Section 282.3 Definitions. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter noted that there were inconsistencies betweenthe definitions of ``Adjacent States'', ``Minerals,'' and ``Person'' asproposed in andSection;andSection; 282.3 and 281.3. <T3>Response: </T3>The definitions of two of these terms have been modifiedin the final rule to address this concern. The definition of ``AdjacentState'' has been modified by the addition of the word ``proposed,'' between``activity'' and ``conducted.'' The definition of ``Minerals'' was revisedto track the language of section 2(q) of the OCSLA. The definition of OCSminerals has been expanded to cite the reservation of source materialsessential to production of fissionable materials pursuant to section 12(e)of the Act. The definition of ``Person'' is unchanged from the definitioncontained in the proposed rule. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that the definition of ``development''be reworded by replacing the word ``operation'' with ``construction'' andthat the word ``and'' between ``facilitates'' and ``which'' be deleted.<T3>Response: </T3>The definition of development has been modified in thefinal rule by the addition of the phrase ``construction of offshore facilities''between ``drilling,'' and ``and operations'' and by deletion of the word``and'' from between ``facilities'' and ``which.'' <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the definition for ``Governor''be replaced with the statutory definition in both the leasing and operatingregulations. <T3>Response: </T3>The statutory definition of ``Governor'' has been adoptedfor this rule. Some additional changes were made to the text of andSection; 282.3 to clarifythe meaning of certain terms. The last phrase in the definition of ``Exploration''was modified to read ``proceed with development and production.'' The word``person'' was substituted for the word ``party'' in the first line ofthe definition of ``Lessee.'' The phrase ``(when obtained for geochemicalanalysis)'' was inserted in the definition of ``Geological sample'' betweenthe words ``waters'' and ``acquired.'' The definition of ``Production''was deleted as redundant. Sections 282.5. 282.6, 282.7, and 282.8 of the proposed rule have beenrenumbered andSection;andSection;282.4, 282.5, 282.6, and 282.7, respectively.This change corrects the inadvertent omission of a andSection;282.4 in theproposed rule. Section 282.4 (proposed andSection;282.5) Opportunities for review and comment.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters noted that there is only general mentionof joint State/Federal task force involvement in the review and evaluationof postlease activities and the environmental protection measures thatwill be required of lessees. It was recommended that the final rule describethe composition, responsibilities, and duties of joint State/Federal taskforces. The commenters wanted to strengthen the role of task forces inthe MMS decisionmaking process and in postlease monitoring of impacts andenvironmental protection.<T3>Response: </T3>The provisions in the final rule relating to task forcesand other such joint State/Federal coordination arrangements are purposefullygeneral in order that those arrangements can better serve as a vehiclefor the cooperative enforcement of safety, environmental, and conservationlaws and regulations (43 U.S.C. 1334(a) and 1345(e)). Provisions in theregulations should not be overly restrictive or prescriptive. They shouldprovide sufficient flexibility to permit structuring of the working arrangementsto best suit the specific situation, authority, and jurisdiction involved.The MMS intends to continue to work very closely with adjacent States andother Federal Agencies to determine composition and scope of individualtask forces on a case-by-case basis. Representatives, including those fromother Federal Agencies, will be invited to participate as their interestsand capabilities dictate. The MMS anticipates establishing State/Federalworking arrangements early in the process prior to initiation of environmentalreviews leading to publication of a lease sale notice. It anticipates thatthose State/Federal working arrangements will be designed to continue tofunction through postlease activity. The membership and role of a taskforce may change as circumstances change and development activities proceed.While there is no requirement that State/Federal task forces or other workingarrangements discharge monitoring or inspection functions for MMS, MMSis open to considering this role on a case-by-case basis. Although it isanticipated that MMS decisions will give great weight to task force recommendations,the rule does not require decisions to ``conform'' to those recommendations.The MMS does not believe that the Secretary_or the Governor of an adjoiningState for that matter_should, or can, relinquish basic authorities andresponsibilities vested by law. On the other hand, State/Federal task forcesare excellent forums for reaching timely consensus on issues, facilitatingcommunications, and coordinating Federal and State regulatory activities.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters requested that Governors be providedat least 90 days to review and to provide comments and recommendationsto the Director on proposed Delineation, Testing, and Mining Plans. Somealso requested that the Secretary's criteria for balancing various factorsbe defined. Two commenters asked that the regulations be revised to includespecific requirements to provide for public review and comment on proposedactivities (e.g., a Notice of Availability of Proposed Delineation, Testing,or Mining Plans should be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>).<T3>Response: </T3>The timeframes for reviewing, commenting on, and providingrecommendations concerning lessee submitted Delineation, Testing, and MiningPlans have not been changed. The specified comment periods track the timeframesmandated by the OCSLA in section 11 for Exploration Plans and sections19 and 25 for Development and Production Plans. Although Exploration Plansand Development and Production Plans apply to activities associated withOCS oil and gas operations, the review process involved is similar to thereview process being established for OCS minerals other than oil, gas,and sulphur. In the event the activities described in a proposed Delineation,Testing, or Mining Plan are of a nature which requires the developmentof an EIS, the final rule authorizes the Director to allow the Governoradditional time for the submission of comments and recommendations.A set of ``defined'' criteria has not been included in the final rule.The example of criteria cited by commenters (i.e., criteria establishedby the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the NEPA and by theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the Deep SeabedHard Minerals Resource Act) was reviewed and found to be too narrow inscope to properly reflect the ``balancing'' which the Secretary is requiredto perform in arriving at a given decision in a specific case. Any listof criteria which might be appropriate for a given case at a specific timemay not be appropriate for use in reaching a balanced decision in thatcase at another time or in another case at any time. It is sufficient thatthe Secretary provides an explanation regarding a decision not to adopta written recommendation submitted by the Governor of an adjacent State.Preparation of environmental assessments for activities governed by planswill also provide public notice and involvement. There will be severalopportunities for the interested public to participate in the review of,and comment on, proposed mining activities. Insofar as NEPA analysis isrequired for proposed activities covered in Delineation, Testing, or MiningPlans, Notices of Intent to prepare EIS's and Notices of Availability ofEIS's will be published in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The scoping process allows, too, for publicinvolvement. Members of the public may also arrange with the Director (appropriateMMS Regional Director) to be notified of the receipt of lessee submittedproposals and to be provided access to the nonproprietary portions of thoseproposals. All comments that are received in a timely manner will be takeninto consideration during the decisionmaking process.<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of commenters recommended that the role of theState/Federal ``task forces'' should be more specifically defined in theregulations and that the ``task forces'' should review proposed activityplans, contingency plans, and changes to approved plans.<T3>Response: </T3>The recommendation that the role and responsibilitiesof task forces be specified by regulation has not been adopted. However,to the extent that involved States are interested, it is anticipated thatjoint State/Federal task forces or other working arrangements will be developedat any point in the process prior to leasing or afterwards. It is alsoexpected that those working arrangements would continue to function asa coordinating mechanism during the review and approval of the postleaseplans and activities governed by the regulations in Part 282. There isconsiderable advantage to allowing flexibility in the nature of those arrangementsso that they can be structured to facilitate cooperation and contributemost effectively to the unique set of conditions, concerns, and needs associatedwith a given mining operation and its environment.Section 282.5 (proposed andSection; 282.6) Disclosure of data and informationto the public.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed the view that all information(including proprietary data and information) relied upon to meet the minimumrequirements of applications for plan approval should be made availableto the public. Another commenter expressed the view that detailed provisionsfor the protection of proprietary data from disclosure are needed in ordernot to discourage industry investment.<T3>Response: </T3>The availability of Gandamp;G data to the public is governedby the Freedom of Information Act, the OCSLA, and implementing regulationsincluding those contained in andSection; 282.5. Section 282.5(b) has beenexpanded to more explicitly state the persons to whom the Director maymake early release of data and information for effective and efficientdevelopment of a deposit. Section 282.5(c) continues to permit the Directorto make geophysical data and information collected in compliance with alease stipulation or order concerning the protection of the environmentof the lease available to the public, unless the lessee shows to the satisfactionof the Director that release of the information or data would unduly damagethe lessee's competitive position.Section 282.6 (proposed andSection; 282.7) Disclosure of information to anadjacent State.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed the view that representativesof adjacent States should be provided access to all lessee submitted plans,data, information and samples.<T3>Response: </T3>This rule provides the representatives of adjacent Stateswith the maximum access permitted under the OCSLA. Certain proprietarydata and information can be accessed by State officials when the necessaryagreements to protect the data and information from unauthorized disclosurehave been signed.Section 282.7 (proposed andSection; 282.8) Jurisdictional controversies.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expresssed concern that the provisionsof andSection; 282.7 simply reiterate the provisions of section 7 of theOCSLA which governs the handling of jurisdictional controversies and thatneither andSection; 281.10 nor andSection; 282.8 anticipates or addresses asituation when the affected OCS mineral resource extends onto adjacentState lands.<T3>Response: </T3>The provisions of andSection; 282.7 concerning jurisdictioncontroversy remain unchanged. While the language of andSection; 282.7 tracksthe language of section 7 of the OCSLA, the provisions of that sectionshould not be interpreted as a means for initiating negotiations wherejurisdictional controversies are involved, i.e., litigation over the locationof the common boundary between Federal OCS lands and State submerged landsis concerned. The situation where an affected OCS mineral resource extendsonto adjacent State lands is best addressed by unitization of operationspursuant to andSection; 282.11(d). The fact that an orebody extends underState and Federal OCS lands does not in and of itself constitute a controversy.To address management of OCS mineral deposits which straddle State/Federaljurisdiction, DOI hopes to be able to develop an agreement with the adjacentState for joint management to the degree joint management is needed forthe enforcement of safety, environmental, and conservation laws and regulations(43 U.S.C. 1334(a)) and the protection of correlative rights. The agreementwould involve both the State and Federal lessees and assure coordinationand cooperation to the extent necessary to maximize efficiency, reducethe regulatory burden, and obtain an equitable return to all parties. Whena mineral deposit straddles the State/Federal boundary, the lessees typicallywill negotiate an appropriate agreement to cover mining operations on theleases and the allocation of costs and benefits to the owners of dividedinterests in the area embraced by the Federal and State leases that aremade subject to the unit agreement.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart B_Jurisdiction and Responsibilities of Director</ITAG>Section282.10 Jurisdiction and responsibilities of Director.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed the view that environmental protectionmeasures should be included in the list set forth in andSection; 282.10.<T3>Response: </T3>This suggestion has been adopted.Section 282.11 Director's authority.<T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter stated that the Director's authority andresponsibility under NEPA and OCSLA are to provide information needed forthe assessment and management of environmental impacts on the human, marine,and coastal environments. The commenter felt that the production of thisinformation base must be something on which industry and the States canrely and the result of a process in which they play an effective role.<T3>Response:</T3> The marine mining program and regulations provide significantopportunity for adjacent States, industry, and others to work directlywith MMS through joint State/Federal task forces and other arrangements.These arrangements play an important role in assuring an adequate informationbase for decisions. The MMS also generates a wealth of environmental dataand information through the environmental studies program. This data andinformation are applicable in large part to the marine mining program.It provides MMS with some of the best available scientific informationon which to base its decisions. The DOI has established the OCS AdvisoryBoard comprised of the OCS Policy Committee, OCS Scientific Committee,and Regional Technical Working Groups as an effective means for industry,States, and others to participate and influence the base of informationupon which decisions are made.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed the view that the applicant ofa project should be required under the provisions of these regulationsto pay for the environmental analysis of the project.<T3>Response:</T3> This suggestion has not been adopted. The lessee isrequired to submit environmental information regarding impacts of the activitiesproposed in a Delineation Plan, Testing Plan, or Mining Plan. When additionalinformation is needed, a lessee may be required to provide that informationin support of its proposal.Section 282.11(d)(1) has been modified by adding the phrase ``or the preventionof waste'' to the end of the first sentence. Prevention of waste is oneof the traditional bases for unitizing operations on two or more leases.Section 282.12 Director's responsibilities.<T3>Comments:</T3> Several commenters expressed the view that the criteriaon which the Director will disapprove a Testing Plan or Mining Plan shouldbe specified in the rule. The view was that the criteria contained in theproposed rule are too vague and ill defined, and the environmental protectionprovisions are inadequate. It was felt that the final rule should includea list of very specific criteria to be considered during the review processfor approval or disapproval of a Testing Plan or Mining Plan.<T3>Response:</T3> Additional specific criteria have not been incorporatedin the final rule. The criteria to be used by the Director in the reviewand approval/disapproval for a Testing Plan or Mining Plan remain unchangedfrom those cited in andSection; 282.12 of the proposed rule. The Director'sreview and assessment of the technical and environmental aspects of a TestingPlan or Mining Plan will take a balanced approach using recognized guidelinesfor protecting the environment. These guidelines come from a wide varietyof laws besides the OCSLA and NEPA. These laws include the Endangered SpeciesAct, Marine Mammals Protection Act, National Historic Preservation Act,and Clean Water Act. Although some sections of the OCSLA are oil and gasspecific, other sections are applicable to all minerals in the OCS. Theseprovisions require that activities be conducted in a safe manner and ina manner which is likely to prevent or minimize the likelihood of occurrenceswhich may cause damage to the environment. They permit lease cancellationor suspension of production or other operations if there is a threat ofserious, irreparable, or immediate harm to the marine, coastal, or humanenvironments. The absence of specific guidelines in the final rule providesthe flexibility needed for the development of environmental protectionmeasures tailored to the technologies, commodities, and OCS locations wherethe mining operation is to take place.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed the view that the provisionsin the operating regulations, giving the Director discretionary powersto disapprove a Testing Plan or Mining Plan, are poorly defined and notpractical.<T3>Response:</T3> We do not share this view. The regulations coveringthe Director's responsibilities and authority regarding review of TestingPlans and Mining Plans are logical, thorough, and practical. Sections onplan review and approval appropriately include consideration of environmentalcriteria and technical factors during the review of Testing Plans and MiningPlans. They provide ample opportunity for Governors of adjacent Statesto participate in the process and influence regulatory decisions. Whenrecommendations of the Governor of an adjacent State are not accepted,the Governor is provided a written explanation.<T3>Comment:</T3> A number of commenters expressed the view that the timelinesspecified in andSection; 282.12 preclude full State agency and public participation.<T3>Response:</T3> This comment parallels one addressed in the discussionunder andSection; 282.4. Joint State/Federal task forces and other arrangementsprovide substantial opportunity for active participation in the reviewand assessment process. The timeframes prescribed in the final rule trackthe timeframes mandated in the OCSLA for similar activities associatedwith oil and gas leases. Timeframes for comments may be extended when necessaryto assure sufficient response time for input by States and the public intothe NEPA process. Section 282.12(b)(2) had been modified by the additionof the phrase ``or other NEPA document'' following ``environmental assessment.''This modification recognizes that NEPA documentation of the environmentalimpacts of the activities described in a Delineation Plan may be in a formother than an environmental assessment.Section 282.13 Suspension of production or other operations.<T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter stated that the provisions for the suspensionof operations should be revised to require the Director to suspend operationsupon request by any State which has participated in joint coordinationefforts for reasons stated in andSection; 282.13(b) (1) through (9) <T3>Response:</T3> This recommendation has not been adopted. It would beinappropriate for a State to exercise such ultimate authority over Federallease activity. However, in those cases where a Governor of an adjacentState or appropriate State agency requests a suspension of operations,the Director would review the factors related to the request and suspendoperations when circumstances and conditions justify that action. It isanticipated that great weight will be given to requests made by officialsof adjacent States.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters commented on suspensions. Some expressedthe view that the final rule should provide more precise criteria and proceduresfor the Director to use in making decisions regarding the suspension ofproduction and other operations. Concern was expressed that the rule failedto provide for the compensation of lessees for areas which may be eliminatedfrom development on the basis of information developed during the explorationof the lease. The concern was expressed that there is no provision forcompensation for minerals left in place in order to protect sensitive environmentalor archaeological value absent cancellation of the lease.<T3>Response:</T3> Sufficient criteria are included to assure that a suspensionof production and other operations can be directed or approved by the Directorwhenever such action is necessary. The procedures for compensating lesseesfor lost access to OCS minerals due to development and production restrictionson a lease are based on the procedures contained in the OCSLA. Since leasesissued under the regulations in 30 CFR Part 281 are subject to the OCSLA,the regulations in Part 281 and this Part 282 are subject to compensationlimits contained in the OCSLA.Section 282.13(b)(8) has been modified to read:``(8) The Director determines that continued operation of a producing minewould result in waste; or'' This change is intended to clarify the factthat there must be a producing mine on the lease and the Director mustdetermine that continued operation of the mine would result in waste.Section 282.13(f)(2) has been modified by changing the period at the endof the proposed provision to a comma and adding the following language:``* * * unless the Director's approval of the lessee's request for suspensionauthorizes the payment of a lesser amount during the period of approvedsuspension.''Section 282.15 Cancellation of leases.Section 282.15(d)(3) has been clarified by the addition of a new paragraph(iii). The new language points up those instances where a lessee will notbe entitled to compensaiton when a lease is canceled.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart C_Obligations and Responsibilities of Lessees</ITAG>Section282.20 Obligations and responsibilities of lessees.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed the view that the evaluationof potential environmental impacts of activities proposed by a lessee shouldinclude an evaluation of the potential air emissions associated with theactivity and the onshore consequences of the expected OCS activities.<T3>Response:</T3> Section 282.20 has been modified by revising the endingof the second sentence in andSection;282.20(a) to read ``* * * human environment(including onshore air quality).'' This change is consistent with the provisionsof the OCSLA. Section 282.22(f) of the proposed and final rule specifiesthat ``a description of measures to be taken to avoid, minimize, or otherwisemitigate air, land, and water pollution'' will be submitted in supportof a Delineation Plan. To correct an oversight in the drafting of the proposedrule regarding Testing Plans and Mining Plans, new andSection;andSection;282.23(j)and 282.24(o) have been added to the final rule to specify the submissionof ``a description of measures to be taken to avoid, minimize, or otherwisemitigate air, land, and water pollution.'' Sections 282.23(j), (k), (l),(m), and (n) and andSection;andSection;282.24(o), (p), (q), and (r) have beenrenumbered andSection;282.23 (k), (l), (m), (n), (o) and andSection;282.24(p), (q), (r), and (s), respectively. It is anticipated that the Director'sreview of the air quality consequences of proposed OCS activities willfollow the practices and procedures specified in 30 CFR 250.33(b)(19),250.34(b)(12), 250.45 and 250.46.Section 282.21 Plans, general.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed the view that ``Preliminary activities''as defined in andSection;282.21(d) may cause significant adverse impact onOCS resources. One example was based on the view that seismic testing mightadversely affect marine mammals and fish with air bladders.<T3>Response:</T3> No change has been made in the final rule. As a partof the promulgation of this final rule, MMS conducted an environmentalassessment of the preliminary activities that could be conducted beforeDelineation, Testing, or Mining Plans were developed. The assessment resultedin a finding of no significant impacts for those activities. The lesseeis required to provide notice to the Director regarding proposed preliminaryactivities. When the activities described in a notice go beyond activitieswhich should have no significant adverse impact on the environment, theDirector will advise the proponent which activities are not viewed as preliminaryactivities and the steps to be taken before conducting those activities(e.g., submission of a Delineation Plan together with supporting documents).Section 282.22 Delineation plan.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters stated that the regulations or preambleof the <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice should make it clear that a consistencydetermination under section 307(c)(3)(B) of the Coastal Zone ManagementAct (CZMA) is applicable to the Director's approval of Delineation, Testing,and Mining Plans. The commenters recommended that the phrase ``where applicable''should be deleted from andSection;andSection;282.22(m)(4), 282.23(m)(4), and282.24(q)(4).<T3>Response:</T3> This recommendation has not been adopted. The activitiesdescribed in Delineation, Testing, and Mining Plans are, for the most part,located outside the coastal zone of adjacent States and not subject toa State implementation plan approved under CZMA. In these circumstances,the Director's approval of a Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan is notsubject to CZMA review and consistency concurrence. This position is basedupon the memorandum opinion dated October 4, 1988, prepared by the Officeof Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice for Abraham D. Sofaer, LegalAdviser, Department of State. The positions expressed in that opinion areconsistent with the position previously taken by DOI in this matter.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed the view that Delineation, Testing,and Mining Plans should be subject to State approval, similar to the approvalby the Director as provided in andSection;282.12.<T3>Response:</T3> This recommendation has not been adopted. The rule providessubstantial opportunity for State participation in the form of informalcoordination of the identification and resolution of issues as well asthe usual formal provisions for review and submission of comments and recommendations.In the final analysis, the decisions on the approval or disapproval ofthese activities are the responsibility of the Secretary of the Interior.Such decisions, by law, are to balance national objectives with State andlocal concerns.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that given the requirements forenvironmental monitoring, the lessee must be required to submit, as partof the Delineation Plan, a plan for gathering baseline data that characterizesthe marine environmental conditions and biological diversity of the leasearea prior to any exploration.<T3>Response:</T3> No exploration, testing, or mining activities may commenceby a lessee before the Director approves the appropriate plan. This approvalwill be contingent upon a determination that the adverse impacts of theproposed activities can be avoided, minimized, or otherwise mitigated.This determination will be based on environmental information preparedin association with the lease offering, as well as the site-specific informationdeveloped in conjunction with the preparation of the Delineation, Testing,and Mining Plans. It is not expected that, apart from the above site-specificrequirements, each lessee will necessarily be required to develop environmentalbaseline information. Information gathered as a result of MMS's environmentalstudies program and information available from other sources can be utilizedto ascertain the site-specific environmental conditions prior to the commencementof the environmental monitoring program conducted in association with specificmining activities.Section 282.28(b) provides adequate authority for the Director to requirethe lessee to collect additional environmental baseline data when dataare needed to support environmental evaluation of activities proposed undera Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed the view that the rule shouldclearly state that waste disposal or discharges will be subject to a NationalPollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, an Ocean Dumpingpermit, or other applicable permit.<T3>Response:</T3> It is the lessee's responsibility to be aware of andto obtain all necessary permits and approvals for the conduct of OCS miningactivities. This rule does not attempt to address all the requirementsimposed upon lessees by laws and regulations administered by other FederalAgencies. Thus, the fact that waste disposal or discharges from leaseholdactivities may be subject to NPDES permits or other permitting requirementssubject to the jurisdiction of a Federal Agency other than MMS has notbeen included in this rule.Section 282.23 Testing Plan.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed the view that the final ruleshould specifically require the submission of a Testing Plan to determinethe environmental effects of mining. Under the proposed rule, the submissionof a Testing Plan is at the option of the lessee.<T3>Response:</T3> This recommendation was not adopted. When the lesseeis able to submit a comprehensive Mining Plan complete with a descriptionof the potential environmental effects of the mining activities and necessarymitigating measures, there is no need to submit a Testing Plan.Section 282.24 Mining Plan.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that a Mining Plan be requiredto include the description of a stable reference area (also called a preservationalreference area). The area would serve as a reference area against whichthe impact of mining on the lease could be compared. No mining could occurin the reference area.<T3>Response:</T3> The MMS will not require a lessee's Mining Plan to designateor describe a stable (preservational) reference area where no mining canoccur. However, to properly address environmental concerns, a monitoringplan could include one or more control sites in which no mining would beconducted until late in the life of a lease. Nothing in these rules wouldpreclude a lessee from voluntarily designating a control site on its leaseas a stable reference area, available for study by any interested party.<T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter stated that site-specific assessments ofDelineation, Testing, and Mining Plans cannot address cumulative impactsand that cumulative impacts of mining activities should be made availableto the public prior to a lease sale.<T3>Response:</T3> The MMS anticipates that an EIS will be prepared priorto the first lease sale in an area. The NEPA documentation conducted priorto a subsequent lease sale will analyze the cumulative impacts of miningactivities conducted on previously issued leases together with the anticipatedimpacts of the mining activities that are expected to occur as a resultof the proposed sales of additional OCS mineral leases in the area.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter said the lessee should be required to mitigateany potential adverse environmental impact and that the Mining Plan shouldstipulate measures the lessee will be required to implement to accomplishthis. Another expressed doubts that mitigation measures exist to reducesignificant adverse environmental impacts associated with the mining ofconstruction materials, placers, and phosphorite.<T3>Response:</T3> No change has been made in the rule based on this comment.Mining Plans are required to describe mitigation measures to protect theenvironment. The MMS will carefully balance development and environmentalprotection objectives in its review of Mining Plans to determine appropriatemeasures for avoiding and minimizing the potentially adverse environmentaleffects of marine mining. Decades of commercial mining of marine sand andgravel in Europe and the Far East have demonstrated that the impacts ofthese activities can be mitigated. The International Council for the Explorationof the Seas has done considerable research with regard to mitigation ofpotential impact on fishery resources during marine mining activities.Placer mining also has occurred for many years but on a smaller scale,primarily in Indonesia. Geologically, the two types of deposits are similarso there is no reason to assume that significant impacts could not be addressedthrough mitigation measures. Commercial offshore mining for phosphoritehas not yet occurred anywhere in the world, but again, MMS does not assumethat significant impacts could not be satisfactorily mitigated. If significantimpacts cannot be mitigated in an acceptable manner, there will be no phosphoritemining on the OCS.Section 282.25 Plan modification. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that adjacent States should be notifiedand allowed to cooperate with the Director in the review and approval ofnew technology, techniques, procedures, equipment, or activities duringthe conduct of operations. <T3>Response:</T3> Section 282.25 Plan modification (formerly ModifiedPlan) has been revised and now explicitly provides the same opportunityfor adjacent State Governors to comment on significant modifications toplans as is provided for during the review of the initial Delineation,Testing, and Mining Plans. The Governors or other appropriate officialsof adjacent States also have an opportunity to review and comment on alternativetechnologies during the review of a proposed plan. The proposed plan mustidentify alternatives to technologies considered during the preparationof the plan. The comments of State officials on the proposed plan, if applicable,would be considered in the Director's review and approval of new or alternativetechnologies, techniques, procedures, equipment, or activities. If theDirector determines that the proposed new or alternative technology requiresplan modification, then approval of the modification would be subject toandSection; 282.25. Section 282.27 Conduct of operations.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed the view that the requirementthat lessees provide food and lodging for MMS inspectors should be extendedto include State inspectors. <T3>Response:</T3> Section 282.27(d)(2) makes provision for lessees tofurnish food, quarters, and transportation for MMS representatives performingfacilities inspections. In situations where State employees, as contractemployees of MMS, conduct the inspections, they would be afforded the samelessee provided food and lodging opportunities as any other MMS inspector.There is no provision in the law or these regulations authorizing inspectionsby persons other than representatives of the Federal Government, in thisinstance, the Secretary. Section 282.28 Environmental protection measures.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed concern that reliance on theNPDES system will fail to evaluate all but lethal impacts. It was assertedthat bioaccumulation, sublethal effects, and cumulative effects will notbe addressed by reliance on the NPDES permitting system administered byEPA. <T3>Response:</T3> The MMS does not mean to suggest that it will rely exclusivelyon theNPDES permitting system to protect the environment. The MMS willmaintain an active awareness of the results of ongoing research, as wellas monitoring results and will use those findings to require refinementsto an approved monitoring plan necessary to assure protection of the environment.The MMS intends to cooperate with EPA in the analysis of the environmentalaspects of proposed activities involving waste disposal and/or dischargeinto the waters above the OCS. This approach will avoid duplication ofeffort and lead to a monitoring plan and, where applicable, an NPDES permitdesigned to address the concerns expressed by the commenter. The potential that subtle effects will occur and go undetected by monitoringis fully recognized. One role of research is to identify and describe subtlephenomena. Considerable research is being funded which involves identificationof chronic and sublethal effects of impacts. The MMS intends to factorappropriate research findings into the mitigation of impacts as well asthe plans for monitoring impacts. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters requested that the rule be expandedto include specific details designed to protect the environment and tomitigate impacts that might result from the conduct of mining activities.Those commenters were especially concerned about the citation of proceduresto protect sensitive areas discovered after a lease is issued. They desiredassurances that such areas would be deleted from the areas subject to continuedmining activities. To this end, they requested that the rule provide alist of criteria to be used to determine that a threshold has been reachedwhich requires the initiation of mitigating measures. <T3>Response:</T3> These recommendations have not been adopted. The MMSrecognizes its responsibility to evaluate the environmental impacts aswell as the technical sufficiency of each activity described in a proposedDelineation, Testing, or Mining Plan. The MMS's administration of its responsibilitiesunder the OCSLA must be carried out in accordance with other governinglaws such as NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammals ProtectionAct, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act. The approach of balancingnational interests and other objectives mandated by the OCSLA togetherwith compliance with governing provisions of the aforementioned laws makeit impractical to include in the rule lists of prescriptive or detailedcriteria that will be used by the Director to assure that leasehold activitiesare conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. The case-by-caseapproach envisioned by this rule permits comprehensive environmental reviewof each of the different environmental setting. The range of potentialtechnologies and techniques that may be used in those settings can bestbe assessed as they relate to specific proposed activities associated withtarget OCS minerals. This rule provides general guidance for the protectionof the environment which will be supplemented by stipulations includedin individual leases based upon the environmental impact reviews and evaluationsconducted in association with the leasing process. These guidelines willbe further supplemented by conditions and mitigation measures defined inconnection with the environmental impact reviews and evaluations conductedin association with the approval of Delineation, Testing, and Mining Plans.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that the final rule includecriteria to be used to determine when an expected impact has been avoided,minimized, or otherwise mitigated. <T3>Response:</T3> This recommendation was not adopted. A properly designedand executed monitoring plan will provide the basis for determining thesuccess of mitigation measures. It is not practical, nor necessarily desirable,to establish by rulemaking, specific criteria for evaluating the effectivenessof mitigation measures that will be applied on a site-specific basis, tailoredto specific circumstances. A variety of mitigation techniques may be availableto achieve similar results, and sufficient flexibility should be retainedthrough plan approval and monitoring requirements to choose the most effectivefor a given set of circumstances, with regard to the particular setting,species of concern, seasons of the year, etc.<T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter recommended that monitoring be conductedat least monthly, to be responsive to seasonal changes, and that the monitoringof impacts be required during exploration, testing, and mining activities.Other commenters recommended that lessees be required, in every instance,to collect environmental baseline data prior to the submission of a DelineationPlan, Testing, plan, or Mining Plan. <T3>Response:</T3> These two recommendations were not adopted. Monitoringplans will be designed to consider factors such as seasonal changes andpracticular mining phases for the site and commodity being mined. For somecommodities this could mean almost continuous monitoring in the early stages;for others, a monthly requirement may be unnecessarily burdensome or costly.Although the regulations do not require lessees to collect baseline data,per se, prior to plan submissions, they do grant the Director authorityto require any environmental data necessary to assure adequate environmentalprotection (andSection; 282.11(b)(1)). A lessee's plan(s) must contain informationsufficient to permit ``comprehensive'' environmental evaluations (andSection;282.21(a)). Information will likely include baseline data for many areas,such as frontier areas. There are sufficient requirements in the plan obligationsof lessees (andSection; 282.21) and the authority of the Director (andSection;282.10) to assure that decisions of the Director are supported by sufficientbiological and ecological data to ensure environmentally sound operations.Additionally, in andSection; 282.28(b), the environmental protection measuresinfer that baseline data, whether provided by the lessees or availableelsewhere (e.g., through the Environmental Studies Program (ESP)), willbe considered in the Director's decisions. Furthermore, it allows the Directorto ``require the lessee to collect additional baseline data prior to theapproval of the activities proposed.''Section 282.29 Reports and records.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that copies of the report associatedwith revenue sharing and environmental compliance be provided to adjacentStates. <T3>Response:</T3> There are no provisions in this rule concerning revenuesharing since there are no provisions in the OCSLA for revenue sharingwhere those revenues are related to minerals other than oil and gas. Section282.29(c), regarding reports and records, requires within 3 months aftercompletion of operations a report to the Director which will contain environmentalinformation. Section 282.29(d) requires reports on the results of environmentalmonitoring. These reports will be available on a periodic basis. Interestedindividuals can contact the appropriate Regional Director for notice oftheir availability. Specific provisions for disclosure of data and informationto the public are included in andSection; 282.5. The provisions governingthe disclosure of data and information to an adjacent State are containedin andSection; 282.6 of this rule. Section 282.29(h) has been modified by revising the phrase ``sold, andto whom sold'': to read ``* * * sold, transferred, used, or otherwise disposedof, and to whom sold or transferred'';. This change was made to betterdefine the actions which might represent a ``sale'' of OCS minerals. Section 282.31 Suspension of production and other operations. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed the view that the Governors ofadjacent States should receive notice of lessee submitted requests forthe suspension of production or other operations. <T3>Response:</T3> The final rule does not adopt this view. A lessee'srequest for suspension of production or other operations may relate toa need for additional time to complete an activity that is necessary tocommence or restore production. In those instances where there is an activejoint State/Federal working arrangement, State participants would be fullyapprised of the situation.Section 282.40 Bonds. Section 282.40(e) has been clarified to indicate that the holder of a bondsubmitted pursuant to andSection; 256.58(a) of this chapter may amend thatbond to include the conditions for compliance specified in andSection; 282.40(e).Section 282.40(g) has been revised to clarify the provisions of the rulegoverning submission of an operator's bond in substitution for a lessee'sbond. <ITAG tagnum="84">Authors </ITAG>LeRon E.

White, andJames W. Workman of the MMS; Ransom Read of the Bureau of Mines; RonaldSmith and Donal F. Ziehl of the Bureau of Land Management; and John Padanof NOAA. An environmental assessment was prepared to evaluate this rulemaking andthe preliminary activities that could occur under these rules. The assessmentconcluded in a finding of no significant impact for those activities. TheDOI has determined that promulgation of this final rule does not constitutea major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment; therefore, an EIS is not required. The DOI has also determined that this document is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291 because the annual economic effect is less than $100million. The overall effect is expected to be less than $1 million peryear. The costs are based on an expected two sales per year with threenew leases per sale for a total of six new leases per year. When the programis mature, it is anticipated that there will be 10 preproduction leasesand 10 leases in production. The DOI certifies that the final rule dos not represent a governmentalaction capable of interference with constitutionally protected propertyrights. Thus, a Taking Implication Assessment has not been prepared pursuantto Executive Order 12630, Government Action and Interference with ConstitutionallyProtected Property Rights. The DOI certifies that the rule will not have a significant effect on asubstantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act(5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et. seq.</T3>), as the entities that normally engage in OCS mineralrelated activities are not considered small due to the technical complexityand financial resources needed to successfully conduct OCS mineral relatedactivities.The information collection requirements contained in 30 CFR Part 282 havebeen approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507and assigned clearance number 1010-0081.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 13.4 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
