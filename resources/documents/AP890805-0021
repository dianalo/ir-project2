The administration on Friday voiced optimism, tinged withcaution, at the promise of Iran's new president, HashemiRafsanjani, to help find a solution to the hostage situation.   President Bush said he would explore the overture ``to thefullest.''   ``I don't want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment, but there'sreason to be somewhat encouraged,'' Bush said about Rafsanjani'scomments.   Still, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the UnitedStates is ``always skeptical of what we hear from Iran,'' whileState Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler sounded a slightlymore positive reaction.   ``Based on the excerpts we have seen, President Rafsanjani'sremarks appear to be moderate and are therefore encouraging,'' shesaid. ``We have reason to believe that Iran is genuinely engagedand no reason to believe that its engagement is not focused in apositive direction.''   The United States, which does not have direct relations withIran, was using Switzerland as an intermediary to seek help fromIran, generally believed to wield influence with the Shiitekidnappers, officials said.   The president also called the head of the Geneva-basedInternational Red Cross, Cornelio Sommaruga, on Friday to voicesupport for the agency's involvement in trying to free thehostages, said Fitzwater.   Efforts by the Red Cross were alluded to by Rafsanjani when hesaid he would help the United States find solutions.   Bush spoke of a ``very extraordinarily broad exercise ofdiplomacy here in the last couple of days'' during which aides saidhe has appealed to dozens of world leaders for help.   The diplomatic efforts are continuing, Fitzwater said.   Another administration official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said ``It's in a holding pattern,'' while theadministration watches for its diplomatic overtures to produceresults. No new messages went to Iran on Friday, the official said.   During a photo session, Bush was asked about the massing of U.S.naval strength in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean as apossible indicator he had decided to retaliate militarily ifanother U.S. hostage was killed.   ``If I had made such a decision, I expect this would be the lastplace I'd be talking about it,'' Bush said.   But Fitzwater denied Bush had selected specific Lebanese targetsto hit if kidnappers had carried out a threat to kill Americanhostage Joseph Cicippio.   ``I will say he did not make final decisions,'' Fitzwater said.``It does not help the United States government or the UnitedStates to be discussing military tactics ... to be flexing ourmuscles in public.''   Bush was he was ``certainly pleased'' that the kidnappers onThursday indefinitely suspended their death threat against Cicippio.   ``I'm encouraged. But I don't want to get the hopes of thehostages' loved ones up once again, to have those hopes dashed.This is a brutal process, where you see people paraded beforecameras and their families get their hopes up,'' the president said.</TEXT></DOC>
