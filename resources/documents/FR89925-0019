ODS agreements (ODSAs), to which MARAD isa party, provide for the payment of ODS to the operators of eligible U.S.-flagcargo vessels that are operating in an ``essential service in the foreigncommerce of the United States.'' Payment of ODS is intended to help makethe cost of operating U.S.-flag vessels comparable to that of operatingsimilar vessels under the registry of a foreign country, which vesselsare substantial competitors of the subsidized U.S.-flag vessels (46 App.U.S.C. 1173(b)). <ITAG tagnum="84">Background_Legislative History </ITAG>In 1970, Congress enacted amendments to the Act that extended authorizationto pay ODS for the carriage of cargo on bulk cargo vessels (vessels thatare chartered or operated for one or more voyages over a period of timeto carry large shipments under contract, and that are not operated on anyparticular service, route or line). Prior to 1970, authorization to payODS was restricted to liner vessels (common carriers that travel on regularschedules along designated trade routes). The legislative history of the 1970 amendments indicates that Congresscontemplated that cargoes that are reserved to U.S.-flag vessels by thecargo preference laws of the United States (including, but not limitedto, 10 U.S.C. 2361 and 46 App. U.S.C. 1241), when carried by bulk vessels,would eventually be carried, if on a subsidized basis, at ``world rates.''\1\<NOTE/> World rates are set by competitive factors (e.g., supplyand demand) in the world market, in contrast to the sometimes higher, ``fairand reasonable rates'' (or ``premium rates'') that are paid to U.S.-flagvessels carrying reserved preference cargoes. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ H.R. Rep. No. 1073, 91st Cong., 2nd Sess., at p. 38 (1970).However, Congress also intended that the Secretary of Transportation considerthe criteria under sections 601 and 605(c) of the Act (46 App. U.S.C. 1171and 1175(c)) in connection with any subsidy award to bulk ship operators.\2\<NOTE/> Thus, before executing an ODS agreement for one or more bulkvessels, it is necessary that the Secretary determine, <T3>inter alia,</T3> that: (1) The operation of additional vessels withODS would carry out the purposes and policy of the Act; (2) the operationof such vessel or vessels is required to meet foreign-flag competitionand promote the foreign commerce of the United States; and (3) U.S.-flagservice in the bulk trades is inadequate. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>Id.</T3> at p. 42, S. Rep. No. 1080, 91st Cong., 2nd Sess., at p. 38(1970). <ITAG tagnum="84">Prior MARAD Policy</ITAG>The initial bulk ship applicants voluntarily excluded the carriage of preferencecargoes from their intended service. As a result, the ODS contracts enteredinto with bulk applicants specified that ``said vessels shall carry exclusivelycommercial liquid and dry bulk cargoes not subject to the cargo preferencestatutes of the United States * * *''In 1973, MARAD promulgated a regulation (46 CFR part 294) establishinga program for subsidizing the carriage of raw and processed agriculturalcommodities from the United States to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics(USSR). Pursuant to a bilateral agreement, one-third of such cargoes wasreserved for U.S.-flag vessels, but only if they could carry the cargoat a specified charter rate. Under 46 CFR part 294, MARAD entered intoshort-term ODSAs which provided subsidy for such carriage, on a voyage-to-voyagebasis, subject to a finding that service provided by U.S.-flag vesselsin that trade was inadequate and that payment of such ODS furthered thepurposes and policy of the Act. The subsidy payable by MARAD was subjectto abatement, calculated by a formula, if the charter rate exceeded a specifiedlevel. It was intended to further the foreign and trade policies of theUnited States, evidenced by maritime agreements that have been in effectbetween the United States and the USSR at various times.In 1976, ODSAs for bulk vessels that were not engaged in the grain tradewith the USSR were amended to provide that the vessels could carry non-reservedportions of preference cargoes at world rates with subsidy, but could notcarry any portion of cargo reserved to U.S.-flag vessels.In 1977, ODSAs for tankers were amended to allow the vessels to carry liquidbulk preference cargoes to meet the requirements of the Strategic PetroleumReserve (SPR) Program. The amendments specified that MARAD would not payODS for the carriage of that portion of SPR cargo reserved for U.S.-flagships_again consistent with MARAD's general policy.Also in 1977, an affiliated group of bulk operators applied for amendmentsto their existing ODSAs to allow the carriage of dry bulk statutory preferencecargo with ODS. The carriage of preference cargo was to be at world rates.Following administrative proceedings, and judicial review, the MaritimeSubsidy Board (Board) issued a Final Opinion and Order in Docket No. A-132,22 SRR 599 (M.S.B. 1983), which confirmed admission of the subject vesselsinto the preference trades with ODS. (See, <T3>Atlas Marine Co.,</T3> Docket Nos. S-605, S-607, S-614, 18 SRR 987(M.S.B. 1978); <T3>Aeron Marine Shipping Co.,</T3> Docket No. A-132, 19 SRR 111 (M.S.B.1979); <T3>Aeron Marine Shipping Co.,</T3> Docket No. A-132, 19 SRR 491 (M.S.B.1979). Also see <T3>Aeron Marine Shipping Co.</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> 525 F. Supp. 527 (D. D.C. 1981); and <T3>Aeron Marine Shipping Co., et al.</T3> v.<T3> United States,</T3> 695 F. 2d 567 (D.C. Cir. 1982). The Board foundthat U.S.-flag service in the bulk preference trades, including that ofthe applicants' bulk vessels, was and would continue to be inadequate,and that operation of the additional vessels in these trades would furtherthe purposes and policy of the Act, within the meaning of section 605(c)of the Act.The finding of inadequacy of U.S.-flag service was based on the standardthat there be a bare minimum of 50 percent U.S.-flag participation in thepreference trade. The relevant pool of cargo used to determine that percentagewas the bulk cargo that would move in the preference trades, not that whichwould move worldwide. The Board determined that the bulk preference tradesmay be treated as a separate market for applicants under section 605(c)of the Act.The Board, in making the necessary findings under section 601(a) of theAct that ODS for the vessel(s) in Docket A-132 was ``required to meet foreign-flagcompetition * * *,'' determined that section 601 does not require operationsexclusively meeting foreign-flag competition, but only substantially meetingforeign-flag competition. It was not proposed that the vessels operateexclusively in preference trade, but that such trade be available to thevessels only in addition to the normal commercial trade. The applicantslimited their proposed carriage of preference cargo to no more than one-halfof vessel operating revenue, on an annual basis, and on the same conditionsas are applicable to subsidized liner vessels under 46 CFR 280.4, providedthe rates were ``fair and reasonable'' for U.S.-flag commercial vessels.Under 46 CFR 280.4, a reduction in ODS is effected for carriage of preferencecargoes in excess of 50 percent, by gross freight revenue, on an annualbasis. As a result of judicial and administrative proceedings involving DocketA-132, MARAD entered into contract amendments with the applicants allowingthem to carry cargo subject to the cargo preference laws of the UnitedStates at fair and reasonable rates for privately owned subsidized U.S.-flagcommercial vessels, subject to subsidy abatement identical to that applicableto liner vessels, as prescribed in 46 CFR 280.4. These amendments weresuperseded by amendments similar in nature, but which included an ``augmentedbid'' procedure to be used by Government agencies when evaluating bidsfrom subsidized and unsubsidized bulk carriers. The augmented bid procedurewas formalized by regulation effective October 11, 1984 (46 CFR 381.8).On February 28, 1986, the Board authorized amendments to the contractsof subsidized bulk operators to allow their vessels to transport dry bulkpreference cargo at fair and reasonable rates, without ODS and subjectto certain conditions. (Docket No. S-764.) Presently, no U.S.-flag bulkoperator has a contract allowing carriage of premium-rated reserved preferencecargoes with ODS. <ITAG tagnum="84">Policy Clarification and Extension </ITAG>A shift in the form of U.S. foreign aid to certain countries that affectsthe use of U.S.-flag bulk vessels has occasioned a need to reexamine andclarify MARAD's policy regarding payment of ODS for the carriage of cargoesreserved to U.S.-flag vessels. Foreign assistance to some countries, previouslyprovided under the Commodity Import Program (CIP), has shifted to nonreimbursablecash grants (cash transfer program). The cargoes that move under the CIP(as well as other foreign assistance programs) are clearly covered by thecargo preference statutes. MARAD has consistently prohibited subsidizedbulk carriers from carrying these cargoes with subsidy, or has allowedcarriage subject to either an augmented bid procedure or a subsidy abatementformula. The court decision in <T3>Council of American-Flag Ship Operators </T3>v. <T3>U.S.,</T3> 596 F. Supp. 160 (D. D.C. 1984), <T3>affd.</T3> 782 F. 2d 278 (D.C. Cir., 1986), involved the question ofwhether cargoes shipped from the United States to a country that is therecipient of funds received under the cash transfer program are subjectto the Cargo Preference Act (46 App. U.S.C. 1241). If answered in the affirmative,such cargoes would be subject to the requirement that at least 50 percentof the gross tonnage be carried on U.S.-flag commercial vessels. The courtheld that the Cargo Preference Act does not apply to the cash transferprogram because that program, unlike the CIP, provides for unrestrictedcash transfers not tied to any obligation to make purchases in the UnitedStates. This decision notwithstanding, the principal recipient of cash transfersunder this program (Israel) voluntarily entered into a commitment to continueto follow procedures which had been followed under the CIP and to ship``a fair share'' of its imports of U.S. grain on U.S.-flag dry bulk carriers,at fair and reasonable rates. Because U.S. costs exceed foreign costs,the fair and reasonable rate for shipment of such cargoes has historicallyexceeded the world rate, and the cargo has moved at a ``premium'' rate.Foreign assistance in the nature of cash transfers was not known at thetime MARAD entered into the long-term subsidy contracts with U.S. bulkoperators, nor did this type of reservation scheme then exist. Had it existed,such cargoes would have been treated identically with statutory preferencecargoes. The carriage of any bulk cargoes strictly reserved to U.S.-flagbulk operators must be considered as being in addition to the operator'sexisting subsidized service for competitive worldwide carriage of bulkcommercial cargoes. For example, the Soviet grain subsidy program was notan adjunct of commercial carriage, but required separate consideration,just as separate consideration was required in Docket A-132. Any approvalof ODS for such additional service must be conditioned, as discussed above,on a finding that U.S.-flag service in the bulk preference trades is inadequate,that the operation of additional vessels with ODS would further the accomplishmentof the purposes and policy of the Act, and that the operation of such vessel(s)is required to meet foreign-flag competition and to promote the foreigncommerce of the United States. Absent these findings, on a current basis, MARAD believes that it is prohibitedby statute from paying ODS for the carriage of bulk cargoes which are reservedexclusively to U.S.-flag vessels, whether by statute or by voluntary agreementof a country that receives financial assistance from the U.S. Governmentin the form of unrestricted cash transfers. For the purposes of Sections601 and 605 of the Act, there is no substantive distinction between thesecargoes and preference cargoes. Since both types of reserved cargoes willmove on U.S.-flag bulk vessels, irrespective of subsidy, the award of subsidywould, absent special circumstances, not further the purposes and policyof the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">NPRM </ITAG>On September 26, 1988, MARAD published a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) for the purpose of clarifying its existing policy concerning theconditions for awarding ODS to the operators of bulk vessels (53 FR 37536).The NPRM invited comments on proposed new section 252.23 and specificallyasked that commenters address two related issues. First, should U.S.-flagvessels carrying this type of reserved cargo on a part-time basis, andotherwise carrying competitive commercial cargo that provides substantialportions of their total annual freight revenue, be considered substantiallymeeting foreign competition? If so, should payment of ODS for such operationbe subject to a reduction formula that is similar to that in 46 CFR 280.4?<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Responses </ITAG>MARAD received comments from three interested persons: two bulk vesseloperators and the Government of Israel (Israel). One operator, which opposesthis rulemaking, has contracted with Israel for the carriage of grain cargoes.The second operator, which supports the rule, is a competitor for the carriageof these grain cargoes. MARAD has carefully reviewed these comments. Each significant comment issummarized below, with a MARAD response to each. Comments Supporting the Rulemaking The operator which supports this rulemaking operates five bulk vesselsthat are eligible for and routinely compete for the carriage of cargoesthat are reserved to U.S.-flag bulk merchant vessels. <T3>Comment:</T3> The proposed rule is consistent with the Merchant MarineAct, 1936, since section 601(a) of the Act states that no application forODS shall be approved unless ``the operation of such vessel or vesselsin an essential service is required to meet foreign-flag competition.''Cargoes reserved to U.S.-flag vessels by an agreement between the U.S.Government and another government are not subject to competition by foreign-flagvessels. All of the available facts and circumstances concerning the ``SideLetters'' executed by Israel are consistent with the conclusion that thebulk grain cargoes that have been shipped to Israel on U.S.-flag vesselssince 1978, representing about 50 percent of Israel's annual requirementsfor the shipment of grain that it has financed with cash transfer programassistance, were reserved for U.S.-flag vessels pursuant to the provisionof those Side Letters. <T3>Response:</T3> MARAD agrees. Each year, Israel reports on its ``experienceunder the Cash Transfer Program'' for the previous year at the same timethat it signs a new Side Letter commitment. These representations are distributedto interested U.S. Government agencies by AID for review and comment priorto AID's signing the New Year's cash transfer (grant) agreement and disbursingfunds to Israel. These reports from Israel consistently show that the marketshare of U.S.-built carriers in the transport of U.S. grain exports toIsrael meets ``the desired mark of 50%.'' <T3>Comment:</T3> The Side Letters that were issued have been and willcontinue to be legally binding on Israel, which has continually shown anintent to be bound by them. Since it may be argued that these Side Lettersare not binding as international agreements because they are unilateral,it is suggested by this commenter that the final regulations should statethat an ``agreement'' encompasses any understanding or unilateral commitmentwhich has the effect of reserving cargoes to U.S.-flag vessels. <T3>Response:</T3> MARAD does not go so far as to maintain that the SideLetters are ``legally binding.'' It is clear, however, that they expressa commitment on the part of Israel, which Israel has shown an intend touphold, which has the effect of reserving cargoes for U.S.-flag vessels.MARAD agrees with the change suggested and it is incorporated in the finalrule. <T3>Comment:</T3> U.S.-flag vessels should be considered as substantiallymeeting foreign competition so long as they derive substantial portionsof their annual revenue from carrying commercial cargo, a policy requirementset forth by the Board in Docket A-132. That requirement is satisfied ifa U.S.-flag vessel derives substantial revenue from carrying cargoes forwhich it must compete with foreign-flag vessels. In Docket A-132, the Boardallowed subsidized vessels to carry preference cargo, after balancing twocompeting Congressional objectives; that of encouraging carriage of preferencecargoes on subsidized vessels, and that of supporting the participationof U.S.-flag vessels in the commercial (nonpreference) trade. That compromiseis just as germane to cargoes that are reserved to U.S.-flag vessels pursuantto agreement or understanding. <T3>Response:</T3> MARAD agrees. <T3>Comment:</T3> While vessels eligible to receive ODS should be allowedto carry preference cargoes, ODS should not be payable for the carriageof cargoes reserved to U.S.-flag vessels. Rather, this commenter favorsthe payment of fair and reasonable rates for preference cargoes, whetherthe vessel is eligible for ODS or not. Israel has entered into an understandingthat it would pay fair and reasonable rates for U.S.-flag vessels, nota reduced rate made possible by ODS payments to the bulk operator thatcould be passed on. Payment of subsidy to the bulk operator would allowIsrael to avoid its obligations to pay fair and reasonable rates and toobtain rates equivalent to the lower rates of lower cost foreign-flag vessels.Before vessels carrying reserved cargoes may become eligible for ODS, theymust comply with the provisions of section 605(c) of the Act, and establishthat ``the service already provided by vessels of United States registryis inadequate,'' as was done in Docket A-132 with respect to certain vesselscarrying preference cargoes. Should the vessel operator establish thisinadequacy, MARAD should make the bid augmentation rule at 46 CFR 381.8applicable to the carriage of these reserved cargoes, as its underlyingrationale is no less applicable to cargoes reserved to U.S.-flag vesselsother than by the cargo preference statutes. <T3>Response:</T3> MARAD has determined that the subsidy reduction formularule used for liner vessels at 46 CFR 280.4 is not appropriate in thissituation. MARAD likewise believes that the bid augmentation rule at 46CFR 381.8 would be inappropriate. When carrying reserved cargoes, U.S.-flagbulk vessels will not be eligible for ODS. When carrying commercial cargoessubject to foreign-flag competition, they will be fully eligible. Opposition to Rulemaking <ITAG tagnum="81">Comments by the Government of Israel </ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> Israel states that ``The Side Letter is not a commitmentto follow the cargo preference procedures of the Commodity Import Program(``CIP''). It is only a commitment to carry a certain portion of graincargoes on U.S. flag carriers at fair and reasonable rates.'' (emphasisadded), and that ``The procedures referred to in Israel's Side Letter relateonly to vessel tendering and fixturing procedures, not to Cargo PreferenceAct procedures or requirements.'' <T3>Response:</T3> The CASO decision that the Cargo Preference Act doesnot apply to the cash transfer program notwithstanding, it is preciselybecause of Israel's ``commitment to carry a certain portion of grain cargoeson U.S. flag carriers at fair and reasonable rates'' that MARAD believesit is prohibited by statute from paying ODS for carriage of those cargoes_thereis no foreign competition for them. <T3>Comment:</T3> Israel further notes that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed rule also states that the cargoes currently being transportedunder the Consecutive Voyage Charter Agreement signed by the Governmentof Israel on July 30, 1987 are cargoes `under the Cash Transfer Program.'This statement is incorrect. There are no cash transfer funds involvedin the purchase of transportation of grain cargoes being carried to Israel.</ITAG><T3>Response:</T3> This particular Charter Agreement provides a good exampleof the type of voyages for which operators would not be eligible to receiveODS under this rulemaking. Although in most cases it may be difficult to determine whether cargoesare purchased with cash transfer funds provided by the U.S. Government,counsel for Israel at the time they negotiated the Charter Agreement statedin letters to MARAD that ``<T3>cash transfer assistance will be utilized </T3>to purchase the grainwhich will be transported pursuant to the proposed charter* * * *'' ``Duringthe period of the charter, the ULTRASEA will be carrying grain <T3> cargoes purchased</T3> by the Government of Israel <T3>with cash transfer funds</T3>,'' and ``charter the ULTRASEA to transport<T3>cargo purchased with cash transfer funds.''</T3> (Emphasis added).While MARAD would normally be expected to place reasonable reliance onexpressions of fact submitted by counsel for parties seeking various necessaryapprovals, in the case here cited by Israel that was not necessary. Paragraph11 of the Charter Agreement provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">``11. <T3>Termination of U.S. flag requirement.</T3> Charterers [Israel] shallhave the option of cancelling the unexpired portion of this Charter withoutpayment of any termination fee if:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Charterers shall not <T3>be required</T3> to ship Cash Transfer Program cargoes on U.S. flagvessels; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Charterers cease to receive Cash Transfer Program cargoes <T3>requiring</T3> shipment on U.S. flag vessels.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(emphasis added) This, MARAD believes, is a clear indication that Israel (as even more clearlystated in their comments quoted above) intended that the Side Letters wouldrequire carriage of cargoes on U.S.-flag vessels, that they do in factallocate certain cargoes for exclusive U.S.-flag carriage, and that thecargoes to be carried under the Charter Agreement were intended by Israelto be included in that allocation. The source of funds utilized for thepurchase of the cargoes or the payment of ocean freight becomes irrelevant_thereis no foreign-flag competition for those cargoes. <ITAG tagnum="81">Comments by Operator Opposed </ITAG>The operator which opposes this rulemaking operates two bulk vessels thatare eligible for cargoes that are reserved to U.S.-flag vessels, and currentlyhas one of the vessels under long-term consecutive voyage charter to Israelfor the carriage of grain cargoes. <T3>Comment.</T3> MARAD cannot, by policy pronouncement in a rulemakingaction, alter its obligation to pay subsidy under an ODSA which the commenteralleges obligates MARAD to pay ODS for the carriage of grain cargoes toIsrael that are ``commercial cargoes not subject to the cargo preferencestatutes of the United States* * *'' The single exclusion of statutorypreference cargoes from the ODSA, as well as the history of that ODSA,shows that the subject of cargo exclusion was resolved within that singleexclusion, with no intent that there be future exclusions. MARAD cannot,by rulemaking or other action, reinterpret contract provisions to excludesubsidy for the carriage of individual cargoes. As the operator under anODSA, the commenter had no reason to believe that the carriage of commercialcargoes not subject to U.S. cargo preference laws could ever be excludedfrom ODS eligibility. When an ODS contractor expends large amounts of moneyon the construction and operation of a vessel, in reliance upon a statutoryand contractual scheme which it reasonably expects to continue, neitherstatute or regulation may change that scheme to the substantial detrimentof the contractor. <T3>Response: </T3>The thrust of the commenter's argument is that sincethe only specific exclusion of cargoes under the ODSA was statutory preferencecargoes, and a court decided thirteen years later that cash transfer programcargoes are not statutory preference cargoes, all other cargoes may becarried and are entitled to ODS, without any further consideration by theBoard. The legislative history of the Act demonstrates clearly that foreigncompetition for cargo is a prerequisite for the grant of subsidy. Foreignassistance in the nature of cash transfers was unknown at the time MARADentered into long-term ODSAs with bulk operators. Also nonexistent wasany type of an agreement to which the United States was a party under whicha foreign country was obligated to reserve cargoes purchased from UnitedStates sources for carriage by U.S.-flag vessels. Had this arrangementexisted, or had it been contemplated or foreseeable, it is reasonable toassume that the subject would have been considered under sections 601 and605(c) of the Act and addressed in the ODSAs, and that such reserved cargoeswould have been treated in the same way as preference cargoes, i.e., operatorsreceiving ODS would have been excluded from participation in the carriageof these cargoes. Carriage of these reserved cargoes must be consideredas being in addition to existing subsidized services for competitive worldwidecarriage of bulk commercial cargoes. Any approval of ODS for such additionalservice is dependent on a finding by the Board that subsidized operationis required to meet foreign-flag competition. The cargoes at issue werealways reserved for U.S.-flag vessels by the Side Letters, to be carriedat premium rates. There was never a possibility of foreign-flag competition,which is a condition precedent to granting subsidy. Although the Side Lettersdo not mention a specific share of cargo that is being reserved, Israelhas consistently reserved 50 percent of the trade for U.S. carriage since1978, treating it in the same manner as CIP cargoes that had been shippedin prior years. This commenter had no reasonable basis to assume that subsidywould be paid for the carriage of any cargo that is exclusively reservedfor U.S.-flag vessels, since there was no precedent for such action.This commenter certainly had not expended large amounts of money to constructand operate a vessel in reliance on subsidy being paid for reserved cargoes.In fact, before requesting MARAD approval, the operator entered into aConsecutive Voyage Charter Agreement with Israel providing that the charteris subject to MARAD approval of ODS for both the initial 3-year term, and,if extended, the additional two years of the charter. This operator obviouslyrecognized that MARAD had discretion to award subsidy for an additionalservice not contemplated by the ODSA. It was also certainly aware of thefact that no bulk operator had applied for subsidy with respect to cashtransfer program cargoes in the nine years since the first Side Letterwas executed.<T3>Comment: </T3>Israel's Side Letters do not vest MARAD with the authorityto amend this operator's ODSA because the Side Letters mention neitherthe reservation of any cargo for U.S.-flag vessels nor a figure of 50 percentcargo share. Rather, it claims that Israel's expression of an intent tofollow procedures with a view ``toward assuring a fair share of the marketfor American Carriers'' is not a commitment to reserve 50 percent of bulkcargoes for U.S.-flag vessels.<T3>Response: </T3>The first Side Letter, executed in 1978, provided, inpertinent part, that ``(r)egarding the carriage of goods imported fromthe United States, * * * [Israel] will continue to follow <T3>present procedures</T3> for bulk shipments of grain on dry bulk carrier.''(emphasis added)Subsequent Side Letters, which have been executed annually for subsequentfiscal years, have reiterated that commitment. Each renewal of the originalSide Letter specifically states that Israel ``would like to take this opportunityto renew the aforementioned commitments'' for the upcoming fiscal year.Each Side Letter provides that it shall be effective for a definite periodof time, a clear indication of an intent that the letters are in fact binding.Each year Israel has provided a report containing a review of its compliancewith the Side Letter for the previous year. The ``present procedures''adopted by Israel pursuant to the Side Letters are substantially similarto the procedure used with respect to preference cargoes. By agreeing tofollow what are essentially cargo preference procedures, Israel, in effect,agreed that grain cargo shipped to Israel will be treated like preferencecargoes. The conduct of Israel supports only one conclusion, namely, thatIsrael was committed to using U.S.-flag ships to carry 50 percent of cargoesthat were purchased in accordance with the Side Letter Agreement, and tothe extent that U.S.-flag vessels were available, has done so every yearsince it executed the first Side Letter in 1978. Those cargoes were reservedfor U.S.-flag vessels and could have been shipped only on U.S.-flag vessels.<T3>Comment: </T3>There is no statutory support for creating a categoryof cargo called ``reserved'' cargo.Congress has recognized only two categories of cargo, commercial and preference.That which is not preference is commercial and may be subsidized. The Congresshas been aware of the Side Letters since 1978 and of the CASO decisionthat was finalized in 1986, but has not seen fit to enact legislation consistentwith MARAD's present position, although it has enacted numerous amendmentsto the Act, including amendments affecting the ODS program.<T3>Response: </T3>ODS has not been paid to any operator for the carriageof any of these reserved cargoes since the initiation of the procedurespursuant to the first Side Agreement in 1978. The first and only requestoccurred in late 1987, and is the subject of litigation between this operatorand the United States. MARAD believes that its position on this issue istotally consistent with Congressional intent and prior MARAD administrativeactions.<T3>Comment: </T3>The examples of prior policy set forth in the NPRM disproveMARAD's position. MARAD reliance on its prior policy concerning the subsidizedcarriage of grain to the USSR is misplaced since MARAD treated those cargoesas commercial, despite the fact that they were reserved for U.S.-flag vessels,and paid ODS for their carriage. The 1976 ODSA amendments allowing bulkvessels to carry non-reserved portions of preference cargoes with subsidy,and the 1977 amendments for tankers allowing SPR cargoes to be carriedproves that the ODSAs obligate MARAD to pay ODS for any cargo, even preferencecargo, so long as it is not required by statute to move on U.S.-flag vessels.Israeli grain cargoes are not required by statute to move on U.S.-flagvessels. Docket A-132 involved application for ODS for the carriage ofpreference cargoes that were reserved by statute for U.S.-flag vessels,again consistent with the argument that these are the only cargoes excludedby contract from eligibility for ODS. The last action cited by MARAD ofFebruary 28, 1986, is not relevant because it relates to the carriage ofcargoes without ODS.<T3>Response: </T3>The Regulation governing subsidy calculation for theRussian grain program clearly contemplated foreign-flag competition inthat trade:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Foreign flag competition. </T3>For purposes of establishing such sumsas the Board determines are necessary to make the cost of operating U.S.-flagvessels competitive with the cost of operating similar vessels under theregistry of a foreign country, <T3>the Board shall select a typical foreign-flag vessel which has actuallyparticipated in the carriage of export bulk raw and processed agriculturalcommodities from the U.S. to the USSR. . . .</T3></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(46 CFR 294.3(b)) (emphasis added) Under the Russian grain regulation, MARAD entered into short-term ODSAsrather than the usual 20-year ODSA, which provided subsidy for such carriage,subject to a finding that service provided by U.S.-flag vessels in thattrade was inadequate and that payment of such ODS furthered the purposesand policy of the Act. The subsidy payable by MARAD was subject to abatement,calculated by a formula, if the charter rate exceeded a specified level.Here, on the other hand, there is no foreign competition for cargoes reservedby the Israeli Side Letters for U.S.-flag ships, so that carriage of suchcargoes is not subsidizable. The Russian grain program is readily distinguishablefrom the present case.The other examples of prior MARAD policy and practice, rather than supportingthis commenter's contention that only preference cargo required by statuteto move on U.S.-flag vessels were excluded from subsidy under the ODSAs,are consistent with MARAD's policy that subsidy for any new or additionalservice requires current findings under sections 601 and 605(c) of theAct.<T3>Comment: </T3>Even if new findings of foreign-flag competition wererequired for each voyage under an ODSA, the carriage of these grain cargoesto Israel meets foreign-flag competition. Israel has stated that it wouldnot have entered into a long-term charter of the commenter's vessel absentODS being paid for that vessel, and that these cargoes would have movedon foreign-flag vessels.<T3>Response: </T3>MARAD accepts the statement of Israel. The fact remains,however, that the charter it refers to clearly contemplates, as discussedearlier, the carriage of cargoes reserved to U.S.-flag vessels, which carriagewould be reported by Israel against its commitment. There was no foreigncompetition for the charter.<T3>Comment. </T3>MARAD is misapplying its own precedents. The agency hasfound previously that foreign-flag competition is present if the subsidizedvessel competes for commercial backhaul cargo. Furthermore, if a vessel'scharter rate is directly affected by foreign-flag rates, that vessel ismeeting foreign-flag competition. This is precisely what is happening inthe carriage of Israeli grain cargo, since a critical consideration inIsrael's decision to charter this operator's vessel was whether the charterrates were tending toward world rates.<T3>Response: </T3>The first statement is misleading. In the case cited,the vessel would have received ODS, but both outbound (preference) andinbound (non-preference) cargoes were required to be carried at ``worldrates'' and the ships ``* * * would continue to operate substantially inthe U.S. foreign commerce exclusive of the bulk preference trade becauseof past operations and the opportunity for backhaul movements.'' Underthe terms of this commenter's charter, the cargoes are being carried ata rate approximately 25 percent above world rates, and the vessel may onlycarry backhaul cargoes with the approval of Israel. This type of operationis clearly distinguishable from the case cited by the commenter. Thereis no basis for the allegation that the commenter's charter rate was ``directlyaffected by foreign-flag rates.''<T3>Comment. </T3>If MARAD amends ODSAs to allow subsidy for vessels thatcarry this type of reserved cargo on a part-time basis, and otherwise carrycompetitive commercial cargo that provides substantial portions of thevessels' total annual freight revenue, so as to be considered as substantiallymeeting foreign competition, ODS payments should not be subject to a reductionformula. Since grain cargoes moving to Israel are ``commercial'' cargoes(not statutory preference cargoes), a subsidy abatement is totally inappropriate.Abatement will undermine the very purpose of the Merchant Marine Act of1970_to increase U.S.-flag carriage of bulk cargoes in U.S. foreign commerce.Israeli grain cargoes are not the equivalent of statutorily reserved preferencecargoes because they are purchased in purely commercial transactions byprivate Israeli companies using private funds. Even if the grain cargoesbeing carried to Israel were the equivalent of preference cargoes, MARADhas made it clear in a 1979 Board action that subsidy abatement is notnecessary for the carriage of preference cargoes.<T3>Response: </T3>MARAD has not proposed to amend ODSAs. As previouslydiscussed, MARAD believes that statutory constraints of sections 601 and605(c) of the Act control the award of ODS.Section 601 of the Act, provides that no application for ODS shall be consideredunless the Secretary determines_<ITAG tagnum="21">``* * * that (1) the operation of such vessel or vessels in an essentialservice is required to meet foreign-flag competition and to promote theforeign commerce of the United States * * *. [and] (4) the granting ofthe aid applied for is necessary to place the proposed operations of thevessel or vessels on a parity with those of foreign competitors, and isreasonably calculated to carry out effectively the purposes and policyof this Act * * *''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(46 App. U.S.C. 1171(a))This requirement is a discrete step in the approval process of an applicationfor subsidy, and its outcome is reflected in the service description ofeach contract. It is generally satisfied when the contract is approvedand would not normally be brought into consideration unless an applicationfor additional (or new) service was being considered. Article 1-2(a) ofthe typical bulk vessel ODSA, the service description, appears to define,by explanation, ``commercial'' cargoes as being ``cargoes not subject tothe cargo preference statutes.'' MARAD believes, however, that the referenceto the cargo preference statute is not a strict delimitation of cargoesthat are not ``commercial,'' but rather a shorthand way to categorize suchcargoes as known at the time. The commenter's ODSA, MA/MSB-129, was enteredinto on June 30, 1971. Foreign aid in the form of cash transfers was notknown (or rarely utilized) at the time.MARAD believes the intent of the Congress in enacting section 601 can onlybe properly implemented by limiting the award of ODS to those vessels engagedin operations in which they are substantially meeting foreign competition.As MARAD is unable to make such a finding in this instance, it has determinedthat a subsidy reduction formula such as that in 46 CFR 280.4 is inappropriate.On voyages on which they carry these reserved cargoes, U.S.-flag bulk vesselswill simply not be eligible for ODS. While carrying commercial cargoessubject to foreign competition, they will receive full ODS.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Regulatory Impact</ITAG>This rulemaking has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291, and it hasbeen determined that this is not a major rule. It will not result in anannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. There will be noincrease in production costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local governments, agencies, or geographic regions. Furthermore,it will not adversely affect competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.While this rulemaking does not involve any change in important Departmentalpolicies, it is considered significant because of its considerable publicinterest. However, because the economic impact should be minimal, furtherregulatory evaluation is not necessary. Moreover, the Maritime Administratorcertifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.This rulemaking does not significantly affect the environment. An environmentalimpact statement is not required under the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969. It has also been reviewed under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,and it has been determined that it does not have sufficient implicationsfor federalism to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The amendment to the regulations at 46 CFR part 252 contains no new informationcollection requirements that require approval of the Office of Managementand Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 252 </ITAG>Grant programs_Transportation, Maritime carriers, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.Accordingly, MARAD is issuing, as a final rule, amendments to amend 46CFR part 252, as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 252_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.

The payment of ODS will bemade only for carriage of commercial cargoes for which U.S.-flag vesselsare in direct competition with foreign-flag vessels. An example of cargothat is excluded is bulk cargo reported by a shipper as the U.S.-flag shareof cargoes subject to an agreement (including a unilateral commitment bya foreign government which has the effect of reserving cargoes for U.S.-flagvessels), between the United States and a foreign government in connectionwith any U.S. cash transfer foreign assistance program. In such a circumstance,there is no foreign-flag competition for such cargoes.<ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Maritime Administrator.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 19, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
