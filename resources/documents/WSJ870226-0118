Although company officials expressed the hope that the preliminary settlement with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would help get it off the hot seat, the accord may have had the opposite effect.    The agreement, which included a provision to perform $409 million of repair work at cost, immediately drew attacks from critics in Washington who charged that it didn't impose stiff enough penalties.    &quot;The company should be in a position of mitigating its damages rather than just limiting its profits,&quot; said Rep. Robert G. Torricelli (D., N.J.), a member of the House Science and Technology Committee. &quot;This way there's no real penalty at all.&quot;    The settlement, which restructures Morton Thiokol's contract with NASA, also raised questions about whether the space agency's contracts with the company provided adequate disincentives for contractor mistakes. Under its original contract with Morton Thiokol, $10 million was the maximum penalty that NASA could impose -- an amount that pales by comparison to damages suffered by other corporations whose business actions have led to catastrophe.    &quot;Auto companies have had to pay more for car wrecks,&quot; said one congressional aide.    The destruction of the Challenger in January 1986 was caused by design flaws in the shuttle's booster rocket that were exacerbated by frigid weather, investigators have found. In the preliminary settlement reached Tuesday, there was no admission by Morton Thiokol of any responsibility or liability for the accident.    Officials of the space agency immediately sought to defend the agreement. &quot;It was a good result for NASA and a good result for the taxpayer,&quot; said Sue Smith, chief counsel for the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. &quot;I don't know which will hurt the company the most: the $10 million in lost profit or having to perform $409 million of work at no cost. Both are substantial penalties.&quot;    NASA officials also said the restructured contract with Morton Thiokol eliminates the provision that limited its ability to penalize a contractor to $10 million of its profits -- a clause that was unique to the most recent shuttle contracts. Earlier NASA agreements allowed the agency to eliminate a contractor's profits entirely for poor performance. It said it will revert to that practice.    Some congressional critics, however, said they believe the penalty for contributing to the explosion of the shuttle should go beyond merely eliminating profits. &quot;It's incredible that that's the worst thing that could happen to them,&quot; said an aide to Sen. Donald Riegle of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Science Technology and Space Committee.    Rep. Torricelli and Rep. Bill Nelson (D., Fla.), chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees NASA, previously wrote to the General Accounting Office to ask for a review of NASA's talks with Morton Thiokol. Congressional officials said the subject of the NASA settlement would come under review in hearings of the House Science and Technology Committee scheduled for today.    There also was concern that the restructured contract allows Thiokol to make up half of the lost profit of $10 million with additional profit on new work. Under the previous contract, Thiokol's maximum earning potential was $91 million. Now the maximum is $86 million although the company will have to do substantially more work to earn the lower amount.    Disappointment with the settlement also may prompt Congress to press harder for a second supplier for the booster rockets. NASA is due on March 31 to present a report on its plans for securing a second source, though space agency officials have said that chances are strong that Thiokol will remain the only supplier for at least two or three years. </TEXT></DOC>
