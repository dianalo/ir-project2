The magazine's latest annual survey of the top 100 blackindustrial and service companies shows that, like many U.S.companies in general, leading black businesses are exploring newapproaches in order to be competitive.   Many black companies have grown recently through mergers andacquisitions, joint ventures, new technology and marketingapproaches, and branching out into new industries, said the surveyin the magazine's June issue.   Taken together, the top 100 companies ranked in the survey hadgross revenues of $4.1 billion in 1987. All but one of them areprivately owned.   The competition was fierce enough last year to force intobankruptcy three companies formerly on the list: United Chem-Con,an electronics manufacturer and defense contractor; hair-careproducts maker American Beauty Products; and oil productsdistributor J.R. Son Inc.   The survey points to black-owned computer and informationservices companies, construction firms, hair-care products makersand car dealerships as especially successful categories.   The biggest and fastest-growing black company is TLC BeatriceInternational Holdings Inc., a food manufacturer and distributorformed from the $985 million leveraged buyout of BeatriceInternational. In a leveraged buyout, the acquirer finances thepurchase of the target company with sales of its assets or the cashflow of the target company.   New York-based TLC Beatrice, headed by Wall Street attorneyReginald F. Lewis, was the first black company to make more than $1billion in annual sales and reported revenue of $1.8 billion in1987. The company's 61 businesses include Butterball turkeys andGood Humor ice cream.   The buyout of Beatrice ``places Lewis on the cutting edge ofcorporate finance and gives him access to Europe, Latin America andAsia, three of the world's fastest-growing markets,'' the BlackEnterprise survey says.   Other black entrepreneurs _ such as Gary L. White of Trans JonesInc.-Jones Transfer Co. and C. Everett Wallace of City andamp; SuburbanDistributors Inc. _ have used leveraged buyouts to propel theircompanies into the top 100.   The second-ranked company on the list, Johnson Publishing Co.Inc., saw its growth boosted by its cosmetics and hair-careproducts and its syndicated television show, according to thereport.   The Chicago-based company, which had $201.6 million in saleslast year, markets Fashion Fair products and publishes Ebony, Jetand Ebony Man.   Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Inc., No. 3 on the list, hasgrown by purchasing several profitable companies and bottlingfranchises through joint ventures with other black businesses. Thecompany rang up 1987 sales of $166 million.   Construction firm H.J. Russell andamp; Co. continues to show itsstrength in competitive bidding for contracts and has aggressivelybranched out into real estate development with Gibraltar Land Inc.,the survey says. Fourth-ranked Russell, based in Atlanta, postedsales of $141.9 million.   No. 5 Motown Industries has sought to restructure itsoperations, infusing $38 million into its records subsidiary forthe development and promotion of new artists. Los Angeles-basedMotown managed to record $100 million in sales last year.   Hair-care maker Johnson Products Co. Inc., the only publiclyheld company on the list at No. 19, was hit hardest by the stockmarket collapse on Oct. 19: its stock dropped from $4 a share tojust under $3. The Chicago-based company, like other blackhair-care specialists, continues to battle white-owned giants likeAlberto-Culver and Revlon for market share.   Johnson Products' 1987 sales were $33.9 million.</TEXT></DOC>
