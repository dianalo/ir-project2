It was as an artist that the empress of African song first spokeout against the system of discrimination in South Africa,testifying before the United Nations Special Committee on Apartheidin 1963. In retaliation, South Africa banned her records.   ``Afterward, I tell the press, `I am not a politician or adiplomat,''' Makeba writes in her recently published autobiography``Makeba: My Story,'' written with James Hall (New AmericanLibrary, $18.95).   ``I am just a singer, I say. But in South Africa, when theauthorities learn of my testimony, I become something else: acriminal.''   ``Makeba: My Story,'' recounts some of the joy and sadness inthe life of one of South Africa's most acclaimed singers, who hasbeen in exile from her native country since 1959.   She decided to write her autobiography five years ago. ``I neverreally wanted to write a book. Besides, I don't know how to write.''   However, Makeba said, friends convinced her of the book'simportance; she was ``the first artist to leave the country andmake some type of impact on the world'' while not forgetting theproblems that exist in South Africa.   ``They said that if anything should happen to me, others couldwrite whatever they wanted without my being able to say whetherit's true or false,'' she said.   ``It was so hard. Every time I read it, I just cry. This morningI was looking at the book. ... I looked at it for maybe for 10minutes and I was crying.''   The book coincides with the release of ``Sangoma,'' the singer'sfirst American album since the late 1960s. It is a collection of 19African songs, sung in three languages. The songs were taught toMakeba by her mother, who was a Sangoma, the South African term fora healer in close communication with ancestral spirits.   ```Sangoma' is the most personal record I've made,'' Makebasaid. ``I like the songs because every time I sing them I thinkabout my mother because she sung them.''   Born in Johannesburg on March 4, 1932, with the Xhosa tribalname Zensile, Makeba has survived bitter personal and careersetbacks.   When she was just 18 days old, she went to jail for six monthswith her mother, who had illegally brewed homemade beer to supportthe family. Later, after her mother was released, the family movedto Pretoria, where they endured the hardship of apartheid.   At a young age, she found joy in singing. Some of the songsprotested her country's white minority regime: The songs were a wayshe and others could demonstrate their defiance in school andchurch choruses.   Makeba started her professional career in 1952. She was chosenas the female vocalist for one of the country's top bands, theManhattan Brothers.   In 1955 she accepted a small role in the documentary, ``ComeBack Africa,'' based on the life of a murdered black boxer. HarryBelafonte spotted her in the film, helped her to obtain a visa andthen boosted her career when she arrived in the United States in1959.   She writes in her book that Belafonte _ or ``Big Brother,'' asshe calls him _ gave her this advice: ``You must always be carefulhow you conduct yourself on stage and off, because some day youwill have a chance to speak on behalf of your people.''   With her ``click'' singing and deep but lilting voice, Makebacreated a sensation in her first American TV appearances and NewYork club dates, and she was received by the late Ethiopian EmperorHaile Selassie, Cuban President Fidel Castro, the late PresidentJohn F. Kennedy and other world leaders.   In 1960, her mother died and she wished to return home to visither grave and see relatives. She went to the South Africanconsulate in New York.   ``The man at the desk takes my passport. He does not speak tome, but to himself when he says, `Miriam Makeba,' as if he wasexpecting this moment,'' she writes. ``He takes a rubber stamp andslams it down on my passport. Then he walks away. I pick up mypassport. It is stamped `INVALID.'''   She has not been allowed to return to South Africa since.   Her troubles were not limited to her native land. She has beenmarried five times, including once to South African trumpet playerHugh Maskela, but her career in the United States was most affectedby her marriage to black activist Stokely Carmichael.   ``I never had any problems with the officials in this country,it's just that when I married Stokely ... many concerts that werebooked for me were canceled _ I guess because some people took mymarriage so personally,'' she said.   ``And when that happened I had a tour planned in Europe, so Ijust packed up and went to some of my friends in Guinea.''   Her friendship with Guinea's president, Sequo Toure, led to herwork as a Guinean delegate to the United Nations.   More recently, Makeba completed six months as a special guest onPaul Simon's Graceland World Tour, which included her long-awaitedreturn to the United States.   ``When we went to Zimbabwe, it was another experience,'' shesaid. ``Just looking out from the stage and seeing all those peopletight in the stadium. Black people, white people _ from all walksof life _ just swaying together to the music. It was so beautiful.   ``It made me almost cry, because I said why can't it be likethat just next door. Because we were right next door from home.''   Makeba hopes that one day she will return to South Africa.   ``I guess if I stop believing that I will go home, there wouldreally be no purpose for anything,''she said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, March 4-6</NOTE></DOC>
