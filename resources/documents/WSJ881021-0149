The measure, which passed on a voice vote, was approved earlier by the Senate and is expected to be signed by President Reagan.    The continuing government investigation into Pentagon procurement fraud provided some of the impetus behind the legislation, which would allow prosecutors to seek as much as $10 million in fines from contractors that are convicted of the most serious fraud offenses.    Under current law, the maximum penalties for a single offense are $250,000 for an individual and $500,000 for a corporation.    Under the new measure, each act of fraud could carry a $1 million penalty and a 10-year prison term, with an overall cap of $10 million for a single defendant.    The Defense Department strongly backed a provision in the legislation that lengthens the statute of limitations in contract-fraud cases to seven years from five years. The bill also authorizes an additional $8 million for the Justice Department to beef up its anti-fraud efforts with more U.S. attorneys.    &quot;The extra personnel is needed,&quot; said Victoria Toensing, a Washington attorney who formerly supervised the Justice Department's anti-fraud unit and testified in favor of most provisions of the legislation.    The measure includes a provision giving greater job protection to people who alert the government of contracting fraud. And the bill would severely limit the ability of contractors to charge off their legal fees to the government as part of overhead costs. </TEXT></DOC>
