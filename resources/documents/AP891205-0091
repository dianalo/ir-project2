The world's largest computer company said it would set aside$2.3 billion from its pre-tax earnings for the fourth-quarter tocover costs of employee buyouts and restructuring. IBM said itwould reduce its staff by limiting hiring and offering incentivesto employees to quit or retire early.   The company did not announce any closings of facilities and JohnAkers, the chairman and chief executive, said he did not expect any.   IBM also announced a program to buy back up to $4 billion of itsown stock, which has lost more than a third of its value since its1987 peak.   With the company cost-cutting to improve profitability, IBM'sstock rose $2 a share to $101.25 at midday today on the New YorkStock Exchange after a $2.12{ a share rise on Monday, whenspeculation intensified that the company planned to cut jobs.   The stock's peak price was $175.87{ in August 1987.   IBM expanded dramatically in the early 1980s but has beencutting back since 1985, when it became apparent that theindustry's rapid 15 percent annual growth was slowing.   IBM said its growth overseas was strong, but the U.S. businessstill was growing more slowly than desired.   ``The actions we are describing today underscore our ongoingresolve to make IBM the most competitive information processingbusiness in an industry that continues to grow,'' Akers said in astatement.   IBM has a 40-year tradition of no layoffs. In a meeting todaywith securities analysts, Akers said the company intended to keepthat tradition because it helped the company maintain ahigh-quality, flexible and dedicated workforce.   He added, ``It's impossible to guarantee for all time fullemployment under any and all circumstances.''   The company said its $4 billion stock buyback, in combinationwith a $1 billion buyback authorized in October, if completed wouldbring total repurchases since mid-1986 to more than $10.5 billion.That amounts to about 15 percent of the shares outstanding at thattime _ possibly the biggest repurchase program ever undertaken.   The job cuts are intended to reduce the company's U.S. workforceto 206,000 by the end of 1990, a reduction of more than 37,000 from1985 levels.   The $2.3 billion pre-tax charge against fourth-quarter earningsbreaks down as follows:   _$500 million for separation payments to people leaving thecompany.   _$500 million for accounting changes to speed up the way IBMlogs its payment for software and technology investments.   _$1.3 billion for restructuring, including consolidations,capacity reductions and cuts in the valuation of specialinvestments such as share ownership in other companies.</TEXT></DOC>
