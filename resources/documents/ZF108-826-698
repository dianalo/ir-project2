Gilbert, a computer specialist in NCSL's computer security planninggroup, is responsible for the software testing program.andP;  Gilbert said shereceives about six calls per week from agencies asking for advice on whatkinds of analysis tools to buy or how to develop their own programs.andM;&quot;One of the problems with so many packages on the market is that there islittle understanding of what products to choose,&quot; Gilbert said.andP;  &quot;Agenciesneed to know which one is best for their needs rather than finding outthrough trial and error.andP;  We want to define the essential elements so whenagencies look at these toosl they know which ones to eliminate.&quot;andM;Beflore agencies start shopping for automated tools, Gilbert said they mustfirst determine what it is they want to accomplish.andP;  Some packages calculatecosts for certain security features and project potential losses for variousproblems, while others provide qualitative analysis.andM;However, Gilbert warned that automated tools have no use unless theycomplement an agency's own security policies.andM;&quot;You have to define your own requirements and know what it is you expect asan end product,&quot; Gilbert said.andM;Gilbert examines both commercial and agency risk analysis tools under avariety of scenarios.andP;  The tests are done on a PC, and Gilbert checks to seehow the software helps users identify and evaluate internal controls, accesscontrols, audit trails, contingency plans and other security features.andM;Gilbert then develops a checklist of each too's characteristics listing themethodology, hardware requirements, operating system, user interface anddocumentation and training.andM;Thus far Gilbert has tested about 20 software packages including an Air Forceprogram and an Energy Department risk assessment manual.andP;  the testing isvoluntary, and there is no charge to vendors.andP;  Agency employees also canvisit the lab to examine products.andP;  NCSL provides a list of each package'scapabilities, but the lab does not rate or endorse any products.andM;Although software can support security evaluations, Gilbert said, the lab wasestablished to help agencies develop comprehensive risk analysis managementprograms.andP;  Agencies should not rely solely on automated tools, she said.andM;&quot;The automated tools do not address all agency needs, so we began to identifythe methods necessary to do a good risk analysis&quot; Gilbert said.andP;  &quot;Our primarygoal is to issue guidance on risk management techniques.andP;  W want to issue aframework that describes the essentials of risk analysis which can then beused by developers and agencies to set automated tools.&quot;andM;Gilber said NCSL officials plan to issue a Federal Information ProcessingStandard publication next year on building risk analysis models.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
