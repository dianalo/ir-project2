The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which reviewed theboard of trade's performance from July 1987 to April 1988, said theboard's routine computer surveillance program was ``not properlytailored to efficiently identify potential trading abuses.''   ``The (commission staff) believes that significant modificationsto the (surveillance) program are necessary for ... an effective ...system,'' the report said. It called on the exchange to expand thenumber of futures contracts reviewed per month, the amount oftrading activity examined each day and the number of tradersanalyzed.   A similar criticism was levied by the agency in its last reviewof the board of trade in 1986, but received little public attention.However, the latest report comes as a federal grand jury in Chicagois reviewing evidence from a two-year FBI undercover investigationof widespread alleged abuses at the board of trade and the ChicagoMercantile Exchange.   In reaction to the FBI probe, Congress is closely scrutinizingboth the Chicago markets and the commission's oversight of them. Theagency's legislative authorization expires Sept. 30 and Congress maydemand reforms before passing it.   The commission praised the board of trade on several points,saying it effectively collects information on and monitors generalmarket activity, it thoroughly investigates specific complaints fromcustomers or referrals from other traders and it levies appropriatepunishments for violations.   However, the agency said ``the exchange did not interview allindividuals who might have had knowledge of questionable activity''and it noted ``undue delays in completing investigations.''   ``The completion of numerous ... investigations was undulydelayed because of the lack of timely supervisory review,'' thereport said.   In response to the report, board of trade officials noted thatthe exchange's directors voted earlier this month to spend $1million this year to improve the exchange's computerized tradereconstruction system, which is designed to catch improper trades.   Officials estimated then that the system was about 90 percenteffective in catching abuses. They said the upgrade would increasethe system's effectiveness to 100 percent.   They also noted that over the past three years the exchange hasexpanded its investigative office by 75 percent.   ``We are always looking for constructive criticism about our ruleenforcement record from the CFTC,'' Board of Trade President ThomasR. Donovan said in a statement.   The CFTC report took note of the improvements, but said, ``It istoo soon to evaluate the changes.''   Meanwhile, Reps. Glenn English, D-Okla., and Thomas Coleman,R-Mo., on Tuesday asked the CFTC to delay approving new futurescontracts until the completion of a House Agriculture Committeereview of the agency and the FBI probe.   Eric Hauser, an aide to English, who is in charge of thecommittee's review, said the request would affect three activeapplications for new foreign exchange futures contracts filed by theChicago Mercantile Exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
