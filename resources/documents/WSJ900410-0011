The lower bonuses reflect lower earnings in 1989, withGM's net income off 13% and Ford's down 28%, after awrite-off from the sale of its steel subsidiary. Bothcompanies have changed their bonus programs over the past fewyears to tie compensation more closely to achievement oflong-range goals. Last year was the second in a row thatFord's highest officials saw their bonuses decline fromyear-earlier levels.</LP><TEXT>   Still, recently retired Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersenonce again outearned his GM peer, Roger B. Smith, in totalcompensation: Mr. Petersen received nearly $6.6 million toMr. Smith's $2.5 million. Some $3.5 million of Mr. Petersen'scompensation total came from the exercise of stock options;Mr. Smith didn't exercise any stock options in 1989.   The $1,530,874 salary Mr. Petersen received last yearrepresented a 34% increase from his 1988 salary. But his$1,518,800 in 1989 supplemental compensation -- or bonus --was 31% less than he pulled down a year earlier.   Meanwhile, Mr. Smith received $1,092,000 in salary in1989, an 11% increase from $983,000 in 1988, while his 1989bonus fell about 7% to $1.4 million from $1.5 million in1988.   &quot;The big buck syndrome in Detroit is a disease that'sstill in need of a cure,&quot; complained United Auto Workersunion officials. GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp. all facedifficult contract negotiations with the UAW this summer. Theunion has already criticized reduced profit-sharing paymentsto hourly workers at GM and Ford.   Chrysler, which will disclose its proxy statement Friday,didn't pay any bonuses to its top managers because it didn'tmake enough money to pay profit sharing to its hourlyworkers. The agreement that triggered Chrysler's move wasnegotiated with the union in 1988. &quot;GM and Ford can expect tohear more from us on this subject during forthcoming contracttalks,&quot; the UAW leaders said.   Harold A. Poling, Ford's chairman since the Feb. 28retirement of Mr. Petersen, outearned his counterpart, RobertC. Stempel, currently GM's president and the man slated tosucceed Mr. Smith on Aug. 1. Mr. Poling, who was Ford's vicechairman last year, received $2,934,688 in total compensationfor 1989, with his salary rising 25% to $1,188,594. His bonusfell 40% however, to $960,000.   Total compensation for Mr. Stempel rose 12.5% to$2,096,820 in 1989, which included a 15% increase in salaryto $725,000 and a 5% decline in bonus payments to $1,050,000.Mr. Poling received $786,094 from the exercise of stockoptions; Mr. Stempel received $321,820.   Ford also disclosed in its proxy statement a new boardpolicy that automatically defers the portion of executivebonuses that exceed $600,000 or 150% of base salary,whichever is greater. The excess is converted into rights tocommon stock that can't be claimed until after the executivesturn 62 or 18 months after they leave the company. Theexecutives also can lose the rights by, among other things,immediately going to work for a competitor.   As previously reported, Mr. Petersen isn't standing forre-election as a director. Former Chairman Philip Caldwell,who has reached the mandatory retirement age of 70, alsoisn't up for re-election.   In its proxy statement, GM said it is asking holders toapprove a plan that would increase to 500 million from 190million the number of authorized Class E shares, whichreflect a dividend interest in GM's Electronic Data Systemscomputer services unit. The company said it hasn't anyimmediate plans to issue additional Class E shares butbelieves the authorization increase &quot;is needed to provideflexibility for possible future actions such as additionalstock dividends, splits or acquisitions.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
