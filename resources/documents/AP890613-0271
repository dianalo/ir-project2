On Monday, Britain's Civil Aviation Authority grounded all 12Boeing 737-400s operated by British airlines after two of the jetsexperienced engine failure. On Tuesday, West German officialsordered that the engines be checked on the four 737-400 jets used inthat country.   The jets all are powered by by CFM56-3C engines, made by CFMInternational, a consortium of SNECMA of France and General ElectricCo. of the United States.   The Federal Aviation Administration was preparing anairworthiness directive instructing U.S. airlines to inspect the fanblades on engines in their Boeing 737-400s and to operate them at alower power thrust, Dave Duff, an FAA spokesman in Seattle,confirmed Monday. That directive was expected to be issued bymid-week.   Recommendations from Boeing and the engine manufacturer includereplacing fan blades and lowering the maximum thrust to 22,000pounds from 23,500 pounds that current CFM56-3C engines provide, aBoeing statement said.   The recommendation affects 29 CFM56-3C-powered jets outside theUnited States and five in this country. All five of the U.S. jetsare operated by USAir, T. Craig Martin of Boeing said Tuesday.   Boeing's announcement was not made to try to head off theexpected FAA directive, Martin said.   ``We have been working very closely with the FAA as well as withCFM,'' Martin said.   ``The CFM56-3C engine problems result when fan blades break at avery high rpm, scattering parts into the engine,'' Martin said.   The engine failures on the British jets involved damage to fanblades. The same model engine and plane also were involved in afatal crash in January in Britain.   On Friday, a Dan-Air 737-400 carrying 100 charter passengers toMinorca returned to London's Gatwick airport after developing severevibration in one engine.   On Sunday, a British Midlands 737-400 flying from London'sHeathrow airport to Belfast, Northern Ireland, with 80 people aboardmade an emergency landing at East Midlands airport after a problemdeveloped in one engine.   In both cases, the airlines reported that turbofan blades hadbeen damaged.   Questions about the CFM56-3C engine arose in January after thecrash of a British Midlands Boeing 737-400 at East Midlands airportthat killed 47 people.   The pilot had reported that one engine failed in flight, butinvestigators later found the plane's good engine had been shut downbefore the emergency landing was attempted. The investigation hasnot been completed.</TEXT></DOC>
