(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Cappelletti, John Danilo; Rosenfeld, Azriel.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Three-dimensional images in medical imaging are usually made fromparallel serial section images obtained from tomographic scanners,which increases the importance of the development of 3D featuredetection techniques.andP;  Boundary detection and extraction in serialsection images of objects with smooth surfaces and sections thatare all connected and approximately circular are studied.andP;  Theboundary finding algorithm is intended to generate a series of 2Dboundaries that provide a 3D boundary of the object when stacked.andO;A graph search based method for following 2D boundaries in each ofthe sections is presented, and its performance is compared for 2Dand 3D gradient operators and for cost functions that omit thecircularity component and/or comparisons.andP;  Use of 3D gradientoperators is shown to reduce search effort and improve accuracy ofboundaries for noisy images.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Image ProcessingMedical DiagnosisThree-Dimensional GraphicsFeature MeasurementEdge DetectionAlgorithm AnalysisNew TechniqueTechnologyTheoretical Research.andO;Feature:   illustrationcharttable.andO;Caption:   Blur and noise conditions.
