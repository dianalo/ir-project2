ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A House subcommittee member raised thepossibility Monday of imposing criminal penalties againstscientists who deliberately falsify their research, but severalwhistleblowers protested that such a solution would be excessivelyharsh.   The suggestion of a federal statute making scientific fraud ormisconduct a criminal offense was made by Rep. John Conyers Jr.,D-Mich., at a hearing of the House Government Operationssubcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations.   ``Why are scientists in a different position from anyone elsewho acts against the public interest?'' demanded Conyers, who alsois a member of the House Judiciary Committee.   ``Your point is an excellent one, and it makes me squirm,''replied Walter Stewart, a nerve cell researcher at the NationalInstitutes of Health who is a part-time investigator of scientificmisconduct in the research community.   But Stewart and a colleague, Dr. Ned Feder, expressed concernthat the threat of criminal penalties might create a damagingclimate of fear among scientists.   Two private whistleblowers, Professor Robert L. Sprague of theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Dr. Jerome G.Jacobstein of the graduate hospital of the University ofPennsylvania at Philadelphia, both said Conyers' idea was ``goingtoo far.''   Sprague waged a nearly four-year effort to call attention toscientific fraud committed by Dr. Stephen Breuning, who used agrant from the National Institute of Mental Health for researchinto drug treatment of mentally retarded patients.   Jacobstein blew the whistle on Dr. Jeffrey S. Borer, acardiologist and professor at Cornell University Medical College,for allegedly inducing a medical student to make numerousmisrepresentations in a report of their scientific study.   Sprague expressed interest when the subcommittee chairman, Rep.Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., suggested that one solution might be to createan anti-fraud watchdog organization within the scientific community.   ``It is not a question of too many watchdogs,'' Weiss said. ``Weseem to have no watchdogs at all in this situation.''   Weiss complained that neither the National Institutes of Health,universities where research financed by NIH grants is conducted,nor the professional scientific societies has shown a willingnessto guard against fraudulent research.   ``You can't have it both ways,'' Weiss said, expressing sympathywith Conyers' suggestion for criminal penalties. ``We can't have acontinuation of flagrant abuses and say no one can be heldaccountable because it might hurt morale.''   Stewart agreed with Conyers that scientific fraud threatens``incredible harm and injury to the public,'' but expressedoptimism that scientists will find a way to police themselveswithout federal intervention.   Replied Conyers: ``The whole point of criminal laws is todeter.''   Jacobstein said extreme forms of scientific fraud, such aswholesale fabrication of research data, is ``fairly rare.'' But heestimated that 20 percent to 30 percent of research papers containunethically flawed results.   ``The whole climate just fosters this generally feeling thateveryone does it,'' he said.   Stewart and Feder, who testified jointly, said they have talkedto ``considerably more than 20 scientists who have allegedmisconduct to us privately,'' but have been reluctant to makeformal charges through the NIH bureaucracy.   ``Their reluctance strongly suggests to us that the reportedcases of misconduct represent only a small fraction of the total,''they said.   Based on questions raised by Stewart and Feder, the NIH hasformed a special committee to investigate allegations that researchdata was misrepresented in a paper published by Nobel laureateDavid Baltimore, director of the Whitehead Institute in Boston, andby Therza Imanishi-Kari of Tufts University.   Baltimore, who won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for research incellular biology, said last week that he welcomed the NIHinvestigation. Baltimore said he hoped it would silence Stewart andFeder, who he said had ``acted like a judge and jury'' in the case.</TEXT></DOC>
