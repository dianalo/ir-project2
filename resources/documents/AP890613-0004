Then look the other way when a killer virus takes hold andthe afflicted complain about cruel treatment and deficient medicalcare. That's the impact of AIDS in prison. ``Prisoners are regardedas ... people who don't matter. It's a double stigma for inmateswith AIDS,'' said Nick Fruedenberg, a New York expert on AIDScounseling and education. The second story in a three-part AP Extraseries, ``Medicine Behind Bars,'' addresses care and treatment ofinmates with AIDS.</TEXT><NOTE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</NOTE><NOTE>AP National Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>WETUMPKA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Carmen Harris, isolated with other femaleAlabama prisoners carrying the AIDS virus, feared she would bleed todeath in her cell.   Stitches from routine uterine surgery had torn open, but nurseson three shifts failed to answer her pleas for help in November1987, she said.   ``They was afraid of the blood. They was afraid of catching thevirus. They had a fear of the word AIDS,'' said Ms. Harris, whowaited 12 hours before she was taken to a hospital near Montgomery.   ``You're treated like an alien, like you had the plague,'' shesaid. ``I got sentenced for manslaughter. The judge could have justas well sentenced me to death row. It's like being punished for mycrime and my diagnosis.''   Behind prison walls, AIDS is a crackling health issue.   Some states isolate inmates who have the virus even if theyhaven't developed symptoms. Those in segregation consider it cruelconfinement to a new death row. Prison officials defend it as a wayto contain the virus and protect those infected from harm.   While arguments can be made for segregation, nothing excuses thefailure to provide medical care, inmates' advocates say. Yet prisonsaren't equipped to treat the long-term debilitating illnesseswrought by AIDS.   ``Those on the new death row are not getting appropriate medicalattention. They are being condemned to waste away,'' said BenjaminSchatz, director of the AIDS Civil Rights Project of the NationalGay Rights Advocates. ``They are treated as if infection indicatesthey have done something wrong.''   ``AIDS has made the job of providing prison health care moredifficult, more hazardous and more expensive,'' said Curtis Prout,director of the internship program at Harvard Medical School.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most commonly transmittedduring homosexual acts and the sharing of contaminated needles whileinjecting drugs, two behaviors common among prisoners.   In the most recent count last October, 3,136 AIDS cases had beendiagnosed among the U.S. prison population of more than 627,000,according to the National Institute of Justice. AIDS in prisonincreased 60 percent last year, as against a 76 percent jump in thegeneral population, which can pursue high-risk behaviors more freely.   Alabama and five other states _ California, Georgia, Nevada,Tennessee and Wyoming _ segregate prisoners who carry the HIV virusthat causes AIDS, whether or not they have the disease.   Prisoners with full-blown AIDS are segregated in 20 other states,and 14 states test or will soon start testing all incoming inmatesfor the disease.   Federal prisons randomly test 10 percent of incoming inmates andall those leaving the system. Those with AIDS or the virus are notisolated.   Mandatory mass screening and segregation of all HIV-positiveinmates is opposed by the National Commission on Correctional HealthCare, which sets voluntary standards for health care in prisons. Itfavors solutions such as education and changing behaviors that causeAIDS.   Alabama inmates who tested positive to the AIDS virus havecharged in a class action lawsuit that they receive poor medicalcare and cruel treatment. The federal trial began in March.   Suits are pending in two other states that segregate. Inmateswith AIDS in Connecticut say their medical care is grosslyinadequate. California prisoners assert that the level of theirmedical and psychiatric care is ``atrocious.''   ``They're treated like lepers. They might as well be wearing ascarlet letter. They're shunned, ostracized and stigmatized,'' saidAlexa Freeman, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union,which filed the Alabama suit.   ``There is no logic, no rational basis and no medical basis tothe (segregation) policy,'' said Robert Cohen, former medicaldirector at New York City's Rikers Island Prison and an expertmedical witness. ``It is only fear and discrimination which givesrise to such barbarous actions.''   Of the 12,000 inmates in Alabama, 138 have tested positive forHIV since 1987. All but eight are men.   Men are segregated at the Limestone Correctional Facility insideDorm 7, where even the exercise yard is cut off from the main yardby a 14-foot-high chain-link fence topped with razor wire.   The sense of doom is so heavy that inmates call it Thunder Dorm,recalling the futuristic city in ``Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,'' amovie about society's collapse after a nuclear holocaust.   Inmates eat with wooden ice cream sticks instead of forks andspoons. Meals come on color-coded trays. Their dirty laundry goesout in red plastic bags so it is washed separately.   They worship apart from other inmates and don't have equal accessto programs that would allow them to have jobs or earn early parole.   One inmate with the virus was forced to mop the halls behind himas he walked. Others were given surgical masks and made to cleantelephones with bleach or ammonia swabs after making calls.   ``The same hysteria on the streets is multiplied in prison,''said Alvin Bronstein of the ACLU.   Michael Marsh, 41, a thief, said life in Thunder Dorm featuresfights, knifings and high-risk sex among prisoners who figurethey're going to die anyway.   ``Guys would rather be killed here than die from AIDS. Theyhunger for death another way. Any other way. Something that would behonorable,'' Marsh said. ``It's like living in the valley of theshadow of death. If AIDS don't kill you, one of the guys might.''   Some inmates want to keep the HIV prisoners isolated, sayingthose infected would be killed ``as soon as they got into the yard.''   ``It's either we take them out or they take us out,'' saidStewart Hughey, 28, a rapist, who testified in favor of segregationin the Alabama case. ``If one of them gets his semen or blood on anopen cut, they just signed your death warrant.''   In New York state, where AIDS is the leading cause of death amonginmates, medical care is deficient, according to an 18-month studyreleased last year by the Correctional Association of New York.   Doctors were unfamiliar with AIDS treatment and detection, thestudy said. Since 1981, more than 500 prisoners have died of AIDS;in 25 percent of the cases, the disease was not diagnosed until anautopsy.   Prisoners with AIDS also have an unusually low survival rate, thereport said.   Inmates from New York City who got the disease from dirty needleshad a mean survival rate of 159 days, half that of those in theoutside community with similar backgrounds.   ``AIDS and prison is proving to be a devastating combination,''said Cathy Potler, author of the report. ``Imprisonment becomes avirtual death sentence.''</TEXT><NOTE>NEXT: Geriatric Inmates and Their Costly Health Problems</NOTE></DOC>
