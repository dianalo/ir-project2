Jesse Helms declaring ``garbage is garbage''regardless of the time of day.   By voice vote Tuesday, the Senate approved a Helms amendment toa pending appropriations bill directing the Federal CommunicationsCommission to end its ``safe harbor'' and giving it until Jan. 31,1989, to draft new regulations.   The overall legislation, appropriating $15 billion for theState, Justice and Commerce departments for the 1989 fiscal yearbeginning Oct. 1, will be sent to a conference with the House,which already has passed a version of the bill.   Helms, who said he acted in the interests of ``defending decentmoral values,'' asserted the FCC decision to permit adultbroadcasting after midnight violated the 1934 laws regulating theairwaves.   Helms, R-N.C., complained that broadcasters under the new FCCrules have been permitted to air programs which include``disgusting bestiality, sodomy and child sex.''   ``Garbage is garbage no matter what the time of day or night maybe,'' he told the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
