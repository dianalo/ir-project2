The $3,990 workstation, priced well below the typical $10,000 to $15,000 range, breaks a price barrier for workstations. Designed for a variety of uses, including manufacturing and distribution, the workstation represents Hewlett's biggest splash yet into the low-end workstation market, one of the industry's growth areas.    &quot;All workstation producers are involved in a race to see who can create lower and lower prices,&quot; said Peter Rogers, a computer analyst with Robertson, Stephens andamp; Co. &quot;Hewlett-Packard seems to have done a decent job of that.&quot; Mr. Rogers and other analysts expect Hewlett-Packard's move to lead to a round of price cutting over the next year that could intensify if the Japanese enter the workstation fray.    The Hewlett-Apollo workstation is two-thirds the U.S. list price of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s 3/80 workstation and about half the price of Digital Equipment Corp.'s DEC VAXstation 3100. Spokesmen for those two companies weren't immediately available for comment.    Although about the same price as many personal computers, the workstation is more powerful, has wider applications and has more sophisticated graphics than a higher-priced PC.    For Hewlett-Packard, the new workstation also gives the big computer maker some breathing room in digesting its recent acquisition of Apollo, which it bought in April for $476.4 million. The purchase vaulted Hewlett-Packard from a distant third to first in the hotly contested workstation market, but it also left Hewlett with the task of melding the two companies.    &quot;There is some truth to the talk that Hewlett-Packard has to move quickly to integrate Apollo and . . . in doing so give the customer a coherent set of signals,&quot; said Mr. Rogers. </TEXT></DOC>
