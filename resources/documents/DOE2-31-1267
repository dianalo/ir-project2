If the rate (%) of probable tumor spreadingwithin a certain stage is the same for both cancer sites, then the 5-yearsurvival rate for these sites is similar (or the same). If a tumor withina certain stage is equal to one third of its probable maximum spreading,the 5-year survival rate is approximately 85%; if it is equal to 1/2,the 5-year survival rate is approximately 60%; over 1/2 - approximately40-30%. If tumor involvement is complete, therapeutic efficacy is doubtful.It can be assumed that the above correlations established for 2 cancersites (the larynx and cervix uteri) have general significance and maybe applied to all cancer sites.</TEXT></DOC>
