At yesterday's closing price, purchase of the Petrie shares in public hands would cost nearly $400 million. Petrie closed at $21.25, up $5 a share, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Petrie Stores has about 46.8 million shares outstanding, of which Mr. Petrie holds 28.2 million.    In a statement, the 85-year-old Mr. Petrie, who also is president and chief executive officer, stressed that he hasn't yet decided to bid for the shares or determined a price for such a plan. Petrie Stores said a committee of directors, advised by an independent counsel, would evaluate any such proposal.    An offer at current prices would be relatively advantageous; Petrie Stores shares traded as high as $40 a share last year.    However, the company's operations, like those of other women's clothing retailers, have been hurt by a slump that began last year when women rejected the miniskirt. Petrie Stores recently reported that earnings from operations for the six months ended July 30 sank 47% to about $10.1 million.    Net income rose, however, because of a $57.1 million special gain stemming from a swap of debentures. In the second quarter, Petrie Stores swapped 14.2 million shares of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc. for substantially all of Petrie's 7.5% and 8% subordinated exchangeable debentures.    That swap took $350 million of debt off Petrie's books, which would provide room to finance the purchase of the rest of Petrie, noted Robert I. Roth, analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. And in contrast to some other retailers, Mr. Roth added, Petrie isn't vulnerable to a hostile bidder because of Mr. Petrie's controlling interest.    Kurt Barnard, publisher of the Retail Marketing Report in New York, said that &quot;until several years ago, Petrie was a hallmark of profitability, and then this stopped.&quot; Presumably, he said, Mr. Petrie would find it &quot;simpler and easier&quot; to operate Petrie Stores as a private company. The company couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. Barnard notes that Mr. Petrie, whom the analyst calls a &quot;crusty, irascible gentleman,&quot; runs the company with an iron fist. &quot;As far as I know, as far as anybody knows, it's a one-man operation,&quot; Mr. Barnard said.    Mr. Petrie, known for his philanthropy, is reported as a billionaire on Forbes magazine's October 1987 list of the 400 wealthiest individuals in the U.S.    At the company, he is aided by Hilda Kirschbaum Gerstein, 77-year-old vice chairman, Mr. Barnard said, but &quot;it's a well-kept secret&quot; if the company has a successor to Mr. Petrie in mind.    Petrie Stores operates about 1,600 stores under such names as Stuarts, Marianne, Jean Nicole and Petrie's. </TEXT></DOC>
