The case involves an April 1985 accident in which a foreman for Kenny Construction Co., Wheeling, Ill., died of asphyxiation after he was lowered in a cage into an unventilated shaft at an excavation site, according to OSHA.    The job-safety agency, which referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago, recommended that the company be prosecuted on charges of willful job-safety violations resulting in a worker death.    John Kenny Jr., the company's vice president, wouldn't comment on the action.    The agency already has cited the company for several alleged safety violations. The company has appealed the allegations, and the matter is pending before the OSHA review board.    The agency charged that Kenny Construction failed to take required safety precautions, resulting in its employees' entering an untested and unventilated shaft that contained too little oxygen. Other employees involved in the accident and in a rescue attempt recovered.    Several of the allegations involve what OSHA classified as &quot;willful&quot; violations, which the agency defines as an employer knowingly and purposely failing to comply with regulations or acting with indifference to the law. Under law, employers whose willful violation of federal health and safety laws results in a worker death can, upon conviction, be jailed for a maximum of six months and fined as much as $10,000, or both. </TEXT></DOC>
