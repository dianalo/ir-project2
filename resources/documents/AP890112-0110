(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Olympic diver Bruce Kimball was under asuicide watch in his jail cell today after pleading guilty tomanslaughter by drunken driving in the deaths of two teen-agers,authorities said.   ``He is scared to death of everything,'' said Maj. James Cook, asupervisor at the Hillsborough County Jail. Jailers checked onKimball every 15 minutes because of warnings from his lawyers thathe might be suicidal, authorities said.   A series of psychiatric tests showed he has been developingsuicidal tendencies, his lawyers said.   ``We told the judge we were seriously concerned about hisemotional state, and we told him of our concerns aboutself-destructive behavior,'' lawyer Frank Quesada told The TampaTribune.   On Wednesday, Kimball pleaded guilty to spare grieving relativeswho had just heard gruesome testimony on the accident, his fathersaid.   ``He did it for the right reasons,'' a sobbing Dick Kimball,father of the 1984 silver medalist, said outside the courtroom. ``Hedid not want to put the families of the kids through a horribletrial, or our family.''   The plea came Wednesday as testimony was just beginning in theCircuit Court trial on charges that the athlete drunkenly plowedinto a crowd of teen-agers with his sports car in suburban Brandonon Aug. 1. The late night crash injured six people. Kimball and histwo passengers escaped serious injury.   The case drew international attention when Kimball decided tocompete for a place on the 1988 Olympic diving team less than amonth after the crash. He failed to make the squad.   He pleaded guilty to two counts of driving under the influencemanslaughter and three of causing great bodily harm while drivingunder the influence. Kimball, who was jailed pending sentencing Jan.30, faces seven to 22 years in prison.   The plea surprised Assistant State Attorney John Skye, who wasabout to show jurors 43 color photographs of the crash scene.   ``Obviously the pictures were the most graphically unpleasantpart of this case,'' Skye said later.   Before the plea, Hillsborough County Sheriff's Deputy Karen Ovitttestified about the accident scene for the prosecution.   She described finding two bodies on the road ``in pieces'' andtwo of the injured teens, one bleeding badly and moaning, anotherbloody and screaming.   Killed in the accident were Robbie Bedell, 19, and Kevin Gossic,16. A 16-year-old who survived lost a leg, which was laterreattached.   Kimball met with attorneys from both sides in Judge Harry LeeCoe's chambers for half an hour, then emerged grim and glassy eyedto make his guilty plea.   ``Are you pleading guilty because you are guilty and for no otherreason?'' Coe asked.   ``Yes,'' replied Kimball, his voice barely audible.   Among the victims' relatives and friends at the trial wasBedell's fiancee, Dawn Berrios, who burst into tears outside thecourtroom later and said, ``I'm just glad it's over. I think we allknow the carnage that was out there.''   During opening arguments, defense attorney Lee Fugateacknowledged that Kimball had been drinking and speeding when hiscar hit the teen-agers on a dark dead-end street known as a hagoutfor teen-agers.   His car was traveling faster than 75 mph, and an hour after thecrash his blood-alcohol level was 0.2, twice the legal definition ofintoxication, prosecutors said.   Skye said another prosecution witness would have testified thatafter getting out of his car Kimball beat his fist on the ground andsaid, ``There go the Olympics.''   When Kimball went to Indianapolis to try out for the 1988 team,members of Mothers Against Drunk Driving and victims' friends andrelatives gathered there and staged a silent protest.   But after Wednesday's guilty plea, Dick Kimball, who coached hisson in diving at the University of Michigan, said: ``It was Bruce'sdecision. ``I am proud of him. I think it is something Bruce istrying to face and I'm really sorry.''</TEXT></DOC>
