Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted the director of theanti-drugs squads of the Islamic Revolutionary Committees as sayingThursday that 6,247 addicts, and 651 drug smugglers were arrestedin the crackdown.   The official, identified only as Yabu, said 350 pounds of drugswere confiscated in raids over the past month.   He warned that a massive follow-up operation would be launchedtoday to ``wipe out centers where addicts and smugglerscongregate.''   Yabu said 715 checkpoints were to be set up to catch traffickerstoday.   Iranians generally mock such operations, which are announced inadvance.   ``If I were a drug smuggler, do you think I would be stupidenough to transport my goods on a day when everybody is out lookingfor me?'' said an Iranian businessman in Tehran last week.   Iran has executed more than 1,500 alleged drug smugglers, andjailed over 70,000 so-called addicts since December 1988, accordingto official figures.   Possession of even small quantities of drugs, with intent tosell, carries a mandatory death sentence under Iran's laws.   Iranian opposition groups say the drug-related killings andarrests mask a crackdown on political opponents.   Amnesty International, the London-based human rightsorganization, said in report Tuesday that Iran executed 5,000political opponents in the past three years.   The Amnesty report coincided with a resolution passed by theUnited Nations Third Committee condemning human rights violationsin Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
