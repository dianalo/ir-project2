There were few signs of disruption from the strike by the flightattendants union at Continental, but Mary Jane Barry, president ofthe Eastern flight attendants' union local, predicted the walkoutwould grow.   ``Right now, they're still trying to get the word out,'' Ms.Barry said in Miami.   Continental's flight attendants voted in December to authorize astrike over wages and have been free to walk out since then, unionleader Carla Winkler said.   Ms. Barry said parent Texas Air Corp. has been trying to offsetEastern's strike, begun March 4 by its Machinists union and joinedby the pilots and flight attendants, by increasing Continental'sservice.   Only about 200 Eastern pilots, about half of them management, areflying, and Eastern is operating less than 10 percent of itspre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights.   Continental's executive vice president and chief operatingofficer, Lewis Jordan, said that as of midday Monday, only 35attendants were participating in that walkout and would be``permanently replaced.''   Ms. Barry, speaking at her union hall where walls were decoratedwith posters showing a Dracula figure representing Texas Airchairman Frank Lorenzo, said unions will announce new actions aimedat Continental on Tuesday. She declined to give details.   In another development Monday, the Air Line Pilots Associationcharged that Eastern pilots operating during the strike are omittingpre-flight aircraft inspections, an external visual check which mustbe done before departure.   ``That's an absolute lie perpetrated by the pilot's associationas another tactic to scare the public,'' said Eastern spokesmanRobin Matell. ``There's been no violation of any regulations andALPA knows that, but they don't care.''   Meanwhile, Trump said that because of the strike he no longerthought Eastern's Northeast shuttle service was worth the $365million he offered last year. He said he'd like to cut the price bymore than $125 million.   The deal has been awaiting final approval, and Eastern last weeksaid it would ask U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, where Easternfiled March 9 for Chapter 11 protection and bankruptcyreorganization, to expedite the sale to Trump.   In a letter to Lorenzo, Trump said: ``The shuttle has become anentirely different business in that its market share and customerbase may be lost for some time to come, if not forever.''   Eastern replied with an afternoon letter telling Trump it wasseeking other bids for the shuttle. The letter, which the airlineissued in a public statement, said Eastern has recently received``other offers unsolicited'' and invited Trump to re-submit a bid.   Eastern officials said passenger traffic on the 62 daily flightson the Boston-New York-Washington shuttle has improved steadilysince the first days of the strike, when some flights carried as fewas seven passengers. For one week it slashed weekday fares from $99to $49 one way and weekend fares from $69 to $12 to lure passengersback.   Eastern made another pitch Monday to lure shuttle passengers.Starting March 23, when the cut-rate weekday fares of $49 returns to$99, Eastern will offer an on-time guarantee on shuttle flights.   If the shuttle plane is more than five minutes pulling away fromthe gate, Eastern will greet the arriving passengers with refunds onthe spot or free tickets for other shuttle flights. The exceptionswould be delays caused by airport problems or severe weather.   A rival shuttle service operated by New York-based Pan Am Corp.has been flying with full passenger loads.   Pan Am has seen business on its shuttle service double since thestrike began, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners. The airline hasadded flights and introduced larger aircraft to accommodate theincreased demand, she said.   A Teamsters leader at Pan Am, meanwhile, said his union hasinitiated ``guerrilla warfare'' against Pan Am operations,especially its Northeast shuttle service.   William F. Genoese, director of the Teamsters' Airline Divisionand head of the Pan Am local, said the action was taken to show hisunion's support for the Eastern strike and to protest Pan Am'simposition of $35 million in pay cuts on its Teamsters last year.   The ``guerrilla'' tactics include deliberate diversion of baggageand cargo and cancellation of passengers' reservations, he said.   When the Continental strike deadline came at 10 a.m. EST, someflight attendants set up picket lines at the carrier's main Houstonhub, but flights appeared to be departing and arriving normally.Pickets also were reported at Newark, N.J., Los Angeles and Denver.   There are about 6,800 Continental flight attendants, but theunion has been without a contract since Continental's 1983 Chapter11 reorganization. The company says only 5 percent of its attendantsbelong to the union, and the union says 60 percent. Continental'spilots and machinists lost their unions in 1983.   Continental spokesman Dave Messing said the flight attendants'walkout is ``like an annual event.'' An Easter 1988 call for asickout failed to materialize, and ``there's no reason to believethis attempt will be any more successful,'' he said.   Messing said Continental operates about 1,400 flights dailyserving 120 cities in the United States and abroad.   The union says Continental flight attendants are paid $11,000 to$15,000 annually, 30 to 50 percent lower than their counterparts atother airlines.   But Jordan, the airline vice president, said Continental ispaying ``comparable industry rates.'' He added that the airline onJan. 1 implemented a $19 million wage and fringe benefit increase.   It was not immediately clear how many flight attendants walkedoff their jobs and how many were picketing on their days off.   In another development related to the Eastern strike, a federaljudge in Manhattan denied a request by unionized workers at four NewYork area commuter railroads to delay his order barring them fromhonoring Eastern picket lines.   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr., who signedpreliminary injunctions barring sympathy strikes at the four raillines late Friday, refused to temporarily delay them while theunions appealed.</TEXT></DOC>
