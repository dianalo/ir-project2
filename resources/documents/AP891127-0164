Richard Kusserow, inspector general at the Department of Healthand Human Services, said testers at these screenings frequentlydisregard basic rules of hygiene in collecting blood samples andoften are poorly trained to operate the cholesterol-measuringdevices.   ``I do not think it is conducive to good medical benefit to havein this carnival-like atmosphere untrained people engaging in aprocedure which has some risk to public health from infection,'' hetold a House subcommittee.   He added that people who are tested ``are going to try to dependon these results, and the results, in fact, are not very accurate.''   Kusserow said he is concerned that public cholesterol screeningsare growing in popularity and that they are often used byentrepreneurs as a marketing strategy to promote products or bystores to increase traffic.   The inspector general said in an interview that his office isconducting a criminal investigation into ``several scams'' in whichscreeners unnecessarily refer Medicare and Medicaid recipients tophysicians for follow-up tests.   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the House Small Businesssubcommittee on regulation and business opportunities, said thescams involved screeners' rigging cholesterol-measuring devices sothey showed higher than true levels.   Both declined to discuss the investigation further.   The investigation grew out of a study conducted by the inspectorgeneral's office at the request of Wyden as part of his panel'scontinuing inquiry into unregulated medical testing.   Kusserow's report, released at Monday's hearing, said demand forscreening is growing because of greater public awareness of thelink between high cholesterol and heart disease.   Kusserow said he could not estimate accurately the number ofscreenings that are conducted yearly at shopping malls, pharmacies,health clubs, village halls and a variety of other public settings.But he called it a ``growth industry'' and said at least 10 millionpeople were tested this way in 1988.   The inspector general's investigators, who participated in 71screenings as part of the study, often had a variety of healthconcerns, including testers who collected blood, usually by afinger prick, and also handled money but wore no gloves and did notdisinfect between collections, he said.   Kusserow said these conditions raise the risk, both for testersand those being tested, of infection from blood-borne diseases,including AIDS and hepatitis.   ``The likelihood is not that great,'' he said, adding that heknew of no case in which disease has been spread through contact atscreenings. ``But I don't know if you want to be the 50th in linethat day'' when proper hygiene is not being followed, he said.``You're just asking for trouble.''   According to their findings, guidelines issued by the NationalCholesterol Education Program, a consortium of organizationscoordinated by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, wereusually not followed, he said.   Often screenings held in crowded shopping centers or stores werefrenzied and 42 percent of them were staffed by just one person.   Investigatores found that testers had little training and oftenno medical background, he said. The portable analyzers used atscreenings are accurate when used properly, he added, but if notcalibrated or operated correctly, they often yield innacurateresults.   Also, nearly 60 percent of the investigators whose blood wasdrawn with a finger prick had their fingers squeezed or ``milked,''which can dilute the sample with material from between the cellsand give a lower than true result.   Dr. Russell Luepker of the University of Minnesota testifiedthat a study he conducted last year at several Minnesota screeningsfound inaccurate results as high as 27 percent of the time at onesite. Most often, he said, the inaccurate result was lower than thetrue level.   Wyden said his concern was that people ``can be lulled into afalse sense of security. They may not see their doctors; they maynot change their diets, and they may not exercise. Over time, notknowing that they're in the danger zone could cost us our healthand even our lives.''   Kusserow's study did not measure the accuracy of testings, butone of his investigators, Barbara Butz, who directed the project,said she was tested five times, with the results ranging from 195to 243 milligrams per deciliter. A reading of 200 is considered tobe the desirable level, 200-239 borderline high blood cholesteroland over 240 a high level.   Currently, no federal regulations govern public cholesterolscreenings and state regulation is scattered and varied. Kusserowsaid 16 states have laws on their books, but that regulations infour of them have not been implemented.   A 1988 federal law brings all clinical laboratories underfederal regulation on Jan. 1, 1990. The Health Care FinancingAdministration is drafting regulations to implement the law.   The law, however, provides that some medical testing may beexempt from its provisions. The inspector general recommended thatpublic screenings be included in the regulations because ``federalregulation ... is clearly called for in order to safeguard thepublic.''</TEXT></DOC>
