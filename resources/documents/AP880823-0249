In a surprise, Digital also said that 10 percent of its revenue_ almost $1 billion _ came from computer systems that primarily usethe Ultrix operating system.   Digital, the No. 2 computer maker behind International BusinessMachines Corp., also announced new software for hooking computersof different makes together in networks.   Digital's Ultrix is a base layer of software that allowscustomers to run the same programs on a variety of differentcomputers. It is a version of the Unix software created by AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co.   Digital said its new Ultrix is the first that complies with allindustry standards and specifications, including the ones announcedMonday by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.   The new version of Ultrix, called Ultrix-32 Version 3, ranges inprice from $2,100 to $56,000.   Digital until last year had been reluctant to give wholeheartedsupport to Ultrix, preferring that customers use its own VMSsoftware, which only works on Digital computers.   ``What Digital is recognizing is that they will have to meet theuser demand for open systems and they are prepared to put money andorganizational commitment behind that,'' said Nina Lytton, ananalyst with the Yankee Group.   Digital said the new Ultrix software is applicable toengineering computing, scientific research, government agencies,and aerospace, automotive and oil industries.   ``I think we're responding to a marketplace change in demand,''said Don McInnis, Digital's vice president for engineering systems.``More and more customers are interested in open operating systemsand we'll be responsive to that.''   Digital also played a role in founding the $100 million OpenSoftware Foundation, which announced Monday it would set upheadquarters in Cambridge. Digital, IBM, Hewlett-Packard Co. andfour other big computer makers formed the consortium to develop asoftware operating system that no single company would control.   Industry analysts viewed the project as a move by those computermakers against ATandamp;T and its partner, Sun Microsystems Inc., whichtogether controlled the popular Unix operating system.   Digital in September 1987 reorganized its marketing structure toinclude operating systems and in December appointed two vicepresidents responsible for Ultrix, marking a major change inemphasis.   At the news conference, Digital said revenue from computers,software and services based on its Ultrix operating system nowaccounts for about 10 percent of total revenue. Digital last yearreported revenues of $9.39 billion.   ``It seems to have been a well-kept secret on the outside,''independent analyst Sonny Monosson said. ``I never realized it wasso high.''</TEXT></DOC>
