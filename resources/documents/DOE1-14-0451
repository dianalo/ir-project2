<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-14-0451 </DOCNO><TEXT>Raman scattering of cubic boron nitride ({beta}BN) used in the form ofcrystal powders or small single crystals was studied by the aid of aHe-Cd laser for exciting. The refined energy values of transverse-opticand longitudinal-optic phonons were obtained. The presence of the lowfrequency lines at 148.3 and 187.5 cm/sup -1/ in some spectra of {beta}BNcan be accounted for by the emergence of local oscillation modes dueto impurity-defect complexes in the lattice.</TEXT></DOC>
