In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, United Education closed at $4.625 a share, up 37.5 cents.    The settlement is part of an agreement with BankAmerica Corp.'s Bank of America unit, the trustee of bonds issued by the California Student Loan Finance Corp., which owns the federally and state-guaranteed student loans. Under the agreement, Bank of America will purchase the student-loan servicing assets of United Education for their book value -- which United Education estimates at between $1.5 million and $2 million -- and hire another company to service the loans.    United Education will pay Bank of America $2 million within 18 months to release the company from any liabilities under its loan-servicing agreement.    United Education in September disclosed that federal auditors had found &quot;flaws&quot; in its compliance with federal regulations regarding servicing student loans. An article in Barron's magazine in late August discussed federal auditors' examinations of whether United Education followed proper procedures before declaring thousands of loans in default and collecting insurance on them. The company had said the review involved &quot;apparent computer-related servicing problems.&quot;    A United Education shareholder filed suit in August alleging fraud and negligent misrepresentation by the company and certain of its officers in connection with the loan-servicing business.    United Education will post a one-time, $7.5 million write-off or reserve for the fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 31 from the discontinuation of its student-loan servicing operations, resulting in a &quot;substantial non-recurring loss&quot; for the quarter. However, the company said it could recover as much as $5 million through certain insurance claims. It said it expects to be profitable again in the fourth quarter.    The company will continue to operate its technical-training schools and home-study services, and provide educational software. </TEXT></DOC>
