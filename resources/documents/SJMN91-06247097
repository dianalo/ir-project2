Perhaps even more important, observers say, the drop in yieldson interest-bearing investments makes dividends on stocks look a lot lessskimpy.;   As of mid-August, the Dow Jones industrial average's yield stood at3.08 percent, down about one full percentage point from its levels in Octoberas stocks were just starting their present rally.;   But the yield on Barron'sindex of top-grade corporate bonds also has fallen since then, from just under9.5 percent to a little more than 8.5 percent. So the spread between the twohas barely widened at all.;   &quot;On that basis,&quot; said Martin Zweig in hisinvestment advisory letter, The Zweig Forecast, &quot;even though dividendscurrently yield not much above 3 percent, stocks don't look expensive.;   &quot;Thedilemma is what to do with cash when interest rates are low and falling,&quot;Zweig added. &quot;A friend called me just today wanting to invest money in stocksbecause a CD was coming due and the reinvestment rate on it was unappetizing.;  &quot;That's just one reason why the market does well when rates are falling,even when it is otherwise 'overvalued.' &quot;;   It would be dangerous, analystsquickly add, to expect this force to keep working indefinitely in the market'sfavor.;   The positive flow might well run dry very quickly if investorsconcluded the economy wasn't responding at all to the credit-easingministrations of the Federal Reserve.;   In an extreme case, falling interestrates were no help in keeping the stock market from collapsing in 1929-'32, asthe Great Depression set in.;   Conversely, enthusiasm for stocks might berestrained in a strong business recovery if interest rates started climbingeven as corporate profits perked up.;   &quot;This shift from fixed-incomeinstruments into equities is primarily responsible for boosting the stockmarket to its current valuation level,&quot; said Thom Brown at the Philadelphiainvestment firm of Rutherford, Brown andamp; Catherwood Inc.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910903  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  12E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  481  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, September 3, 199100247097,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
