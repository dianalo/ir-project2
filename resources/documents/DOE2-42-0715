In particular, it contains a quadratic component which accountsfor the second-harmonic (SH) generation observed in these materials atall the temperatures below T/sub c/. SH spectra of oxide superconductorsdisplay several spin-glass features. It is also suggested that SH datacan be conveniently used for a characterization of high-T/sub c/ superconductors.</TEXT></DOC>
