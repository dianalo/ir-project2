Other actionsEPA is taking on other portions of the submittal are described elsewherein today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On February 24, 1984, the EPA Region 6 Regional Administrator sent theGovernor of Texas a formal notice for a revision to the ozone (O<T2>3</T2>) SIP for Dallas and Tarant Counties, Texas. Texas submitteda revision for Dallas and Tarrant Counties in several parts in 1985 and1986. That revision did not provide for sufficient VOC emission reductionsto demonstrate timely attainment of the O<T2>3</T2> National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). EPA, therefore,proposed to find that Texas had failed to respond adequately to the 1984SIP call, and hence proposed sanctions on July 14, 1987. The reader isreferred to EPA's proposed action discussed elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>.The Texas Air Control Board (TACB) submitted an additional revision inDecember 1987 referred to as the Post-82 Interim SIP. The anti-tamperingportion of the I/M program and certain TCMs found in the 1985, 1986, and1987 revisions are approvable by EPA. EPA will approve these regulationsbecause they assist in further control of VOC emissions.1. I/M RequirementsThe July 14, 1987, notice proposed to approve the parameter I/M programSIP revision if certain conditions were fulfilled. The notice also describedthe details of the program. On December 21, 1987, the State of Texas metthe certain conditions by submitting letters of commitment from the locallaw enforcement agencies, recordkeeping requirements, quality control commitments,mechanic training and public information commitments, and the final rules.EPA is approving the anti-tampering portion of the I/M porgram as foundin the 1985, 1986 and 1987 revisions since it will strengthen the existingSIP.Elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register,</T4> EPA describes the commitments made by the Stateof Texas to expand the DFW I/M program to include an exhaust emissions(tailpipe) inspection program. EPA will review the entire expanded I/Mprogram for approvability upon completion of the commitments.2. Transportation Control Measures  The July 14, 1987, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice proposed approval of the TCMs submittedin the 1985 and 1986 SIP revisions for the Post-82 SIP call contingentupon documentation of the evaluation of the TCMs specified under section108(f) of the Clean Air Act. Texas submitted documentation in the 1987SIP revision that provided sufficient justification that additional TCMswere not feasible during the timeframe covered by the 1985 and 1986 Post-82SIP submittal, i.e., 1983 through 1987.  EPA is approving the TCMs which were proposed in the July 14, 1987, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice and the additional infeasibility documentationsubmitted in the 1987 submittal since these measures contribute towardthe reduction in VOCs and strengthen the existing SIP. The credit reductionfor TCMs in the 1985 and 1986 Post-82 SIP submittals was revised. However,the expansion and enhancement of the vehicle I/M program and the controlof gasoline vapor pressure associated with the Post-82 Interim SIP affectthe amount of credit each measure will provide for a given area. Thesecontrols will make the fleet more efficient and emit less pollutants, therebyreducing the amount of emission reduction attributed to TCMs.  In the 1987 SIP revision, Texas has submitted additional TCM commitmentsfor 1987 through 1992. The commitment to adopt additional TCMs is discussedelsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4>   The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.  Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by April 10, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements (See section 307(b)(2)).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52  </ITAG>Air pollution control, Ozone, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations,Incorporation by reference.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Sec. 110(a) and 301(a) of the Clean Air Act, as amended(42 U.S.C. 7410(a) and 7601(a)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Incorporation by reference of the State Implementation Planfor the State of Texas was approved by the Director of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 1, 1982.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
