Dealers said the run on guns has been limited to the rapid-fireassault weapons, which have been the object of protest since agunman killed five schoolchildren in Stockton, Calif., in January.   The massacre, and publicity about the use of the guns by drugdealers, have spurred many city and state governments to considerbanning the guns. Several cities, particularly in California, haveapproved bans already.   On Wednesday, Colt Industries of Hartford, Conn., said it wassuspending sales to the public of its AR-15, a civilian version ofthe military's standard M-16 with a list price ranging from $739 to$1,359.   The company said the suspension was a voluntary reaction to theBush administration's temporary import ban on semiautomatics,announced Tuesday.   President Bush, who has generally sided with opponents of gunbans, said Thursday that any longterm restrictions on rapid-fireassault weapons must protect ``the rights of the legitimatesportsman'' as well as the lives of the nation's police officers.   A semiautomatic rifle fires a round each time the trigger ispressed. The government already bans sale of automatic weapons,which fire bullets as long as the trigger is pressed, but manysemiautomatic weapons can be readily converted to automatics.   Buyers of the weapons this week include gun enthusiasts worriedthat the stock soon would be depleted, and investors who have notedthe rapid runup in prices and are hoping that they can profit if itcontinues.   ``It's hysteria running wild,'' said Donald G. Davis, owner ofDon's Guns, a chain of three stores in Indianapolis. ``We couldhardly give one away prior to this mass hysteria, and now everyother customer that comes in here wants (one).''   ``My price has gone up from about $350 to $1,000 today, and whenI sell half of what I have left the price will go to $1,500,'' Davissaid Thursday.   At The Gun Gallery in Dallas, an AK-47, a type of gun used in theStockton shooting, cost $369 on Monday, $599 on Tuesday, and $799 onFriday. ``They don't care how much it costs,'' said owner PaulRosenberg.   In Georgia, Cubb said his customers included ``the people whoalways wanted one. They mortgaged the house again and come out andget one. Then there's the investor, who thinks, `If I get one todayfor $600, it will be worth $1,200 tomorrow.'''   ``The white-collar workers, the ones that drive the BMW's and theMercedes, they think it's an investment, just like the Rolex watchthey wear on their arm,'' Cubb said.   A man who answered the phone at the Sandy Trading Post in Sandy,Ore., where Patrick Purdy bought the AK-47 he used in the Stocktonschoolyard shootings, said the store was not experiencing a run onthe rifles. He also said sales of other guns had not increased.However, when asked for his name, he hung up.   In California, where a gun-ban bill passed the state Assemblythis week and a similar one passed the Senate last week, unhappy gunowners announced plans for a petition drive seeking the recall ofthe senator and assemblyman who sponsored the bills.   ``It (the ban) is simply being ramrodded through withoutconsidering their constituents' true feelings,'' said Ray Hickman ofthe 500-member Liberty Coalition of the San Fernando Valley.   ``I will not be intimidated by recall threats from these Rambogun groups,'' countered Sen. David Roberti, sponsor of the Senatebill.   Interest in the guns has been on the increase since theCalifornia shootings, but dealers said it was Bush's announcementTuesday of the temporary import ban, coupled with Colt's halt inAR-15 sales, that really spurred sales.   In Indianapolis, Davis estimated Thursday that has about 30 leftin stock at his three stores. ``If I could find 1,000 today inAmerica I would buy them all,'' he said. ``We'll be out for sure bySaturday.''   He had strong criticism for Colt for halting the AR-15 sales, andvowed never to sell them again if Colt changes its mind. ``We feelall they're doing is making love to the American public and lendingthemselves to this hysteria,'' Davis said.   Roy Furbeck, owner of Furbeck's Gun Shop in Chatham, Ill., saidhe doesn't sell the assault rifles because ``I don't think there's asporting use for them,'' but he's gotten a few calls about them.   ``People are trying to scalp them,'' he said. ``People have toldme that. They'll get whatever the traffic will bear.''</TEXT></DOC>
