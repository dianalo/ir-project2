No further details were available on the talks in Islamabad. Asimilar meeting was held earlier this year in Bonn, West Germany.   Representatives of other rebel groups that belong to a loose andoften fractured guerrilla alliance denied talks were held Sunday.The Soviet ambassador in Islamabad, Vladimir Vakunin, refused tocomment on the reports.   The meeting was first reported by Afghanistan's official RadioKabul, which said the talks were held with Afghan ``opposition,'' areference to the Moslem insurgents. The meeting was confirmed by anofficial with the Jamiat-e-Islami guerrilla group in Peshawar, whospoke by telephone on condition of anonymity.   Tass said the meeting ``between representatives of the SovietEmbassy in Pakistan and the Afghan armed opposition forces''discussed the return of Soviet prisoners.   Hamid Gailani, spokesman for the National Islamic Front ofAfghanistan guerrilla group said: ``There has been no suchcontact.'' He said Afghan officials ``have been lying for the past10 years so why not about this, too?''   A denial also came from the Afghan news agency, a rebelinformation center operated by members of the Hezb-e-Islamiguerrilla group.   Earlier this year, Hezb-e-Islami representatives met Sovietofficials in Bonn to discuss a prisoner-exchange program.   The two sides agreed to exchange one Soviet soldier for 25rebels. However, the rebels abandoned the prisoner exchange afterthe United Nations negotiated an accord on April 15 in Geneva thatcalls for the withdrawal of all Soviet troops. Rebels say noprisoners were ever exchanged.   Also Sunday, Moslem guerrillas said they regained control of astrategic border post after a week of fighting along a highway thatserves as their supply route from Pakistan.   There was no independent confirmation of the guerrilla claim.   In the latest round of battles that ended Saturday, theU.S.-supported insurgents raided several Afghan government postsalong the road linking Pakistan with the eastern Afghan city ofJalalabad, said Fazle Akbar, director of the pro-rebel AfghanInformation and Documentation Center.   He said the rebels gained control of the border post at Torkhamas well as a 20-mile stretch of road, Akbar said.   The battle for control of the highway and its military postsbegan Nov. 2, when Moslem insurgents claimed victory at Torkham andsaid they would keep the road closed until the city of Jalalabad wasin their control.   Within two weeks, Soviet troops were flown to Jalalabad fromKabul and made a sweep of the highway, recapturing Torkham, Westernand rebel sources said.   In the latest battle for Torkham last week, about 200 Afghansoldiers defected or surrendered, said Wasil Noor, spokesman for theseven-party Afghan Guerrilla Alliance headquartered in Pakistan'sborder city of Peshawar.   Akbar said two Soviet-made surface-to-surface missiles hit theTorkham area Saturday. There were no immediate reports of damage orcasualties.   The Soviet Union, which earlier this month sent more missiles andMiG fighter jets into Afghanistan, have claimed that stepped-upattacks by guerrillas made it necessary to upgrade Kabul's arsenal.   The Soviets, who intervened in Afghanistan in 1979 in support ofthe government in Kabul, agreed to withdraw an estimated 100,000troops in accordance with the U.N.-negotiated agreement.   Half the Soviets troops left in August and the remaining soldierswere to be pulled out by Feb. 15.   The Soviets recently suspended the troop withdrawal, althoughthey have promised to meet the February deadline. The Soviets haverepeatedly charged that Pakistan and the United States continue toarm the insurgents.   Pakistan and Afghanistan pledged to refrain from intervention ineach other's internal affairs when they signed the Geneva accord.The United States and the Soviet Union signed the accord asguarantors.</TEXT></DOC>
