The conditionsunder which these are supplied determine the quality of the production.Among these greenhouse heating always poses problems, both technicaland economic. In search of efficiency, ever more essential, greenhousegrowers are turning to systems enabling a higher production at lowercost. The electric heat pump, supplied with water from the shallow aquifer,combined with low temperature heat emitters, optimizes ideal greenhousegrowing conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
