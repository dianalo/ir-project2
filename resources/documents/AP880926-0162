The proceedings are in theirfourth week.   Churbanov, 51, is being tried with eight others in a case thatis expected to last another month. He is charged with acceptinghundreds of thousands of rubles in bribes from officials in therepublic of Uzbekistan, and could be sentenced to death by firingsquad.   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Churbanov testifiedthat an Uzbekistan Communist Party official named Umarov delivereda briefcase to his hotel room once, telling him it was a presentfrom Uzbekistan party leader Sharaf Rashidov.   ``When If opened it I found 100,000 or 130,000 rubles,'' Tassquoted Churbanov as saying. ``I wanted to return the money, but towhom?

Churbanov married Brezhnev's daughter, Galina, and worked in theInterior Ministry under Brezhnev's close associate, NikolaiShchelokov.   He pleaded guilty to abusing his office, but innocent toaccepting bribes.   Tass said Churbanov also testified that Interior Ministryofficials misled him into believing it was legal for him to useministry resources to build a cellar for his country house.   ``Naturally, when such explanations came from the former firstdeputy minister of internal affairs whose job it was to know thelaw, the audience could not help smiling,'' Tass said.   Churbanov's trial is the centerpiece of a campaign against thelegacy of Brezhnev, whose 18-year rule now is characterized in theSoviet Union as a time of corruption and stagnation.</TEXT></DOC>
