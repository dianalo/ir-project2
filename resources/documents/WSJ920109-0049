Fialka   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/09/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><MS>TECHNOLOGY (TEC)</MS><IN>AEROSPACE (ARO)</IN><GV>DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)</GV><RE>IRAQ (IZ)MIDDLE EAST (ML)NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- A private analysis of the U.S. bombing raidsduring the war against Iraq concluded that American militarycommanders greatly exaggerated the effect of attacks usingtechnologically advanced weapons on targets in Baghdad.   After spending two months examining 205 of the 800non-battlefield targets bombed in raids on Iraq, the analyst,William M. Arkin, concluded that the Baghdad air strikes werea &quot;high-tech conceit.&quot; A former U.S. Army intelligenceanalyst who directs military research for the environmentalorganization Greenpeace, Mr. Arkin said the raids in northernIraq had little to do with the defeat of the Iraqi army inthe south.</LP><TEXT>   While the attacks by Stealth fighter-bombers and Tomahawkmissiles were touted constantly in the briefers' version ofthe air war and in Pentagon budgets, the real destruction ofIraq's military capability came from raids by aging B-52s onthe Iraqi army in the south, said Mr. Arkin. Those raids, henoted, were kept largely secret during the war.   &quot;There was no connection between the air war in the northand the war in the south,&quot; he said at a press conference. Headded that the Iraqi army had little use during the war forthe civilian power system or the telephone system, both ofwhich were bombed extensively in the north.   Mr. Arkin said that many of the impressions given U.S.television viewers by Pentagon briefers in Riyadh, SaudiArabia, and Washington were misleading. Among the examples hecited was the strike on a downtown building housing Iraq'stelephone-switching center. Videotapes taken during the firstnight of the war showed a direct hit on the building's roof,and briefers suggested that the facility was destroyed. Butaccording to Mr. Arkin, the electronic-switching equipmentand other gear in the building had been removed before thewar.   The phone-switching building, along with the buildingshousing the ministries of Defense and Industry and the BaathParty headquarters, all of which were described as destroyedby U.S. briefers, &quot;were empty when they were hit,&quot; said Mr.Arkin, who conducted his research as part of a team sponsoredby Harvard University.   Mr. Arkin, who said he has given his briefing severaltimes at the Pentagon and has had access to U.S. targetingplans, said that Iraqi officials estimated that only 506Iraqis died during the raids on Baghdad, which has apopulation of 4.4 million people. But the strikes knocked outmost of Iraq's electric power, and Mr. Arkin believes thatbetween 70,000 and 90,000 civilians may have died laterbecause of the cascading effect of electrical shortages onhospitals and water and sewage-treatment facilities.   An Air Force spokeswoman in Washington said officialshadn't yet received the report and wouldn't have any commentuntil they reviewed it. Spokesmen for the U.S. CentralCommand in Tampa, Fla., which developed the initial plans forthe air war, also declined to comment.   Mr. Arkin also said the U.S. gave false information on thedestruction of a mosque in Basra, claiming that Iraq hadpurposely dismantled the mosque to fabricate bomb damage.   &quot;The evidence is unambiguous that this building wasbombed,&quot; said Mr. Arkin. He said his research shows that aconcussion from a nearby U.S. bombing raid on an Iraqi navalfacility collapsed the dome of the mosque. A week later, headded, &quot;an errant laser-guided bomb&quot; aimed at a nearbytelecommunications facility collapsed part of the mosque'swalls.   While U.S. briefers denied they aimed at civilian foodsupplies, Mr. Arkin said he had examined the ruins of sevengovernment warehouses in southern Iraq that had beendestroyed in the bombing. &quot;They were full of the debris offoodstuffs, baby clothes and liquor&quot; that were being storedfor use in a civilian rationing program, Mr. Arkin asserted.   Mr. Arkin said that Air Force generals changed targetingplans from day to day -- driven by political sensitivities,&quot;whatever they saw in the media,&quot; and by pilots' yearning for&quot;single-point targets,&quot; such as bridges, which could bedestroyed in a single strike.   The distorted image given to Americans was not only theresult of Pentagon briefers, according to Mr. Arkin. He saidthe U.S. press did an &quot;abysmal job&quot; of covering the war.Checking press reports of the destruction of the ministriesof Trade and Oil, he found them undamaged. He found that abuilding described in the press as a historically importantdowntown palace had been destroyed, but he discovered ithoused offices of the Iraqi ministry of defense. A report ofa B-52 raid on Basra, he said, was unfounded.   The highly selective nature of the U.S. raids overBaghdad, Mr. Arkin asserted, may have encouraged Iraqiofficials to think that &quot;if they just hold tight, theAmericans will go away.&quot; He said Iraqis have been able torestore many facilities quickly because of their pre-warstorage of computers and electronic gear. For instance, hesaid the switching center had a lot of external damage whenhe visited it in August but was filled with workingequipment.   Mr. Arkin said one official he interviewed, Iraq'sminister of industry, told him that Iraq was prepared formuch more devastation, and that Iraqis were puzzled by theU.S. Air Force's selectivity. &quot;Carpet bombing,&quot; the ministertold Mr. Arkin. &quot;We would have understood that.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
