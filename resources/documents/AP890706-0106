(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state's highest court today struck down aNew York City law designed to help the homeless by forcing owners ofone-room apartments to rent them out.   The Court of Appeals ruled 5-2 ruled that the five-yearmoratorium on redevelopment of single-room occupancy hotels was anunlawful taking of private property.   ``No one minimizes the tragic reality of homelessness,'' saidJudge Stewart Hancock Jr. ``But the city's response _ to foist itsresponsibility on certain private property owners, by requiring themto remain in the SRO business or ransom their property rights _simply does not meet the requirements of the city and stateconstitutions.''   In a dissent, Judge Joseph Bellacosa complained about propertyrights being held more important than social policy. He recalledthat past courts struck down child labor laws because they hurtbusiness.   The 1985 New York City law prevents owners from demolishing SROhotels unless they pay $45,000 a room into a fund to try to savehousing for the poor, elderly and sick.   The city said its goal of trying to save 52,000 apartments andnot forcing residents out into the street justified such measures.   But the appeals court, overturning a lower-court ruling, said thelaw requires property owners ``to surrender the most basicattributes of private property, the rights of possession andexclusion.   The court noted that the city spent much of the 1970s trying toget SRO owners to tear down housing it considered a blight. About40,000 rooms were demolished to make way for office buildings andhousing for the rich.</TEXT></DOC>
