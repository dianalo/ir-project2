This combination allowsexperiments involving simultaneous ion irradiation/ion implantation,electron irradiation and electron microscopy/electron diffraction tobe performed. In addition the availability of a variety of microscopesample holders permits these as well as other types of in situ experimentsto be performed at temperatures ranging from 10-1300 K, with the samplein a stressed state or with simultaneous determination of electricalresistivity of the specimen. This paper summarizes the details of theFacility which are relevant to simultaneous ion beam material modificationand electron microscopy, presents several current applications and brieflydescribes the straightforward mechanism for potential users to accessthis US Department of Energy supported facility. 7 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
