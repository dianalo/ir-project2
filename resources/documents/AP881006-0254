(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Employees in the Du Pont Co.'s fibersbusiness soon will have a stake in the department's earnings, underan experimental program linking part of their pay raises to theirdepartment's financial performance.   The ``achievement sharing'' that takes effect Jan. 1 for about14,000 workers is expected to give employees incentive to see thatearnings continue to increase, Robert P. McNutt, who led the teamthat developed the plan, said Wednesday.   There will be at least a three-year trial for the plan and itthen could become a model for the entire company.   McNutt said the fibers department, which makes nylon among otherfibers, has had ``fairly flat performance.''   ``We need to continue to grow our earnings and it's key we keepour people involved and we're doing that by giving them a stake init. We're making them value the business,'' McNutt said.   The plan is unique because it does not freeze wages or ask foremployee ``give-backs,'' as do some similar plans in the autoindustry, according to McNutt.   Chemical industry analysts say the plan is trend-setting,although Du Pont is not the first company to try the concept.   Harvey S. Stober, a chemical analyst for Dean Witter in NewYork, said the plan was ``long overdue'' and could make employeesfeel they own part of the company.   ``The work could improve. Not to say it's suffered in the past.But to tie (pay) certainly peaks interest,'' Stober said. He alsosaid such plans can lead to employees becoming more efficient andfinding cost-saving ways to do their jobs.   ``Fibers is doing good, but it should be doing better and thisis a way to improve it,'' said William Young, a managing directorfor Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.   For the first six months of 1988, sales in fibers were $2.8billion, compared to $2.6 billion for the first six months of 1987.After tax operating income was $322 million for the first sixmonths of this year and for the same period in 1987.   Under the plan, Du Pont will begin placing an increasing portionof each workers annual pay raise ``at risk,'' until 6 percent ofeach employee's salary is at risk. That could take from three tofive years.   During the phase-in period, each employee will always receive atleast 1 percent of any raise, regardless of the fibers businessperformance.   Annual pay will be based on a target rate equalling what Du Pontwould pay employees not covered by the experimental plan, andraises and promotions would be based on the target rate. Thecompany will adjust actual pay each year based on the fibersbusiness financial results.   If the department achieves 150 percent of its profit goal,employees would get back the 6 percent of their pay that's at risk,plus a bonus of up to 12 percent of their salary, depending on theexcess earnings, McNutt said.   If the department achieves 80 percent of its profit goal, thepayout would be 3 percent of the money at risk. If the departmentearns less than 80 percent of its profit goal, there would be nopayout, meaning the employees would not get the 6 percent of theirraises that had been placed at risk.   The department has about 20,000 employees worldwide, most ofwhom will fall under the plan Jan. 1. The company must negotiatewith about 6,000 union workers at plants in Delaware, Tennessee andVirginia before those workers will partipate.   Donald M. Hitchens, president of the Seaford Nylon EmployeesCouncil, a union representing about 1,670 employees, said the unionprobably would vote on the plan by the end of the month.   But he said he did not know what impact the union's current wagedispute with the company would have on acceptance of the plan.Since March, the union twice has rejected the company's offer of a1.9 percent raise and a $400 lump sum payment.</TEXT></DOC>
