The Republican Democratic Party and the New DemocraticRepublican Party, the nation's second- and third-largest oppositionparties, have agreed in principle to form a new political party bymerging forces for mid-year local elections, the first suchelections in South Korea in three decades.   The combined party then could outshadow the current leadingopposition group, the Party for Peace and Democracy, andpotentially offer a forceful challenge to the governing party.   Kim Young-sam, leader of the Republican Democrats, today saidthe merger must be completed by March after ``prudently collectingopinions'' within and outside the party.   Kim Jong-pil, head of the smallest opposition party, told acaucus of his lawmakers that the ``goal is to shift to a betterpolitical system, which can operate better in the long run.''   Kim Jong-pil is related by marriage to former President ParkChung-hee and served as prime minister in the early 1970s. He alsowas the organizer and first director of the national securityagency, formerly called the KCIA.   Some lawmakers said they would boycott a move to join with KimJong-pil's party because they did not want to be associated withpast authoritarian regimes and instead would form an independentvoting bloc in Parliament.   South Korea has four political parties and most politiciansregard the system as unworkable. Repeated efforts among partyleaders to compromise have failed.   In the 1987 presidential elections, opposition votes were splitby two main opposition parties, helping governing party candidateRoh Tae-woo win by a narrow margin. The opposition leaders wereblamed by some for ignoring popular demand for a united oppositioncandidate.   Dissidents and radicals, claiming their views are notrepresented by the four major political parties, have announcedplans to organize a progressive political party supported byworkers, farmers and the poor.</TEXT></DOC>
