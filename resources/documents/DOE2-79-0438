Two of them have compositionswhich roughly represents the formation water in sand stone reservoirs.One is with added bicarbonate, the other is without. The third solutionis one representing a lime stone reservoir. A potensiostatic step techniquehas been used in the experiments. Before the steps are made, the electrodesare stabilized at certain potentials. During this stabilization, certainconditions are obtained on the surface. These can be studied by applyingpotensiostatic steps. It can be shown that both the anodic and the cathodicreactions are dependent on the potential at which the electrodes arestabilized. Also the electrolyte seems to play an important role. Itis expected that at anodic potentials a film of iron carbonate is formed.This film formation seems to be independent on the type of electrolyte.At cathodic potentials an other type of film seems to be formed. Theproperties of this film is highly dependent on the type of electrolyte.(With 19 refs.) (authors).</TEXT></DOC>
