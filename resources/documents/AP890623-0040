Four student leaders were caught in Zhangjiakou, a city about 110miles northwest of Beijing. One of them, Liu Fuan of Beijing MedicalUniversity, was said to have organized health care for students whomounted a one-week hunger strike last May on Beijing's TiananmenSquare.   Zhao Yiqiang, a teacher at the medical school, and his wife weredetained. Also arrested was Qin Weidong, a student at Beijing Ironand Steel Institute. He was accused of organizing crowds to set upbarricades to block the military advance into the city.   Troops smashed through the barricades on June 3, killing scoresof unarmed people as they shot their way toward students occupyingTiananmen Square.   The government has said variously that 200-300 people, most ofthem soldiers, died in the unrest. Western intelligence reports andChinese witnesses say the death toll may have been as high as 3,000.   A fifth person, a worker accused of beating soldiers and throwingstones during the military attack, was also arrested in Zhangjiakou,the Economic Daily reported.   Beijing radio said today that 27 people were given prison termsfor rioting in the southern city of Changsha last April in the earlydays of the protest movement. It said one of them, Li Weihong, wasgiven a death sentence with a two-year reprieve, meaning thesentence will be commuted to life imprisonment if he behaves wellfor two years.   Twenty-seven people were executed Wednesday and Thursday,including seven in Beijing for attacking soldiers and destroyingmilitary vehicles during the June 3-4 military push to TiananmenSquare. In carrying out the death sentences, China has ignoredinternational appeals for clemency and international sanctions,including a cutoff of U.S. military aid.   In Washington, the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursdayunanimously condemned the ``murderous crackdown and brutalrepression of the pro-democracy movement'' and supported PresidentBush's call for an end to the executions.   In China today, Beijing radio also reported the arrest of Li Bin,a worker accused of the murder and burning of Liu Guogeng, one ofthe soldiers the government has raised to martyr status in thestruggle to put down the ``counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' as theprotests are now called.   Liu's father, an army veteran who walks with a crutch, has beenshown frequently on state-controlled television being consoled bythe nation's top leadership.   Despite the large numbers of arrests, more than 1,600 since earlyJune, the official media insists that the rebellion was perpetratedby a ``small handful'' of agitators.   The ``small handful'' is not identified, although dissident FangLizhi, who is now under the protection of the U.S. Embassy, isincluded among those branded ``counterrevolutionary elements.''   An editorial in the People's Daily, the official voice of theCommunist Party, said today that ``class struggle,'' a concept thathad been in eclipse since the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, wasstill under way. ``We should not lower our vigilance,'' the papersaid.   During the Cultural Revolution, tens of thousands of people werejailed, persecuted and killed after they were accused of being classenemies.   Today's editorial said agitators were taking advantage of aninternational trend of trying to push socialist countries towardcapitalism.   ``We must fight against this trend. Otherwise, socialist Chinawill be turned into a vassal of international capitalism,'' thepaper said.   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, after rising to power a decade ago,played down class struggle and talked instead of economicmodernization. However, he appears to have revived the ideologicalline in a bid to smother dissent and hold onto power.</TEXT></DOC>
