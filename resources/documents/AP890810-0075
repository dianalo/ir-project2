Western diplomats and an opposition party spokesman said,however, the government also has arrested thousands of politicaldissidents.   Under an amnesty announced July 20, death sentences for criminaloffenses were commuted to life imprisonment, life terms werereduced to 10 years, and all others were cut by two thirds.   Cases under trial against people arrested before the militarytakeover Sept. 18 were to be dropped and those serving sentences ofunder two years were to be immediately released, the order said.   The amnesty does not apply to cases of treason or breaches ofmartial law, which was imposed during the takeover to prevent openpolitical dissent.   Rangoon-based Western diplomats contacted by telephone fromBangkok on Wednesday said the military had arrested up to 3,000people on political charges since July 20 after putting under housearrest Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, the leaders of the mainopposition party the National League for Democracy.   Diplomats and dissidents said that in the time between the armytakeover and the latest wave of arrests up to 3,000 more people mayhave been arrested.   Martial law forbids political gatherings of more than fivepeople. Military tribunals already have sentenced to death threemembers of the National League for allegedly planning a bombattack. Five youths were given five-year jail terms for shoutingslogans during an anti-government protest July 17.   During last year's mass protests for democracy, authorities alsoreleased thousands of criminals on to the streets. Diplomats saidthe move was aimed at convincing the people of the need for a tougharmy presence.   They also speculated that authorities may want to clear space inthe jails to make way for newly arrested political prisoners.</TEXT></DOC>
