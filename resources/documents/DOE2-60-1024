The signal from the vessels aretransmitted, by optic-fiber cables, to an automatic acquisition systemfor data recording and processing. The system allows continuous monitoringand &quot;real-time&quot; evaluation of settlements at selected points of plantstructures. This report describes the installation of this instrumentationsystem in the Caorso nuclear power station and some significant measurementsobtained by the system during its first operational period. Design activitiesare in progress for a next installation of the system in Montalto diCastro nuclear power station currently in the course of construction.</TEXT></DOC>
