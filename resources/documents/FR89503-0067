Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from April 8, 1989 through April 21, 1989. The last biweeklynotice was published on April 19, 1989 (54 FR 15820). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By June 2, 1989 the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Arkansas Power andamp; Light Company, Docket Nos. 50-313 and 50-368,Arkansas Nuclear One, Units 1 and 2, Pope County, Arkansas </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>December 12, 1986 and April 14, 1988as amended. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The licensee requested severaladministrative changes to the Technical Specifications (TS) for each unit.One change was to establish a range of membership of the Safety ReviewCommittee (SRC) from eight to twelve members, instead of strictly eightas currently specified in the TS for each unit. Also, this change wouldprovide an equivalent SRC meeting quorum requirement. Other TS changesrequested in the licensee's submittal have been noticed separately. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofthe standards in 10 CFR 50.92 by providing certain examples (51 FR 7744).One of the examples (i) of these actions involving no significant hazardsconsideration relates to a purely administrative change to Technical Specifications.The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications for Arkansas NuclearOne, Units 1 and 2, would allow the voting members on the safety reviewcommittee (SRC) to vary from a minimum of eight to a maximum of 12 personsplus the SRC chairman. This change would provide some flexibility thatwould enhance the functioning of the SRC and does not reduce the existingrequirements regarding member qualifications and SRC duties and responsibilities,and provides an equivalent definition of what constitutes a quorum. Theseproposed changes are administrative in nature and do not change the functionalrequirements of the SRC presently in the Technical Specifications and,therefore, involve no significant hazards. These requests do not involvea significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accidentor other adverse condition over previous evaluations; or create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident or condition over previous evaluations;or involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Based on thisinformation, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed change doesnot present a significant hazard. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Tomlinson Library, ArkansasTech University, Russellville, Arkansas 72801 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Nicholas S. Reynolds, Esq., Bishop, Cook,Purcell, andamp; Reynolds, 1400 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005-3502<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Jose A. Calvo <ITAG tagnum="84">Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-454 and 50-455, ByronNuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Ogle County, Illinois; and DocketNos. 50-456 and 50-457 Braidwood Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Will County,Illinois </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendments: </T3>January 25, 1989, supplementedFebruary 3, 1989. <T3>Description of amendments request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldrevise Techncial Specification 5.3.1 of Appendix A of those licenses toreplace the values of the maximum enrichment of reload fuel with a referenceto a report entitled ``Criticality Analysis of Byron and Braidwood StationFuel Storage Racks,'' which contains the values of those limits. In addition,reference to this report has been included in the Definitions Section ofthe Technical Specifications (TS) to note that it is the unit-specificdocument that provides these limits for the current operating reload cycle.Furthermore, the definition notes that the values of these cycle-specificparameter limits are to be determined in accordance with the Specification6.9.1.10. This specification requires that these limits be determined foreach reload cycle in accordance with the referenced NRC-approved methodologyfor these limits, and be consistent with the applicable limits of the safetyanalysis. Finally, this report and any mid-cycle revisions shall be provided to theNRC upon issuance. Generic Letter 88-16, dated October 4, 1988, from theNRC provided guidance to the licensees on requests for removal of the valuesof cycle-specific parameters from TS. The licensee's proposed amendmentis in response to this Generic Letter. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The staff has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined thatit involves no significant hazards consideration. According to 10 CFR 50.92(c),a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence ofan accident previously evaluated; or 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated; or 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed revision to the License Condition is in accordance with theguidance provided in Generic Letter 88-16 for licensees requesting removalof the values of cycle-specific parameters from TS. The establishment ofthese limits in accordance to an NRC-approved methodology and the incorporationof these limits into ``Criticality Analysis of Byron and Braidwood StationFuel Storage Racks'' will ensure that proper steps have been taken to establishthe values of these limits. Furthermore, the submittal of this report willallow the staff to continue to trend the values of these limits withoutthe need for prior staff approval of these limits and without introductionon an unreviewed safety question. The revised specifications with the removalof the values of cycle-specific parameter limits and with addition of thereferenced report for these limits does not create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. Theyalso don't involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety sincethe change does not alter the methods used to establish these limits. Consequently, the proposed change on the removal of the values of cycle-specificlimits does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. Because the values of cycle-specific parameters will continue to be determinedin accordance with an NRC-approved methodology and be consistent with theapplicable limits of the safety analysis, these changes are administrativein nature and do not impact the operation of the facility in a manner thatinvolves significant hazards considerations. The proposed amendment does not alter either the requirement that the plantbe operated within the limits for cycle-specific parameters or the requiredremedial actions that must be taken when these limits are not met. Whileit is recognized that such requirements are essential to plant safety,the values of limits can be determined in accordance with NRC-approvedmethods without affecting nuclear safety. With the removal of the valuesof these limits from the technical specifications, they have been incorporatedinto a report that is submitted to the Commission. Hence, appropriate measuresexist to control the values of these limits. These changes are administrativein nature and do not impact the operation of the facility in a manner thatinvolves significant hazards considerations. Based on the preceding assessment, the staff believes this proposed amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>For Byron Station, the RockfordPublic Library, 215 N.

Muller <ITAG tagnum="84">Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-254 and 50-265, Quad CitiesNuclear Power Station, Units 1 and 2, Rock Island County, Illinois </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendments: </T3>April 11, 1989 <T3>Description of amendments request: </T3>Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.90, CommonwealthEdison Company (CECo, the licensee) proposed to amend Appendix A, TechnicalSpecifications (TS), of Facility Operating Licenses DPR-29 and DPR-30 forthe Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station (QCNPS). The proposed amendment willchange the current language of TS surveillance requirement 4.7.A.2.b tobe consistent with the test frequency delineated in 10 CFR Part 50, AppendixJ (``Primary Reactor Containment Leakage Testing for Water Cooled PowerReactors''). The existing TS requirement is more restrictive than 10 CFRPart 50, Appendix J and could require a plant shutdown prior to a scheduledrefueling outage, especially in light of 18-month fuel cycles. The provisionsof 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J are structured such that this situation wouldbe prevented. TS 4.7.A.2.b requires a Type A test be performed at leastevery 18 months in the event that two consecutive Type A tests fail tomeet applicable acceptance criteria. The proposed change would requirea Type A test be performed at each shutdown for refueling or approximatelyevery 18 months, whichever occurs first, in the event that two consecutivetests failed. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from an accident previously evaluated; or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In accordancewith 10 CFR 50.92, CECo conducted an analysis of their proposed amendmentand concluded that it does not involve a significant hazards consideration.In a Federal Register notice publication dated March 6, 1986 (51 FR 7751)the Commission provided guidance on ``Examples of Amendments That Are ConsideredNot Likely To Involve Significant Hazards Consideration.'' Example (vii)is defined as ``A change to conform a license to changes in the regulations,where the license change results in very minor changes to facility operationsclearly in keeping with the regulations.'' Appendix J of 10 CFR Part 50was made a regulatory rule after Quad Cities Station was licensed. CECopreviously submitted a TS amendment request, dated April 13, 1981, to incorporatethe provisions of Appendix J. The NRC approved this request as licenseamendments (No. 82 and 76 for Units 1 and 2, respectively) on November2, 1982. Unfortunately this original TS amendment language for conductingType A tests, following consecutive failures, was not an accurate reflectionof the actual regulatory requirements. Consequently, CECo's subsequentrequest, dated April 11, 1989 to amend their facility license, is attemptingto correct this discrepancy and make TS 4.7.A.2.b conform exactly withAppendix J as it should have been originally. The current difference betweenTS 4.7.A.2.b and Appendix J does not result from any technical design orlicensing basis. The TS wording proposed for QCNPS is also consistent withcurrent Dresden TS, a similar nuclear power station in vintage and design.NRC staff reviewed the licensee's application and analysis of no significanthazards consideration. Based upon this review and the above discussion,and Commission guidance the NRC staff proposes to determine that this amendmentrequest does not involve significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Dixon Public Library, 221Hennepin Avenue, Dixon, Illinois 61021. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Michael I.

The proposed amendment will:(a) split and revise existing Technical Specification (TS) section 3.3.1.5``Isolated Loop,'' into sections 3.3.1.5 ``Isolated Loop'' (Modes 1 and2) and 3.3.1.6 ``Isolated Loop'' (Modes 3, 4, 5 and 6), (b) renumber andrevise existing TS section 3.3.1.6 ``Isolated Loop Startup,'' to TS section3.3.1.7 ``Idled Loop,'' (Modes 3, 4, 5 and 6), and (c) split and reviseexisting TS section 3.3.1.8 ``Idled Loop Startup,'' into sections 3.3.1.10``Idled Loop Startup'' (Modes 1 and 2) and 3.3.1.11 ``Idled Loop Startup''(Modes 3, 4, 5 and 6). Currently, the TS requires that the boron concentrationin the idled/isolated loops be maintained greater than or equal to theboron concentration in the operating loops. In Modes 1 and 2, the proposedamendment will not alter the current TS. In Modes 3, 4, 5 and 6, the TSwill be revised to require a boron concentration in the idled/isolatedloops that is greater than or equal to the shutdown margin requirementsas specified in the current TS Sections 3.1.10.2, 3.10.1.3 and 3.13. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazard exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. CYAPCO has reviewed the proposedchanges and concluded that the proposed amendment satisfies the three criteriain 10 CFR 50.92 and therefore involves no significant hazards consideration.CYAPCO has provided the following discussion regarding these three criteria.The proposed changes do not: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Boron Concentration Change in Proposed Technical Specification Sections3.3.1.6 through 3.3.1.11 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The safety analysis assumes that the inactive loop is at the boronconcentration which corresponds to the shutdown margin requirement. Inaccuraciesin determining the concentration are accounted for in the analysis. Theproposed change requires that an idled or isolated loop be at a boron concentrationgreater than or equal to that required to meet the shutdown margin. Thus,the change does not impact the consequences of the idled or isolated analysis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other Changes in Proposed Technical Specification Sections 3.3.1.6and 3.3.1.9 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to the boron concentration change addressed in the abovediscussion, the applicability requirements have been increased to includeMODE 6. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The increased requirements will reduce the potential for reactivitytransients during operation in MODE 6. The safety analysis assumes thatthe boron concentration and temperature surveillances are performed whena loop is isolated or idled during operation in MODE 6. Thus, the changeis consistent with the safety analysis and does not impact the consequencesof any event. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other Changes in Proposed Technical Specification Section 3.3.1.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to the boron concentration change addressed in the abovediscussion, the applicability requirements have been increased to includeMODE 6, the LCO requirement to keep the reactor subcritical by 1000 pcmhas been deleted, and a footnote has been added which removes from theapplicability section the instances when a hot leg loop isolation valveis opened to create an idled loop configuration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The inclusion of MODE 6 is acceptable as discussed above for TechnicalSpecification Section 3.3.1.6. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The definition of MODES 3, 4, and 5 require that the reactor be subcriticalwith K<T2>eff</T2> less than .99 and MODE 6 requires K<T2>eff</T2> less than .94. Thus the requirement on subcriticality in thissection is redundant and can be deleted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The note which removes from the applicability section the instanceswhen a hot leg loop isolation valve is opened to create an idled loop,does not impact the design basis events. With the cold leg loop isolationvalve closed there will be no flow through the loop. Thus there will beno flow induced reactivity insertion to the RCS due to temperature or boronconcentration differences. If the RCS were depressurized after openingthe loop isolation valve, less than 10 ft.3 of fluid would be displacedinto the remainder of the RCS. This volume of fluid is insignificant whencompared to the volume of fluid in the remainder of the RCS. In addition,any cooldown of the RCS that would most probably occur as the plant isdepressurized would negate this effect of the depressurization. For thesereasons the proposed change has an insignificant impact on the design basisevents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other Changes in Proposed Specification Section 3.3.1.11 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to the boron concentration change addressed in the abovediscussion, the discussion of Specification 3.3.1.7 regarding removal ofthe requirement to remain 1000 pcm subcritical applies here. For thesereasons the change does not impact the consequences of the design basisevents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.The proposed change only modifies the required boron concentration foridled and isolated loops during operation in MODES 3 through 6. The proposedchanges are consistent with the safety analysis for idled loop startupand do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Involve a significant reduction in margin of safety. The currentTechnical Specification bases provide margin against a dilution event inMODES 3, 4, and 6 by requiring an idled or isolated loop to be at the sameconcentration as the remainder of the RCS. The safety analysis assumesthat the idled or isolated loop(s) is at a boron concentration greaterthan or equal to that required to meet shutdown or refueling requirements,whichever is appropriate. The proposed changes are consistent with thesafety analysis and, therefore, do not reduce the margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the analysis provided by the licensee in supportof a no significant hazards consideration determination. The staff agreeswith the licensee's analysis and believes that the licensee has met thecriteria for such a determination. Therefore, the staff proposes to determinethat the proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Russell Library, 123 BroadStreet, Middletown, Connecticut 06457. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry andamp;Howard, Counselors at Law, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3499.<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John F.

A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of thecriteria for determining whether a significant hazards consideration existsby providing certain examples of actions involving no significant hazardsconsiderations and examples of actions involving significant hazards considerations(51 FR 7750). One of the examples of actions involving no significant hazardsconsiderations is example (ii) ``a change that constitutes an additionalrestriction, . . . , e.g., a more stringent surveillance requirement.''Because the application for amendment involves a change encompassed byan example for which no significant hazards consideration exists, the staffhas made a proposed determination that the application involves no significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Reference and Documents Department,Penfield Library, State University of New York, Oswego, New York 13126.<T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mark Wetterhahn, Esq., Conner andamp; Wetterhahn,Suite 1050, 1747 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20006. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Robert A.

The ATWSRule requires that the SLCS for BWRs have an equivalent control capacityof 86 gpm of 13 weight percent sodium pentaborate solution. One of theproposed changes to the surveillance requirements (SR) on the SLCS wouldbe inclusion of a formula that includes the concentration of sodium pentaborateand the two pump flowrate to comply with the ATWS Rule. The SRs would alsobe revised to specify that the available volume of sodium pentaborate solutionmust be at least 4537 gallons, instead of having the operators determinethe minimum required volume from a figure, and to require that the availableweight of sodium pentaborate must be at least 5389 pounds.

The only remaining Radiological ETS inAppendix B is Section 3.1.1.6, Meteorological Monitoring. Section 3.3.3.4of Appendix A to the Unit 1 license is a duplicate of Section 3.1.1.6 ofAppendix B. The fact that only Unit 1 Technical Specifications has theMeteorological Monitoring requirements is not of any safety significance.There is only one meteorological monitoring tower for both the Salem Units.The Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) requires the instruments tobe operable at all times. However, if the LCO is not met, the Action Statementsdo not prohibit mode changes nor require a plant shutdown. Implementation of the EPP will terminate the terrestrial monitoring requirements.A summary assessment report titled, ``An Environmental Monitoring Program1974-1984 on Diamondback Terrapin Nesting and Osprey Nesting/Bald EagleOccurrence in the Vicinity of Artificial Island,'' concluded that Salemhas had no adverse environmental impact on either the diamondback terrapinor the osprey/bald eagle. The monitoring program has continued to be conductedand the data collected in subsequent years support the conclusion. Thisprogram was required to be continued for five years after Unit 2 becameoperational. Unit 2 became operational in 1981.

The proposed amendment would modify paragraph 2.C.(3)of Facility Operating License No. DPR-54 to require compliance with therevised plan. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>On August 4, 1986 (51 FR 27817 and 27822), the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission amended Part 73 of its regulations, ``Physical Protection ofPlants and Materials,'' to clarify plant security requirements to affordan increased assurance of plant safety. The amended regulations requiredthat each nuclear power reactor licensee submit proposed amendments toits security plan to implement the revised provisions of 10 CFR 73.55.The licensee submitted its revised plan on November 24, 1986, September21, 1987, and December 14, 1987, to satisfy the requirements of the amendedregulations. The Commission proposes to amend the license to referencethe revised plan. In the Supplementary Materials accompanying the amended regulations, theCommission indicated that it was amending its regulations ``to providea more safety conscious safeguards system while maintaining the currentlevels of protection'' and that the ``Commission believes that the clarificationand refinement of requirements as reflected in these amendments is appropriatebecause they afford an increased assurance of plant safety.'' The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of thecriteria for determining whether a significant hazards consideration existsby providing certain examples of actions involving no significant hazardsconsiderations and examples of actions involving significant hazards considerations(51 FR 7750). One of these examples of actions involving no significantconsiderations is example (vii) ``a change to conform a license to changesin the regulations, where the license change results in very minor changesto facility operations clearly in keeping with the regulations.'' The changesin this case fall within the scope of the example.

Also, the Technical Specifications wouldbe changed to appropriately define the purge system operation requirementsand add reference to reactor building equalization isolation in TechnicalSpecification Table 3.5.1-1, ``Process Instrumentation,'' Item 9. The proposed amendment would remove the ``at cold shutdown or refueling''operator action statement in Table 3.5.1-1, ``Process Instrumentation,''Item 9, column (c); modify the action statement to ensure the equalizationvalves and the purge valves are properly addressed in relation to high-rangereactor building area radiation monitor operability and provide consistencyand proper cross-referencing within the Technical Specifications; and changethe Minimum Channels Operable requirement in column (B) of Table 3.5.1-1for the high-range reactor building area radiation monitors from 1 to 2.The proposed amendment would also add reference to reactor building pressureequalization valves to Technical Specification 3.6.8, modify TechnicalSpecification Section 3.8, ``Fuel Loading and Refueling,'' to provide appropriaterefueling restriction on the operability of the reactor building purgesystem and the reactor building stack radiation monitor, and add a newrefueling Technical Specification. Additionally, the proposed amendment would shorten the Technical Specificationrequired surveillance interval for the reactor building equalization valvesfrom 6 months to 3 months. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated: (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff finds that the proposed amendment does not (1) Involve asignificant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated because the licensee states that containment integritywould be maintained at all times when it is required by the Technical Specifications.Moreover, the proposed changes are within the bounds of the accident analysisof reactor building pressure equalization during power operation containedin the Safety Analysis Report; (2) The proposed amendment does not createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluatedbecause, currently, the purge valves are required to be closed during coldshutdown when the high-range reactor building area radiation monitors areinoperable and containment integrity is not required, thus allowing forthe possibility of an unmonitored, unfiltered release through the equipmentor personnel hatches. The licensee stated that deleting this requirementwill remove the possibility of an unmonitored, unfiltered release of radiationunder the above described conditions. Additionally, the licensee statedthat there are no hardware modifications and providing limitations on thereactor building pressure equalization operations will assure that theSafety Analysis Report accident analysis that considers equalization duringpower operation will remain bounding for pressure equalization operations;(3) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety because the licensee plans to maintain containment integrityat all appropriate times, such as during power operation, when the reactoris above cold shutdown, and during refueling. The licensee states thatthe changes proposed would not compromise any of the bases for the affectedTechnical Specifications. Therefore, based on the above, the staff proposes to determine that theproposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Martin Luther King RegionalLibrary, 7340 24th Street Bypass, Sacramento, California 95822. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>David S.

The licensee has determined that the proposed change will not: (1) Involvea significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated because the fire hazards analysis demonstrates thatthe construction features, low combustible loadings and equipment layoutwithin the NSEB serve to contain the postulated fire within the given firearea and limit potential fire damage to one train of systems importantto safety without reliance on automatic fire suppression; (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated because the NSEB Train A and Train B equipment credited for post-firesafe shutdown is protected in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFRPart 50, Appendix R; (3) Involve a significant reduction in the marginof safety because the existing fire detection system will remain operational.Adequate fire suppression capability is available to confine and extinguishfires occurring where safety-related equipment or redundant systems requiredfor safe shutdown are located.

Sources.'' This revision proposed to modify the value for the averageelectrolyte temperature referenced in TS 4.8.2.1.b.3 and the value forthe battery capacity as referenced in TS 4.8.2.1.e. The submittal proposedmodifying the average electrolyte temperature in TS 4.8.2.1.b.3 from 60anddegrees;F to 65anddegrees; F and battery capacity in TS 4.8.2.1.e from 80% to 90%.The licensee identified during an emergency power review, that the calculationfor sizing ESF Batteries 1A andamp; 1B used derating factors for aging andtemperature more conservative than those identified in the TS. The calculationsused an aging derating factor of 90% and a temperature derating factorof 94% (65anddegrees; F) as opposed to 80% aging derating factor and 90%(60anddegrees; F) temperature derating factor, as presently stated in theTS. In respect to the ``Aging Factor,'' it has been identified that 90%for the capacity of the battery at the end of its useful life was usedin the original calculation, dated December 26, 1980, based on a letterfrom the manufacturer. In respect to the ``Temperature Derating Factor,''a factor of 94% for battery capacity has been used to account for the effectof minimum temperature. As identified in the Final Safety Analysis Report(FSAR) Table 3.11-3, the minimum design temperature for the battery roomis 65anddegrees; F. During normal plant operation, the battery room temperatureis controlled by a thermostat, which is set to maintain the room temperatureat 75anddegrees; F. If the control system malfunctions, a bistable controllerconnected to a temperature element in the room will close the supply damperif the temperature falls below 70anddegrees; F (the dampers will reopen ifthe temperature increases). The standard temperature for stating cell capacity is 77anddegrees; F. Temperaturecorrection factors are used to determine the additional battery capacityrequired at lower temperatures to achieve the same battery performance,as if it were 77anddegrees; F. Electrolyte temperature is assured to be ata temperature equal to or greater than ambient because of the heating effectsof the float charge. Thus, the minimum room design temperature of 65anddegrees;F has been used in conjunction with vendor supplied curves, for the specificbattery in use, to establish the derating factor of 94%. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee has determined with respect to the August 24, 1988 submittalthat: 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated becausethe revised derating factors will provide added assurance that the batterieswill maintain capacity to perform their design function. 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident than previously evaluated because the proposed changesdo not change any hardware. They provide more conservative derating factorsto use in establishing the condition of the batteries. As such, the revisiondoes not create a new or different kind of accident. 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in amargin of safety. Since the revised derating factors are more conservative,the margin in capacity of the batteries is increased, not decreased. The staff has reviewed these determinations and is in agreement with them.Accordingly, the Commission proposed to determine that these changes donot involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Fairfield County Library,Garden and Washington Streets, Winnsboro, South Carolina 29180 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Randolph R.

Table 4.3-1, ``Reactor Trip System InstrumentationSurveillance Requirements,'' of the TS was proposed to be revised to modifyTable Notation 11 and to add Table Notations 12-14. This Table was alsoproposed to be modified to have Table Notations 11 and 12 apply to theTrip Actuating Device Operational Test for the Manual Reactor Trip functionalunit and the Reactor Trip Breaker functional unit, respectively. In addition,the Reactor Trip Bypass Breaker was added as a functional unit to Table4.3-1 with Table Notations 13 and 14 applying to this unit. On May 25, 1985, the Commission issued Generic Letter 85-09, ``TechnicalSpecifications for Generic Letter 83-28, Item 4.3.'' Generic Letter 83-28,Item 4.3 established the requirement for automatic actuation of the shunttrip attachment for Westinghouse plants. Later the staff concluded thatTechnical Specification changes should be proposed to explicitly requireindependent testing of the undervoltage and shunt trip attachments duringpower operation and independent testing of the control room manual switchcontacts during each refueling outage.

However, a closed feedwater isolation valvein Modes 2 or 3 is in its required position for plant safety. An inoperablestatus for a feedwater isolation valve is only a concern if the affectedvalve is open and cannot be closed. For this case, a planned shutdown mustbe executed. This requirement is reflected in the current Technical Specificationand remains valid. The number of closed but inoperable feedwater isolation valves would nothave an impact on plant safety. Thus, the Technical Specification requirementregarding an inoperable feedwater isolation valve in Mode 2 or 3 beingmaintained in the closed position supports the licensing-basis safety analysisassumptions of closed feedwater isolation valves upon receipt of a signalto do so.

Surveillance Requirement 4.7.8.1.1.e.2 specifies an 18 month surveillancefrequency to demonstrate operability of the fire suppression water systemby performing a system functional test. This includes cycling each valvein the flow path that is not testable during plant operation through atleast one complete cycle of full travel.

The preplanned alternate monitoring methodfor containment high range area radiation is to utilize one of the twobackup monitors located inside each containment.

Presently the technical specification requireschannel checks and channel functional tests on a 12-hour and monthly frequencyrespectively. The licensee proposes to amend the Technical Specificationsto (1) eliminate the 12-hour channel check requirement and (2) change thechannel functional test frequency from monthly to semi-annually. <T3>Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The reduction in surveillance is based on enhanced operating capabilitiesof the leak detection system due to replacement of the present equipment(based on Riley Model 86 temperature switches) with General Electric NuclearMeasurement Analysis and Control (NUMAC) micro-computer based instrumentation.During the upcoming spring refueling outage the licensee intends to replacethe Riley temperature switches in the leak detection system with GeneralElectric Nuclear Measurement and Control instrumentation. The NUMAC equipmentwill receive signals from the presently installed thermocouples and providealarm and trip signals to existing circuitry. All functions of the leakdetection system will remain, the replacement is being done to enhanceoverall system reliability. The licensee contends that the enhanced capabilities of the NUMAC instrumentationjustify the reduction in surveillance and thus the proposed amendment tothe Technical Specifications. The NUMAC equipment has significantly bettertotal channel drift characteristics and the design incorporates diagnosticand self-test features. These design features provide a more comprehensiveassessment of system operability every 30 minutes than that presently providedby the Riley instrument channel check on a 12-hour basis. The Supply System has evaluated this amendment request per 10 CFR 50.59and 50.92 and determined that it does not represent an unreviewed safetyquestion or a significant hazard because it does not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated because the NUMAC design providing betterchannel drift characteristics and incorporating diagnostic and self-testfeatures should ensure a level of operability and functionality of theleak detection system comparable to that achieved with the present equipmentand testing schedule. Hence, the probability or consequences of previouslyevaluated accidents are not increased by this change. (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated because the function of the leak detectionsystem would not change. The licensee believes that a new or differentkind of accident due to functional testing on a semi-annual versus monthlyfrequency or due to substitution of the self-test for the manual checkis not credible. (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the diagnosticand self-test functions in lieu of a manual channel check, and semi-annualfunctional testing would ensure the NUMAC equipment functions as intended.Due to the diagnostic, self-test, and channel drift features, system operabilitywould be assessed more frequently and accurately, failure would be identifiedmore readily, operator efficiency would be increased and presently recognizedmargins would be conservatively preserved. Hence, the licensee believesthe margin of safety would be increased through the use of the NUMAC equipment.Based on the above considerations the Commission proposes to determinethat the requested changes to the WNP-2 Technical Specifications involveno significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Richland City Library, Swiftand Northgate Streets, Richland, Washington 99352. <T3>Attorneys for licensees: </T3>Nicholas S.

Technical Specification 3/4.2.7, Neutron Flux Noise Monitoring, would beeliminated. This specification places limits on APRM and LPRM neutron fluxnoise levels. Two new specifications would be added to require stability monitoring fortwo loop and single loop operation. The new specifications would add limitingconditions of operation for the decay ratio of the neutron signals. Thestability monitoring is based on the LPRMs and the APRMs and thus effectivelyaddresses the objective of the neutron flux noise monitoring specification(3/4.2.7) proposed for deletion. Technical Specification 3/4.4.1, Recirculation System would be revisedto specify actions to be taken to ensure stability with less than two recirculationpumps operating. Corresponding sections of the Bases of the Technical Specifications wouldbe revised to reflect the new bases for the revised specifications. <T3>Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. On December 30, 1988 NRC issued IE Bulletin 88-07, Supplement 1, ``PowerOscillations in Boiling Water Reactors.'' This supplement required licenseesto take certain actions to protect against power instabilities in the reactorcore. In response to Supplement 1 the Washington Public Power Supply Systemproposed replacing the existing detect-and-suppress technical specificationswith specifications based on the Advanced Nuclear Fuels (ANF) ANNA StabilityMonitoring System. The current specifications require evaluation of neutronsignal noise against a baseline noise level. The licensee contends thatthe ANNA system provides a much stronger, faster means of monitoring thestability of the reactor core. The ANNA system performs a sophisticated noise analysis technique to calculatethe decay ratio of neutron signals (LPRM and APRM). These calculationsare performed automatically, such that peak-to-peak and decay ratio datais presented in near real-time. As a result, the ANNA system provides informationmore rapidly than existing methods, and without the distractions to controlroom staff imposed by current methods. In addition, the decay ratio informationavailable through the ANNA system is a primary indicator of the state ofthe core stability, whereas the current indicator, neutron signal noiselevel, is an indirect, less reliable means. The licensee believes thatthrough use of the ANNA system, a much more quantitative measure of themargin of instability exists. This significant improvement in detectingthe approach to a region of instability is the licensee's justificationfor the proposed enlargement of the allowable region of operation. The Supply System has reviewed this amendment request per 10 CFR 50.92and has determined that it does not represent an unreviewed safety questionor a significant hazard because it does not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated because, as discussed above, the ANNAsystem represents a substantial improvement in the capability to detect-and-suppress,such that the present safety margin is preserved for operation in an expandedregion. The use of the ANNA system provides greatly improved ability todetect the approach to a region of instability. It is the Supply System'sjudgement that this improved detection capability more than compensatesfor the enlargement of the power/flow operating region such that the presentsafety margin is preserved and in fact increased. Hence, the probabilityor consequences of previously evaluated accidents are not increased bythis change. (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated because the design basis function, todetect-and-suppress core instability events, remains the same and is enhancedby the ANNA system. (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because as discussedabove, the implementation of ANNA would provide improved detection capabilitywhich would more than compensate for the enlargement of the allowable rangeof operation. Hence, there is no reduction in the margin of safety dueto this proposal. Based on the above considerations the Commission proposes to determinethat the requested changes to the WNP-2 Technical Specifications involveno significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Richland City Library, Swiftand Northgate Streets, Richland, Washington 99352. <T3>Attorneys for licensees: </T3>Nicholas S.

The licensee has provided an analysis of no significant hazards considerationin its request for a license amendment. The licensee proposes to: (A) Revise Technical Specification item 15.3.8.7 to reflect more specificrequirements regarding the Containment Purge and Vent System as found inthe Standard Technical Specifications for the Westinghouse PressurizedWater Reactors, NUREG-0452, revision 4. The modified specification willrequire demonstration of the operability of the Containment Purge and VentSystem ``within four days prior to the start of and at least once per sevendays during refueling operations.'' (B) Add a new Technical Specification item 15.3.8.8 which will introducean exception to the operability requirement of Technical Specificationitem 15.3.8.7. It allows refueling operations to continue with the ContainmentPurge and Vent System inoperable, provided the purge and vent containmentpenetrations are closed. (C) Modify the wording of the existing Technical Specification item 15.3.8.8,which becomes a new Technical Specification item 15.3.8.9. This item willidentify more concisely the conditions under which refueling operationswill cease. This is necessary due to the revision of Technical Specificationitems 15.3.8.7 and 15.3.8.8.

The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of thecriteria by providing examples (51 FR 7751) of actions that are considerednot likely to involve a significant hazards consideration. This guidancehas been applied to the aforementioned items and is outlined below. In regards to items (A), (B), and (C) above, these items are indicativeof example (ii) ``A change that constitutes an additional limitation, restriction,or control not presently included in the Technical Specification...'' Theproposed change constitutes a more restrictive operability requirementfor an isolation system during refueling operations. Additionally, theproposed amendment cannot affect the probability or consequences of a refuelingaccident nor create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.Moreover, this proposal increases, rather than decreases, the margin ofsafety.
