(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With the fall of television evangelistsJimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker, many disillusioned believers areattempting to turn their backs on their fundamentalist faiths, saysthe founder of Fundamentalists Anonymous.   ``People leaving the Moonies actually get more support becausepeople say, `Oh my God, you used to be one of them,''' said JimLuce, referring to followers of the Korean cult leader Sun MyungMoon.   About 50,000 people have contacted the support group for helpsince Luce and Richard Yao, a fellow Wall Street executive, ran atwo-line ad in New York's Village Voice newspaper three years agosuggesting a self-help group for former fundamentalists, Luce said.   ``The concept that fundamentalism can go so far overboard thatpeople can be hurt is being readily accepted,'' said Luce in atelephone interview from his office in New York.   ``We define fundamentalism as a mind-set that sees the world inblack and white, right and wrong, good and evil. A mind-set that isvery authoritarian, intolerant and compulsive about imposing itsbeliefs on others,'' he said.   Those seeking help from the group have included Catholics,Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons and even ``a couple of JapaneseBuddhist fundamentalists,'' Luce said.   ``We're not saying that all fundamentalists have this problem.But if you take your religious beliefs to the extreme to the pointwhere you become dysfunctional, then obviously you have aproblem,'' he said.   People trying to leave a fundamentalist faith often feel cut offfrom life, since they typically have been attending several churchfunctions a week and spending most of their weekends in religiousactivities, Luce said. Those who leave often are shunned by friendsand family, he said.   ``These people have no social skills outside offundamentalism,'' he said. ``Fundamentalism has its own rules, itsown social system. So when you leave, you're trying to make it in asystem where idle chatter could be about movies or books. Thesepeople don't have any of that social context.''   Low self-esteem is another problem for many trying to break withtheir past, Luce said.   ``You're told within the fold that you're nothing but a worm.Women are worse than that. And, of course, you are told that if youleave the fold, you are an evil person, you are a bad person, adamned person.''   The group has developed a five-step self-help program based onthe Alcoholics Anonymous program. People meet in support groups butcan keep their identities secret.   The group has been criticized by fundamentalist organizationsand is ``No. 1 on Jerry Falwell's hit list,'' said Luce. But MarkDeMoss, a spokesman for the Lynchburg, Va.-based evangelist, saidFalwell was ``basically unconcerned'' about Luce's group.   ``They appear to be about a two-man organization operating outof a church with a telephone number and a post office box number,''DeMoss said in a telephone interview. ``It doesn't appear to bethat big of a deal.''   A spokesman for Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries in Baton Rougedeclined comment on Fundamentalists Anonymous.   ``Reverend Swaggart has specifically asked me not to respond toany criticisms,'' said spokesman Gus Weill.   Swaggart recently was defrocked by the Assemblies of God afterhe refused a one-year suspension from the pulpit over hisconfession of moral failure. A prostitute said Swaggart paid her topose nude for him.   In addition to individual support efforts, the group has beeninvolved in legal efforts by PTL ``lifetime partners'' to recovertheir contributions following Bakker's departure from the ministryover a sex scandal.   Luce, 28, who gave up a career as a bank manager to devote allhis time to Fundamentalists Anonymous, said Swaggart was one of theearliest examples he used of the dangers of fundamentalism. SinceSwaggart's scandal, calls to the group have increased dramatically,he said.   Luce, who described himself as an American Baptist, said he wasfirst exposed to fundamentalism when members of his family becameinvolved in the Pentecostal faith.   ``It caused serious damage when they would tell other members ofthe family that they weren't Christian, they were going to hell,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
