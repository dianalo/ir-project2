Mr. Everett's securities firm, like many on Wall Street,recommends that institutional investors make tobacco stockspart of their portfolios. A senior vice president at a firmshe prefers not be identified, Ms. Everett is also vicechairman of the City University board of trustees. She saysthe board understood that tobacco stocks are among themarket's best performers.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Making money really is not the ultimate answer to allquestions,&quot; Ms. Everett says. &quot;There is a moral issue here.&quot;   City University decided to sell its tobacco stocks. So hasHarvard University. So has Johns Hopkins University.   The moral issue that preoccupied many campuses during the1980s was investments in companies doing business in SouthAfrica. In the 1990s, tobacco may be the issue to pit profitagainst principle.   At Yale University, the University of Texas, theUniversity of Southern California and others, administratorsare asking whether investing in companies that sellcigarettes is inconsistent with their mission to educate,enlighten and improve.   At tobacco companies such as Philip Morris Cos.,executives are lobbying universities and other institutionalinvestors, hoping to persuade doubters that they are goodcitizens as well as good investments.   And even among stock analysts -- where the aim is torecognize profit potential, not social sensitivity -- thereis an acknowledgement that tobacco stocks present a dilemma.   &quot;Being a conscientious objector is the only excuse for notowning this stock,&quot; John McMillin of Prudential Securitiessays of Philip Morris.   Before Johns Hopkins University decided to sell itstobacco investments last month, a committee of its board oftrustees heard from anti-smoking activists and from PhilipMorris Chairman Hamish Maxwell. The board decided: &quot;Theholding of tobacco stocks is incompatible with theuniversity's mission to disseminate information on thetreatment and prevention of disease and illness.&quot;   Johns Hopkins Treasurer William E. Snow Jr. concedes thisdecision could have some financial ramifications for theschool and its $560 million endowment.   &quot;Any divestment has the potential for harming theinvestment return,&quot; Mr. Snow says. &quot;It probably makes it moredifficult for investment managers to manage money.&quot;   While generally reticent about the issue, Philip Morrisnotes that its stock performed better in 1990 than any otherof the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage. &quot;Philip Morris believes that investment decisions byfiduciaries should reflect the judgment of a prudent investorand should not be based on issues of social policy,&quot; thecompany said in a statement.   Johns Hopkins officials explain their decision was aboutneither profits nor politics. They say a financial stake incompanies that sell cigarettes contradicts the school'sefforts to find cures for cancer and heal those afflicted bysmoking-related disease.   The board of trustees &quot;did not do this to make astatement. They did not do this to change policy. They didthis because this is Johns Hopkins,&quot; Mr. Snow says.   Kenneth Kizer, the director of California's Department ofHealth Services, recently urged some of the state's largestpublic and private institutions to divest themselves of morethan $500 million of tobacco company securities. His lettersto the University of Southern California, the University ofCalifornia, Stanford University, the California StateTeachers Retirement System and the California PublicEmployees Retirement System asked them to sell their tobaccostocks &quot;in the interest of promoting health.&quot;   Promoting health is the early agenda at Yale University,where the Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibilitysuggested using the threat of divestment to prompt certainchanges at tobacco companies.   That committee asked the university to require substantialprogress to halt the sales of cigarettes to minors and toplace appropriate warning labels on cigarettes sold overseas.If substantial progress isn't made, the advisory committeerecommended, Yale should consider harsher steps -- including&quot;divestment of the stock of recalcitrant companies.&quot;   Peter Schuck, committee chairman and a professor of law atYale, says, &quot;If we simply divested we would lose any realopportunity to influence the companies as shareholders.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
