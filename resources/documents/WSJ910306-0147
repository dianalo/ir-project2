Crowds of depositors, many panicked by fears they wouldlose their life savings, formed outside closed institutionsas state troopers stood by to maintain order.</LP><TEXT>   Rhode Island officials, who had ordered the institutionsclosed on New Year's Day, initially blamed the embezzlementof $13 million from tiny Heritage Loan andamp; Investment Co.,whose failure had pulled down a private deposit-insurancecompany underpinning 45 banks and credit unions.   But in fact, the crisis had been years in the making. Aslong ago as 1985, a state report explicitly predicted theinsurance system's collapse, warning that &quot;the existing RhodeIsland situation should be tolerated no longer.&quot;   Hoping to avert a calamity, two state legislatorsintroduced bills in 1986 that would have required allinstitutions to get federal deposit insurance, subjectingthem to tighter regulation and putting out of business theprivate insurer that has now collapsed. But the industry hadfriends in all the right places. The head of the committeethat took up the House bill was married to a director of aninstitution covered by the private insurer. The committee'svice chairman headed a credit-union trade group that opposedthe bill. And in the state Senate, a legislator who was anofficial of another institution covered by the privateinsurer made a motion to kill the legislation. It died.   Thus did vested interests, including elected officialswith close ties to the banking and credit-union industry,help block attempts to address the banking problems nowhaunting Rhode Island. The industry's practice of hiringregulators fostered a cozy relationship with institutionsthat the state was supposed to regulate.   Woefully undermanned state bank examiners, able to auditsome institutions only once every few years, failed to haltbig, risky loans to developers or to detect them after theywent sour. And a reluctance to publicize reports warning ofthe system's shaky finances -- for fear of causing bank runs-- allowed the problem to be largely ignored until itexploded.   &quot;The blame for the problem today must be spread -- amongthe legislature, the executive branch, the regulatory branchand the credit unions themselves,&quot; says state Rep. FrancisGaschen, who introduced one of the 1986 bills.   Though about half of the closed institutions havequalified for federal deposit insurance and reopened, most ofthe larger ones remain shut because of their weak financialcondition. More than $1 billion in deposits is frozen,causing hardship for some 350,000 individual and businesscustomers and deepening the state's recession. A bailout planadopted by the state to pay off depositors over several yearscould cost as much as $500 million.   The crisis here has prompted federal regulators to take ahard look at the 20 other states still relying on some formof private deposit insurance. At least five states areworking with U.S. officials to shift to federal depositcoverage. &quot;Rhode Island really got everyone's attention,&quot;comments a spokesman for the National Credit UnionAdministration, a federal agency that insures credit-uniondeposits.   The tragedy, critics say, is that the mess could have beenavoided had steps been taken when cracks first appeared inthe finances of Rhode Island Share andamp; Deposit Indemnity Corp.This is the private organization, known as Risdic, that wasowned by credit unions and small banks and that insured theirdeposits.   Some members of Risdic wanted to grow rapidly, following arisky lending strategy that was more suited to largecommercial banks than traditional credit unions. &quot;These guyswere way, way over their heads,&quot; says Karl F. Ericson, aconsultant to the court-appointed Risdic receiver. As a PeatMarwick accountant, Mr. Ericson expressed concern in 1981about Risdic's financial strength; he rendered a qualifiedopinion of Risdic, noting that the insurer didn't have asufficient reserve set up as a cushion for losses.   Risdic's response? It fired Peat Marwick.   By 1985, Risdic was in the public spotlight for the firsttime. The costly failure of private deposit insurers inMaryland and Ohio caused concern here and elsewhere. NorthCarolina's private thrift insurer voluntarily went out ofbusiness after helping members get federal insurance; otherstates adopted laws requiring federal coverage of deposits.Arlene Violet, then the state attorney general, ordered aninvestigation into Risdic and its members.   In December 1985, the explosive and prophetic findingslanded on her desk. The report listed a litany of woes: Manyinstitutions violated their own loose lending limits, makingtoo many large loans to too few borrowers instead ofspreading their risks through lots of small loans. Too manyloans were going to their own officials and other &quot;insiders.&quot;The institutions weren't recognizing some bad loans; instead,they masked them through accounting gimmickry. Regulation waspoor. At least three institutions -- including MarquetteCredit Union, the largest -- were insolvent, the reportwarned. It found &quot;all sorts of dangerous, indeed recklessmanagement practices&quot; at some of the institutions now closed.   Moreover, the financial condition of Risdic, the insurerof the deposits, was called &quot;highly questionable.&quot; Even aminor bank run could bring down the system, the reportcautioned. A second report, conducted in 1986 for then-Gov.Edward DiPrete, confirmed the first report.   Many officials agreed that the solution was to requireRisdic members to get federal deposit insurance. That's whenthey found out how strong Risdic and its allies were.   In the Senate, such a bill was voted down in committee, ona motion by Sen. John F. Correia -- vice president of aRisdic credit union. He didn't return phone calls seekingcomment. Says John C. D'Amico, the former state senator whointroduced the bill: &quot;Had my bill passed at that time, thiswhole mess would have been averted.&quot;   In a House committee, a similar bill died without even avote. Those presiding: State Rep. Robert S. Tucker, committeechairman and husband of a director of a Risdic credit union,and Rep. Robert Bianchini, committee vice chairman andpresident of the private Credit Union League -- whosedirectors included many Risdic members. &quot;Our argument fell ondeaf ears,&quot; says Rep. Gaschen, who introduced the House bill.&quot;Members of the committee had been lobbied strongly.&quot;   Indeed, Rep. Bianchini had helped coordinate theopposition. Just before the hearing in May 1986, he attendedtwo lobbying dinners for committee members at the exclusiveAurora Club here. Peter Nevola, a former state bankcommissioner who was Risdic's president, used Rep.Bianchini's club membership to reserve rooms.   Rep. Gaschen, an attorney who occasionally representsmortgage customers, says he was indirectly threatened with aloss of business if he pushed the bill further. &quot;Clients ofmine were told they couldn't use me as an attorney because of`that Risdic bill,'&quot; he recalls. Those admonitions stoppedafter he complained to Rep. Bianchini.   Afterward, Robert Bergeron, president of Woodlawn CreditUnion, which had left Risdic for federal insurance in theearly '80s and supported mandatory federal insurance, filed acomplaint against Rep. Bianchini with the state Conflict ofInterest Commission. &quot;The people whose corporation {Risdic}would have been put out of business by this bill were on hisboard of directors {at the credit union league}. They werehis bosses,&quot; Mr. Bergeron says.   The commission voted 4-to-3 that Rep. Bianchini had a&quot;substantial conflict&quot; of interest. But five votes wererequired, so no action was taken against him.   Rep. Bianchini says he didn't act improperly. The billdied, he contends, because there was no compelling reasonoffered for it. Although Atty. Gen. Violet and an aide toGov. DiPrete testified in its favor and referred in generalterms to the two reports, they didn't provide details of justhow serious the situation was.   &quot;Proponents were asked whether there were problemsexisting, whether any institutions had problems,&quot; Rep.Bianchini says. &quot;The response was, `No, the bill was beingpresented to provide preventive medicine.'&quot; Nonetheless, heconcedes, &quot;It was prophetic, no question about it.&quot; Rep.Tucker, Rep. Bianchini's colleague on the House committee,says he can't comment because of complaints pending againsthim at the state ethics commission for not disclosing hiswife's credit-union connection. Mr. Nevola couldn't bereached.   Critics say Gov. DiPrete, who served three terms beforebeing defeated for re-election last November, should havepushed harder or tried again later to address the Risdicproblem. But, he responds, &quot;The credit union lobby was verypowerful in this state, and the bills never got anywhere. Thekey legislative leaders have been closely affiliated with thecredit unions for years, and they didn't want anyonetinkering with Risdic.&quot;                                                                                                          Other Bills Blocked                                                                                                          Indeed, the legislature blocked passage of other billsthat would have toughened regulation of Risdic and the creditunions and banks it insured. &quot;Virtually none of the billsbeing introduced on our behalf ever passed,&quot; says acting BankCommissioner Edward Pare. They included a bill to limit acredit union's loans to a single borrower and another tolimit investments by credit unions in affiliated companies.   To the contrary, the legislature even passed laws that, ineffect, loosened state regulation of Risdic members. One letthe state banking division accept Risdic audits of Risdiccredit unions in lieu of state exams. House Speaker JosephDeAngelis, former legislators say, was a frequent champion ofRisdic's interests. Mr. DeAngelis -- a lawyer who hasrepresented two Risdic institutions and whose firmrepresented the insurer covering Risdic directors -- says hecan't recall specific legislation but acknowledges he &quot;oftenintroduced bills on behalf of agencies or groups including .. . Risdic.&quot;   Wasn't letting Risdic examine its own members akin toletting the fox guard the chicken coop? &quot;That's an accurateassessment,&quot; now concedes Mr. Bianchini, who supported thebill. &quot;The question whether those being regulated should makepolicy decisions regarding that regulation is a valid one.&quot;   In defense of the legislature, Reps. DeAngelis andBianchini note that it passed a law enabling the state toclose troubled institutions and to require individual Risdicmembers to get federal deposit insurance. But Rep. Gaschencalls the law &quot;a sham.&quot; He notes, &quot;If a credit union is introuble, how does {the state} say you have to get federalinsurance? Federal insurance doesn't want them.&quot;   Compounding the legislative meddling in regulation,critics say, was chronic understaffing at the bankingdivision. During the 1980s boom years, state-charteredinstitutions grew rapidly. Assets of Rhode Island CentralCredit Union, one of the largest and now among the mosttroubled institutions, soared to $261.8 million in 1989 fromjust $21.7 million in 1980; assets of Davisville Credit Uniongrew to $156.5 million from just $14.7 million in 1980.   But the number of people doing bank and credit-unionexaminations slipped from 14 or 15 in 1980 to nine last year,Mr. Pare says. &quot;We weren't getting the job done in 1980, andthat was the best year,&quot; he adds. It was often two or threeyears between state examinations, he says.   Adds Edward L. Blue, banking commissioner in the early1980s who also complained about staffing: &quot;With largeinstitutions, it was impossible to do complete exams. Wewould do partial exams. We would have needed a minimum of 30or 35 to do an audit every year.&quot;   With regard to the muddled regulatory apparatus, the 1985report to Atty. Gen. Violet noted, &quot;It is hard to tell wherethe financial institutions, the regulating department andRisdic begin and end.&quot;                                                                                                          Trouble Crops Up                                                                                                          In early 1989, Risdic started to unravel. The first signwas the failure of Jefferson Loan andamp; Investment Co., a smallRisdic bank. Jefferson, with assets of just $13.7 million,lent or invested -- the exact nature of the transaction isthe subject of a legal dispute -- $4.3 million to a leasingcompany. Concentrating nearly one-third of its assets withone borrower violated a basic principle of banking,diversification of risk. When the leasing company failed, itpulled the bank down with it last spring.   Then came the crisis at Heritage, a small bank with just$25 million in assets. Last fall, state bank examiners, intheir first audit of Heritage in 3 1/2 years, found the booksin chaos. Even more troubling, they discovered in a randomcheck with customers that some &quot;borrowers&quot; had never borrowedanything. Instead, investigators now allege, the bogus loansamounted to systematic draining of the bank. Among Heritage'sexecutives: Albert M. Manfredi III, a former chief bankexaminer for the state. Mr. Manfredi couldn't be reached forcomment.   But state examiners weren't the first to discover problemsat Heritage. Risdic, after learning the state planned anaudit, had already sent in its own audit team. Risdicapparently tried to help Heritage President Joseph MolliconeJr. -- a vice chairman of the Risdic board -- reconstructrecords before state examiners arrived, investigators say.   Mr. Mollicone -- who with his wife and Heritage hadcontributed $25,065 to the state's elected officials --disappeared Nov. 8. He hasn't been heard from since.Investigators say he had ties to organized-crime figures,some of whom kept accounts at Heritage. Indeed, about$850,000 remains unclaimed, suggesting that some depositorswould rather not say where they got the money.   News of Mr. Mollicone's disappearance sparked a run onHeritage; and even before that, other Risdic members hadpulled deposits from Heritage. To cover withdrawals, Risdichad to pump more than $14.6 million into the bank. Thatdrained Risdic's reserves, leaving almost nothing to protectmore than $1 billion of deposits at other Risdicinstitutions.                                                                                                          Financing Florida Condos                                                                                                          Even with the collapse of Heritage and Jefferson, Risdic'splight wouldn't have mattered much if its institutions hadbeen well-run and could have applied for and obtained federaldeposit insurance. In fact, after Risdic's problems surfaced,state officials asked federal regulators to consider Risdicmembers for coverage.   In November, a team of federal regulators secretly came toProvidence to do just that. Their findings, however,confirmed the worst fears of Risdic's critics: The problemsat Jefferson and Heritage were symptomatic of theshortcomings at a number of Risdic institutions that had beenpoorly regulated for years.   Marquette Credit Union in Woonsocket, Risdic's biggestmember with assets of $343.9 million at the end of 1989,illustrates the mess they found. Of Marquette's $310.4million of loans, the National Credit Union Administrationsaid $301.3 million -- an astonishing 97% -- should beclassified as substandard, doubtful or loss. Eight borrowersaccounted for $76 million of those loans, and each of themexceeded the credit union's rules limiting loans to oneborrower or group to 25% of capital.   Among the bad loans on its books: a $5.3 million loan toWoonsocket developers for an 88-unit Florida condominiumproject. The loan has some unusual terms: It doesn't requireinterest payments. Instead, Marquette is to share in anyprofits -- which don't exist because Florida's condo marketis in the doldrums.   Paul A. Fontaine, a Marquette depositor whose late fatherhelped start Marquette in the 1940s, has sued Marquette andRisdic for damages in a state court in Providence, allegingmismanagement. A local credit union, Mr. Fontaine contends,&quot;shouldn't lend $5 million to a couple of guys from RhodeIsland trying to build a condo project in Florida. How do yousupervise a project like that? This is a credit union, notChase Manhattan Bank.&quot;   The National Credit Union Administration concludedMarquette's loan-loss allowances should total $41 million,not the $2.3 million shown on its books, and it foundMarquette technically insolvent. Marquette, which remainsclosed, didn't return phone calls seeking comment.                                                                                                          Favors for Big Borrowers                                                                                                          Marquette hardly had a monopoly on bad loans. DavisvilleCredit Union, another large institution, was also rejectedfor federal deposit insurance. Examining its books last April-- about three years after its previous review -- stateregulators found favorable treatment extended to a handful ofbig borrowers and repeated violations of the institution'sown lending policies and state banking rules.   Among other things, they uncovered a messy conflict ofinterest between a big borrower and an executive vicepresident, Wilfred McPeak Jr. The executive approved loansfor a business partner, the same firm that did Davisville'sconstruction mortgage inspections. Regulators say Mr. McPeakbackdated a document to reflect a lower interest rate andlater advanced $45,000 to his partner above and beyondexisting loans to pay &quot;seriously delinquent interest.&quot;   Mr. McPeak, who was asked to leave Davisville lastNovember, says he owns property with the borrower andconcedes that he shouldn't have handled his partner'saccount. But he insists that he himself didn't benefit fromhis actions.   After reviewing Davisville's books last November, the NCUAcited &quot;incomplete {loan} applications, no credit reports,weak appraisals and the lack of analysis of the {borrower's}ability to repay the loans. . . . These loans were not madein a safe and sound manner.&quot; It found Davisville insolvent,with a capital level of negative 10.98% -- instead of thecapital-to-asset ratio of 7.51% it had claimed. Davisville'sacting chief executive, Luigi Del Ponte, declines to comment,citing pending litigation.   In December, Washington regulators gave state officialsthe bad news: Many Risdic members couldn't qualify forfederal insurance. Gov. DiPrete and Gov.elect Sundlun huddledto decide what to do. But a decision was, in effect, made forthem.                                                                                                          The Runs Begin                                                                                                          As word of Risdic's troubles spread, depositors began arun on a couple of institutions. Among those withdrawingmoney: Salvatore Mancini, chairman of the state DemocraticParty, mayor of North Providence -- and director of CentralCredit Union, one of the now-closed institutions. MayorMancini withdrew $150,000 from two credit unions Dec. 27; hedenies any inside knowledge and says he needed the money forvarious purposes. Other politically connected depositors alsomade big withdrawals that week, state officials say. Facedwith a mounting crisis, Gov. Sundlun says he had littlechoice but to close all Risdic members and put Risdic intoreceivership.   What will happen to the 15 still-closed institutions?Although they are seeking a new infusion of capital in hopesof qualifying for federal insurance and reopening, that isconsidered unlikely. Instead, under the state's bailout plan,they are expected to be taken over by the state. Their assetswould be liquidated over several years to help pay offdepositors; any shortfall would be made up by the statethrough taxes or other revenue. A few of the closedinstitutions may be purchased by a healthy Providence bank,probably with federal or state assistance.   Further revelations about the debacle may yet emerge. Apreliminary report to Gov. Sundlun by Vartan Gregorian,president of Brown University in Providence, is expectedsoon. State and federal law-enforcement officials areinvestigating for possible criminal wrongdoing.   A special legislative commission is investigating theaffair, too. But even it got off to a controversial startwhen one of the members appointed to the committee was Sen.Correia, the credit-union executive who opposed mandatoryfederal-deposit insurance in 1986. Only after depositorscomplained about a conflict of interest did Sen. Correiadecide not to serve on the panel.   Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Rhode Islanders stilldon't have access to their accounts. Milton Zotos, who has$30,000 in retirement savings frozen, has got back only $105so far. &quot;I worked 17 years for that money,&quot; he says. &quot;Thestate has a moral responsibility to see people get theirmoney back. They created Risdic -- and they were supposed tobe regulating it.&quot;   ---                           Closed Doors                                                                                                        Assets of the largest closed Rhode Island institutions inmillions of dollars.
