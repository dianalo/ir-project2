Brian Watkins, an annual visitor from Provo, Utah, came backonce too often. He was waiting in a midtown Manhattan stationSunday night when a group of youths robbed his father and punchedhis mother. Watkins fought back, and one of the youths stabbed himto death.   Eight teen-agers were arrested Monday and charged with murderand robbery, police said.   Watkins' slaying was one more disaster for the nation's largestsubway system, which began the century as an engineering marvel andseems destined to end it as a social disaster.   The blood stain in the Seventh Avenue station had faded Tuesday,but not the disgust over what had happened there.   Like Watkins, Dockery Clark of Greensboro, N.C., also came toNew York for the U.S. Open tennis tournament. She said she had beenmugged in the station next to the one where Watkins died.   ``Two guys jumped me, beat my back and stole my watch andbracelet,'' she told the Daily News. ``My boyfriend saw (Mayor)David Dinkins (at the tournament), walked up to him, and told himhis city is a cesspool.''   Carolina Brani, another Open spectator, lives in Milan. But shewas clear about one thing: ``I know the subway is never safe. Dayor night, there is no difference.''   Crime is rising throughout New York City, and rising even fasterin the subways. Last year, subway felonies increased 18 percent,while reported major crimes rose 4 percent in the city as a whole.   Watkins' slaying was the 18th this year in the subway system,versus 20 in all of 1989, and robberies are up 29 percent.   The fact that less than 3 percent of all city crime occurs inthe subways is of scant comfort to most riders.   ``People are not moved by statistics,'' said Thomas Reppetto,director of the Citizens Crime Commission, a privately financedcitizens group. ``Too many things have happened down there to toomany people.''   Brian Watkins was no victim-in-waiting. He had ridden thesubways many times before; he was in the company of four otherpeople, including two men. It was not that late _ midtown at 10:20p.m. is as busy as some cities at noon _ and the station at SeventhAvenue and 53rd Street is not one of the more dangerous.   To many, the brazen attack on the Watkins family merely confirmsa visceral sense of subterranean danger.   Most stations are dirty, smelly, noisy and dimly lit. TheTransit Authority has closed station newsstands, reduced tokenbooth hours and cut off-hours service on some lines.   The agency's police department has been nagged by scandals, andin August it ran out of money in a special city fund for payingovertime for police officers on subway robbery patrol.   ``For a lot of people, to go down into a cavern is a littlefrightening, no matter what,'' said Reppetto. ``But when they seehomeless people living there and disorderly people, they feel thatthings are not under control.''   After steadily increasing for several years, ridership hasdeclined. Only about a quarter of city residents ride the subwayeach day, and to many such a trip has become virtually unthinkable.A few years ago then-Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward admitted hiswife had never taken the subway.   During the past five years graffiti has been vastly reduced.Trains are more punctual, and the Transit Authority has severalbillion dollars to spend on further improvements. ``The level ofservice used to be intolerable,'' said Gene Russianoff, a masstransit advocate. ``Now it's tolerably bad.''   But many riders, past and present, feel that what really makesthe subways dangerous are some of the people in them, people ascallous as the ones who allegedly attacked the Watkins family andthen headed off to the Roseland ballroom for some dancing.   ``There are a lot of proposals out there for improving safety inthe subways,'' said Russianoff. ``I'm afraid none of them wouldhave helped Mr. Watkins.''</TEXT></DOC>
