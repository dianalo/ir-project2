In several lawsuits across the country, investors haveaccused First Executive and its chairman, Fred Carr, ofplaying a role in an alleged scheme to manipulate thejunk-bond market. The lawsuits allege that First Executiveand other big junk-bond players bought and sold thesecurities at Mr. Milken's bidding, thus artificiallyinflating the value of the bonds, according to documentsfiled by creditors.</LP><TEXT>   In federal court in Manhattan, Continental filed a suitasking the court to declare that First Executive'sgeneral-liability insurance from Continental doesn't coverdefense costs or damages that might stem from thesecurities-fraud cases. Continental said First Executiverequested on Feb. 20 that the insurer cover the defense costsof First Executive and Mr. Carr.   Continental's move is similar to steps it took in Decemberagainst Wickes Cos., which has been named as a defendantalong with Mr. Milken in other securities-fraud cases. Mr.Milken last year pleaded guilty to six felonies related tosecurities transactions and recently began serving his prisonsentence.   Continental maintains that it doesn't have to defend FirstExecutive in the investor suits because the policy doesn'tcover any &quot;willful violation&quot; of the law. The investor suits&quot;all allege willful, knowing and malicious violation offederal and state securities laws and {the RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations law} by {FirstExecutive}, alone and in conspiracy with the other nameddefendants,&quot; Continental said in its suit.   A spokesman for First Executive, a Los Angeles-basedinsurance holding company, couldn't be reached for comment.   Last week First Executive announced that it had a loss of$465.9 million in the last quarter of 1990 and that auditorswere questioning whether the company can continue operating.Although the junk-bond suits aren't directly linked to FirstExecutive's current woes, the investors' suits claim thatFirst Executive's junk-bond dealings weakened its financialcondition.   The Continental's case against Wickes is pending. Wickeshas asked a federal judge in Manhattan to move the case toCalifornia, where Wickes is based.   ---   NEW JERSEY PASSED an unusual declaration of death law.   The state passed the nation's first law requiring doctorsto consider a patient's religious beliefs before declaringthe patient &quot;brain dead&quot; and removing life-sustainingequipment.   The law states that patients who have permanently lost allbrain functions are legally dead, unless there are religiousobjections. If objections exist death will be defined by thetraditional criteria of irreversible loss of breathing andheartbeat.   New Jersey is the 49th state to acknowledge the cessationof all brain functions as a legal definition of death, thusallowing doctors to disconnect patients from life-sustainingequipment. South Dakota has not passed such a law.   Several lawyers said that the religious exemption willlikely be copied by other states. &quot;The law is unprecedentedin that it does two things: recognizes neurological deathwhile respecting those who adhere on religious grounds to thetraditional cardiopulmonary definition of death,&quot; said PaulArmstrong, chairman of the New Jersey bioethics commission.&quot;Within 20 hours of the signing, we've already had inquiriesfrom around the nation and even from Japan about it.&quot;   Sanford J. Schlesinger, a New York trust and estateslawyer, said &quot;There are a lot of issues in the areas ofright-to-die and medical self-determination which needlegislative attention, and this law addresses an importantaspect of it.&quot;   But some attorneys stressed that the religious exemptionwas an area fraught with controversy. In New Jersey theexemption was taken out of the bill at one point in responseto heavy lobbying from the state's medical and legalcommunities. Doctors and lawyers worried they would have totrack down evidence of a patient's beliefs. The law nowstates that a doctor is responsible for considering religiousbeliefs, only if the beliefs are stated in the patient'smedical records or if a relative or close friend tells thedoctor.   The law bars insurance companies from discriminatingagainst patients who are kept alive because of theirreligious beliefs. It also bars transplant surgeons anddoctors whose patients need organ transplants from making adeclaration of death for a potential donor, thus eliminatingpotential conflicts of interest.   &quot;From the point of view of hospitals, we hope that a lawlike this will encourage people to stipulate what they wouldwant to happen if they are ever in a situation where theirlives are maintained by medical technology alone,&quot; said LindaDolan, vice president of patient care services at PassaicBeth Israel Hospital in Passaic, N.J.   ---   DREXEL'S FORMER CHIEF indicated he may end up consultingfor the FDIC.   According to documents filed in federal bankruptcy courtin Manhattan, former chief executive and current board memberFrederick Joseph said in early January that after leavingDrexel he could end up working as a consultant to the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp.   A spokesman for the FDIC said he was unaware of anyproposed consulting arrangement.   Mr. Joseph's comments, which a Drexel Burnham LambertGroup Inc. spokesman described as &quot;off-the-cuff,&quot; came in aninterview with management consultants from Towers PerrinForster andamp; Crosby. Towers Perrin recently completed a reportrecommending a managementcompensation package for Drexel'scurrent employees.   The FDIC is suing Drexel for allegedly causing billions ofdollars of losses in the thrift industry through themanipulation of the junk-bond market. Mr. Joseph is named asa defendant in those suits because he was a &quot;controllingperson&quot; responsible for the company's actions.   The Drexel spokesman said that at the time of Mr. Joseph'scomments, Jan. 8., the former chief executive hadn't made anycontact with the FDIC over any future consulting role. &quot;Hewas pontificating on what would happen if for some reason thefirm bounced him out,&quot; the Drexel spokesman said.   David Boies, an attorney for the FDIC at the New York lawfirm Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore who has been working on theDrexel litigation, said, &quot;I don't think there are any currentplans for the FDIC to hire him as a consultant.&quot; The courtfiling also said that Mr. Joseph indicated he intended tostep down as a Drexel executive but was likely to continue asa consultant to the company.   Drexel's proposed reorganization plan is expected to bepresented to creditors next week.   ---   SAN FRANCISCO LAW FIRM to reopen Kuwait office.   Michael Cavanaugh, chairman of Graham andamp; James' executivecommittee, said the 400-lawyer firm will reopen the officeMay 15. At the time of the Iraqi invasion, Graham andamp; James wasthe only U.S. law firm with an office in Kuwait. Sevenlawyers worked in the office. Three lawyers will reopen thebranch.   Mr. Cavanaugh said the office will handle continuingcontract and arbitration matters that were in progress beforethe invasion; contracting work obtained by clients involvingthe reconstruction of Kuwait; and questions aboutinternational law.   The invasion and war in the Persian Gulf may change thelegal landscape as well. The difficulty in obtaining visasmeans the law firm may hire Kuwaiti lawyers. And Mr.Cavanaugh said the law firm expects to do more work for U.S.and British companies as Kuwait does more business with itsGulf war allies.   ---   ATTORNEY GENERAL Dick Thornburgh will argue before theSupreme Court.   Mr. Thornburgh will make a second unusual appearance,having last argued in the high court in favor of governmentdrug testing programs in November 1988.   The attorney general will argue for 10 minutes as afriend-of-the-court on April 24 in favor of allowing juriesin murder cases to consider prosecution evidence about thevictim's character and family when deciding whether to imposethe death penalty. The case, to be heard on the last day oforal arguments for the court term, is an appeal by aTennessee inmate who was sentenced to death for the murder ofa mother and daughter after the jury considered evidence ofthe effect of the crime on the murdered woman's survivingson.   The high court has ruled twice in recent years that theuse of such evidence inflames the jury and violates theconstitutional rights of defendants in death penalty cases.Both were 5-4 rulings, and the makeup of the court haschanged, with Justice William Brennan, a member of themajority, replaced by Justice David Souter.</TEXT></DOC>
