In addition to hormonal deficiency multiplefactors may play a role in the development of skeletal demineralization.The effect of certain dietary factors such as calcium, phosphorus andprotein, as well as the effect of several drugs was investigated on mineralmetabolism. In studies of the calcium requirement, the amount of calciumneeded to achieve calcium equilibrium or a positive balance was determined.Increasing the phosphorus intake by a factor of 2.5 led to a decreasein urinary calcium irrespective of the calcium intake; there was no adverseeffect on the calcium balance nor on the intestinal absorption of calcium.A high protein intake, given as meat, did not affect urinary or fecalcalcium nor the calcium balance in contrast to the effect of purifiedproteins which induce an increase in urinary calcium and calcium loss.Several drugs such as aluminum-containing antacids, certain diuretics,certain antibiotics, corticosteroids and antituberculosis drugs and thyroidmedications induced a distinct increase in urinary calcium and some ofthese also caused fecal calcium loss. Advanced osteoporosis has beenobserved in the authors patients who have consumed excess alcohol forprolonged periods of time. In view of the widespread use of alcohol andof the drugs mentioned above their long-term use singly or combined wouldbe expected to lead to calcium loss and would thereby increase the calciumrequirement.</TEXT></DOC>
