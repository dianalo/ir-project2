In 1986, the integrated gas company posted net income of $2.11 a share, though that will be restated to $2.16 to reflect an accounting change.    George A. Davidson Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that he was upbeat about the numbers, especially given that relatively low market prices continue to beset the natural gas industry. &quot;We're suffering like everybody else through this soft pricing period,&quot; he said, adding that he believes prices soon will turn around.    Looking ahead, Mr. Davidson said he expects 1988 to be aided by colder-than-normal weather this winter following five warmer-than-usual years. He wouldn't project specific earnings for this year, although analysts anticipate the company will post a profit of about $2.68 a share.    Meanwhile, Consolidated will continue to aggressively pursue the exploration side of the business -- a strategy, Mr. Davidson said, that will put the company in excellent position for a price rebound.    About 56% of this year's $426 million capital budget, announced in December, will be devoted to exploration and production. That, Mr. Davidson said, will allow the company to drill as many as 500 wells, up from 393 in 1987.    He also said he was pleased by the firm's 1.2 trillion cubic feet in gas reserves and 31 million barrels in oil reserves at year end, both records, and by the fact that distribution to industrial customers rose in 1987 for the first time in four years.    Mr. Davidson cited Consolidated's long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of 28.3%, low by industry standards, for the company's bold approach. He said he also expects no long-term financing in 1988.    In addition, he said the distribution side of the company was ready for an acquisition. &quot;We've gone beyond looking,&quot; he said. &quot;We've been in communication.&quot; He declined to be more specific.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Consolidated closed at $37.75, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
