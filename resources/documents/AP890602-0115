Ismet Ismailogllu was renamed Ilko Ilzev Panov. His right legand back are scarred _ marks he says he suffered during a policeattack for his resistance to the name change.   The two, attending a human rights conference here, are amonghundreds of ethnic Turks expelled last month by Bulgaria forresisting an assimilation campaign.   The campaign went into force in 1984. It reportedly includesbanning the use of the Turkish language in public, closing mosques,and razing Turkish cemeteries _ in short, wiping out any trace ofthe Moslem Turkish minority.   ``Now, everyone has an identity card with a Bulgarian name,''said a Turkish delegate to the Paris conference, speaking oncondition he not be named. ``Officially, the Turks no longerexist.''   Bulgaria is becoming a prime target at the monthlong Conferenceon the Human Dimension, the first of three such meetings mandatedin January during a session of the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe.   The United States and other countries are expected to demandthat Bulgaria account for what Turkish Foreign Minister MesutYilmaz has called ``one of the gravest human rights violations ofour time.''   Bulgaria has repeatedly denied charges it oppresses its Turkishminority, estimated to number 900,000 to 1.5 million in a totalpopulation of 9 million. President Todor Zhivkov said such reportsare a ``campaign of slander'' concocted by Turkey and Westerngroups.   The plight of ethnic Turks in Bulgaria has been gainingattention since early May, when unrest over the assimilationcampaign broke out. Official Bulgarian reports say three peopledied last weekend in clashes. But reports from deported ethnicTurks put the death toll at about 30.   Amnesty International says about 100 ethnic Turks have diedsince the assimilation campaign began.   Six expelled Bulgarian Turks are attending the Paris conference.They are demanding that Bulgaria restore the rights of ethnic Turksto practice their cultural heritage or, at least, allow them tofreely leave the country.   Habib Ibisoglu, a former member of Parliament from the port cityof Varna, said he left Bulgaria as a tourist in 1986 and neverreturned.   ``I wanted to speak of Turkish problems in Bulgaria ... and theywouldn't let me,'' he said. ``I left to speak on the outside.''   Mumin Gencoglu, president of the Federation of Balkan Turks andAssociations for Emigres and Refugees, says various Turkish groupstook in about 500 expelled Bulgarian Turks in May. Those expelledoften arrive in Turkey without money, possessions or family.   ``Bulgaria is my country, but I wasn't happy there,'' MissIbrahimoglu said in an interview. ``Bulgaria was for me like anartificial mother. It wasn't my real mother. I was a second-classcitizen.''   Miss Ibrahimoglu, 30, a language student from the village ofKliment near the northeastern town of Shumen, said she was given anew name and identity card on March 12, 1985.   ``I wanted to leave Bulgaria after this,'' she said through aninterpreter. Arrested in Bucharest, Romania in front of the TurkishEmbassy, she was returned home, tried for leaving the countryillegally and sentenced to prison in Sliven.   ``We worked, the food was terrible and when they caught mespeaking Turkish with other women, I was put alone in a cell,'' shesaid.   She then spent two years in internal exile in a town 250 milesfrom her village. When the two years were up, she joined a humanrights group, which she says was the reason she was expelled Feb. 3.   She now lives in Turkey with her mother and brother, who werepermitted to leave with her.   Ismet Ismailogllu, expelled May 25, raises the leg of his pantsto show fresh wounds from what he says are the jaws of a policedog. Other marks run down his back, the remnants of a beating hesays he received May 22 when military police raided his district inKurdzhali, in southern Bulgaria.   Ismailogllu, 35, who worked as an accountant at a governmentcooperative, was secretary of a solidarity and human rights groupfor ethnic Turks.   ``All the members of the association were beaten,'' he said.After the raid, they were forbidden to leave their homes, ``so wedidn't even know if someone next door was dead or alive.''   ``I will try now to love Turkey as my country,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
