Shultz will make a fifth trip tothe Middle East this year to push his plan for Arab-Israelinegotiations.   Sheik Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah wished Shultz well and joinedEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak as the only Arab leaders to openlyendorse the plan.   However, the prime minister called also for establishment of aPalestinian state and for participation of the Palestine LiberationOrganization in the negotiations.   Sheik Saad, who is also crown prince of the Persian Gulfcountry, said the continued ``uprising'' of Palestinian Arabs onthe Israeli-held West Bank and in Gaza was ``a strong exhibition ofthe determination of the Palestinians to regain their freedom.''   About 200 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed inclashes since last December.   Shultz's plan does not call for a Palestinian state, nor for PLOparticipation in the talks unless it recognizes Israel's right toexist and disavows terrorism.   He has made four trips to the Middle East this year to try topromote negotiations between Israel and a mixed delegation ofJordanians and Palestinians and run into resistance from IsraeliPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, King Hussein of Jordan and the PLO.   Shamir refused to participate in a peace conference held partlyunder Soviet auspices, Hussein wanted a guarantee that Israel wouldrelinquish the West Bank and Gaza, and the PLO barred Palestiniansfrom meeting with Shultz.   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said she knew of``no plans'' for Shultz to return to the region. And yet, sherecalled ``the secretary has always said that he would be availableto return to the Middle East if it would be useful in pursuit ofthe peace initiative.''   Sheik Saad, on a week-long visit here, met on Tuesday withPresident Reagan and on Monday with Defense Secretary Frank C.Carlucci and Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead.   Shultz is o a trip to the Far East. He plans to go to CentralAmerica and South America in early August, attend the Republicannational convention in mid-month and take a vacation before LaborDay. He would then have until January to try to his hand at``shuttle diplomacy'' again.   Sheik Saad, in a speech and a press conference, renewed Kuwait'srequest for U.S. air-to-ground Maverick missiles as part of a $1.8billion arms purchase from the United States that would include 40F-18 jet fighter planes.   The Senate has voted to block the Mavericks, viewing them as apotential threat to Israel's security. Sheik Saad said Kuwait was``a peace-loving country'' and wanted the arms for self-defense.   ``It doesn't mean we intend to invade any other country,'' theArab leader said.   Over the weekend, Kuwait annouced an arms deal with the SovietUnion. ``So,'' Sheik Saad said, ``don't be surprised when you readtomorrow or next week or next month that Kuwait also has boughtmilitary equipment from Moscow, or Britain or France.''   He scheduled meetings with members of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee to try to reverse the opposition to theMavericks.</TEXT></DOC>
