The minearea is characterised by high external gamma-ray levels, radioactivedust concentrations and radon daughters levels in the air. This impliesthat annual doses of some individuals are about 5mSv which is the presentAustralian public limit. The present annual collective dose equivalentto members of the public visiting the area was evaluated about 0.42 manSv, and the 100 years collective dose commitment is calculated to beabout 260 man Sv. Since the new Australian public limit is going to be1mSv/y, for exposures extending over many years, more members of thepublic will be exposed above the limit in the future. Four rehabilitationoptions ranged from a general clean-up burial and stabilisation to fullrehabilitation and revegetation have been considered. The ALARA/costbenefit analysis was used to find the optimum rehabilitation option whichhas an associated cost of A$2.13 million. The present collective dosecommitment is going to be reduced by a factor of 7 provided the rehabilitationtakes place. There also will be no likelyhood that individuals will beexposed above the new public limit of 1mSv/y in the future.</TEXT></DOC>
