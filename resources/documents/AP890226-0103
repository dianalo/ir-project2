The Texas Banking Department believes the idea would save thegovernment money and prevent some banks from failing.   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. policy requires that stockholderslose all their equity whenever the agency advances money to prop upa troubled bank.   ``We think it's important that public money not be provided forshareholders,'' FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said.   The FDIC's policy applies both to routine bank failures and toopen-bank assistance transactions, in which private capital combineswith government money to save a bank. The banking departmentproposal would apply only to open-bank deals.   The banking department believes the proposal would give a failingbank's owners incentive to raise private money, thereby reducing theFDIC's costs.   ``If you can get ahead of some of these problems before the bankcloses, it can't help but be cheaper for the system,'' said SteveScurlock, deputy banking commissioner.   Scurlock presented the plan to U.S. Rep. Steve Bartlett of Dallasfor consideration. Bartlett said he notified FDIC Chairman L.William Seidman about the plan and discussed stockholder bailoutswith him.   The banking department hopes the proposal is considered as partof President Bush's bill to rescue failing savings and loans.   Under the proposal, bank management also would receive additionalincentive to save a failing bank. The proposal would allow a bank'stop managers to keep their jobs instead of automatically losing themas dictated by current FDIC policy.   The FDIC had no comment on the plan, Whitney said.   He said the FDIC occasionally has provided existing shareholderswith a stake in a recapitalized bank. In the case of last year'srescue of First City Bancorp. of Texas, for instance, shareholderskept a 2 percent stake in the new First City.   The banking department proposal specifies that existingstockholders suffer more dilution of their ownership than in casesin which private sources inject all the fresh capital. But the plandoes not specify how much dilution, only that is it considerable.   Bartlett believes the existing open-bank assistance law gives theFDIC a powerful vehicle to raise private capital for failing banks,but the FDIC inadequately uses the law.</TEXT></DOC>
