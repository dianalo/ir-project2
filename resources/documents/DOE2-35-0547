The X-ray spectra are well described by a power-law modelwith a low-energy cutoff consistent with photoelectric absorption withinthe Galaxy. The best-fit values of the energy spectral index in the 0.2-4.0keV band are 0.91 and 0.76 respectively. The X-ray flux from OJ 287 isvariable by a ratio of three from low to high state; PKS 0735+178 showsno indication of X-ray variability. The X-ray emission in OJ 287 is interpretedto be due to the synchrotron process from a volume common with eithera beamed radio component or a stationary optical component. In PKS 0735+178,where the X-ray emission is most likely due to the Compton process operatingin one of the VLBI radio components. The synchrotron self-Compton processwith modest kinematic Doppler factors predicts the measured X-ray fluxfrom PKS 0735+178 and lower than the measured flux in OJ 287. 64 references.</TEXT></DOC>
