On Fox Broadcasting Inc.'s &quot;The Late Show,&quot; the future is now.    As you may remember, &quot;The Late Show&quot; was the talk program that got off to a slam-bang start last October when Joan Rivers walked out on her &quot;Tonight&quot; guest slot to compete head-to-head with her mentor, Johnny Carson. But the show flopped after only a few months. Ms. Rivers, the queen of kvetch, is a heavy dish, a sort of Beef Wellington -- great once, but no way you'd want it every night. So last month, when the lady asked &quot;Can we talk?&quot; Fox, quite astutely, said: &quot;No.&quot;    That left the fledgling network in a hole, hostless and in the dark. Fox reasoned that it would be impossible to pick one person who could challenge Johnny Carson. Merv had failed. Dick had failed. Alan was gone so fast, he didn't even have time to fail, and I bet you can't remember his last name.    Johnny, after all, has defined the late-night talk show in America for the past quarter-century, with his low-key, ever so slightly off-color, Nebraskan plain-folks approach. When it comes to chat, he's the best.    In fact, one might well ask why try to compete with him at all? Money, that's why. Talk shows are price performers. Unlike the $800,000 budget for an average one-hour drama, or the $2 million-plus that a &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode gobbles up, it costs only $100,000 per talk show. All you need are a desk and a sofa, and you're in business.    So what Fox decided to do was concede the host issue -- or rather redefine it, by going for variety, someone different each night. Now that's a fun idea. Some recent nights, for example, featured Martin Sheen and Suzanne Somers and Chicano comic Paul Rodriguez. Each night was distinct, each night intriguing enough to get you to tune in.    But if the idea was great, the actuality needed work. All these different stars, night after night, proved it's a lot harder to host a show than you'd think. Mr. Sheen, for example, was nervous. He kept saying he was nervous. He made me nervous. And why they had this poor nervous dramatic actor do a comic monologue is tough to figure out.    Ms. Somers appeared in a leather outfit that was all legs and cleavage (&quot;bolero bimbo&quot;), and asked actor Perry King, &quot;Are some actresses better kissers than others?&quot; Now Ms. Somers keeps insisting she has a brain, and I'm more than willing to believe her, but it seems to be the only significant part of her she's unwilling to show the public.    Mr. Rodriguez was genuinely funny with his offbeat Latino humor: his imitation of an iguana in heat, his velvet paintings on the wall, his low-rider host chair. He even had a flair for presenting his visitors: &quot;It's more than just a pleasure, it's an obsession to introduce my next guest, actress Saundra Santiago.&quot;    But once they were sitting next to him, his guests couldn't get a word in edgewise. &quot;I feel so Julio Iglesias tonight,&quot; he'd butt in. &quot;Let's skip all these questions,&quot; he interrupted Ms. Santiago at one point. &quot;What's your phone number?&quot; Like many of these one-shot guest hosts, Mr. Rodriguez didn't know the cardinal rule of interviewing: Shut up and listen.    My advice to Director David Grossman and Executive in Charge of Production Courtney P. Conte: Stock up on the Valium. Funny hosts are fine. But let's also hear what the guests have to say.    Also, give them some real questions to answer. Asking football great Howie Long, &quot;Do you like being big?&quot; does not rate. Nor does &quot;What's your biggest muscle?&quot; The show has an unfortunate Joan Rivers holdover, a tendency to go for embarrassingly cheap jokes about sex or fat people or worm cookies. Good talk is enough.    Of course, that's not as simple as it sounds. Yet Mr. Sheen, for all his nervousness, did project intelligence and an obvious interest in his guests. He had a big affectionate bear hug for old friends like Kris Kristofferson. He had real political and social passion for the message of homeless crusader Mitch Snyder. And though it was bizarre to see former President Jimmy Carter on a talk show -- talking seriously about Mideast peace and about negotiating with the Soviets between plugs for TV sitcoms -- the interview turned out to be thoughtful and provocative because Mr. Sheen was listening, and obviously cared about the future of the arms race.    Now this format of rotating hosts is one interesting experiment, going as it does against the traditional wisdom of talk shows. (Take one host and make him a family friend, someone whose personality gives an identity to the show, someone the country feels comfortable with night after night.)    To make the format pay off, Fox is going to have to work extra hard. It is going to have to get better hosts, and better guests -- the offbeat, the witty, the lively, the raconteurs. It'll have to avoid choices like Emmanuel Lewis and Cosby kid Malcolm-Jamal Warner (slated for coming weeks) and go after Peter O'Toole, Spaulding Gray, Robin Williams, Magic Johnson, John McEnroe, Paul Simon, William Buckley, Gore Vidal, David Byrne, Mel Brooks -- people who are blazingly articulate, people with an ax to grind. They'll have to get the best. Talk is cheap, but it isn't easy.    ---   Mr. Goldberg watches television in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
