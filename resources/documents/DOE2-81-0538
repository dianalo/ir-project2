Digital image processing can be employed to quantifymass and flux size distribution via histogram analysis and two dimensionalFast Fourier Transforms, respectively. Issues regarding spatial variationof the x-ray field and reproducibility are discussed. It is proposedthat superior speed and resolution may be achieved via optical imageprocessing techniques. In addition to true mass distribution measurement,the technique has several other advantages and potential uses. Formationcan be assessed independently of sheet color. Stickies and other contaminantsare easily quantified. The quality of internal layers in multilayer sheetscan be assessed. These and other practical applications are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
