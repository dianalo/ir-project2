Bureau of Labor Statistics.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Bureau of Labor Statistics regularly surveys U.S.andP;  businesses to gatherdata on company child-care policies, drug testing plans, job openings andother activities.andM;But rapidly changing business addresses and phone numbers pose problems forthe bureau.andM;For that reason, the bureau buys commercial CD-ROM lists of business names,addresses and phone numbers from companies such as Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp. ofNew York, and American Business Information of Omaha, Neb.andM;&quot;We really use them to refine the address sample files that we already have,&quot;said Brendan Powers, chief of Federal and State Monthly Surveys in thebureau's Office of Technology and Survey Processing.andM;Powers' survey division runs American Business Information's BusinessLists-on-Disc as a non-networked application on an 8-MHz IBM Corp. AT with a30M hard drive and external CD-ROM drive from Hitachi America Ltd. of SanBruno, Calif.andM;In some cases, the government's own database contains more accurate StandardIndustrial Codes and employment information than the commercial lists, Powerssaid.andP;  But the bureau is willing to pay for up-to-date telephone numbers andbusiness addresses on CD-ROM, he said.andM;Commercial business lists published on CD-ROM save the time and effort ofemployees not only in the Labor Department but also those in the InternalRevenue Service, the CIA and the Environmental Protection Agency who needup-to-date business information.andM;The government's use of commercial business data has gone up as it has becomeavailable on optical media at a price that permits organizations to put huge,nationwide databases on a micro, said Bill Kerrey, vice president of AmericanBusiness Information's Optical Products Division.andM;Kerry's company sells its CD-ROM database.andP;  Business Lists-on-Disc, for$2,000 a year to government agencies and commercial businesses.andP;  The samedatabase on magnetic tape reels sells for $150,000 to $175,000 a year.andM;Business Lists-on-Disc lits 9.2 million U.S.andP;  businesses, which subscriberscan search electronically by a number of index fields, including number ofemployees, area code, zip code, county code, metropolitan statistical areaand SIC code.andM;One Disk Does ItandM;The 650M database fits onto one CD-ROM disk, which is how the manufacturerwants to keep it.andM;&quot;Most systems are set up so it is easier to use one disk instead of twodisks,&quot; Kerrey said.andM;Federal and state agency subscribers have virtually unlimited use of theBusiness Lists-on-Disc database, Kerrey said.andP;  &quot;What we really try to preventis list brokers using the product to resell the data multiple times,&quot; hesaid.andM;As more and more organizations, including federal agencies, use thecommercial lists, they will demand more frequent updates, Kerrey said.andP;  For$2,800, the company offers updates of its Business Lists-on-Disc as often asevery six months.andM;American Business Information employs 600 people in Omaha.andP;  They use theYellow Pages of more than 4,800 telephone directories to compile and updatethe U.S.andP;  business database.andM;The Business Lists-on-Disc package runs under MS-DOS and requires 1M ofavailable hard-drive storage.andM;Federal agencies buy it through Fedlink, a contract administered by theLibrary of Congress.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
