Officer Edward Byrne, 22, killed as he sat in his patrol carearly Friday, was guarding the home of a Queens man who complainedto authorities about neighborhood crack dealers, authorities said.   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward called it ``a deliberateassassination'' and an ``attempt to intimidate not just thatwitness but all'' who cooperate with police against drug dealers.   ``An attack on a cop is an attack on society,'' said MayorEdward I. Koch, adding that the city was offering a $10,000 rewardfor information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killeror killers.   A private group calling itself Citizens Outraged at Police BeingShot and the Daily News offered an additional $10,000 each.   A confidential, 24-hour hotline was established for tips. Policesaid that one or more people had seen part of the attack, whichtook place in a residential area beset with cocaine trafficking andviolence related to turf wars between drug dealers.   Witnesses told police that two men pulled up to Byrne's cruiserin a car. One got out, approached the patrol car, then quicklyfired five shots into the vehicle before fleeing with the other man.   The man being protected had a firebomb thrown through his windowafter he provided information that led to the arrest in November ofa young man suspected of dealing crack, authorities said. Twoothers were arrested in connection with the firebombing, and twomore were arrested on charges stemming from threats made againstthe homeowner.   The 40-year-old man, a Guyanese immigrant who goes by the singlename Arjune, said Friday that he has moved his family from thehouse, which he has been unsuccessfully trying to sell.   ``I heard the shots. ... I can't say anything. ... I'm scared todeath, in fear for my life,'' he said Friday.   Ward dismissed speculation that Friday's killing was related tothe sentencing Thursday of Lorenzo ``Fat Cat'' Nichols, the reputedhead of a drug empire in southeast Queens.   Nichols, 29, was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life for 11narcotics and gun convictions.   Police in recent years have tried to respond to the growing drugtrade in southeast Queens, launching a major drug sweep known as``Operation Cleanup'' in September 1985. In its first two years, itresulted in 400 felony drug arrests and 225 misdemeanor arrests,along with seizure of 85 firearms and 30 pounds of cocaine.   The slaying cast a pall over a promotion ceremony Friday for 91people at Police Headquarters.   ``Each of us enters this job with full knowledge of the inherentdanger, but we do not expect to be gunned down in this manner,''Ward told the crowd.   Byrne, whose father is a retired police lieutenant and whoseolder brother is a federal prosecutor, was single and lived withhis parents in the Long Island city of Massapequa. He had been apolice officer less than two years.</TEXT></DOC>
