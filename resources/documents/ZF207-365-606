 The first is thegrowing interest in CALS, not only among the DoD suppliers but in commercialindustries as well.andP;  Perhaps newspaper and magazine publishers will neverhave to conform to MIL-STD-1840A or grapple with CGM graphics, but commercialbook publishers may well adopt SGML for the same reason as the DoD: itprovides a long-term growth path beyond the current generation of hardwareand software.andM;The second theme was articulated in the opening session of the first seminar(New Technologies: Building on the Fourth Wave, covered in our last issue ofthis Report).andP;  Both Jean-Louis Gassee of Apple and Dave Liddle of Metaphortalked about a future where end users customize and fashion their owntools--in effect being their own system integrators.andP;  Judging from whatuser-speakers said in the seminar sessions and in the evening In-Plant bullsession, users (at least those who self-selected themselves to come to thisyear's Seminar) have largely accepted the fact that they are responsibletoday for pulling together and refining their own solutions.andP;  This theme maywell emerge as one of the domainant issues of publishing in the '90s.andM;CALS: blessing or curse?andM;Over the past coupole of years, the Computer-aided Acquisition and LogisticsSupport (CALS) initiative at the U.S.andP;  Department of Defense has emerged fromthe shadows to dominate the thinking and actions of the traditional tech-docvendors.andP;  Dave Becker of Boeing, who spoke at last year's Seminars,contributed his overview of the CALS standards to our Report last September(Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  2).andM;By this year's Seminar, it was becoming increasingly clear that CALS willhave an impact that spreads far beyond the defense industry.andP;  The CALSsession at this year's Seminars offered three perspectives: that of the U.S.andO;Air Force's chief CALS tester, Mel Lammers; that of a vendor affected by CALS(Richard Quinn of Eastman Kodak); and that of an &quot;interested observer,&quot; FrankGilbane, who is part of the standards committee efforts to chisel the CALSrequirements into actual standards.andM;Testing begins.andP;  Mel Lammers, the deputy director and Technology SupportDirectorate manager of the CALS Test Network (CTN) out of Wright-PattersonAir Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, gave a briefing on the progress of the CALSValidation and Verification Strategy.andP;  (For those new to CALS, the militaryassigns everything as complex a name as possible--that way it can have aneven more cryptic acronym associated with it.)andP;  The CTN is an effort bygovernment agencies, vendors and contractors to test how well the standardshold up the actual application--interchanging information among heterogeneoussystems--and to recommend changes in the spec and future specifications basedon the results of the tests.andM;Testing is taking place right now on a piece-by-piece basis; that is, eachstandard (text, graphics and images) is being tested separately using sampledocuments that contain most of the different elements that might be in a realdocument.andP;  McDonnell-Douglas is the first contractor to begin putting actualweapon manuals (for the F15E fighter) on the test network.andP;  Pratt-Whitneyintends to test F100 engine manuals later this year.andP;  Validating the initialspecifications will take several years to complete, including the revisionsto the specs that correct earlier shortcomings.andM;Reaction from the commercial industry.andP;  It is clear that the government willultimately benefit from the implementation of CALS.andP;  Documentation for weaponsystems that have service lives extending upward of 20 or 30 years will bemade available and updated in a vendor-independent format.andP;  Costly ascompliance is for vendors and contractors, they have no choice but to complyif they intend to compete.andM;But should the rest of the publishing industry--those involved in corporate,in-plant, and commercial publishing that have nothing to do with the U.S.andO;government--abide by the CALS model for information exchange as well?andP;  Thatquestion was addressed by the next two speakers, who pointed out why we mightwant to (or in some cases be forced to) pay attention to the CALS model.andP;  Thefirst reason is fairly straightforward: although only prime contractors arecurrently affected by the CALS requirement, it is &quot;only a matter of time&quot;before the requirement spills over onto subcontractors, according to FrankGilbane.andP;  Although this currently isn't legislated, the contractors are boundto make the incentive irresistible (along the lines of &quot;comply or don't dowork for me&quot;).andP;  Given the fact that hundreds of companies can be involved ina government contract in a subcontractor capacity, CALS could potentiallyreach deep into the heart of corporate America, as well as into theinternational market, since NATO is thinking of adopting the CALS standards,too.andM;Dick Quinn reflected a complaint in the vendor community in presenting thecase that CALS compliance may be as much curse as blessing: CALS complianceis very expensive, yet it is inappropriate for many customers, so the vendormay not see immediate payback from the large investment.andM;Quinn pointed out several reasons why publishers may not want to follow theCALS model for information exchange.andP;  They relate to the standards that wereselected, which:andM;* Presently accommodate only technical manuals; they are not appropriate tomany documents, such as newspapers, magazines, newsletters and otherunstructured literature;andM;* Were established for a fairly well-defined flow of information;andM;* Are premised on the knowledge of what the information is used for.andM;To a large extent, the limitations of the CALS standards are an inevitablebyproduct of the CALS process, since CALS was never intended to specify apaper-publishing methodology.andP;  As Quinn pointed out, CALS was implemented bythe government as an information management philosophy intended to &quot;managethe interface between diverse applications in a heterogeneous environment....andO;The DoD recognizes that publishing is not a product, but a logistic process(environment) that needs to be managed to provide the necessary informationto the end user exactly when it is needed.&quot;andM;In addition to the limitation of document types, it will be difficult totranslate this into some segments of the commercial world where publishing isviewed as a product, not a process.andP;  Nevertheless, as earlier speakers noted,the new tools provided with electronically delivered documents will createnew possiblities for consumers.andP;  We see CALS further spurring demand forreceiving information in electronic form.andM;Frank Gilbane countered Quinn's points with the assertion that the impetus ofthe CALS initiative is common across all segments of the publishing industry.andO;Publishing and information management are converging, and users will have todecide what will be the medium of information exchange.andP;  The push toward CALSmay be so strong that its model will likely predominate in the government andtech-doc sectors.andP;  But others will be equally valid, if not equallyrepresented in the market, and industries and large users may end updeveloping their own models (ODA, Digital's CDA, IBM's MODCA, and NorthernTelecom's home-grown system, for example).andM;Gilbane's parting advice to &quot;stay abreast technologically andorganizationally, and take a close look at the CALS model and try to map yourcompany's information management needs to it&quot; may sound unpleasant, but thechoice may be between voluntary examination now and forced compliance in thefuture.andM;Customizing your own systemandM;In the New Technologies Seminar earlier in the week, Jean-Louis Gassee, DaveLiddle and others asserted that in the future users will have to takeincreased responsibility for customizing their own systems.andP;  Gassee andLiddle were making this point as a response to a trend they saw towardend-user programming.andP;  Not coincidentally, both men's companies arepioneering object-oriented and/or hypertext-style programming tools that theyargue will attract people to programming who have the application knowledgeto add real value to application programs.andM;On the other hand, many users are accepting the responsibility forcustomizing their own systems today--largely without the benefit of thenext-generation end-user programming tools.andP;  (We did see two innovativeapplications where the users employed hypertext systems to build their ownmultimedia publishing applications--see Publishing Without Paper.)andM;Rolling your own.andP;  Nowhere was this phenomenon more apparent than in the LongDocument User Experiences sessions.andP;  Virtually every speaker depicted asituation where each was forced to piece together a &quot;total&quot; solution from anumber of building blocks--some of which are positioned as &quot;total publishing&quot;solutions in their own right.andP;  In these cases vendors were used as suppliersonly; the users did all the integration themselves.andP;  Moreover, severalspeakers went beyond the role of the integrator of off-the-shelf componentsto tailor their systems to their own requirements, using custom programmingwhere no standard product sufficed.andP;  Here are a few case studies.andM;Beyond system integration.andP;  At last year's Seminars, Steve Kotrch, who is thedirector of graphics (and chief system architect) for Value Line in New York,provided us with a fascinating account of how he helped to assemble ValueLine's editorial and production system, which consists of a Tandem computerholding the financial data, a network of PCs running XyWrite for theanalysts, a Xyvision system used to do the page makeup and dataextraction/graphing software running on a Sun workstation (see Vol.andP;  17, No.andO;16).andM;This year Kotrch brought us up to date on his latest efforts to make theValue Line system more productive.andP;  Arguing that there is in reality a gapbetween productivity and features in most software applications sold today,Kotrch targeted his efforts at making applications easier to use for thosepeople who are essential to Value Line's operation.andM;Kotrch was faced with a difficult task.andP;  XyWrite is the major tool that hisanalysts use to write their reports, yet as we all know XyWrite is not a textprocessor for the faint of heart.andP;  Moreover, analysts have to leave XyWriteperiodically to extract data from the Tandem mainframe and to performfinancial analyses using Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  It was taking too long to bringanalysts up to speed on the intricacies of XyWrite and Lotus, a task nothelped by the lack of a common user interface between the two programs (or,for that matter, between any of the applications being used).andM;Kotrch quickly decided that &quot;a good user interface is the key to bothacceptance and efficient use&quot; of the publishing system.andP;  As Kotrch pointedout, the &quot;goal is to allow editors and writers to concentrate on productrather than process.&quot;andP;  To accomplish this, the user interface implementedshould &quot;use the publisher's terms for things rather than its own technicaljargon, and provide functions that take care of tedious details--formattingtext, system chores--making complicated procedures transparent, thereforemore accurate.&quot;andM;None of the existing off-the-shelf user interfaces (Macintosh, Windows) wasfeasible, given the combination of tools being applied.andP;  Consequently Kotrchand his staff designed their own.andP;  The resulting user interface substituted asimplified, flat menu system in place of XyWrite's multilayered help system.andO;Kotrch exercised a few simple guidelines when designing his UI:andM;* Organize the menus to include commonly used functions like search andreplaceandM;* Avoid overcrowding (use only 7 to items in your menu)andM;* Eschew obfuscation (e.g., use the word &quot;select&quot; rather than &quot;define&quot; if theformer is conceptually more obvious to the user)andM;* Create short cuts (e.g., Ctrl-B for bold)andM;* Make the dangerous difficult (e.g., erase file)andM;* Make the tedious transparent.andM;There is also a menu that appears when no file is open that presents aschematic of a typical page and presents all the choices a writer has indiagrammatic form (see Figure 1).andM;Kotrch enumerated the benefits of customizing your own user interface as:andM;* Significantly reduce the training and support costs;andM;* Enhance acceptance among users;andM;* Increase their accuracy and speed, particularly with regard to tedious,repetitive tasks; andandM;* Make it easier to manage freelance work.andM;It is interesting to consider whether Value Line would have required the sameintegrating effort if all the applications it was using ran in a commonenvironment, such as X Window, Presentation Manager, or the Mac.andP;  Although itmight have made the job easier, Kotrch would argue that this wouldn't be goodenough--that for maximum productivity he would want a user interfacecustomized to his own unique requirements, although he would likely build ontop of an existing unifying environment, were one available.andM;It is perhaps worthwhile to keep Value Line's model in mind as we attempt toput the current user interface wars in perspective.andM;Designing from the ground up.andP;  Linda Lorber, a senior training analyst withMcDonnell Douglas, is involved in a project to design and implement amultivendor publishing system that is out of this world--literally.andP;  As partof the team (composed of Boeing, McDonnell-Douglas, and ORI) responsible forproviding the Technical and Management Information System (TMIS) to supportthe Space Station Freedom's information needs, Lorber has responsibility forthe design, development and implementation of training for allInterleaf-related courses in the project.andM;Interleaf is only one part of the equation, however.andP;  The TMIS architectureincludes a three-tier conceptual design (see illustration on facing page)that includes library services, organization databases, electronic mail,shared storage, printing and scanning, text processing, advanced documentcomposition, and graphics.andP;  The components of TMIS are Interleaf running onApollo workstations, DisplayWrite 4 on PC-compatible workstations, and anElectronic Document Control Subsystem (EDCS) running on a Vax along withBRS/Search, a full-text document search subsystem.andM;Lorber's team's job is to get users operational on the system once it hasbeen installed.andP;  As she points out, &quot;you can't just ship boxes to users andexpect them to use it.&quot;andP;  Not only did a rational and equitable distributionplan have to be worked out (including determining who gets the big boxes,with Interleaf, and who gets the little boxes running DisplayWrite 4), but aninstallation, training and support strategy also had to be put into place.andO;The system also had to be integrated with NASA's existing information system(which dictated the selection of DisplayWrite 4, among other things), and hadto be capable of supporting the project for the 30-year duration of thesystem and data!andM;Lorber indicated that the team got &quot;little support&quot; from the individualvendors from whom each component was purchased.andP;  This was inevitable giventhat each component was only marginally useful without the integration withthe other components, yet few vendors are willing or able to addressintegration problems on this scale.andP;  (Note to vendors and entrepreneurs:enterprise-wide integration services that extend beyond your own subsystemcould prove to be a lucrative business opportunity.)andP;  Essentially, an entirecustom support infrastructure had to be created largely from scratch tosupport the TMIS undertaking.andP;  On-site support teams had to be assembled foreach of the regional sites, software gurus found, telephone supportestablished, and basic and advanced training made available on a continuingbasis.andM;These steps were considered essential because without appropriate trainingand support users weren't likely to use the system.andP;  As Lorber summarized,&quot;As a manufacturer, buyer, or integrator, your job is not over once thehardware/software is sold, shipped, and installed.andP;  It's only over when theusers are using the system for their daily tasks and are themselves thinkingof innovative ways to use the system to perform new tasks.&quot;andM;Other case studiesandM;The user presentations provided other examples of end users takingresponsibility for building and customizing their own solutions.andM;Tom Deakins, of Cincinnati Bell Information Systems, discussed how hiscompany was applying publishing technologies and solutions to traditional MISapplications, such as using graphics and scanning subsystems to digitallyrecord checks in a bank, or printing ads on telephone bills for Ma Bell.andO;Deakins pointed out that &quot;no single strategy addresses all issues,&quot; and thatconsequently his organization is forced to constantly innovate to findappropriate solutions for what is essentially an entirely new category ofbusiness opportunities.andM;Jesse Berst, of New Riders Publishing, had a different problem.andP;  As a bookpublisher using Ventura Publisher to produce a number of books (about VenturePublisher, among other titles), New Riders desperately needed the type ofproduction management and tracking tools that the &quot;big boys&quot; provide, but ontheir desktop budget.andP;  Since nothing was available at the time, they inventedtheir own document/project management utility for Ventura which they havesubsequently decided to market to others as Desktop Manager, a Venturaadd-on.andM;Richard Healy of Digitron Ltd. in Cape Town, South Africa, helped to assemblea demand-printing service bureau, pairing Ventura Publisher, PageMaker andMultimate with Xerox 9790/8790/4050, IBM and Siemens high-end laser printers.andO;Lacking a model for such a configuration, Digitron was forced to use itscontacts with the Xerox user's group, Xplor, subscriptions to internationalmagazines, and other &quot;grass-roots&quot; sources to find the conversion softwarenecessary to mate the desktop programs with the high-end printers.andP;  (Needlessto say, Xerox, IBM and Siemens didn't anticipate such an arrangement, andcould provide little help in the  situation.)andM;Carol Buchanan of Boeing Computer Services provided us with an update ontheir ongoing development of their own Automated Laser Publishing System,which combines off-the-shelf applications with custom programming necessaryto be able to capture screen shots of software under development and havethem be automatically imported into documentation under development (see Vol.andO;17, No.andP;  16 for a description of this project).andM;What became clear from these and other presentations is that users areincreasingly being forced to (or voluntarily electing to) take responsibilityfor integrating and customizing their systems.andP;  What isn't clear--at leastfrom these accounts--is where people turn for help when they strike out ontheir own.andM;Getting helpandM;The major problem with &quot;rolling your own,&quot; of course, is that there are fewplaces a user can turn to get help.andP;  Although system vendors and VARs existthat can help you assemble the major building blocks, few outsideorganizations are in a position to help you tailor your system to your ownneeds.andP;  At the bull session Thursday evening this latter issue dominated thediscussion, with many people asking &quot;Is the user the only person who can dothis?&quot; and &quot;Where do we go to get help?&quot;andP;  The best advice, aside fromensuring that you have your own inhouse integration staff, was to join usergroups, obtaining advice and support at the &quot;grass-roots&quot; level.andM;Is this an effective model for how systems are built in the Fourth Wave?andP;  Aswas also clear from the discussions, many publishers have (finally, and manyvendors would claim belatedly) recognized the hard-dollar value of goodservice and support.andP;  In the newspaper market the question is whether thevendors who traditionally provided such support will stay in business longenough to make the transition to Fourth Wave marketing and servicestrategies.andM;Among long document publishers, however, there has never been a single vendorcapable of taking responsibility for the entire enterprise-wide informationmanagement activity.andP;  When examining the roles of the various &quot;subsystem&quot;suppliers in the preceding chronicles it isn't evident that they were remissin their responsibilities.andP;  An Interleaf or Xyvision or XyQuest cannotpretend to take responsibility for the whole shebang because their effortsare still largely focused on the publishing function, whereas most corporateentities now recognize that publishing is but one part of the overallmanagement information workflow.andM;Although there may be an opportunity for vendors such as IBM or DEC to playthe role of the &quot;super-integrator,&quot; the nature of our heterogeneous computingenvironments makes it unlikely that long-document publishers will find theanswers to their integration and customizing needs anywhere but amongthemselves.andM;CALS ExhibitsandM;The Seminars were not the CALS haven that now characterizes the annualTechDoc event, but many of the publishing vendors committed to CALS showcasedtheir progress toward compliance with the DoD initiative.andP;  Only Datalogicsclaims to have a CALS-ready package that is finished, but Compugraphic,Interleaf and Context showed software that is about ready for testing in thefield.andP;  CG and Interleaf are targeting June for commercial delivery; Contextsays by the end of 1989.andP;  Intergraph is still ironing out the details of itsimplementations of the CALS DTDs, but it hopes to have its offeringcommercially available by year-end as well.andM;In each of those cases, the vendor is putting together an end-to-endsolution--that is, one that supports CALS from the creation and editing ofdocuments through to delivery in magnetic tape, the current CALSspecification.andP;  Only Xyvision, which was at TechDoc but not the Seminars, hasno current plan for an editorial component.andP;  Interestingly, the vendors thatdo not recognize SGML as part of their database (Interleaf and Context) areconsidering the use of Software Exoterica's XGML engine, which would provideon-the-fly parsing and validation.andM;Such an approach would be in step with the overall goal of CALS, which istransparent document interchange at all stages of the weapons development,acquisition and maintenance cycles.andP;  Those vendors that recognize SGML withinthe publishing program (Compugraphic and Intergraph) have had this philosophyall along.andM;Watching grass grow.andP;  Real demonstrations of how interchange will happen inthe CALS initiative are not really practical as yet.andP;  One reason for this isthe current lack of an output specification.andP;  Without such a spec, therecipient of an 1840A tape does not have enough guidelines (without seeingthe original document in printed form) to faithfully reproduce the document'sappearance, and does not necessarily know in advance how to format some ofthe document's components.andP;  Thus, the interchange process, which entailsvalidating the incoming file, creating an output specification that matchesthe document-type definition and finally recreating the document on yourpublishing system, may take hours, even days on long documents--obviously toolong for a show demo.andP;  As Kevin Cavanaugh of Xyvision remarked, &quot;a demo ofCALS is like watching grass grow.&quot;andM;A second reason is that vendors are just now finishing their software, andtests have been few.andP;  To date, most companies are experimenting with samplecomposite documents.andP;  To our knowledge, McDonnell-Douglas (using Xyvision'ssystem) is the first contractor delivering weapons system documentation (someparts of the F-14E) on 1840A tapes as well as paper.andM;Nevertheless, the tone of conversations about CALS has changed for everyoneinvolved, from tentative endorsements and projections for compliance toreports on the status of information exchange.andP;  We expect that by next yearthe majority of the CALS vendors will be able to talk about interchange ofmanuals between customers and the armed services.andM;Avalanche DevelopmentandM;The CALS initiative has brought prominence to several companies that havedeveloped little-known products that are suddenly in great demand.andP;  Avalancheis such a company.andP;  Its Imsys.CALS, based on its Visual Recognition Engine,which interprets visual cues in the output file of word processors andgenerates a tagged ASCII file, is viewed as one of the few tools around forautomatically &quot;retrofitting&quot; text files into SGML for incorporation into aCALS-compliant publishing system.andP;  Since mil-spec documents conform torigorous format requirements, the accuracy of Avalanche's product is quitehigh for this application.andM;At the Seminars, Avalanche was in two booths: those of Apollo andCompugraphic.andP;  In the Apollo area, Avalanche demonstrated the successfulporting of Imsys.CALS to Apollo workstations, adding to the PC and Sunplatforms that are currently available.andP;  (The PC version is cooperativelymarketed by Context.)andP;  In Compugraphic's booth, the two companies jointlyannounced that CG will be selling a version of Imsys.CALS specificallytailored to CAPS (see Compugraphic below).andM;Imsys.CALS reads print files from Microsoft Word, WordPerfect or other wordprocessors with Epson, Diablo or IBM Proprinter drivers.andP;  All versions aresold for a suggested list price of $9,500 through value-added resellers.andM;Although it was not shown, Avalanche said that a Mac version of Imsys.CALS isnearly ready to release.andM;CompugraphicandM;CALS has been a blessing for Compugraphic, because it is the application thatthe Texet software (now Compugraphic CAPS) was designed for: rigidlystructured documents.andP;  Texet was the first vendor to build a text-and-graphiccomposition system that used an object-based database.andP;  As a result, thesoftware enables the user to manipulate logical structures of the documentwhile still keeping the underlying generic tagging intact.andM;To fully utilize the system's unique capabilities, Compugraphic isintegrating an SGML editor into CAPS.andP;  It has abandoned Texet's LiveWrite(shown at last year's Seminars) in favor of SoftQuad's Author/Editor, whichhas the advantage of being already complete for a less expensive workstation(a Mac instead of a Sun).andM;Under an agreement between the two companies, Compugraphic plans to offer aversion of Author/Editor that will be integrated with CAPS.andP;  Initially, CAPSAuthor/Editor will  essentially be the standard SoftQuad product under theAgfa Compugraphic label, but the two companies are working together tofurther develop the product.andM;CG is now taking orders for CAPS Author/Editor based on the Mac, withshipments scheduled to start within 30 to 60 days.andP;  The price is $495; theCALS version is $995.andM;However, CG announced that SoftQuad also will be developing a Sun version ofthe CAPS Author/Editor that should be available during the third quarter of1989.andM;Compugraphic announced that it will also work with Avalanche to developconversion software, based on the Avalanche Visual Recognition Engine, thatis specifically tailored to CAPS.andP;  A prototype was shown running on a PC,taking WordPerfect files and generating markup from a CAPS document typedefinition (DTD).andP;  One key advantage to the CAPS version is that it willgenerate markup that will capitalize on some of the features of CAPS.andP;  Forexample, in the demonstration, the numbers in numbered lists were replacedwith CAPS flags that, after the file was imported, resulted in automaticallynumbered lists in CAPS.andP;  This is an excellent example of how vendors can addextra value within the framework CALS provides.andP;  Because CAPS understandsstructure within the document, the conversion software enables the user to domore than simply accept an SGML file: it can convert into CAPS, whichautomatically numbers based on the structure of the document, withoutviolating the SGML conventions.andM;This product will be available in the third quarter of 1989.andP;  Pricing for acomplete toolkit, including some specific filters, is likely to be at least$6,000.andM;Stage I and II of CAPS.andP;  Compugraphic announced at Tech-Doc that it istargeting June for delivery of the first stage of its CALS-compliantsoftware.andP;  This software will enable its customers to accept an 1840A tape,add SGML files, merge IGES or CCITT graphics files and produce another 1840Atape.andP;  At present, the Sobemap batch parser is being used to validateconformance.andM;What Compugraphic has yet to do is develop a CAPS DTD that conforms to 28001,the CALS specification.andP;  It plans to build in enforcement of the DID withinCAPS (via an interactive parser), thereby virtually eliminating the chancesof producing a nonconforming document.andP;  These additions, as well as a thirdaspect, support for the new output specification, are to be included in thesecond stage of its software, which should be finished by early 1990.andM;Life outside of CALS?andP;  Outside of CALS, Compugraphic is still wrestling withthe problem of exception pages, the Achilles heel of CAPS.andP;  It has droppedthe FreePage software developed by Island Graphics and is pursuing atwo-pronged approach.andP;  First, it has added flexibility to CAPS.andP;  The CAPS 2.0software released last year added support for certain types of exceptionpages, such as side-turns.andP;  The &quot;excerpt&quot; element has been extended toinclude variable excerpts that extract information into a new object.andP;  And inpagination, you can now assign a penalty value to nonbreaking objects, sothat under certain conditions they may be broken over two or more pages.andM;Second, it continues to offer Frame/Maker as a third-party product fordealing with unstructured documents, an alternative that appears feasible inlight of Frame's new 2.0 release.andP;  FrameMaker is in no way integrated withCAPS, which makes it appear to be an interim solution, although CG is atpresent unsure what level of integration its customers will expect.andP;  It maybe another year or more until this aspect of CAPS falls into place.andM;Those issues aside, Compugraphic is actively pursuing accounts in thefinancial, automotive and manufacturing markets.andP;  It views CAPS as an&quot;assimilative composition engine&quot; that will accept information from a varietyof sources and prepare final output.andM;In the long run, CG sees document management (to be addressed in futurereleases) and its end-to-end approach as keys to its success.andP;  The companyplans to move its software under a standard windowing environment by nextyear, which it hopes will make it even easier to use.andM;ContextandM;The year 1988 was good for Context.andP;  Its sales rose from $11 million in 1987to $20 million last year, and its profits showed consistent growth as well.andO;Context has succeeded by targeting specific industries that have longdocumentation cycles.andP;  Commercial airlines, military and aerospacecontractors, CASE, pharmaceutical, navigation, trucking, legal and automateddesign are its primary markets.andM;This year's booth showed the maturity of its system: rather than introduce abevy of new features, the company highlighted modest enhancements that retainits strong position in the documentation market.andM;Graphics.andP;  The biggest change Context has made to its graphics functions isthe addition of inclusion by reference into PicEd.andP;  Previously, only theContext page composition editor included graphics by reference.andP;  WithinPicEd, the graphics editor, graphics were imported before you could modifythem or add other layers, such as annotations.andP;  Now you can include a graphicby reference within PicEd, so that additional layers may be added withoutmodifying the source file.andP;  The reference to the PicEd graphic from the pageeditor calls both the source graphic and whatever layers were added by thegraphics editor.andM;The one limitation is that different versions of graphics are still savedmanually, without the Change Control feature that is part of the page editor.andM;Page editor.andP;  Context showed its current software release, 6.0, which waspreviewed at last year's Seminars (see Vol.andP;  17, No.andP;  15, p.7).andP;  It is nowmaking use of Avalanchehs Imsys.CALS and the Sobemap parser for receivingASCII files.andP;  It also uses the Sobemap parser at output to verify that thefile conforms to the DTD specified.andP;  Within the document, SGML coding may beturned on or off.andP;  New components that have SGML coding are entered throughmacros--Context has yet to implement SGML structures within the menus thatare used by those first learning the system.andP;  Errors during parsing arereported in the status window outside of the page display.andM;One aspect Context has yet to implement is on-the-fly parsing within theeditor itself.andP;  Given its role as an authoring tool, we believe this addeddegree of security is highly desirable.andP;  It is true that the structurednature of the system makes mistakes less likely, but it is still possible tocreate nonconforming documents and to introduce errors into an alreadyconforming document.andM;Futures.andP;  The company's ties to Mentor Graphics should continue to have apositive impact.andP;  Mentor is aggressively pursuing CALS compliance across allof its products, and there is rumor that it may add another platform for itssystems.andP;  Context indicated that it would follow Mentor's lead in porting toother platforms.andM;DatalogicsandM;Datalogics and DEC joined hands to demonstrate how Digital's DocumentInterchange Format (DDIF) can be used to exchange documents among differentpublishing applications.andP;  Digital showed DECwrite documents being sentthrough the DDIF converter to Datalogics, which brought up the file in itsPager publishing system.andM;CALS Subscription Service.andP;  This was our first chance to see the DatalogicsCALS Subscription Service, and it is hard to imagine a CALS publishing systemthat would be less intimidating.andP;  The underlying Datalogics software is verysophisticated and would ordinarily take considerable training and practice tolearn.andP;  But in its subscription package, Datalogics has set up everything forthe user, so that creating a CALS-compliant tape, whether it be from a sourcefile generated on another system or created within WriterStation, is a matterof a few, easily understood steps.andP;  The interface is typical of minicomputersor mainframes, but it is one that is simple and readily understood.andM;We are not surprised to see Interleaf following Datalogics' lead, and expectthat other vendors may offer similar streamlined versions that introduce newcustomers to CALS and electronic publishing in simplified form.andM;The latest revisions to WriterStation, which Datalogics had hoped to bring tothe Seminar, were not quite ready to bring along.andP;  We will report on newfeatures of Pager and WriterStation at the next opportunity.andM;IntergraphandM;Of the CALS vendors at the Seminars, Intergraph was the last to enter thefray, but it has potential to be one of the more promising systems whenfinished.andP;  First, the architecture of Intergraph's DP Publisher is based onIGML-compliant at all times.andP;  The structure of DP/Publisher also makesimplementation of different DTDs a simple task from the user's perspective.andO;Further, DP/Publisher is linked to Intergraph's DP/Manager, a relationaldatabase manager through which any application on the Intergraph net may bemonitored and manipulated.andP;  Finally, Intergraph as a platform vendor isdeveloping hardware and system software that will mesh with its applicationsoftware.andP;  One example is the inclusion of built-in CD-ROM drives with allnew file servers to enable the company to deliver its software anddocumentation on CD-ROM.andP;  Its practical experience in this application willbe useful as a carry-over into the CALS development.andM;DP/Publisher 2.0.andP;  Intergraph showed the second release of DP/Publisher,which is scheduled to be shipped to customers by the end of this month.andP;  Itis a substantial upgrade to the product that addresses many shortcomings ofthe first release and adds a few new significant features:andM;* Annotations.andP;  Notes may be added to an overlay that is not part of thesource document.andP;  Annotations may be printing or nonprinting, temporary orpermanent, and may contain graphics as well as text--a feature that is rareeven among tech-doc systems.andM;* Revision control.andP;  Changes are tracked to individual users as well asacross different versions of a document, with change bars automaticallyinserted.andP;  The style of different users' edits is customizable to allow foreasy differentiation, and they may be specified differently by differentusers to accommodate individual preferences.andP;  You can specify which edits(according to user) you see when working on a document.andM;* Math.andP;  DP/Publisher now handles both inline and display math setting, andit apears to be nearly as easy to use as that of FrameMaker and ArborText.andM;* Tables.andP;  The interactive table editor is much improved with the addition ofrecognition of cells and columns.andP;  Individual or groups of cells may beselected and manipulated.andP;  Page break parameters may be restricted forselected cells to produce more aesthetic results.andP;  Dynamic sizing of cells isunder development, but is not included in this release.andM;* Inclusion by reference.andP;  Graphics not created within DP/Publisher may beincorporated without actually importing them through theinclusion-by-reference feature.andP;  It supports graphics in IGDS (Integraphvector), InterScript (DP/Presenter), TIFF and CCITT Group IV formats.andP;  IGESand CGM files are included as well, although they pass through filters on theway.andM;* Pagination.andP;  Looseleaf pagination is now fully supported for Mil-Specapplications.andP;  Pagination may be restricted to only the affected area, whichmay be as small as an individual component.andM;Working within CALS.andP;  Because of DP/Publisher's architecture, the system iswell-suited to editorial and production environments that need to conform tothe CALS initiative.andP;  The system stores content and form completelyseparately.andP;  In content, the system uses a subset of SGML (which it callsIGML) to tag and describe the structure of the document.andP;  Formats fordocument components are kept in a Styles folder.andP;  Styles may be applied toany document at will.andP;  In a CALS setting, an additional folder keepspredefined DTDs.andP;  These are applied to the content following the SGML filter(for incoming ASCII files) as part of the parsing and validation process ofverifying that a document complies with the CALS standards.andP;  Once withinDP/Publisher, the DTD syntax is stored with the content of the document andused to prevent users from making modifications that violate the DTD.andO;Because style is kept separate from content, users can still format thedocument in a variety of ways without violating its SGML conformance.andP;  Thisis important, because in nearly every other system, the process of producinga CALS tape produces a second source file.andP;  In DP/Publisher, the same sourcefile may be used for both hard copy and electronic distribution.andM;Intergraph says it has the CCITT filter ready, but it is still working onmaking its IGES and CGM filters conform to the CALS spec and incorporatingthe DTDs.andP;  It plans to offer CALS compliance as a commercial product by theend of 1989.andM;DP Manager.andP;  The database application was shown as it will look in its firstrelease, which should be available by the end of this month.andP;  There aren'tmany changes from when we last viewed the product (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  4, p.andO;21), except that it is now much more refined.andM;One of the unique features of the DP/Manager-DP/Publisher combination is theability to define a work flow for automatic copy routing.andP;  It is evenpossible to restrict change control according to the location of the job inthe flow, so that one class of users is able to make certain modifications atone stage but is no longer given permission to make such changes later on inthe production cycle (when others would have such authority).andP;  This is themost sophisticated change-control we've yet seen, yet the interface forsetting it up and maintaining it is quite easily understood.andM;Building a database interface.andP;  Right now, DP/Publisher works with Informixas the underlying database software.andP;  But DP/Manager is actually a databasemanager that acts upon an underlying relational database.andP;  Because of the wayit was constructed, Intergraph will be able to use the same software tointerface to other databases.andP;  In the future, it plans to offer DP/Manager asa relational interface system that works with Oracle and Ingres as well asInformix.andP;  This means that customers will be able to blend DP/Manager withexisting (as well as new) databases they have running under Unix or VMS,regardless of which application software they use.andP;  It is an approach thatcombines the system-level tools of the platform with the application-specifictools of the individual software vendors, and it gives DP/Manager muchbroader appeal, as well as considerable food for thought for other platformvendors.andM;InterleafandM;The bulk of Interleaf's new technologies fell outside the realm of CALSspecifically, and so they were covered above.andP;  But it is worth noting thatall of its hypertext and optical publishing capabilities will mesh well withCALS compliance in the future.andP;   Once weapons contractors are able to deliverdocumentation electronically, the armed services will need better ways ofretrieving and viewing the documentation.andP;  Thus far, the CALS committee hasmade no effort to standardize this aspect, and it may never have to.andP;  As longas its publishing system is able to recognize the information that is storedin standard form, it may make sense to make use of the natural competitiveforces in the market to get the retrieval/viewing software best suited to theapplication at hand.andP;  What may be lost without  standardization would beadditional information that is vendor-specific, such as Interleaf's hypertextlinks.andP;  If such links are added to the DTD in the form of specificstructures, Interleaf's method of passing the links through as ASCII commentspossibly could be modified to meet such a spec.andM;In short, we think Interleaf is ahead of much of the crowd in developingsoftware for what promises to be a future path not only for CALS but forother areas of documentation that follow the model CALS is offering theentire publishing industry.andM;Futures aside, Interleaf's CALS Preparedness Package has been put up on theCALS Text Network and is slated for demonstration at the NCGA show later thismonth.andP;  We will report on its progress as the saga continues.andM;Database Publishing ExhibitsandM;CliMacsandM;CliMacs, a Swedish company, brought HyperPublisher, a new database publishingpackage for the Mac.andP;  Though it is not finished yet, it is complete enough togive an impression of what the final product will be like.andP;  It was shown atthe Seminars to solicit early feedback and to line up potential OEM partners(CliMacs probably won't sell HyperPublisher directly in the U.S.).andM;HyperPublisher has the features normally associated with a database product,and the initial setup is what you expect with a database.andP;  You get to specifya series of field names and to indicate which ones are to be indexed.andP;  Fieldscan be of various types.andM;In addition to the usual numeric and text fields, HyperPublisher supportsimage data and &quot;DTP text&quot;--arbitrarily long text fields which may includefont and size changes.andP;  HyperPublisher isn't just a database, of course.andP;  Itis also a full-featured desktop publishing package.andP;  When completed, it willhave general-purpose features for placing text and graphics and for composingtext in a manner similar to other Mac DTP packages.andP;  When used just as a DTPpackage, though, the fact that it also has database features is notexploited.andM;The real power of the package is manifested when the database capability andthe DTP capability are combined.andP;  This happens when you tell HyperPublisherto start assembling pages from items stored in its database.andP;  As an example,you might have a database of biographical entries.andP;  You could tellHyperPublisher on what basis to select and sort entries, which fields youwanted and in what order, and how to format the selected material.andP;  Theresult could be a directory-type product: an employee phone book, a &quot;Who'sWho&quot; of a particular industry, or a biographical dictionary.andP;  The package canhandle pictures too: given a suitable database of pictures and descriptivematerial, HyperPublisher could produce parts catalogs, product catalogs, orreal-estate listings.andP;  (CliMacs is a major distributor of Mac software inSweden.andP;  It developed HyperPublisher initially for its own catalog-productionneeds.)andM;Though HyperPublisher is oriented toward high-volume automatic operation, theuser interface is still largely visual (in keeping with the Macintosh style).andO;Layout parameters, for example, are represented visually as much as possible,and you can give many kinds of layout instructions without having to typecodes.andP;  Many parameters are also simple menu choices.andP;  On the other hand,some things are easiest to specify via the keyboard.andP;  HyperPublisher allowscontrol of most parameters via type-in dialogue boxes.andP;  For highly customizedapplications, you can also invoke an underlying database programming languagewith built-in debugger.andM;In HyperPublisher, you prepare layouts which are then associated with entriesfrom the database.andP;  These layouts can occupy a small fraction of a page.andO;(For classified ads, for  example, a single layout might get used repeatedlyfor every ad on the page.)andP;  Layouts are composed of boxes.andP;  A simple layoutfor a catalog might involve three boxes: the top one to contain the productname, the middle one to contain a product photo, and the bottom one a productdescription.andP;  When you create the layout, you specify what database field (orfields) should go into the box, whether the box can grow vertically orlaterally depending on its contents, and (for images) what happens if theimage is not correctly cropped for the box.andP;  The layout of an ad can bestored in the record for the ad itself, or a few standard layouts can be usedby large numbers of ads.andP;  A separate style sheet tells what typographicattributes each field should have.andM;HyperPublisher will lay out pages the best it can given the data, thelayouts, and a set of rules about permissible breakpoints between columns andpages.andP;  Vertical justification can be used to make short columns fit.andP;  Outputis to any PostScript device.andM;One unusual and helpful feature of HyperPublisher is that anything created byHyperPublisher can be stored in a HyperPublisher record.andP;  This means, forexample, that you could have a database of classified ads, and from it youcould create a database of pages composed of those ads.andP;  Or, data from pagingcan be fed back into the same database: in the record for each ad, you couldstore the page number on which it was placed, the vertical and horizontalposition it ended up in, and its composed depth.andP;  This might be valuable forbilling or for generating an index to the ads.andP;  (This kind of feedback isvery hard to achieve when the database and the pagination software are twodifferent packages.)andM;A number of features weren't working, or weren't in final form, at theSeminar.andP;  These included such basic functions as hyphenation andjustification (which CliMacs is considering licensing from another company),column-breaking logic, and tabular composition.andP;  These should be implementedduring the course of the coming months.andM;CliMacs has found interest in its product from publishers of variousproducts: catalogs, technical manuals, reference books and directories.andM;Pricing has not been set for HyperPublisher.andP;  The product should be releasedin the second half of 1989.andP;  CliMacs is currently looking for marketingpartners in the U.S.andP;  The company is also interested in selling itstechnology as an OEM component of other companies' products.andM;CliMacs AB, Linnegatan, 56, S-144 54 Stockholm, Sweden; phone 46 8 663 07 84.andM;OdestaandM;We recently reported on Odesta's ODMS software package in our report fromDexpo.andP;  The news at the Seminars had to do with the latest ODMS customer: theNew York Daily News.andP;  The paper will use ODMS as the &quot;backbone of anautomated page assembly system to manage the workflow and the documents thatare being generated toward the production of a daily newspaper.&quot;andP;  ODMS willrun on a Vax connected via an Ethernet LAN to a group of Macintoshes.andP;  We'llprovide more details as soon as they are available.andM;Picture Classified NetworkandM;Climacs was not the only new vendor with a database publishing package.andO;Picture Classified Network's Picture Plus+ also falls into that productcatagory, though it addresses a more specialized application.andP;  Picture Plus+is designed specifically for &quot;photo/ad periodicals,&quot; which means real estatelisting books, automotive and boat buyers guides, yellow pages, and similarproducts consisting entirely of ads and generally  distributed free.andM;Picture Classified publishes a series of auto buyers guides in thesoutheastern U.S., and it is looking to acquire additional guides in otherareas.andP;  It developed Picture Plus+ for its own needs, but is now interestedin selling it to others.andP;  The system is built around an IBM-compatible PCwith a video camera and frame-grabber board.andM;There are four basic operations in producing a guide using Picture Plus+.andP;  Ina production setting, they might each have a dedicated PC, but all can run ina single PC if the volume is small.andP;  The first operation is picture capture,which is done via the video camera.andP;  This produces a compressed RGB Targafile, which is stored in a database.andP;  Next comes data entry.andP;  Customer nameand address, billing information, and run dates are entered into thedatabase.andP;  (The system, though it does not use dBase, stores its files indBase-compatible format.andP;  That means the user can create reports usingdBase.)andP;  The third step is pagination, described below.andP;  Fourth is output,which can be to any PostScript device.andP;  (For decent halftones, ahigh-resolution machine is recommended!)andM;When ads are entered, they are given an &quot;ad type&quot; which indicates whatfraction of a page they will occupy and how the photo and type will bearranged.andP;  The typical periodical might have ten or twenty types.andP;  When thetime comes to produce an issue, all the active ads are sorted by category andplaced on pages according to their type.andP;  &quot;Custom&quot; ads (camera-ready ads thatdon't match one of the &quot;ad types&quot;) are placed interactively, and the otherads flow around them.andM;Another format supported is &quot;template ads,&quot; which are the same from week toweek except that certain areas within the ads change.andP;  For example, a cardealer might take out a page every week with the same layout, but theindividual photos and descriptions of cars within the ad would change eachtime.andM;Picture Plus+ has its own halftoning software.andP;  Although it uses PostScriptoutput devices, it does not use the PostScript halftone capability, butinstead sends bit-maps of the halftoned image to the device.andP;  The halftoningprocess takes from 2.5 to 4 minutes per video image on a 386-based PC.andM;Picture Classified Network's literature mentions a color-separation module,but we did not see any examples of this capability.andM;There is no pricing yet on Picture Plus+.andP;  It was brought to the Seminars totest market reaction.andP;  Picture Classified is looking for marketing channelsand is considering offering the system to service bureaus, which would thenhandle production for local periodicals.andM;Picture Classified Network, 506-C Edwardia Drive, Greensboro, NC 27409; phone(919) 299-2452.andM;Archetype/ECRMandM;ECRM and Archetype shared a booth at the Seminars.andP;  There, they showed a newArchetype-developed software package for managing high-resolution scanning.andO;It is called Archetype Network Agent.andP;  The package addresses the number-oneproblem involved in dealing with scanned high-resolution images on desktopcomputers: the large amounts of data they contain.andP;  This data, which runs tomany megabytes per image, can slow down application programs dramatically,and it can bring a network to a crawl when an image is transferred from onePC to another.andM;The Network Agent handles the data problem in a networked environment byproviding a low-resolution view file of each scanned image.andP;  One PC, equippedwith a powerful processor and lots of disk storage, acts as an image server.andO;The full-resolution image remains stored on this server PC, which isinterfaced directly to the scanner and the output imagesetter.andP;  Thelow-resolution view file, with only a few percent of the total data, iseasily transferred around the network.andP;  It can be used for sizing, cropping,and placement on the page.andM;How the image is treated at output time depends on comments that have beenembedded in the PostScript-format image file.andP;  There are two kinds ofcomments.andP;  At scanning time, a comment gets embedded in the view file whichtells the pathname of the full-resolution data file.andP;  The output softwareuses this to find the original data.andP;  During image placement andmanipulation, the application software must embed other comments which givescaling, cropping, and placement information.andP;  These are used to replicatethe same manipulations on the full-resolution data.andM;There are, of course, operations where the full image data must be available.andO;This is true for close masking, and for some fine retouching work.andP;  In thenetworked environment described above, these steps might best be performeddirectly at the image-server PC, so the image file doesn't need to travel.andM;At the show, the Network Agent was demonstrated using an ECRM scanner and twonetworked IBM-compatible 386-based PCs.andP;  A Novell network was used.andP;  Thedifference between moving a view file and moving full-resolution data in thisenvironment was dramatic.andP;  The full-resolution files for an 880K line-artimage and a 1.7-MB controne image (both monochrome) took 12-1/2 minutes tocross the network.andP;  The corresponding view files took 12 seconds.andM;Network Agent will be available around the end of June.andP;  Its price will beroughly $10,000.andM;Other Archetype news.andP;  Archetype Designer, version 2.1, is now being shipped.andO;This version incorporates a number of functionality improvements.andP;  Theyinclude an easier way of selecting objects on the screen (especially whenthey are closely grouped) and greatly improved input speed when importingtext.andM;In our review of Archetype last January, we didn't say much about colorfunctionality.andP;  Archetype Designer does support color, both spot andcontinuous-tone, in several ways.andP;  It can handle up to 32 &quot;layers&quot; perdocument.andP;  This could be 32 different spot colors or four process-colorlayers plus up to 28 spot colors.andP;  The screen appearance of each layer can beuser specified, and each layer can be viewed individually.andP;  If view files areavailable for preseparated color work, these can be used for placement andreplaced with full data on output.andP;  Spot colors can be output a layer at atime, for printing with different inks; or they can be specified aspercentages of process colors and be output with the four process-cololayers.andM;DocuProandM;In addition to announcing that it had been acquired by InformationInternational, which we reported in our last issue, DocuPro demonstrated somesignificant enhancements to its Professional Publishing Software, includingsupport for spot color, more flexible automatic placement of illustrationsand the beginning of revision control.andM;The spot color feature supports any number of color layers, selected from apalette of 256 colors.andP;  The operator can adjust colors on the screen usingslider bars, based either on RGB or CYMK models.andM;Placement of illustrations has been made much more flexible.andP;  Options nowavailable for floating illustrations include specifying that they float tothe top first, to the bottom first, only to the top, only to the bottom, tothe top as the first priority and then to the bottom either on the currentpage only or on the next page, to the bottom as the first priority on thecurrent of next page, to the top of the current page and then to the bottomof the next page, or to the bottom of the current page and then to the top ofthe next page.andP;  Illustrations also can be anchored to a particular page.andM;Text can be composed in irregular shapes by drawing a shape with a thread andflowing the text inside or outside of the shape.andM;New alignment features enable text, such as in labels associated with anillustration, to be aligned to other elements in a variety of ways, bothhorizontally and vertically.andP;  Text  consisting of multiple lines can bealigned based on the baseline of the top line of text or based on the bottomline of text.andM;As a first step toward a comprehensive revision control capability, DocuPronow supports automatic insertion of change bars.andP;  Different colors can beused to track changes made by different users.andP;  The bar, whose dimensions andlocation can be customized, takes its height from the number of lineschanged.andP;  DocuPro said that in a later release it would add the ability toshow what types of changes were made, rather than merely indicating thelocation of each change.andM;A new cross-referencing feature tracks numbered illustrations, tables, etc.,andO;within the current document or across multiple documents, which is done underthe &quot;book management&quot; capability.andP;  Documents can be linked for other purposesas well, such as accommodating numbering schemes.andM;Alignment features have been added to the tabular program to support hangingpunctuation in the margin of a tab column to align the figures or text.andP;  Italso enables hanging a dollar sign in the first entry of a column so that thenumbers below it will align properly.andM;Import filters have been added for MacWrite, Interleaf 3.5, FrameMaker andTIFF image formats.andM;Finally, DocuPro also announced that the monthly Consumer Reports has beenproduced since January using DocuPro software.andP;  The installation includes aSun-3/280 file server and three Sun-3/60 workstations.andP;  Text is input on aWang word processing system with codes embedded and sent via modem.andM;InterleafandM;Unlike its exhibit in previous Seminars, when Interleaf unveiled prototypesoftware, this year's exhibit showed how current Interleaf technology may beimplemented for various applications that publish without paper.andP;  Some ofwhat was shown is being made available to customers through Interleaf'sSystem Integration group, rather than being offered as a standard product.andO;One exception was Leafware, shareware that Interleaf is giving its customersas a taste of what is to come in TPS 5.0.andM;Programmable TPS.andP;  At last year's Seminar, Interleaf talked about how it wasincorporating a LISP-based programming language into TPS.andP;  At the time, thecompany said the language would be used to customize TPS for specificcustomer needs.andP;  This year, Interleaf will make LISP and Interleaf's LISPinterpreter available to TPS customers and software developers.andM;In general terms, the LISP extension language enables TPS users to extend thecapabilities of TPS by attaching LISP scripts to Interleaf desktop commands,menus and (eventually) icons.andP;  Interleaf will provide the LISP-based languagein several forms.andP;  The first, a run-time version with which simple desktopscripts can be written, will be distributed free to TPS users along with afew sample scripts.andP;  The full language will be made available later thisyear, with support offered to software developers interested in using thefacility to develop add-on products.andM;Before you shudder at the thought of programming in LISP, consider that theInterleaf desktop is an object-based environment.andP;  This means that therelationships of objects is understood by the system, and files anddirectories on the desktop may be manipulated as objects--what Interleafcalls &quot;event programming.&quot;andP;  Interleaf will provide the icon-andmenu-generating commands for you; all you have to do is tell it what eventwill take place.andP;  That event may or may not have been written in LISP.andM;Typical applications will be used to:andM;* Automate and simplify common publishing tasks, like file filters;andM;* Execute external programs from a pop-up menu within the TPS desktop, likecommunication programs to fetch files from a remote locationor database;andM;* Customize TPS, such as modifying the menus; andandM;* Integrate TPS more closely with nonpublishing applications written by othervendors, such as CASE or presentation graphics.andM;At the Seminar, Interleaf demonstrated the LISP extension language using whatit calls &quot;Leafware,&quot; desktop scripts written with the language.andP;  One examplewas a sort command.andP;  The actual LISP script was one line long--&quot;sort theselected children in ascending order.&quot; When loading the new script, thesystem adds the new function to the desktop popup menu (under &quot;Custom&quot;), sothat thereafter, the user simply activates a sort on selected objects throughthe popup menu.andM;Other Leafware scripts included mail merge, encrypting files, and otheruseful functions not normally available from the TPS desktop.andP;  Customerscould very likely add their own automatic filters from within Interleafmenus, to name but one possible application.andP;  With the full language, scriptsmay be as complex as an entire publishing sequence, such as one that opens adocument, runs a database, puts the output through a filter and inserts itinto a new document that is then moved to a new folder.andM;Interleaf used the language to develop its List of Effective Pages facilityfor looseleaf pagination.andP;  Any operating system command may be invoked.andM;Why LISP?andP;  Most publishing application software being written today(including Interleaf) is written in C.andP;  So why choose LISP as the extensionlanguage?andP;  Interleaf cites four reasons for its choice.andP;  LISP is:andM;* Interpreted, not compiled.andP;  This simplifies debugging because an interpetercan report the errors it finds.andM;* Object-oriented (with Interleaf's extensions).andP;  This means the user canmake use of desktop objects in the script (as in the sort example above).andM;* Easy for writing macros.andP;  Actually, LISP is no easier than other languages,and indeed is more cumbersome to learn than most.andP;  Nevertheless, with aninterpreter helping you to debug the routine, it shouldn't be too much harderthan programming in BASIC.andM;* Portable.andP;  LISP interpreters are available for all Interleaf platforms,which makes your scripts readily portable.andM;Interleaf hopes that in addition to offering the customer extensibility, theLISP extension language that will be part of the next release will also leadto the development of Interleaf add-on software products by other developers.andO;In the meantime, Interleaf is giving away a limited set of LISP programmingcapabilities in the current release, enough for users to create their ownLeafware.andP;  These user-written scripts will not be supported by Interleafitself (it is not practical to take repsonsibility for what users create witha language), but we suspect its user group meetings will quickly become ahotbed of Leafware exchange.andM;Fourth-wave undertown.andP;  Interleaf is the first of the Unix publishing vendorsto offer a way of extending its product.andP;  Quark and Bestinfo also offer suchcapabilities in their products for the Mac and PC, respectively.andP;  The trendis clear: in fourth-wave systems, the user will have the tools to customizeand extend the software without the vendor's direct assistance (althoughvendors are likely to offer such assistance for a fee).andP;  How easily thesystem may be extended will vary depending on the application, but at leastusers may take some comfort in knowing that, with some effort on their part,they may make modifications to the software they need without waiting for thevendor to do it for them.andM;RD Manager.andP;  Interleaf demonstrated the use of TPS 4.0 in a databasepublishing application that was done through its System Integration group.andO;Running on top of Oracle, the Relational Document Manager uses the Interleafdesktop to manage a library of objects that are retrieved from varioussources within the organization.andP;  The result is an object-oriented inventoryof the &quot;parts&quot; of a document.andP;  Document may be assembled from the inventorycontrol (TPS), which also tracks review and revision cycles via itseffectivity control.andM;The application shown was building display ads for a directory.andP;  Theaddresses are stored on a mainframe.andP;  The ad copy was created somewhere on aword processor.andP;  New art was digitized and stored in TPS.andP;  Logos are saved ina TPS graphics library.andP;  What Interleaf does is retrieve the appropriatepieces of the ad from their source, dump them into a TPS book and thenexecute a Leafware script to build the separate pieces into an ad that isformatted and scaled to the appropriate size (see photo).andM;TPS is not billed as a database publishing package, but Interleaf's democonveyed the message that its system integration group is actively working ondatabase publishing applications.andP;  The company also noted that RD Manager isused by some customers to manage documents, and Interleaf is consideringoffering a base-line RD Manager as a standard product.andM;KodakandM;Kodak introduced Advanced Publishing/Printing Software, a new modularapproach to KEEPS.andP;  See our coverage of Kodak under &quot;Color&quot; (p.andP;  13) fordetails.andM;Newport TechnologiesandM;One of the new products for the American market was the Textline systemdemonstrated by Newport Technologies International.andP;  It was developed inGermany by Compact Computer Systeme GmbHM which had introduced it in earlyform at Drupa in 1986.andP;  CCS has continued development since then, though, andhas installed the current software on about 120 workstations in Germany andSwitzerland.andP;  It runs on PCs networked via Novell Netware.andM;The version shown at the Seminars (and at Type-X three weeks later) has beenmodified for the American market.andP;  A few German expressions remained, butthese were being translated prior to initial U.S.andP;  shipments later thisspring.andM;Textline supports interactive layout of individual pages, as well as theability to flow text across multiple pages using master page designs andmanual placement of graphics.andP;  Text can be displayed in WYSIWYG format or asword bars, but all editing is done in a window that opens as needed anddisplays all text in the same size and font.andP;  Facing pages can be displayedsimultaneously.andP;  The screen can be zoomed as much as 2,000% of actual size.andM;The file management system appears to be capable, providing passwordsecurity, one directory for system files and other directories for users, aconvenient display of the  hierarchical system, etc.andM;The user interface is attractive, including nice, graphic facilities foraccessing the MS-DOS file management system; icons and cascading menus toselect functions and operations; a set of &quot;folders&quot; or &quot;cards&quot; that can bepulled up from the bottom of the screen to access parts of the program, suchas the editing window and font data; a status box to record the coordinateposition at the cursor location; a dialog box to set up tabular formats; andeasy means of specifying font widths and other system parameters.andM;Handamp;j.andP;  The justification routine targets the optimum interword space and thenworks toward the minimum before trying hyphenation and then insertion ofextra space toward the maximum.andP;   We didn't get a clear explanation of theintricacies of the program, but we were told that it places a penalty onhyphenating two consecutive lines, although it doesn't allow the operator tolimit the number of consecutive lines that may be hyphenated.andP;  This may be acarryover from the TEX roots of the program.andM;The user can specify the minimum size of word that can be hyphenated, thenumber of characters that must precede and follow a hyphen, and the language(from among U.S.andP;  and UK English, German, French and Italian).andP;  A small,updatable exception dictionary is supplied.andP;  The quality of hyphenation onsome of Newport's handout materials wasn't very good: Tex-tline, soft-tware,pu-blisher.andP;  We hope improvements will be made as the product is prepared forrelease.andM;Textline supports nice macro capabilities, enabling text and command codes tobe stored at four different levels:  system-wide, in a central library thatcan be accessed by multiple users, in a local library on a user's hard diskand within the current text file.andP;  Some macros are supplied with the system,including ones to generate dropped initial letters, create &quot;rubberband&quot; boxes(automatically sizing the box to accommodate a variable amount of text), andformatting tables.andM;Page composition.andP;  Page layout takes place in the &quot;Layout Workshop,&quot; which isentered by command.andP;  Text can be flowed into areas created interactively onpages based on master layouts, of which up to 26 can be used within anydocument.andP;  Master pages contain the usual information--running headers andfooters, folios, any fixed graphic elements, etc.andP;  Alignment tools include acrosshair cursor working in increments of one-tenth of a millimeter.andO;Measurements may be in inches, picas, points, millimeters, Didot points,ciceros, etc.andM;Information about any document (page size, date created, comments, etc.) isstored on a &quot;job card&quot; that can be accessed at any time.andM;Text flows into defined areas on a page according to a sequence specified bythe user.andP;  To flow text throughout a document, it is necessary to call upeach page sequentially, or it may be flowed through a sequence of commandswritten by the user within the program editor.andP;  Once text has been placed onpages, though, it automatically reflows throughout the document when changesare made.andM;During interactive layout, the operator can choose between a display ofWYSIWYG text and gray word bars representing text.andP;  The latter mode displaysconsiderably faster and also may be an aid to locating loose lines, althoughwithout seeing the text it is difficult to know how to fix the problem.andM;Vertical justification supports insertion of extra space between paragraphs,before and after heads based on relative percentages, and at other,user-specified locations, which can be given 10 relative values to cause moreor less space to be added.andM;During layout operations, rules and boxes can be drawn on the page.andP;  Boxescan be given round or square corners, fill patterns, tints, and colors,although a color monitor isn't supported.andP;  Up to eight layers can be createdto output on separate films.andM;At the Seminars, Newport was importing scanned graphics and placing them onpages.andP;  The company plans to provide full support for Astral's PicturePublisher gray-scale editor.andM;Handling text.andP;  Editing is initiated by selecting the &quot;editor&quot; card at thebottom of the screen and pulling it up to create an editing window ofvariable size.andP;  This reminds us of the Bestinfo editing function, except thatthe Textline screen display is much cleaner than Bestinfo's and the editingfeatures are better.andP;  (Don't forget, though, that Bestinfo also supportsexiting to WordWright for top-notch, XyWrite editing.)andP;  The Textline editorwas developed to emulate WordStar, so it provides a lot of functions but notthe smoothness of modern word processors.andP;  It enables marking the beginningand end of a block to move or copy it, but there are no single-key commandsfor defining a word, a paragraph, etc.andM;The keyboard can be customized.andM;Text in ASCII format can be imported.andP;  We asked about support for XyWrite andwere told that the matter is being addressed, but we don't have any details.andO;A routine is available for string-for-string conversion, which would preservethe font information in a XyWrite file.andM;Peripheral support is being added, including Kurzweil and Datacopy scanners,the Catchall text and image retrieval system developed in England and theAstral Picture Publisher gray-scale image editor.andM;Hardware, pricing and sales.andP;  Textline runs on a '286 or '386 with 640K, butextra memory is highly recommended.andP;  Newport had 2 MB of memory at theSeminars but said 5 MB would be advisable.andP;  Textline runs on a lot of graphicscreens--Sigma Designs, Cornerstone, Hercules, etc.--but it doesn't supportcolor.andP;  Novell Netware is the network choice.andM;Newport Technologies has the rights to sell Textline in North America.andP;  Saleswill be through direct offices (starting in New York and Washington) and adealer network, after it is set up.andP;  CCS, with 35 employees, sells theproduct in Germany and Switzerland, as does Monotype.andP;  CCS also handlesAustria.andM;The initial target market is typesetting service bureaus, large inplantoperations and small newspapers.andM;For the software alone, the price is $6,995 for one copy , or $12,800 forthree copies suitable for running on a network.andP;  Additional copies cost$2,665 for the fourth to sixth, $1,888 for the seventh through ninth, and$1,140 to the 12th.andP;  Drivers for Linotype, Monotype and Berthold typesetterscost extra.andM;How successful will Textline be?andP;  It appears to be a polished, professionalproduct with a nice blend of capabilities.andP;  But it starts with a couple ofdisadvantages.andP;  Traditionally, products developed outside the U.S.andP;  haven'tfared as well in the American market as their developers have thought theyshould, perhaps because they look different and operate differently andperhaps because customers are wary of being able to obtain good support for aproduct developed overseas.andP;  These obstacles can be overcome, and Newport andCCS are working to do that.andP;  Newport is committed to providing for U.S.andO;customers whatever features and support they need.andP;  We are impressed with thecompany's efforts so far.andM;The other concern is that this market is overcrowding very fast.andP;  On the onehand, PC composition programs from Magna and Bestinfo have been installed inhundreds of sites already, while other companies vying for their sharesabound: Linotype, Ultimate, G.O.andP;  Graphics, Cybertext, LaserMaker, and so on.andO;But perhaps even more important is the fact that pressure from beneath surelywill have an increasing impact on all of these vendors before long.andP;  The nextround of typographic enhancements to products such as Ventura Publisher willnarrow even further the gap between the low-cost, mass-market systems and thehigh-end, professional products.andP;  Textline has a lot of attractive featuresfor &quot;new-generation&quot; users, but it isn't priced to compete with Ventura.andP;  Ithas arrived in time to gain a significant market share, but there is no timeto lose.andM;Newport Technologies.andP;  Newport is headed by Peter Atwood, president, whoearlier spent 20 years with Xerox, including eight with Kurzweil.andP;  It wasformed in 1988 to assist U.S.andP;  and European organizations in internationaltrade, particularly to export and import PC-based composition systems,full-text retrieval programs, and related products.andM;It is located at 48 Wake Robin Rd., Sudbury, MA 01776; phone (508) 443-7877;fax (508) 443-6507.andM;One-for-OneandM;One-for-One sells several products used for high-volume composition, proofingand typesetting.andP;  The product line includes a complex high-end batchcomposition language (Versacomp) that has recently been ported to 386 PCs; asimpler batch pagination package, Optimum (which is actually an applicationwritten in Versacomp); and a software package for proof-printing files thatare to be typeset on high-volume typesetters, particularly those made byAutologic and Information International.andM;In the past, One-for-One has supported printers such as the HP LaserJet, theDEC LN03, and the Dataproducts 2655 for proofing.andP;  The 300-dpi machines havedone the job as proofers and (in a few applications) as sources ofcamera-ready copy.andP;  But most customers have continued to generate finalcamera copy on their typesetters.andM;At the seminar, One-for-One introduced support for a new printer, thePrintware 720 IQ.andP;  The features of this machine (600-dpi resolution with nicesolid blacks) make it attractive for fussier users to consider laser-printedcamera copy.andP;  The Printware machine was running in the booth, and the samplesit produced were impressive: One-for-One produced a newspaper classified-adpage reduced to 70% (to fit on the Printware's 8-1/2 X 11 page), and theresulting small type (around 4 pt.) was clear and readable.andP;  One-for-Onesells the printer for $15,420.andP;  It is driven directly by sending full-pagebitmaps from the PC and not via a page description language.andM;If you wanted to set yourself up with a complete One-for-One system to runbatch pagination with Printware output, here's a summary of the costsinvolved.andP;  First you would need a 386-based PC.andP;  One-for-One sells a Compaqat a price of $7,000 to $8,500, depending on options.andP;  The Optimum paginationsoftware is $12,000.andP;  The One-for-One soft-proofing module is $10,900 plusthe cost of a large-screen monochrome monitor (about $1,500).andP;  The Printwareprinter costs $15,420.andP;  Altogether, the price of the system would be between$45,000 and $50,000.andM;UltimateandM;Ultimate showed the latest release of its composition software (which wereviewed in Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  7) and its PostScript imposition software forPostScript-formatted pages (described in that same article).andM;At the Seminar, Ultimate showed us imposed sheets of negative film, ready forplatemaking, that had been produced via PostScript.andP;  We also got a chance totake a closer look at EasyTab, a software module Ultimate recently introducedto make tabular composition easier.andM;There are two parts to EasyTab.andP;  The first allows you to establish thetabular format; the second to input table data.andP;  You establish the tableformat by filling in a form.andP;  For each column of the table you want tocompose, it has entries for gutter size and position, alignments (bothvertical and horizontal), rules, and a number of other parameters.andP;  You canspecify widths for some columns and let EasyTab allocate space for the rest.andM;Once you've filled in the form, EasyTab provides an entry screen withreversed-out areas (white on a blue background) corresponding to each entryin each table row.andP;  You move from area to area, filling in data.andP;  You cancombine two or more of the reversed areas to make a straddle entry.andM;When the process is completed, the package generates all the coding for thecolumn definitions and the tabular data itself.andP;  This can then be merged intoanother file or typeset by itself.andP;  The software even puts comments in itsoutput so that you can see what the various codes are for.andM;EasyTab makes tables very straightforward.andP;  It frees users from thecode-intensive process normally associated with tables in Ultimate (and inmany other code-oriented systems).andP;  It makes Ultimate's tabular composition,which was already strong, accessible as well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
