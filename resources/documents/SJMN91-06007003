There was additional concern in SantaCruz that sympathy shoppers who drove in last year from San Jose to keepearthquake-crippled retailers afloat wouldn't come again.;    The San Joseshoppers didn't come, according to interviews with downtown business owners.But coast residents took up the slack.;    &quot;We've had the best year we've everhad in 15 years of business,&quot; said Julie Hendee, co-owner of Cat 'n' Canary.;   Hendee said sales were up at the clothing store 30 percent this Christmasseason from last year's record totals. In July, her store became one of thefirst displaced businesses to move into a Pacific Avenue storefront from atent, a risk she said has paid off.;    Thirty-three stores remain in fivePavilion tents. Most owners expect to wait at least another year for theirreplacement buildings to be built on Pacific Avenue.;    Although shoppersalways will go to Capitola Mall or other 41st Avenue stores for practicalitems like sheets, Santa Cruz businesses prospered because of their reputationfor providing unusual gifts, Hendee said.;    &quot;We have a loyal community,&quot; shesaid. &quot;In spite of the fact that most of downtown is destroyed, there is avibrant downtown. It just doesn't look like it.&quot;;    Another happy owner, MonaMartin of Integrand Design, 1515 Pacific Ave., doubled her staff to handle theshopping load and watched sales jump 10 percent over her previous recordyear.;    &quot;We were more than pleased,&quot; Martin said, adding that the18-year-old kitchen supply and furniture business benefited from faithfulrepeat customers.;    According to city figures, the quake destroyed 21 majorcommercial buildings in Santa Cruz. One-third of the city's 650 businessesdisappeared overnight. Today, about half of those lost businesses havereturned, and a handful of new ones have started.;    East Meets West, a newjewelry and exotic clothing import shop with locations in Capitola Village anda Pavilion tent, rang up more sales in Santa Cruz, said co-owner Kati Sutton.;   &quot;It barely picked up at all in Capitola,&quot; Sutton said, adding that in SantaCruz, &quot;We were doing three or four times our regular business.&quot;;    Not allstores boomed. Sales at Western Visions, an American Indian gift business,were off about 12 percent, said owner Carol Barnes.;    &quot;People seemed to bebuying less expensive items,&quot; she said. &quot;They would come in and say, 'Ihaven't been here since the quake,' and I'd say, 'Why not?' &quot;;    Othermerchants reported that they fared well because of high student volume; freeparking the city offered for four weekends in December; and a visiblepublicity campaign that stressed the importance of local residents keepingtheir money in town.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL ROGERS, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910107  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  612  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday January 7, 199100007003,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
