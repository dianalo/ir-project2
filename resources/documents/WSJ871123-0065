The problem, a company spokesman said, is a faulty ignition switch installed in all of the Sterling Luxury sedans imported from Britain's Austin Rover Group Ltd. since the Sterling model was introduced to the U.S. in February. Austin Rover Cars of North America is an affiliate of the Rover Group.    While an affected car will start, the defective switch could short out power to the headlights, radio, windshield wipers, heater and other electrical systems. Sterling dealers will replace the switch free of charge beginning Nov. 25. </TEXT></DOC>
