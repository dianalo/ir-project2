Barrett's comment on Edwin Markham's poem &quot;The Man With a Hoe,&quot; inspired by Millet's painting. The theme is in these stirring lines:    O masters, lords and rulers in all    lands,    How will the future reckon with this    man?    How answer his brute questions in that    hour    When whirlwinds of rebellion shake all    shores?    Mr. Barrett was reminded of China and the Soviet Union, and he asked whether stronger societies there could make these countries &quot;more formidable adversaries&quot; for the West and &quot;fiercer competition for diminishing resources.&quot;    I reply from history that poverty and hopelessness nourish the rise of dictators, whose demagoguery uses the carrot of a better life to raise armies by further impoverishing the populace.    Roy Campbell, born in South Africa, wrote (years after Markham) in &quot;The Serf&quot;:    The ploughman drives    Over the toppled clods and falling    flowers,    The timeless, surly patience of the    serf    That moves the nearest to the naked    earth    And ploughs down palaces, and    thrones, and towers.    Both of these poets sang a song of all mankind. Mr. Barrett and the rest of us should never fear that others, too, may achieve freedom, knowledge and security. Wars are made of lesser stuff.    Harry Polikoff    New York    ---   Rather than characterize the &quot;stirrings&quot; of China and the Soviet Union in the commercial perspective of &quot;more customers&quot; or the foreboding language of &quot;formidable adversaries,&quot; is it not possible to see in these awakenings the genesis of a new emergence of the importance of human rights? . . . remembering other words of Edwin Markham.    We are blind until we see    That in the human plan    Nothing is worth the making    If it does not make the man.    Why build these cities glorious    If man unbuilded goes?    In vain we build the world    Unless the builder also grows.    Edward F. Krieg    Washington    ---   Mr. Barrett suggests too strongly to be ignored that Edwin Markham's prophecy in &quot;The Man With a Hoe&quot; was fulfilled in China recently when Millet's &quot;Man With a Hoe&quot; demonstrated for reform.    I think not. I think the brutality with which the demonstrations were suppressed was possible only because the Chinese government judged, quite correctly, that the man with the hoe was not yet ready to lift it in support of the actual demonstrators, the students.    The peasant, typically, is an archconservative, not able to perceive the extent of his degradation and wholly supportive of authority.    By an extraordinary coincidence you quoted Edmund Burke's anticipatory refutation of Markham's romantic notion in the column adjacent to Mr. Barrett's essay: &quot;It is not to be imagined, because a political system is, under certain aspects, very unwise in its contrivance, and very mischievous in its effects, that it therefore can have no long duration. Its very defects may tend to its stability, because they are agreeable to its nature.&quot;    Failure to understand the political inertia of the man with the hoe can lead to suicidal miscalculations, as we demonstrated with the Bay of Pigs invasion.    John R. Powell    Pinckney, Mich.    ---   Mr. Barrett seems to have substituted a new line for one in the original. The original, as I have always known it, is:    When this dumb terror shall appeal    to God    After the silence of the centuries?    It now appears:    When this dumb terror shall rise to    the judge of the world,    After the silence of the centuries? This would appear to be not only without poetic license, but of course ruins the meter of the poem. I am wondering who granted the license, if such be the case; or is it in deference to the Soviets, who might prefer judge to &quot;God&quot;?    Heskin A. Whittaker    Orlando, Fla.    ---   In regard to questions concerning the changed line in Markham's poem: My source was &quot;The Britannica Library of Great American Writing,&quot; edited by Louis Untermeyer. It is hard for me to believe Mr. Untermeyer would have changed Markham's text, considering his stature in the literary world. I cannot help wondering if perhaps Markham, like W.B. Yeats, went on revising his works after they were published.    Richard F. Barrett    San Jose, Calif. </TEXT></DOC>
