One of the issues, a seven-year, $100 million offer by Mercedes Benz Credit Corp. through Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, was received enthusiastically and traded well within full fees, analysts said. Its pricing was considered ample and Mercedes is an influential Euromarket name, they added. The 8 1/2% bonds were priced at 100 3/4 to yield 8.72% less full fees.    But the other three were considered either priced too aggressively, or difficult to place for other reasons. They included $300 million by Portugal, $250 million by General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and $200 million by Swedish Export Credit Corp.    Secondary markets provided a favorable background for such offerings, however, with fixed-coupon Eurodollar issues posting slight gains on a moderate rise in U.S. Treasurys.    GECC, formerly General Electric Credit Corp., stirred significant controversy. The 7 3/4%, three-year issue was brought to market by lead manager LTCB International Ltd. at 35 basis points over the yield on U.S. Treasurys. Other bankers contended that the pricing wasn't commercially viable and reflected the Japanese bank's eagerness to lead an issue on behalf of a blue-chip U.S. corporate borrower.    A bank official agreed that the pricing, 101 1/4 to yield 7.80% less full fees, was &quot;very tight&quot; but said the bank nevertheless was finding investor interest in the bonds. He said the pricing had been viewed as attractive by several other U.S. companies that had expressed interest in tapping the Euromarket.    Other bankers were skeptical about Portugal's 8 1/4%, three-year issue, launched at about 90 basis points over U.S. Treasurys. They argued that the pricing, 101 1/8 to yield 8.35% less full fees, wasn't generous enough in light of the fact that this was Portugal's first fixed-coupon Eurodollar offer, making comparisons with seasoned issues difficult.    An official at Union Bank of Switzerland (Securities) Ltd., the lead manager, disagreed, contending that the Portugal paper provided a good yield premium over outstanding issues by sovereigns ranging from Belgium to Ireland. But he conceded that the issue might be unattractive to some institutional investors and said it probably would be placed &quot;gradually.&quot;    The Swedish Export 8 1/8%, four-year issue through Daiwa Europe Ltd. was priced at 101 1/4 to yield 7.75%. </TEXT></DOC>
