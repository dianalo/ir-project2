(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Voters on Saturday handed Gov. GastonCaperton an overwhelming defeat on three constitutional amendmentshe said were necessary to complete his reorganization of stategovernment.   With 99 percent of the vote counted, only one of the amendmentsgarnered as much as 19 percent support.   One of the amendments would have eliminated three statewideelected offices _ secretary of state, treasurer and agriculturecommissioner _ and placed their duties under the governor's control.   ``The people of West Virginia have scored a great victory at thepolls today,'' said Secretary of State Ken Hechler, an opponent ofthe amendments.   The second amendment would have given the governor greaterauthority over the state primary and secondary education system. Thethird would have given cities and counties the ability to merge orchoose new forms of government.   Caperton, who took office in January, said the voters rejectedthe proposals because the administration failed to fully explainthem.   ``I believe the defeat of these amendments was due in part to theinability to get our true message about these complex andcomplicated amendments across,'' he said in a statement.   Caperton had said the elimination of the three offices would savethe state about $3 million annually.   Thirty percent of the 828,000 registered voters participated inthe election. Clear weather with temperatures in the 80s and collegefootball games apparently proved too attractive to the bulk of thestate's voters.   The constitutional officers amendment was defeated 217,582, or 89percent, to 28,095, or 11 percent. The education amendment wasbeaten 217,727, or 88 percent, to 29,670, or 12 percent. Thecity-county amendment was rejected 199,507, or 81 percent, to46,573, or 19 percent.   ``Folks have not been fooled,'' said Agriculture CoimissionerCleve Benedict. ``The voters have seen through the high-poweredmedia and see they like to run state government themselves and Ithink that's the way it ought to be.''   In addition to Hechler, Agriculture Commissioner Cleve Benedictalso opposed the measure. The third officeholder whose job wouldhave been eliminated, Treasurer Thomas Loehr, supported Caperton'splan.   Meeting in special session earlier this year, the Legislaturegave Caperton the most extraordinary powers since the state wascreated in 1863 to reorganize 150 executive offices under sevenCabinet secretaries.   Lawmakers also heeded his call for the three constitutionalamendments, which he said was needed to complete that reorganization.   Opponents said the vote was a referendum on the administration,which also had the Legislature adopt the largest tax increase instate history.   In a debate last Thursday, Loehr predicted defeat for theamendments.   ``I think they're all in trouble,'' said Loehr, who was appointedby Caperton in July. ``People are fed up with government and that'sa shame. This was a good opportunity to restructure our stategovernment in a very positive way.''   Several state legislators have been indicted or resigned inrecent months, and the former treasurer and attorney generalresigned recently.   Respondents to a telephone survey conducted in August indicatedresidents would approve the amendment to allow the city-countygovernment merger, while saying they probably won't change the wayeducation is administered in the state nor would they abolish theelected offices.</TEXT></DOC>
