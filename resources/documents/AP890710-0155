The Soviet-backed government said guerrillas were preparing amid-July offensive on Kabul and provinces, and that governmentforces may shell neighboring Pakistan, where many of theU.S.-supported guerrillas are based.   The Supreme Military Council was to determine how to respond tothe latest shelling, which began at midnight Sunday and hit seven ofthe city's 11 districts, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad NabiAmani said.   Diplomatic sources said Afghanistan may issue an ultimatum toPakistan to restrain the guerrillas or face military action.   At the United Nations, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil saidPakistan was planning a new rebel offensive.   ``Materialization of this aggressive plan will oblige us to takedecisive and serious measures,'' Wakil said in a letter to U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.   In Kabul, Amani said: ``Our armed forces have the capacity toshell similar rockets on Pakistan territory.''   Amani also said government troops killed 208 guerrillas in anoperation against guerrilla bases in the Ghazi Abad and Chaprharareas in Nangarhar province, site of the deadliest battles in thedecade-old civil war.   The guerrilla-controlled Afghan news agency called the Kabulgovernment claims ``baseless.''   ``The reports we received were that three mujahedeen were killedin bombings at Ghazi Abad,'' the agency's Qaribur Rehman Saeed saidin Islamabad, Pakistan. The guerrillas call themselves mujahedeen,or Islamic holy warriors.   The provincial capital of Jalalabad, between Kabul and thePakistan border, has been under guerrilla siege since the last ofthe Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan on Feb. 15. Red Armysoldiers backed the Marxist government in Afghanistan for nine years.   In Monday's attacks, one rocket hit a downtown bus station,killing at least eight Afghans waiting to board a bus, witnessessaid on condition of anonymity. A second rocket struck a tailor'sshop and killed two people, witnesses said. A third hit the KabulHotel, but no casualties were reported.   It was not immediately known how the remaining 10 people werekilled.   The missile attack came several hours after a guerrilla rocketblew up an ammunition and weapons depot near the airport. Thegovernment barred reporters from visiting the depot.   Amani said the airport warehouse housed only flares used byaircraft to deflect the heat-seeking Stinger missiles supplied bythe United States to the guerrillas. But a U.N. official, speakingon condition of anonymity, said the explosion caused ``substantialloss.''   ``Soviet-supplied small arms and artillery and other ammunitionare stored in the depot before they are dispatched to army units inthe provinces,'' he said.   The blast and subsequent fire shortly after midnight rattled thecity of 2.25 million people and threw glowing shrapnel into thenight sky for two hours before turning into a towering column ofsmoke.   The guerrilla's Afghan News Agency in Islamabad said its gunnershit the Soviet Embassy in Kabul with 122mm cannon fire Thursday,killing eight people and wounding six. The report could not beconfirmed independently.   The agency said it did not know whether the injured were Sovietnationals. ``We are not sure. The person who told us said they werejust employees'' at the mission, said agency spokesman Abdut MalikAlnoor.   Monday's report also claimed the presidential palace was hit,killing 22 government soldiers.   At the United Nations, a Soviet Foreign Ministery statementMonday made no mention of the alleged embassy attack but said thaton July 2 a missile exploded near the embassy. The statement made nomention of casualties.</TEXT></DOC>
