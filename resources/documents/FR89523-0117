The proposed action is in accordance with the licensees' application foramendment dated January 18, 1989. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed change to the TS is required in order to provide the licenseesthe ability to operate the Suppression Pool Cleanup System without causinga residual heat removal (RHR) subsystem to become inoperable. Presently,the return of the Suppression Pool Cleanup System ties into either loopA or loop B of the RHR system upstream of the suppression pool isolationvalve. Opening this valve in the respective RHR loop drops pressure belowthe low pressure alarm setpoint rendering that loop inoperable. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision tothe TS and concludes that the proposed additional isolation valves andpiping provide single failure proof, seismic Category I quality, appropriatevalve closure time, remote control shutdown capability and leak tight barrierby a water seal for at least 30 days during an accident. Accordingly, theCommission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significantradiological environmental impact. The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forPrior Hearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 20, 1989 (54 FR 11463). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change tothe TS involves the addition of two containment isolation valves to theSuppression Pool Cleanup System. It does not affect nonradiological planteffluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commissionconcludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impactsassociated with the proposed amendment. Alternative to the Proposed Action Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement related to the operation of the PerryNuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2, dated August 1987. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff reviewed the licensees' request and did not consult otheragencies or persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.
