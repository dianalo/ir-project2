'' Hawke said in answer toquestions at the National Press Club.   Hawke said apartheid will be resolved one way or another and``the time is running out where the conflict can be resolved in acongenial, bloodless way.''   ``I trust ... that what will be done by the rest of the world isto keep up pressure, but to give the new leadership emerging inSouth Africa the opportunity of responding, getting them tounderstand that only by getting to the negotiating table in the nearfuture are we going to have the opportunity of a resolution of theconflict in a bloodless way,'' he continued.   Leaders of South Africa's black resistance movement, the AfricanNational Congress, and the black frontline countries bordering SouthAfrica want a multiracial society in the country, Hawke said. Theyrecognize that country's future prosperity depends on keeping thewhites, white capital and expertise, he said.   But those black leaders ``are running out of time with theiryounger generations,'' who question such an attitude when it bringsno positive response, he added.   Hawke described as ``silly'' the view of those who said that U.S.economic sanctions voted by Congress over former President RonaldReagan's veto failed to have the desired effect. He noted that boththe South African finance minister and central bank governoradmitted the sanctions had the impact of forcing a lowering ofstandards and expectations.   F. W. de Klerk, the new leader of South Africa's governingNational Party, is expected to succeed President P. W. Botha laterthis year and a de Klerk visit to Washington is under diplomaticdiscussion, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said lastweek.</TEXT></DOC>
