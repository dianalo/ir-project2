Two hypotheseshave been considered: (1) primary flow down the Columbia River and super-criticalvelocities through Sentinel Gap; (2) flow across the Scablands convergingon the Pasco Basin to produce a backwater curve at Sentinel Gap withdownstream elevation fixed (351m). Hypothesis one requires dischargesexceeding 34.6 Mcms to produce a hydraulic jump sufficient to yield theobserved high-water marks. This is greater than any estimate of MissoulaFlood discharges. At the greatest discharges reasonable (14 Mcms) whenflows are restricted to the Columbia River, super-critical velocitiesoccur in the gap with a hydraulic jump to only 298m. Hypothesis two impliessub-critical velocities and an Ml profile through Sentinel Gap. Dischargesof 7.5 Mcms yield, upstream of the gap, a water surface at 366 m. Velocitiesreach 16 m/sec in the gap -- an area of pronounced scouring. Tractiveforce exhibits a secondary minimum (of 66 N/m2) 14.8km downstream fromthe gap. A 12m transient wave could explain high water marks (363m) atthe eastern end of Saddle Mountain. They conclude that hypothesis twois the preferred explanation of observed evidence in the Pasco Basin.</TEXT></DOC>
