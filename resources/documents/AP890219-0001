That'sbecause he's a Christian and lives in east Beirut and the socialsecurity office is in west Beirut, the Moslem sector.   He is a victim of a bizarre political crisis in long-sufferingLebanon in which government institutions, including the army, havebeen split in two by rival Christian and Moslem Cabinets vying forpower.   The 64-year-old Helou, who has a heart ailment, has to rely onhis sons to pay for medicines for himself and his wife, who suffersfrom diabetes.   The power struggle threatens to cement the de facto partition ofLebanon.   Many of the country's estimated 4 million people, hardened by 14years of civil war, have taken this bureaucratic nightmare in theirstride, despite three weeks of bloody fighting between rival ShiiteMoslem factions in southern Lebanon.   But for thousands of people like Helou, it has made the dailystruggle for survival even more difficult.   State employees are still getting paid.   Lebanon still has gold reserves worth an estimated $2.5 billionstored at Fort Knox in Kentucky. But with foreign currency earningsdwindling, the central bank has turned to internal borrowing fromcommercial banks to supplement funds officials are able to collectin taxes, customs duties and other levies.   But pensioners like Helou have suffered. The social securitydepartment's board of directors has not been able to meet to endorsepension payments because Christian officials are afraid to cross thedividing Green Line into west Beirut.   Helou said in an interview: ``We need 30,000 Lebanese pounds($60) a month for medicines. I relied on my annual pension of 6million pounds ($12,000), but with two governments I can't get it.   ``Fortunately my sons are providing me with the medications forthe time being. But how long can this go on?''   The crisis began Sept. 22, when President Amin Gemayel's 6-yearterm ended without a successor being named.   Minutes before he stepped down, Gemayel named the commander ofthe Christian army, Gen. Michel Aoun, as the head of an interimmilitary Cabinet until a new president was elected.   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem,and other Moslem leaders refused to acknowledge Aoun.   The government lost its authority long ago and real politicalpower has rested with the heavily armed militias on both sides andtheir foreign allies, such as Syria and Israel.   Yet government departments handling social and economic matterscontinued to function after a fashion, just enough to maintain asemblance of normality. Now even that slender thread is in jeopardy.   Ghassan Bitar, a Christian municipal employee, said he and hiscolleagues have not been paid since September.   Bitar, 32, who has two children and a wife five months pregnant,said he had to turn his family Mercedes-Benz into a taxi to makeends meet.   ``I can't leave my family hungry,'' he said.   Rana Shehab's dreams of going to London to study medicine wereshatted Ms. Shehab, an18-year-old Moslem. ``The only alternative was to enroll in theAmerican University of Beirut.''   The university, which once was the most prestigious educationcenter in the Middle East, is now a shadow of that since its foreignprofessors were frightened off by a wave of kidnappings of itsAmerican and British lecturers and administrators.   But Ms. Shehab noted: ``It's better than nothing.''   An Education Ministry official, Sami Hamadi, said the authoritiesdecided not to issue certificates for students in either west oreast Beirut ``until the government is reunited.''   Even getting in and out of Lebanon has become a problem for somepeople.   ``Airport officials turned me back when they saw my passport wasrenewed in east Beirut,'' said Anis Saeed, a Christian, when hetried to leave through the airport in west Beirut.   ``I got my ticket refunded and now I'm going to take the ferry toCyprus from the Christian port of Jounieh,'' said Saeed, 24.   The Lebanese have learned how to survive under the most arduousconditions during the civil war, Israel's invasion in 1982 andendless factional feuding. But the cloning of what had passed fortheir government has exasperated many.   ``We're fed up,'' said Amal Hamdi, 28, a secretary in westBeirut. ``We want this chaos to end. However, if formal partitioningwould lead to security, stability and better living conditions, letit be.''   ``Let's either have formal partition or elect a new president,but let's finish and know where we stand,'' said Pierre Ayyoub, 36,who works at an east Beirut trading company.   Every government ministry now has two competing heads. The40,000-man army, the police and municipal departments are similarlysplit in two.   The only institution that has remained intact is the centralbank, which is financing both governments. It is in west Beirut.   Mohammed Hout, economic adviser to bank governor Edmond Naim,said the bank's main objective is to provide the basic needs ofpeople of both sides of the sectarian divide.   ``We extend advances to both governments to cover wages andsalaries for the public sector, to import essential commodities suchas fuel and flour and spare parts to maintain such services aselectricity and water,'' Hout explained.   ``We pay military salaries on both sides, but we won't advancemoney for purchasing armaments.''   The Christian Aoun has been pressing to impose his disputedauthority on the central bank and in December he closed the onlycrossing point on the Green Line in a move widely seen asretaliation for the bank's providing $100,000 to Moslem units.   The 10-day closure kept food and fuel from reaching west Beirutfrom the Christian sector, where the main government warehouses aresituated.   Aoun lifted the blockade after Christian business interestscomplained they were unable to sell their goods in Moslem sectors.</TEXT></DOC>
