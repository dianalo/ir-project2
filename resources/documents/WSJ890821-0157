We who are struggling to keep small towns alive in rural America depend upon rehabilitation to preserve what's left of our communities. We depend upon property owners to maintain their buildings so we can keep retail and services in our downtowns. If the owners get a tax credit in the process, so be it. The alternative can be seen in far too many towns: crumbling, vacant buildings lining deserted main streets. Rehabilitation is only one part of our overall economic-development strategy, but it has been proved that physical improvements to buildings do have a positive impact on retail sales.    In our neck of the woods, preservation is not a matter of gentrification. It's a matter of survival.    Nancy D'Ambrosio    Executive Director    Mainstreet Aberdeen    Aberdeen, S.D.    ---   Your editorial tars tax-act rehabilitation of historic buildings with a pejorative term it doesn't deserve. Gentrification is defined as turning low-cost housing into high-cost. That's not what is going on.    For example, in the Hartford area the old Royal Typewriter factory of more than a half-million square feet is being turned into 400 apartments, half of them &quot;affordable&quot; as defined by government programs. Several years ago, in the Clemens Place project, dozens of rundown, vacant small apartment houses were rehabilitated, with the units renting at market rates of $600 to $800, which is reasonable for Hartford. In the Clay Hill Project, 25 multifamily homes were rehabilitated for low-income families. The single-room-occupancy Arrawani Hotel was rehabilitated for continued use as single occupancy.    The list of current rehabilitations that are converting vacant or underutilized industrial and commercial space into reasonably priced housing is long, but in no case is low-priced housing being turned into high-priced housing. Gentrification is a bum rap. The high-priced historic properties listed for sale in the Preservation News classified ads have nothing to do with the 1986 Tax Reform Act. They are totally irrelevant. The person who wrote the editorial did not do his homework.    David F. Ransom    Architectural Historian    West Hartford, Conn. </TEXT></DOC>
