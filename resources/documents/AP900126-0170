Havel said he planned to organize a meeting in April ofgovernment and opposition leaders from Poland, Hungary andCzechoslovakia. He said the foreign ministers of Austria, Italy andYugoslavia also would be invited to the conference in Bratislava,capital of Slovakia.   ``The purpose would be to discuss not only the possibilities ofour return to Europe, but also the sort of Europe we want to returnto,'' said the Czechoslovak president, a playwright who was hiscountry's leading dissident before Communist rule crumbled lastmonth.   Havel did not mentioned precise areas of possible cooperationand said policy coordination would not interfere with individualprojects involving outside countries.   He said Czechoslovakia had accepted an invitation by PresidentMatyas Szueroes of Hungary to link policies with Austria, Hungary,Italy and Yugoslavia.   Poland and Czechoslovakia also are initiating ``northern Balticcooperation, with Czechoslovakia acting as a link'' with Austria,Hungary, Italy and Yugoslavia,'' Havel added, without givingdetails.   It was not clear whether that project would extend to the threeSoviet Baltic republics, which seek autonomy or independence.   On a visit Thursday to Warsaw, Havel proposed thatCzechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary work together to rejoin Europeas politically independent states.   In a brief address to Poland's parliament, he expressed hopethat ``the Prague parliament, too, will soon be a real parliament,with a strong and intelligent opposition sitting across from me inthe chamber.''   Czechoslovakia plans free elections in June. Hungary's electionsare scheduled for March.</TEXT></DOC>
