With the House and Senate both controlled by Democrats, Bush willface ``a nine-month siege, not a 100-day breakthrough,'' predictedMitchell Daniels, a former political adviser for President Reaganwho also worked in the Bush-Quayle campaign.   Indeed, the incoming president himself said in a recent interviewthat he would ``feel like a spring colt'' if it were not for thefiscal challenges accompanying his elevation on Friday to what hecalled ``the ultimate'' job.   Even as he struggles with the deficit, Bush also will givepriority to refining his strategy for dealing with the Soviet Unionin the rapidly changing climate under Mikhail Gorbachev, officialssaid.</TEXT><DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Moscow's recent readiness to disarm hasboosted Western hopes that new negotiations to reduce conventionalarms in Europe will enjoy more success than the 15-year-old talksthey replace.   NATO and the Warsaw Pact initialed a mandate for negotiations onConventional Armed Forces in Europe on Saturday after aGreek-Turkish dispute was solved by an ambiguous compromise.

Her descendants went on to colonize Europe and Asia, perhapsaided by an ability to speak that had not yet appeared in humans inthose areas, said Allan C. Wilson, a biochemist at the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley.   Wilson's intriguing speculations about language are based onexhaustive comparisons of genetic material from people around theworld.   Two years ago, Wilson attracted the interest of scientists andthe public when he concluded that all humans are descendants of awoman in Africa, who was inevitably dubbed ``Eve.''</TEXT><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   People infected with AIDS may be able toslow the progression of the deadly disease by positive thinking,exercise, support from friends and other ways of reducing stress,studies presented Sunday suggest.   But some AIDS researchers at the annual meeting of the AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science cast doubt on the theoryand others cautioned that such improvements often are small.   ``The jury is still out'' on whether positive thinking and otherways of coping with stress might delay development of AIDS ininfected people or postpone death in those who have the disease,said Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, a clinical psychologist at the OhioState University College of Medicine.   ``We encourage people (infected with the AIDS virus) to do thingsthat may be helpful and certainly can't be harmful,'' such asexercising, getting adequate sleep and nutrition and avoiding drugsand alcohol, said Dr. Karl Goodkin, a psychiatrist at the Universityof Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.</TEXT></DOC>
