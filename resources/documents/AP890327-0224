(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Medical International Inc.is pondering a $1.68 billion offer to take the company private aswell as a restructuring plan by senior management that would keepit publicly traded.   ``No determination has been made to sell the company or engagein any other transaction,'' the hospital company said in astatement, adding that it appointed a committee of six outsidedirectors to evaluate the proposals.   Both proposals were revealed Sunday.   The $1.68 billion debt-financed takeover plan, proposed byminority shareholder Dr. M. Lee Pearce of Miami and and aninvestment group, offers $24 a share for American Medical stock,including $20 to $22 in cash and the remainder in securities. Underthis offer, the buyers also would assume some $1.4 billion inlong-term debt.   Pearce, who already owns nearly 10 percent of the company's 70million shares, is making the offer with Shamrock Investments, aprivate Los Angeles investment firm. It is unrelated to ShamrockHoldings Inc., the investment firm controlled by Roy E. Disney.   American Medical also said it is pondering a restructuringproposal, which it didn't describe in detail. That proposal,developed by an unidentified investment banking firm and seniormanagers, would keep the company in public hands, and ``couldprovide over a six- to nine-month period total shareholder value ofbetween $25 and $29 per share, including a special cash divided,''the company said.   The company said its recently named chairman and chiefexecutive, Richard A. Gilleland, is officially neutral on the twoproposals, which were presented to American Medical's board onThursday.   The company has been subject to takeover speculation because ofdisappointing earnings and the depressed value of its shares, whichreportedly led to last summer's forced resignation of Walter L.Weisman as chief executive.   A statement from Shamrock said the investors ``think we can dofar better if not subjected to the quarterly pressures ofinvestors.''   American Medical reported Friday that its earnings declined to$18.1 million, or 26 cents per share, for the three months endingFeb. 28, on revenues of $678.2 million. During the same period ayear earlier, earnings were $24.1 million, or 30 cents per share,on revenues of $766.1 million.   The decline in earnings was attributed primarily to the sale of36 hospitals to an employee-owned company, Epic Healthcare Group ofDallas. AMI retains 55 hospitals and psychiatric treatment centersin the United States and 20 facilities overseas.</TEXT></DOC>
