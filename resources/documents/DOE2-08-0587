In the basis of eight configurations we show thatin the deuteron in addition to the 6q component (the s{sup 6} configuration)at short distances an important role is played by the NN node component(a superposition of the excited configurations) which is orthogonal tothe former. The two components have comparable probabilities and interferedestructively.</TEXT></DOC>
