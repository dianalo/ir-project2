The environment took center stage at last year's summitmeeting in Paris, which produced a communique calling for&quot;decisive action&quot; to protect the Earth's environment. Butthis year, the U.S. is pushing hard to de-emphasizeenvironmental issues.</LP><TEXT>   The environment &quot;is a much tougher area&quot; for the U.S. todiscuss at the summit this year, says a U.S. officialinvolved in planning the Houston meeting. &quot;There's a distinctdifference in perspective in feelings of urgency between theU.S. and some of the other summit nations,&quot; particularly onthe issue of global climate change.   The European summit nations have been pushing hard to getagreement on a schedule for reducing the level of &quot;greenhousegases&quot; in the atmosphere. These gases, such as carbondioxide, are blamed by many scientists and environmentalistsfor a gradual increase in the Earth's temperature. But theU.S. and, to some extent, the Japanese have steadfastlyrefused to make such a commitment, arguing more scientificstudy is needed.   U.S. officials hope to shift the summit participants'attention this week to issues like coordinating assistance tothe emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and improvinginternational responses to fighting terrorism and illegaldrugs.   Environmentalists are already condemning the expectedshift, saying whatever progress resulted from last year'sintense focus on environmental issues is in danger of beinglost. &quot;Paris far and away broke new ground,&quot; says James T.B.Tripp, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, alobbying group on environmental issues. &quot;Statements aboutpopulation and tropical forests had been in previouscommuniques, but in Paris more than a third of the finalcommunique was devoted to domestic and global environmentalissues.&quot;   &quot;It was an important and major breakthrough,&quot; he says. &quot;Itshowed that the leaders of the world recognized that theenvironment, putting investment in energy efficiency,conservation, forestry and pollution control were central tothe long-term economic benefit of not only the industrializedworld but the entire world.&quot;   Still, Mr. Tripp believes that although &quot;the communiquewas very strong in terms of policy statements, it was weak interms of setting forth programs for action and schedules foraction.&quot; His group, in coalition with a number of other U.S.and international environmental organizations, is developinga &quot;scorecard&quot; of the seven summit nations. Issues on whichthey are being rated include population control and oceandumping; preserving the global environment by reducing carbondioxide emissions and improving energy efficiency; protectingdiverse ecosystems such as reefs, wetlands and tropicalforests; and aiding Eastern Europe in correcting some of itsserious environmental problems.   An early draft version of the environmental portion of thesummit communique drawn up by the U.S., and subject torevision by the summit partners, demonstrates the cautiousapproach favored by the Bush administration and stands insharp contrast to the sense of urgency the summit partnersprojected in 1989.   Last year's final communique said that the seven summitnations &quot;strongly advocate common efforts to limit emissionsof carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which threatento induce climate change, endangering the environment andultimately the economy.&quot;   U.S. summit writers this year propose saying they agreethat &quot;increased greenhouse gas emissions are capable ofaltering the global environment, albeit in a not yetpredictable manner.&quot; And while they urge steps to adjust toglobal climate change, such steps, they say, must be&quot;justified on independent grounds&quot; and not subject to&quot;scientific and economic uncertainties.&quot; They say, too, theybelieve it is &quot;premature to set specific targets ortimetables to stabilize or reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&quot;   The draft communique also proposes additional steps tosupport scientific research, to preserve wetlands andtropical forests, to prevent ocean pollution, and to promoteenvironmental awareness in the developing world by supportingenvironmentally sound development projects.   Despite environmentalists' fears about a lack of progresson their issues, other analysts say that such meetings areworthwhile for their public-relations value, and that realprogress has to be made in other venues and through eachcountry's own domestic policies.   &quot;There aren't many substantive things that summits likethis can accomplish,&quot; says Daniel Mitchell, a fellow inpolitical economy at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, aconservative think tank. In the end, he says, &quot;domesticpolitical things drive these issues.&quot;   ---   Ms. McQueen is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's Washington bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
