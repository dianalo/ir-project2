After decades of building a defense system based on aprojected conflict with the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization's forces in Europe, Soviet generals got a goodlook during the Gulf war at NATO performance. And, althoughIraqi forces aren't directly comparable to Moscow's, Iraq islargely Soviet-armed and trained in Soviet battlefieldstrategy.</LP><TEXT>   What they have seen clearly worries the Soviet military.Some hard-liners respond by trying to deny the scale of theallied victory. Others, such as Defense Minister DmitriYazov, play down the failure of Soviet equipment whilearguing for higher defense spending. But the allied victorymay ultimately give new force to reformers who are callingfor a smaller, technologically more sophisticated andprofessional military, and who argue that it is time to jointhe West, not try to beat it.   Pro-reform parliament deputies, democrats and servicemenat a meeting yesterday said the Gulf war showed that Sovietmilitary doctrine is outdated and proved the advantages of ahighly professional force over a mass army based onconscription.   &quot;It's simply impossible to continue to reject the idea ofdeep military reform from bottom to top,&quot; says SergeiBlagovolin, head of the military department of theinfluential Institute for World Economy and InternationalRelations. The Gulf war &quot;plays in our favor because it'sabsolutely clear that these sophisticated weapons can't beused with high efficiency without an adequate level ofpreparation of personnel, and will also demand a new kind ofcommander.&quot;   Since World War II, Soviet military doctrine hasemphasized the use of infantry and huge amounts of armor,backed by the firepower of massed artillery. Soviet Cold Wardeployment in central Europe reflected this policy. TheIraqis, largely trained by Soviet experts, fought the war onthis same premise. The main lesson for the Soviet army, Col.Alexander Tsalko told Tass, the official news agency, is&quot;that huge amounts of armored vehicles, tanks and artillerypieces were absolutely useless.&quot;   The strength of the coalition and the speed of its victoryalso give ammunition to military leaders who have longresisted any cuts in defense spending or troop size. DefenseMinister Yazov told Parliament last week that the success ofU.S. air attacks against ground forces &quot;necessitates a reviewof the attitude to army air defense and the country's entireair defense system.&quot;   Mr. Yazov said that the best elements of the Iraqi airdefense, including its French Mirage and Soviet MIG-29fighters, weren't fairly tested because they were poorlydeployed. But he admitted that the Soviet air defense systemhas &quot;weak spots.&quot;   Some military leaders argue that the weakness in Iraq'sdefense wasn't Soviet equipment, it was Iraqi soldiers. TheSoviet equipment in Iraq's arsenal was a generation or twobehind the allies, argued Maj. Gen. Nikolai Kutsenko, deputydirector of the Center for Operational-Strategic Research ofthe Soviet general staff. But Iraqi soldiers failed toproperly use or maintain even that equipment, he told thegovernment daily Izvestia last week.   Others deny the scale of the allied success. &quot;I do notbelieve official reports on the coalition losses,&quot; Col.Nikolai Petrushenko, a leader of the hardliner Soyuz (Union)group of parliament members and a political military officer,told Tass. &quot;Only a very naive person can believe that duringa month and half of preparations for the war, the U.S. lost80 people while more than a month of hostilities claimed atotal of 70 men killed or wounded.&quot; (According to alliedofficials, as of yesterday there were 154 coalition troopskilled in action, including 95 Americans; fifty-eightAmericans were listed as non-combat deaths during thefighting. An additional 105 Americans deployed to the Gulfdied in accidents before the start of combat.)   Some Soviets are arguing that the allied victory meansNATO will see itself as the world's policeman and willpresent a greater danger than ever to the Soviet Union. &quot;Canit be that this experience would prompt some people in theNATO leadership to invest the alliance with gendarmefunctions in Asia, Africa or Latin America,&quot; wrote VikentyMatveyev, a political analyst, in Izvestia. &quot;What is then theworth of NATO leaders' words about a `new peace order inEurope?'&quot;   Such concerns have serious implications for theconventional forces and strategic arms treaty negotiationsthat both Washington and Moscow hoped to have signed by now.In particular, the significant role played by navy forces andartillery in the Gulf could stiffen the Soviet position inthe talks, analysts say.   The U.S. has all along refused to include navy forces inthe negotiations to reduce conventional forces in Europe.Ratification of a treaty is now stalled because the SovietUnion suddenly tried to reclassify three ground divisions aspart of its navy so that they won't be counted.   Likewise, the U.S. has insisted that sea-launched cruisemissiles be excluded from the strategic arms negotiations,while the Soviet Union sought and failed to have themincluded. The highly effective use of sea-launched Tomahawkmissiles in the Persian Gulf is likely to raise thecontroversy again.</TEXT></DOC>
