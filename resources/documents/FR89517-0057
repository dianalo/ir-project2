(Services),also an Illinois corporation, with its principal office in Wheeling, Illinois.Services and its subsidiaries are engaged in the development, ownership,operation and maintenance of cogeneration projects. Indeck-Oswego is currentlyconstructing a new 50-megawatt gas-fired cogeneration facility adjacentto the International Paper/Hammermill Paper Company plant near Oswego,New York. The cogenerator is expected to be completed and in commercialoperation by June 1, 1990. It will be operated as a ``qualifying facility''under Section 201 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.In addition, Indeck-Oswego has filed a Certification of Compliance withthe coal capability requirement for proposed new electric powerplants pursuantto the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, as amended (53 FR35544, September 14, 1988).Indeck-Oswego states that all the natural gas imported under its requestedauthorization will be used to fuel the new cogeneration facility. Underanticipated normal operating conditions, the cogenerating facility willconsume an average of about 12,000 Mcf per day. Indeck-Oswego asserts thatits request for authority to import up to 4.5 Bcf per year is necessaryto meet the facility's fuel needs, allow for transportation shrinkage,and provide a reasonable margin for any unforeseen exigency. The electricpower to be produced by the facility is under contract for sale to NiagaraMohawk Power Corporation (Niagara Mohawk).  Indeck-Oswego will buy the Canadian gas from Indeck Gas Supply Corporation(Supply), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Services, in accordance with theirgas purchase agreement dated December 27, 1988. Supply has agreed to selland deliver up to a maximum of 14 MMcf of gas per day and up to an annualcontract quantity of 4.5 Bcf. The price will equal Supply's weighted averagecost of the gas delivered to Indeck-Oswego, including a management feedescribed below, and all costs related to transportation in Canada by NOVACorporation of Alberta and TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TCPL) to thepoint at the international border where Indeck-Oswego receives the volumes.The term of the agreement between Indeck-Oswego and Supply extends throughJanuary 1, 2006, with provision for extension for subsequent periods ofone year, until terminated by a 12-month notice in writing by either party.Indeck-Oswego estimates that the delivered price it will pay Supply duringthe first year of the proposed import arrangement would be $2.52 per Mcf.Indeck-Oswego bases this estimate on its calculation of Supply's weightedaverage cost of gas per Mcf purchased from producers under four contractssubmitted as part of this application.  The volumes of gas that Supply has available for resale to Indeck-Oswegowill be provided by Northstar Energy Corporation (Northstar), ChesapeakeResouirces Ltd., <T3>et al. </T3>(Chesapeake, <T3>et al.</T3>), and Bow Valley Industries, Ltd. (Bow Valley). Together,those Canadian producers contractually agreed to sell to Supply, on a firmbasis, a total of up to 25.8 MMcf per day and up to 9.34 Bcf of naturalgas per year as well as up to .33 Bcf of natural gas per year on an interruptiblebasis. According to the application, after TCPL's transportation shrinkageallowance, estimated to be approximately 7 percent, these volumes net Supplya total of 9.0 Bcf per year or up to 24.0 MMcf per day for export at theinternational border. Of the total volumes purchased by Supply from theproducers, 4.5 Bcf per year or 12.0 MMcf per day will be sold to Indeck-Oswego.The remaining 4.5 Bcf purchased annually will be sold by Supply to Indeck-Oswego'saffiliate, Indeck-Yerkes Energy Services, Inc. (Indeck-Yerkes), to fuela cogeneration facility it is planning to build near Tonawanda, New York.Indeck-Yerkes has an application for authority to import that gas fromSupply pending before the DOE in FE Docket No. 89-21-NG.  Indeck-Oswego states that the four contracts encompassing the entire quantityof gas purchased by Supply will be administered by a single producer, BowValley. Bow Valley will also act as Supply's liaison with TCPL for thetransportation of Supply's gas through TCPL's system. For this service,Bow Valley will receive a fee from Supply of approximately $0.02 (U.S.)per Mcf of purchased gas which will be included in the price of gas paidby Indeck-Oswego.  Indeck-Oswego described Supply's gas purchase agreements with the Canadianproducers as follows:  <ITAG tagnum="84">A. Northstar Agreement</ITAG>Under the Northstar gas purchase agreement, Supply will purchase with alump sum payment in the amount of $13.65 million (U.S.) to be paid on November1, 1989, a total volume of 26 million MMBtu (approximately 26 Bcf) of naturalgas to be delivered over a maximum term of 18 years. Additionally, Supplywill reimburse Northstar for its actual production taxes, and gatheringand processing costs, based on an initial rate of $.315 (U.S.) per MMBtu.This initial rate is to be increased annually by an amount equal to thegreater of five percent or the U.S. GNP deflator commencing on January1, 1989. Supply will reimburse Northstar for all related royalty paymentsand all transportation costs to the point of delivery near Empress, Alberta.Supply also agreed to a minimum take of at least 6,000 MMBtu of gas perday and contends that it is highly unlikely that Supply will be unableto take at least that amount at any time during the term because the averagecombined daily requirements of the two cogeneration facilities consumingthis gas is estimated to total 24,000 Mcf per day.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Chesapeake, et al., Agreement</ITAG>The Chesapeake group of producers have agreed to sell Supply a total ofup to 7,078 Mcf per day of natural gas over an initial term of 15 years.Additional non-firm volumes may be purchased if needed in any year. Underthe Chesapeake agreement, Supply will take title to the gas delivered tothe Alberta border at an initial price of $1.67 (U.S.) per Mcf. CommencingJanuary 1, 1991, and each year thereafter, the contract price will escalateby three percent of the preceding contract year price. Supply also agreedto pay an annual bonus set by a formula essentially fixing the price ofthe gas, subject to ceiling amounts, to the price received by the Oswegocogeneration project for electric power sold to Niagara Mohawk. The bonuspayments would start in 1992, when the maximum bonus payment would be $.12per Mcf and could gradually rise to a maximum of $3.75 per Mcf in 2004as the price paid for the electric power exceeds the specified floor ratewhich increases beginning in 1998.The Chesapeake contract volumes will be produced from dedicated reservesthat are to be verified annually by an independent engineering firm. Further,in the event the firm sales volumes ae not delivered, Supply's agreementprovides that the Chesapeake producers must reimburse Supply for the reasonablecost of securing substitute production from other sources.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Bow Valley Agreements</ITAG>Supply has two contracts with Bow Valley, dated February 13, and March13, 1989, under which Bow Valley will sell Supply, on a firm basis, a combinedtotal of up to 12,500 Mcf of Canadian natural gas per day for an initialterm of 15 years. Supply has agreed to take or pay for a total of 4.56Bcf of gas per year, but is given the right to receive any prepaid volumesat any time up to two years after the end of the term of the agreements.Supply will take title to the gas at a point of interconnection betweenBow Valley's and TCPL's transmission facilities located in Saskatchewan.The pricing provisions of Bow Valley's February agreement are identicalto those of the Chesapeake agreement. The initial price will be $1.67 (U.S.)per Mcf and escalates each year by three percent, plus a bonus to be determinedunder the same formula contained in the Chesapeake contract. The Marchagreement provides for the same $1.67 price and bonus formula, but providesfor a four percent annual escalation to the initial price. Bow Valley hasagreed to pay for the transportation to its interconnection with TCPL andany Canadian taxes, royalties and duties assessed on the delivered gas.Bow Valley will guarantee delivery of at least 12,500 Mcf per day fromits own reserves and has agreed to secure substitute production from othersources in the event it incurs a production problem or for some other reasoncannot deliver the contract volume as agreed.The point of delivery for the gas imported by Indeck-Oswego to enter theU.S. will be at an interconnection between TCPL and a new border facilitynear and parallel to the existing facilities of Tennessee Gas PipelineCompany (Tennessee) in the vicinity of Niagara Falls, New York. Indeck-Oswegostates that national Fuel Gas Supply (National) will transport up to 12,000Mcf per day of its imported gas on a firm basis from Niagara Falls throughthe new Niagara Spur Loop Line that would be constructed and jointly ownedby Tennessee, National, and PennEast Gas Service Company, to a point ofinterconnection with the existing facilities of CNG Transmission Corporation(CNG) at Marilla, New York. From this point, the import will be deliveredby CNG to Niagara Mohawk's system for subsequent delivery to Indeck-Oswego'scogeneration facility.In support of its application, Indeck-Oswego states that the imported gasis needed as a long-term fuel supply for its new cogeneration facilityand that the gas would be purchased under competitive pricing terms withsufficient flexibility to assure that the imported gas would remain competitiveover the term of the requested authorization. Indeck-Oswego further assertsthat Supply's agreements with its several Canadian sources of supply assuresit a secure supply of gas over the term.The decision on Indeck-Oswego's application for import authority will bemade consistent with the DOE's gas import policy guidelines, under whichthe competitiveness of an import arrangement in the markets served is theprimary consideration in determining whether it is in the public interest(49 FR 6684, February 22, 1984). Other matters that may be considered inmaking a public interest determination include need for gas, security ofthe long-term supply, and any relevant issues that may be unique to cogenerationfacilities. Parties that may oppose this application should comment intheir responses on the issues of competitiveness, need for the gas, andsecurity of supply as set forth in the policy guidelines. The applicantasserts that this import arrangement is in the public interest becauseit is competitive and its gas source will be secure. Parties opposing theimport arrangement bear the burden of overcoming these assertions.All parties should be aware that if the requested import is approved, theauthorization would be conditioned on the filing of quarterly reports indicatingvolumes imported and the purchase price.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Compliance</ITAG>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires the DOE to give appropriate consideration tothe environmental effects of its proposed actions. The FERC, in DocketNos. CP88-94-000, CP88-194-000, and CP88-171-000, encompassing the projectsof National and Tennessee, is currently performing an environmental reviewof the impacts of constructing and operating the proposed pipeline facilitiesthrough which National would transport the import before making its decisionon the certificate applications. The DOE will participate in the environmentalreview process at the appropriate level. No final decision will be issuedin this proceeding until the DOE has met its NEPA responsibilities regardingthe Indeck-Oswego application.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable and written comments.
