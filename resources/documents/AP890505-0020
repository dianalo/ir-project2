A patriot convicted ofcrimes against the United States.   A federal jury delivered that last, cruelest cut of all Thursdayto the already fractured image of Oliver L. North, pronouncing himboth innocent and guilty at the same trial.   Guilty, of falsifying and destroying documents, of abetting theobstruction of Congress, of accepting an illegal gratuity.   Innocent of nine other felony charges linked to his role asaction officer in the Iran-Contra affair.   In reaching its verdict, the jury had to consider whether thisformer lieutenant colonel and staff member of the National SecurityCouncil was true to his government and his mission, or whether hisdeceits, principally to Congress, were the designs of a rogueoperating outside the law.   North left the courtroom just as he arrived _ eyes straightahead, shoulders squared, no display of emotion save for a briefembrace with his wife.   Later, he would issue this statement: ``As a Marine I was taughtto fight _ and fight hard _ for as long as it takes to prevail. Wewill continue this battle, and with the support and prayers of theAmerican people I will be fully vindicated.''   The central figure in the worst foreign policy debacle of RonaldReagan's presidency, North came to run some of the administration'sriskiest ventures from a cluttered room, No. 392, in the OldExecutive Office Building next door to the White House.   Congress tried for months to unravel the mysteries surroundingNorth. But, like the 1987 commission headed by former Sen. JohnTower, congressional panels left many questions unanswered.Meanwhile, in nationally televised hearings, a defiant Oliver Northemerged from his shadowy world, one of pseudonyms and codes andfurtive border crossings, to confront his tormentors.   ``Ollie stood up there, took the heat, and the American peoplein every bar in Chicago and every bowling alley in Texas and everylittle home said, `Hey, this guy believes in something, and I canidentify with it,''' said George Bush last December.   North's bravado, and his subsequent whirlwind of $25,000speeches to cheering conservatives around the country, revealedjust one of his many sides.   He has always been ``Ollie'' to his White House co-workers andthe American right. But to his brothers and sisters, hishigh-school chums back in Philmont, N.Y., he remains Larry North.To surviving members of his Vietnam combat platoon, he is ``Blue,''leader of ``Blue's Bastards.'' In other travels, he has been``Paul,'' or ``Mr. Goode,'' or ``Mr. Johns,'' or ``Steelhammer.''   Another code name may be most telling: ``Blank Check.'' That wasthe term assigned to the private, interoffice computercommunications network between North and his superior, formerNational Security Adviser John M. Poindexter. The Tower commissionfound that the creation of ``Blank Check'' coincided with theinitial shipment of anti-tank missiles to Iran, 14 months beforethe scheme blew up in the Reagan administration's face in late 1986.   According to Richard Allen, Reagan's first national securityadviser, North was brought to the NSC in 1981 ``to handle easelsand carry the charts.'' Yet he became, in a matter of months, theNSC's chief troubleshooter.   He was there for the invasion of Grenada in 1983; initial armsshipments by the CIA to the Nicaraguan rebels, also in 1983; themining of three harbors in Nicaragua in early 1984; a crackdown onthe death squads in El Salvador; the interception of an Egyptianairliner carrying the hijackers of the cruise ship Achille Lauro;and the bombing raid on Libya in 1986.   Part of North's ascendancy, no doubt, can be attributed to hisown fervor. ``If there was a loose ball,'' said retired Maj. Gen.John Singlaub, a key player in North's efforts to aid the Contras,``Oliver North would grab it and run with it.''   As a youth, he was kept on a tight leash. His father, OliverClay North, an Army colonel who won a Silver Star in World War II,worked long hours at a family wool mill before it fell victim topolyester and he switched to teaching history.   His mother, Ann, would whistle for the kids to come in everyevening at 5 p.m. for dinner. Family ritual included a discussionof world events before the table was cleared. In school, he rantrack and was in the chorus, chess, drama and science clubs as wellas the student council. The girls voted him best-looking.   He was a southpaw boxer at the Naval Academy, making it into theintramural finals against a highly favored James Webb, later tobecome Navy secretary. North won again, on points.   After his graduation, a review board threatened to dismiss himbecause of injuries suffered earlier in a car wreck. North made theboard look at the film of his fight against Webb. He got hiscommission.   Soon after North and Betsy Stuart were married, North wasshipped out to Vietnam, where he led the second platoon, K Company,3rd Battalion, Third Marines. Once, despite broken ribs and apunctured lung, North rose up to kill an enemy gunner with agrenade. That got him a Bronze Star.   But North, in recounting his Vietnam record, has sometimesseemed to exaggerate. He has testified that his decorationsincluded ``several'' purple hearts; military records show two. Heheaded a platoon of 40 men, but said in court that he was a companycommander ``in the Special Operations Force.'' Again, no record ofit. He has said in court that he was in Vietnam from 1968 throughearly 1970'' and then again ``in 1971,'' but the corps says it hasno record of an extended first tour or second tour.   After tours at Quantico, Va., and in Okinawa, North wound upwith a desk at Marine Corps headquarters. He worked 18 hours a day.   Something finally snapped. North wound up in Bethesda NavalHospital for 22 days, diagnosed as suffering ``delayed battlestress.'' Once again, he overcame his difficulties and was clearedfor duty.   By 1980, he was off for a year of study at the Naval WarCollege, a necessary ticket for a would-be star. Classmatesremember he always sat in the front row, always flattered hislecturers. They didn't much like it, but the brass, including NavySecretary John Lehman, was impressed.   When it came time to fill a deputy's slot at the NationalSecurity Council, North was the man.   One of his responsibilities was coordinating anti-terrorismpolicies, a license for him to roam the world. It was not unusualfor him to jet off at night to another country and be back for theNSC's regular staff meeting at 7:45 a.m.   He flew on White House jets, chartered jets, and commercialairlines, often using false names and oddball disguises. RichardAllen called it a ``rinky-dink'' habit.   But North did get things done. His finest hour was theapprehension of the hijackers of the Achille Lauro, the Italiancruise liner seized by Palestinians who killed an Americanpassenger, Leon Klinghofer. With the help of Israeli intelligence,North determined that the perpetrators, who had surrendered toEgyptian authorities, were to be flown to asylum in Tunisia. Hemapped out a plan whereby Navy fighter jets intercepted the planeand forced it to land at a NATO base in southern Italy.   North's response in that case, triggered by the sickening,wanton murder of the wheelchair-ridden Klinghofer, reflected anobsessive concern for innocent suffering. He kept pictures of theAmerican hostages in Lebanon at his desk. When he went to CentralAmerica, he would return with photos of women and children livingin terrible conditions.   Even his severest critics credit North with compassion, notinghe played a major role in convincing the administration to pressureEl Salvador to bridle right-wing death squads there.   His emotional commitment to his causes, the long absences fromhis family and his marathon workdays continued to take their toll.Co-workers said he often looked like a ghost in the hallways.Former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane said North brokedown into tears on several occasions when his projects took a badturn.   McFarlane advised North to return to Bethesda for a rest, butthe young colonel wouldn't relent.   North acknowledges some lapses of judgment, including his handin the phony documentation designed to cover up his acceptance of afree security system at his home. But that, he said, was driven byhis concern for family.   And, ``I did not commit any crime'' by misleading Congress aboutthe secret attempts to bolster the Contras, he said on the day hewas indicted in March of last year. ``I can assure you, I willnever give up.''   On that score, nobody doubts that Oliver North was telling thetruth. But his fate may rest ultimately on the shoulders of a manwho takes a kind and gentle view of him.   Asked if North will be remembered as a hero, George Bush saidlast year ``You know, I think Ollie will. And you know why he will?It's not (what) went wrong. He said he made mistakes. I'll say hemade some mistakes. But he believed passionately in something.''</TEXT></DOC>
