More than 40 foreign companies have contracts to exploreand produce oil and gas in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Burma,and all four countries, eager for foreign exchange, haveinvited bidding for additional areas this year. The rapidlygrowing energy needs of Asia's newly industrialized countriesand of the developing nations in Southeast Asia are focusingincreasing attention on these potential new producers.</LP><TEXT>   But balancing the price and the payoff is difficult. Thelogistical problems include rough terrain combined with lackof roads and telecommunications in many areas; thoseshortcomings also mean geological information is scanty insome places. Disputed national claims may cloud the prospectsfor attractive offshore sites. Political uncertainty andfledgling foreign-investment regulations provide furtherhurdles. Even unexploded land mines, the legacy of years ofwar, are a concern.   Vietnam offers the most potential over the next decade.Two U.S. oil companies -- Mobil Corp. and the U.S. affiliateof the Royal/Dutch Shell Group -- made the first oildiscoveries there in 1974, before they had to leave in 1975.Then, in the early 1980s, the Soviet Union did extensiveVietnamese surveys. In the other three countries, explorationbegan only recently. Oil company executives hope that theregion, combined with Thailand, may produce 500,000 to800,000 barrels a day of oil by the end of the century.   &quot;Compared with the Middle East, these areas aren'tsignificant, but regionally {in Asia} they are,&quot; says amanager for a foreign oil-exploration company working inIndochina. &quot;Right now we don't know how much is there. That'swhy foreigners are so interested to invest even with therisks and the cost.&quot;   After years of isolation and war, the governments in theregion have drawn up foreign-investment laws designed toreassure overseas companies. &quot;Oil exploration is veryimportant for us. This is a government priority,&quot; says U PeKyi, director of engineering for Burma's state oil company.   In Vietnam, oil exploration and production have helped thecountry survive the U.S. economic embargo. Oil production isnow nearly 90,000 barrels a day and could double in the nextfive years after offshore drilling begins. Some expertsbelieve Vietnam's oil reserves may be as large as threebillion barrels.   &quot;There will be many opportunities for investment,&quot; says DoVan Ha, director of Vietnam Oil andamp; Gas Corp. &quot;We'd like topromote more exploration in the short term.&quot; Vietnam plans toaward several contracts in the next few months, but the U.S.embargo will prohibit American companies from bidding.   Success in Vietnam gives hope to the other countries,especially Cambodia, which is just opening after 15 years ofbloody civil war. As is the case in Vietnam, Cambodia'soffshore reserves are promising in the near term, in partbecause of the difficulties with onshore exploration. Still,16 foreign groups bid late last year to search for oil andgas within the country and offshore, and four were awardedcontracts. Bidding for 20 additional concessions is now open.   Charles Johnson, a research associate in the EnergyProgram of the East-West Center in Hawaii, estimates thatCambodia may have reserves of 1.5 trillion to 3.5 trillioncubic feet of gas and 50 million to 100 million barrels ofoil. He says Cambodia's production could bring in revenue of$600 million annually by the year 2005.   Laos and Burma are less promising than Vietnam andCambodia in almost every aspect and several foreign companiesaren't willing to spend the money or take the chances now.Laos doesn't produce any oil or gas and oil companies have noidea if it holds significant reserves. And if there is oil inLaos, getting it out of a land-locked country could be aproblem.   A half dozen companies have been exploring in Burma since1988, but only a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell has foundanything. &quot;The results to date have been disappointing andthe costs associated with carrying out onshore operationshave been much higher than budgeted,&quot; says A.D. Melzer,managing director of Britain's Premier Oil Pacific Ltd.,which is exploring in Burma, Cambodia and Thailand.   In fact, Burma is one of the most expensive countries inthe world for exploration, five times higher than neighboringcountries, oil executives say. Burma's political situationalso is discouraging interest, especially among Western oilcompanies. The government is increasingly repressive and itsmilitary action against Muslims in the southwest makesWesterners nervous.   By contrast, in Cambodia the political situation istenuous but improving, with a new peace treaty and a promisedUnited Nations peacekeeping force.   For Asian investors, the proximity of the region seems tooutweigh political problems. Thailand recently announced itsfirst foreign petroleum venture to produce natural gas inBurma and possibly build a pipeline. &quot;We think there are manynew opportunities for cooperation between the countries inthe region,&quot; says Viset Choopiban, acting president of thePetroleum Authority of Thailand's new subsidiary, PTTExploration andamp; Production Co.   Indeed, Thailand's investment in Burma is only one exampleof how Asia is playing a larger role in financing explorationand production in the region. Japan is a leading source ofinvestment, and Indonesia and Malaysia, the region's biggestproducers, are equipped with much-needed expertise.</TEXT></DOC>
