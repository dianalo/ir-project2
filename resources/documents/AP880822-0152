(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis denied allegations Mondayfrom a New York congressman that the Democratic presidentialnominee used college deferments to avoid combat in Korea, saying``I served my country proudly.''   Dukakis attended Swarthmore College from 1951-55, asking for andreceiving deferments in 1952, 1953 and 1954. He said he went to hisdraft board with several weeks of school left and asked to bedrafted immediately.   Dukakis served in the Army for just under two years, including16 months as part of a United Nations contingent assigned to thedemilitarized zone in Korea. The fighting ended in that country inJuly 1953.   ``I served my country, I served my country proudly,'' Dukakistold reporters.   Dukakis pointed out that he could have gotten additionaldeferments by enrolling in law school but asked to be draftedinstead. He was discharged in 1957 and attended Harvard Law Schoolupon his return.   ``I was anxious to do my military service,'' he said.   Rep. Jerry Solomon, R-N.Y., ranking GOP member of the HouseVeterans Affairs Committee, called reporters to point out thedeferments.   ``I just want to point out that Dukakis received his first ofthree educational deferments eight months before the Korean Warended,'' Solomon said in Chicago, where he was to receive an awardfrom the Veterans of Foreign Wars. ``My point is not to pointfingers at Dukakis, because what he did was legal. But he avoidedcombat by using his education deferments. There's nothing wrongwith what he did because it was allowed.   ``The point is the press has made a big thing out of Dan Quaylejoining the National Guard. (But) Dan Quayle stood a chance ofbeing sent into combat,'' while Dukakis didn't, Solomon said. ``Wereally ought to be putting this aside and get on with theseriousness of the campaign. I don't think the campaign should bebogged down in this non-issue.''   Dukakis said his military background was common knowledge and hedismissed Solomon's criticism.   ``I don't think it's a coincidence that a Republican congressmanraised it,'' he said. ``It will be up to the Republican Party toexplain all this.''</TEXT></DOC>
