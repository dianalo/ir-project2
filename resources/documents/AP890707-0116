However, the president coupled his pay-raise plan with a proposalthat the officials justify their right to the higher salaries everythree years to be able to keep receiving them.   Bush's proposal would give full 25 percent hikes to just the mostsenior officials, matching a salary hike he has already advocatedfor federal judges.   More junior officials would get smaller increases, at leastinitially, under the plan.   The president also called for a phaseout of congressionalpeechmaking honoraria over a two-year period and said it should belinked to a pay raise for lawmakers. But he stopped short ofrecommending a specific level.   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush wantedCongress to take the initiative on that politically touchy subjectitself, but that he was ready to work with congressional leaders ona complete package.   The plan would raise the pay of top federal officials, includingCabinet members, to $124,400 from the present $99,500.   It would also raise the salary of Vice President Dan Quayle from$115,000 to $143,000. But it would not affect Bush's $200,000 salary.   The total pay package would cost taxpayers $101 million in thefiscal year that begins next Oct. 1; and $147 million in thefollowing fiscal year, Fitzwater said.   He said the increases would be in addition to a 3.6 percentcost-of-living increase the president is seeking for 2.2 millionfederal workers.   The package would, for the first time, set up a special supercategory for federal employes with special talents, enabling them toget salaries up to the $124,400 top level. Fitzwater said 200individuals would qualify for these special salaries, to bedetermined at a later time.   He suggested that nuclear scientists, physicians or others withspecial talents would be the type of individual considered for thespecial salaries.   The most controversial part of the new package, however, may bethe requirement that all members of the Senior Executive Serviceundergo a re-certification process every three years to keep theirhigher salaries.   The procedure is designed to ``assure that these people performat a level that justifies the higher salary. We do not believe itwould weaken their rights,'' Fitzwater said.   He said the certification would not apply to the government's 700high-level political appointees _ like Cabinet members and othersappointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate _ becausethey ``can be removed at any time without appeal'' by the president.   The 7,200 members of the Senior Executive Service and 700 appointexecutives currently make $68,700 to $80,700. Their pay is tied tothe $89,500 that members of Congress get, and lawmakers' rejectionof a proposed 51 percent congressional pay increase in Februarymeant no raise for them or for judges.   A private commission headed by former Federal Reserve BoardChairman Paul Volker has recommended a 25 percent increaseimmediately followed by a similar amount in 1991, applying tojudges, executive branch officials, members of Congress and otherssuch as top military officers.</TEXT></DOC>
