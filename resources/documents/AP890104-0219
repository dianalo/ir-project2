During Reagan's watch, Soviet-American relations took ona warmth that could not have been anticipated then. Much of LatinAmerica shed its dictators and embraced democracy. The UnitedNations gained in importance. The U.S. government opened talks withthe Palestine Liberation Organization, which the Reaganadministration had labeled an outlaw band of terrorists. And theadministration sold arms to another adversary _ the regime of theayatollah in Iran.   Associated Press reporters who have covered these events sum upthe Reagan impact on world affairs:</TEXT><NOTE>Reagan and the Kremlin: From `Evil Empire' to `Great Confidence'</NOTE><TEXT>   WASHINGTON _ Reagan rewrote the book on dealing with the Kremlin.But if the book has changed, so has Moscow and so has Reagan.   At the outset, Reagan labelled the Soviet Union an ``evilempire'' whose leaders asserted for themselves the ``right to commitany crime, to lie, to cheat, to attain their goal.''   ``So far, detente has been a one-way street that the Soviet Unionhas used to pursue its own aims,'' Reagan said on Jan. 29, 1981.   He backed his rhetoric with a trillion dollar defense buildup.The Soviets cranked up their propaganda machine in response,equating the Reagan administration with Hitler's Third Reich.   After the Soviets walked out of talks to limit intermediate-rangemissiles, Reagan pulled his biggest surprise, in March 1983directing U.S. scientists to devise a shield againstintercontinental ballistic missiles.   The Strategic Defense Initiative reversed an 11-year-old policyand has dominated the arms control debate since then. It is widelycredited with driving the Soviets back to the bargaining table.   At the same time, one generation was giving way to another in theKremlin. Leonid Brezhnev, who was Soviet leader when Reagan tookoffice and under whom the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in December1979 and countenanced the military crackdown against Poland'sSolidarity labor union two years later, died in November 1982.   He was followed in quick succession by two elderly men, YuriAndropov and Konstantin Chernenko, who died in office and gave wayto Mikhail S. Gorbachev in March 1985. Reagan and Gorbachev foundthey could do business.   In December 1987, they signed a treaty that for the first timeeliminated a whole class of new nuclear weapons and created a highlyintrusive system of on-site verification.   The two sides also have made progress on a treaty to sharplyreduce long-range weapons, although differences remain, especiallyover Star Wars.   The changes have been profound enough for Reagan to declare at anews conference concluding the Moscow summit last summer that he had``great confidence'' in Gorbachev's ability to change the SovietUnion.   _By Bryan Brumley</TEXT><NOTE>The Mideast: Deals with the Ayatollah and Arafat</NOTE><TEXT>   WASHINGTON _ Israel considered Reagan its best friend in theWhite House since President Harry S. Truman supported establishmentof the Jewish state 40 years ago. But in his last weeks, Reagan andSecretary of State George P. Shultz authorized talks with the PLO.It was a shocking turn of events bound to open a new chapter in theMideast's history.   The decision, based on statements made by PLO Chairman YasserArafat renouncing terrorism and saying a Palestinian state wouldlive alongside Israel, dismayed Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir andwas denounced by the Jerusalem government. Still, the criticism wasmuted, while American Jewish leaders also held their fire. This waslargely due to the trust Reagan and Shultz had built up.   Peace plans advanced _ unsuccessfully _ by Reagan and Shultz didnot provide for an independent Palestinian state nor call on Israelto relinquish all of the West Bank and Gaza.   U.S. criticism of the spread of Jewish outposts in theterritories was muted and a U.N. resolution condemning them asillegal and an obstruction to peace was vetoed by the United States.   The strenuous American campaign against terrorism led by Shultzcemented ties with Israel, a target of extremists. American jetsbombed Tripoli, the capital of Libya, and Shultz denied a visa toArafat to speak at the United Nations in New York.   Ironically, only a few weeks later, Shultz approved a``substantive dialogue'' with the PLO, which enhanced Arafat'sprestige and was received with jubilation in the Arab world.   In another curious twist, the Untied States and Israel secretlyprovided arms to Iran despite Iran's presence on the StateDepartment's list of countries that support terrorism. The purposewas to encourage moderation in Tehran and to secure the release ofAmerican hostages. Nine remain in captivity as Reagan leaves office.   In 1982, when Israeli troops and tanks rolled into Lebanon in acampaign to wipe out the PLO, the Reagan administration organized adiplomatic effort to stop the invasion short of Beirut anddispatched U.S. Marines to protect the PLO as it evacuated thecountry.   Lebanese Christians massacred Palestinians that September inrefugee camps south of Beirut, bringing U.S. Marines back to lowertensions. This mission ended in disaster. Terrorists blew up theU.S. embassy in April 1983 and bombed the Marines' headquarters inOctober, killing 241 servicemen.   In 1983, Shultz worked out an agreement for Israel to withdrawits troops while Lebanon moved toward recognition of the Jewishstate. Syria and Saudi Arabia persuaded Lebanon to abandon theaccord.   In the meantime, Reagan's plan for peace talks between Israel andthe Arabs did not get off the ground when it was rejected byMenachem Begin, then Israel's prime minister, in 1982.   Shultz tried a similar version of ``land-for-peace'' in 1988, butit was not accepted by Israel, Jordan and Palestinians.   A tougher test of the U.S.-Iraelirelationship began with risingviolence by Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza a yearago and the establishment of a U.S. dialogue with the PLO _ a matternow put in George Bush's hands.   _By Barry Schweid</TEXT><NOTE>Suddenly, the United Nations Is Back in Fashion</NOTE><TEXT>   UNITED NATIONS _ It wasn't Ronald Reagan's doing, but the UnitedNations began to play an important role in world affairs. Itspeacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize and some member stateseven started paying back dues.   Reagan had been critical of the world organization for sevenyears, but in October, addressing the 159 nations of the GeneralAssembly for the last time, he conceded: ``Yes, the United Nationsis a better place today. But so, too, is the world.''   The United Nations has played or is playing a major role inmolding peace agreements, peace talks or peace prospects inAfghanistan, the Iran-Iraq war, Southern Africa and Namibia,Cambodia and the Western Sahara.   The United States, the biggest U.N. donor, feels it has proddedthe world body into cutting costs. Washington saw an anti-Americanbias, overspending, overstaffing, bureaucracy and waste andcomplained that poor, developing nations hostile to the Westcontributed little but dictated how U.S. funds would be spent ofsquandered.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
