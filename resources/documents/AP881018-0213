The one-day walkout was to support demands for an increase inthe minimum monthly wage from $758 to $968. The confederation alsois asking for protection of purchasing power, more employment,better working conditions and retirement protection.   Tuesday's strike hit hardest public transportation, the postalservice and the state-run electricity company. But it is only aforetaste of more widespread strikes scheduled for Thursday by theother unions representing public employees.   Michel Durafour, the civil service minister, has refused toconsider any new pay increases for 1988. Talks between thegovernment and the unions on 1989 salaries are to begin soon.   Also joining the strike were employees at French diplomaticposts around the world, where staff are fighting a series of cutsin their cost-of-living allowments.   It coincided with a nationwide strike by France's nurses andhospital employees who demand higher wages. The nurses want $325 amonth more. The government has offered about $105, depending onexperience and seniority.   President Francois Mitterrand, on a visit to Normandy, told agroup of nurses that they were asking ``much too much,'' saying thegovernment of Premier Michel Rocard already had ``given a lot.''   The workers' demonstration in Paris turned out 100,000 people,according to the union. Police estimated the crowd at 15,000 to20,000. About 5,000 marched in Lyon, Bordeaux and Marseille, eachand smaller demonstrations were held in other cities.   The Paris subway ran at about 50 percent to 70 percent of itsnormal service Tuesday, while service was normal in Lyon andMarseille. Long distrance rail lines were practically normal inmost parts of the country, except for the west, where a third ofthe scheduled trains did not run.   Hardest hit was the state-run electric company. Sporadic powercuts hit nearly all areas. The postal service also was heavilyaffected. Strikes in main sorting centers spelled delays of mailfor the next several days.</TEXT></DOC>
