In Washington, a government source said the Bush administrationhad succeeded in communicating with Iran, which is believed to havestrong influence over groups holding hostages.   Algeria assumed a leading role in efforts to win release of thecaptives.   The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella forfactions holding hostages, named five prisoners held in Israel thatit wants released, in addition to a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnappedby Israel.   The statement indirectly endorsed demands made Thursday by theRevolutionary Justice Organization after it suspended threats tokill American hostage Joseph Cicippio.   Israel said it was exploring all ways of winning freedom forhostages but would not engage in ``public debate'' on the demands.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted anunidentified Foreign Ministry official as saying: ``The U.S.administration sent a message to Iran's Foreign Ministry last weekthrough a third country. Since the content had nothing to do withIran, the message was not accepted.''   Iran has denied involvement in hostage-taking.   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the official wasresponding to reports that Bush sent a message to Iran to preventthe killing of hostages. It gave no further details.   A closely involved source in Washington said on condition ofanonymity, ``Basically, we've been trying to get different peopleto weigh in.''   ``We have been able to get our messages, one way or another,through to the parties _ certainly to the Iranians,'' the sourcesaid.   Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, on Friday offered tohelp solve the hostage problem.   However, he said the United States must pressure Israel to freeSheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem clergyman abducted July 28from south Lebanon.   On Monday, a pro-Iranian group said it hanged an Americanhostage, Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, in retaliation forIsrael's refusal to free Obeid. Revolutionary Justice thenthreatened to kill Cicippio but said Thursday it was ``freezing''the order while demanding freedom for Obeid and Palestinian andLebanese prisoners in Israel.   Israel has accused Obeid of instigating attacks on Israel andhas offered to free him only if the foreign hostages and threeIsraeli soldiers held in Lebanon are freed.   In Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's top aide, YossiAhimeir, said Israel's original offer stands and that the countryrefuses to ``engage in a public debate'' over Hezbollah demands.   ``We are holding contacts and making efforts to bring about therelease of hostages and prisoners and it's not worthwhile to addany details now,'' he said.   There are 16 foreigners, including eight Americans, held inLebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March16, 1985.   In Damascus, Syria, the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations,Marrack Goulding, told a news conference there was ``optimism inthe air'' in Beirut about the release of hostages.   But he warned there would be no ``quick fixes, no simplesolution.''   Goulding arrived in Syria from Lebanon, where he wasinvestigating the killing of Higgins, who was working with a U.N.observer force when he was abducted in February 1988.   After three days of discussions in Beirut, Goulding said he hadnot yet ``obtained concrete proof that Colonel Higgins is dead, andI pray he is not dead.''   U.S. officials have said they are virtually certain Higgins isdead.   Goulding also told reporters: ``Algeria is playing an extra partin trying to resolve the hostage problem as Algeria has done inprevious cases.''   The North African country, which has strong ties to both theWest and radical Moslem groups, has successfully mediated hostagecrises in the past 10 years. Algerian diplomats helped win therelease of American hostages in January 1981 after they were held444 days at the U.S. Embassy in Iran.   Algeria's ambassador to Beirut, Khaled Hasnawi, was quotedSaturday by Beirut radio stations as saying his country wasundertaking a new initiative to free all hostages.   Radio Algiers said his talks involved all hostages, whether``Lebanese, Palestinians, Americans, Europeans or Israelis.'' Itcited ``progress in this mediation.''   Several Beirut radio stations said Bush had specifically askedAlgeria to intercede.   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut on Saturday demandedfreedom from Israeli prisons of five ``uprising heroes,''identified as Nidal Zaloum, Itaf Alyan and Abdul-Hadi SuleimanGhanem and ``Lebanese resistance heroes'' Anwar Yaseen and SohaBishara.   It also demanded Israel release Obeid, Palestinians jailedduring the anti-Israeli uprising in the occupied territories, andguerrillas it has captured.</TEXT></DOC>
