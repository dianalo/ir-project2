Cicippio's wife pleaded with his captors to spare his lifetoday, a day after kidnappers said they hanged a U.S. Marinebecause of the cleric's abduction.   The Revolutionary Justice Organization announced the reprieve ina 13-line handwritten statement in Arabic delivered to theindependent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar at 8:15 p.m. (1:15 EDT).   It was more than two hours after the original deadline set bythe extremists in a statement Monday for a verdict on Cicippio. Thestatement was accompanied by an authenticating snapshot of anotherU.S. hostage, author Edward Austin Tracy, also held by the group.   Also today, a deadline set by kidnappers for a British hostage,Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, passed with no immediate wordfrom his captors.   The reported hanging of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins andthe threat today against Cicippio presented President Bush with hisfirst major hostage crisis.   The United Nations said its top peacekeeping official, MarrackGoulding, left for the Lebanese capital to try to recover Higgins'sbody. He is expected to arrive Wednesday.   Cicippio's wife, Ilham, tearfully pleaded with his captors today.   ``Please don't execute him, please,'' she said at a newsconference at the press center in east Beirut's Jedeideh area.   She read out a message to her husband: ``Joe, I know thedifficulty of the situation in which we are but all I ask you is tokeep your hopes high.''   On Monday, the pro-Iranian Shiite group that abducted Higgins,the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, released a videotape ofa man they said was Higgins dangling from a gallows.   Higgins commanded a group of U.N. truce observers in southLebanon when he was seized Feb. 17, 1988.   The Revolutionary Justice Organization had issued a statementMonday saying it would announce the hour of Cicippio's``execution'' if Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid was not freed by 6 p.m.today (11 a.m. EDT). The reprieve announced later today apparentlyextends the deadline to 6 p.m. Thursday.   Israel has refused to release Obeid and two companions capturedwith him. Jerusalem has said it would swap him and other ShiiteMoslem prisoners for three Israeli soldiers and other foreignersheld hostage in Lebanon.   Today, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah rejected the offer and saidIsrael and the United States were responsible for any retaliationagainst Western hostages taken by Islamic groups.   ``The only acceptable thing to us is that Sheik Abdul KarimObeid and his two colleagues be released,'' said a statement byHezbollah, or Party of God.   The cleric is a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, the organizationbelieved to be an umbrella group for the kidnappers of Higgins andthe 16 other Westerners missing in Lebanon. Eight of the 16 areAmericans.   Cicippio, 58, of Norristown, Pa., was acting comptroller at theAmerican University of Beirut when he was kidnapped on the campuson Sept. 12, 1986. Mrs. Cicippio, 34, works at the American Embassyin east Beirut and lives on the campus.   The photograph released today of Tracy, 58, showed thesilver-haired Burlington, Vermont man from the waist up, sporting abushy white beard and wearing a navy blue tracksuit. It was thefirst picture of him released by the captors since March 8. Tracydisappeared in October 1986.   This morning, an anonymous caller claiming to speak forOppressed on Earth said in a call to a Beirut radio station thatWaite would be killed by midnight (5 p.m. EDT) unless Israel freesObeid.   There was no way to determine the authenticity of the threat,made to the Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation.   In Nicosia, Cyprus, an anonymous caller claiming to speak forthe group told The Associated Press on Monday that the group wouldkill Waite at 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT) today, but the deadline passedwith no immediate word from the captors.   It could not be immediately verified if that caller was from theorganization, which had not made previous calls to the AP office inCyprus.   Waite, 50, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking the releaseof foreign hostages after leaving his west Beirut hotel tonegotiate with Islamic Jihad. He is believed held by Islamic Jihad,though no group has claimed responsibility.   Higgins' reported hanging was clouded by doubt because ofprevious reports he may have been killed months ago, and Lebanesepolice said they could not confirm the claimed Higgins killing onMonday. Nevertheless, the claim and the videotape that accompaniedit met with revulsion worldwide.   Bush condemned the reported killing of the U.S. Marine andcalled on ``all parties'' holding hostages in the Middle East torelease them. He cut short a two-day Western trip and met with topadvisers in Washington, and an administration source said officialswere considering how to respond.   The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidmilitary action has not been ruled out.   Bush briefed congressional leaders Monday night, and one of thelawmakers said the White House made clear the United States hadbeen kept in the dark about Israel's plan to kidnap Obeid.   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today suggestedIsrael was conducting negotiations with Shiite groups to obtain therelease of Israeli prisoners and Western hostages.   Asked whether Israeli was engaged in contacts with Shiite groupsin Lebanon, Shamir told reporters ``there are permanent contactswith various factors about the release of the hostages.''   Israeli sources said the decision to abduct Obeid had triggereddeep divisions in the government. Shamir defended the abduction,saying it was made to help free Israeli and Western hostages inLebanon.   In Iran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said before thereported hanging that his country condemns ``any kind of kidnappingor death threat.''   Israeli fighter jets swooped over strongholds of the Shiitefundamentalists in Lebanon at daybreak today, drawing gunfire fromHezbollah militiamen in the ancient town of Baalbek, police said.   A police spokesman said no hits were scored and the planes didnot attempt to bomb east Lebanon's Bekaa valley, where more than4,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards attached to Hezbollah are based.   In West Germany today, a spokesman for federal prosecutors saidthe captors of two West Germans have demanded the release ofconvicted hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi and his brother, Abbas.   The spokesman in Karlsruhe, Hans-Juergen Foerster, said thedemands were relayed to the West German Embassy in Beirut, but hedid not indicate when or how. A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Bonnrefused comment on Foerster's report.   No one has claimed responsibility for kidnapping Thomas Kemptnerand Heinrich Struebig, who were abducted May 16.   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for the AP, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
