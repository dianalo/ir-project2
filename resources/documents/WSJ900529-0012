In the mercurial bond market, the employment report hasbecome a potent economic indicator with the power toinstantly turn bond-market sentiment upside down.</LP><TEXT>   This week, the employment report for May will be even morecrucial in helping to shape investors' perceptions about theeconomy's strength. Analysts will be looking carefully at thereport to see if the extremely weak employment numbers inMarch and April were aberrations, or confirmation that theeconomy is sluggish.   &quot;A weak employment report is the only thing that can getthe bond-market rally up and going again,&quot; said Sung WonSohn, a senior vice president at Norwest Corp.   Immediately after the April employment report was releasedon May 4, bond-market sentiment suddenly shifted from bearishto bullish because the jobs data suggested that the economywas much weaker than previous economic reports had indicated.   In response to the report, prices of the Treasury'sbenchmark 30-year bond jumped 1 1/2 points, or $15 for a bondwith a $1,000 face amount. Since then, yields on long-termand intermediate-term bonds have fallen one-third of apercentage point to about 8.7%, paving the way for lowermortgage and other consumer lending rates.   Another weak report for May would reinforce perceptionsthat business activity is winding down and that eventually,although not right away, the Federal Reserve may pushinterest rates lower in an effort to stimulate economicgrowth.   But many economists believe a moderate or strong reportcould create confusion and uncertainty, prompting bond yieldsto remain at current levels or even rise somewhat. Susan M.Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., said strongemployment growth could keep &quot;the 30-year Treasury yieldtrapped in its recent trading range above 8.50%.&quot;   Mr. Sohn is more wary. He said a strong employment report-- one that shows job gains in excess of 150,000 -- wouldcause bond-market investors to focus on negative technicalfactors and lead to widespread bearish sentiment.   High on the list of negative technicals is the huge amountof new bills, notes and bonds the Treasury must sell tofinance the thrift-industry bailout. Last week, Treasuryofficials admitted that the cost of the bailout is soaringand that the government may have to spend $300 billion overthe next 10 years to clean up the industry.   The Treasury will have to borrow massive amounts of moneyto finance the bailout, and that could put upward pressure oninterest rates.   In addition, Japanese investors, who tend to buy largeamounts of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, have sharplyreduced their purchases in recent months.   &quot;The Japanese are not all that wild about participating inthe U.S. market; they have become reluctant buyers,&quot; said Mr.Sohn. He said that Japanese institutions are searching forinvestment opportunities in their own stock and bond markets,which were severely depressed earlier this year.   Those markets are now recovering, in part because thevalue of the yen is rising and long-term interest rates inJapan appear to be heading lower. Last week, for example,Japan's major long-term credit banks lowered their primelending rate to 7.6% from 7.9%. The yield on Japan'sbenchmark 10-year government bond, which peaked at 7.3% inmid-March, was quoted at 6.9% on Friday.   &quot;Clearly, things have turned around for the Japanese,&quot;said Brian Fabbri, economist at Midland Montagu SecuritiesInc. &quot;This is taking some of the steam out of our market,&quot; hesaid. The only way to revive the U.S. bond market rally, hesaid, &quot;is another piece of weak employment data.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Bond prices were unchanged to lower in quiet pre-holidaytrading. Most investment banks and commercial banks closedtheir bond trading operations at 2 p.m. EDT on Friday andwere closed yesterday in observance of Memorial Day.   On Friday, a report indicating that consumer spendingadvanced at a steady 0.6% clip during April pushed prices oflongterm Treasury bonds lower.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/8 point, aloss of $6.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The priceof the benchmark bond ended at 100 25/32 to yield 8.66%, downfrom Thursday's price of 101 13/32 to yield 8.81%.   Short-term rates jumped. The discount rate on three-monthTreasury bills ended at 7.75%, for a bond-equivalent yield of7.99%. That was down from a rate of 7.68%, for a bondequivalent yield of 7.92%. The rate on six-month bills fellto 7.75% to yield 8.16%, compared with 7.71% to yield 8.11%on Thursday.   In the junk-bond market, most prices ended unchanged. Themajor exceptions were the bonds of R.H. Macy andamp; Co., whichgyrated wildly.   The bonds, which fell a total of six points on Wednesdayand Thursday, staged a partial rebound on Friday due toMacy's release of better-than-expected third-quarterfinancial results.   The New York-based retailer said its cash flow -- orearnings before interest, taxes and depreciation -- increasedin the third quarter to $160.2 million from $154 million inthe year-ago period, based on preliminary results.   The company's loss, after interest, taxes anddepreciation, in the period ended April 28, totaled $63.1million, a slight improvement over last year's $64.1 millionloss. Sales in the third quarter were $1.486 billion, almostunchanged from $1.482 billion a year ago.   &quot;These are very positive results for Macy's,&quot; said AndrewLeinoff, a high-yield analyst who covers the retail industryat McCarthy Crisanti andamp; Maffei Inc. &quot;What it means is that themargins are a little better than last year, and the companyhas recovered, as it stated, from its dismal performance atChristmas.&quot;   Macy's 14.5% subordinated debentures maturing in 2001finished at a bid price of 60, up two points from lateThursday. Macy's 14.5% senior subordinated debentures due in1998 also finished up two points at 69, while its zero-couponbonds gained two points to end at 26.   Despite these gains, Macy bonds have yet to recover fullyfrom the rout that took place earlier in the week. News thatHeller Financial Corp., a major factoring agent, shifted froma &quot;revolving credit&quot; policy toward Macy suppliers to an&quot;order-by-order&quot; policy triggered the declines.   In the tax-exempt market, municipal bonds ended 1/8 to 1/4point lower. Despite the declines, traders said the marketmanaged to digest more than $1.6 billion in new debt that wasissued last week.</TEXT></DOC>
