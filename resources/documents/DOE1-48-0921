<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-0921 </DOCNO><TEXT>The semiclassical prescription for calculating nucleon-nucleon scatteringamplitudes in the Skyrme model is reviewed. It is argued that the lackof an intermediate-range attraction in the nucleon-nucleon potentialderived from the Skyrme model is an artifact of the ad hoc prescriptionfor the potential and will not affect the scattering amplitudes. Thecalculation of scattering amplitudes is illustrated by calculating thecontribution to the amplitudes for 90{sup 0} scattering from novel classicalsolutions conjectured by Manton.</TEXT></DOC>
