KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The State Department, reporting on the eve ofthe U.S.-Soviet meeting, said Tuesday there have been significanthuman rights improvements inside the Soviet Union under PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev.   But the department also said those improvements have been unevenand marked by reversals and inconsistencies, and Moscow remains inviolation of the human rights provisions of the Helsinki accord, inpart because of its continuing occupation of Afghanistan.   Moscow committed itself to withdrawing from Afghanistan by Feb.15, but the Soviets announced a suspension last month, complainingabout attacks on the Red Army by U.S.-armed Afghan guerrillas.   The report also said the Soviets ``continue to undermine thebasic principles'' of the Helsinki agreement on relations betweennations by supporting the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.   The conclusions were contained in the State Department'ssemiannual report to Congress on implementation of the Helsinkiagreement, which involves 33 European nations, the United States andCanada. The accord was aimed at promoting cooperation among thenations and the protection of human rights.   The report was issued one day before Gorbachev meets withPresident Reagan rovedconsiderably'' in 1988 and cited increases in emigration, therelease of some, but not all, political prisoners and reform of thepractice of committing political offenders to mental hospitals.   ``There were reports of fewer beatings in psychiatrichospitals,'' the report said. ``Dissidents reported that thepunitive use of drugs continued, however, and compiled a list of 90individuals known to have been in psychiatric hospitals at one timeand whose whereabouts are unknown today.''   The report said unofficial groups and publications ``continued toflourish although some activities were subjected to harsh pressattacks.''   A July 28 decree by the Supreme Soviet on demonstrations had amixed impact, the report said, permitting some large demonstrationswhile forbidding others.   The report said that some of the more than 30,000 unofficialgroups formed since Gorbachev began to implement his new policiesare ``political parties in all but name'' and said two of them havepublicly declared themselves to be ``opposition political parties.''   ``On the whole, Soviet authorities were tolerant of these groups,although they endeavored to channel their activities,'' the reportsaid.   But it said the changes have not yet been made permanent throughthe adoption of appropriate legislation and regulations ``toguarantee respect for individual rights.''   ``Although the diminishing numbers of political prisonerssignaled positive progress,'' the report said, ``the lack of legalprotection of individual rights continued to permit the arbitraryuse of power by Soviet authorities.''   It said that although the numbers of political prisoners have``fallen substantially'' to an estimated 100 to 200, conditions inlabor camps continued to be ``deplorable.''   The report said recently released prisoners cited ``inadequatediet, poor or no medical treatment, beatings, repeated sentences inpunishment cells and few or no family visits or correspondence.''   However, it noted that on July 25 the Soviet Presidium struckfrom the criminal code a provision mandating reduced rations forprisoners in punishment and isolation cells.   On the subject of religious activity, the report said that``while there have been positive developments, freedom to professone's religion remains severely restricted in the Soviet Union.''</TEXT></DOC>
