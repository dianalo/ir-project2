Of the banks shut yesterday, five banks are to reopen today as branches of other institutions. They are Montgomery County Bank, The Woodlands, Texas; Farmers National Bank of Remington, Remington, Ind.; Bear Creek National Bank, Bear Creek, Texas; Peoples Bank andamp; Trust Co., Holdenville, Okla.; and LaPryor State Bank, LaPryor, Texas.    The FDIC will pay off the insured deposits of the sixth, First State Bank of Pattonsburg, Pattonsburg, Mo., because no bids were received for its purchase.    Montgomery County's sole office is to reopen as a branch of Texas Commerce Bank, Houston. Montgomery County had assets of $45.4 million and held deposits of $44.3 million in 9,700 accounts.    The three offices of Farmers National are to become branches of Lafayette National Bank, Lafayette, Ind. Farmers National's assets totaled $34.6 million, and it held $33.6 million in 5,500 deposit accounts.    Jersey Village Bank, Houston, is to reopen the two offices of Bear Creek National as branches. The failed bank had assets of $26.2 million and held $25.6 million in 5,500 deposit accounts.    The sole office of Peoples is to reopen as a branch of The Bank, McAllister, Okla. Peoples had assets of $20.2 million and held deposits of $19.3 million in 2,700 accounts.    LaPryor State's office is to reopen as a branch of Zavala County Bank, Crystal City, Texas. LaPryor State had assets of $5.4 million and held deposits of $5 million in 1,400 accounts.    The FDIC will begin paying off the insured deposits of First State on Monday. Officials believe that all of the $5.5 million the failed Pattonsburg bank held in 1,700 deposit accounts falls below the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000. </TEXT></DOC>
