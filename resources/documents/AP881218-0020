But they did it, despite a lack of places to grip and a toughoverhang.   Officials at the $26 million African tropical forest exhibit saidthey wanted to establish that the zoo's gorillas would be unable toreach the peak of the cliffs and thereby gain access to the publicarea of the innovative animal display.   ``The gorilla has shorter legs and longer arms and he's muchstronger,'' said project manager Walter Kilroy of the MetropolitanDistrict Commission, which operates the zoo.   ``This is a fairly strong test of the rocks,'' he added,``because gorillas can't really problem-solve the way humans can.''   Climber Richard Doucette said he had had a tough time reachingthe exhibit summit. ``The rocks lack features (places to grip) andthe overhang is what kills you,'' he said.   Zoo officials said some niches would be filled in to preventclimbers _ human and primate _ from gaining a grip.   The exhibit, scheduled to open in September 1989, was designed toportray animals in their environment rather than in cages, ExecutiveDirector Mark Goldstein said.   ``You and I grew up with zoos where the elephants were in onecage and the lions were in the next cage. We learned about animalsin these cubby holes,'' he said. ``But instead of this being aspecies building or a Noah's Ark, you will be experiencing a pieceof an African forest.''   In addition to gorillas, the state-funded complex includes plentyof tropical vegetation, streams and waterfalls, 25 species of birds,fish, leopards, insects, crocodiles and antelope.</TEXT></DOC>
