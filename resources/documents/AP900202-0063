The ANC, which has exile headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, waslegalized today by President F.W. de Klerk in a move that instantlychanged the country's political scene.   The most powerful black group opposing the white-led governmentand its apartheid policies, the ANC has an estimated 15,000 membersin exile and millions of black supporters in South Africa. Mostobservers believe it would win elections if the 28-million blackmajority were allowed to vote. Virtually all leading anti-apartheidgroups in South Africa support the ANC.   Its leadership is made up mostly of older, well-educated mensuch as the imprisoned Nelson Mandela, 71, and Oliver Tambo, theANC's 71-year-old president, who is recovering in Sweden from astroke.   De Klerk said today that Mandela, the country's best-known blackleader, will be freed shortly after more than 27 years in prison.He is serving a life sentence for launching the ANC's guerrillacampaign.   Despite its aging leadership, the ANC's support is strongestamong South Africa's black youths, many of whom who received theirpolitical education in repeated street clashes with the securityforces.   Most of the ANC's young backers are ardent supporters of thearmed struggle. Until today, the organization had said itsguerrilla campaign remained an important part of struggle to obtainblack political rights, but de Klerk's announcements may prompt itto suspend violence.   The armed struggle has slackened considerably in the past twoyears and poses no serious threat to the South African government.   ``Looking at our situation realistically, we must admit that wedo not have the capacity within our country to intensify the(armed) struggle in any meaningful way,'' ANC secretary-generalAlfred Nzo said last month.   Even prior to de Klerk's speech today at the opening ofParliament, the ANC appeared to be thrown off balance by thepresident's reforms. Its emphasis on the armed struggle andbuilding support for sanctions against South Africa were generatinglittle enthusiasm. Now, such policies are even less likely to winsupport.   The ANC says it wants a one-person, one-vote democracy in SouthAfrica, a system de Klerk opposes, saying it will lead to blackdomination of the 5 million whites.   The ANC also says it envisions a mixed economy in South Africa,though it has a strong ideological preference for socialism.   The ANC, founded in 1912, peacefully opposed the South Africangovernment until it was banned in 1960. A year later, Mandelalaunched its guerrilla campaign and most of the leadership waseither arrested or went into exile.   Seven senior leaders, including 77-year-old Walter Sisulu, werereleased last October and have been campaigning openly on behalf ofthe ANC.   They continue to support the ANC's alliance with the SouthAfrican Communist Party, another banned group that de Klerklegalized today. The membership of the two organizations overlap,and about half of the ANC's top 35 leaders are believed to bemembers of the Communist Party.   De Klerk also legalized the Pan Africanist Congress, a smallerblack group that wages a sporadic guerrilla campaign. The PanAfricanist Congress split from the ANC in 1959 over the question ofwhite participation in the black political struggle.   The ANC has some white members and believes in a multiracialquest for black political rights, while the Pan Africanist Congressbelieves blacks should be completely self-reliant.</TEXT></DOC>
