ZimmermanandM;Compaq Computer Corp. and Novell Inc. will team up this week to demonstratethe latest version of Novell's System Fault Tolerant Level III NetWare.andM;Four closed briefings at NetWorld in Dallas will give some of Compaq's majorcorporate accounts the chance to see Novell's SFT Level III running on aSystempro, according to sources close to both firms.andM;SFT Level III, which Novell has been developing on and off for at least fiveyears, provides mirroring between two servers.andP;  If a primary server fails,applications are automatically rerouted to a second server, thus eliminatingdowntime.andP;  Once the primary server is repaired, it is automaticallyresynchronized and takes back its role.andP;  SFT Level III has been under firefor its lengthy delay to market, but some analysts feel the criticism isunwarranted.andM;&quot;A lot of other things have been going on at Novell, and they've put SFT onhold a number of times, that's all,&quot; said Craig Burton, CEO and principalanalyst of Clarke Burton Corp., a network consulting and publishing firm inSalt Lake City.andP;  &quot;Out of those five years, they've probably worked on it atotal of a year and a half.&quot;andM;Nevertheless, SFT is not without its share of problems.andP;  At Novell's annualDevelopers' Conference last March, a demonstration of SFT Level III runningon two Compaq Systempros failed, said sources who attended the event.andM;In a second demonstration, made later the same day on what appeared to be twoenhanced Systempros, the software worked, the sources said.andM;Several sources who were present at the March demonstration surmised that theproblem had to do with Systempro's ROM BIOS, while others said the fault laywith the Novell drivers inside the server.andM;&quot;The problem could've been any number of things,&quot; said Burton.andP;  &quot;But onething to understand is that SFT is not going to be hardware-specific.&quot;andM;Users are willing to wait for SFT.andP;  &quot;We have lots of data we want to mirror,&quot;said a source close to Novell.andP;  &quot;SFT will give us the type of redundancy thatour plant requires.andP;  It's either that or go out and buy a lot more harddrives.&quot;andM;Running SFT Level III requires the software on both servers, a high-speedSmall Computer System Interface (SCSI) board in each server and drivers torun the boards, said Burton.andP;  No other details were available regarding whattype of Systempro Compaq will use for the demonstration or when SFT Level IIImight be released, according to the sources.andM;Compaq officials in Houston and Novell officials in Provo, Utah, declined tocomment on the briefings.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
