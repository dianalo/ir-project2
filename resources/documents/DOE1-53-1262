The equations can be solved to derive the response to polarizedor unpolarized radiation, as well as the characteristics of the light-inducedmacroscopic anisotropy. It is concluded that the kinetics under photoselectionconditions may differ substantially from the case of rapid rotationaldiffusion.</TEXT></DOC>
