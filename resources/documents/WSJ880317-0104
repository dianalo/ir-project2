CNW, the parent company for the Chicago andamp; North Western Transportation Co., said it advised the National Mediation Board in Washington that it will accept arbitration in its negotiations with the trainmen's union. The board has been unsuccessfully attempting to settle the dispute over crew size since last August and has asked both sides to go into arbitration proceedings.    A CNW spokesman said the company's offer is conditioned on the union accepting ground rules for arbitration by tomorrow. He said the company proposed the rules late Tuesday.    Under federal railway labor law, if either side rejects arbitration, that will trigger a 30-day standstill period after which CNW can cut crew size on its own and the union can strike in retaliation.    A union spokesman couldn't be reached for comment late yesterday.    CNW wants to cut the size of crews on its freight trains to two trainmen from four. The company says technology has reduced the workload for the train crews, and that it can save $55 million annually if it can make the cuts. The union says it wants various changes in work rules that the company says will cost $5 million annually.    The issue of crew size has been a critical dispute between management and labor on railroads across the country for years. But most railroads are locked into contracts signed in the late 1970s that bar them from changing crew size until all the crews at the time of the signing are retired. CNW is the only major railroad that doesn't have such an agreement.    In a separate matter, CNW said the U.S. District Court in Chicago yesterday granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting a strike by the company's rail unions over CNW's plan to sell 208 miles of its line in Wisconsin to Chicago-based Itel Corp.    The court also rejected a motion by union representatives for a preliminary injunction to halt the sale.    Itel has said it plans to alter existing work rules and cut salaries for employees who work on the line. The unions are demanding that CNW bargain with them for severance provisions before the track is sold. About 230 CNW union employees would be affected.    CNW said the sale would be held up until an appellate court acts on the union's motion for an expedited hearing of an appeal. If the hearing is granted, the company said it wouldn't complete the sale until a decision in the case. </TEXT></DOC>
