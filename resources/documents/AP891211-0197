They were the first Vietnamese boat people to be repatriatedagainst their will by Hong Kong. Some screamed for help as theywere taken from camp.   Government-funded Radio Television Hong Kong reported the CathayPacific Tri-star landed at the Vietnamese capital without incident.It quoted an unidentified Vietnamese Foreign Ministry official assaying thousands more Vietnamese living in refugee camps in HongKong will be returned home within weeks.   About 56,000 Vietnamese who arrived in Hong Kong by boat areheld in squalid camps. Nearly 44,000 are considered illegalimmigrants and are to be sent home unless they can provepersecution awaits them.   The Tri-star left this British colony at 5:09 a.m., two hoursafter riot police entered a detention center, removed theVietnamese and took them to the the airport under tight securityand cover of darkness.   Put on the plane were eight Vietnamese men, 17 women and 26children, a government spokeswoman said, insisting on anonymity.``Repatriation has taken place. Everything went smoothly.''   In London, the international human rights group AmnestyInternational condemned the repatriation and appealed to PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher and the governor of Hong Kong to halt it.   The British Foreign Office early Tuesday would said only thatthe first involuntary repatriations passed off without difficulty.Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd is to make a statement on the issuein the Commons later Tuesday.   On Monday, visiting U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIrepeated U.S. reservations about the repatriations during a meetingwith Mrs. Thatcher at her official 10 Downing St. residence.   Some Vietnamese shrieked for help from windows of the detentioncamp as the operation began at 3 a.m. Others held signs through themetal bars that said: ``Where is your humanity?''   Police equipped with helmets, shields, revolvers and batonsquickly pulled them away.   ``I don't want to go back to Vietnam!'' a woman shouted inbroken Cantonese, the dialect of Hong Kong, waving her hands indespair.   A convoy of police vans took the Vietnamese from the PhoenixHouse detention center to the airport. Some boat people cried asthey were taken away; others waved at reporters.   About 175 police and corrections officers were involved,outnumbering the Vietnamese at least 3-1. Reporters saw no evidenceof violence.   What appeared to be the same vans later pulled up to the jet onthe airport tarmac, but reporters watching from the roof of anearby building could not see people boarding.   The United States argues that conditions first must improveinside the Communist country before there is repatriation.   Britain claims the program is necessary to deter more boatpeople from fleeing to overcrowded Hong Kong, about 600 milesnortheast of Hanoi.   On Monday, Radio Television Hong Kong quoted a Vietnameseofficial as saying Hanoi would insist force not be used and wouldaccept only those who did not resist repatriation.   According to the radio report, Vietnam agreed more people mustbe repatriated than the 636 who returned voluntarily. It quoted theofficial as saying those returning would not be punished.   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees monitors the boat peoplewho have returned voluntarily but has refused to take part in theforced repatriation.   So far, nearly 6,800 Vietnamese screened by Hong Kongimmigration officials have been rejected as refugees. In 1988, HongKong decided to treat arriving boat people as illegal immigrants asa means of stopping the mass influx.   Hong Kong officials said the Vietnamese were arriving muchfaster than they could be resettled overseas and most were fleeingpoverty, not persecution.   Boat people continued to arrive, more than 34,000 from Jan. 1 toNov. 10. Officials say it is important to begin the involuntaryrepatriation before the next sailing season in the spring.   Opponents of forced repatriation argued it could triggerviolence in the detention centers and lead some to try suicide.   The Hong Kong government spokeswoman said that as of earlyTuesday she had received no reports of trouble at the camps.</TEXT></DOC>
