The failed bank, which had total assets of $173.1 million, was closed yesterday by state banking authorities and the FDIC was named receiver. The new Union Bank will assume $167.5 million in 26,000 deposit accounts and will purchase $162.7 million of the failed bank's assets at a discount of $13.8 million.
