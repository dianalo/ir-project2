The GAO said the department isn't adequately checking the accuracy of the bills that lenders submit for their government-subsidized interest payments.    GAO auditors who reviewed 2,038 loan accounts at 16 major lenders found 18% were in error or lacked adequate documentation to support the amount billed.    &quot;The cause of these errors varied, but generally resulted from lenders' miscalculating loan principal balances and interest subsidy due, and continuing to bill the department after borrowers began repaying,&quot; the report said.    Based on the errors found in the loan accounts it reviewed from a three-month period in 1985, the GAO estimated that the government overpaid the 16 lenders at least $1.8 million for that quarter, when they received a total of $69.4 million in interest subsidies.    The GAO said three lenders had voluntarily repaid the government $345,071 in interest subsidy overbillings from that quarter and other recent billing periods.    The department paid lenders $2.4 billion in interest subsidies on $39 billion of guaranteed student loans outstanding in 1986.    An estimated 14,000 lenders -- banks, savings and loan associations, life insurance companies and credit unions -- make the loans. The government guarantees repayment of the loans and pays all the interest until six months after the student leaves college.    &quot;The Department of Education's inadequate oversight could be costing the federal government millions of dollars each year in interest subsidy overpayments to lenders in the guaranteed student loan program,&quot; the GAO said.    The GAO recommended that Congress amend the Higher Education Act to allow the education secretary to charge lenders interest on overpayments and require lenders to have independent auditors verify their loan accounts and interest billings.    The Education Department said it agreed generally with the report and already was taking steps to improve its ability to detect interest billing errors.    &quot;We believe the department currently has the authority to assess interest on overpayments,&quot; the department said, adding that it does not oppose amending the law to spell out that authority. </TEXT></DOC>
