The assistance package, which was sponsored by the House Democratic leaders, also included a $14.6 million fund for children who have been injured in the seven-year civil war. It failed on a 216-208 vote as 45 Democrats, unhappy with the package for various reasons, joined Republicans to oppose it.    Meanwhile, Nicaragua's Sandinista government offered for the first time to negotiate inside Nicaragua with the Contras. But while pledging to send a high-level delegation to peace talks, the government also dismissed Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo as mediator.    The House vote was an embarrassment to the Democratic leadership. They had offered the package to fulfill promises made to moderate members of their party, who were decisive in the House's rejection four weeks ago of President Reagan's $36.2 million Contra aid request but were unwilling to take the political risk of cutting off the rebels altogether.    &quot;We promised they would have a chance for a vote,&quot; House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) said shortly after the package was defeated. &quot;There isn't any of us who can promise a result.&quot;    Unlike President Reagan's aid request, the Democratic package wouldn't have provided any military assistance to the rebels. Just minutes before voting to reject the Democratic package, lawmakers had initially approved the plan, 215-210, as many liberal Democrats cast their first votes ever for direct U.S. aid to the Contras. But then, on the vote for final passage of the bill, 14 Democrats who had first voted for the proposal joined GOP lawmakers and voted against it.    Some of the vote-switchers explained that while they opposed any Contra aid, they had backed the Democratic leadership's plan temporarily in order to defeat a $32.6 million alternative offered by the House Republican leadership. The GOP package could have included military equipment such as trucks and spare parts.    The vote further exacerbated rifts that have divided the House. Many liberal Democrats who supported the bill on both votes felt betrayed by conservative Democrats who opposed the leadership package because it didn't include military assistance. Republicans, meanwhile, stood together to keep up the pressure for renewed military aid and embarrass the Democratic leadership.    Democratic leaders blamed Republicans for the defeat. They said GOP support they had hoped for never materialized. &quot;The Republicans decided to play politics,&quot; said California Rep. Tony Coelho, the Democrat's chief vote-counter. Only five GOP lawmakers voted in favor of final passage for the bill.    Republicans argued that any assistance package that doesn't include military supplies wouldn't help the Nicaraguan insurgents anyway. &quot;They need help, but this package wasn't it,&quot; said Rep. Mickey Edwards (R., Okla.), who led the GOP fight on the floor.    The House vote signals that President Reagan, who has fought for Contra aid longer and harder than any other foreign policy issue, won't be able to win renewed assistance to the rebels either soon or easily. Previously approved assistance ended Monday.    Mr. Reagan, in a statement released by the White House, urged lawmakers to keep trying to develop an aid package for the Nicaraguan rebels. However, Democratic leaders said they wouldn't offer another proposal, and any new GOP request would be subject to various legislative delays and probably wouldn't be brought to a vote until at least summer.    However, if the Sandinistas are seen to be delaying the peace talks, the termination of all aid means there will be greater pressure on lawmakers to approve military aid than if yesterday's package had been approved.    Meanwhile, Contra leaders in Miami blasted the Sandinistas' decision to dismiss Cardinal Obando as &quot;unilateral and dictatorial.&quot; Though the leaders, in a prepared statement, said they accept the Sandinistas' offer of a high-level meeting in Nicaragua, they insisted that Cardinal Obando be retained as moderator.    The cardinal, a prominent Sandinista critic, had been pressing the government to discuss political issues in addition to cease-fire arrangements, a move strongly resisted by the Sandinistas. Many opposition figures say his dismissal could sink the negotiations, despite the Sandinistas' decision to appoint Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, the brother of President Daniel Ortega, to the government team, and to accept the Contras' demand that negotiations be held in Nicaraguan territory.    &quot;The cardinal is the only man who can guarantee the democratization and pacification of Nicaragua,&quot; said rebel leader Aristides Sanchez. &quot;There's no substitute.&quot;    ---   Jeffrey H.
