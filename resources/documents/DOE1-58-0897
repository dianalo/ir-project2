<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-58-0897 </DOCNO><TEXT>The use of a quadrupole mass spectrometer as a rate monitor is describedfor a fast and accurate deposition control down to very low evaporationrates in an ultrahigh vacuum plant. In several applications of this concept,a rate control down to 0.1 A/s in single-source and coevaporation experimentscould be documented for different materials and material combinations.The feasibility of operation at oxygen gas pressures of up to 4.5 x 10{sup-5} mbar is shown for yttrium/copper coevaporations. Multilayer structureswere deposited under microprocessor control with the same rate controlmethod used.</TEXT></DOC>
