 Today he spends a good part of his workday at an IBM PC AT,intently tapping his way through 1-2-3 worksheets.andM;Lynch is just one of 200 young analysts and associates who work in openoffice spaces spread across eight floors at the Manhattan headquarters ofBankers Trust Co.andP;  As part of the Corporate Finance department, their job isto analyze the details of financial proposals for the bank's corporateclients.andP;  And the Lotus spreadsheet program is how they do it.andP;  &quot;We work ourkids awfully hard in 1-2-3,&quot; says Henry Ford, a vice president in theMerchant Banking group.andM;So important is 1-2-3 to the department's operations that facility with theprogram is, some say, a must on the promotion path.andP;  The department hasstandardized on other Lotus software as well-Manuscript Release 2.0,Freelance Release 3.0, and Lotus One Source--mainly because they all work sowell with 1-2-3.andP;  And the department maintains an in-house technical-supportgroup that spends much of its time helping the analysts get up to speed withLotus software.andM;As is the case in many corporations, the power of the computerizedspreadsheet has changed the way Bankers Trust does business.andP;  &quot;It has madethe business more complex,&quot; says Ford.andP;  &quot;We analyze a lot more structures.&quot;andO;And therein, some in the department say, lies a concern.andP;  Sometimes, saysFord, &quot;we suffer from analysis paralysis.&quot;andM;It's hard to say which came first, 1-2-3 or the growing complexity ofcorporate deals.andP;  But without computerized spreadsheets, it might not bepossible to cope effectively with today's alphabet soup of high-financearrangements.andP;  Key ingredients of the soup: Mandamp;As (mergers and acquisitions),MBOs (management buyouts), LBOs (leveraged buyouts), and ESOPs (employeestock-ownership plans).andM;At Bankers Trust these structured financial arrangements can be initiatedinternally or by clients who approach the bank for help.andP;  The bank's seniorstaff handles the contacts with potential buyers, sellers, or investors.andP;  Ananalyst or an associate, the next rung up the ladder in Corporate Finance,starts to crunch the numbers.andM;LET'S MAKE A DEALandM;The analyst turns to a spreadsheet &quot;deal&quot; template.andP;  When considering anacquisition, for example, he or she cranks in the figures from a company'sbalance and income statements, as well as such key data as capitalexpenditures and growth projections.andP;  One type of output is key financialratios, such as receivables turnover, current ratio, and asset coverage.andO;Another is a projection of future performance.andP;  If the results lookpromising, the analyst starts to tailor the worksheet to reflect the proposeddeal.andM;For many acquisitions, an analyst turns first to a computerized data source,such as those available in the Lotus One Source family of products.andO;CD/Investment, for example, provides analysts with a weekly compact-diskcompilation of financial information on companies, stocks, and financialissues.andP;  Analysts use CD/Investment data, along with accompanying searchsoftware, as a first screen for investment takeover targets.andM;Some deals are large and complex, involving tens or even hundreds ofinvestors.andP;  An analyst uses 1-2-3 to assign portions of the proposedinvestment to the &quot;players&quot; that the senior staff has identified.andO;Inevitably, such a deal is restructured to accommodate new players, changingpriorities, or revised economic assumptions.andP;  With a spreadsheet, an analystcan come up with a new deal in less than 24 hours.andM;Although the bank has not mandated a standard for spreadsheet design,convention dictates that all operating assumptions of a deal be clearlydisplayed near the upper-left corner of the spreadsheet.andP;  Most dealworksheets are about 100K in size, but some real estate worksheets run tomore than a megabyte.andP;  all deal worksheets make heavy use of 1-2-3'sfinancial functions, particularly @IRR, @NPV, and @FV.andM;SPEED AND COMPLEXITYandM;The bank's ability to analyze many different scenarios quickly is importantto clients.andP;  Howard Riker, an analyst who specializes in real estate capitalmarkets, notes that the investment market is highly competitive.andP;  &quot;You mustcover all the different cases,&quot; he says, &quot;in order not to get burned.&quot;andM;Among the bank's analysts, there is immense respect for 1-2-3 as a tool.andO;There are also some reservations, however.andP;  Many analysts echo Henry Ford'sconcern over the possibility of &quot;paralysis,&quot; noting that 1-2-3 makes it easyto get lost in formulas and numbers and to lose sight of the deal.andP;  &quot;Too muchanalysis,&quot; says Riker, &quot;clouds the fact that a building is a building and aninvestment is an investment.&quot;andM;Jim Lynch, who works on LBOs and mergers ranging up to $1 billion in size,agrees that it's easy to &quot;get lost in a model.&quot;andP;  Lots of analysis, he says,&quot;can still be done effectively on the back of an envelope.&quot;andM;Like many 1-2-3 users, the bank's analysts realize that there are technicallimits to what the program can do well.andP;  There is some dissatisfaction withrecalculation speeds.andP;  The limitations of the program's graphical output longago led to reliance to Freelance, a powerful graphics program.andP;  As fordatabase operations, Ken Abbott, vice president of research and analytics inthe Money Market Economics group, says, &quot;You have to move to dBase at around1,000 records.&quot;andP;  Some people also use Paradox, a stand-alone, multiuserdatabase program from Borland International.andM;THE 'DEAL BOOK'andM;Graphics output is important at Bankers Trust, and so is high-end wordprocessing.andP;  That's because all of the number crunching eventually has toresult in a clear--and impressive--document for the client.andP;  That document isknown as the &quot;deal book.&quot;andM;The deal book combines spreadsheets, text, and charts and graphs.andP;  A majorpurpose of the book, says a bank executive, is to increase the &quot;knowledgelevel&quot; of potential investors.andM;The importance of the deal book goes further.andP;  The bank sometimes generatesnew business by brainstorming a deal and then seeking out investors.andP;  Animpressive presentation of the data is a key marketing tool.andM;In the past, the staff used WordPerfect to prepare text, and producing thedeal book required a lot of cutting and pasting.andP;  That's now changing, thanksto Manuscript.andM;Manuscript can import a 1-2-3 worksheet.andP;  It can also import a PIC file from1-2-3 and a GMF or CGM file from Freelance.andP;  so it's possible to print ooutcomplete dealbook pages on a laser printer, with text, tables, charts, andgraphs all in place.andM;Lynda DiMicelli, a word-processing support specialist, helps analysts andassociates with document-design problems.andP;  &quot;The first tim eI imported a 1-2-3worksheet into Manuscript, it took me an hour to et everything lookingright,&quot; she says.andP;  Now she can import a worksheet or a graph in less than aminute.andM;DiMicelli says her most frequent recommendation is to limit the number ofdifferent fonts used in a document.andP;  She is also lobbying for her group tofollow the lead of other groups in Corporate Finance and adopt Manuscripttemplates.andP;  Just as analysts now use 1-2-3 templates for analyzing deals,DiMicelli would like to have her department use Manuscript templates toproduce deal books.andP;  Such a template would position titles, headers, footers,and the like, and would specify the font types and sizes to be used for allcomponents.andM;Such standardization would make it easier for DiMicelli to maintain thedesired level of presentation quality.andP;  And it would boost her productivity.andO;It now takes DiMicelli several hours to produce a typical deal book, whichcan run to 50 pages.andP;  She'd like to cut that time down.andM;TRAINING AND SUPPORTandM;Standing behind DiMicelli, the analysts, and the rest of the 1,200-memberCorporate Finance department is a three-person software-support group headedby Bonnie Ketcham.andP;  The group is dedicated to training and support, mainlyfor Lotus software.andP;  Ketcham joined Bankers Trust as an accountant eightyears ago, but her enthusiasm for the Pc eventually propelled her into herpresent role.andP;  Ketcham, says Riker, &quot;is one of the greatest resources we havearound here.&quot;andM;Her group contracts with Lotus-authorized training firms for entry-levelcourses on Manuscript, Freelance, and 1-2-3.andP;  But it also provides in-housetraining on advanced 1-2-3 topics, such as macros, as well as on Lotus OneSource and Manuscript.andM;Ketcham prefers in-house training for advanced users because she can tailorthe instruction to the specific needs of the analysts.andP;  The training job ismade easier, says Ketcham, by the similarity of the user interface acrossLotus products.andP;  &quot;There's less hand-holding,&quot; she says, when users move fromtheir first Lotus program to their second.andP;  She cites as real benefits thecommon menu structures and screen layouts that Lotus products share.andM;In addition to training, Ketcham's group uses Manuscript to publish aquarterly newsletter, as well as occasional product &quot;quick tip&quot; sheets.andP;  Themost recent issue of Ketcham's newsletter included an article listing thesoftware that her group will evaluate this year.andP;  The products include DOS4.0, OS/2, Presentation Manager, 1-2-3 Releases 3 and 2.2, 1-2-3/G, Paradox,and dBase IV.andP;  Another article told how to upgrade to Freelance Release 3.0and how to use some of the new features in Manuscript Release 2.0.andP;  Amongfuture topics: how to use Funk Software's Allways to dress up worksheets andhot to upgrade to 1-2-3 Release 3 or 2.2.andM;Ketcham is already to assess the likely impact of the new Lotus proeucts--notjust 1-2-3 Releases 3 and 2.2, but the graphics-based version of 1-2-3 andthe expected database program as well.andP;  Despite cost, training, and supportconsiderations, her early decision is to recommend a large-scale upgrade to1-2-3 Releases 3 and 2.2.andP;  &quot;If someone has the hardware to run it,&quot; she says,&quot;he'll get Release 3.&quot;andM;THE PROMOTION TRACKandM;Clearly, the bank's analysts will welcome all the help they can get.andP;  Thefaster and better they can crunch the numbers, the more likely they are tomove ahead.andP;  Increasingly, analysts arrive from business school alreadyknowing how to use 1-2-3.andP;  A new hire who can use the @IRR function or writea macro is a step ahead of one who has to browse through 1-2-3's menus andhelp screens or study the manual.andM;The bank's career ladder leads upward from analyst to associate, vicepresident, and managing director.andP;  Of course, facility with 1-2-3 will take ayoung executive just so far.andP;  At the vice-president level, the bank demandsnot just analystical skills but expertise in accounting, taxes, and law.andM;&quot;There will always be enough smart young kids to do the number crunching,&quot;says Vice President Ford.andP;  &quot;Your get paid the big money for figuring out thetough legal, tax, and accounting problems.&quot;andM;THE BIGGEST DEAL EVERandM;Vice President Ken Abbott got the call from his boss at 4 P.M.andP;  on Friday.andP;  AVP of research in the Money Market Economics group, Abbott was preparing togo to London to install some information systems he had written.andP;  He'd haveto put off the trip.andM;The bank, he learned, was going to be one of the major selling engines in thebiggest leveraged buyout ever to hit Wall Street: the RJR Nabiscotransaction.andP;  The $25 billion LBO was attracting a host of buyout specialistsand would likely net the principals, their lawyers, and their investmentbankers a cool $1 billion in fees.andP;  Abbott's group would play a role in thebank's overall RJR effort originated by Corporate Finance.andM;To be a player, the bank had to adhere to a short time line that allottedonly 36 hours to produce a plan to allocate pieces of the deal among morethan 100 investors.andP;  The challenge to Abbott: Create in a day and a half aworksheet that would model the allocation of senior bank debt among all theplayers.andM;Abbott, a high-energy hacker who boasts that he can make his '386 machine&quot;rock,&quot; went to work.andP;  His object was to develop a model that divvied upparticipation based on the number of interested players and the sizes ofcommitments each could handle.andM;By 10 P.M.andP;  Friday, Abbott recalls, &quot;I knew I could do it.&quot;andP;  In his words, he&quot;kludged togethe some basic formulas to calculate allocations and then cameup with a two-way lookup table.&quot;andP;  That table was the key.andP;  It containedspecifics on more tan 125 banks that might have been interested in the deal.andO;The table also let Abbott structure a distribution plan that, he sas, &quot;keptexposure reasonable for all the players.&quot;andM;On Saturday Abbott ironed out the bugs, cleaned up the formulas, and usedAllways to make the worksheet look &quot;fancy.&quot;andP;  Abbott calls his 1-2-3allocation model &quot;a work of art,&quot; though he concedes that the worksheetitself used a lot of &quot;brute-force&quot; problem-solving techniques.andP;  In any case,by Sunday morning he and the bank were ready to present his allocation modelto potential investors.andM;COLLECTING DATA FOR THE BUDGETandM;At Bankers Trust, enthusiasm for 1-2-3 is not confined to the deal makers.andO;The Lotus spreadsheet program has also become a key tool in the bank's annualbudgeting process.andM;Here, the spreadsheet's role is data collection.andP;  Each year, the bank sends afloppy disk containing a 1-2-3 budget template out to each of its 200operating groups in the United States and abroad.andP;  The 380K template ismacro-driven and self-documenting, and it provides space for up to 500 lineitems.andP;  After entering budget items and dollar amounts, an operating managerprints a range of the worksheet, normally about 30K in size, to an ASCIIfile.andP;  The floppy disk is then sent to one of eight data-collection sites.andM;At each collection site, a budget coordinator uploads the 30K ASCII files byphone line to a mainframe in New York City.andP;  There the data is imported intoa database programmed with Focus, a fourth-generation database language thatallows a programmer to specify the job to be accomplished rather than theprocedures to be used.andM;Jim Foley, a vice president in the bank's controller's office, designed the1-2-3 budget template.andP;  He reasoned that budgeters would be familiar with1-2-3, or at least would find help readily at hand if they needed it.andP;  Buthis macros and custom menus were designed to make the program as simple aspossible.andM;For Foley, the biggest payoff has been better control over the budget.andO;According to Foley, the bank's organizational structure frequently changes,and prior to budgeting with 1-2-3 and Focus, it was difficult &quot;to movedollars around.&quot;andP;  Now, as shifts in staffing occur, Foley's group can quicklymodify the budget to reflect the changes.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
