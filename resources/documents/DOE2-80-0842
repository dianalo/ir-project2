Two parameters are used for description of temperaturedistribution: a local (time-average) divergence function and an instant(volumetric) divergence function. Formulae for determining the two parametersare derived. Use of the mean values of the two functions as an evaluationcriteria for assessment of the coking process is recommended. Practicaluse of the proposed criteria is discuussed. 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
