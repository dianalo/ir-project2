This FMP culminates a ten-year effort by the Councilto address the concerns of various user groups while at the same time acknowledgingmore than 20 years of management of crab by the State. It contains a generalmanagement goal with seven management objectives identified, and relevantmanagement measures required to meet the objectives that are presented.The FMP establishes three categories of management measures: (1) Fixedmeasures implemented by the State, that require an FMP amendment to change;(2) measures that the State may implement and amend, subject to Federalcriteria specified in the FMP, and enforce against State-registered vesselsin the exclusive economic zone (EEZ); and (3) measures that the State mayimplement and amend, without specific Federal criteria specified in theFMP, and enforce against State-registered vessels in the EEZ. Several managementmeasures may contribute to more than one objective, and several objectivesmay mesh in any given decision on a case-by-case basis. In adopting the FMP, the Council intended that, to the extent practicable,the State should continue to play a leading role in the management of theKing and Tanner crab fisheries in the Bering Sea/Aleutians Islands. Alaskahas developed a comprehensive management system for managing the King andTanner Crab fisheries off its shores, both within and beyond the three-milelimit. This system, representing the acquired expertise of scores of Stateemployees and an investment by that State over the years of many millionsof dollars, could not be duplicated in the near future by the NationalMarine Fisheries Service (NMFS). At the same time, some residents of Statesother than Alaska who participate or previously participated in the crabfisheries have long been concerned about their lack of representation onthe Alaska Board of Fisheries (Board) and in the Alaska Department of Fishand Game (ADandamp;G), the agencies that manage fisheries on behalf of Alaska.In order to take minimum advantage of Alaska's ability and willingnessto continue to manage the King and Tanner crab fisheries while at the sametime providing sufficient Federal oversight to ensure representation andconsideration of non-Alaskan concerns, the FMP provides for a special meansof access to the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands King and Tanner crab regulatoryprocess for nonresidents of Alaska through a Pacific Northwest Crab IndustryAdvisory Committee (PNCIAC). The PNCIAC will meet at appropriate timesand places throughout the year to review and advise the State and the Councilon crab management issues, stock status information, and biological andeconomic analyses relating to the crab fisheries. The FMP also establishesa Crab Interim Action Committee (CIAC) composed of the Alaska RegionalDirector of NMFS, the Commissioner of ADFandamp;G, and the Director of theWashington State Department of Fisheries, or their designees. The CIACwill provide oversight of the FMP and provide for Council review of managementmeasures and other relevant matters. Representatives from the Council, NMFS, and NOAA General Counsel will participatein the State development of regulations for management of King and Tannercrab fisheries in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands area, including directlyparticipating in the Board meeting for the purpose of assisting the Statein determining the extent to which proposed management measures are consistentwith the FMP, the Magnuson Act, and other applicable Federal law. Federalmanagement oversight is also provided in the form of a review and appealsprocedure for all State preseason and in-season crab management measuresapplicable to State-registered vessels in the EEZ. All current State lawsapplicable to fishing vessels in the EEZ have been reviewed by the Secretaryand found facially consistent with the FMP. Preseason and in-season Statemanagement measures will be reviewed by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)as a matter of discretion, or upon timely appeal by an interested party.Secretarial review is limited to whether the challenged State law is consistentwith the FMP, the Magnuson Act, or other applicable Federal law. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments </ITAG>Written comments were received from the ADFandamp;G and three industry associations.In general, the ADFandamp;G commented that the FMP is not necessary for themanagement of King and Tanner crab fisheries of the Bering Sea/AleutianIslands (BS/AI), but ADFandamp;G will participate in a cooperative FMP providedthat Federal funds are available to cover implementation costs to the State.Two of the industry associations recommend the approval of the FMP withvarious modifications. One industry association objects to deferring management authority to theState and believes that a conventional FMP is necessary. The following are specific comments on the FMP and NOAA's responses: <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter noted the following three key factors influencingthe need for an FMP for the BS/AI crab fisheries: (1) The majority of participantsin the fisheries are nonresidents of Alaska, (2) the coastal boundary ofthe fishing area is unique, incorporating the largest coastline of anyEEZ fishery and bordering only one state, and (3) controversial allocationissues necessitate the protection afforded by an FMP. <T3>Response:</T3> This comment reaffirms past concerns expressed by somecrab industry members and contains some of the chief reasons why the Councilhas submitted the FMP for Secretarial review. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter indicated that his association is now substantiallyin agreement on most of the FMP issues except pot limits, exclusive registration,and closed waters, all of which the State maintains it must preside over.This commenter stated his concerns as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Pot limits (gear limitation): A limit on the number of pots wouldbe unenforceable in this high seas, offshore and remote fishery. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. (Exclusive) Registration: This is a <T3>defacto form</T3> of limited entry that would ultimately favor residentsmall boat fishermen that do not depend on the need for mobility, to movefrom one fishery to another within the geographic area. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Closed Waters (Jurisdiction): State priority giving subsistenceusers exclusive fishing areas is objectionable. Expansion and or creationof new subsistence fishing zones should be restricted to the jurisdictionof the NPFMC along with jurisdiction over andplusmin;1 and andplusmin;2 above.</ITAG><T3>Response:</T3> 1. Although section 8.2.7 of the FMP authorizes theState to promulgate pot limits for purposes specified in the FMP, NOAAnotes that no pot limits are currently imposed in the management area.The Secretary also notes that section 8.2.7 of the FMP requires the Stateto consider, among other factors, the enforceability of any proposed potlimits. Consequently, practicality of enforcement will be addressed ifand when the State decides to promulgate any limits on the number of potsa vessel may deploy or carry. 2. Section 8.2.8 of the FMP authorizes the State to designate, subjectto limitations, crab exclusive registration areas. Under exclusive areadesignation, the operator of any fishing vessel may register for fishingin a single exclusive area without restriction, but cannot fish in anyother exclusive area during the registration year. Any vessel may, however,fish in all nonexclusive areas without restriction, even if registeredin an exclusive area. In an appropriate case, exclusive area designation may aid in dispersingfishing effort while still allowing the fleet the opportunity to harvestthe available crab resource. Exclusive area designation may also allowsmall, less mobile vessels the opportunity to fish in accessible watersnear the home port of those vessels, while allowing the larger, more mobilevessels to fully harvest available crab resources elsewhere. Exclusive area designation may, in any particular case, result in allocationof fishing opportunities among the fleet. Such allocation may be permissibleunder national standard 4 of the Magnuson Act if fair and equitable toall fishermen, reasonably calculated to promote conservation, and carriedout in such a manner that no single entity acquires an excessive shareof fishing privileges. In addition, section 8.2.8 of the FMP specifiessix factors that the State must consider when proposing an exclusive areadesignation. Those factors include the extent to which the proposed designationwill encourage efficiency and provide all vessels a reasonable opportunityto participate in the fishery. These factors must be considered if andwhen exclusive areas are designated. 3. Section 8.2.9 of the FMP authorizes the State to designate and modifycommercial fishery closures to meet State subsistence obligations. TheState, if and when it proposes such a closure or modification, must considerthe need to protect subsistence fisheries, the need to protect criticalhabitat, prevention of conflict, and creation of navigational hazard. It is important to remember that the Secretary will review measures adoptedby the State to determine if they are consistent with the FMP, the MagnusonAct, and its national standards in accordance with chapters 9 and 10 ofthe FMP. Restricting the authority of the Council over these three management measuresby placing them into Category 1 (fixed measures) was considered and rejectedby the Council. The State is and has been intimately involved in the managementof the king and Tanner crab fisheries and has long-term monitoring, enforcement,and research programs in place. The perceived net benefits of utilizingthe existing State programs versus the costs of developing entirely newFederal programs led the Council to direct the Council's Crab ManagementCommittee to develop a cooperative State/Federal management plan in whichsignificant authority is deferred to the State. The Council wanted to avoid problems that were experienced with the repealedTanner crab FMP, and ensure that the new FMP is flexible enough to providefor management based on the best scientific information available and providefor timely Federal and State coordination of management. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter concluded that E.O. 12612, the ExecutiveOrder on Federalism, in no way interferes with adoption and implementationof the FMP. <T3>Response: </T3>A Federalism Assessment prepared by NOAA concluded thatthe FMP complies with the criteria and principles of Executive Order 12612.Copies are available from the Alaska Regional Office. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter discussed the importance and necessityof an FMP for the BS/AI crab stocks. In supporting the need for an FMP,he cited Congressional intent, conservation and management requirementof the BS/AI crab fishery, and Federal statutes and guidelines. <T3>Response: </T3>Comment noted. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters presented several suggested modificationsfor the Secretary to incorporate into the FMP. <T3>Response: </T3>The Secretary is required to approve, disapprove, orpartially disapprove plans after the 75th day, but before the close ofthe 95th day, following receipt of a plan. He is to review the FMP to determinewhether it is consistent with the national standards, other provisionsof the Magnuson Act, and any other applicable law. There is no provisionfor making substantive modifications to the FMP at this stage of the reviewprocess. The commenters should make any request for substantive chargesto the FMP to the Council for future consideration. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that the FMP descriptions of theuse of economic data within the crab management process do not clearlyrecognize that socioeconomic or bio-economic objectives are secondary toresource conservation concerns. <T3>Response: </T3>NOAA refers the commenter to section 7.2.1 of the FMP,which states that ``* * * the maintenance of adequate reproductive potentialin each crab stock will take precedence over economic and social considerations.''Provisions of the Magnuson Act, including National Standard 1, also establishthe paramountcy of resource conservation. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter said that the Secretary should clearlystate that economic and social considerations alone may not be used tojustify management measures. He recommended modifying the FMP so that marketand other economic considerations are not the sole criterion used in settingminimum size limits or setting guidelines harvest levels (GHLs). <T3>Response: </T3>As stated above, NOAA cannot make substantive changesto the Council's FMP text at this time. However, the commenter's suggestedaddition is unnecessary; Magnuson Act national standard 5 states that noconservation and management measure may have economic allocation as itssole purpose. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter states that the descriptions in the FMPwhich justify management measures that maintain or improve the economicstability of coastal communities cause deep concern. The commenter believesthat this will likely create conflict, cause inefficiency, and serve asan economic allocation scheme, potentially violating National Standard5, and that such a preference scheme should not be the sole criterion onwhich EEZ management measures are based. <T3>Response: </T3>The Secretary will review measures adopted by the Stateto determine if they are consistent with the FMP, the Magnuson Act, andits national standards in accordance with chapters 9 and 10 of the FMP.Because measures aimed at stabilizing coastal communities have purposesbeyond economic allocation, they are unlikely to conflict with nationalstandard 5. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter states that the FMP allows State and Federalobserver programs to coexist without coordination.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter states that the <T3>Response: </T3>NOAA refers the commenter to section 8.1.3 of the FMPwhich states, ``To the maximum extent practicable, the Regional Directorwill coordinate any Federal observer program with that required by theState.'' NOAA notes that there are no present plans for a Federal observerprogram for the crab fisheries under this FMP. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter contends that separate but similar observerprograms are burdensome and cause unnecessary duplication. <T3>Response: </T3>The State currently has a crab observer program in place,while the Federal Government does not. Any concern of duplication of futureobserver programs will be reviewed by the Secretary if and when a Federalprogram is considered. NOAA notes that Magnuson Act national standard 7prohibits, where practicable, unnecessary duplication. <T3>Comment: </T3>Frameworking does not adequately prevent the inequitableand discriminatory application of pot limtis against larger vessels. <T3>Response: </T3>The framework language in section 8.2.7 of the FMP requiresthat pot limits be designated in a nondiscriminatory manner. For example,the FMP states that pot limits related to vessel size could affect smalland large vessels equally. Currently, there are no pot limits in effectin the management unit. If pot limits are implemented in the future, theymust be designated in a nondiscriminatory manner. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter points out that pot limits are unnecessarybecause alternative management measures may be utilized to meet the sameobjectives served by pot limits. <T3>Response: </T3>NOAA believes that the availability of other types ofmanagement measures for meeting the same objective is not sufficient reasonto eliminate a viable management tool, assuming it is applied consistentlywith the FMP, the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Council hasprepared a cooperative FMP to try to preserve the flexibility of Statemanagement, not restrict it unnecessarily. <T3>Comment: </T3>Registration areas do not need to be frameworked. Anamendment cycle does not place a restraint on the State great enough tojustify discretionary use of a frameworked management measure. <T3>Response: </T3>NOAA approves the Council's designation of registrationareas as Category 2 (frameworked) measures. The Council determined thatsituations might arise in which a timely change to registration area designationwould serve a legitimate conservation and management purpose. <T3>Comment: </T3>Closed water regulations unnecessarily duplicate otherFMP regulations.<T3>Response: </T3>NOAA believes that the State should have the flexibilityto achieve its legitimate management purposes by a combination of measures,and that there is no reason why the Federal Government should unnecessarilyrestrict the State. NOAA notes that any State measures closing waters tocommercial fishing must be consistent with the provisions of the FMP, theMagnuson Act, and other applicable law.<T3>Comment: </T3>Frameworking of closed water designations provides theState with too much discretion to prohibit commercial fishing.<T3>Response: </T3>The FMP is intended to preserve, within the limits ofFederal law, the State's management flexibility. The Secretary will reviewmanagement actions taken by the State, including changes in closed waters,and if the State action violates the FMP, the Magnuson Act, or other applicableFederal law, the Secretary will act to supersede the State regulation inthe EEZ.<T3>Comment: </T3>The FMP unlawfully grants to the State jurisdiction toclose waters outside of State territorial waters. Furthermore, the FMPdoes not discuss the extent to which it recognizes the State regulationsrelevant to Tanner crabs, subsistence harvests, and commercial fisheries.<T3>Response: </T3>Section 306(a)(3) of the Magnuson Act provides thata State may regulate fishing vessels outside its boundaries if the vesselsare registered under the law of the State. The FMP, at Section 8.1.2, assumesthat all crab vessels are licensed and registered under the laws of theState. While fishing in the EEZ they are subject to all State regulationsthat are consistent with the FMP, Magnuson Act, and other applicable Federallaw. If, in the future, vessels participate in the fishery without registeringwith the State, it is likely that an FMP amendment will be required toestablish vessel registration for those fishermen operating in the EEZ.<T3>Comment: </T3>The Board of Fisheries and the Commissioner of ADFandamp;Gcurrently entertain only administrative appeals concerning conservationemergencies. Moreover, the FMP states that the Secretary will not consideran appeal unless the appeal asserts a state regulation or statute is inconsistentwith the FMP, the Magnuson Act, or other applicable Federal law. Consequently,interested parties have no forum for appeals which do not meet any of theState or Federal criteria. The commenter recommends language changes tochapters 9 and 10 of the FMP broadening the scope of the Secretarial appealssection to include more Federal policy oversight on State management decisions.<T3>Response: </T3>This FMP is written as a cooperative FMP in an attemptto avoid problems that were encountered in the implementation of the previousTanner and King crab FMPs. It is intended to optimize the use of limitedState and Federal resources and prevent duplication of effort by makinguse of the existing State management expertise.The State has made a substantial investment in facilities, communications,information systems, vessels, equipment, experienced personnel capableof carrying out extensive crab management, and research and enforcementprograms. The intent of the FMP is to preserve the State's management flexibilitywithin the bounds of Federal law. The FMP is predicated on continued soundState management policy, with full public participation in the State'sregulatory process. The language changes suggested by the commenter woulddiminish the State's ability to exercise that policy discretion.<T3>Comment: </T3>The CICA decision process is unclear. The FMP does notclarify how the CIAC recommendations and decisions will be made.<T3>Response: </T3>The Council will establish operating procedures forthe CIAC as it does for all standing committees. The commenter is urgedto raise its concerns with the Council.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter indicated that his association is pleasedto see an FMP covering the BS/AI crab stocks. He also strongly recommendedthat work begin immediately to prepare an FMP for the Gulf of Alaska crabstocks. <T3>Response:</T3> Comment noted. The commenter should make his requestfor an FMP for the Gulf of Alaska stocks to the Council. <T3>Comment:</T3> The State believes that an FMP is unnecessary and thatthe primary changes resulting from the FMP are merely the additional regulatoryprocesses associated with extra layers of administration of crab management.The State questions whether the FMP will resolve critical problems andprovide meaningful benefits to participants in the fisheries, regulatoryagencies, and the nation overall. <T3>Response:</T3> The FMP is the product of a ten-year effort by the Councilto balance the concerns of various user groups with the 20-year recordof successful management of crab by the State. It formalizes commitmentsby the State and Federal governments, providing for the Board to take thelead role in crab management, but reserves oversight responsibility tothe Secretary to ensure that State preseason and in-season actions complywith the FMP, the Magnuson Act, and other Federal law. NOAA believes thatthe cooperative FMP is the best approach to management of the crab fisheriesin the BS/AI area and that it will provide meaningful benefits by limitingthe State's discretion so that discrimination by state of residence willbe less likely. <T3>Comment:</T3> The State believes that the benefits derived from anFMP could be obtained more efficiently and effectively by instituting thefollowing five modifications to the current regulatory system: (1) ADFandamp;Gand the Board could formally adopt a policy of nondiscrimination basedon residency for allocation decisions within commercial fisheries; (2)an industry funded PNCIAC could be sanctioned without implementing an FMP;a nonresident seat on the Dutch Harbor Advisory Committee has already beencreated and an informal guide describing the State regulatory system couldbe prepared; (3) more frequent meetings could be held between the ADFandamp;G,Board of Fisheries, NMFS, and interestd crab industry members; (4) a jointstatement of principles could be prepared between NMFS and ADFandamp;G, withan annual review by the Secretary of all State management actions, and(5) a memorandum of understanding could be developed between the Stateand the U.S. Coast Guard to formalize enforcement commitments. <T3>Response:</T3> NOAA believes that the cooperative FMP is a preferableform of management. Controversial management measures are either fixedin the FMP requiring an FMP amendment to change or frameworked with factorsfor the State to consider when information is available. This providesan extra degree of predictability to the management process. NOAA alsobelieves that additional benefits will be derived from the formal appealsprocess that is contained in the FMP. <T3>Comment:</T3> The State indicated that if the Secretary determinesan FMP is necessary for managing the king and Tanner crab fisheries ofthe BS/AI, it will require Federal funds in the amount of $181,400 to covercosts to the State associated with implementation of the FMP during thefirst year, and $171,400 annually thereafter. <T3>Response:</T3> The Alaska Region, NMFS, has requested supplementalfunding to cover any additional costs to the State, and will work withthe State on determination of what such costs should be. NOAA has madeno advance commitment of specific funding. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed concern with an FMP that delegatesFederal management authority to the State. <T3>Response:</T3> The FMP does not delegate Federal management authorityto the State. The FMP allows continuation of the State's authority overvessels in the EEZ, to the extent authorized under the Magnuson Act, subjectto Federal oversight. Three categories of management measures are created: (1) Those that arespecifically fixed in the FMP, and require an FMP amendment to change;(2) those that are framework-type measures which the State can change followingcriteria set out in the FMP, and (3) those measures that are neither rigidlyspecified nor frameworked in the FMP. The measures in (2) and (3) may beadopted as State laws subject to the appeals process outlined in the FMP.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter believes that nonresidents of the Statewill not receive equal treatment with Alaska residents. <T3>Response:</T3> Magnuson Act national standard 4 and other Federal andState laws protect against discrimination based on state of residence.The FMP also affords a formalized review and appeals procedure to preventthe possibility of such discrimination. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed concern that the FMP's conceptcould become a precedent for management of groundfish fisheries. <T3>Response:</T3> This FMP recognizes the State's expertise in managingthe king and Tanner crab fisheries. NOAA, at this time, is not consideringdeferring management authority for the groundfish to the State. <T3>Comment:</T3> The FMP should be amended to allow for groundfish fishermento participate in the crab decisionmaking process relative to crabbers'bycatch needs. The FMP should specify criteria for selection of groundfishfishermen as participants on both the Alaska Board of Fisheries and theadvisory PNCIAC. <T3>Response: </T3>Under current State regulations, groundfish fishermen,as well as any other interested members of the public, may participatein the Board's regulatory process (see Appendix C of the FMP). NOAA considersthis level of public participation adequate. The Council is responsiblefor establishing membership qualifications for the PNCIAC. <T3>Comment: </T3>The cooperative management contemplated by the FMP isa total abandonment of the entire purpose and policy underlying the enactmentof the Magnuson Act. <T3>Response: </T3>This FMP incorporated management measures necessaryand appropriate for the conservation and the management of the fishery.The FMP limits direct Federal involvement but retains Federal oversightto assure compliance with the FMP, Magnuson Act, and other applicable Federallaw. This approach is consistent with the purposes and policy of the MagnusonAct and is not an abandonment of Federal responsibilities. Regionalizationwas built into the Magnuson Act to provide flexibility and creativity indealing with unique or unusual fisheries. <T3>Comment: </T3>Although the FMP requires the State to consider the impactson coastal communities of its management measures, it does not define whichcoastal communities will be considered and how impacts on coastal communitieswill be quantified, and how those impacts for non-Alaskan coastal communitieseffectively can be presented and evaluated under the FMP. The special interesttreatment envisioned is ill-conceived and will not square with nationalstandards. These oversights should be corrected before FMP implementation.<T3>Response: </T3>Section 7.2.2 of the FMP states that fishery managementmeasures shall maximize economic and social benefits to the nation overtime. Economic and social benefit is a complex term as it relates to fisherymanagement. The FMP broadly defines economic and social benefits to include,without limitation, ``profits, income, employment, benefits to consumers,and less tangible or less quantifiable social benefits such as the economicstability of coastal communities;'' (FMP andSection; 7.2.2). Thus, economicstability of coastal communities is just one of the broad range of issuesthat may be considered when assessing the economic and social effects ofany management measure. The commenter correctly points out that the FMP does not specify whichcoastal communities will be considered and how impacts on those communitieswill be quantified. This lack of specificity is unavoidable at this point.However, as particular management measures are proposed and evaluated,relevant impacts on affected coastal communities will be evaluated as thoroughlyas available data allow. The commenter is also apparently concerned that the FMP ignores socialand economic dependence of communities outside Alaska. NOAA notes thatthe FMP does not prohibit the State and the Secretary from consideringthe relevant impacts of proposed measures on all affected communities,whether inside or outside the State of Alaska. NOAA also notes that MagnusonAct National Standard 4, the FMP, and other applicable law prohibit conservationand management measures that discriminate between residents of differentstates. <T3>Comment: </T3>The FMP fails to specify, in detail, procedures to beused in deriving guideline harvest levels (GHLs) or biomass estimates forthe crab stocks. Use of this resource and attainment of optimum yield (OY)must maintain a national perspective. The FMP relies upon historical harvestlevels as a basic methodology to establish maximum sustainable yield (MSY),OY, and upper limits for annual catch levels. This approach is questionableand could lead to arbitrary and politically motivated management decisions.This could be avoided through mandatory annual stock assessment proceduresto attain crab biomass data which will provide confidence in determiningthe amount of crab available.<T3>Response: </T3>Although the estimate of MSY is of questionable utilityin managing crab stocks due primarily to highly variable recruitment, MSYhas been estimated on the basis of the best scientific data available foreach species and stock of king and Tanner crab covered in this FMP. Lackingdetailed information, MSY is equated to the average catch levels in recentfisheries. The FMP defines optimum yield in Chapter 4. The definition of OY prescribesthat the benefits of the fishery resources be allocated among all of thepeople affected by the fishery. The estimates of OY indicate short-termharvest potential during periods of high crab abundance. However, theymay overstate the harvest potential on a continuing basis, because peaksof harvest associated with developing fisheries may have contributed tosubsequent volatility in the abundance of crab stocks. In addition the OY estimates do not indicate which stocks should be subjectto rebuilding schedules, not the manner in which the national interestis served over time through a balance of economic, social, and ecologicalfactors relevant to OY. Because of temporal variability in these factors,GHLs are adjusted annually based upon current evaluations of the biologicaland socioeconomic components. The large upper limit on OYs is specifiedto accommodate the full range of possible GHL specifications dependingupon annual assessments of short- and long-term tradeoffs in these factors.The GHL is composed primarily of two interrelated components: a biologicalcomponent and a socioeconomic component. The FMP requires the State toconsider five factors (see section 8.2.2 of the FMP) to the extent informationis available when establishing GHLs.The process of determining a GHL which prevents recruitment overfishingand maximizes socioeconomic benefits includes the routine collection andanalysis of biological, economic, social, and other data. Crab resourcesof the BS/AI area vary in the level of scientific information availablefor management. Consequently, exact procedures for determining appropriateacceptable biological catches and GHLs vary due to differences in the qualityand quantity of resource data bases. Information necessary to evaluatethe five Federally approved factors for establishing GHLs include datafrom trawl surveys, pot surveys, fishery performance statistics (catchper unit of effort), price, personal income, employment and other marketand income data. NOAA fisheries already conducts an annual trawl survey in the eastern BeringSea to determine the distribution and abundance of the crab resources.<T3>Comment: </T3>Observers are needed on crab vessels. The current Stateprogram has not collected detailed data on a timely basis. The FMP shouldrequire all crab catcher vessels to accept NMFS observers if requestedto do so. A requirement placing NMFS observers on crab catcher vesselswhile fishing in the EEZ should be incorporated into the FMP. <T3>Response: </T3>NOAA agrees observer requirements are important to attainmentof the biological conservation and research and management objectives ofthe FMP. The commenter is referred to section 8.1.3 of the FMP, which states,``Any vessel fishing for king or Tanner crab, and/or processing king orTanner crab within the BS/AI area, shall be required to take aboard anobserver, when so requested by the Director, Alaska Region, NMFS.'' NOAAconsiders the current level of State observer coverage adequate at thistime.<T3>Comment: </T3>Allocative management measures should be confined toCategory 1; as a minimum, the following should be fixed in the FMP as Federalmanagement measures: pot limits, registration areas, closed waters, reportingrequirements, and bycatch limits. They key management concepts currentlylisted within the frameworking Category 2 should be placed within Category1. This will ensure a balanced approach and prevent discrimination on thebasis of State residence.<T3>Response: </T3>The Council designed this FMP as a cooperative FMP forreasons previously mentioned. The FMP describes legitimate and non-allocativereasons for all of these management measures. There is no reason to denythe State the flexibility needed to manage the crab resources in the mostefficient and timely manner possible. All management measures must be consistentwith the FMP, Magnuson Act, and other applicable Federal law, all of whichprevent discrimination on the basis of State residence.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter states that the FMP framework provisionsdo not conform with the NMFS Operational Guidelines-Fishery ManagementPlan Process (1983).<T3>Response: </T3>The commenter evidently has confused the concept ofFederal frameworking with the concept of frameworking utilized in thisFMP. The NMFS Operational Guideline citation refers to a conventional frameworkedFMP, implemented by Federal regulations pursuant to the Magnuson Act. Althoughthis cooperative FMP uses the term ``framework,'' it results instead inthe limited deferral of management authority to the State within the boundariesdefined in the FMP. The cited NMFS Operational Guidelines are inapposite.<T3>Comment: </T3>The FMP defers reporting requirements to the State. Thisis unacceptable because the crab fishery bycatch of both crab and halibutremain unaccounted. Handling and other bycatch mortality of crab is noteffectively measured under this system. Reporting requirements need tobe designated Category 1 management measures.<T3>Response: </T3>Placing reporting requirements into Category 1 wouldunnecessarily limit the State's flexibility to promulgate conservationand management measures in a timely manner. NOAA notes that the State alreadycollects information on incidental catches in crab pots from ADFandamp;Gsamplers, interviews and observers on board catcher processors and usessuch information in determining the need for fisheries closures (see StateE.O. 4-2-09-89). The commenter is urged to suggest any modifications tothis program to the appropriate State agency.<T3>Comment: </T3>Any decision regarding the amount of crab allowable asbycatch in groundfish fisheries is an allocation decision, and should bereserved to the Council.<T3>Response: </T3>The crab FMP only defers bycatch limits in crab fisheriesto the State. Crab bycatch in groundfish fisheries is managed under theFishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea andAleutian Islands area implemented by regulations at 50 CFR 611.93 and 50CFR Part 675.<T3>Comment: </T3>Bycatch limits should be set for crab fishermen. Thiswill have the positive impact of encouraging a reduction in the crab fishermen'sincidence of non-target crab bycatch.<T3>Reponse: </T3>The FMP already authorizes the State to impose bycatchlimits without the need for FMP amendment. The commenter is urged to raisethis issue with the appropriate State agency.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern with the appeal proceduredescribed in chapter 10 of the FMP to set aside in-season actions. He wantedto be certain that actions taken would be based on a written public record.<T3>Response: </T3>A written record of the appeal and the Secretary's finalaction will be made available for review by interested parties.<T3>Comment: </T3>The CIAC could delay the appeals process. The CIAC'scomments should be in writing and be made available to the public within30 days of making its recommendations.<T3>Response: </T3>The CIAC consists of the Regional Director of NMFS,the Commissioner of ADFandamp;G and the Director of the Washington StateDepartment of Fisheries or their designees. NOAA expects these membersto fulfill their responsibilities in a timely fashion. For in-season managementactions the Secretary allows CIAC five days for comment on an appeal. However,if the Secretary determines that there is not sufficient time availablefor this review, he will seek comments by telephone from the Commissionerof ADFandamp;G and from the Council.The CIAC's comments will be in writing and will be made available uponrequest.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned the fairness of informal hearingsprovided for by the FMP.<T3>Response: </T3>The purpose of informal hearings is to supplement therecord to increase the Secretary's knowledge of issues. NOAA believes theinformal hearings may be necessary before taking final action on any appeals.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned the FMP's prohibition againstbringing an in-season appeal of a State regulation that had been unsuccessfullyappealed preseason.<T3>Response: </T3>Controversy regarding the consistency of State regulationswith the FMP and applicable law must be put to rest promptly and finally,after full consideration of relevant issues. NOAA sees no need to allowan additional opportunity for in-season appeal of State regulations alreadydetermined to be consistent with the Magnuson Act, the FMP, and other applicableFederal law.<T3>Comment: </T3>A requirement which will advise the interested publicof the basis for rejection or acceptance of an appeal should be requiredby the FMP.<T3>Response: </T3>A written record of the notice and all public documentswill be available for review by interested parties.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended instituting a federally managedcrab FMP for both BS/AI and the GOA.<T3>Response: </T3>The Council considered several factors in determiningthe boundaries for the management unit. It noted that the stocks in theBS/AI are discrete from stocks in the GOA and that the physical environmenthas attributes that are distinguishable. It also noted that the fisheries,composition of resident and nonresident fishermen, the composition andmix of vessel size classes and portion of fisheries occurring in stateterritorial waters is different. One of the alternatives that the Council considered and ultimately rejectedwas a conventional federal crab FMP. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter would like the Board, the PNCIAC, and theCIAC to take the same oath of office as the Council members take. <T3>Response:</T3> Members of the Council's standing committees are notrequired to take an oath; only appointed Council members are. All appointedmembers of the Board do sign a State oath of office. NOAA does not believethat it is necessary for the members of the Board to take the same oathof office as the Council. <ITAG tagnum="84">Implementation of FMP </ITAG>No immediate Federal regulatory action is necessary to implement this FMP.The Secretary has preliminarily determined that existing State laws appearto be consistent with the FMP, the Magnuson Act, and other applicable Federallaw. The Secretary later may find that a State regulation or statute governingking or Tanner crab in the BS/AI is inconsistent with the FMP, the MagnusonAct, or other applicable Federal law, either as the result of an appealor the discretionary review of measures adopted by the Board provided forin the FMP. If necessary, he may publish a regulation in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> superseding such State regulation or statuteas it applies in the EEZ. <ITAG tagnum="84">Appeals to the Secretary </ITAG>Sections 9 and 10 of the FMP establish a procedure for interested membersof the public to appeal State of Alaska regulations and statutes to theSecretary. Appeals conforming to the criteria described in those sectionsmay be submitted in writing to the Regional Director, NOAA Fisheries, P.O.Box 21668, Juneau, Alaska 99802-1668. Appeals must set forth the reasonswhy the appellant believes the challenged regulations or statutes are inconsistentwith the FMP, the Magnuson Act, or other applicable Federal law, and mustinclude any supporting facts or documentation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Regional Director has determined that the Fishery Management Plan forthe Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the Bering Sea and AleutianIslands is necessary for the conservation and management of the BeringSea and Aleutian Islands crab fisheries, and that this FMP is consistentwith the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. A copy of the FMP may beobtained from the Council at the address above. The Council prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for this FMP. TheAssistant Administrator for Fisheries concluded that there will be no significantimpact on the environment as a result of FMP approval. A copy of the EAmay be obtained from the Council at the address above. Because this FMP requires no implementing regulations, 5 U.S.C. section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act, Executive Order 12291 and theRegulatory Flexibility Act do not apply to this notice of FMP approval.This FMP does not contain collection of information requirements subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Council determined that this FMP is consistent to the maximum extentpracticable with the approved coastal zone management program of Alaska.This determination was submitted for review by the responsible State agenciesunder section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act. The State agenciesfailed to comment within the statutory time period; therefore, State concurrenceis assumed. The Federalism Implementation Officer of the Department of Commerce hascertified that the policies in the FMP are consistent with the federalismprinciples, criteria, and requirements set forth in the sections 2 through5 of Executive Order 12612. A copy of the Federalism Assessment preparedfor this FMP may be obtained from the Regional Director, Alaska, at theaddress above. The Secretary approved the FMP on June 2, 1989, and determined that itis consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. Therefore,NOAA issues this notice announcing approval of the FMP.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
