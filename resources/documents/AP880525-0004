Dennis Jr.,President Reagan's choice to head the cirminal division of theJustice Department, is known for painstaking investigations thathave led to his winning convictions in racketeering and officialcorruption cases.   If Dennis, 43, is confirmed by the Senate as assistant attorneygeneral, the stint in Washington will be his second.   He was an assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia beforebecoming head of the narcotics section at the Justice Department'scriminal division in 1980. Reagan appointed him U.S. attorney inPhiladelphia on May 4, 1983, the first black to hold the post inthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania.   His office obtained convictions of more than 30 Philadelphiapolice officers, including the deputy police commissioner, onextortion and racketeering charges.   Dennis also handled the successful prosecution of NicodemoScarfo, the reputed head of organized crime in the Philadelphiaarea, and City Councilman Leland Beloff for trying to extort $1million from a developer to obtain City Council approval to build awaterfront development.   In five years as an assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia,Dennis lost only one case. He attributed his record to hismethodical style of preparation _ going over evidence again andagain, examining and re-examining witnesses until he was able to``anticipate every conceivable attack.''</TEXT></DOC>
