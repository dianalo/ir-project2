Pinellas Avenue,Suite andplusmin;5, Tarpon Springs, Florida 33589 proposing to deny any pendingapplications for registration as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f).The Order to Show Cause alleged that the registration of Respondent withthe Drug Enforcement Administration would be inconsistent with the publicinterest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f).By letter dated August 24, 1987, Respondent requested a hearing on theissues raised by the Order to Show Cause and the matter was docketed beforeAdministrative Law Judge Francis L. Young. Following perhearing procedures,a hearing was held on October 22, 1987, in Tampa, Florida. On February12, 1988, the Administrative Law Judge issued his opinion and recommendedruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision. No exceptionswere filed, and on March 18, 1988, Judge Young transmitted the record ofthese proceedings to the Administrator. The Administrator has consideredthe record in its entirety and pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67 hereby issueshis final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusionsof law as hereinafter set forth.The Administrative Law Judge found that on or about October 25, 1972, inthe United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania,Respondent was convicted of four counts of illicit sale and distributionof amphetamine, felony offenses relating to a Schedule II controlled substance.On or about December 14, 1972, in the United States District Court forthe Western District of Pennsylvania, Respondent was also convicted oftwo counts of willfully and knowingly failing to make an income tax returnin violation of 26 U.S.C. 7203. On or about April 27, 1981, in the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Kansas, Respondent was convictedof acquiring and obtaining possession of Schedule II non-narcotic controlledsubstances to be distributed and dispensed in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1),felony offenses relating to controlled substances. At the same time, Respondentwas convicted of 12 counts of causing controlled substances to be distributedand dispensed unlawfully by writing prescriptions in names other than thoseof the actual recipients of the prescriptions. As a result of these convictions,Respondent served about 45 days in Federal prison.In 1982, Respondent applied for a DEA registration at an address in Florida.An Order to Show Cause was issued by DEA proposing to deny that application.Respondent requested a hearing which was ultimately scheduled for February17, 1983, in Tampa, Florida. Govenrment counsel appeared at the hearing,however Respondent's counsel failed to show up. Thereafter, on September19, 1983, the then-Acting Administrator denied Respondent's applicationin a final order published in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>Volume 48, at page 43415 on September 23, 1983.In October 1982, while Respondent's 1982 application for registration waspending, the Pinellas County, Florida, Sheriff's Office initiated an investigationof Respondent's controlled substance handling practices after receivinginformation that Respondent was writing prescriptions for controlled substanceswithout being registered by DEA. The investigation revealed that Respondentdid, in fact, write prescriptions for controlled substances for variousindividuals knowing that he was not registered with DEA and, therefore,not authorized to write such prescriptions. As a result of this investigation,Respondent was convicted in a Florida State court on or about August 24,1983, after pleading <T3>nolo contendere </T3>to thirteen counts of sale or delivery of controlledsubstances in violation of the Florida Comprehensive Drug Abuse Preventionand Control Act, felony offenses relating to controlled substances.Respondent has submitted two applications for registration with DEA, onedated November 28, 1986, and the other dated February 26, 1987. These applicationsare the subject of these proceedings. The Administrative Law Judge concludedthat Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.Respondent has exhibited flagrant disregard for the laws relating to controlledsubstances. He has been convicted in three different states of controlledsubstance-related felonies over a period of eleven years.In addition, the Administrative Law Judge concluded that Respondent doesnot appear to have any real need for a DEA Certificate of Registration.A number of Respondent's patients testified on his behalf at the hearing.Most, if not all, of them stated that they have been very satisfied withthe professional care and treatment received from Respondent over the pastseveral years. During that period, Respondent was not registered with DEA.Also, during an interview conducted on February 6, 1987, Respondent tolda DEA Diversion Investigator that the only reason he was applying for DEAregistration was because he needed it to obtain hospital privileges. DEAdoes not register individuals to enable them to obtain hospital privileges.Registrations under the Controlled Substances Act are issued for one purpose_toenable the registrant to lawfully handle controlled substances.Based on his conclusion that Respondent's registration would be inconsistentwith the public interest, the Administrative Law Judge recommended thatRespondent's applications for registration be denied. The Administratoradopts the Administrative Law Judge's opinion and recommended ruling inits entirety. Respondent cannot be trusted to responsibly handle controlledsubstances.Accordingly, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration,pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that any pending applications for registrationunder the Controlled Substances Act submitted by Vincent A.
