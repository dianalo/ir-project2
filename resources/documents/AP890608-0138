U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene was given the Poindextercase in a two-paragraph order signed by Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson,who has been handling pre-trial proceedings involving Poindexter.   Robinson said in the order that he was handing the matter over toGreene because ``the case will be protracted and complex.''   Robinson also is handling pre-trial hearings in the Iran-Contracase of Richard Secord, who asked Robinson in a court sessionThursday not to consolidate a dozen criminal charges against himcontained in two separate indictments.   Assigning the Poindexter case to another judge is aimed at``expeditious and efficient dispostion of the court's business,''said Robinson.   Robinson has said it would be impossible for him to handle trialsinvolving both Poindexter and Secord.   Poindexter is charged in the Iran-Contra scandal with conspiracy,theft, wire fraud, two counts of obstruction of Congress and makingfalse statements to two congressional committees.   Greene, 66, has been handling the antitrust case involving theAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and its subsequent breakup since1978, the year Robert F. Kennedy on combating racial discrimination.   Robinson signed the two-paragraph order last Friday assigning thecase to Greene. Due to a clerical oversight, copies of the orderweren't made available to the public.   Meanwhile, Robinson said at a hearing that he will rule Fridaywhether to combine criminal charges that accuse Secord of lying toCongress to cover up personal profits in the Iran-Contra affair with1988 allegations that Secord slipped illegal gifts to Oliver L.North.   Thomas Green, Secord's attorney, argued against bringing the twosets of charges together. He said one of nine counts brought inApril, obstruction of Congress, is ``incredibly broad'' and willresult in a lengthy battle over the use of classified material.Prosecutors have said they plan to introduce no classified materialif Secord is tried on the consolidated charges.   Secord's lawyer urged Robinson to try Secord separately on thegratuities charges relating to North, a step the lawyer said wouldenable a trial in the next month or so.   At a previous hearing, Nov. 19 was mentioned by lawyers as apossible starting date for a trial on consolidated indictmentsinvolving Secord.   Secord's lawyer said charges involving the alleged lies toCongress don't relate to the counts involving illegal gratuities toNorth.   The judge said, however, that ``broad discretion'' is ``given totrial courts'' under federal rules allowing consolidation ofseparate indictments and that there doesn't need to be ``mechanicallinkage.''   The gratuities charges involve a $13,800 home security system forNorth and a $200,000 fund set aside for the education of hischildren.   North was convicted last month of accepting the security systemfrom Secord, along with falsifying and destroying documents andaiding and abetting in an obstruction of Congress. He will besentenced June 23.   North, then a White House aide, enlisted Secord to run arms tothe Contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the rebels.   The government is pressing to join the two sets of charges andplans to abandon wide-ranging conspiracy and theft counts accusingSecord of being involved in the diversion of Iran arms-sales profitsto the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   Identical conspiracy and theft charges against North were droppedbecause of national security concerns. The government refused todeclassify sensitive material that would have had to be presented incourt in a trial of those charges.</TEXT></DOC>
