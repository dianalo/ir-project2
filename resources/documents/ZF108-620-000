(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>BENCHMARK REPORT: SALES INCENTIVE PROGRAMS For years, software companies haverelied on a variety of sales incentive programs--especially co-op advertisingand market development funds (which provide resellers with extra promotionaldollars) and spiffs (which give small cash bonuses to individual reps)--toboost sales in the retail channel.andP;  Often, these programs have become socomplex that the special administrative guidelines, bookkeeping rules, andreimbursement forms can fill up a thick notebook that must be supplied toeach participating reseller.andP;  In addition, distributors now play a largerrole in managing some of these incentive programs, which adds a further levelof administrative complexity.andM;Moreover, the rhetoric level in discussions of sales incentives continues tobe unusually high.andP;  Resellers have been relentless in their demands forgreater spending by developers and publishers, sometimes asking for paymentsas high as 10%-15% of purchases and direct payment of the salaries ofin-store sales reps.andP;  Publishers have reacted with growing skepticism aboutthe value of these payments; WordPerfect's Pete Peterson, for example,recently argued that most incentive plans are merely &quot;bribes&quot; that rewardresellers for doing nothing more than filling orders.andP;  (At the same time,Peterson admitted that his own company uses incentive programsextensively--and successfully--when launching new products.)andM;As a result, it's been hard for developers and publishers to get a clearsense of current trends in the use of sales incentive programs.andP;  To shed somelight on this program, we recently surveyed our subscribers and our databaseof micro software developers and publishers about their use of salesincentives.andP;  By our June 15 cutoff date, we had received 215 usable surveyquestionnaires--slightly lower than our usual response rate, but enough todraw reasonably clear conclusions about industry trends.andP;  (However, some ofour more detailed questions yielded fairly sketchy data.andP;  Where appropriate,we've noted how many survey responses we used as the basis for analysis, soreaders can draw their own conclusions about the reliability of the data.)andM;The survey data we collected covers two major topics--market developmentfunds (MDF) and spiff payments.andP;  We also looked at various other salesincentives, such as prizes and sales contests, free software, and logo gifts,but we found no sinificant patterns--or even much use of these incentives.andM;MARKET DEVELOPMENT FUNDSandM;Usually, MDF and co-op money is accrued by resellers (particularlydistributors) based on a percentage of their purchases from the vendor.andP;  Weasked our respondent's whether they offer MDF programs, how much they spend,how they allocate funds to different categories of resellers, and whatreimbursement guidelines they impose.andM;Among our repondents, we found that MDF and co-op programs are relativelycommon, especially among companies above the $1 million level in sales:andM;Moreover, companies with active MDF and co-op plans seems to be spending asignificant amount of money on these programs--and many expect to increasethat level of spending during 1990.andM;In allocating market development funds, publishers frequently fine tune theirprograms for different classes of resellers.andP;  We asked our respondents tobreak out the percentage of invoice payments that they pay to variousresellers.andP;  The results suggest that distributors are the primarybeneficiaries of MDF and co-op funds; individual dealers, VARs, and othersaccrue funds at a higher rate (generally, 4%-5% of purchases), but they areless likely to buy directly from a publisher:andM;Finally, we looked at the guidelines that publishers impose on how funds arespent.andP;  Only a small number of publishers have completely unrestrictedprograms; the most common approach is to insist on advance approval for anyspending.andM;SPIFFSandM;Although spiff plans aren't quite as common as MDF programs, they are stillone of the industry's most popular methods for giving sales reps an extraincentive to push specific products.andP;  Spiffs typically are paid at two levelsin the distribution channel: to the distributor telemarketing reps whopromote products to dealers, and to dealer salespeople who sell to end users.andM;Our survey data highlights an important distinction between spiffs and MDFprograms: Spiffs tend to be offered only during special promotional periods,such as product rollouts.andP;  Relatively few companies maintain ongoing spiffprograms, which suggests that spiffs are most effective at producingshort-term sales spurts rather than sustained growth.andM;The actual value of a spiff payment tends to track closely the price of thesoftware title that is being sold; we found reports of spiffs as little as50c and as high as $50.andP;  When we looked at various reseller categories, wefound that the median value of spiffs to distributors and software-onlystores was $5, while the nedian for computer specialty stores and VARs was$10.andP;  This differences probably reflects the fact that distributors andsoftware stores tend to handle more lower-priced, mass-market titles, whiledevelopers of high-end titles are more likely to sell directly to specializedresellers.andM;Spiffs are primarily an incentive for individual sales reps, but someprograms allocate a portion of each spiff payment to management (or allowmanagement to control how these funds will be divided).andP;  When payments aresplit by the publisher, the median is 67% to the reps, 33% to management.andM;OTHER CORRELATIONSandM;In compiling this survey, we also collected data on such factors as productcategory, price, development platform, and total units shipped in 1989 todomestic resellers.andP;  This data can be used to look for more specializedcorrelations than we have provided here (though the data may not be adequatefor analysis that is substantially more detailed than our summaryconclusions).andP;  To help readers who want to explore narrower slices of ourdatabase, we have published the raw data from our questionnaires (excludingcompany names) in spreadsheet form.andP;  Copies of this spreadsheet may beordered from Soft*letter for $25 prepaid.andP;  Available disk formats includeLotus 1-2-3 (PC 5.25&quot; and 3.5&quot;) and Excel (Mac, PC 5.25&quot; and PC 3.5&quot;).andM;SLATE CORP. chairman Vern Raburn on why he recently helped launch a startupsoftware company that will specialize in pen-based applications: &quot;The PCbusiness was getting boring.andP;  Things like SQL, groupware, gateways--they'reimportant, and they' ll sell billions, but God, they're boring.&quot;andP;  (Quoted inPC Week, 4/23/90)andM;MEDIAGENIC chairman Bruce Davis on why he believes smaller developers willsoon be squeezed out of the Nintendo market: &quot;We're in a mature phase of thedevelopment of the market wher retailers tend to narrow the mix of productsthey offer and go with the top-selling titles because they get the bestprofits and the lowest risk.&quot;andP;  (Quoted in The New York Times, 4/29/90)andM;KLEINER, PERKINS partner John Doerr on the West Coast team's victory in thisyear's Computer Bowl: &quot;The defeat of unknown nerds from failing East Coastcompanies was inevitable.&quot;andP;  (Quoted in The Wall Street Journal, 4/30/90)andM;MICROSOFT vice-president of advanced operating systems Paul Maritz on theslow adoption rate of OS/2: &quot;Our early expectations were incorrect; we didnot do ourselves or the industry a service by setting those expectations.andP;  Weshould have realized that moving from DOC is a multilayered decision thattakes five to seven years to do.&quot;andP;  (Quoted in Computerworld, 4/30/90)andM;WORDTECH president David Miller on Ashton-Tate chairman Ed Esber's managementstyle: &quot;Esber was running a company that sells software as thought it wascoming out of a plastic injection molding machine.&quot; (Quoted in Computerworld,5/7/90)andM;MICROSOFT senior vice president Steve Ballmer on his company's decision tocreate an upgrade path from Windows to OS/2: &quot;OS/2 2.0 will be a superset ofthe next release of Windows.andP;  It would be great if 2.0 could run Windowsapplications--but that's a target, not a commitment.andP;  Binary compatibilitymight not appear until a later revision.andP;  But it will appear.&quot;andP;  (Quoted inInfoWorld, 5/7/90)andM;LOTUS senior vice president Frank Ingari on why his company hasn't been in ahurry to develop a Windows-based apreadsheet: &quot;It's only 5% of the market,but Windows creates 50% of the noise.&quot;andP;  (Quoted in Computerworld, 5/14/90)andM;MIT MEDIA LAB researcher Seymour Papert on why he believes videogame machineshave potential for educational applications: &quot;Children feel absolutelycomfortable with [video games].andP;  It's more than comfortable, it's a loveaffair.&quot;andP;  (Quoted in The Wall Street Journal, 5/15/90)andM;* POSTSCRIPT: Now that we've wrapped our latest survey on sales incentives,we've already under way with our next data collection effort--a comprehensivelook at the industry's sales compensation practices.andP;  This new survey isdesigned to do more than just document pay levels for various jobs: It willexplore the way software sales organizations have structured commission-basedcompensation, sales quotas, and other performance-based incentives.andP;  Werecognize that this is a difficult subject, but it's probably one of the mostimportant research projects we've ever undertaken.andP;  When you get our surveyquestionnaire in the mail, please take the time to fill it out carefully,with as much detail as you can provide.andP;  Many thanks.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
