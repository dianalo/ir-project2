(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Cuban immigrant protesting hisconviction on drug charges has been on a hunger strike since March 3.   Rene Acuna, 37, of Detroit, stopped eating after a Macomb CountyCircuit Court jury convicted him of conspiracy and delivery of 2pounds of cocaine. His sentence is life in prison without parole.   ``I've got honor. I've got dignity. I will be on a hunger strikeuntil I see justice in my case,'' he said in a telephone interviewfrom Duane L. Waters Hospital at the State Prison of SouthernMichigan at Jackson.   Living only on water and coffee with sugar, Acuna, who oncecarried 180 pounds on his 5-foot, 5-inch frame, had lost 64 poundsby Friday.   Acuna says he was convicted by an all-white jury solely becausehe was a Hispanic in a white neighborhood of Warren when anundercover agent bought cocaine from another Hispanic Aug. 12.   The prosecution argued Acuna was a lookout.   The Department of Corrections will go to court to get theauthority to force feed Acuna if his condition worsens, said DeputyDirector Leo Lalonde.</TEXT></DOC>
