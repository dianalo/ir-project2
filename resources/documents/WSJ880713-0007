The maker of machine tools and conveyer systems has experienced a series of troubles in recent months. It had a $2 million loss for its first half ended Sept. 30. Since last fall, its working capital and net worth -- or assets minus liabilities -- haven't been in compliance with its bank borrowing arrangements. Last month, the company's chairman resigned.    Acme officials refused to elaborate on a brief prepared statement, and referred questions to the company's attorney, who was unavailable for comment. The delisting action still requires official Securities and Exchange Commission approval. </TEXT></DOC>
