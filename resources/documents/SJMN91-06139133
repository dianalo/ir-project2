They hold Shiite rebels andcivilians who died in the failed March revolt against Saddam Hussein.;    Oneof a group of black-shrouded women carrying a thermos of water on her head inthe searing heat whispers as she passes by me, &quot;This government has alwayshated us Shiites.&quot; Looking at my interpreter she asks, &quot;Did you show hereverything? Is it dangerous to talk to her?&quot; Then with a nod she passes on bythe workers digging new graves.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Religion andamp; Ethics  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  REBELLION BRUTALLY CRUSHED, BUT THE HATREDWON'T GO AWAYSADDAM HUSSEIN SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE SHIITES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Islam  </MEMO><TEXT>     Karbala was where the rebels made their final stand. And Karbala's fateexplains why Saddam Hussein is unlikely to be challenged anytime soon byanother rebellion in the Shiite south.;    The road to Karbala is full ofsigns of the violence of March that spread like wildfire from Basra in theextreme south to most of the cities and towns of the region reaching within anhour's drive of Baghdad. The revolt sent shivers through the Sunni middleclass, and even through many well-to-do Shiites who feared that the rebels --mostly the urban poor -- would try to establish an Iranian-backed Islamicrepublic, or at least turn against the wealthier classes.;    &quot;They arecrazy,&quot; one Baghdad intellectual said fervently about the Shiite sect,contradicting the official line that there is no division between IraqiMuslims of different sects. Another Baghdad Sunni Muslim, horrified by thegovernment's tactics against the rebellion and still worried, said, &quot;They (theShiites) hate the Sunnis.&quot;;    Now the rebellion is history, but the woundsare fresh. The government is only beginning to replace the portraits of Saddamthat were ripped down from their central place at the entrance to each smalltown on the road south.;    At the town of Mahmoudiya, strung along thehighway, an Iraqi says bodies were brought from Karbala in open trucks anddriven around the town to frighten off potential rebels. At the entrance toKarbala farther south, huge swaths of date palms have been chopped down alongthe road. That was meant to destroy the hiding places of the insurgents.Soldiers are everywhere.;    Shopping district in shambles;  Light poles arecrazily askew. Houses along the road are charred. The central shoppingdistrict of Karbala looks like Beirut in its worst days, with missing glass,collapsed buildings, and merchants hawking tea and vegetables from small traysamid the rubble.;    Then two of the holiest mosques of the Shiite sect comeinto view. They are named for Hussein and Abbas, the sons of the ProphetMuhammad's son-in-law, who met their deaths in the historic battle of Karbalain 681 A.D.;    Hussein and Abbas fought a hopeless struggle over thesuccession to the Prophet and were crushed, splitting Islam into Sunni andShiite sects, and creating a veneration for martyrdom among the losingShiites.;    In March in Karbala, the lightly armed Shiite rebels, true totheir history, regrouped in the Hussein and Abbas mosques when defeat loomedand met another bloody end.;    Evidence of hatred;    The extent of theirhatred for Saddam's regime and the regime's determination to crush them isstill visible. Soldiers loll on an old couch in front of the Abbas mosque withcalendar photos of Saddam taped onto the entryway behind them. Black paint hasbeen smeared over anti-Saddam graffiti on the mosque walls.;    Just insidethe ruined entryway to the vast courtyard -- its wooden frame dangling infront of a burned chandelier, with bullet holes covering the walls -- is aside chamber of horrors. Once a guest room, with marble walls and beautifulwhite filigree ceilings, it has five nooses made of wire and electrical corddangling from empty chandelier hooks where rebels hanged local officials ofthe government they despised. Bloodstains mark the walls. Inside thecourtyard, solid gold doors to the tomb of Abbas are blasted by rockets andpocked with bullet holes.;    Bloody confrontations;  At the Hussein mosque,where the damage is even more horrifying, one soldier who was at the 10-daybattle says 3,000 soldiers died, more than the rebels who he says refusedappeals over a loudspeaker to surrender, forcing the army to storm themosques.;    Everything around the mosque -- blocks of stores, other mosquesand houses -- has been flattened by the army's artillery or blown up after thebattle. Soldiers say the government will raze the area but is unlikely torebuild, preferring to leave open spaces around these holy places of Shiitemartyrdom.;    Unclear who rebels were;  What is overwhelming about thesesights is the violent hatred that has caused this ruination. What is lessclear is who the rebels were. The government says they were led by Iranianswho infiltrated across the border. But Karbala is not near the border. Thesoldiers guarding these places say the rebels included some local people andalso some army deserters but still insist that the leadership came from Iran.;   Yet there is no question that the rebellion reflected a genuine anger onthe part of the population. People in Karbala are still frightened andreluctant to talk, and few young men can be seen on the streets, where thosewho walk about are mainly women enveloped in long black robes.;    Entire townangry;  But one government clerk whispered to me, &quot;All the people in the towndemonstrated because they were sick of war and Saddam began fighting wars fromhis first year in office.&quot; People were also angry at the high cost of living,he added.;    But he said that he didn't know who actually did the fighting,and he charged that the rebels were destroyers. He said they burned or lootedgovernment buildings and cars all over the south in an orgy of anger againstthe regime.;    The anger has been returned in kind. Hundreds of rebels werearrested, probably thousands killed. Artillery still sits trained on Karbalaand other towns, and army checkpoints block all the roads. &quot;It is impossiblethat this can happen again,&quot; the clerk says. For the foreseeable future, it iseasy to believe that he is right.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TRUDY RUBIN, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Karbala, Iraq  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910518  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,027  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday May 18, 199100139133,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
