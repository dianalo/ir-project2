The Japanese ship, Nisshin Maru No. 3, sustained minor damage toits hand rails while the Greenpeace ship Gondwana was not damaged,said Greenpeace spokesman Peter Wilkinson. There were no injuries,he said.   Wilkinson, speaking from the Gondwana by radio telephone, toldThe Associated Press the 1,435-ton Greenpeace ship was in a``perfectly legitimate position'' when the vessels collided.   In Sydney, Greenpeace's coordinator for Antarctica LynGoldsworthy said: ``The Japanese ship used an iron grappling hookand attached it to the Gondwana to pull it out of the way. In themaneuvering that resulted the Japanese boat collided with Gondwana.''   Immediately after the collision, Wilkinson said, there was aflood of communications between the skippers of both ships. ``TheJapanese told us to stay away and keep a distance of at least 300yards,'' he said.   Japan has said it plans to take 300 whales this year as part ofits scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks _despite a moratorium imposed by the International Whaling Commission.   Greenpeace contends most of the whale meat will end up in sushirestaurants in Japan.   In Tokyo, a whaling official said today that attempts by theenvironmental group to block Japanese ships from whaling in theAntarctic are endangering the lives of the crewmen and amount toterrorism.   ``This is terrorism, the same as that opposed by the UnitedStates and other countries,'' said Takehiro Takayama of theTokyo-based Japan Whaling Association. ``They have no concern abouthuman life.''   Wilkinson said that after the collision, the Gondwana, carrying acrew of 19, launched inflatable dinghies into the icy waters in aneffort to prevent the loading of harpooned whales onto the factoryship.   ``They then turned water hoses on us,'' he said. Wilkinson, aveteran of Antarctic expeditions, said the Greenpeace vessel laterchased several Japanese catcher ships whose crews were hunting forwhales with explosive harpoons.   He estimated that Japanese harpooners already have taken between50 and 55 Minke whales this season, about 10 of them since theGondwana caught up with the whaling fleet a week ago.   Wilkinson said Greenpeace would continue harassing the Japanesewhaling fleet for several more days. ``The whales don't belong tothe Japanese,'' he said. ``They belong to all of us.''</TEXT></DOC>
