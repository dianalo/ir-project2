Focus was on DEWbecause they would be needed in almost all stages of the destructionof a missile, including: detecting the launch; locating and trackingthe target; distinguishing warheads from decoys; and destroying the targetitself and verifying the kill. Results of the study were released inthe spring of 1987, and SDI partisans have attacked and SDI critics haveinvoked the findings of the APS committee. The authors were cochairmenof the 17-member committee, and here summarize their conclusions, namely:(1) although substantial progress has been made in many technologiesof DEW over the last two decades, significant gaps remain in these technologies;(2) successful resolution of these issues is critical for extrapolationto performance levels needed for an effective BMD systems; (3) at present,there is insufficient information to decide whether the required extrapolationscan be achieved; improvements of several orders of magnitude are needed;(4) under the best of circumstances, another decade of intensive researchis needed to provide the knowledge needed for an informed decision; and(5) important issues of overall system integration and effectivenessdepend critically upon information that does not yet exist.</TEXT></DOC>
