But the state's largest automobile insurer will go ahead with a9.6 percent rate increase charged to all of its auto insurancecustomers more than a month ago. The state Department of Insurancehas scheduled a hearing on the legality of the increase.   The refunds were announced Wednesday as a settlement of chargesby the department that State Farm had discriminated illegallyagainst new customers.   The company, which insures 2.8 million drivers in California,started assigning new customers to a higher-priced subsidiary, StateFarm Fire and Casualty Co., after Nov. 8, when voters approved therate-slashing Proposition 103 initiative.   State Farm Fire and Casualty charges 20 to 60 percent more thanState Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co., the ``preferred-risk''subsidiary.   It was the first increase by a major California insurer since thepassage of Proposition 103, which calls for a one-year rollback ofauto and property insurance rates to 20 percent cut below November1987 levels. The state Supreme Court has blocked the rollback whileit considers insurance company lawsuits claiming the initiative isunconstitutional.   The department contended State Farms' actions violated apre-Proposition 103 law forbidding arbitrary discrimination amonginsurance customers. State Farm said it had suffered largeunderwriting losses in California and was entitled to refuse newcustomers in any subsidiary as long as all customers were treatedalike.   The department said as many as 10,000 new customers were placedwith the higher-priced company. The details of the refund plan weredue in two weeks.   ``We're pleased with the results of our negotiations,'' saidInsurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie. ``Now the policy-holderswill get immediate action instead of seeing the issue drag throughcourts for years.''   James Mattesich, a lawyer for State Farm, said part of thesettlement was an agreement by the department that the company'sactions had been ``reasonable and consistent with prior regulatorypractice.''</TEXT></DOC>
