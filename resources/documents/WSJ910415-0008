Unitel Communications Inc., a joint venture of RogersCommunications Inc. and Canadian Pacific Ltd., is seeking tobreak the monopoly of Canada's regional phone companies inthe long-distance phone market. Unitel is promising customersits rates will be set at levels 15% below those of the phonecompanies.</LP><TEXT>   Canadians, especially businesses, eagerly await lowerrates. Most long-distance customers currently face chargesthat are an average of 40% higher than those paid by theirU.S. counterparts. In an example provided by Unitel, anAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. customer in Boston callingSeattle during business hours would pay C$1.26 for afive-minute call, but a five-minute call from Toronto toVancouver, a similar distance, costs the Toronto residentC$2.48.   &quot;With competition, we see productivity improving, themarket growing, and rates declining,&quot; said Michael Ryan, vicepresident and general counsel of Unitel.   But Bell Canada, a unit of BCE Inc., which provides phoneservice to more than half of all Canadians, says it canachieve substantial rate cuts and productivity gains withoutcompetition.   In fact, Bell claims that Unitel's plan will actuallylimit the size of rate reductions Bell is able to offer.Interconnecting Unitel's own long-distance lines withexisting Bell networks at the local level will cost Bell anadditional 3.9 billion Canadian dollars (US$3.39 billion)over 15 years, the phone utility says.   &quot;Unitel isn't proposing to cover the full costs ofinterconnecting with our system,&quot; said Richard French, vicepresident of regulatory affairs for Bell. Nor, he says, isthe would-be competitor willing to contribute enough to thesubsidy of local rates from long-distance revenues.   Bell spends a large portion of its revenue fromlong-distance phone calls to subsidize local rates. Unitelacknowledges that, in the first few years it plans tooperate, it won't pay as much as Bell toward the localservice subsidy.   &quot;Any country where competition has been introduced hasrecognized that a new entrant needs a reasonable period oftime to get on its feet,&quot; responds Unitel's Mr. Ryan, whosaid he expects the company to contribute more over time toboth the costs of interconnection and to local rates.   Canadians have had a glimpse of the type of debate likelyto take place before regulators, as Bell and Unitel havefought to press their views in the media and in regionalhearings.   Bell has challenged Unitel's business plan, calling itflawed and uneconomic.   &quot;We're touched by {Bell's} concern for our financialperformance,&quot; says Mr. Ryan of Unitel. &quot;But the business riskis a risk to be borne by our shareholders. As long as thecommission is convinced of our ability to pay the kind ofaccess charges they establish, we'd like to think they'dleave the issue of profits to the investors.&quot;   Bell also has announced, on several occasions, rate cutsfor long-distance service. Every time Bell announces a ratecut, Unitel has to recalculate its own rates to maintain itstarget of undercutting Bell by 15%. That reduces Unitel'smargins, and extends the period of time before it becomesprofitable.   Mr. Ryan calls Bell's planned and proposed rate cuts theresult of the threat of competition from Unitel. &quot;I believethat threat has to remain credible if all those promisedgains are to materialize,&quot; he said.   Both sides have turned for ammunition to the U.S.experience of deregulation. Bell points to the rise in localrates that followed competition in the long-distanceservices, but Unitel attributes that to the breakup of ATandamp;Tinto smaller phone companies, separate from long-distanceproviders, and to high inflation. Unitel, in turn, claimsthat competition increases the size of the long-distancephone market, a statement Bell disputes.   Hearings are expected to last until June. A final decisionfrom the Canadian Radio-television and TelecommunicationsCommission might not be disclosed until next spring.</TEXT></DOC>
