The judge selecting jurors to try North is making some progress,but the question arises: Will the jury that results be across-section of the community, capable of rendering an informedjudgment?   In the legal sense, it will be a jury of North's peers. The lawonly requires that it be a cross-section of citizens from which noone has been excluded by reason of sex, race or other arbitrarycriteria. It need not be people comparable to North in any other way.   What Judge Gerhard A. Gesell seeks is a jury ``ignorant'' ofNorth's activities _ people so removed from world affairs during thesummer of 1987 that they were unaware that North told Congress hehad lied to it, believing his duty to his country required suchdeception.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   House Speaker Jim Wright is moving to limitpolitical damage from an imminent 50 percent congressional pay raiseby offering a follow-up vote to roll the increase back to 30 percent.   Wright floated the idea of a follow-up vote on Wednesday, asHouse members nervous about the reaction back home to the 50 percentraise told news media and public interest groups that they wanted achance to reject it.   Wright's office said results of a private survey of lawmakerscould be released today, including whether members demanded a voteon the 50 percent raise that will become law next Wednesday unlessboth houses vote to stop it.   Senators are virtually certain to vote today or Friday to turndown the proposal to raise congressional pay from $89,500 to$135,000. House leaders initially planned not to hold any vote,letting the increase become law, but there were signs that resolvewas wavering on Wednesday.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Rep.

Brown counter complaints about his liberal ties andsmooth his transition to the chairmanship of the Democratic Party.

The huge C-5 plane was bound for the southern city of PuntaArenas, where its cargo and the 15-member team will be transferredto a U.S. research vessel, the Polar Duke, the U.S. Embassy inSantiago said.   In the Antarctic, U.S. scientists were trying to catch floatingoil barrels and propane containers near the spill, which was fourmiles in diameter and moving to the southwest, the National ScienceFoundation said.   The agency said in Washington that the Argentine supply vesselthat released the oil after it ran aground and sank had carried250,000 gallons of diesel fuel. It said an ``incurable disaster''would result if all the fuel leaks into the pristine region'sunspoiled waters.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists say they are certain that a naturalpoison caused the massive die-off of bottlenose dolphins in 1987 and1988, but they still are puzzled by the persistence of the deadly``red tide'' that arose in the Gulf of Mexico and moved up the EastCoast.   ``We have never found this before in history,'' said JosephGeraci, a wildlife specialist who headed a team of federalresearchers.   Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Geraci said laboratoryfindings confirm that the dolphins that died had eaten fishcontaminated with a powerful poison, called brevertoxin, originatingfrom the persistent bloom of red tide algae.   Gerald Scott, a federal fisheries expert, estimated that 50percent of the dolphins living off the coast were killed, and saidit could take 100 years for their numbers to recover.</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Love is in the air at two zoos wherescientists hope the world's last 28 California condors will matethemselves away from the brink of extinction, a biologist says.   Meanwhile, one of seven Andean condors freed into the wildernesschickened out of a dogfight with two golden eagles half her size.   ``We've got all sorts of great things happening with the Andeansand some equally exciting things happening with the captiveCalifornia condors. We're very encouraged,'' Joseph Dowhan, U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service condor recovery coordinator, saidWednesday.   Only 28 endangered California condors remain, 14 in captivity atthe Los Angeles Zoo and 14 others at the San Diego Wild Animal Parkin Escondido. Scientists hope the vulture-like creatures, which areNorth America's largest land birds with 9{-foot wingspans, willreproduce enough so that some can be returned to the wild in five to10 years.</TEXT></DOC>
