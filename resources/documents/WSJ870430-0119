The trouble with this skillful production is that when Mr. Williams isn't funny, he's twitchy.    Saturday, May 2, 4:30-6 p.m. EDT, on ABC: The Kentucky Derby. If this spectacle isn't galloping enough for you, tune in Saturday, May 9, same time and station, for England's Grand National Steeplechase.    Sunday, May 3, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;The Death of the Heart.&quot; An illegitimate orphan gets her warm blood chilled by elegant London relatives in this subtle adaptation of Elizabeth Bowen's novel. Much superior to next week's edition of &quot;Mobil Masterpiece Theatre&quot; (see below).    Sunday and Tuesday, May 3 and 5, 9-11 p.m EDT, on CBS: &quot;A Murder Ordained.&quot; Can adultery and murder still shock? Maybe -- if committed by a minister in a small town in Kansas. This fact-based miniseries stars the interesting Keith Carradine as a highway patrolman who suspects the worst.    Tuesday, May 5 and continuing through midsummer, on CNN: Gavel-to-gavel coverage of the joint hearings of the House and Senate Select committees on the Iran/contra affair.    Saturday, May 9-Monday, June 8, (check local listings), on PBS: &quot;Pacific Rim.&quot; For five consecutive programs, &quot;Adam Smith's Money World&quot; focuses on the emergent economic leadership of Japan and the four &quot;little tigers.&quot;    Sunday, May 10, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: &quot;A Gathering of Old Men.&quot; Lou Gossett Jr. and Richard Widmark star in this story of a group of elderly black Louisianans asserting their dignity. The novel by Ernest J. Gaines, author of &quot;The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,&quot; was adapted for TV by Pulitzer Prize winner Charles Fuller, author of &quot;A Soldier's Story.&quot;    Sundays, May 10 and 17, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Love Song.&quot; A few more productions like this one, based on an inane fiction by Jeremy Archer, and this series will have to be renamed &quot;Mobil Schlock Theatre.&quot; If you miss the fine Ernest Gaines story listed above for this imported drivel, then you've let Anglophilia fool ya.    Sunday and Monday, May 10-11, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: &quot;Hands of a Stranger.&quot; Besides, some of our home-grown schlock keeps getting better! Playwright Arthur Kopit wrote this wickedly fast-paced adaptation of Robert Daley's best seller about a policeman investigating his wife's rape.    Sunday and Monday, May 10 (9-11 p.m.) and 11 (8-11 p.m.), on ABC: &quot;Queenie.&quot; Other schlock never improves. See the latest sexy young thing, Mia Sara, display her wares in this miniseries version of Michael Korda's pulp sizzler.    Monday, May 11, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Charley's Aunt,&quot; on &quot;American Playhouse.&quot; Be patient with this 100-year-old warhorse while it sets up its farce. Once Charles Grodin puts on his Spanish dowager duds and starts hamming it up, you'll be helpless with laughter.    Tuesday, May 12, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: &quot;The Dumb Waiter.&quot; Yes, it's really that absurdist Harold Pinter play you sat through in college. Only now it stars Tom Conti and John Travolta as the two hoodlums gazing into the abyss.    Wednesday, May 13, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;The Mormons: Missionaries to the World.&quot; A surprisingly evenhanded treatment of both the rewards and the disappointments of the Latter Day Saints' global missionary program. </TEXT></DOC>
