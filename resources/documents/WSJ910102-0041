Iraq's invasion of Kuwait came as many of the world'simportant economies were slowing. Once concern over oilsupplies was eliminated by increased production and reduceddemand, a malaise spread through commodity markets.</LP><TEXT>   Gold, the supposed haven in time of crisis, brieflyreacted to the Mideast tensions. Slower industrial demandaffected other metals, though copper remained above $1 apound. Grain and soybean prices fell as highly favorablegrowing conditions swelled output.   Most other commodities showed little change. Exceptionswere cotton, for which demand was strong; orange juiceprices, which shot up after a devastating Christmas 1989frost; and livestock and meat, because production was cutback.                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          For oil prices, 1990 was a more erratic year than most.   At one point in October, the price of crude on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange had jumped more than 100% from thestart of the year, climbing to more than $40 a barrel. Just afew months earlier, prices were below $20 and oil companieswere fearing another sustained price crash.   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 was the oilmarket's milestone of 1990. Until then, prices had beenfalling through most of the year as the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries again seemed unable todiscipline its production, pumping more oil than its officialquotas.   After Aug. 2, fears of supply disruptions and actualshortages propelled a buying frenzy that was fed by everyrumor that war was imminent. The world embargo of Iraqi crudeby consuming nations combined with the loss of Kuwaitiproduction created an instant shortage of more than fourmillion barrels a day.   But the 11 other OPEC countries, led by Saudi Arabia,surprised everyone by increasing production to the point thatthe shortfall virtually disappeared. With oil inventories inthe Western world at high levels and demand starting tosoften in the face of budding recession, prices started tocome off their highs. By year end, oil prices were well below$30 a barrel.   As 1991 begins, traders say, prices will continue to boband weave with every indication of peace or war in thePersian Gulf. War would likely send prices soaring, at leastinitially. Estimates of how high and long vary widely becauseit is impossible to predict the extent of supply disruptionsor damage to Mideast oil fields, if any. Many guess oil couldgo quickly to $60 a barrel with war.   But a peaceful resolution -- either with or without war --is then expected to cause a price crash. Iraq and Kuwaitwould want to sell oil again, while Saudi Arabia, Venezuela,the United Arab Emirates and others that boosted volume inthe crisis would presumably be reluctant to cut output. Theresult could be an oil glut. Prices could sink as low as $10to $15 a barrel initially, analysts believe, before rising tothe low-$20 range.                                                                                                          Grains andamp; Soybeans                                                                                                          Prices of most major U.S. crops sank in 1990 because theworld's weather was unusually good. Global production ofwheat and rice set a record. Outside the U.S., the productionof coarse grains such as corn also set a record.   The prices of most U.S. crops will probably be sluggishearly this year as big trade partners such as the SovietUnion and China rely more on their own farmers and reduceU.S. purchases.   But the seeds for a price recovery are being plantedbecause fewer acres are being sown in many countries.Government moves to ward off burdensome stockpiles areprompting U.S. wheat farmers to plant roughly 9.5% feweracres. Brazil, one of the largest soybean-producing nations,is seeing its acreage slip 14%.   Soybean stockpiles are lean and demand for U.S. soybeanexports are expected to remain relatively stable. Corn pricesmay rally early this year if the Soviet Union makes anysurprise purchases. Wheat prices are expected to remain weakat least until prospects for the summer harvest become clear.                                                                                                          Livestock andamp; Meats                                                                                                          Cattle prices are expected to hit a plateau this yearafter climbing for two years to record levels.   Bob Price, assistant vice president for livestock atCargill Investor Services Inc., said he expects prices torange from 75 cents to 85 cents a pound this year.   Cattle prices are high in part because their numbers areat the lowest levels since the 1960s and ranchers have beenslow to expand. Drought-damaged pastures in 1988 and 1989forced many ranchers to trim their herds even though consumerdemand for beef was strengthening.   Some traders are reasoning that a recession would coolconsumer demand for beef and prompt shoppers to buy cheapermeats such as poultry. Economic uncertainty is alsoconvincing many ranchers to continue to keep a tight rein onthe size of their cattle herds. Thus, beef supplies willprobably remain lean this year and help to keep the consumerprice high.   Hog farmers have also kept a tight lid on their herds,which helped to push hog prices to record levels this pastspring.   Hogs, however, reproduce faster than cattle, so farmerstend to expand their hog herds more quickly in the wake ofhigh prices. As a result, the U.S. hog population is alreadyexpanding and prices are generally expected to trail 1990levels.   Mr. Price of Cargill Investor Services said hog priceswill probably range from slightly less than 45 cents a poundto slightly more than 60 cents.                                                                                                          Precious Metals                                                                                                          Disappointment described the 1990 precious metals markets.Even with a genuine war scare, an increase in inflation, anda Congress unwilling to rein in spending, gold fell $9 anounce from the beginning of the year, silver dropped 19%, andplatinum investments eased $78 an ounce.   Tom Griffo, precious metals analyst at Cargill InvestorServices, argues that gold's status as a haven investment hasbeen overrated. And silver, he says, is in its most bearishstate since the mid-1970s. William O'Neill, futuresstrategist at Merrill Lynch in New York, says the Soviets,because they need hard currencies, are likely to continue tobe big sellers of gold and platinum this year.   But James Dines, editor of the Dines Letter, says that assoon as the recession lifts this year, gold and the otherprecious metals will increase in price with the renewedinflation. He also notes that recent announcements of theclosing of some silver mines are very encouraging, signalingthe market has nearly hit bottom.                                                                                                          Copper                                                                                                          Until the summer of 1990, copper lacked direction, tradingfrom under $1 a pound to just over that level. In earlyAugust, copper traders became focused on the Middle Eastcrisis.   Mideast uncertainty contributed to the slowing of someindustrialized economies, particularly in North America, withthe perception that copper demand would slump as theautomobile and housing industries sagged.   But with demand from Asia remaining constant, a majorprice break for copper isn't expected in 1991. And if theeconomy recovers as anticipated in late 1991, analysts said,copper prices should move higher.                                                                                                          Cotton                                                                                                          The U.S. cotton market benefited from strong demand bothdomestically and overseas, driving cotton prices to 77 centsa pound by early July. Sharon Johnson, cotton analyst forCargill Investor Services in Atlanta, says cotton wasaffected last year by the highest rate of consumption in 25years.   Thomas Mueller, cotton specialist at Merrill Lynch in NewYork, foresees strong demand both domestically andinternationally in 1991. He says that at the end of the cropyear in July supplies will be tight both here and abroad,which will help buoy prices at least until the harvest in thefall. But Mr. Mueller asserts that profitability for cottonmills will go to zero if the price of cotton rises above 80cents a pound. He adds &quot;prices higher than that will alsocause demand to fade away.&quot;                                                                                                          Orange Juice                                                                                                          Orange juice futures had a year of extremes. Prices shotup to more than $2 a pound because of a freeze in December1989. The high prices produced a drop in demand that, inturn, caused prices to start to fall. Adding to that collapsewas a government announcement of an unexpectedly largeFlorida crop.   Judith Ganes, senior commodities research analyst forMerrill Lynch, said retail prices must match the drop inwholesale prices before demand picks up. &quot;Barring severefreezes, I expect prices to slip down under $1 a pound andperhaps even go under 85 cents,&quot; she said.   But late last month, an Arctic wave frosted the West Coastas low as Southern California there, destroying most of thecitrus crop. Most of California oranges are sold for freshconsumption, but now many of the damaged oranges will beprocessed for juice, adding an unexpected increase to thealready large supply produced by Florida.   Celeste Georgakis, juice analyst with Cargill InvestorServices Inc. in New York, sees the market slowly turningaround but is looking for a bumper crop from Brazil. &quot;I seethe surplus of juice continuing,&quot; she says. Any recovery injuice prices, according to Ms. Georgakis, will have to waitfor the second half of the year unless freezing weather againstrikes the Citrus Belt.   &quot;With the ideal growing conditions Brazil had this year,we believe it's very likely that Brazil's first 300million-box crop will occur in the 1991-92 season,&quot; saysBernard Savaiko, senior commodities analyst at PaineWebberInc. But he adds that he expects the Florida crop to retrenchabout 10% to 148.5 million boxes in the season. Even with thesmaller crop, Mr. Savaiko says that if the deflationaryjitters continue to permeate the commodities markets, juicecould decline to the 80-cent level.   Sugar                                                                                                          Sugar prices came under increasing pressure last year asthe industry moved from a supply deficit in 1989-90 to asurplus in 1990-91. Expectations are for another surplusyear. However, the overproduction isn't anticipated to bethat great and reserve supplies are somewhat small.                                                                                                          Cocoa                                                                                                          Futures prices ended higher. Prices ran up sharply in lateMay when there was concern over dry weather in the IvoryCoast, the world's largest cocoa producer, and in other WestAfrican countries.   The Ivory Coast's presidential election also unsettled themarket because traders feared a possible revolution thatcould disrupt shipments.   However, the weather turned favorable, and there waslittle violence, resulting in normal cocoa exports.   A few months later, prices rose in expectation ofpurchases by the Soviet Union, but then fell when the Sovietsencountered credit problems and canceled purchases.   Nevertheless, cocoa prices managed to retain some of theirgains on concern that high-quality cocoa beans would be inrelatively tight supply into the beginning of this year.                                                                                                          Coffee                                                                                                          The coffee market remained depressed by heavy andunlimited exports of coffee and a large buildup of stocks inconsuming countries. Exporting countries were able to shipwithout restrictions after the International CoffeeAgreement's export quota system collapsed in July 1989. In1991, however, there will be growing concern over theavailability of better quality Arabica coffees as demandincreases.</TEXT></DOC>
