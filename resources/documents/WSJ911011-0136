He did all of this under the supervision of hisboss, an admiral, and with the conviction that the presidentwas aware of and condoned his unlawful activities. Whathappened to his oath as an officer not to obey unlawfulorders?   Your readers will find it easy to imagine your indignationhad any of this happened during the Carter years. It isespecially ironic that you fail to see the parallel ofrighteous arrogance in the similar usurpation of power aspracticed in totalitarian regimes.</LP><TEXT>   Instead, you belittle one of this country's safeguardsagainst the abuse of power by the executive branch: the useof the independent prosecutor -- made necessary by executivebranch scandals such as Watergate and Iran-Contra. By reverselogic, you compare this safeguard to a Communist Gulag.   Ollie North can be grateful for the immunity granted forhis confessions before Congress and the meticulous fairnessof the courts that resulted in his convictions beingoverturned and a re-trial abandoned. Without that immunity,he would still face punishment for his admitted crimes.   It would be refreshing to read an editorial concerned withthe truly conservative principles of defending theConstitution against subversion from any source.   Phillips B. Jankus   New Orleans   ---   Oliver North admitted on national television that he liedto Congress and shredded embarrassing documents as thescandal came to light. Unless one believes the executivebranch should be free to operate above the law, Col. Northcertainly deserved to be prosecuted.   The notion -- perpetuated in numerous Journal editorialson Iran-Contra -- that the case against Col. North wassomehow frivolous deeply offends those of us who takeseriously the constitutional checks on abuses of executivepower.   John Henry   New York   ---   When Lawrence Walsh decided not to go further in the case,Col. North was not &quot;totally exonerated;&quot; he simply &quot;beat therap.&quot; Crime figures may boast and strut about when they &quot;beatthe rap.&quot; It seems hardly appropriate for you and Col. Northto do the same.   Jack Eber   New York</TEXT></DOC>
