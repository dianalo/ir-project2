Much of the damage in Michigan was confined to Washtenaw Countysouthwest of Detroit, where a funnel cloud touched down four timesSunday afternoon along a 13-mile path, said Dan Harsh, the countyemergency management director.   The National Weather Service confirmed three other tornadoes insoutheast Michigan, meteorologist Tom Fendon said.   More than two dozen homes and several barns were damaged by thefour twisters, along with trees and utility poles, officials said.   A funnel cloud and golfball-size hail were reported late Sundayafternoon in the Washtenaw County community of Manchester, but thetwister apparently did not touch down, Fendon said.   The storm system also produced severe thunderstorms elsewhere inthe state's Lower Peninsula. Traverse City, Houghton Lake and GrandRapids each received about 1 inch of rain, while wind gusts reached63 mph near Ann Arbor, the weather service said.   About 9,000 customers lost electrical service during the storm,utility officials said.   Detroit Edison Co. spokesman Dan Vecchioni said only about 400customers remained without power today, and service to them wasexpected to be restored by evening.   In Louisiana, partly cloudy skies and 80-degree weatherpermitted a continued cleanup Sunday by victims of a tornado andfloods that accompanied a torrential weekend rain.   Southeast Louisiana was waterlogged by more than a foot ofprecipitation. Rain-swollen rivers and streams continued to crestabove flood stage, but officials said the flooding would beconfined mostly to rural areas.   Hardest hit by flooding were the suburban subdivisions inMarrero, across from New Orleans on the west bank of theMississippi River.   But Tony Rodi, coordinator for emergency management in JeffersonParish, said streets hip-deep in water on Saturday were dry bySunday, and power was restored to nearly all the houses.   Rodi said no official count was available on the number of homesthat were flooded Saturday. The Red Cross said about 200 peoplewere evacuated Saturday; about 70 were in an emergency shelterSunday.   On the other side of Lake Pontchartrain, residents in Slidellcontinued to clean up from a tornado Saturday that the state Officeof Emergency Preparedness said destroyed three homes, caused majordamage to 17 others and minor damage to 32 more.</TEXT></DOC>
