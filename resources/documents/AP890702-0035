The warship steamed past the activists and sailed into theStockholm harbor.   ``The cruiser signaled with its horns, and police in small boatstried to pick our people up from the water, but didn't succeed,''Greenpeace spokesman Magnus Furugard said.   Two hours earlier, police boarded and confiscated the Greenpeacevessel Moby Dick and arrested the eight activists on board oncharges of planning a sabotage action, Furugard said.   ``We did not plan anything criminal. We carried out ademonstration,'' Furugard said. ``It's a crime to bring in nuclearweapons, and a crime to spread nuclear weapons.''   The Swedish government forbids foreign ships to bring nuclearweapons into its waters, but it assumes that the prohibition will berespected and does not question visitors.   The U.S. Navy refuses to confirm or deny whether a particularship carries nuclear weapons.   Greenpeace announced Friday it was planning a peaceful action toprotest the visit of the cruiser, which the organization saidnormally carried nuclear weapons.   ``The government has failed in its duty to stop the spread ofnuclear weapons in the world,'' Furugard said.   The U.S. ship was scheduled to stay in Stockholm two days.</TEXT></DOC>
