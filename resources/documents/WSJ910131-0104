One can only speculate, of course, on whether George Bushand the late Huey Newton shared a patch of common ideologicalground. The fact remains that talk of &quot;power&quot; -- who gets itand how -- has returned to the political debate, a debate nowled by a Republican President and a tong of Young Turk aidesin the White House who call their idea &quot;empowerment.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Defining who's in the debate is easy. It's everyone excepttraditional American liberals; they're out of it. While stillable to mount guerrilla raids against the movement'slegislation, the Ted Kennedys, George Mitchells and PeteStarks are on the intellectual sidelines (Mario Cuomo, ofcourse, will manage to talk his way past the guards).   President Bush, in his State of the Union speech, definedthe principle that serves as a minimum entry requirement:&quot;The strength of democracy is not in bureaucracy.&quot; If youdon't believe that, you might as well turn the page.   Since Lyndon Johnson's salad days, traditional, bipartisanliberalism has carved out a bureaucratic Mount Rushmore: theDepartment of Health and Human Services, the Department ofHousing and Urban Development, the Department of Education,Medicare/Medicaid, various subdivided organisms off the mainstem and biological analogs in almost every statehouse andcity hall across the land. America today is engulfed withrules, regs and laws administered by public employees.   Whatever their original intentions, mainstream liberalsbecame bureaucrophiliacs -- a person who has an abnormal lovefor bureaucracies. Bureaucrophilia manifests itself by thehabit of forcing funds through appropriation tubes to anyextant bureaucracy no matter if it's good, bad, old, failed,redundant or dead.   Mr. Bush wants to turn government away from liberalism's50-year model of doing good with large administrativebureaucracies and toward a newer system that emphasizesindividuals who make, and bear responsibility for, their ownchoices. Thus the ideas of school choice, preventive healthcare, enterprise zones and tenant control or ownership ofpublic housing.   There will be much to argue about in the details forconservatives, neo-liberals, Pinkertonian libertarians andtechnocratic Darmanians. That word &quot;empowerment,&quot; forstarters, connotes a benevolent central government bestowingpower-with-strings on poor people, rather than eventuallydivesting itself altogether of power over their lives. Mr.Bush never said &quot;empower&quot; in his speech, perhaps recallingits odd communitarian echo from the '60s.   There is also the practical matter of winning and holdingconstituencies. Traditional liberalism's constituency remainswide enough to ensure congressional incumbency but too weakto win the presidency. Radical conservatives are hoping towin political loyalty by handing over power to people whomight in turn vote more of them into Congress or statelegislatures; it is a constituency that Republicans nevermuch cared about. Now some of them do. The battle is joined.</TEXT></DOC>
