Barnes and Daniel AkstStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GE LABORTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   National Broadcasting Co. is girding for its first strike in more than a decade.    Barring a last-minute development, about 2,800 members of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians employed by NBC will walk off their jobs when the network implements its &quot;final offer&quot; contract at 12:01 a.m. EDT Monday.    New York-based NBC and its two rivals, as well as Hollywood's major studios, also face a possible strike by 8,500 members of the Directors Guild of America who will vote next week on proposed contracts. NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, employs about 160 full-time guild members and about 7,500 people overall.    Both possible union confrontations come amid continuing efforts by the networks and the studios to cut and contain costs.    Officials of NBC and the union, which last struck NBC for seven weeks in 1976 and represents mainly engineers and news employees at the network, said that as of late yesteday they hadn't scheduled any new contract negotiations.    The two sides remain far apart on issues such as NBC's demand for greater use of temporary employees, the length of the new contract and the union's demand for a four-day workweek. NBC plans to implement a two-year contract replacing a four-year agreement that expired March 31.    &quot;Unless the company rescinds the implementation, there is going to be a strike,&quot; John Krieger, a union spokesman, said. &quot;The company has really dug in.&quot;    The union had accused the network of unfair labor practices in a complaint filed April 20 with the National Labor Relations Board, but yesterday the board dismissed the complaint. Among other things, the union claimed NBC refused to negotiate, failed to address union proposals and proposed a change in the definition of employees within the union's bargaining unit.    Day Krolik III, NBC's vice president, labor relations, said the network is &quot;extremely well prepared&quot; for a strike. He said NBC managers have been training to replace striking workers for about six months. Referring to any possible renewed talks with the union, he said, &quot;We have nothing more to tell them.&quot;    Mr. Krieger acknowledged the network will be able to continue operating for some time in a strike. But among other things, the union may try to disrupt NBC's news-gathering operations, for one, with pickets at network and local station news events. &quot;Where NBC is out covering the news, we'll be there,&quot; he said.    Directors Guild and movie-industry sources said a guild strike also appears likely. &quot;If the (producers') demands are the same June 30 as they are today, we will strike,&quot; the guild's president, Gilbert Cates, said. Guild members will vote on final offers from both the producers and the networks on July 1 and 2.    The guild talks are being watched closely in Hollywood because a strike would cripple production, and because any agreement with a major union such as the guild probably would be precedent-setting for other entertainment unions.    Mr. Cates said talks with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which is dominated by the major Hollywood studios, are stalled on the issue of residuals, the payments directors receive for subsequent showings of their work. Nicholas Counter, president of the alliance, also acknowledged that the two sides are stuck on the residuals question and that both sides have prepared for a strike.    Citing soaring production costs, the producers want to cut residuals by paying them only when a movie or TV program shows a profit, but the guild says it would be too easy to conceal profits, and thus eliminate the payments. The rise of videocassettes and cable television has made these residual-generating ancillary markets increasingly important.    &quot;Our proposals are designed to make the collective bargaining contract reflect the present-day economics of the market place,&quot; Mr. Counter said.    But one studio executive said privately that the directors' talks are likely to mark the beginning of an effort to reduce labor expenses across the board by attacking costly work rules and other practices.    ---   NBC to Sell 3 Radio Outlets   NEW YORK -- National Broadcasting Co. plans to sell three of its eight radio stations, company officals said.    In a memo to employees, NBC radio officials said the company, a General Electric Co. unit, will sell WKYS-FM, Washington; WMAQ-AM, Chicago, and KNBR-AM, San Francisco.    The officials said also it will seek &quot;strategic alliances&quot; for its network-radio operations. They declined to be specific.    As previously reported, NBC radio recently completed a review of its operations that will result in a &quot;reconfiguration&quot; that also may include the purchase of new radio stations. </TEXT></DOC>
