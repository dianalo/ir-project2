The larger charge, an estimated $740 million before taxes, willbe taken as part of a plan to integrate newly merged businesses andreorganize on a worldwide basis.   It will cover the costs of reducing the number of plants andemployment levels. It also will be used to pay for employeerelocations and related expenses, the company said in a newsrelease. A company spokesman said a small percentage of the workforce will be cut but exact numbers were not yet known.   There will be an additional fourth-quarter charge of $115million for the costs of professional fees and other expensesrelated to last year's merger of the formerly separate companiesBristol-Myers and Squibb.   The union was completed in October after stockholders approvedan $11.5 billion tax-free stock swap between the two companies,creating the second largest pharmaceutical concern behind Merck andamp;Co.   The two charges will reduce after-tax income by about $690million, the company estimated.   Financial results for the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31,are due to be released later this month. Company spokesman DanMcIntyre said he couldn't say whether the charges would causeBristol-Myers Squibb to report a loss for the fourth quarter.   The two predecessor companies had combined profit of $1.1billion, or $2.10 a share, through three quarters of 1989. That wasup 14.4 percent from $961.5 million, or $1.83 a share, in the firstnine months of 1988. Combined sales totaled $6.8 billion, up 6.5percent from $6.4 billion in 1988.   Chairman Richard L. Gelb said Bristol-Myers Squibb is on the wayto realizing the benefits of the merger that was announced in July.   He said the coordination of sales and marketing activities andthe performance of the combined pharmaceutical research anddevelopment effort promised to fulfill the business opportunitiesthat were anticipated.   Bristol-Myers Squibb expects that savings from joiningadministrative and manufacturing functions will provide resourcesto invest in various businesses and to help offset the per-shareearnings dilution that the merger caused, Gelb said.   McIntyre, a company spokeswoman at the New York headquarters,said the extent of the employment cuts hasn't been determined yet.The company has about 53,000 employees.   He said it was anticipated that reductions would amount to asmall percentage of the work force.   A freeze on new hiring has been in place since the merger wasannounced over the summer.   Bristol-Myers makes Excedrin and Bufferin pain relievers,household products and numerous prescription medicines.   Squibb makes and markets a wide variety of prescription drugsand has an extensive research and development operation.</TEXT></DOC>
