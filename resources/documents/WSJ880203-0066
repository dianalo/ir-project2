It tastes delicious and has practically no calories. The meal, nutritionists agree, does no great harm.    It also does no good.    That futuristic vision may not be too far off, as big food companies race to come up with new products that they promise will not only taste great, but also let all Americans have bodies like fashion models. Just last week, NutraSweet Co. announced a new fat substitute, Simplesse, which it hopes will clear regulatory approval and be on the market in the next year or two. Another fat substitute -- Procter andamp; Gamble's Olestra -- may not be far beyond. And Aspartame, the artificial sweetener sold by NutraSweet, a subsidiary of Monsanto Co., already commands a large market.    Increasingly, however, nutritionists are peering into the dark side of this promised revolution in the American diet. Nobody yet understands the full implications of these products. But nutritionists fear a world where diets of synthetic foods exacerbate our worst eating habits. And researchers caution that the long-term health effects of these new products are unknown.    &quot;The food industry is developing synthetics and conquering nature,&quot; says Joan Gussow, professor of nutrition at Teachers College in New York. &quot;We're severing our contact with nature and that's dangerous.&quot; Still, she says, it's a trend that's hard to fight. &quot;We as a society have a lust for the taste of fat,&quot; she says.    It's a lust that is intense. Consumers want to satisfy their taste buds while cutting calories. Simplesse, for instance, has 1 1/3 calories per gram, compared with nine calories for fat. Thus, a butter substitute made with the new product would have only eight calories per tablespoon vs. 36 for butter or margarine. Pandamp;G's Olestra wouldn't have any calories.    Moreover, many people are starting to expect science to cure the problems they cause for themselves at the dinner table. &quot;We're all into popping a pill after we eat to stop the damage,&quot; says Bonnie Liebman, a nutritionist in Washington, D.C.    Little wonder, then, that food companies envision a synthetic-food market worth billions of dollars. They are holding their breath, hoping that the Food and Drug Administration doesn't find that any of the products produce side effects in lab testing on rats.    But even if the rats thrive, nutritionists have plenty of concerns.    The first is that it may kill much of the incentive people have for eating well. The inevitable intense marketing of the fat substitutes will focus consumer attention on such foods as ice cream, cookies and potato chips. If people think they can eat all they want of such foods with little risk, many are likely to skip their carrots and spinach, nutritionists say. Yet a proper diet consists of taking the appropriate vitamins and minerals, they say; it isn't what's left out.    &quot;There's the hazard that in some people's minds, unhealthy foods will be transformed into healthy foods,&quot; says Kelly Brownell, co-director of the obesity clinic at the University of Pennsylvania. &quot;It's going to hurt if people replace vegetable calories with ice cream calories,&quot; he says.    Adds Walter Mertz, an FDA nutritionist: &quot;Let's say the good side of this stuff is it lowers cholesterol if used prudently. It may also make people forget their diets.&quot;    The effect may be even more harmful than that; it also may give people an excuse to further indulge in foods that aren't good for them. Nutritionists say that's partly because the fat substitutes won't eliminate people's desire for the normal amount of regular fat that their bodies are used to.    &quot;The tongue can be fooled but the body still wants its calories,&quot; says Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group. &quot;People who use the substitutes will say, 'Now I have eaten something healthy. I can loosen up.'&quot;    As evidence, nutritionists point to the increase in sugar consumption as artificial sweeteners have been introduced. Per-capita consumption of sugar has risen 14% to 129.8 pounds since 1965. Meanwhile, artificial sweetener use has more than tripled.    Artificial sweeteners have merely sharpened the consumer's sweet tooth, some critics say. &quot;I put aspartame in my coffee and then eat apple pie. A lot of us look forward to our diet drink and our ice cream on the side,&quot; says Yolanda Wesely, a sociologist in New York.    Researchers are also concerned that the new products may not only keep consumers from eating vitamin-enriched foods; the products actually may even flush vitamins out of the body.    David Hattan, chief of regulatory affairs for food at the FDA, says he is concerned about a fat substitute, now under testing, that isn't absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract. &quot;Vitamins could be passed right out of the body without being absorbed,&quot; he says. &quot;People could starve to death on this kind of material.&quot; Mr. Hattan adds that this wouldn't by itself necessarily ban the products, which aren't billing themselves as nutritional foods.    Mr. Hattan suggests that fat-soluble vitamins and minerals may be needed to supplement the fat substitutes. But he suspects at least one other problem. &quot;As these (new fat substitutes) flow through the body, they may have laxative properties,&quot; he says.    FDA researchers say they don't know much yet about the long-term effects of fat substitutes mixing with medication and other substances. Typically, lab tests on food products are for the life cycle of rats or mice -- about four years. Researchers say they aren't sure such tests parallel human consumption of fat over longer periods. &quot;We just don't know,&quot; says the FDA's Mr. Mertz. &quot;With every new development, there are risks.&quot;    The steady increase in the number of food-substitute products also raises philosophical questions about the government's regulatory process. Nutritionists point out that such products have proliferated from margarine and salt to a group that allows people to eat meals that are synthetic from appetizer to dessert. They urge the FDA to look beyond safety to the overall impact on the nation's diet when deciding whether to approve a new product.    &quot;Just because we can imitate fruit, should we?&quot; says the Center for Science's Mr. Jacobson.    Some nutritionists even recommend establishing a national advisory panel on food that would also educate consumers about the new products and how they fit into a nutritional diet.    &quot;Maybe a form of nutritional impact statement about each product is needed to assess whether it's a good thing,&quot; says Mr. Jacobson.    In the end, though, the nutritionists may be asking the impossible. They not only want people to stop eating bad foods; they actually want people to stop craving bad food. As Teachers College's Ms. Gussow says: &quot;The thing to do about sweetness isn't find new forms of it; we need to decide that sweetness isn't the best taste in the world.&quot;    ---                    America's Sweet Tooth   U.S. per-capita consumption of sugar, in pounds*                                             Artificial                              Sugar          Sweeteners                              Per Capita     Per Capita    1965                        113.9            5.7    1975                        118.0            6.2    1985                        130.0           17.0   *Equivalent weight, based on estimate that saccharin is 300 times sweeter than sugar; aspartame is 200 times sweeter.
