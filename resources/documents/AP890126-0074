Patrick McCabe, Ireland's ambassador to Lebanon, said he alsowould head for Beirut from his office in Iraq to investigate thereports.   One of the British hostages is Brian Keenan, a Belfast teacherwith dual British and Irish nationality whose release is also soughtby the Ireland.   A British Embassy spokesman confirmed Ramsay was in west Beirutand indicated he was trying to check reports that Keenan andpossibly British journalist John McCarthy would be released.   The other Briton missing in Lebanon is Anglican Church envoyTerry Waite.   Ramsay denied his visit had a special significance.   ``I often come to west Beirut, and there's nothing significant inmy current visit,'' he told The Associated Press by telephone whenasked if it was in connection with the reports.   He said none of the reports ``can be verified ... I'm anxious toavoid speculation on that subject.''   The envoy spoke from the British consular section in west Beirut.   No faction has claimed to hold Waite, Keenan or McCarthy.   They are among the 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, heldhostage in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   There was no immediate word on where Ramsay went in west Beirutor whom he planned to meet. ``We have heard a report and we'remaking inquiries,'' said the embassy spokesman, on condition ofanonymity.   Earlier, Christian-run Voice of Lebanon radio said prospects thatBritish hostages would soon be freed were growing.   Most hostage releases in the past have been preceded bystatements from the kidnappers. No such statements about Keenan orMcCarthy have been reported.   McCarthy, 31, a producer for the London-based WorldwideTelevision News agency, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, as he drove toBeirut airport to fly to London. Keenan, 38, an English teacher atthe American University of Beirut, was kidnapped in west Beirut sixdays earlier.   Waite was kidnapped Jan. 20, 1987 while on a mission to negotiatethe release of hostages.   McCabe told The Associated Press in the Iraqi capital: ``I'll goto Beirut on the first available flight to investigate rumors thereabout the Irish hostage. But as you know there are many rumors inBeirut.''   He said he had not received any specific information regardingany other hostage and noted he was not in a position to say whetherhe would negotiate with anyone about the hostages.   Sources in Belfast said the Foreign Ministry told Keenan's familyit hoped to have ``good news'' on the hostage soon. Keenan's twosisters were reported to be planning to fly to Beirut.   In Dublin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said: ``At the moment,all we have are rumors from Beirut, but obviously we hope somethingwill come from these rumors.''   Hana Naja, a Lebanese assistant at the Irish consular section inwest Beirut, told The AP: ``We have no solid information yet'' aboutKeenan being released.   There has been a flurry of activity by Irish officials overMiddle East issues in recent days.   Irish Foreign Minister Brian Lenihan met Foreign Minister AliAkbar Velayati of Iran in Paris two weeks ago during aninternational conference on chemical weapons.   Ireland's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Declan Connolly, flew toDamascus, the Syrian capital, after the Paris meeting and held talkswith Syrian government officials on undisclosed topics.   Officials in Damascus said Connolly also met Foreign MinisterFarouk al-Sharaa of Syria on Wednesday night in Damascus.   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troopsin eastern and northern provinces as well as Beirut's Moslem sectors.   The Syrians, Iran's main Arab allies, have been instrumental innegotiating the release of several foreign hostages in recent years.   The reports of a possible release came amid a thaw in relationsbetween Britain and Tehran. They reestablished full diplomaticrelations in November after a 17-month rift.   A 23-year-old Briton, Nicholas Nicola, who had been held in Iranfor two years after a shooting incident, was freed earlier thismonth, raising hopes Britons held in Lebanon might also be freed.</TEXT></DOC>
