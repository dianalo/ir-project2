The unprecedented event occurred Wednesday in a hall of the KarlMarx University of Economics, which proved too small to accommodateall who wanted to hear Otto von Habsburg, the former Hungarian crownprince.   Von Habsburg, a 76-year-old West German citizen, arrived Tuesdayto join a visiting delegation of the European parliament.   The multilingual intellectual, who is still addressed ``YourMajesty'' by some of his friends in Austria and Germany, is a deputyto the Strasbourg parliament from the Bavarian Christian SocialUnion.   His father, emperor Charles I of Austria, was crowned KingCharles IV in Budapest Dec. 30, 1916, two years before theAustro-Hungarian monarchy collapsed.   The visit, unthinkable only a few years ago, comes as Hungary'sCommunist leaders are cautiously enacting a series of reforms underpressure from independent political groups which are demandingmultiparty democracy.   Von Habsburg, a symbol of nationalism for many Hungarians, wasfully aware of the uniqueness of the occasion.   ``It marks a progress in the sense of a freer democracy that theoldest son of the last crowned King of Hungary can deliver a lectureas representative of Germany in the European parliament,'' he said.   His lecture on ``Hungary's Place in Contemporary Europe,''delivered in faultless Hungarian, was the highpoint of his four-dayvisit and also a personal triumph.   The one-time pretender to the Austrian and Hungarian thrones wasoriginally slated to speak to 50 or so members of a specialuniversity college at Karl Marx in a hall with a capacity for about250.   Reporters covering the event estimated the crowd at about 700.   After his lecture, von Habsburg, answered questions for at least45 minutes. His busy schedule during his first official stay inHungary called for 20 different interviews, speeches and meetings.   On Wednesday, he met with senior Communist Party and governmentofficials including Rezsoe Nyers, a leading economist and Politburomember who is also a state minister in the government; IstvanHuszar, the general secretary of the Hungarian People's Front, amass organization; and Laszlo Kovacs, a deputy foreign minister.   In his lecture, von Habsburg said he felt that ``rapprochementbetween the European Community and Hungary will become everstronger.''   ``One thing I want to assure my Hungarian friends of: we hold thedoor wide open for Hungary in the European Community,'' he declaredto applause.   Von Habsburg also pleased the audience by noting that on severaloccasions he had used Hungarian in the European Parliament tounderscore that the the Soviet bloc country ``has the right to bepresent in Europe.''   Earlier in the day, he attended part of a screening of aHungarian film that traces his life from his birth in 1912 toStrasbourg and has been a box-office hit in Budapest theaters forweeks.</TEXT></DOC>
