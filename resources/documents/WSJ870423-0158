Some 200,000 Argentines in the Plaza de Mayo cheered the news as lustily as the crowds once cheered Peron.    But Mr. Alfonsin took pains to draw a crucial distinction. Peron conducted demonstrations on his own behalf; this one was on behalf of democracy, Mr. Alfonsin asserted. To emphasize the point, he had opposition leader Antonio Cafiero beside him on the balcony.    Mr. Alfonsin's problems with the Argentine military are by no means finished. At issue are the human-rights trials of some 250 officers growing out of the &quot;dirty war&quot; against left-wing guerrillas a decade ago. Reports from Buenos Aires indicate that the president may be trying to put the trials into the hands of the Supreme Court, which is in emergency session and has requested reports from local courts on the evidence against the officers. An AP dispatch yesterday said the court is considering reinterpreting laws so as to free from prosecution some officers who have pleaded that they were merely obeying orders.    If the president can achieve this without producing a major counterprotest from the Argentine left, he may succeed in quieting unrest. If he achieves that, the paramountcy of elected, civilian government over the military might finally have a solid foothold in Argentine political thought. One benefit of the uprising of younger officers has been the opportunity for Mr. Alfonsin to replace senior officers. Nineteen have resigned or been fired since the trouble began. No one can say the president has been timid in asserting his mandate from Argentina's voters.    Success in curbing the military's power could aid Mr. Alfonsin's economic reforms. He and his economic-policy ministers have been trying, with some success, to break up strongly entrenched industrial monopolies, which have for years thwarted competition and hence, economic modernization. One of the obstacles to breaking up and privatizing these state industries has been their tight connections with the military. Unless they can be broken, Argentina may be doomed to continued fiscal and monetary instability as such industries drain away state revenues.    Ironically, Argentina gained its historic opportunity to become a functioning democracy by losing the Malvinas (or Falklands) war to England. The loss badly damaged the military's prestige. The public reaction against the military put in doubt the longstanding assumption among military officers that they were the ultimate guardians of the state and thus entitled to take charge of it whenever there was danger of a breakdown in civilian authority. It is by no means certain that the human-rights charges and the replacement of senior officers have changed the military culture in any dramatic way, but clearly the military is on the defensive.    Mr. Alfonsin, whose Radical Civic Union is essentially a party of the middle class, has kept democracy alive for 40 months. His term still has 32 months to go. By Argentine standards, he hasn't done badly. It may be that the Argentines have begun to learn the power of democracy and hence will make greater efforts than they have in the past to preserve it. If that's what the cheering in the Plaza de Mayo meant, Argentina's future has brightened. </TEXT></DOC>
