In a friend-of-the-court brief filed Tuesday in federalcourt in Wichita, the Justice Department supported a motionby an anti-abortion group, Operation Rescue, which is seekingsuspension of a judge's order restricting protests aimed atclosing abortion clinics in the city.</LP><TEXT>   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said inKennebunkport, Maine, that the administration's action &quot;washandled routinely&quot; by the Justice Department, without thepresident's participation. Mr. Bush is vacationing in Maine.   In Washington, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh appearedto cloud the issue somewhat by insisting that theadministration had taken &quot;no position&quot; on the volatile issue.He said the department had merely restated a position it hastaken in a pending Supreme Court case, that federal judgesshouldn't be involved in the dispute over anti-abortionprotests.   Last week, federal Judge Patrick Kelly ordered that twoWichita abortion clinics be kept open. He also threatened tojail any protesters who violated the order by blockingentrances to the facilities, according the the AssociatedPress. Nearly 2,000 members of Operation Rescue reportedlyhave been arrested since the demonstrations began inmid-July.   Meanwhile, the president seems to have concluded that Mr.Thornburgh will shortly resign to run for the Senate fromPennsylvania. Although the attorney general told reporters hehasn't made up his mind, Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Thornburgh&quot;expects to leave soon,&quot; but has not specified a date.   The presidential spokesman added that there was &quot;noimmediate hurry&quot; to select a replacement as Congress is outof session and a confirmation vote couldn't come untilmid-September at the earliest. Deputy Attorney GeneralWilliam Barr, who is thought to be a candidate to succeed Mr.Thornburgh, will serve as acting attorney general in theinterim, Mr. Fitzwater said.   At the Justice Department, Mr. Thornburgh said he is stillreviewing an appeals court decision that resurrected a Nov. 5special election in Pennsylvania and will announce his plans&quot;in the near future.&quot;   White House officials say Mr. Bush has had a list ofcandidates in mind for weeks, but isn't sharing hispreference with aides. Besides Mr. Barr, possible successorsare Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, U.S. TradeRepresentative Carla Hills, Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft,former California Gov. George Deukmejian, New Hampshire Sen.Warren Rudman, Solicitor General Kenneth Starr and WhiteHouse counsel C. Boyden Gray, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
