Before signing a sweeping accord Friday pledging tonormalize relations between the two countries, North andSouth Korean prime ministers also vowed to meet before theend of December to begin discussing the question ofinspection of North Korea's nuclear energy researchfacilities.</LP><TEXT>   South Korea and its allies allege that North Korea isabout two years away from being able to build a deliverablenuclear explosive. The pact doesn't mention the nuclearquestions.   &quot;We will push ahead with our position&quot; on scrapping NorthKorea's nuclear fuel-reprocessing facilities and allowinginspection, said Deputy Prime Minister and UnificationMinister Choi Ho-Joong. South Korea officials were sayingover the weekend that the agreement wouldn't be ratifieduntil North Korea agreed to inspection.   That's important, diplomats and defense analysts say,because North Korea may have intended to have theconciliatory nonaggression agreement serve as a distractionfrom the more pressing nuclear question and delay settlementof it. &quot;We want to keep North Korea's feet to the fire on thenuke question,&quot; said a Western diplomat.   South Korea already has pledged that it is a nuclearfree-zone and has offered to let North Korea inspect allfacilities in South Korea for compliance if North Korea willdo the same. So far, North Korea has refused to allowinternational inspection of its facilities. South Korea'ssweeping offer suggests that U.S. nuclear weapons aren't inSouth Korea or won't be by the time President Bush arrivesfor a state visit in early January.   The signing of the nonaggression pact may also quellspeculation that the U.S. will make a so-called &quot;surgicalstrike&quot; to blow up North Korean nuclear research facilities.Such an option, while threatened, was never taken seriouslyby military planners here or in Washington who understoodNorth Korea's ability and will to counterattack.   How much progress the two sides will make during thenuclear talks is hard to guess because so little is knownabout North Korean motivations for switching their positionand signing the nonaggression pact. &quot;Our ability to predictNorth Korea is rather limited,&quot; says a top South Koreannational security planner.   Solid progress could be made in the nuclear talks if NorthKorea is motivated by international pressure, as some think.But it is more likely that the hard-line Communist regime ismotivated by a failing economy and will do only the minimumnecessary to stave off collapse.   South Korean security planners said that they are hoping atrip to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang this week byRep. Stephen Solarz, chairman of the U.S. House ofRepresentatives subcommittee on Asia and Pacific Affairs,will shed some more light on North Korean motives. The trip,which has the full support of the South Korean government andthe U.S. State Department, may include a meeting with NorthKorean President Kim Il-Sung.</TEXT></DOC>
