This overviewand other general observations on the microstructural evolution thatprecedes the transition to the amorphous state of irradiated crystallinematerials expose some of the important data that must be accounted forby theory. A perspective of our present understanding of irradiation-inducedamorphization is then presented. As described in previous work, the theoryassumes a localized buildup of complexes (coupled interstitial/vacancypairs) to a critical value as the mechanism of amorphization. The theoryof complex formation implies that the production of a defective statecharacterized by localized anisotropic distortions of the crystallinelattice leads to amorphization. It is proposed that this concept canbe generalized to encompass solid state amorphization transitions otherthan those induced by irradiation. Examples available in the literatureto support this idea are presented. It is therefore suggested that irradiationcan be used as a valuable tool to study other solid state amorphizationtransitions. 47 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
