The temblor, the second to rock the state in two days,registered about 5.7 on the Richter scale, according to Universityof California seismologists.   No injuries or serious damage was reported.   Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Geological Survey inMenlo Park, said the epicenter of the 11:43 a.m. quake was 16 milessouth of San Jose, near Loma Prieta Mountain on the San AndreasFault.   The quake was one of the strongest in the San Francisco Bay areaon the San Andreas Fault since the ``Great Earthquake'' of 1906,said Robert Uhrhammer at the University of California SeismographicStations at Berkeley. That quake, which started fires thatdestroyed much of the city, had an estimated magnitude of 8.3 onthe Richter scale, which had not yet been devised.   The 650-mile-long San Andreas Fault annually produces dozens ofquakes.   A quake measuring 5 can cause considerable damage, while amagnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage.   Most people in quake-prone Northern California took the shakingin stride, but others found it unnerving.   On the 17th floor of the Federal Building, Oakland Hells Angelsmember James ``Fuzzy'' Neal said there was ``a little bit ofpanic'' in a courtroom where a drug trial was under way.   ``It's bad enough being in a two-story house when one goes off.I knew I couldn't run down the steps and get out,'' Neal said.   But Ginger Johnson, a receptionist for Montgomery Securities onthe 21st floor of the landmark Transamerica building, said workerswere so unconcerned that ``our traders immediately started bettingon how big it was.'' The 48-floor pyramid-shaped tower was built towithstand far more powerful temblors.   In Sunnyvale, 40 miles to the south, chunks of cement fell fromthe ceiling of a parking garage.   At the Holy City Art Glass shop near the epicenter and just 100yards from the San Andreas Fault, sheets of glass flew off racksand stained glass windows leaning against a wall toppled and broke,causing about $400 in damage, said artist Tom Stanton.   Groceries at a 7-Eleven at Scotts Valley fell off shelves andcustomers ``were thrown up against the outside wall,'' said clerkJudy Young. Damage also was reported at a nearby supermarket.   On Sunday, an earthquake measuring 4.5 to 4.7 on the Richterscale shook a wide area of Southern California, including downtownLos Angeles, but no serious damage was reported. At least fourpeople were treated for minor injuries.   Monday's quake was felt as far north as Santa Rosa, about 60miles north of San Francisco, and to the south about 100 miles awayon the Monterey Peninsula. Although Berkeley scientists upgradedtheir magnitude from an earlier reading of about 5.0, otheragencies stuck to a lower estimate.   The U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake InformationCenter in Golden, Colo., estimated the magnitude at 5.0, as did thesurvey's Menlo Park office.   Estimates differ because the earthquake information center basedits estimate on body waves generated by the quake, while theSeismographic Stations' figure is based on measurement of surfacewaves, Jacobs said.   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake,as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Eachincrease of one number means the ground motion was 10 times greater.</TEXT></DOC>
