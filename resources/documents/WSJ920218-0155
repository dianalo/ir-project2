By postponing the deliveries, the government hopes toshrink Korea's current-account deficit, which expanded to$7.3 billion last year from $2 billion in 1990. The deficithas become a hot political issue in this election year, andthe government has decided that it needs to reduce thecountry's imports. (The current account comprises trade ingoods and services, plus certain fund transfers.)</LP><TEXT>   Airplanes aren't the only target. The government recentlyopened an inquiry into toothpick imports from China. Andaccording to local press reports over the weekend, Seoul mayalso delay the creation of a second mobile-telecommunicationsnetwork because the project would require heavy imports ofequipment. Several U.S. phone companies are bidding for thatproject.   According to airline officials, the government has askedAsiana Airlines, a relatively new carrier that is seeking toexpand, to postpone deliveries scheduled for this year of twopassenger jets on order, while Korean Air, a unit of HanjinGroup which is facing capacity loads on many of its majorroutes, has been asked to delay deliveries of four jets.Altogether, the delays could shift about $310 million inimports to next year's trade accounts, covering orders fromBoeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. of the U.S. andEurope's Airbus Industrie consortium.   However, airline officials and others say the plan isill-conceived. These critics say that in the fast-growingAsian-Pacific market, the delays will place the Koreancarriers at a disadvantage against rivals from the U.S.,Japan and Hong Kong. &quot;We need them,&quot; said a Korean Airspokesman. &quot;This doesn't help at all. We will have to delaythis year our plans to expand our routes.&quot;   Economists agree, and add that delaying aircraftdeliveries won't relieve pressure on Korea's externalaccounts. &quot;This would not in any way address the root cause{of the current-account deficit}. In fact, it may interferewith efforts to improve the international competitiveness ofthe domestic airline industry,&quot; said Young Soo-Gil, aneconomist with the Korea Development Institute, agovernment-sponsored think tank. &quot;I don't think it makessense.&quot;   In addition, Korean airline executives have told U.S.makers that one large passenger jet can generate about $50million in foreign-exchange revenue a year. Said a Westerndiplomat in Seoul: &quot;The American carriers will be laughingall the way to the ticket counter.&quot;   For Korea, the problem is that more than 90% of Korea'stotal trade deficit, which last year totaled $9.6 billion, isdue to a large shortfall with Japan, which doesn't supplycommercial aircraft. Korea has found it difficult to reducethe deficit with Japan because its industries are heavilydependent on Japanese suppliers of machinery and parts.   Some find it troubling that Korea's solution to itsdeficit with Japan is to target U.S. and European imports.The U.S. ambassador to Korea, Donald P. Gregg, said: &quot;I havemade the strongest possible statement that this isshortsighted. There is a tendency here to move to a quick fixthat doesn't make any sense in the long run.&quot;   Officials at Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus saidthey haven't been told whether there will be changes in theirdelivery schedules to Korean carriers. &quot;Everyone who is doingbusiness in Korea is concerned,&quot; said an official with Airbusin Toulouse, France. The U.S. planes were ordered with muchhoopla during trade missions to the U.S. led by Koreangovernment officials in recent years.   Airline officials said the Korean carriers already haveheld meetings with government officials to negotiate newdelivery schedules. Asiana said it agreed with government&quot;suggestions&quot; to lease, rather than buy, one of six Boeingjets scheduled for delivery this year, and to delay untilearly 1993 the delivery of a $130 million Boeing 747-400scheduled for late 1992.   Korean Air said it is still negotiating with thegovernment. It had planned to take delivery of 11 planes thisyear. One, a Boeing 747-400, has already been delivered. Italso is scheduled to take delivery of another 747-400, threeMcDonnell Douglas MD-11's, three Airbus A-300's, and threeF-100 passenger jets from NV Fokker of the Netherlands.   Ironically, many economists have already predicted thatgrowth in Korea's current-account deficit will slow thisyear. And they note that the deficit has ballooned mostlybecause of heavy imports of machinery, which eventually willboost the country's export capacity. Exports are expected togrow about 12% this year from 1991 levels. Overall economicgrowth this year is forecast at about 7%, compared to 8.6% in1991 -- a slowdown that government economic planners say isneeded.</TEXT></DOC>
