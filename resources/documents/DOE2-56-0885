This design produces negligible noise growth for spontaneousnoise sources as large as 20 dB above shot noise, and thus corrects thedefects present in earlier iterations of the design, which resulted indiminished gain at the signal frequency because of space-charge effectsas well as enhanced spontaneous noise growth at frequencies lower thanthe signal frequency. In addition, more realistic engineering designconstraints on the waveguide size and the wiggler gap spacing have beenset by the waveguide wall loading and the electron beam fill factor andhave been incorporated in the final base line design. The design assumesthat the ETA-II accelerator will supply an electron beam with an energyof 10 MeV, a current of 3 kA, and a brightness of 1.0 x 10{sup 8} A/(mrad){sup 2}. With this beam and 500 W of input power at a frequency of250 GHz, the peak output TE{sub 01} power predicted by the simulationcodes, for a rectangular waveguide of dimensions 3.5 x 3.0 cm{sup 2},is in excess of 12 GW, corresponding to an extraction efficiency of 44%.The wiggler has an overall length of 5.5 m and a period of 10 cm. Itconsists of a 2-m untapered section at a magnetic field of about 4.3kG followed by a 3.5-m tapered section with magnetic field ranging froma peak value of 4.5 kG to a minimum of 390 G. The growth of the beamlinear fill factor to about 50% sets the lower limit of the magneticfield strength in the tapered wiggler region. A nonsteering, nondisplacingbinomial winding pattern has been incorporated into the wiggler profile.</TEXT></DOC>
