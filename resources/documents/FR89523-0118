NPF-1 issuedto Portland General Electric Company, et al., (the licensee), for operationof Trojan Nuclear Plant, located in Columbia County, Oregon. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment </ITAG>Identification of Proposed Action The proposed amendment is a request to condition the Trojan Technical Specificationfor use of a new fuel design not previously used in the Trojan reactor.The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated November 20, 1987, supplemented by letters dated May 27,1988 and August 12, 1988. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed Amendment is needed to allow the use of a new upgraded fueldesign not previously used in the Trojan reactor. The fuel design, WestinghouseVantage 5, has reconstitutable assembly top nozzles and axial fuel blankets,features designed to improve fuel operating economy. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action Operation with the new fuel design is within the range of impacts evaluatedin the Final Environmental Statement related to operation of Trojan datedAugust 1973. The proposed action would not involve a significant changein the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated,nor does it involve a new or different kind of accident. Consequently,any radiological releases resulting from an accident would not be significantlygreater than previously determined. The proposed amendment does not otherwiseaffect routine radiological plant effluents. Therefore, the Commissionconcludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impactsassociated with the proposed amendment. The Commission also concludes thatthe proposed action will not result in a significant increase in individualor cumulative occupational radiation exposure. With regard to nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendment does notaffect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact.Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiologicalenvironmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 24, 1989 (53 FR 5495). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice. Alternatives to the Proposed Action Because the Commission has concluded that there are no significant environmentalimpacts associated with the proposed action, there is no need to examinealternatives to the proposed action. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin connection with the Final Environmental Statement related to the operationof Trojan Nuclear Plant, dated August 1973. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request that supports the proposedamendment. The NRC staff did not consult other agencies or persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendment. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludesthe proposed action will have no significant adverse effect on the qualityof the human environment.
