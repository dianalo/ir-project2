<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-1239 </DOCNO><TEXT>A stationary collisional-radiative model including both inelastic electron--atomand atom--atom collisions is used to examine nonequilibrium weakly ionizedargon plasmas with atomic densities 10{sup 16}--10{sup 20} cm{sup -3},temperatures below 6000 K, and with different degrees of radiation trapping.It is shown that three-body atomic recombination (e+A{sup +}+A{yields}A+A)becomes important at high particle densities. Comparison is made betweenthe present approach and Thomson's theory for atomic recombination.</TEXT></DOC>
