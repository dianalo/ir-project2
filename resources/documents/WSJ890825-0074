After the meeting, Prime said the board elected the nominees of J.H. Whitney andamp; Co. as directors and then resigned, with the exception of John S. Dulaney.    Prime said Mr. Dulaney, a director for 16 years, will remain on the board until Whitney's acquisition of Prime is completed. About 91% of Prime's fully diluted shares have been tendered to Whitney under its $20-a-share tender offer.    The incumbent slate apparently defeated a dissident slate proposed by Bennett S. Lebow, chairman of MAI Basic Four Inc., which last month dropped its hostile tender offer for Prime in the wake of Whitney's higher friendly offer.    The new board, as planned, named as president and chief executive officer James F. McDonald, formerly chairman of Gould Inc., who also will join the board.    The vote remains to be officially tabulated and verified. </TEXT></DOC>
