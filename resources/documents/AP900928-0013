The unit is supposed to be used to wash troops free of chemicalweapons or any other dangerous substances they come in contact within the field.   But for now, it's also doubling as the shower.   Everyone follows the same routine: two minutes of water followedby one minute to lather up followed by two minutes of water torinse.   Or, as Capt. Adrian Burke of Deer Park, Texas, puts it:   ``You wet down, wash up, rinse off and dry up and you're good togo for another day.''   You have to spend some time in the Saudi desert, where thepowdery sand clings to everything and everyone, to appreciate suchniceties.   ``A four-minute shower might not seem like much, but out hereit's the highlight of the day,'' Burke said during a recent visitto the camp, named after World War II Marine Ace Joe Foss.</TEXT><HEAD>---</HEAD><TEXT>   No matter where a soldier goes, there are constants - such asmilitary food.   When there are no other meals available the troops getmodern-day C-rations, known today as Meals Ready to Eat. They're3,000 calories, with the choice ranging from chicken a la king tobeef stew. uffice it to say they're not too tasty.   ``Anyone who can eat an MRE ought to be able to take a hill,''Marine Commandant Gen. Alfred Gray told a group of Marines during avisit to their camp Wednesday.   These men had just had a treat - a hot breakfast in the desert,including what several men said was their first cup of hot coffeesince they arrived in Saudi Arabia five weeks ago.   But the breakfast menu had a familiar, chow-hall ring: creamedbeef, ham and eggs, potatoes and pound cake.</TEXT><HEAD>---</HEAD><TEXT>   The Air Force is keeping its F-117 Stealth fighter-bomber awayfrom reporters, but not because they don't want to show it off.   The Stealth was deployed to the region more than a month ago andAir Force spokesmen soon after began taking names of reporters andphotographers who wanted to see the radar-eluding aircraft andinterview its pilots.   But those plans are now on hold because of objections raised bythe Saudi government, according to miliary sources.   The Stealth is considered an offensive weapon, and the Americandeployment in Saudi Arabia is described as a defensive mission.   ``The Saudis are worried it would send the wrong signals,'' oneof the military sources said.</TEXT></DOC>
