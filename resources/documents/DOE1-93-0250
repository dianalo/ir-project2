Fumes generated during the meat-wrappingprocess were causing concern among the workers as they experienced respiratoryirritation and distress. It appeared that only some of the meat wrappersexperienced difficulty, only some of the rolls of film-produced irritationsin the affected workers, and affected workers had prior histories ofrespiratory difficulties. Fumes were generated during hot-wire film cutting.The amount of fume generated depended significantly on the care takenduring the operation. If the dispensing machines were improperly adjusted,large amounts of fumes could be obtained during the cutting process.The author concludes that the amounts of these chemicals released duringthis operation does not constitute a health hazard to the employees.It may be necessary, however, to remove persons with prior respiratoryirritation from this particular job location.</TEXT></DOC>
