In the mercurial bond market, euphoria has seized a growing number of investment managers. Recent fears of a weakening dollar, a sudden surge in inflation and a possible disappearance of foreign investors from the U.S. markets have all but evaporated.    The dollar's relative stability over the past month has played a big role in rebuilding optimism. So have declines in various inflation indicators, especially a severe drop in the price of gold, which hit a four-month low Friday. Growing signs of slower economic growth also have bolstered hopes for lower interest rates over the next few months.    Edward Labenski, senior portfolio manager at IDS Financial Corp. in Minneapolis, which manages about $20 billion of fixed-income securities, contends &quot;1988 is a great year to buy bonds.&quot; He adds: &quot;We're going to look back on October 1987 and say why didn't we buy long-term (Treasury) bonds?&quot; which then offered yields of nearly 10 1/2%. As of late last week, 30-year Treasury bonds yielded about 8.4%, the lowest in more than six months. Mr. Labenski said &quot;I wouldn't be surprised&quot; if the yield on these issues drops to 7.6% this year.    Only a handful of analysts contend the bond rally is a bubble that will burst later this year. Many, though, say interest rates may rise temporarily this week, mainly because a large wave of Treasury borrowing will hit the credit markets. The Treasury will sell $27 billion of notes and bonds in a three-part auction scheduled to begin tomorrow. Also, some economists predict a Labor Department report to be released Friday will show strong gains in employment during January.    Even if rates do rise this week, many analysts expect lower borrowing costs over the long term. &quot;We'll see 7 1/2% on the government long bond by the end of May and possibly even 6 3/4% by year end,&quot; says Michael Davis, a vice president and market technician who manages $100 million at Swink andamp; Co. in Little Rock, Ark. &quot;We're in a bull market now.&quot;    Some interest rates have tumbled about two percentage points since the stock market crashed last October. Bond yields fell again Friday amid speculation the Federal Reserve will ease credit to shore up a slumping economy. The rally accelerated later in the day as commodity prices, including gold, tumbled and as the Veterans Administration cut its rate on long-term, fixed-rate mortgages to 9.5% from 10.5%.    The Fed's policy committee meets Feb. 9 and 10 to review strategy and its money-supply targets for this year. A report in this newspaper Friday said signals from the Fed suggest the central bank may soon ease.    Some private economists think the Fed committee this week will leave policy unchanged. But they predict the committee also will authorize a credit-easing move to be implemented if the economy weakens, the dollar holds steady, and inflation remains subdued.    &quot;We can sustain this buoyant bond market even without the Fed's help,&quot; said William Wallace, a managing director and head of government securities sales at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;I don't see the Fed easing, but I don't think it's that important at the moment.&quot;    &quot;I'm still bullish&quot; on bonds, says George J. Collins, president of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. in Baltimore. &quot;Some of the numbers on the economy initially look good, but when you examine them closer, they look weaker.&quot; Also, he says, bonds &quot;still look good when you compare yields on stocks to yields on long-term bonds.&quot;    The dollar &quot;isn't a concern right now,&quot; Mr. Collins said. &quot;So I think they (Fed officials) have got a little leeway&quot; to ease. Also, &quot;we keep forgetting the fact that this is an election year,&quot; he added, referring to political pressure on the Fed to keep the economy from sliding into a recession.    &quot;We're seeing the investor put money back into long-term bonds and intermediate bonds,&quot; Mr. Collins said. &quot;It's pretty clear that the investor out there has gotten confidence in bonds and is coming back into the market again.&quot; T. Rowe Price manages about $22 billion of debt and equity securities.    Marshall B. Front, executive vice president at Stein Roe andamp; Farnham Inc., a Chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $14 billion of stocks and bonds, also expects lower interest rates. He said banks soon may lower their prime, or base, lending rates, now 8 3/4%. Also, he said long-term Treasury bond yields appear likely to drop below 8% over the next few months.    &quot;With the slowdown in business in the first half, I wouldn't be surprised to see the Federal Reserve begin to loosen credit slightly,&quot; Mr. Front said. &quot;Sometime in this quarter, the Fed could look at the economy and say we see some soft spots. The inflation we were concerned about last year has not materialized. Gold prices and other commodity prices are receding.&quot; Thus, he concluded, &quot;for a while the Fed may err on the side of being a bit more generous.&quot;    Much of the optimism in the bond market last week was fueled by a government report showing a huge increase in inventories during last year's fourth quarter. Many analysts said that suggested the economy finally is running out of steam, and a few even warned that a recession is at hand.    Some economists, though, argue that the worry about the economy is exaggerated. &quot;There's too much hysteria about the buildup in inventories,&quot; said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc., Chicago. He said Commerce Department figures indicate the increase in inventories is largely among autos and imported goods, citing the latest inventories-to-sales ratios for November.    For instance, the latest figures show that the manufacturing and wholesale sectors at 1.61 and 1.29, respectively, are &quot;comfortably below the 20-year averages of 1.77 and 1.32,&quot; Mr. Hale said. &quot;I think this suggests that the fear that huge (domestic) inventories are signaling recession is misplaced. We're not going to get a recession in 1988,&quot; he predicted.    Mr. Hale said the bond market likely will remain highly volatile, &quot;reflecting violent changes in expectations&quot; on the economy's health and the inflation outlook. Yields on long-term government bonds likely will gyrate between 8 1/4% and 9 1/2% during the first half before rising to 10% by the end of the year, he said.    Mr. Collins of T. Rowe Price also expects higher interest rates later this year. &quot;Eventually inflation will come back to the 5% to 5 1/2% level toward year end, and then you'll have somewhat higher interest rates,&quot; he says. &quot;But right now, I think you're OK&quot; buying bonds.    A report issued today by the National Association of Purchasing Management indicates the industrial economy grew at a slower pace during January than in December. But the report also says new orders were &quot;particularly strong.&quot;    The economy &quot;entered 1988 with a healthy, although slower rate of growth than it ended 1987,&quot; said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc. &quot;The growth in new orders was the largest in three months and suggests a respectable if not vigorous economy in the first quarter.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Bond prices surged again Friday. Actively traded long-term Treasury bonds rose about three-quarters of a point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount.    The latest 30-year Treasury bonds were quoted late Friday at 104 29/32, up from 104 4/32 Thursday. The yield dropped to 8.42% from 8.49%. The latest 10-year Treasury notes were quoted late Friday at 104 3/32, up from 103 22/32, while the yield declined to 8.25% from 8.31%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 7.77 points to 1316.84. It ranged between 1309.14 and 1318.22.    Rates declined on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the latest three-month bills fell to 5.63% bid from 5.69%, while the rate on the latest six-month bills declined to 6.02% bid from 6.05%.    The Treasury tomorrow is scheduled to sell $9.25 billion of three-year notes, followed by $9 billion of 10-year notes Wednesday and $8.75 billion of 29 1/4-year bonds Thursday.    The federal funds rate, which is the rate on reserves banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.79% Friday, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was up from 6.73% Thursday. </TEXT></DOC>
