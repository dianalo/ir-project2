Martin, Director, StateRelations and Assistance Division, Office of Juvenile Justice and DelinquencyPrevention (OJJDP), 633 Indiana Avenue, NW., Room 768, Washington, DC 20531;telephone (202) 724-5921.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Introduction and Background</ITAG>In an effort to comply with the jail lockup removal mandate, section 223(a)(14)(42 U.S.C. 5633(a)(14)) of the JJDP Act, staff of state administering agenciesand facility administrators are often called upon to identify alternativesto holding juveniles in jail cells or lockups while law enforcement officerscarry out their responsibilities of identification, investigation, processing,release to parent(s) or guardian, hold for transfer to an appropriate juveniledetention or shelter facility, or transfer to court. the OJJDP recognizesthat during this interim period, a balance must be struck between the statutoryobjective of not holding juveniles in jail cells or lockup areas beyondthe six hour temporary holding period permitted for accused criminal-typeoffenders (a juvenile alleged to have committed, or charged with an offensethat would be a crime if committed by an adult); and, not allowing juvenilesin temporary law enforcement custody to disrupt police operations or toleave a police, sheriff or municipal facility without authorization.Section 31.304(m) of the OJJDP Formula Grants Regulation published in theJune 20, 1985, <T4>Federal Register </T4>on pages 25550-25561 (28 CFR Part 312, definesan <T3>adult jail</T3> as:<ITAG tagnum="21">A locked facility, administered by state, county, or local law enforcementand correctional agencies, the purpose of which is to detain adults chargedwith violating criminal law, pending trial. Also considered as adult jailsare those facilities used to hold convicted adult criminal offenders sentencedfor less than one year.</ITAG>Section 31.304(n) of the Formula Grants Regulation defines an <T3>adult lockup </T3>as:<ITAG tagnum="21">Similar to an adult jail except that an adult lockup is generallya municipal or police facility of a temporary nature which does not holdpersons after they have been formally charged.</ITAG>While these definitions provide general parameters, the efforts of stateagency staff to monitor compliance with the JJDP Act jail and lockup removalrequirement and to identify alternatives indicate a need for specific guidelinesto identify when a juvenile is being securely detained or confined in anadult jail or lockup area. In making this determination, it is criticalto distinguish between nonsecure custody and secure detention or confinement(for purposes of this policy, the terms secure detention or confinement,secure cutsody, and secure holding are synonymous). A juvenile may be inlaw enforcement custody and, therefore, not free to leave or depart fromthe presence of a law enforcement officer or at liberty to leave the premisesof a law enforcement facility, but not be in a secure detention or confinementstatus. A secure detention or confinement status has occurred within a jail orlockup facility when a juvenile is physically detained or confined in alocked room, set of rooms, or a cell that is designated, set aside or usedfor the specific purpose of securely detaining persons who are in law enforcementcustody. Secure detention or confinement may result either from being placedin such a room or enclosure and/or from being physically secured to a cuffingrail or other stationary object. This policy is designed to assist state agency staff and facility administratorsin identifying non-secure alternatives for custody of juveniles withinlaw enforcement facilities. The policy assumes that immediate access ortransfer of a juvenile to a juvenile detention center or appropriate nonsecurefacility is not possible, and that no area is available within the buildingor on the grounds that qualifies as a separate juvenile detention facilityunder the requirements set forth in the Formula Grants Regulation at 28CFR 31.303(e)(3)(i). This policy provides guidance in identifying practicesthat do not constitute violations of the statutory jail removal requirement.As such, it reflects the effective strategies many law enforcement jurisdictionsare using to achieve jail removal. The policy is not offered as standardsfor practice, nor does it surpersede any state laws, policies or guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Comments </ITAG>A proposed policy was published was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 28, 1988, for public comment. Commentswere received from 12 national, state, and local organizations. All commentshave been considered by the OJJDP in the issuance of a final policy. The following is a summary of the comments and the response by OJJDP: 1. <T3>Comment: </T3>Booking areas used to process juveniles and adults aredifferent to classify because there are wide variations in their configurationsand levels of security. Respondents indicated that it is unclear whetherOJJDP considers booking areas to be secure or nonsecure. <T3>Response: </T3>While a booking area may be secure, a juvenile beingprocessed ``through'' this area is not considered to be in a secure detentionstatus. Where a secure booking area is all that is available, and continuous visualsupervision is provided throughout the booking process, and the juvenileonly remains in the booking area long enough to be photographed and fingerprinted(consistent with state law and/or judicial rules), the juvenile will notbe considered in a secure detention status. Continued nonsecure custodyfor the purposes of interrogation, contacting parents, or arranging analternative placement must occur outside the booking area. 2. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two respondents indicated that a prohibition on handcuffingjuveniles to a cuffing rail or other stationary objects is not a viablerestriction given safety and cost considerations. <T3>Response: </T3>OJJDP understands that many juveniles taken into custodypose a potential risk to self and/or law enforcement officers. Clearly,the officer taking a juvenile into custody must rely on his or her judgementof the level of risk posed by the juvenile. It is, however, OJJDP's responsibility to clearly define when a juveniletaken into custody enters a secure detention status. Where an officer determinesthat a juvenile taken into custody as an <T3>accused </T3>criminal-type offender must be handcuffed to a cuffingrail or other stationary object, or placed in a cell or lockup area, thisis permissible under andSection; 31.303(f)(5)(iv)(H) of the OJJDP FormulaGrants Regulation (28 CFR 31), for up to six hours. It should be noted,however, that for monitoring purposes, the six hour, ``grace period'' beginsto run when the juvenile enters a secure detention status and ends sixhours later.It is also important to point out that handcuffing techniques that do notinvolve cuffing rails or other stationary objects will be considered nonsecurecustody where the additional criteria for nonsecure custody set forth inthis policy are adhered to. Thus, juvenile offenders can be consideredin nonsecure custody, even though handuffed, where necessary, so long asa stationary object is not in use. 3. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two respondents expressed concern that without a timelimit on nonsecure custody, juveniles could end up spending more time inlaw enforcement facilities than at present. It was recommended that nonsecurecustody be limited to six hours. <T3>Response: </T3>One criterion in the policy for determining that custodyis nonsecure is that the area where the juvenile remains not be designedor intended for use as a residential area. This reflects OJJDP's policythat if a juvenile is to remain in custody long enough to require residentialservices, the juvenile should be moved to an apppropriate juvenile residentialfacility as soon as this need is identified. Once an area of a jail orlockup facility begins to be used for residential purposes, the juvenilewill be considered to be in a secure detention status. Beyond this ``nonresidential'' requirement, and the other limiting criteriain this policy, the JJDP Act does not confer upon the OJJDP the authorityto limit the length of nonsecure custody. 4. <T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent stated that recordkeeping deficienciesat the facility level often make it difficult to determine when juvenilesare placed in cells or other secure holding areas, and that this problemwill also exist in attempting to monitor the handcuffing of juveniles tocuffing rails or other stationary objects. <T3>Response: </T3>Each participating state is required, pursuant to section223(a)(15) of the JJDP Act, to have an adequate monitoring system. It isexpected that states will work with local facilities to develop adequaterecordkeeping procedures. As for recording juveniles placed in a holding cell or other secure area,many police departments handle this by adding the designation ``cell''or ``secure'' to their juvenile admission/booking log. Departments shouldbe particularly willing to do this when liability factors are taken intoconsideration, i.e., in the event of litigation, departments need to knowif a juvenile was or was not placed in a secure area or in a secure detentionstatus, and if so, for how long. 5. <T3>Comment: </T3>Three respondents suggested that the policy does notaddress the separation provision, section 223(a)(13) of the JJDP Act. <T3>Response: </T3>The policy is designed to identify nonsecure alternativesfor the custody and handling of juveniles within law enforcement facilities.The section 223(a)(13) separation requirement of the JJDP Act does notapply to juveniles in a nonsecure custody status. 6. <T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent indicated that court holding facilitiesshould be subject to the Deinstitutionalization of Status Offenders provision,section 223(a)(12)(A) of the JJDP Act. Another suggested adding requirementsfor staff supervision and time limits for court holding facilities. <T3>Response: </T3>Section 223(a)(12)(A) of the JJDP Act requires the removalof status and nonoffenders from secure detention and correctional facilities.Section 103 of the Act defines both facility categories to mean ``residential''facilities. This policy clearly states that in order for a court holding facility tobe exempt from the adult jail and lockup removal provision of the JJDPAct, it must be nonresidential. The policy also states that the court holdingfacility cannot be used for punitive purposes or other purposes unrelatedto a court appearance, and it confirms that the section 223(a)(13) separationrequirement applies to court holding facilities. These requirements pertainto status and nonoffenders, as well as to criminal-type offenders. As for time limitations, the nonresidential requirement does impose aninherent or practical time limitation. That is, the juvenile must be broughtto and removed from the facility during the same judicial day. The final policy does not address the level of supervision necessary incourt holding facilities. However, it is clearly essential that sufficientlevels of supervision be provided to ensure the safety of those juvenilesbefore the court, and the integrity of the court process itself. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>This notice does not constitute a ``major'' rule as defined by ExecutiveOrder 12291 because it does not result in: (a) An effect on the economyof $100 million or more, (b) a major increase in any costs or prices, or(c) adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity,or innovation among American enterprises.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>This policy does not have a ``significant'' economic impact on a substantialnumber of small ``entities'', as defined by the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (Pub.

Policy: Criteria for Law Enforcement Facilities</ITAG>The following policy criteria, if satisfied, will constitute nonsecurecustody of a juvenile in a building that houses an adult jail or lockupfacility:(1) The area(s) where the juvenile is held is an unlocked multi-purposearea, such as a lobby, office, or interrogation room which is not designated,set aside or used as a secure detention area or is not a part of such anarea, or, if a secure area, is used only for processing purposes; (2) Thejuvenile is not physically secured to a cuffing rail or other stationaryobject during the period of custody in the facility; (3) the use of thearea(s) is limited to providing nonsecure custody only long enough andfor the purposes of identification, investigation, processing, releaseto parents, or arranging transfer to an appropriate juvenile facility orto court; (4) in no event can the area be designed or intended to be usedfor residential purposes; and (5) the juvenile must be under continuousvisual supervision by a law enforcement officer or facility staff duringthe period of time that he or she is in nonsecure custody.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Policy: Criteria for Court Holding Facilities</ITAG>A court holding facility is a secure facility, other than an adult jailor lockup, that is used to temporarily detain persons immediately beforeor after detention hearings, or other court proceedings. Court holdingfacilities, where they do not detail individuals overnight (i.e., are notresidential) and are not used for punitive purposes or other purposes unrelatedto a court appearance, are not considered adult jails or lockups for purposesof section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act. However, such facilities remainsubject to the section 223(a)(13) (42 U.S.C. 5633(a)(13)) separation requirementof the Act.<ITAG tagnum="6">Verne L.
