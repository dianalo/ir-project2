The move would help Motorola hedge a huge bet it has madein the memory-chip area. It also would give IBM anotherdomestic supplier of memory chips, and it would helpstrengthen the beleaguered U.S. semiconductor industry.</LP><TEXT>   The pairing would be a natural one, because IBM andMotorola already have a research agreement covering someadvanced semiconductor technology. Any agreement also wouldcontinue a trend in which IBM has shared its semiconductortechnology with U.S. and European companies to strengthenthem against Japanese competitors that IBM fears may becometoo powerful.   For instance, the technology that would be licensed toMotorola -- for four-megabit dynamic random access memorychips, or DRAMS, the densest now in commercial use -- isalready licensed to Micron Technology Inc. IBM also hadplanned to license the technology to U.S. Memories, theill-fated consortium of U.S. chip makers and consumers.   Both Motorola and IBM declined to confirm or otherwisecomment on their licensing negotiations, which were firstreported yesterday in the New York Times.   Some consultants and securities analysts speculated thatMotorola is attempting to reduce its dependence on ToshibaCorp., with which it already has an agreement covering chiptechnology. They said that Motorola may be trying to protectthe huge investments it has made in DRAM factories in theevent that there are problems with implementing Toshiba'sdesign. By licensing the IBM design, Motorola would be simplylining up a backup technology to ensure that those factoriesget up and running, they said.   &quot;Motorola is making way too big a bet to depend on asingle technology, especially one from a partner that's 6,000miles away,&quot; said Drew Peck of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Corp. &quot;This way, either Toshiba's or IBM'stechnology will come through, and they'll be okay.&quot;   Analysts also speculated that the Motorola move may put adamper on the recent rush by U.S. companies to find Japanesepartners. Five major U.S.-Japanese joint ventures insemiconductors have been announced since January.   &quot;This certainly is going to cause some people to thinktwice about the commitments they're making,&quot; said WillStrauss of Forward Concepts Co., a Tempe, Ariz.,market-research firm.   Like some other analysts, Mr. Strauss pointed to a growingperception that Japanese companies may be getting the betterdeal in such technology-sharing partnerships. &quot;If it turnsout that Motorola isn't happy with a relationship that's afew years old, people will be more cautious about gettinginto these deals,&quot; he said.   Officials from both Motorola and Toshiba denied anydiscord between their companies. &quot;Toshiba has been a veryhonorable, very equitable partner,&quot; a Motorola spokesmansaid.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Motorola shares closed at $85.50, up 37.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
