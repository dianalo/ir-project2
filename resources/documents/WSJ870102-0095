According to a survey by the National Association of Accountants, 43% of the controllers and managers responsible for corporate budgets and financial forecasts predicted the economy will be about the same a year from now. Another 28% said things would be worse. Only 20% felt that the economy would fare better.    But when asked about revenue prospects for their own companies, 68% of the officers said they expect higher results in 1987, with a median increase of about 10%. Just 12% said they expect their firm's revenue to decline. Nearly half -- 47% -- of the executives agreed, however, that changes in the tax laws will hurt corporate earnings.    The National Association of Accountants is an association of management accountants and financial managers.    The executives predicted that inflation would be about 4% in 1987. The majority also said both long-term and short-term interest rates are likely to increase or remain the same.    These prognostications, the executives said, would be reflected in a midyear Dow Jones Industrial Average of between 1900 and 1920, about the current level. </TEXT></DOC>
