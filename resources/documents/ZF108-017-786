E. &quot;Pete&quot; Peterson,WordPerfect's executive vice president, &quot;but the two products will look as ifthey came from one company.&quot;andM;1-2-3/G is scheduled for release in the first quarter; WordPerfect forPresentation Manager should be available by mid-summer.andP;  The agreement, bothcompanies admitted, might limit the future of Lotus's Manuscript wordprocessor and WordPerfect's PlanPerfect spreadsheet.andP;  For more on theLotus-WordPerfect announcement, see @Lotus, page 26.andP;  For more on 1-2-3/G,see &quot;A First Look at 1-2-3/G, Lotus's Spreadsheet for OS/2 PresentationManager&quot; on page 6.andM;A Microsoft and IBM detenteandM;The significance of the Lotus-WordPerfect agreement was heightened by a jointMicrosoft-IBM announcement.andP;  Speaking at a packed press conference, IBM VicePresident James A. Cannavino and Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates announced thatafter mid-1990, Microsoft will ship each new OS/2 application either beforeor simultaneously with its Microsoft Windows counterpart, if there is one.andO;That is, new products and features will show up first for OS/2 PresentationManager and may then be retrofitted for Windows.andP;  Furthermore, IBM intends tomake its Extended Edition enhancements to OS/2 available to all StandardEdition users and developers.andP;  For more on the Microsoft-IBM announcement,see &quot;Sorting Out Graphical User Interfaces&quot; on page 9.andM;As Microsoft cut back on future Windows development plans, Intel pressed itscampaign to kill off its own successful 80286 chip in favor of the 80386.andO;Intel's goal is widely ascribed to the company's position as the sole sourceof the '386 chip.andP;  The '286 chip, on the other hand, is made under license byseveral competing firms.andM;Intel's chip-switch effort may be tougher than you'd think.andP;  According toMichael Slater, editor and publisher of Microprocessor Report, a Palo Alto,Calif., newsletter, despite Intel's efforts to undermine the '286 chip,customers continue to order record numbers of them.andM;Nonetheless, the IBM-Microsoft position may help Intel's effort bystrengthening the view that an 80386 or i486 machine with several megabytesof memory and at least a VGA display should be considered the basicbusiness-computing platform for the early 1990s.andP;  IBM's Senior Vice PresidentGeorge H. Conrades described the &quot;platform for the '90s&quot; as a '386- or'486-based machine with 4 megabytes of RAM and at least a 60-megabyte harddrive running OS/2 Presentation Manager.andM;The multimedia messageandM;IBM also strengthened its position in the burgeoning field of multimedia, inwhat IBM spokesman Peter Blakeney admitted was a deliberate attempt to layclaim to territory that has popularly been ceded to Apple Computer.andP;  IBM usedthe keynote speech by George Conrades and a large part of its giant booth toemphasize that the firm has current products and a serious commitment tofuture product efforts in multimedia.andP;  Using stereo sound, a touchscreen, andfull-motion video, Conrades delivered the message that technology isworthless unless it relates to real user needs.andM;Meanwhile, Intel supported its own claims of multimedia technology with DVI(Digital Video Interactive) technology.andP;  Intel featured its recentlyannounced RTV (Real Time Video) version 1.5, a combination of custom chipsand software that enables a PS/2 computer to digitize and compress videoimages in real time.andP;  DVI can produce a CD-ROM (compact disk, read-onlymemory) consisting of 72 minutes of full-color, full-motion video ofsufficient quality for training or industrial use.andP;  Intel DVI chief RobertBrannon promised that continued development of the technology would make itwidely affordable within the next few years.andP;  By 1993, he said, such a systemwould be available for less than $1,000.andM;Plans for the i486 move aheadandM;On the i486 front, Intel flatly denied having problems with the chip, and bugreports don't seem to have scared off manufacturers.andP;  Compaq Computer Corp.andO;demonstrated the Deskpro 486/25, a 25-MHz '486 microprocessor that has beenFCC-approved but is not yet available.andP;  Corollary Inc. (Irvine, Calif.)andO;showed a system that can be configured with 10 of the new processors, andPresident George White said he has sold OEM versions of his product to MitacInternational Corp. of Taiwan and to Zenith Data Systems (which may be ownedby France's Groupe Bull by the time you read this).andP;  He talked freely aboutthe bug reports: &quot;It's overblown.andP;  With the newest revised chip, we're seeingvirtually no problems.&quot;andM;Intel may be taking a stand on chips, but it was among the many industrysuppliers who refused to take sides on the question of which bus the newhigh-performance chips should support--IBM's Micro Channel Architecture orthe Extended Industry Standard Architecture of Compaq and other vendors.andP;  Butthen, many observers say that the issue of MCA versus EISA is now moot.andP;  AsJan Lewis, president of Lewis Research Corp. (Sunnyvale, Calif.), summed itup, &quot;It is possible that both EISA and MCA will succeed.&quot;andM;IBM's Conrades declared the bus wars over, and IBM and Compaq have nowcross-licensed their bus designs.andP;  Machines based on both technologies werescattered around the floor.andP;  Unofficial counts gave EISA the majority ofbooths but gave MCA the lead in current shipments and number of add-ons.andM;Laptop compromisesandM;Perhaps, too, the lack of fire in the EISA-versus-MCA controversy can beattributed to the large number of introductions of portable machines withoutany standard buses at all.andP;  From hand-held computers to laptops with colorflat-panel display screens, more than 50 portable computers graced the hallsand aisles.andM;Among the apparent hits were the $400 Atari Portfolio, designed in England,and the Poqet PC, a $1,995 handheld unit from Poqet Computer, a Sunnyvale,Calif., company that is 38% owned by Fujitsu.andP;  Both weighed about a pound butgot there with compromises like credit card-size RAM and ROM cards instead ofdisk drives, and keyboards only a Lilliputian could love.andP;  However, the Poqetmade up for its undersize keyboard with a two-month battery life.andP;  Like thePoqet and Portfolio, the 4-pound Psion models MC-200, MC-400, and MC-600,from England's Psion Ltd., also traded disk drives for plug-in memory cardsand backlighting for longer battery life.andM;The no-compromise laptops weighed 6 pounds.andP;  The Compaq LTE, with many partsmade by Citizen Watch Co. of Japan, was typical.andP;  It has a 20-megabyte harddisk and a 3-1/2-inch disk drive, as well as a backlit screen and adesktop-quality keyboard.andP;  A similar machine, the MinisPort from Zenith DataSystems, drew poor reviews for its nonstandard 2-inch disk drive.andM;Tandy's Grid Systems (Fremont, Calif.) showed the GridPad, the first portableto recognize handwriting.andP;  Using a pen-like marker, you can fill in a form onthe GridPad screen, which converts your handwriting to typed characters.andM;The Russians are comingandM;As well as perestroika in the laptop market, Comdex was a showcase forsoftware glasnost.andP;  Partnerships and cross-licensing are in, lawsuits areout.andP;  Software Products International (San Diego, Calif.) announced a jointventure with the Soviet Academy of Sciences to market officially translatedversions of PC software programs in the Soviet Union, starting with SPI'sOpen Access II and Open Access II Network.andP;  As part of the new venture,dubbed Intersoft, SPI will market English versions of Russian software inthis country.andM;Another Soviet firm, GlasnostSoft (with a U.S.andP;  office in San Francisco),demonstrated a business word processor called PolyText.andP;  &quot;It's true that mysoftware may not be as powerful as some of the American programs,&quot; saidArkady Borkovsky, &quot;but it unifies file functions, as well as textinformation, and it supports 31 simultaneous resizable windows.&quot;andM;Not only the Russians, but the Indians are coming.andP;  Comdex is a grand displayof silicon wealth, but U.S.andP;  companies harbor a fear of cheap-labor productsthat will turn their advantages back into sand.andP;  This year it's the softwarewriters' turn to worry, as India staked its claim in the software market.andO;One Indian entrepreneur, the owner of a Calcutta company called Zoom 16,claimed he could write a custom program for 1/13 of what American companiescharge.andM;For the more prosaic jobs of storing and backing up your files--foreign orotherwise--more than half a dozen firms showed 1.2-gigabyte tape storageunits that are based on digital audio tape (DAT) and 8-millimetervideo-recording technology.andP;  Just about every medium showed new highs incapacity, from the 20-megabyte 3-1/2-inch floppy disks from Brier Technologyand Insite Peripherals, both of San Jose, Calif., to a 1-inch papertapewrite-once system that stores 1.2 gigabytes (1,200 megabytes), shown by ICIImagedata (Wilmington, Del.).andM;Backing up your files should be easier with a new Peter Norton Computing(Santa Monica, Calif.) program called The Norton Backup, which claims toprotect against data loss by making backups against hard-disk failure, virusdamage, or user &quot;accident.&quot;andP;  Norton said it automatically configures itselfto its environment and offers four levels of data compression and threelevels of data verification.andP;  Norton added it will even recover data fromdamaged backup disks, and it will work automatically on single machines,networks, or any other DOS device, all for $149.andM;In the modem market, peace is at hand over standards while the war has begunover prices.andP;  All major vendors offered 9,600-bps dial-up modems followingCCITT standards called V.32, V.42, and V.42bis, giving them an effectivespeed of 38,400 bits per second, using compression.andP;  The price starts high,at $1,199 for the Hayes V-series Ultra Smartmodem 9600 and $1,045 forUniversal Data Systems' FasTalk V.32/42.andP;  But there's good news, as well:U.S.andP;  Robotics cut its modem prices 27%, and Hayes offers its UltraSmartmodem 9600 to qualified bulletin board operators at $599.andM;Fax machines and moreandM;Fax modems and fax machines are also on the rise.andP;  Many of the major Japaneseprinter makers added fax machines to their booths this year, with most ofthem promising fax-to-PC links by Comdex/Spring '90.andP;  One clever solution isthe JetFax from Hybrid Fax (Menlo Park, Calif.), which plugs into aHewlett-Packard or compatible laser printer and lets any PC user connected tothe printer receive laser-printed faxes.andP;  Accompanying software lets youcreate phone directories, perform mail-merge functions, and broadcast a faxto a mailing list.andM;Another solution is SmarterFax, from Electronic Modules (Dallas).andP;  One modelsimply lets a fax machine share a phone line with a telephone and a modem.andO;But a memory-expanded version lets you deliver faxes to mailing lists,maintain confidential mailboxes, and retrieve the contents of your mailboxfrom any remote location.andM;Nissei Electric U.S.A., a Japanese firm that makes its U.S.andP;  home in Closter,N.J., introduced new products called SF 100 and Letterfax.andP;  The formerretails for $1,495 and combines the functions of a scanner and a fax machine.andO;The latter, $1,195, weighs just 7-1/2 pounds and can be used as both aprinter and a fax machine by any laptop computer.andM;In hard-copy output, low-cost laser printers, led by the Hewlett-PackardLaserJet IIP, attracted steady interest.andP;  But despite predictions thatlow-cost lasers would lead to the demise of the dot-matrix, many printermakers were featuring new dot-matrix models.andP;  Full-color printers usingink-jet and dye-transfer methods were also in good supply, with prices forcolor PostScript models finally breaking the $10,000 level.andM;For boosting the speed of your laser printer, Eicon Technology Corp. ofMontreal announced a new PostScript-compatible controller using Intel'srecently introduced i960 chip.andP;  Marc Jette, Eicon's vice president of imagesystems, said the new EiconScript controller card can pass a page from PC toprinter in just 15 to 20 seconds.andP;  And that speed will be increased greatlynext year, he added, through software optimization.andM;However, not every trend was marked by rising performance or a flourishingdiversity of products.andP;  The influence of Unix on the business desktopcomputer, for example, was more conspicuous by its absence than by itspresence, as were artificial intelligence products.andP;  Despite a strong effortby key Unix distributor The Santa Cruz Operation to put Unix on '386 and '486systems, a map of Comdex made by that firm showing where to find such systemsshowed relatively few islands of color.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
