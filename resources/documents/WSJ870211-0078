Owens-Illinois had spurned a $55-a-share leveraged buyout bid from Kohlberg Kravis, and a subsequent $60-a-share bid had deeply divided its board. While management directors had encouraged Kohlberg Kravis, some outside directors were bitterly opposed to forfeiting the company's independence, according to sources close to the transaction.    But Kohlberg Kravis's latest offer was apparently rich enough to quell dissent on the board, which met for most of the day Monday in New York to consider the bid. In addition to throwing in an extra 50 cents a share, Kohlberg Kravis also added luster to its proposal by offering to pay all cash. Its previous bids included $6.50 to $11.50 a share in securities.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Owen-Illinois' stock closed at $59.75, down 25 cents, on volume of 1,137,500 shares.    Wall Street sources said Owens's investment bankers sought other prospective bidders over the past three weeks but weren't able to find a better offer. In addition, the sources said, Owens-Illinois wasn't able to top the shareholder appeal of Kohlberg Kravis's latest bid with a restructuring proposed last month.    Kohlberg Kravis, Wall Street's leading architect of leveraged buyouts, said it will launch a tender offer soon for Owens-Illinois' common. The investment firm said it will also offer $363 for each of Owens-Illinois' roughly 71,000 of $4.75 convertible preference shares.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company largely with borrowed money. The debt is ultimately paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sales of its assets.    In an earlier proposal Kohlberg Kravis indicated that Owens-Illinois managers would be invited to be equity participants in the buyout. Yesterday, neither company would disclose what role managers would have in the transaction, but a Kohlberg Kravis spokesman said, &quot;It would be unusual for management not to be invited to invest.&quot;    Wall Street sources said Kohlberg doesn't plan any major overhauls of Owens-Illinois' management.    Kohlberg Kravis is expected to consider selling some Owens-Illinois assets to reduce the enormous debt the buyout will produce. As part of the restructuring it proposed last month to fend off Kohlberg Kravis, Owens-Illinois directors approved selling $1 billion of assets, including the forest products division. Over the past year, amid sweeping restructuring throughout the forest products industry, Owens-Illinois sold parts of that division, which consists of paper mills, linerboard plants and timberland.    It isn't clear whether Kohlberg Kravis will proceed with the asset sales that Owens-Illinois planned. Edward Schollmeyer, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst, estimated that a sale of the company's forest products business could generate about $700 million. The division contributed about one-fifth of Owens-Illinois' $3.67 billion of revenue in 1985, the last year for which the company has broken out division figures.    Analysts say other logical parts of Owens-Illinois for Kohlberg Kravis to sell include its overseas glass-container operations and its financial service business. The company also has interests in nursing homes.    To pay for the buyout, Kohlberg Kravis will turn to a $3.27 billion package of bank financing led by Bankers Trust Co. In addition, affiliates of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. have agreed to provide a short-term loan of $600 million, which will be repaid over the next 18 months through an issue of high-yield bonds. Such &quot;bridge loans&quot; are an increasingly common element in takeovers, as aggressive investment banks agree to put up their own capital to win financing business.    In addition, Kohlberg Kravis will put $380 million of its own money into the buyout, Wall Street sources said.    In announcing acceptance of Kohlberg Kravis's offer, Owens-Illinois said its board agreed to redeem stock purchase rights it distributed to shareholders two years ago under a &quot;poison pill&quot; anti-takeover plan. Owens-Illinois also said it agreed with Kohlberg Kravis to discontinue the payment of dividends on its common shares. </TEXT></DOC>
