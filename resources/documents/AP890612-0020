Deputy prosecutor Giorgio Santacroce contends officials at twomilitary radar centers may have destroyed essential radar tapes,lied to investigators and illegally suppressed the truth.   He asked Magistrate Vittorio Bucarelli on Saturday to notify theofficials they were under investigation in connection with the June27, 1980 crash that killed all 81 people aboard.   The DC-9 jetliner of the domestic carrier Itavia was on a flightfrom Bologna to Palermo, Sicily, when an explosion sent it plunginginto the Tyrrhenian Sea.   A commission of experts appointed by Bucarelli, who is in chargeof the investigation, concluded in March that the airliner was hitby a missile fired by an unidentified warplane.   However, another commission appointed by Premier Ciriaco De Mitasaid last month that a bomb may have been smuggled aboard thejetliner.   Italian news agencies said Santacroce is investigating thepossibility that the commander of the military radar center atLicola ordered the destruction of crucial radar tapes made the dayof the crash.   The agencies said he also was considering charging 22 servicemenat the radar centers at Licola and Marsala, Sicily, with suppressionof evidence, perjury or complicity.   Santacroce told Bucarelli that there was a ``strong suspicion''that key radar tapes had been altered.   The prosecutor noted what he called an unexplained disappearancefrom the monitor of radar tracks fundamental to the investigation,and a ``hole'' of eight minutes in the tapes.   Government officials, including Defense Minister Valerio Zanone,have vigorously denied any government coverup of the disaster andalso have denied an Italian warplane could have been involved.   The commission appointed by the premier also said it receivedassurances from the Defense Ministry and NATO that no militaryexercises were under way in the area at the time of the crash.   It said the United States, France, Britain, West Germany andIsrael also said they had no ships or planes in the area at the time.   Twenty days after the crash, the wreckage of a Libyan warplanewas found in southern Italy. The discovery led to speculation thatthe Libyan jet either fired or had been the target of the missile.However, an Italian judge recently said he found no evidence tosupport the theory.</TEXT></DOC>
