This paper will discuss how the Midwestmight fare under conditions of higher mean temperatures or a major federalcontrol program; it also discusses some of the research and developmentactivities underway at Argonne National Laboratory that could help developa balanced portfolio of technologies for combating the greenhouse effect.For the purposes of this paper we have defined a six-state region--consistingof the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin--totypify the Midwest. These are the same states that comprise Federal Region5. Temperatures were averaged for the thirty-year period 1950--1980 anddo not include some of the higher summer temperatures we have been experiencingin the 1980s. 15 refs., 8 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
