Here was South Africa's smiling, white defenseminister, in what is still an apartheid government, minglingwith black children in Thokoza, a violence-torn township.   But none of the children around Roelof Meyer knew who hewas. When told, one reportedly asked: &quot;Malan?&quot; Magnus Malan,61 years old, is the career soldier who held the job from1980 until Mr. Meyer, 44, took over three months ago. Theyare nothing alike.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Meyer brings youth and moderation to a ministry manyfeel Gen. Malan allowed to wallow in the racism of the past.His appointment seems designed to help change the ministry'sreputation -- and indeed the nation's -- as the countrystruggles to become a &quot;new South Africa.&quot;   It is a formidable task as this civilian with almost nomilitary experience takes over a complex military apparatusthat still is known more for defending white supremacythrough foreign aggression and internal operations than fordefending the nation's majority.   Mr. Meyer faces daunting challenges. The internationalforays apparently are over, but the South African DefenseForce is accused of complicity in black township violence. Itis a ministry battered by a 30% budget cut over the last twoyears. And it isn't clear how the SADF and the AfricanNational Congress army will interact as South Africa movestoward democracy.   Some question Mr. Meyer's ability to handle the job. Buthe may not have to handle the job alone. His appointmentclearly places responsibility for the defense force withPresident F.W. de Klerk, who has his own man heading theministry for the first time since becoming president twoyears ago.   Lack of military experience may be an asset as Mr. Meyermoves to put his stamp on the defense force. In addition tomeeting the principle that the military should be undercivilian control, his appointment will help give the SADF &quot;abit more credibility in the eyes of the public,&quot; says retiredRear Admiral Chris Bennett.   The army's credibility is mixed in the townships, but itgenerally has a better reputation than the police. &quot;To me, itis absolutely important, especially in view of the wayforward, that we clear the military of all politicalinclinations,&quot; Mr. Meyer says.   In his only other military experience, Mr. Meyer was a&quot;canary.&quot; He spent one year of voluntary service as a choirmember stationed in the air force gymnasium. Peter Gastrow, aDemocratic Party member of Parliament, says Mr. Meyer is&quot;just too much of a lightweight&quot; to handle the generals. Mr.Meyer says such comments are but &quot;water on a duck's back.&quot;   Others who have worked with Mr. Meyer, or negotiatedagainst him, see him differently. &quot;He's a tough negotiator,very, very tough,&quot; says Chris Hani, chief of staff ofUmkhonto we Sizwe, the military force of the ANC, SouthAfrica's main pro-democracy group. &quot;The significance of hisappointment is that he would want the security forces to bebehind the negotiation process. It is useful that he replacesMalan.&quot;   Mr. Meyer, previously deputy minister for constitutionaldevelopment and planning, has been at the center ofnegotiations between the government and the ANC since the banon the ANC was removed on Feb. 2, 1990. Before that, he wasdeputy minister of law and order. In that role he chaired acouncil overseeing all governmental undertakings -- includingpolice, military and welfare activities -- aimed at puttingdown the rebellion in black townships. &quot;His decisions veryobviously affected the extent of arrests and detentions,&quot;said an analyst who worked with Mr. Meyer during his 1986 to1988 stint with law and order.   The council he headed then was known as the National JointManagement Center. &quot;He ran that committee with a firm hand,surprisingly so,&quot; said a colleague. &quot;He was dealing with hardmen, generals. He dealt with them very firmly and veryauthoritatively.&quot;   But Mr. Hani thinks &quot;it's unfair to bring the baggage ofthe past when we are assessing individuals. Times change.Virtually the whole of the National Party was involved inserious crimes of the past.&quot;   Since serving as national president of an Afrikanerstudent organization, Mr. Meyer has developed a reputation asa faithful National Party follower, one who has more moderateviews than some in the party, but not one who would rock theboat in pushing the leadership away from apartheid any fasterthan it wanted to go.   According to Johan Fick, a Meyer colleague in collegepolitics, the student group was &quot;aligned to typical NationalParty thinking in those years,&quot; which, of course, supportedwhite supremacist rule. Yet, while Mr. Meyer was president,the group made contact with black student associations forthe first time. And when an ultra-conservative factionthreatened to split the National Party, the studentorganization remained in the fold under Mr. Meyer'sleadership.   He &quot;tried to stay clear from both poles,&quot; Mr. Fickrecalls. He &quot;stayed on the middle road.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
