In other incidents in the occupied territories, assailants shotand killed a Palestinian suspected of cooperating with Israel, andIsraeli soldiers reportedly shot and wounded 10 Palestinians.Another Palestinian, a 14-year-old boy, was shot in the head byJewish settlers, Arab reports said.   The driver of the car that exploded near police headquarters inJerusalem was hospitalized with severe burns. There were no otherinjuries.   The car's trunk was loaded with six containers of kerosene andtwo canisters of cooking gas, said police spokesman Uzi Sandori.The man was seen holding a detonator just before the vehicleexploded, he added.   Police believe the car was being rigged as a bomb and went offprematurely. ``We believe it might be a terrorist act thatfailed,'' said Sandori.   He identified the driver as a Palestinian from east Jerusalem'sShoafat district who has a criminal record for disturbing thepeace. Sandori did not release the name of the man, a veterinarianwho once worked for the city.   The army, meanwhile, confirmed a man died Friday when he wasshot in the mouth and head in the crowded main square of the WestBank city of Nablus. A spokesman said they still are checking thecircumstances.   Palestinian reporters said the victim, Kamel Abu Samt, 38, wassuspected of collaborating with Israel.   His death brings to at least 40 the number of suspectedcollaborators killed by fellow Palestinians since the December 1987start of the uprising against Israeli occupation. Another 415Palestinians have been shot and killed by Israeli troops.Palestinians have killed 18 Israelis in that time.   At Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital, 14-year-old Nader Mohammed AbuHamdia was in serious condition after being shot Friday by Jewishsettlers in the West Bank town of Hebron, Arab reports said.   An army spokeswoman confirmed a Hebron resident washospitalized, and said authorities are investigating how he wasinjured.   Another gang of about 50 heavily armed West Bank settlersmarched through Jerusalem's Arab neighborhood of Silwan on Friday.Some waved Israeli flags and shouted in Hebrew and Arabic: ``TheJews are here! The Jews are here!''   When about half a dozen Palestinian boys aged 8-10 stoned themfrom a nearby hilltop, the settlers held their submachine guns upin warning.   The marchers then alerted police who fired tear gas to dispersethe stone throwers.   Israel radio said downtown Hebron was declared a closed militaryarea after a series of clashes between soldiers and stone-throwingPalestinians on Friday. Two Palestinians were wounded by armygunfire, the radio said.   An army spokeswoman also confirmed troops wounded a Palestinianwoman during clashes in Nablus.   She said she is checking Arab hospital reports that seven otherPalestinians were shot and wounded by troops in confrontations inthe Gaza Strip.   Also Friday, an army investigation found the use of gunfire byborder police during a search-and-arrest raid in the West Bankvillage of Nahalin was ``exaggerated,'' Israel radio said.   The 25 border policemen fired 150 live bullets, killing fivepeople and wounding at least 15 during the April 13 incident, theradio quoted the report as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
