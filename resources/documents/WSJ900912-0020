In a nationally televised speech focusing on the PersianGulf crisis, the president said, &quot;The Congress should, thismonth, enact measures to increase domestic energy productionand energy conservation in order to reduce dependence onforeign oil.&quot; Listing &quot;our energy dependence&quot; among factorsdetermining &quot;whether we can help our friends and stand up toour foes,&quot; he vowed that &quot;Americans must never again enterany crisis -- economic or military -- with an excessivedependence on foreign oil.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The Bush administration is expected to release this week aseries of specific proposals that were produced by the EnergyDepartment and approved by the White House economic policycommittee. Department officials have said the package will belonger-term and more controversial than an earlier package,which included calls for Americans to inflate their car tiresmore fully and increase car-pooling, and was roundlydismissed as inadequate by conservation groups.   The new proposals drawn up by the department include a taxcredit designed to encourage efforts to recover hard-to-getoil from existing fields, and an extension and reshaping of atax credit for investments in renewable energy projects suchas solar power. The administration also will reproposevarious tax incentives for oil drilling that were included inthe president's budget proposal last January. These includechanges that would reduce the burden of the alternativeminimum tax on producers.   Any of these revenue-losing measures, however, would facean uphill battle in Congress at a time the lawmakers aretrying to rein in a budget deficit that is spiraling out ofcontrol. The tax changes in the January budget were estimatedto cost $300 million in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.   The president also may urge various federal agencies toexpedite the permitting process required for certain oildrilling projects in the Beaufort Sea near Alaska and renewhis call for Congress to allow oil drilling in the ArcticNatural Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. In his speech, thepresident urged Congress &quot;to accelerate the development ofAlaskan energy resources, without damage to wildlife.&quot;Environmentalists are already vigorously attacking proposalsto open up the refuge, however.   In addition, the administration may seek to speed up itsconsideration of proposed pipeline projects designed to bringnatural gas into California for use in projects designed torecover hard-to-get oil. Actual production from such projectswould be some time off, though, according to agencyofficials.   Among steps proposed by the Energy Department to encourageconservation are calls for Americans to use gasoline withlower-octane ratings. Octane measures the anti-knock capacityof gasoline.   The president also called for efforts to increasefuel-switching. Higher oil prices are already persuadingindustries with dual-fuel capacity to switch to natural gasfrom oil. Energy Department officals have looked at ways toremove barriers, such as transportation problems, that couldinhibit further switching.   In addition, the president may issue an executive ordercalling for increased energy efficiency and reduced energyconsumption in federal buildings, and the Bush administrationmay urge people to tune up oil burners and replace them asneeded.</TEXT></DOC>
