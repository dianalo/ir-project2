Despite public threats by U.S. officials in recent weeks, the cabinet-level Economic Policy Council has decided not to impose any immediate U.S. sanctions against the European aircraft consortium. European reaction to U.S. pressure has been strong, and U.S. officials decided that too strident an approach might backfire.    At the same time, however, the council ordered U.S. trade officials to request formal consultations with the Europeans under the Geneva, Switzerland-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The talks would consider whether Airbus is violating provisions of the GATT aircraft code that covers the introduction and pricing of new models.    The Economic Policy Council also asked the subcabinet-level Trade Policy Review Group to evaluate allegations by U.S. aircraft makers that Airbus is trying to &quot;disrupt&quot; the introduction of the MD-11, a long-range, wide-body plane being marketed by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. of St. Louis. And it ordered &quot;day-to-day&quot; monitoring of Airbus's efforts to market its own long-range wide-bodies, the A-340 and A-330.    U.S. officials said the steps are meant to put the Europeans &quot;on alert&quot; that Washington still is serious about the McDonnell Douglas complaint, even though the administration has decided not to retaliate now.    A senior U.S. trade official said during the weekend that despite Washington's decision to revert to a low-key approach, U.S. retaliation &quot;remains a live option.&quot; The administration is expected to decide the retaliation question within a few weeks.    The dispute has been escalating for months following Airbus Industrie's announcement that it plans to enter the market for long-range, wide-body planes. Washington contends that the market is too small for both companies to succeed, and argues that Airbus's competition is unfair because the consortium receives heavy government subsidies. Airbus is financed jointly by Britain, France and West Germany.    But the Europeans contend that U.S. aircraft makers are subsidized, too, because they benefit from military contracts that finance technological development that can be used in production of civilian aircraft.    U.S. officials said they thought they had an agreement from the Europeans earlier this year to stop using government pressure or special inducements, such as offering landing rights to potential buyers, in marketing the A-340 and A-330. But they say the Europeans have reneged.    They also say that Airbus may be violating the GATT aircraft code, which forbids governments from financing new aircraft projects unless the venture is likely to be profitable and provides a reasonable rate of return to investors. Calling for bilateral consultations is the first step toward filing a formal complaint under the code.    Two weeks ago, U.S. officials visited London, Bonn and Paris in an effort to increase pressure on the Europeans. For the first time, they raised the possibility that the U.S. might file anti-dumping and countervailing-duty petitions if U.S. demands weren't met.    European reaction was severe. French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac last week accused the U.S. of economic &quot;hostage taking&quot; in issuing its threats, and warned that Europe would respond with &quot;real retaliatory measures&quot; if the U.S. imposed any sanctions.    Production of the new Airbus wide-bodies began last week. </TEXT></DOC>
