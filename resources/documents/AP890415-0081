Spokesman Jan Bisztyga announced 1,749 party delegates willattend a party convention next month to approve candidates andpositions. He also said the party was considering whether memberswill be allowed to join a legal Solidarity trade union.   ``During this election campaign, we would like society to learnmore about the party as the initiator of reforms,'' Bisztyga told anews conference after the brief party meeting. ``We would like toprove that the party stands behind the reforms.''   The meeting of the 230-member party Central Committee was thefirst since communist authorities and the opposition agreed April 5to hold partially free elections to parliament and restore thelegal status of Solidarity _ the Soviet bloc's first independenttrade union.   The party's first secretary, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, openedand closed the meeting at party headquarters, the official PAP newsagency reported.   A brief PAP statement said the Central Committee took decisionson the parliamentary elections and May 4-5 party conference.   He said the party was considering whether to allow its 2.3million members to join Solidarity. The trade movement applied forlegal registration Thursday, and it is expected to be grantedMonday.   Jaruzelski's decision to accept a legal Solidarity was adoptedonly after a stormy party meeting in mid-January.   Legalizing Solidarity marks a reversal in the party's attitudetoward the opposition, which it had tried to eliminate for sevenyears after a December 1981 martial-law crackdown.   Saturday's meeting also debated party campaign strategy in theparliamentary elections. The elections are scheduled in two stages:the first stage on June 4 and a runoff vote June 18.   The elections will be the first time in the history of thecommunist state that candidates can run for parliament withoutfirst having been approved by the party.   Under the new electoral law, the party and its allies will beguaranteed 65 percent of the seats in the 460-member Sejm, thepresent one-house parliament, with the other 35 percent to beopenly contested by independent, non-party candidates. All seats ofthe new 100-member Senate are to be freely contested betweencommunists and independents.   Bisztyga said the division of seats among the communist partyand its allies, the Peasants' Party and the Democratic Party, wasunder discussion and would be announced before an April 25 deadlineset by the Council of State.</TEXT></DOC>
