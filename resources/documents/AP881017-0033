General Assembly on Tuesday.   Roh left today to address the United Nations for the first timeas a South Korean head of state.   Prior to his departure, Roh told a news conference he willunveil a new policy of unification between South and North Koreaand a ``northern policy'' aimed at improving relations withcommunist countries such as the Soviet Union and China.   Seoul has been trying to improve relations with Moscow, Beijingand other communist countries hoping that it would have a positiveeffect on reunfication efforts.   These communist countries have so far been allies of NorthKorea, although some of them, such as the Soviet Union and Hungary,recently agreed to exchnage trade offices or permanent missionswith Seoul.   The capitalist south has no diplomatic ties with any communistcountry.   Following the U.N. address Roh will fly to Washington to lunchwith President Reagan on Thursday. Those talks will also focuss onKorean peace efforts, Seoul officials said.   South and North Korea are not U.N. members, but the world bodyhas decided to hear speeches from both. North Korea's first deputyminister of foreign affairs, Kang Sok Ju, speaks Wednesday.   The two Koreas have been bitter enemies since their land wasdivided at the end of World War II in 1945. They still aretechnically at war, since no peace treaty was signed after theKorean War in 1950-53 ended in an armistice.   The two Korean states have held rapprochement talks on an offsince the early 1970s but failed to make progress. Lawmakers ofboth sides began talks in August with little progress.   One senior government party official, requesting anonymity, saidRoh's speech may cover some sensitive matters, including armsreductions by the two Koreas, which Seoul officials have so farbeen reluctant to discuss openly.   In his latest peace proposal early this month, Roh renewed acall for summit talks with North Korean President Kim Il Sung, andsaid he is ready to end rivalry and confrontation.   ``Circumstances affecting unification have changed completelyfrom the past,'' Roh said in a major policy speech two days afterthe Seoul Olympics ended Oct. 2.   The president said the Olympics, which attracted athletes from arecord 160 countries, including most communist-bloc nations, haveenhanced South Korea's stature in the international society andboosted chances for improved relations with North Korea.   Improved relations between East and West and the Soviet Unionand China are also creating a favorable environment for Seoul andPyongyang to thaw 40 years of icy relations, he said.   Roh said his government was drafting a new unification formula,which he said ``should be practicable and acceptable to bothsides.''   Observers in Seoul think Roh may drop hints at or even outlineSouth Korea's new unification formula.   Not surprisingly, Roh's recent peace initiatives have receivedcool response from North Korea, which always prefers a quicklump-sum political settlement of issues to gradual, step-by-stepapproaches being pushed by South Korea.   But, in what appeared to be somewhat encouraging development,North Korea conditionally welcomed Roh's proposal for aninter-Korea summit, according to Seoul officials.   In its first official response to the proposed summit, NorthKorea said Saturday it would welcome Roh to visit Pyongyang onlyafter South Korea has repealed its staunch anti-communist systemand agreed to tackle political and military matters first.   One thorny issue is a North Korean demand for withdrawal of the42,000 U.S. troops stationed in the South. North Korea maintainsthat no thaw in relations with South Korea would be possible aslong as the American troops remain.</TEXT></DOC>
