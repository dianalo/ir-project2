Levente Laszlo, 40 years old, who operates a computer business in Bonn, West Germany, was arrested at O'Hare International Airport. Agents also seized $46,000 of equipment made by Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass. Mr. Laszlo purchased the equipment from a Chicago company that federal sources wouldn't identify. Digital Equipment said it isn't involved in the investigation.    The arrest is part of a continuing investigation by the U.S. Customs Service that has focused for six years on illegal shipments of advanced computers and other high-technology equipment to Soviet bloc countries. The U.S. Department of Commerce prohibits shipments of certain equipment that could be used by the Soviet military.    According to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court here, customs agents learned last September that Mr. Laszlo &quot;has been acquiring high technology computer equipment from the U.S. and western European countries for end-users in Hungary.&quot;    In a conversation that was secretly tape-recorded by an undercover customs agent, Mr. Laszlo allegedly said that his market for computer equipment includes the &quot;Eastern bloc.&quot; He said he ships to Hungary &quot;and from there it goes elsewhere,&quot; according to the complaint.    Mr. Laszlo told an undercover customs agent that he earned $4.4 million last year from his computer business, the complaint said. </TEXT></DOC>
