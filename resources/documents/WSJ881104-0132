The big Dutch chemical group's sales rose 7% to 4.13 billion guilders ($2.07 billion) from 3.87 billion guilders. Latest-quarter sales would have been higher if not for the disposal in the year-ago fourth quarter of the company's consumer-products division.    Akzo predicted it will &quot;significantly exceed&quot; in 1988 its 1987 earnings before extraordinary items of 669 million guilders. After 273 million guilders of special gains, mainly from the sale of the consumer-products unit to Sara Lee Corp., Akzo had 1987 profit of 942 million guilders.    The earnings met the upper end of market expectations. </TEXT></DOC>
