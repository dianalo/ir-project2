The civil suit is one of the first in which the SEC has filed insider-trading charges against investors who &quot;piggy-backed&quot; on someone else's insider trading. In such transactions, the investor doesn't have direct access to the inside information but buys whatever stocks the insider trader has bought. The suit was filed in U.S. district court in Manhattan.    Theodore Levine, a corporate lawyer with the New York firm of Wilmer, Cutler andamp; Pickering, said the courts haven't yet resolved whether piggy-backing falls under insider-trading laws. &quot;The key point is whether the defendant knew or had reason to know that there was inside information,&quot; he said.    The defendants' attorneys, who dispute the allegations, say they will challenge whether such piggy-back transactions violate the federal law against insider trading. The SEC maintains that the case falls within insider-trading precedents because, it alleges, the three defendants either knew or should have known that their trades were based on inside information.    The defendants named in the suit are Brian S. Campbell, 32 years old, formerly a securities account executive at Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner andamp; Smith Inc. and at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.; Carlos A. Zubillaga, 39, formerly a broker in Merrill Lynch's New York and Caracas, Venezuela, offices, and Kevin P. Barry, 33, until late 1985 a corporate attorney in the New York City law firm of Tenzer, Greenblatt, Fallon andamp; Kaplan.    The three are accused of trading on inside information that they indirectly received from Mr. Levine from March 1984 to June 1985. The SEC's suit says information concerning Mr. Levine's trades was passed on to them by Bernhard Meier, who served as Mr. Levine's account executive at Bank Leu International Ltd. Mr. Levine conducted his illegal stock transactions through those accounts, and the SEC says he gave inside information to Mr. Meier.    Mr. Levine pleaded guilty to insider trading and other charges in June 1985. Mr. Meier, who has been barred from the securities business, now lives in Switzerland.    Barry Fallick, an attorney for Mr. Campbell, said the defendants were &quot;piggy-backing on information received elsewhere. Whether that is a violation of the law has yet to be addressed by the courts.&quot; He said his client was notified last year that the SEC planned to file the suit.    Paul Huey-Burns, an SEC branch chief working on the case, however, said, &quot;We believe that {Mr. Campbell, Mr. Zubillaga and Mr. Barry} weren't merely piggy-backing on the trades of Mr. Levine.&quot; He said the defendants' efforts to disguise their trades indicated that they knew the transactions were based on inside information.    Therese D. Pritchard, an assistant director at the SEC, said, &quot;They should have known from the pattern of trading and the identification of the source&quot; that inside information was involved.    It was the stock transactions by Mr. Zubillaga and Mr. Campbell that led the SEC to its investigation of Mr. Levine. In May 1985, Merrill Lynch received an anonymous letter suggesting that some transactions made in the company's Caracas office might be based on inside information involving U.S. stocks. An investigation by Merrill Lynch later found that Mr. Campbell had been trading the same stocks, and that the trading was linked to Bank Leu. Merrill Lynch alerted the SEC, which eventually discovered Mr. Levine's insider-trading scheme.    In the suit filed yesterday, the SEC accused Mr. Campbell, Mr. Zubillaga and Mr. Barry of trading on inside information involving 15 companies, including takeover targets such as G.D. Searle andamp; Co. and Textron Inc.    Although the SEC wouldn't give a total estimate of the defendants' alleged illegal profits, the suit says that in five of the stocks the three men made illegal profits of $397,437. The SEC suit also says that a friend of Mr. Campbell's and relatives of Mr. Barry, including his mother, traded on some of the inside information. The SEC said the friend and relatives made illegal profits of $54,738 on the five stocks.    The SEC's Ms. Pritchard wouldn't say whether charges would be filed against those people.    Said Mark D. Lebow, an attorney who previously represented Mr. Zubillaga: &quot;Mr. Zubillaga cooperated at all times with the SEC's investigation. It was his testimony that began the SEC on the path to Dennis Levine and upward. It is unfair that in exchange for that cooperation the SEC has brought these proceedings.&quot; He said Mr. Zubillaga, a citizen of Venezuela, lives in Caracas.    Mr. Campbell's attorney, Barry Fallick, said his client, who lives in Manhattan, denies the allegations in the suit.    Michael Pelletier, the attorney for Mr. Barry, said he hadn't seen the suit and wouldn't comment. He said Mr. Barry, who met Mr. Campbell while playing basketball in a city league, is a lawyer in Rhinecliff, N.Y.    In its lawsuit, the SEC also accused Mr. Campbell and Mr. Meier of trying to make it appear that the alleged insider trading was based on publicly available information. The suit says that in 1985, when the Levine trading came under investigation, Mr. Campbell gave Mr. Meier old research reports and other material that was used to falsify claims that the Levine transactions were based on publicly available information.    In addition, the SEC accused Mr. Campbell of keeping Mr. Meier posted on the SEC's investigation of the transactions. The lawsuit says Mr. Campbell informed Mr. Meier of inquiries made by the SEC and the compliance departments of Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney.    Lawyers who have followed such cases say there is a fine line between illegal insider trading and piggy-backing that doesn't violate the law. Robert M. Romano, a lawyer with Morgan Lewis andamp; Bockius in New York, said, &quot;Piggy-backing is a tough case to bring. . . . The test is whether or not there came a point in time when the {defendant} knew he was trading based on a tainted source.&quot; He said the circumstances of the case would have to determine whether the defendant should have known.    Stanley Arkin, a lawyer in New York who has defended insider-trading cases, said, &quot;In order for something to be insider trading, you must know that you are receiving inside information,&quot; such as proprietary information about a planned takeover. He said it isn't enough to &quot;receive only the bare bones&quot; of information about other trades that are being made, even if those trades are based on inside information.    The SEC asked the court to require the defendants to account for and to disgorge all profits they made from the alleged insider trading. The agency also asked that they be required to pay civil penalties in the amount of three times the allegedly illegal profits. </TEXT></DOC>
