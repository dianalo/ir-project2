Party Secretary General Ryutaro Hashimoto appeared to have wonthe support of party leaders, though some believed that at age 51he is too young to take the job while the party is in crisis, oneofficial said.   The Liberal Democratic Party officials decided a replacementshould be picked Aug. 8 at a caucus of party lawmakers and approvedin a special session of Parliament about Aug. 10. The party'schoice is expected to win routine approval by Parliament becausethe Liberal Democrats control the more powerful lower house.   However, opposition party officials continued to oppose anyearly session of Parliament. They say they need time to work on abill to abolish an unpopular new 3 percent sales tax.   The tax was a major issue in elections Sunday for half the seatsin the upper house of Parliament. It contributed to the LiberalDemocrats' loss of a majority in the chamber for the first time intheir 34-year history. The party dropped 33 seats, mostly to theleading opposition group, the Japan Socialist Party.   The Liberal Democrats have also struggled with charges that Uno,in office for less than two months, had paid for sex with geishas.   He replaced Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who announced hisresignation April 25 to take responsibility for an influence-buyingscandal that tainted much of the party's top leadership. It tookparty leaders until June 2 to put Uno in office, partly becausethey had trouble finding someone untouched by the scandal.   Uno announced Monday he would resign to take responsibility forSunday's election outcome.   Leaders of the five main factions within the governing partybegan closed-door meetings Thursday to discuss a replacement,despite a pledge Wednesday by Hashimoto that the process would beconducted openly.   Critics have objected to earlier, secret party deliberations topick a prime minister.   Hashimoto is the youngest person to fill the party's No. 2 spot.   Another possible candidate for prime minister is former DeputyPrime Minister Shin Kanemaru.   ``Leaders seem to be trying to build consensus within the partyover Hashimoto, and I have not heard anyone express strongopposition so far,'' said one party official, speaking on conditionof anonymity.   ``But at the same time,'' he added, ``party elders seem to thinkit is premature for the party to give its power to such a youngpolitician in such a turbulent time.''   Hashimoto led the party's effort for Sunday's elections, making90 speeches during the 14-day campaign period. He has said he alsotakes responsibility for Sunday's setback, but he has not saidanything about resigning.   The long-governing conservative party is seeking a new leader tohelp restore public trust before lower house elections, which mustbe held by July 1990.   Meanwhile, Kanemaru said Thursday the Liberal Democrats wouldface a ``terrible outcome'' in the lower house elections if thesales tax remains in effect, news reports said.   The tax, which applies to most purchases, was forced throughParliament by the governing party last year during an oppositionboycott.</TEXT></DOC>
