Infact, each uncertain step the South African government takesseems only to heighten tension.   So who will unite the divided nation? One immediatelythinks of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whose bold opposition toapartheid won him a Nobel Prize. But the Anglican churchesover which he presides remain heavily segregated. Even hisown congregation is nearly all black.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, the grass-roots work is being done by a groupof Christians without international recognition: SouthAfrican charismatics. The idea of charismatics having aserious socio-political impact may sound strange to Americanears. In this country, charismatic and Pentecostal forms ofChristianity have been more associated with emotional worshipand speaking in tongues -- and, more recently, with lavishlife styles and theme parks.   But in South Africa the results of this enthusiastic formof religious experience have been far different. Not thatSouth Africa's charismatics started out to be political.However, in the South African context, just the act ofbuilding large churches where blacks and whites mingleharmoniously is a political statement. And that is exactlywhat the charismatics have done.   Probably the most significant of these integratedcongregations is Ray Macauley's Rhema Church in Johannesburg.Mr. Macauley graduated from Tulsa, Okla.-based evangelistKenneth Hagin's Bible school in 1981 and returned to SouthAfrica to preach an apolitical message of emotional, physicaland financial wholeness for all who would accept God'spromises. The church he founded now has 10,000 members, aboutone-fourth of them black.   Rhema is just one of a dozen charismatic congregationswith integrated memberships of 1,000 or more. The racialbalance varies. More important than the specific proportions,though, is the fact that these large churches and innumerablesmaller ones constitute a substantial social movementconsciously committed to racial equality and intermingling.   Karla Poewe, professor of anthropology at the Universityof Calgary, who (along with her husband, religious studiesprofessor Irving Hexham) has extensively studied SouthAfrican charismatics, found remarkable changes in racialattitudes among members of these churches. Many of them,especially the blacks, were initially attracted by therousing, energetic style of charismatic worship, a definitedeparture from the staid formalism of most South Africanchurches.   For most newcomers, sitting beside a worshiper of anotherrace was a breakthrough. Ms. Poewe found that only four ofthe 150 church members she interviewed retained a reactionarystance on race relations. Most members reported havinginterracial friendships for the first time.   Along with employing both quantitative and qualitativeforms of analysis, Ms. Poewe watched as whites and blacksspontaneously, unhesitatingly chatted after services. &quot;Everyindicator we have,&quot; she concluded, &quot;shows a change in racialattitudes from reactionary to enlightened.&quot;   These churches have done more than integrate theirservices. Two charismatic ministers initiated a &quot;JowetoProject,&quot; its name an amalgam of white Johannesburg and blackSoweto, which in 1984 began taking whites to meetings inblack townships and vice versa. An interracial singing group,Friends First, came together during a period of prayer andfasting in 1985 and has released a record entitled &quot;We See aNew Africa&quot;; Nick Paton, son of renowned author Alan Paton,is one of the singers.   The integrated churches are making a political impact inspite of themselves -- and losing naivete along the way. Twoyears ago they were still thinking they could ignore politicsand just preach the Gospel. Now they are facing pressure notonly from black liberals, who demand radical pronouncementsfrom them, but also from white conservatives for whom thesechurches' visible pattern of racial equality is a quiet butreal threat. Mr. Hexham says the Botha government attemptedto close their integrated day schools, and a South Africanscholar told him the government also sought to discreditthese churches by showing TV programs ridiculing theirfaith-healing practices.   Though reluctant politicians, some of these charismaticsare beginning to think politically, thanks in part to theinfluence of an American import called &quot;Kingdom theology.&quot;Its main proponent, Earl Paulk, pastors an interracial,10,000-member congregation in suburban Atlanta.   Mr. Paulk emphasizes that the church should be sociallyrelevant and unhesitant to challenge ungodly &quot;world systems.&quot;His church's size and activism have made it a recognizable,though nonpartisan force in local politics.   Kingdom theology first entered South Africa four years agowhen a drama written by Mr. Paulk's church was performed at achurch in Durban. Last year Kirby Clements, a black pastor onMr. Paulk's staff, traveled there and addressed 2,000 leadersof the Apostolic Faith Mission, South Africa's largestPentecostal group.   &quot;We confronted the classical Pentecostal theology bysaying you can be politically concerned without beingpoliticized,&quot; says Mr. Clements. The result: morecharismatics, both black and white, quietly determined tolink their faith to peaceful methods of social change.   The spirit motivating these charismatics may be the best,if not the only, path to the elusive goal of racial justicewithout bloodshed in South Africa.   ---   Mr. Barron is a doctoral candidate in religion at theUniversity of Pittsburgh and author of &quot;The Health and WealthGospel&quot; (InterVarsity, Downers Grove, Ill., 1987).</TEXT></DOC>
