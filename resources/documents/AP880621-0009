Gorbachev to pursue domesticreform, saying it could ``reduce mistrust and build confidence.''   The leaders of the seven major industrial democracies alsoendorsed Reagan's call for tougher action to combat terrorism andillegal drug trafficking.   Specifically, they agreed that once a hijacked aircraft haslanded in a country, it should not be allowed to take off again.Moreover, they called for international cooperation ``to trace,freeze and confiscate the proceeds of drug traffickers and to curbmoney laundering'' through legitimate banking institutions.   In a separate statement that cited violence on the Israeli-heldWest Bank, the leaders called for a Mideast peace conference _ astep which Israel opposes.   Reagan and the leaders of Japan, Britain, France, West Germany,Italy and Canada expressed their positions in a politicaldeclaration on their second day of talks. A final economiccommunique is to be issued at the close of their summit on Tuesday.   Posing later with his colleagues for a group picture at theUniversity of Toronto's Hart House, Reagan was asked how he feltabout this being his eighth and final economic summit. ``I'm goingto miss them all,'' he said.   The allies then engaged in a forceful discussion over dinner onthe environment in general and acid rain in particular _ an issuepushed by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   The United States has rejected Canada's demand for scheduledreductions in the smokestack emissions that cause acid rain.   Urging Gorbachev to press ahead with more freedom and opennessin the Soviet Union, the summit leaders promised, ``Each of us willrespond positively to any such developments.''   Holding out the prospect of increased trade with Soviet-blocnations, the summit leaders said, ``We take positive note ofEastern countries' growing interest in ending their economicisolation.''   They also urged Eastern European nations to improve respect forhuman rights, but did not link that issue to an expansion ofEast-West trade.   Officials emphasized a spirit of harmony at the summit andplayed down any differences. ``There was no controversy involvedhere,'' said Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway.   However, French President Francois Mitterrand objected to a U.S.proposal for a task force to seek improved cooperation in thebattle against narcotics. Mitterrand said the seven summit nationsshould not act as a kind of world directorate, with activitiesoutside the scope of their annual meeting, according to hisspokesman, Hubert Vedrine.   Nevertheless, Mitterrand chose not to veto the language because``the fight against drugs is too important for us to block progressfor whatever reason,'' Vedrine said.   Reagan said he was pleased with the communique and felt that thetask force ``can help us win the war against drugs. And we're goingto win.''   Looking ahead to the final communique, Treasury Secretary JamesA. Baker III predicted there would be an agreement on a debt-reliefplan sponsored by France and Britain for sub-Saharan nations, whichhe described as countries that ``have no reasonable prospect ofever getting back on their feet.''   Unlike other nations which have estimated how much debt reliefthey would grant, Baker refused to provide a figure for the UnitedStates.   He cautioned that Latin American countries should not interpretthe action as a sign the United States was relaxing its insistencethat debtor nations adopt free-market reforms in exchange forfurther lending by commercial banks and international lendinginstitutions.   Until recently, the United States had been adamantly opposed todebt relief for any countries, fearing that concessions to thepoorest countries would encourage big debtors such as Mexico toexpect similar relief.   ``We have essentially an agreement,'' Canadian Finance MinisterMichael Wilson said of the proposals to aid the sub-Saharannations. ``All we have to do is work out some words of thetechnical agreement.''   Canadian officials said late Monday that Reagan's call for anend to all farm subsidies by the end of the century was still onthe table.   ``The situation is delicate,'' said one Canadian official whospoke on condition of anonymity. ``The discussions are veryintense. There may be the possibility of movement, and there maynot.''   Baker was asked about reports that the West German central bankwould hike a key interest rate on Tuesday by 0.25 percentage point.Rumors of such a move have sparked fears in financial markets inrecent days that the major industrialized countries were preparinga coordinated round of interest rate hikes as a way of dampeninginflationary pressures.   However, U.S. officials have denied such reports and maintainthat no round of interest rate hikes is likely even if the WestGermans do increase their repurchase rate, which is the rate ofinterest that banks borrow from the West German central bank whenthey use securities for collateral.   Baker said the increase was a small one and was not a matter ofconcern.   On East-West issues, the leaders said nuclear weapons andconventional forces are the best deterrents to war for theforeseeable future.   They hailed the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminateintermediate-range nuclear weapons (INF) and said, ``We now lookfor deep cuts in U.S. and Soviet strategic offensive arms. Wecongratulate President Reagan on what he has already accomplished,along with General Secretary Gorbachev, towards this goal.''   However, Reagan encountered some resistance over the pace ofnegotiations with Moscow for cutbacks in long-range missiles,bombers and submarines.   On East-West ties, the statement said ``in several importantrespects, changes have taken place in relations between Westerncountries and the Soviet Union since we last met.''   It credited Western strength and unity with fostering theevolution.   ``In the Soviet Union, greater freedom and openness will offeropportunities to reduce mistrust and build confidence,'' thestatement said.   Vedrine, the French spokesman, said the language reflected amajor change in tone from earlier summit statements. ``You can seehow far we've come in a few years,'' he said.   Tempering the summit statement, White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater said Reagan, while optimistic about changes in the SovietUnion, was ``pessimistic about certain aspects of (Soviet) defenseposture, the overall adversarial nature of many Soviet policies.''   The leaders also welcomed the beginning of the Soviet withdrawalof troops from Afghanistan, insisting that ``it must be total andapply to the entire country. The Afghan people must be able tochoose their government freely.''   The leaders also said the presence of massive Sovietconventional forces in Eastern Europe and the strength of theWarsaw Pact forces lie at the core of the security problem inEurope.   Despite the picture of harmony displayed by the leaders, therewere some signs of disagreement, noticeably on the issue ofU.S.-Soviet negotiations to cut strategic nuclear arsenals by asmuch as half under a new accord nicknamed START _ Strategic ArmsLimitation Treaty.   Reagan has said he would like to complete an agreement before heleaves office in January but is not sure he can achieve it. WhiteHouse spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``the other countries hereare interested in progress on START, some of them to differentdegrees and with different emphasis.''</TEXT></DOC>
