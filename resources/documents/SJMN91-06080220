Pete Wilson received Monday on various budget optionsweren't designed to choose a path out of the state's budget deficit.;    Theirpurpose was just to lay out the possibilities and the consequences of variousroutes. But they nonetheless highlighted the magnitude of the task.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BUDGET BLUESSO FAR THE ONLY AGREEMENT IN SACRAMENTO ISTHAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     If the state continues on its present course, it will come up $8 billion to$10 billion short in the fiscal year that begins July 1.;    Legislators andthe governor agree that the budget gap is like the drought. It is, in part, ashort-term phenomenon that both underscores the necessity for long-termchanges and provides the crisis atmosphere usually necessary to bring themabout.;    Agreeing that things ought to change, however, is a long way fromagreeing on how they ought to change.;    On that the Capitol will be deeplydivided. Not just because legislators and the governor will be jockeying forpolitical advantage -- though that's part of the reason. But because there isa wide gulf between conservatives and liberals on how much help to give poorand sick people, what level of taxation is fair or prudent, whether schoolsneed reform, and whether too many or too few people are in jail.;    Thosedivisions were apparent as working groups of legislators handed reports toWilson on taxes, school funding, welfare and prisons that had &quot;did not reachconsensus&quot; literally stamped on them.;    Reform will be difficult, if it ispossible at all.;    On the positive side, Wilson and the Legislature don'thave the history of poisoned relations that George Deukmejian and theLegislature had.;    Even with a fresh start, though, the temptation will bestrong, as always, to find the path of least resistance. Talk is alreadycirculating about solving the state's budget problem by transferring programssuch as health care and trial courts to counties.;    Such a proposal shouldbe viewed with skepticism. The state has a history of turning programs over tocounties, then failing to provide counties with the means to support them.When revenues run short, counties face more legal and political obstacles inraising taxes than the state does.;    In the case of trial courts, fundingwas recently transferred to the state, a more sensible arrangement sincecounties have virtually no control over the operation of the courts.;    Mostimportant, turning programs over to counties won't change the fundamentalcause of the state's budget gap. Demand for programs -- more sick people, moreprisoners -- is outpacing the revenues that fund them. The difference will beas crippling for counties as for the state.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910320  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  431  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 20, 199100080220,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
