But at Kentucky Highlands Investment Corp., new-venture money flows uphill -- into the poverty-ridden villages and backwoods shacks of the Appalachian Mountains.    The private, nonprofit venture fund's mission is to recharge southeastern Kentucky's moribund economy. While other venture capitalists seek out glamour industries, Kentucky Highlands backs hograisers, tent manufacturers and makers of plastic lids -- all of them in a pocket of Appalachia that has been deeply depressed for more than a century.    &quot;We don't get to look at that many slick deals, all packaged and ready to move,&quot; says Jerry Rickett, Kentucky Highlands' president.    In 21 years of fostering job growth in Appalachia, Kentucky Highlands has learned much about the importance of entrepreneurship in rural America. The concern started in 1968 as part of a Great Society job-creation program, but it has since weaned itself from federal support and evolved into a rare hybrid: a private venture-capital fund motivated not by profit, but by its economic-development mission.    The concern maintains a rare mix of altruism and hard-nosed capitalism. Its goal is economic development, but it seeks out &quot;those in the community who have the skills and toughness to succeed in the marketplace,&quot; according to David Osborne, author of a recent book on state economic development strategies.    A lean operation with six employees, a handful of consultants and a mere $13 million in capital, it has toted up a record that might make an orthodox venture capitalist blush. Eleven of the 19 new ventures it has financed have survived, most for three years or more. Five of the eleven survivors are successful to varying degrees; six are just muddling along. Another five ventures have flopped. (Three are still starting up.) But few economic-development programs can match Kentucky Highlands' track record. Over the years, it has created 1,800 jobs generating more than $80 million in income for people in southeastern Kentucky. It continues to create jobs at a rate of 200 a year, and has expanded its activities to recruiting branch manufacturing plants, developing industrial real estate and providing working capital for existing businesses.    It also has lured to its region a handful of entrepreneurs who have started successful new ventures and stayed. &quot;The shortest resource {in depressed rural areas} isn't a lack of market opportunities,&quot; says Tom Miller, director of program-related investments for the Ford Foundation and a former president of Kentucky Highlands. &quot;It's not a lack of labor that can do the job. It's not a lack of capital. It's a lack of the person that can stand in the middle of all that and deliver ideas that can succeed.&quot;    A handful of entrepreneurs recruited by Kentucky Highlands has had a remarkable impact on a region steeped in generations of joblessness.    Ever since Steven Meng responded in the mid-1970s to a Kentucky Highlands advertisement for staff members, the University of Kentucky business graduate has been starting, saving or shutting down businesses. He shut down an audio-equipment maker Kentucky Highlands had backed and liquidated a stuffed-toy company it had started.    Then he helped start a women's clothing manufacturer, save a plastics manufacturer and a woodcrafts concern, and start a retail fixtures maker. (He has since left Kentucky Highlands' staff to run the woodcrafts and retail-fixtures concerns, in which he purchased a stake.)    All told, the businesses Mr. Meng has started or saved employ more than 500 workers, providing the only regular paychecks most of them have ever had. In some areas, his ventures account for almost all significant economic activity.    By sticking with its entrepreneurial recruits through tough times, Kentucky Highlands has enabled some to found successful new companies where they might otherwise have foundered. James C. Egnew, an aeronautical engineer from Nashville, Tenn., was lured by Kentucky Highlands' offer of financing to tiny Sterns, Ky., in the early 1970s to found a family-tent company that was successful for several years.    But when a flood of imports slashed prices in the family-tent market, his firm, Outdoor Venture Corp., nearly went under. He was taking heavy losses on his inventory, but Kentucky Highlands provided added capital and helped persuade other lenders to stick with Outdoor Venture.    Soon, Mr. Egnew hit on another winner -- a military-tent business -- and eventually started making air bags for autos too. Today, the two operations have sales of about $15 million, employ 200 people and support full- or part-time employment for an additional 100, including two job programs for the handicapped.    Kentucky Highlands has also found that it sometimes pays to back entrepreneurs who have been given a cold shoulder elsewhere. When Jack O. Touratsos, an industrial engineer, sought startup financing for a plastics-molding plant, &quot;I didn't have any money&quot; to attract venture capital, he says. &quot;We were like a guy who goes into a singles bar with a wedding ring. We were in a mundane industry. We didn't have racehorses or computer technology. We just didn't have the pizazz.&quot;    The company, based in Mt. Vernon, Ky., now is a thriving manufacturer that has generated 400 jobs, spun off three new machine shops and helped multiply the size of several truckers and other suppliers many times over. Mr. Touratsos sold the firm, generating a profit of more than $3 million for Kentucky Highlands.    Kentucky Highlands also found that skilled management assistance to startups is even more crucial in depressed rural areas, where entrepreneurs are struggling against heavy odds. After Kentucky Highlands lost $275,000 on a failed steel fabricating firm because the founder was underpricing his products, a member of the fund's board suggested that the fund should intervene more deeply in management. &quot;If it's our baby,&quot; he said, &quot;we'd better rock it.&quot;    As a result, staffers now provide months of intensive help to some new ventures, long after other funds would have written them off. Thomas Musbach, a former Cincinnati marketing and finance consultant recruited by Kentucky Highlands, worked as a staffer for a little less than a year before leaving to manage the turnaround of a troubled computer-peripherals maker in depressed Campton, Ky., saving 195 jobs in the process. Mr. Touratsos' company almost went under in its third year; Mr. Meng jumped in as temporary chairman and persuaded suppliers to give the company a little more time.    At the woodcrafts concern in McKee, Ky., a hamlet of 500, Mr. Meng labors in a drab cement-block office on a gravel lot dredged from the side of a mountain. Within a few miles, backwoods roads wander past dirt-floored shacks where families live in abject poverty.    &quot;You get a bonus in seeing the effects your company is having on people,&quot; he says. Many employees find better housing or buy a car for the first time, he says.    Mr. Musbach found the same incentive to stay. He discovered in himself &quot;a sense of altruism -- a sense that the people in this area deserve something better,&quot; he says.    Perhaps most important, Kentucky Highlands has found that &quot;economic development probably is a 50-year problem in a rural community,&quot; Mr. Miller says. &quot;Whether we're reigniting the entrepreneurial engines remains to be seen.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
