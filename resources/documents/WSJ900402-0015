Stertz   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/02/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><CO>   F C</CO><IN>AUTOMOBILES (AUT)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)</IN><LP>   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. is asking its top100 executives to own stock equal to a certain percentage oftheir salaries in an unusual program to focus their attentionon the auto maker's long-term future.   The program, promoted by Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, is thelatest such measure aimed at giving Chrysler officials adirect financial interest in the company's fate above andbeyond the usual executive stock options.</LP><TEXT>   Already, most of the auto maker's top 2,000 officials havegambled as much as 10% of their base pay on the company'sability to cut $1 billion from its costs by Dec. 31. If thecost-cutting drive succeeds, the officials will profithandsomely. But they lose their money if the goal isn't met.   &quot;We are trying a number of unique methods to get topmanagement to share the risks or rewards of the next fewyears,&quot; said company spokesman Steven Harris of the newstock-ownership program.   In composite trading Friday on the New York StockExchange, Chrysler common closed at $16.625, off 25 cents, onvolume of 642,200 shares. In the past 52 weeks, the stocktraded at a low of $15.875 and a high of $27.125.   Separately, Ford Motor Co. reinstated merit-pay raises forits 55,000 salaried employees effective yesterday. Ford hadsuspended merit-pay increases in January because of saggingfinancial results, but said then that it would considerreinstating such raises at the end of the first quarter.   In a letter to employees in the U.S. and Canada, Fordexecutives said the company believes the sales downturn hasbottomed out and that the worst is behind Ford. TheNo.2-ranked auto maker cautioned employees that manyuncertainties remain this year.   Still, Ford's guarded optimism contrasts with theausterity mode at Chrysler, which alone among the Big Threeauto makers didn't pay executive bonuses this year.   The Chrysler stock-ownership goal for executives, whichbegan recently, isn't mandatory. But it does provide eachexecutive with guidelines on the amount of Chrysler stockthat he or she should own to have a &quot;fair share&quot; of thecompany.   The guidelines are based on a formula tied to theexecutive's pay and seniority with the No. 3-ranked U.S. automaker. Shares the executives already control through stockoptions, recent purchases and so-called 401K savings planscount in the program. Chrysler declined to provide furtherdetails.   It's unclear how many U.S. companies have similarstock-ownership targets, but such goals don't exist at Fordor at No. 1-ranked General Motors Corp. Three years ago, GMdid change its management bonus payments to stock from cash.But because the stock can be sold, that doesn't amount to aspecific stock-ownership goal for executives.</TEXT></DOC>
