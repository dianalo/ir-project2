Simonds, an 18-year IBMexecutive who joined the company as president and chief executive officerafter a decade as Amdahl Corp.'s executive vice president.andP;  &quot;Databases aregrowing much faster than we had anticipated,&quot; he says.andP;  Regarding growth,Teradata's installed base of 260 systems and 120 customers compares favorablywith just 168 installations and 87 customers a year ago.andM;Serving Up DatabasesandM;Essentially, the DBC functions as a database server, usually attached tomainframes.andP;  Applications from the host communicate with the DBC in theStructured Query Language (SQL) through gateways from a customer informationand control system (CICS), IBM's Information Management System (IMS),Transaction Processing Facility (TPF) and other subsystems.andM;An entry-level system, priced at $400,000, uses six parallel processormodules based on Intel 80286 and 80386 microprocessors.andP;  Each module containssoftware as well as hardware such as memory, cache, power supplies and otherelectronics.andP;  Customers can upgrade incrementally by adding horsepower at$60,000 per processor module.andP;  Because of this upgrade potential, a top ofthe line Teradata database machine can provide as many as 300 to 400processors at a price between $25 million and $30 million.andP;  The typical costis about $1.5 million, and the company's largest installed configuration is$14 million.andM;By the end of the year, Teradata will deliver systems based on Intel 80486chips.andP;  This will increase the per-processor performance to between 8 millionand 10 million instructions per second, up from the 3MIPS rate of a typical386-based system.andP;  The final performance of individual DBC systems asmeasured in MIPS is directly dependent on the number of processors installed.andM;Many Hands Make Lighter WorkandM;The DBC is the brainchild of Jack Shemer, now vice chairman of the company.andO;Shemer first conceived of a database machine in the late 1960s when hedesigned computers at Scientific Data Systems, which was acquired by XeroxCorp. in 1969.andP;  The idea was based on the concept of distributing functionsamong processing elements, each of which would have a specific set offunctions to process tasks in parallel.andP;  The idea grew as Shemer worked laterat Transaction Technology Inc., a subsidiary of New York City-based Citicorp,which became Teradata's first big customer.andM;Shemer reasoned that because mainframes, in effect, work on one task at atime, managing huge relational databases would be more cost effective with anarray of mulitple processors, with each dedicated to a specific function.andO;The technical challenge was to devise an architecture in which large numbersof microprocessor-based modules could cooperate on a database problem withoutthe interconnection and intercommunication functions becoming overwhelming.andO;The answer was a network structure that Shemer and his design team called&quot;Ynet,&quot; because it was composed of inverted Ys.andM;Requests for data originating on a mainframe or workstation would betranslated by an interface processor into internal commands and be forwardedover the Ynet to access module processors (AMPs), each managing a diskstorage unit (DSU).andP;  The AMPs would retrieve the requested records from theDSUs and place them on the Ynet, which would then merge them into the orderrequested by the user.andM;Ahead of the team, however, loomed a massive software development project tomake the system fault tolerant for mission-critical applications, to buildinterfaces to mainframes and workstations and to program five major operatingenvironments into the system.andP;  Today's Teradata Operating System (TOS) runs acommunications processor, an interface processor and the AMP.andP;  TOS must alsocontrol the relational software, which performs two functions.andP;  One is toaccept the query, parse it and distribute it over all of the processors.andP;  Itsother function is to find and join information from a relational database.andM;According to Simonds, Teradata now has more than three million lines of codein its relational system and in the operating system that manages theparallel architecture.andP;  He says hardware development was only about 20 to 30%of the development expenses, with the remainder going into an intense,five-year development effort in software.andP;  Although the company was formed in1979, it shipped nothing until 1984.andM;Unlike competing products at the time, which were essentially databasemanagement system (DBMS) accelerators, Teradata's architecture is a back-endsystem designed specifically to manage data.andP;  &quot;We weren't looking just tounload the software to a more efficient engine or trying to provide the hostwith more cycles; we were trying to build a database processing system,&quot;explains Jerold Modes, a founder and senior vice president of Teradata.andM;The key to the DBC 1012's success, says Simonds, is its interface to the&quot;outside world.&quot;andP;  Users, whether they're working at mainframe terminals orworkstations, enter SQL queries into the system and get SQL answers back.andO;The searching and sorting is done inside the system, which explains why theDBC qualifies as a computer and not just a DBMS, says Simonds.andP;  Queriesprocessed serially on mainframe databases bring back extraneous information,whereas queries processed on the DBC are searched simultaneously.andP;  Only theanswers are returned to the user.andM;Worldly ConnectionsandM;Last year, Baxter Healthcare Corp. of Deerfield, Ill., acquired afour-processor DBC 1012 with 2GB of storage.andP;  It chose the DBC because thesystem could accommodate a workstation running the Metaphor object-orienedoperating environment, a product of Mountain View, Calif.-based MetaphorComputer Systems Inc. Baxter had examined Digital Equipment Corp.'s VAXsystems, along with IBM products including the AS/400.andP;  &quot;Teradata offered usa special advantage in that we didn't require a large, sophisticated staff todo the programming on the Teradata,&quot; says Sue McCormack, manager ofinformation management with Baxter's Pharmacy Division.andP;  &quot;Whereas before wehad a staff of eight people programming a database machine offering [fromShareBase Corp.] for our marketing users, we were able to cut that down totwo persons.&quot;andM;The divisionhs marketing and financial staffs run decision support programsagainst the large database of sales, customer history and market researchdata.andM;Competing with DB2andM;Although DBC coexists with both IBM's IMS and DB2 database managementofferings--some 80% of Teradata's customers also use DB2--it is beginning toperform end runs around DB2.andP;  This is especially true where users access verylarge databases with complex queries that tie up resources.andP;  One customer,British Airways, is moving its complex inquiry systems from DB2 to Teradata'sDBC after experiencing annoying downtime on its mainframes.andP;  Peter Blundell,the airline's database development manager, says the move will enable users&quot;to perform on-line analysis of the masses of valuable airline trafficinformation [without downtime].&quot;andM;Teradata's strategists think much of its acceptance will stem fromorganizations that have massive relational databases--on the order of 5 to10GB--and that need parallel processing to manage their on-line applications.andO;One such application, decision support, is already used by 80% of Teradata'scustomers.andM;So far, comparable performance can't be found on mainframes alone.andP;  As thevolume of end-user queries increases, mainframes begin to lose their costeffectiveness.andP;  A single database query can consume as little as five secondsto as much as five hours, depending on how well it is structured and the dataaccess managed (see &quot;Tracking the Wild Database,&quot; July 1, 1989, p. 37).andP;  &quot;DB2is a resource hog on a mainframe,&quot; declares Ron Fox, Baxter Pharmacy'smanager of technical operations.andM;Earlier this year, Teradata unveiled its open systems strategy, whichincludes plans for a remote database server product called the DB 1010.andO;According to Teradata, the product will be capable of serving multipleclients while acting as a client itself to the central DBC 1012.andP;  The companywill also offer the UNIX operating system on the DBC by adding to its Ynetarchitecture special applications-processing hardware that transforms the DBCinto a general UNIX server.andP;  Both of these efforts are part of an alliancewith Charles River Data Systems of Framingham, Mass.andP;  Teradata is basing itsapplications processor on one made by Charles River, which runs the UNOSversion of UNIX.andM;In April of this year, Teradata acquired ShareBase Corp., a Los Gatos,Calif., supplier of database software and hardware, for $5.5 million instock.andP;  ShareBase, formerly Britton-Lee, provides Teradata with a strongentry into the client/server market and access to a 100-customer user base of800 systems, many of which are readly to be migrated to larger systems suchas the DBC.andM;This spring the company also acquired an optical storage system through ajoint venture with FileTek Inc., a Rockville, Md., developer of mass storagesystems.andP;  The alliance will provide DBC customers with on-line access toarchival data usually stored on tape or microfiche.andP;  Simonds says SQL queriescan be made to either data storage location, although response times willnaturally be slower than with magnetic media.andP;  To speed retrieval times,customers may opt to download data stored optically to the DBC during certainstrategic periods in the business year, such as before the Christmas period.andM;Teradata's most ambitious alliance to date was sealed this spring, when NCRCorp. paid nearly $37 million for 1.5 million Teradata shares.andP;  The twocompanies began joint development of a massively parallel supercomputerrunning UNIX.andP;  NCR will focus on computer development under the direction ofNCR's chief scientist Philip M. Neches, a Teradata founder.andP;  Teradata willfocus on database computing.andM;The initial concept involves using multiple Intel 80486 chips in eachprocessing module under a combined reduced instruction set computer (RISC)and complex instruction set computer (CISC) architecture.andP;  Up to 1,000processor modules, with two to four microprocessors apieces, will be tiedtogether in a parallel fashion.andP;  As needs require, even more powerfulmicroprocessors can be incorporated into the design.andM;Simonds says most large Teradata customers are candidates for systems of thissize.andP;  &quot;It really translates into the next step in the evolution ofTeradata,&quot; he adds.andM;The Market PlayersandM;Until now, Teradata has had the database machine market virtually to itself,although Tandem Computers Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., has a smaller scaleoffering, as do some of the super-minicomputer makers such as Convex ComputerCorp. of Richardson, Texas, and Sequent Computer Systems Inc. of Beaverton,Ore.andP;  Database software companies such as Belmont, Calif.-based Oracle Corp.andO;are seeking alliances with manufacturers of parallel computers.andP;  And a numberof U.S.andP;  and Japanese computer companies have research and developmentprojects under way.andP;  Simonds expects an eventual announcement from IBM, eventhough DB2 consumes &quot;a lot of MIPS on the mainframe.andP;  And mainframes arestill by far the most profitable of IBM's markets.&quot;andM;Analysts agree with Simonds that Teradata has a substantial lead overcompeting entries.andP;  A recent report by the Gartner Group Inc., a Stamford,Conn., market research organization says that Tandem could become aformidable opponent with its NonStop SQL DBMS for on-line transactionprocessing (OLTP)-intensive environments.andP;  (Teradata is basing its OLTPcapabilities on a soon-to-be implemented UNIX capability.)andP;  The Gartnerreport adds, however, that it will be at least three years before acomparable high-end platform emerges to challenge the company.andP;  A likelycompetitor could be Oracle, which has a massively parallel product calledNCube2 using an interconnect architecture similar to Teradata's Ynet.andM;Other observers believe the database machine concept is destined for ashort--but profitable--life.andP;  &quot;If today's general purpose database softwareimproves dramatically, the mainframe could be a viable engine for managing[massive] databases,&quot; says Fred Ledbetter, director of information systemstechnology at U.S.andP;  West Communications Inc., in Denver, which usesTeradata's DBC 1012.andP;  Ledbetter thinks such improved software couldeventually transform mainframes into &quot;gigantic high-performance fileservers.&quot;andO;He adds, that Teradata's DBCs will always retain some marketing niche due tobetter price/performance.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
