Those are the values we have come tocovet as important.   ``The philosophy of using genetic engineering is to improve aspecies. So what criteria do we use to determine what arefunctional genes? Who should have that authority? Would you trustthe president? The Congress? The National Academy of Science? Wouldyou trust GE or the marketplace?   ``Two value systems are in confrontation: the ancient value ofour sacred relationship to the rest of creation and our desire toreduce everything to utilitarian standards.''   These would be tough times for scientists even without JeremyRifkin.   Long accustomed to working in good faith, researchersincreasingly find themselves assailed by creationists, animalrights activists and others.   Close scrutiny by one's colleagues is one thing; surveillance bya suspicious, scientifically unschooled public is something else.   A biotechnology symposium at the University of California lastfall gave a glimpse of scientists' mounting frustrations at findingtheir experiments hamstrung by what they called ``biologicalMcCarthyism'' or ``the `tomato-that-ate-Hollywood' syndrome.''   The symposium came in the wake of field tests of ``ice-minus''bacteria by researchers from the University of California atBerkeley and Advanced Genetic Sciences. The test involved therelease of genetically altered microbes. Placed on crops, themicrobes help prevent frost from forming.   Scientists generally agreed that testing the microbes onstrawberry and potato plants presented no danger. Rifkin and othersfeared the microbes could mutate to cause human disease. Lawsuitsand protests followed. Ultimately, vandals tore up plants at bothtest sites.   ``Everybody involved with ice-minus has had such a horrendoustime with the controversy that they're all burned out,'' onescientist said.   Some scientists who have reservations about aspects ofbiotechnology feel that to say so would be counterproductive.   ``There aren't many societies that give science the free reinit's had here,'' biologist Newman says. ``It's a precious thing,and it relies on good will. Scientists are very reluctant to sourthat.''   Genetic engineering technology involves manipulating the DNA,the basic substance of heredity of living organisms. By moving DNAbetween different organisms, researchers hope to develop moreproductive plants and treat genetic diseases. They also hope tocreate new drugs, one application of genetics that Rifkin does notoppose.   Newman is among a handful of experts who are beginning toexpress scientific as well as ethical doubts about geneticengineering. He believes the strong drive to commercialize newtechniques of manipulating genetic material has given rise todistorted views about biotechnology's potential.   ``The standard view holds that biologists have `cracked the codeof life' and are now poised to `genetically reprogram' damaged orunsuitable life forms,'' he wrote in a recent issue of Perspectivesin Biology and Medicine.   ``But the most that can be claimed for DNA on the basis ofpresent knowledge is that it specifies some of the ingredients thatmake up an organism's cells. DNA does not function as a `commandcenter' or `blueprint' for the functioning of those cells, as hassometimes been stated...   ``The concept nonetheless continues to flourish in textbooks, inthe popular media, and in corporate handouts, as a confidently wornmask that obscures the primitive state of our understanding of thebiological world.''   The notion of ``genetic programming,'' intended as metaphor, isnow taken literally, Newman says, resulting in seriousmisconceptions of the status and potential of biotechnology on thepart of scientists and non-scientists alike.   ``Since each gene contributes to thousands of traits, and eachtrait is the result of the interaction of thousands of genes, allwe can do is make minor modifications and hope for the best.''   Separating good genes from bad is far more complicated than mostpeople realize, he adds. The same recessive gene linked todevelopment of one disease _ sickle cell anemia, for example _ alsoprotects against another _ malaria.   Clearly, ``the nature of this material is very different fromwhat we're used to working with in building and engineering,'' saysNewman. He characterizes current knowledge of the relationshipbetween an organism's DNA and its overt characteristics as``meager.''   To Rifkin, biotechnology is unfolding in a manner all tooreminiscent of other technical and scientific developments thathave suddenly come to exact an unexpected price. He points to amagazine cover story about the greenhouse effect, the gradualheating of the planet scientists say will result from thedestruction of the ozone layer in the atmosphere that protectsagainst the sun's ultraviolet rays.   ``This is the bill for the industrial age,'' he says,brandishing the magazine. ``It lasted 200 years and we'll pay forit for 2,000.   ``Now we're about to run out of fossil fuels and enter the ageof renewable resources. This is the time to raise the issues _ likepatenting animals. It's as if, 100 years ago, we divided up the oiland coal, the resources for the industrial age. Now we're dividingup the resources for the age of biotechnology.   ``Science and technology initiatives dramatically affect thefuture. We can't be passive. The 21st century is being defined now.We're determined to help shape it before it becomes a faitaccompli.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 28</NOTE></DOC>
