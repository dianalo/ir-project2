In Portland, Ore., amanagement consultant has been telling frustrated supervisorsthat productivity is bound to suffer for now. And inSavannah, Ga., a psychologist has begun treating patients whoseem to have become addicted to watching news developments,forgoing sleep and conversation with family members, in caseshe diagnoses as &quot;CNN Complex.&quot;   In Washington yesterday, First Lady Barbara Bush urgedparents to monitor what their children watch and be preparedto explain events so children don't get &quot;terriblenightmares.&quot;   &quot;Many people are getting preoccupied with the coverage tothe point where they're afraid to miss anything,&quot; says RobertButterworth, a psychologist in Los Angeles. &quot;Their livesrevolve around televised coverage. But you have to make aplan to go on with life.&quot;   Many people, though, won't abandon the electronicumbilical cord. A TV-band radio on her desk at the ChildGuidance Clinic in Dallas keeps Tricia Medrano, a 43-year-oldmother of three draft-age boys, up to speed on the latestfrom the Middle East. Her car radio is set to an all-newsstation for the drive home, and when she gets there she flipson the television, never missing a beat of coverage. &quot;I'mlistening every waking moment,&quot; she says. &quot;I probably monitorit too much.&quot;   Reactions to the war and its coverage, of course, aren'tuniform. The fairly sanitized pictures of the fighting so farmay be desensitizing some Americans to the crisis, somesociologists say. With few images of the horrors of battle,&quot;it becomes easy to see the war simply as a giant Nintendogame on the TV screen,&quot; says Richard Peterson, a VanderbiltUniversity sociologist who has studied media and culture.   Mr. Peterson and others suggest that some people may evenbe perceiving the war as a sporting event. That wasparticularly plausible over the weekend, Mr. Peterson says,when the battle news was sandwiched into the NationalFootball League playoffs, with their descriptions of the airgame and the ground game, and news broadcasts were full ofreports about how many Iraqi missiles had been shot down.&quot;The whole thing became sort of a Patriots, 9, Scuds, 0,&quot; hesays.   For some individuals, TV coverage may even have apositive, cathartic effect. If one can't be there to help thesoldiers, the theory goes, just committing personal time tothe coverage can help put one at ease. By watching eventsunfold on TV, says Salomon Grimberg, a psychiatrist inDallas, &quot;the American public is being made an activeparticipant, like a cheering squad.&quot;   That participation is made possible by advances intechnology. During the Vietnam War, correspondents oftenfilmed an event in the field, flew back to Saigon and shippedthe footage to studios in New York. Once there, the filmstill had to be processed before it could be shown on theevening news. Today in the Middle East, portable satellitedishes and hand-held mini-cams provide instantaneoustransmission of bombings and other events as they play out.Says Reuven Frank, a retired NBC News president who oversawthe network's Vietnam coverage, &quot;The technology has moved byan entire civilization since then.&quot;   Some media specialists think the coverage plays perfectlyinto Americans' desire for instant gratification. SaysEverette Dennis, executive director of the Gannett FoundationMedia Center at Columbia University, &quot;People get a warm andfuzzy feeling that, `Gosh, I can go out for three hours, comehome, switch on CNN and know exactly where things stand.'&quot;   But the rush among competing networks to deliver, say,news of the latest Scud launching can mean that accuracysuffers. That, in turn, can send viewers on an emotionalroller coaster, psychologists say. Shortly after reports thatIraq had apparently landed a chemical warhead in Israel, theswitchboard lit up at Channel 8's &quot;Desert Storm Hotline&quot; inDallas. Frightened viewers wanted to know where to buy gasmasks, the location of local bomb shelters, and whether thechemicals would eventually descend on Dallas.   &quot;The whole mind may rationalize that nothing is going on,&quot;says Mr. Peterson, the Vanderbilt sociologist. &quot;But your bodyreacts to all the reports that you're hearing.&quot;   Mental-health professionals are just beginning to assessthe impact of the TV coverage. Since the U.S. invasion began,the Seattle office of Employee Support Systems Co., whichoffers assistance programs to companies, has been gettingcalls from Vietnam veterans who have had flashbacks oftraumatic combat experiences. More surprising, some callerswho have no family or friends serving in the Gulf havereported stress-related problems.   James Turner, a psychologist at Memorial Medical Center inSavannah, Ga., has begun treating two families whose membersbecame withdrawn and isolated from one another because theywere mesmerized by watching war developments all night on TV.The families, neither with military ties, have the &quot;CNNComplex,&quot; he says. He has suggested a program of &quot;plannedwithdrawal,&quot; with regulated schedules for viewing, includingwatching only news summaries rather than breaking events, anda return to normal routine.   He and other psychologists wonder whether some people aregetting hooked by a voyeuristic thrill similar to theexperience of watching a horror movie. The difference forthose following events in the Gulf is that their attachmentto the coverage is disrupting their live -s -keeping them uplate at night and even making them feel guilty when somethinghappens and they aren't watching. &quot;There is a vicarious senseof being there: The air raid sirens go off in Riyadh, andyou're waiting along with the reporter to see what's going tohappen,&quot; says Mr. Turner. &quot;We don't know how serious this is.The hope is eventually it will wear out.&quot;   Clearly, though, the immediacy of the coverage-breakinginto regular programming and pre-empting Saturday morningcartoons -- has thrust a war in front of the nation'schildren as never before. Jeff St. Romain, who works for anemployee assistance program in Salt Lake City, Utah., sayshis 10-year-old son couldn't sleep Monday night because heworried that the Iraqis were hurting the captured U.S. airmenshown on TV earlier in the day.   With mental-health experts concerned about even moreemotional fallout for children -- including fear, anger,sadness, anxiety and feelings of helplessness --psychologists and childhood specialists are split on how muchcoverage children should be allowed to watch. Most agree,though, that discussing whatever is seen is essential.   Family Communications Inc., the Pittsburgh-based companyof TV personality Fred Rogers, has been inundated with callsfrom teachers' groups and day-care centers. Anticipating theneed, Mr. Rogers flipped off his television when news of theBaghdad bombings broke last week and spent four hoursdrafting a position paper for those groups.   Mr. Rogers has also produced several public serviceannouncements on coping with the war for children andparents. &quot;The world isn't giving us any continuity,&quot; he says,&quot;so we must at least establish it in our own homes.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
