The reduction in earnings is a result of a $100 million reserve being set up for Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., the new entertainment giant that will emerge from the combination. The reserve, which will appear on Columbia's balance sheet, will cover restructuring moves such as laying off employees and writing down canceled movie and television projects.    The reserve and its impact on Coca-Cola's earnings were contained in proxy materials filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. Analysts had been predicting that Coca-Cola would take a hit on the proposed transaction, but the exact details haven't previously been disclosed.    Last year, Coca-Cola had net income for the quarter of $314.5 million, or 82 cents a share, after a $375 million gain on the initial public offering of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. and a $180 million restructuring charge.    Under the terms of the proposed transaction, which will be put to a vote of Tri-Star shareholders Dec. 15., Coca-Cola will initially own about 80% of the new company, then reduce that stake to 49% by distributing shares of Columbia Pictures Entertainment to its shareholders.    Coke said in the filing that it has no present intention of disposing of any of its 49% stake, but noted that it is &quot;not contractually prohibited from doing so&quot; and is entitled to sell shares in the open market.    In the proxy materials, filed in connection with the Tri-Star holders' meeting, Coca-Cola said it will record a pretax provision of $100 million for the quarter to cover restructuring costs associated with the transaction. However, Coca-Cola said, the net effect of the provision will be reduced to $12 million as a result of adjustments made to income-tax reserves and reserves that had been previously taken for insurance, pension and other expenses.    &quot;We were over-reserved,&quot; said a Coca-Cola spokeswoman. &quot;We'd accounted for more taxes than the entertainment business was likely to pay.&quot;    One analyst familiar with the terms of the transaction said that providing the reserve on Columbia's balance sheet &quot;is good because it clears the decks of a lot of hits the new company would otherwise have had to run through their (profit and loss) statement.&quot; This analyst added that Coca-Cola probably could have taken a larger reserve, &quot;but Coke can only tolerate a certain amount of hits&quot; to its own net income.    The proxy materials say Tri-Star has lined up a $1.5 billion credit agreement with a group of banks and indicate that Coca-Cola has taken some other steps to strengthen the new company. Coca-Cola has agreed that, subject to board approval, one of its units will buy 100,000 shares of a new adjustable rate preferred stock in Tri-Star for $100 million.    Coca-Cola said the preferred is designed &quot;to provide another source of equity for Tri-Star and to provide Coca-Cola with a competitive rate of return on that money.&quot; Coca-Cola also has eased the new company's debt burden. The debt that will be transferred from Coca-Cola's books to those of the new concern will be about $295 million, instead of the $400 million expected initially.    But despite the sweeter terms, the transaction is considered especially advantageous for Coca-Cola. In addition to shedding the debt, Coca-Cola is also reducing its risk in entertainment during a year in which the business has performed poorly.    The proxy materials show that Columbia Pictures Entertainment will have lower revenue and considerably lower earnings on a pro forma basis for 1987 against 1986, primarily as a result of the poor box office record of the original Columbia Pictures, which Coca-Cola acquired in 1982. According to the materials, the pro forma net income for 1986 was $85.1 million on revenue of $1.7 billion. For the first nine months of this year, revenue was $1.06 billion, and net income was only $23 million.    One beneficiary of the transaction is Allen andamp; Co., an investment firm that received a $5 million fee for negotiating the pact for Tri-Star and for rendering a fairness opinion. Herbert A. Allen Jr., chief executive officer, is a director of Coca-Cola and will be a director of Columbia. Mr. Allen, 47 years old, was chairman of the original Columbia prior to Coca-Cola's acquisition.    Coca-Cola, with its 49% stake in the new entity, will still wield considerable influence on Columbia; Coca-Cola President Donald Keough will be chairman of Columbia, and five Coca-Cola directors and one executive who isn't a director will be on its 13-member board. Victor Kaufman, Tri-Star's chairman, will be chief executive of the new entity, but will run Tri-Star and Columbia as separate studios.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Coca-Cola shares closed at $39, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
