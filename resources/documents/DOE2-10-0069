The seabed platform has been used toprobe both entry pathways and undisturbed sediments. Piezocone penetrationand dissipation tests have measured no changes in sediment property dueto disturbance caused by the penetrators. The seabed platform has beenused also for coring. Analyses of cores taken in undisturbed sedimentsand over the entry points of penetrators have found evidence that surfacesediments have been drawn downwards, but no indication that the propertiesof the disturbed sediments have been significantly affected except, inone case, in the uppermost metre of core some softening was measured.Sediments at the Antibes site differ from those of the deep ocean byprocessing greater stiffness and greater insensitivity to remoulding.</TEXT></DOC>
