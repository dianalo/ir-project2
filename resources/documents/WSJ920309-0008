Instead, U.S. officials suspect that the Iraqi envoy,Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, is coming more to argue foran end to economic sanctions against Iraq than to retreat onBaghdad's refusal to cooperate with a recent U.N. team thatsought to destroy military machinery. As a result, there islikely to be a round of angry bickering and denunciationsthis week, followed by efforts to exert new pressure on Iraqto force it to cooperate more fully with the U.N.</LP><TEXT>   The most likely outcome, according to diplomats from someSecurity Council nations, will be an attempt to impose neweconomic constraints on Baghdad by freezing more of itsassets. But U.S. and British officials pointedly refuse torule out military strikes.   Officials won't discuss military options, but the U.S. hasenough aircraft at bases and on aircraft carriers in the areato easily conduct a strike against selected weaponsinstallations if President Bush wants to vividly demonstratehis seriousness.   &quot;One way or the other, there will be compliance&quot; with U.N.resolutions, declared one senior U.S. policy maker.   In fact, public discussion of the military option haspicked up in the past few days. Just yesterday, British PrimeMinister John Major said in a British Broadcasting Corp.interview that he would support military action if the U.N.approved it. And a group of U.S. lawmakers has sent PresidentBush a letter urging him to announce that military force willbe used if necessary to enforce the terms of U.N. resolutionsthat ended last year's war to drive Iraqi troops from Kuwait.   Mr. Aziz, the Iraqi envoy, is expected to arrive in NewYork today and address the Security Council later in theweek. He is expected to argue that Iraq is complying withU.N. resolutions as it interprets them and press the case forlifting economic sanctions imposed more than a year ago, atthe conclusion of the Gulf War.   The immediate purpose of Mr. Aziz's visit is to explainIraq's refusal to cooperate with a team of U.N. specialiststhat left Iraq more than a week ago after the Baghdadgovernment blocked it from destroying equipment used toenhance the performance of Iraq's Scud missiles. Iraq arguedthat the machines could be converted to civilian use andtherefore weren't subject to destruction under U.N.resolutions calling for elimination of weapons of massdestruction.   Behind that argument lies a far broader issue, however.Iraq appears to have decided it is time to signal that itwon't cooperate further with intrusive U.N. missions todismantle its weapons programs until it gets some reward inthe form of an easing of international economic sanctions.Iraq is still under an international trade embargo for mostgoods except food and medicine. And Baghdad hasn't been ableto sell any of its oil since the war's end, because it hasrefused to accept terms under which the U.N. would controlthe proceeds to ensure that they went to purchase only foodand medicine or to pay war reparations.   Some U.N. diplomats think Mr. Aziz may come with a modestconcession to try to entice the world body to accept Iraq'spleas for relief. But the diplomats also indicate they doubtthat the Iraqi official, who was foreign minister during thewar, will fully back down or have much leeway to negotiate acompromise. Saddam Hussein doesn't tend to give hisemissaries much independent authority to bargain.   In any event, senior U.S. officials said they will refuseto be drawn into negotiations over the terms under which Iraqwill cooperate with the U.N. efforts to destroy its chemical,biological and nuclear weapons facilities.   Outside of Britain and the U.S., though, there doesn'tseem much enthusiasm for military action. &quot;Iraq has beendestroyed enough,&quot; said a diplomat from one Security Councilnation. And for President Bush, a turn to military actionwould be a high-stakes move in a politically charged electionseason. A quick and error-free mission might be a politicalplus for him, refocusing attention on the Gulf War and hisstrengths in national security. But any mission in whichthere were American losses would pose a ticklish problem.   The Bush administration continues to look for ways to turnup the heat on Saddam Hussein. One idea would be that theU.N. would freeze Iraqi assets, and use some of them tofinance humanitarian aid that U.N. teams would distribute inKurdish and Shiite areas inside Iraq, where many opposeSaddam Hussein's Sunni Muslim-dominated government.   In addition, Iraqi opposition leaders claim that in recentweeks Bush administration aides have met with Kurdish foes ofSaddam Hussein and with at least one prominent former Iraqimilitary leader now in exile. U.S. officials won't comment,although the Bush administration has often said it would liketo incite an insurrection among Iraqi army officers.   Separately, tensions are rising around the Persian Gulfbecause of an unrelated U.S. concern about a North Koreanship suspected of carrying Scud missiles. Though the shipappears headed for Iran, Israel and the U.S. suspect themissiles ultimately may be sent over land to Syria, andIsrael would like to see the shipment stopped. So the U.S. ishinting that it may use ships that are in the region toenforce the economic blockade on Iraq to stop and inspect theNorth Korean ship.</TEXT></DOC>
