For the purpose of Veterans Administration benefits, apay grade is needed only in cases when an individual was killed, or receivedservice-connected injuries or disease, during the recognized period ofactive duty service. A DD Form 1300, or equivalent, shall be issued withthe equivalent pay grade annotated for a member who died during the recognizedperiod of service. A DD Form 214 shall not include pay grade, unless theVeterans Administration requests that a grade determination shall be made.Determinations of equivalent grade shall be based on the following criteriain order of importance:(i) Officially recognized organizational grade or equivalent rank.(ii) The corresponding rank for civilian pay grade.(iii) If neither paragraph (c)(7)(i) nor (ii) of this section applies,only one of three grades may be issued: 0-1, E-4, or E-1.

The extentof control exerted over the group must be similar to that exerted overmilitary personnel and shall be determined by, but not necessarily limitedto, the following factors:(1) <T3>Uniqueness of Service. </T3>Civilian service (civilian employment orcontractual service) is a vital element of the war-fighting capabilityof the Armed Forces. Civilian service during a period of armed conflictis not necessarily equal to active Military service, even when performedin a combat zone. Service must be beyond that generally performed by civilianemployees and must be occasioned by unique circumstances. For civilianservice to be recognized under this Part, the following factors must bepresent:(1) The group was created or organized specifically to fill a wartime need.(ii) If the application is based on service in a combat zone, the missionof the group in a combat zone substantially must have been different fromthe mission of similar groups not in a combat zone.(2) <T3>Organizational Authority Over the Group. </T3>The concept of militarycontrol is reinforced if the military command authority determines thatthe structure of the civilian organization, the location of the group,the mission and activities of the group, and the staffing requirementsshall include the length of employment and pay grades of the members ofthe group.(3) <T3>Integration into the Military Organization. </T3>Integrated civiliangroups are subject to the regulations, standards, and control of the militarycommand authority. Examples include:(i) Exchanging of military courtesies.(ii) Wearing of military clothing, insignia, and devices.(iii) Assimilation of the group into the military organization structure.(iv) Emoluments associated with military personnel; i.e., the use of commissariesand exchanges, and membership in military clubs. A group fully integratedinto the military would give the impression that the members of the groupwere military, except that they were paid and accounted for as civilians.Integration into the military may lead to an expectation by members ofthe group that the service of the group imminently would be recognizedas active military service. Such integration militates in favor or recognition.(4) <T3>Subject to Military Discipline. </T3>During past armed conflicts, U.S.military commanders sometimes restricted the rights or liberties of civilianmembers as if they were military members. Examples include:(i) Placing members under a curfew.(ii) Requiring members to work extended hours or unusual shifts.(iii) Changing duty assignments and responsibilities.(iv) Restricting proximity travel to and from the military installation.(v) Imposing dress and grooming standards. Consequences for noncompliancemight include a loss of some privilege, dismissal from the group, or trialunder military law. Such military discipline militates in favor of recognition.(5) <T3>Subject to Military Justice. </T3>Military members are subject to themilitary criminal justice system. During times of war, ``persons servingwith or accompanying an Armed Force in the field'' are subject to the militarycriminal justice code. Some groups may have been treated as if they weremilitary and subjected to court-martial jurisdiction to maintain discipline.Such treatment militates in favor of recognition.(b) Other factors that may be considered in determining whether the serviceof a civilian or contractual group is equivalent to active duty serviceshall include:(1) <T3>Alliance with the Armed Forces for Protection. </T3>A group that alignsitself with the Armed Forces and submits to military control for its ownwell-being is not deemed to have provided service to the Armed Forces tantamountto active duty Military Service, even though the group may have been:(i) Armed by the U.S. military for defensive purposes.(ii) Routed by the U.S. military to avoid the enemy.(iii) Instructed by the U.S. military for the defense of the group whenattacked by, or in danger of attack by, the enemy, or(iv) Otherwise submitted themselves to the U.S. military for sustenanceand protection.(2) <T3>Permitted to Resign. </T3>The ability of members to resign at willand without penalty militates against military control. Penalty may directand severe, such as confinement, or indirect and moderate, such as difficultand costly transportation from an overseas location.(3) <T3>Prohibition against Members of the Group Joining the Armed Forces.</T3>Organizations formed to serve in a military capacity to overcome theoperation of existing law or treaty militates in favor of recognition underPub. L. 95-202. During World Wars I and II some persons could not be membersof the United States Armed Forces. Women, for example, were prohibitedby law from serving in the Armed Forces. Other persons were prohibitedby treaty from being military members.(4) <T3>Benefits Already Provided Members of a Group. </T3>Recognition of agroup's service by agencies of the Federal, State, or local governmentdoes not militate in favor of recognition under this Part.(c) <T3>Eligibility for Consideration. </T3>To be eligible to apply for considerationunder Pub. L. 95-202 and this Part, a group must have been:(1) Similarly situated to the Women's Air Forces Service Pilots of WorldWar II.(2) Rendered service to the U.S. Armed Forces in a civilian employmentor contractual service capacity.(3) Rendered that service during a period of armed conflict.(d) <T3>Reconsideration.</T3> Groups previously denied a favorable Secretarialdetermination under the law, shall be reconsidered under this Part if thegroup submits evidence that is new, relevant, and substantive. Any requestthat the Board determines does not provide new, relevant, and substantiveevidence shall be returned to the applicant with the reasons for nonacceptance.(e) <T3>Counsel Representation.</T3> Neither the Department of Defense northe Department of Transportation shall provide counsel representation ordefray the cost of such on any matters covered by this part.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 47.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">DoD Civilian and/or Military Service Review Board and Advisory Panel.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Organization and Management.</T3> (1) The Board shall consist of apresident from the Department of the Air Force and one representative fromthe Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Departments of the Army, Navy,and Air Force, and the U.S. Coast Guard (when the group claims active CoastGuard service).
