Lightning killed an Ohio man north of Cincinnati, and a fallingtree injured a child after a funnel cloud reportedly touched downbriefly 25 miles southeast of Columbus, on Saturday night,authorities said.   In Wisconsin, the Coast Guard searched Lake Michigan for astranded boat believed to have two people aboard. In Oklahoma,severe thunderstorms packing winds up to 70 mph tore the roofs offbuildings in Bartlesville. No injuries were reported.   The storms appeared to be the remnants of Hurricane Chantal,which washed ashore in Texas last week, the National WeatherService said.   An overnight storm dumped up to 5 inches of rain on parts ofcentral Vermont. Plainfield, 12 miles east of Montpelier, was theworst hit.   One home was washed away by the rising Great Brook.   Several stretches of road connecting Plainfield and theneighboring town of Orange remained flooded, state Rep. PeterYoungbaer said at an emergency town meeting.   ``There are several families in there, who are isolated betweenwashouts,'' he said. ``One of the priorities is to figure out a wayto get emergency vehicles in there if they're needed.''   Plainfield sits astride the confluence of the Great Brook andthe Winooski River. Yards along the brook were 6 inches deep insilt and were strewn with debris, residents said.   At the River Run Trailer Park in Berlin, the Stevens Branch,another Winooski tributary, overflowed its banks. Dozens ofresidents were forced to flee waist-deep water, state police said.   The river receded by noon and residents returned to their homes.   Main Street in nearby Barre was 6 to 8 inches deep in water fora time, and several businesses' basements were flooded. A car wasseen up to its door handles in water.   Roads were washed out or closed by mudslides in East Montpelier,Northfield, Moretown and East Middlebury.   A musician at King's Island amusement park north of Cincinnatiwas struck by lightning about 6 p.m. as he made his way to his carduring a thunderstorm, said Bill Mefford, manager of marketingcommunications for King's Island.   The victim, Thomas Cahall, 39, of Covington, Ky., was a memberof a Dixieland band hired to entertain guests at the amusementpark, Mefford said.   Another man, Dean Blosser of Urbana, was struck by lightningwhile in Columbus, fire officials said. Blosser was listed inextremely critical condition at St. Ann's Hospital, hospitalofficials said.   A church in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Carthage was heavilydamaged in a three-alarm fire that started as the thunderstormbegan, and a portion of the roof of an apartment building in nearbyFort Mitchell, Ky., was blown off by high winds, officials said.   In Oakland, Ohio, residents reported a funnel cloud, saidFairfield County Sheriff's Deputy Luke Danner.   ``We've got trees and power lines down virtually all over theplace,'' Danner said.   The extent of the child's injuries was not known.   In addition to the homes reported damaged by high winds, severalfires, probably electrical, were reported, Danner said. None of thefires appeared to be serious.   In Iowa, severe thunderstorms packed winds up to 85 mph, peltingcities and farm fields with hail and leaving a trail of brokentrees, damaged buildings and power outages that affected more than15,000 customers.   In western Iowa, about two-thirds of an inch of rain wereaccompanied by winds that stripped leaves from corn stalks, blewdown part of a barn and knocked down tree limbs near Little Sioux.   ``Clouds came in rolling over each other, the sky turned black,the wind came up and the garbage cans took off,'' said Gina Duncan,a convenience store clerk in the central Iowa town of Boone.   Winds hit 75 mph in Wisconsin, where powerful thunderstormsknocked out electrical power to about 15,000 residents and strandedthe boaters.   The overnight storms flooded many streets and caused problems onLake Michigan.   The Coast Guard belives the missing 18-foot boat might have beenblown out on the lake.   Winds as high 75 mph were reported in surburban Milwaukee onFriday night.   Thunderstorms and high winds did similar damage in Nebraska andIndiana.</TEXT></DOC>
