The China Art Gallery show of 113 paintings, photographs,sketches, cartoons and works of calligraphy is the government'slatest effort to justify June's quelling of what it calls a``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''   The exhibit includes several paintings of wounded soldiers, oneof whom shouts ``I'm for the people, the people are for me'' as heis helped through the smoke and fire of the June turmoil by asympathetic citizen.   Another with a similar depiction of a soldier dripping blood hasthe inscription ``the blood of this soldier awakened the people.''   Ink sketches, paintings and photos show soldiers painting fencesand watering plants in the capital, washing clothes together withwomen citizens and giving haircuts to Beijing residents.   Another painting has a young girl drawing a sketch of an armedsoldier, and a poster shows a similar armed soldier with dovesflying in the background and the inscription ``he guards the peopleof the capital.''   A work of calligraphy reads ``the army and the people are asfish and water.''   One cartoon shows a character with a grotesque mouth shaped likea loudspeaker spitting out a tape on which is written ``Voice ofAmerica.''   The U.S. government-run VOA has been denounced by the governmentfor its reports on the pro-democracy movement. VOA has been accusedof aiding those attempting to overthrow the government.   The government propaganda campaign began immediately after theJune 3-4 military attack on student-led demonstrators in whichhundreds, perhaps thousands of people were shot and killed.   State-run television repeatedly broadcast tapes of peoplethrowing rocks and attacking military vehicles and showing thecharred, mutilated bodies of soldiers burned and killed.   Bookstores have sold similar videos and photo albums, alldepicting mob brutality and the heroic deeds of the military butediting out all evidence that soldiers opened fire on unarmedcrowds of people.   The Beijing Daily today said the city was coming out with a bookthat would ``expose the evil doings of elites during the turmoil.''   It said the book would show how people such as dissidentscientist Fang Lizhi, who is now hiding in the U.S. Embassy inBeijing; and political scientist Yan Jiaqi, who fled the countryafter June, fanned rebellion, plotted the overthrow of thegovernment and promoted bourgeois liberalism.   The largest exhibit on the rebellion opened at the MilitaryMuseum in August and drew more than 600,000 people in its firstmonth, mostly students and workers bused in to receive thegovernment's version.   The art exhibit, which opened Tuesday, was more low key, withmost of the viewers being students and young people who hadwandered in after visiting other shows in the gallery.   One university student said he found the exhibit ``veryeducational,'' but most were noncommittal or shied away when askedwhat they thought of the art work. An attendant told reporters theywere not allowed to ask questions.   Despite the barrage of propaganda praising the military, manyBeijing residents, particularly those who joined the springdemonstrations, in private express strong resentment toward thePeople's Liberation Army and its role in the violent suppression ofthe pro-democracy movement.   Martial law remains in effect in Beijing, although most militaryguards were replaced by armed police at the beginning of this month.</TEXT></DOC>
