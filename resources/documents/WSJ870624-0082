At the same hearing, Charles Cox, acting chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the agency is generally against the takeover bills pending in the Senate. But he added that the commission does favor requiring quicker public disclosure of stock purchases by buyers who acquire 5% or more of a company's shares. Current law mandates buyers with such a stake to report their transactions to the SEC within 10 days.    Despite such opposition, support for anti-takeover legislation is strong in Congress, with both the House and Senate considering bills. Efforts to curb takeovers have been sponsored largely by congressional Democrats, who expected resistance from the free-market minded Reagan administration. Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) intends to move the bill he sponsors out of committee before the August congressional recess.    Mr. Sprinkel, whose testimony represented the conclusions of a high-level administration working group, said legislation to curb hostile takeovers could hurt shareholders, lead to a loss of jobs, preempt state regulations, and deter beneficial takeovers. His comments were specifically in reaction to Sen. Proxmire's far-reaching bill.    The bill's effect &quot;would be to impede the market for corporate control and to intrude into areas of corporate governance that should be left primarily to the shareholders and, secondarily, to the states,&quot; Mr. Sprinkel testified.    He cautioned against letting sentiment against insider trading lead to prohibitions on hostile takeovers. He termed insider trading and corporate takeovers as &quot;two separable issues.&quot;    The administration believes hostile takeovers promote market efficiency by weeding out bad management, Mr. Sprinkel said. The administration has said it could support legislation to define insider trading more strictly.    Several senators strongly challenged the administration position, arguing that efficiently managed companies with well-developed assets are the likely targets of hostile takeovers and that measures to defend against takeovers often throw companies heavily into debt. Mr. Sprinkel countered that most corporate debt results from tax laws encouraging debt financing, not from takeovers.    While Mr. Sprinkel opposed the pending legislation on philosophical grounds, Mr. Cox limited most of his objections to technical points. However, he broadly opposed provisions in the bills to block so-called two-tiered tender offers, in which raiders make different price offers to different shareholders. &quot;If enacted, these provisions would mark a dramatic departure from the historic role of federal securities regulation&quot; by interfering with the free market, he argued.    The only major legislative change the SEC official did advocate involved disclosure requirements. Mr. Cox supported the idea of requiring shareholders with 5% or more of a company's shares to report their transactions in the stock within five days, instead of the current 10. And he recommended that such shareholders be prevented from acquiring more of a company's stock until after they make their initial filing that they own more than a 5% share.    The Proxmire bill would require stock purchasers who acquire 3% or more of a company to file within one day. Mr. Cox said a 3% threshold &quot;would generate costs in excess of benefits.&quot; He went on to offer a point-by-point rebuttal of nearly all the provisions called for in the Senate proposal, saying the bills could &quot;impair the depth and liquidity of the markets.&quot;    The Senate package includes provisions that would require large purchasers to identify the source of their financing, extend the time a company has to respond to a takeover offer to 35 days from 20, and require a formal tender offer after 15% or more of a company is purchased.    The measures also would seek to prohibit so-called greenmail payments, or the buyback of stock at a premium above the market price to buy off hostile bidders. In addition, they would ban so-called poison pill and golden parachute provisions from being instituted during takeover attempts. These are designed, respectively, to make a company prohibitively expensive to acquire or to provide substantial bonuses to executives removed as a result of a takeover.    Mr. Cox said that many of the provisions in the Senate package could be better addressed by the SEC, which he said can be more flexible in responding to the evolving takeover environment. He said that extending the tender offer period to 35 days would make it unnecessarily long, and that prohibiting defensive tactics by companies would be an inappropriate intrusion into corporate affairs. He said the poison-pill and golden-parachute provisions would be ineffective because they wouldn't prevent companies from adopting such measures before a takeover attempt.    The Senate proposal also would reaffirm the right of states to enact their own takeover legislation. Representatives of state securities regulators testified in favor of the package. But Mr. Sprinkel said the administration believes that the Senate proposal would actually &quot;preempt any state law regarding corporate governance that favored the interest of shareholders.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
