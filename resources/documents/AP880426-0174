Arafat met with Assad on Monday to try to end a five-year feudbetween two of the Arab world's most influential figures.   Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization'spolitical department, said Arafat would return to Damascus soon,after ``the foundations for a common action'' had been laid in the3{-hourt meeting with Assad.   Kaddoumi also said that a summit meeting grouping Assad, Arafat,Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid and Libyan leader Col. MoammarGadhafi probably would be held next month in either the Libyan orAlgerian capital.   Arafat also met for one hour Tuesday with Vice PresidentAbdul-Halim Khaddam before leaving for Libya aboard a specialplane. He later told reporters his talks in Damascus were ``usefuland will have positive results on the Palestinian and Arab levels.''   Arafat arrived in Syria on Sunday and visited the grave ofKhalil Wazir, Arafat's deputy who was gunned down April 16.   The PLO chief was accompanied on Tuesday's flight to Libya bySalah Khalaf, better known as Abu Iyad, his No. 2 man in Fatah, thePLO's mainstream faction and Arafat's power base.   Arafat left Kaddoumi and other aides behind to work out thedetails of a new Syrian-PLO alliance.   In an interview after Arafat's departure, Kaddoumi said Syriaand the PLO ``have agreed to work together in a joint struggleagainst Israel and U.S. (Middle East peace) plans.''   That was a reference to a peace plan presented by U.S. Secretaryof State George P. Shultz last March. Under the peace plan,Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip would be grantedlimited self-rule.   Palestinians in those territories have been rioting against theIsraeli occupation since Dec. 8.   Both Syria and the PLO rejected the plan and insist on settlingthe Middle East problem through an international peace conferencethat would lead to the creation of a Palestinian state.   Kaddoumi said there was ``complete harmony'' in the stands ofthe PLO and Syria on this issue.   He said ``the uprising in the occupied West Bank is our (Syrianand PLO) first concern. We agree that all our efforts should focuson bolstering the uprising and rallying support for it.''   Kaddoumi, the PLO's chief diplomat, said Syria and the PLO haveworked out details of their new alliance before an extraordinaryArab summit meeting tentatively set for early June in Algiers.   He said both leaders hope they will go to the summit ``withidentical views on all issues, if not a common working paper.''   Rafik al-Natsheh, another Fatah central committee member whoattended the talks in Damascus, said Syria and the PLO had solvedmost of their problems.</TEXT></DOC>
