Certainly there is no shortage of comparative yardsticks.andP;  Forexample, the SPA's annual Software Industry Salary Survey provides usefuldata on sales salaries by job title, company size, and geography (SoftwarePublishers Association, 1101 Conn.andP;  Ave., NW, Washington, D.C.andP;  20036;202/452-1600; price,  $100-$400).andM;But simple paycheck comparisons don't tell the whole story.andP;  More than anyother job function, sales is an area where compensation depends largely onindividual performance, often measured against short-term goals and therelative performance of other salespeople.andP;  The important question in salescompensation isn't the value of an  average&quot; W-2, but rather how to motivateand reward a sales force with the right mix of salary and incentives.andM;To provide a clearer sense of industry-wide trends in this area, we recentlysurveyed our database of companies about paycheck practices for a variety ofsales-related job titles, ranging from senior sales executives to part-timesales associates.andP;  Although we collected standard data about compensationranges, we also probed more deeply into such areas as equity participation,commission structures, sales quotas, and performance goals.andM;By our mid-August cutoff date, 171 companies submitted usable data for thiseffort.andP;  (As usual, we did not accept anonymous survey responses, though thenames of all respondents are confidential.) Since our universe of companiesranged from organizations with as few as two employees to those with morethan a thousand, some survey questions yielded relatively few responses.andP;  Butoverall participation level was high enough that we feel confident that thisreport provides a reasonably accurate picture of current sales compensationtrends in the software industry.andM;Like our previous Benchmark Reports, this special issue of Soft-letter coversthe highlights of our research findings.andP;  For those who wish to explore thesurvey database in more detail, we also provide a data disk with all of ourraw data--except company names--from the survey questionnaires we received.andO;Data disks may be ordered from Soft*letter for $50 prepaid; available diskformats include Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel (DOS) 5.25&quot; and 3.511, and Excel (Mac)3.511.andM;COMPANY DEMOGRAPHICSandM;Our survey questionnaire collected a variety of data about companydemographics, including application categories, product prices, and totalemployee count.andP;  But clearly the most important single factor that affectssales compensation is company size.andP;  Our survey database included 66companies with sales of less than $1 million, 54 companies in the $1-$5million range, and 43 companies with sales over $5 million.andP;  (For statisticalpurposes, we consolidated responses from companies in the $5-$10 million and 10+ million ranges.)andM;In total, the 171 companies in our database employ 9,453 people, with amedian headcount of 13 per company.andP;  When we analyze employment levels interms of company size, important differences appear in the way various salesfunctions are staffed:andM;These numbers suggest an important point about how sales departments areorganized in small and mid-sized companies.andP;  Typically, software companiesseem able to grow into the $1-$5 million range with very simple salesdepartments--a manager, an administrative assistant, and two or threesalespeople, who are most likely to be telemarketing reps.andP;  Only whencompanies pass the $5 million revenue mark do we begin to see more complexsales organizations, with several managers and full-fledged field sales andtelemarketing departments.andM;And, of course, there seem to be significant economies of scale in the salesfunction.andP;  The small companies in our sample devoted 40% of their manpower tosales; large companies, only 18%.andM;SENIOR SALES EXECUTIVESandM;As we expected, our survey data shows a wide range of titles among theexecutives who head the sales organizations of software companies.andP;  The mostcommon title (34 responses) is vice president of sales, followed closely byvice president of sales andamp; marketing (32 responses) and director of sales (28responses).andP;  We also found a significant number of vice presidents ofmarketing who head sales organizations (19 responses), and many nationalsales managers (15 responses).andP;  Finally, 22 owners and presidents reportedthat they currently serve as chief sales officer for their company.andM;Our data also shows some important links between titles and the size of thechief sales executive's paycheck.andP;  Vice presidents of sales top the salarycharts, with a median base salary of $65,000 per year and total incentive payof $25,000.andP;  The 50% range of base salaries in this category (that is, themiddle half of all responses) runs between $42,500 and $103,000.andP;  And theseare the salaries that are growing most rapidly: The median increase incompensation over the prior year's compensation was a healthy 18%.andM;However, an even more important factor in compensation levels is companysize.andP;  Predictably, bigger companies tend to have deeper pockets: Chief salesexecutives in companies with over $5 million in revenues typically earn morethan twice as much as their counterparts in smaller companies:andM;So how do small companies compete for talented sales executives? The magicword is equity.andP;  Although company stock is a common form of compensation forsoftware companies of all sizes (overall, 62% of respondents to this questionreport that the senior sales executive has an equity position in thecompany)--smaller companies offer substantially larger amounts of equity.andP;  Infact, the median ownership share for companies under $1 million in revenue is45%; the median for sales executives in large companies is a modest 1%.andM;In part, sales executives in small companies seem to have earned their largerequity share by participating as founders or co-founders of their companies.andO;moreover, they tend to have joined the company at an earlier (and presumablyrisker) date, and they have stayed longer with the organization.andM;Company size also has considerable impact on how the chief sales executive'sperformance is measured.andP;  As a whole, the software industry tends to focusmost heavily on revenue goals when measuring the effectiveness of seniorsales officers: 45% of our survey respondent's use revenue as a yardstick forincentive payments in this category, compared to 22% who measureprofitability and 7% who measure overall growth.andP;  Larger companies are evenmore likely to emphasize revenue-based performance standards: 55% ofcompanies with over $5 million in sales pay bonuses to their senior salesexecutive based primarily on revenue goals.andM;Among smaller companies, however, performance measurement for salesexecutives seems to take more factors into account.andP;  Revenue goal  s arestill the primary measure for 37% of smaller companies, but profit goals areused almost as often (33%).andP;  And 26% of small companies apparently measureperformance on a case-by-case basis, with incentive bonuses paid at thediscretion of the CEO or board, compared to only 12% of large comPanies thatbase incentive payments on the discretion of top management.andM;REGIONAL SALES MANAGERSandM;Not surprisingly, we received relatively little data about compensation forregional sales managers (defined as &quot;managers who oversee field salesreps&quot;)--and almost all of our responses came from large companies.andP;  However,27 companies did supply us with detailed information about salaries,incentive payments, revenue goals, and regional compensation differences;several other companies provided partial information that helped fill out thepicture.andM;In essence, this data shows that regional managers tend to be compensatedthrough a combination of a base salary (with a median value of $40,000 peryear) and incentive payments (worth about $25,000 per year).andP;  This ratiobetween base salary and incentives, incidentally, is almost exactly the60%/40% ratio that we find is considered ideal for compensating field salesreps (see below).andM;* Geographical differences: Since compensation for regional managers islargely based on the revenue potential for the manager's territory, we alsolooked it differences in total compensation for East Coast, Central, and WestCoast regions.andP;  Despite the popular wisdom that West Coast salaries are theindustry's highest, we found that regional managers in the East have thefattest paychecks:andM;* Sales responsibilities: our survey data also shows that most regionalmanagers are expected to divide their time between management tasks andactual selling.andP;  Sixty-five per cent have &quot;direct sales responsibilities&quot;;the median number of direct accounts that these managers service is 11, witha 50% range of 10-25 accounts.andM;* Incentive basis: Performance goals for regional managers tend to focusexplicitly on revenue generation, both from direct selling and from territorymanagement.andP;  By far the most common basis for incentive payments is&quot;performance against sales goals'  (63%), compared to &quot;discretion ofmanagement' (16%), profit goal&quot;  (9%) and &quot;growth goal&quot;  (9%).andM;FIELD SALES REPSandM;Developing a compensation package for an outbound sales force is anotoriously complicated problem.andP;  The compensation plan has to rewardabove-average skill and effort, yet at the same time it should be perceivedas equitable by average and even below-average reps--who often account formore total revenue than a few superstars.andP;  In addition, incentives shouldfocus the sales force's efforts on the most profitable businessopportunities, without neglecting coverage of more marginal accounts orchannels.andM;For those companies that sell through resellers, there is often a furthercomplication: The selling process is indirect and difficult to track.andP;  Repsmake corporate presentations that can result in large orders that are placedthrough resellers, perhaps even in another territory; at the same time, anaggressive reseller may generate business with no support from a local rep.andM;How do software companies resolve these problems? Typically, we find that repcompensation plans start with a base salary component that reflects theindividual rep's experience and historical performance, with additionalincentive payments based on ongoing future sales performance.andP;  our surveyquestionnaire collected data about pay levels for three performance-basedcategories of sales rep--&quot;top 1/3,&quot;  &quot;middle 1/3,&quot; and  bottom 1/3,&quot; as wellas for an  average&quot; category.andP;  Within these categories, we broke out basesalary numbers, average commission income, and other incentives.andP;  The resultsshow that, with average performance, a sales rep is likely to earn about$50,000 a year.andP;  Reps among the top third of performers will earn about 25%more than average; those in the bottom third will earn about 21% less.andM;We also explored a variety of other issues that are part of field sales repcompensation plans:andM;* Sales quotas: To a large degree, sales quotas (or &quot;revenue targets&quot;) forsoftware products depend on such factors as product price, distributionchannels, competition, and market maturity.andP;  But our survey data reveals somebroad patterns.andP;  Half of our respondents set annual quotas in the400,000-$1,200,000 range for their field sales reps.andP;  And companies typicallyseem to set higher quotas for reps who are superior performers (presumably inreturn for higher base salaries):andM;* Base pay vs.andP;  incentive ratio: A frequently debated issue among salesmanagers is what proportion of rep compensation should be incentive-based.andO;Although we found examples of companies whose compensation is virtually allsalary-based, and others that pay their reps entirely on commission, themedian ratio in our data is 60% base salary to 40% incentive pay.andP;  Moreover,half of all respondents fell within a fairly narrow range defined by a70%/30% salary-to-incentive ratio at one end, and a 50%/50% ratio at theother end.andM;* Commission basis: we asked respondents their basis for calculatingcommissions, and received a variety of answers that primarily reflectdifferences in distribution methods.andP;  Thirty-three percent of respondents paycommissions based on direct sales to end users only, 19% pay commissions onsales to resellers only, and another 19% pay on sales to both end users andresellers.andP;  Another 14% pay on &quot;sell-through&quot; to end-users, while 16% rewardcontributions to profit rather than revenues.andP;  Variable rates.andP;  When acompany's product line includes a mix of products--for example, ahigh-volume, well-established title and a low-volume, newly-launchedtitle--it makes sense to vary the commission rate by product.andP;  We found that23% of respondents to this survey question pay different commission rates byproduct, and 26% vary their rate by channel.andM;* Commission escalators: One fairly common incentive technique is to paycommission rates that increase progressively once a standard sales quota hasbeen met.andP;  Our data shows that commissions typically scale up from 5% ofsales at 100% of quota to 8% at 150%-200% of quota:andM;* Account load.andP;  Like quotas, the number of accounts a rep handles dependspartly on such factors as distribution method, sales volume, and productprice.andP;  But our survey data suggests that a rep can be expected to handleabout 50 active accounts per month (fewer if most of those accounts areresellers):andM;* Sales contests: software companies do not seem to rely regularly oncompetition among reps as an incentive.andP;  only 30% of respondents say theyhold &quot;occasional&quot; sales contests; only one company reported that it runs asales contest every month.andP;  The median cash value of all sales contests inour survey is $500; the 50% range is  $100-$1,000.andM;TELEMARKETING REPSandM;Especially among smaller software companies, a significant amount of salesactivity is often generated by telemarketing or inside sales reps.andP;  In fact,mote companies gave us data on telemarketing pay than on field sales repcompensation, which suggests that the software industry in general may relymore on inside sales forces than on field sales.andM;In developing pay plans for telemarketing reps, sales managers face many ofthe same issues that are raised in field sales compensation.andP;  However,telemarketing departments tend to be staffed by employees with lessexperience and lower sales skills (or at least that's the common perception),so overall pay levels are lower.andM;Thus, telemarketing reps with average skills and performance earn about$20,000 per year in base pay (about two-thirds the base pay of a field salesrep), plus another $10,000 or so in incentive pay (about half the incentivepay of a field sales rep).andP;  The top third of performers earn about 25% more,while the bottom third earn 18% less.andM;Again, our survey questionnaire collected data on a variety of telemarketingrep compensation practices:andM;* Sales quotas: In general, software companies seem to expect lower salesproductivity from telemarketing reps than from a field sales force.andP;  Themedian annual quota or revenue target for telemarketing reps is $300,000,compared to $500,000 for field reps.andP;  (This ratio tracks closely the relativedifference in base pay between the two jobs.) Moreover, the differencebetween quotas for higher and lower performers is relatively modest.andP;  (Notethat the median quota for  all&quot; telemarketing reps in this chart is lowerthan the value for  bottom 1/3&quot;.andP;  This difference probably reflects the factthat companies that could supply data on rep performance levels tend to havelarger telemarketing departments that achieve higher levels of salesproductivity.andM;* Commission escalators: At 100% of quota, telemarketing reps earn mediancommissions of 4% on sales, compared to 5% for field reps.andP;  Above quota,however, the commission plans for the two groups are remarkably similar:andM;* Calls per day: Although one survey respondent claimed that his company'stelemarketing reps were able to make more than 450 calls per day (about oneper minute), we found that the typical telemarketing rep handles about 40calls per day:andM;* Sales contests: only about 4% of companies with telemarketing departmentsreport that they hold monthly sales contests; another 21% run contests on anoccasional basis.andP;  The median value of contest awards is $250, with a 50%range of  $100-$500.andM;SALES ASSOCIATESandM;A growing number of software companies (including many smaller firms) nowrely on part-time sales associates to help with presentations and seminars,or to provide sales coverage in smaller markets.andP;  Our survey data showedseveral trends in compensation for the sales associate category:andM;* Basis for compensation: The most common practice among respondents who usesales associates is to pay only an hourly rate (48%).andP;  Another 29% pay only acommission on sales, while 2% pay only a fee per event.andP;  Another 15%compensate sales associates with a combination of an hourly rate and acommission; 6% pay an hourly rate and a fee per event.andP;  (Among thosecompanies that pay sales associates a commission, the median rate is 10%.)andM;* Hourly rate: The median hourly rate for entry-level sales associates is$8.00, with a 50% range of  6.00-$9.00.andP;  With a year of experience, themedian hourly rate rises to $9.00, with a 50% range of  7.50-$10.00.andP;  Manysales associates work close to a full-time schedule: The median hours perweek for this group is-35 hours, and the 50% range is 25-40 hours.andM;* Event fees: Only six companies provided data on event fees, but these feesare probably fairly typical.andP;  The median fee for a one-hour event is $50; atwo-hour event is $75; a half-day, $100; and a full day, $200.andM;THE IMPACT OF PRODUCT PRICESandM;Finally, one of the most interesting relationships we found in our data isthe link between product prices and compensation levels.andP;  We broke out twocategories of companies--those whose &quot;most popular title&quot; carries a listprice of over $1,000 (26 companies), and those whose &quot;most popular&quot; titlelists for $100 or less (41 companies).andP;  When we compare compensation levelsamong these two groups, the results show a clear pattern of above-averagesalaries among companies with premium-priced titles, and somewhat depressedsalaries among companies that sell low-cost software.andP;  We suspect there's amessage here, though the implications are likely to be hotly debated.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
