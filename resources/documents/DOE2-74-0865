Relying on physical principles to undercover &quot;hidden symmetries&quot;in biological phenomena, the book describes a range of specific problemsin genetics, presents the relevant mathematics, and provides mathematicalreformulations of each problem under consideration. Topics are exploredat three increasingly complex levels - structure, statics, and dynamics- beginning with an examination of various aspects of the genetic codeand, more specifically, an extension of genetic coding theory termedthe generalized genetic code. Finally, a discussion of dynamics providesa differential geometric treatment of biological evolution, phrased atthe molecular level.</TEXT></DOC>
