Walt Disney Studios and NBC are bringing back Davy Crockett andheld an open casting call Sunday to expand the search for an actorto fill the role played on television by Fess Parker in the 1950s.   William Blinn, the executive producer of the show that will bepart of ``The Magical World of Disney,'' said the search has goneon for more than five months and has auditioned more than 800people.   ``It's a quality of strength and intelligence and a kind ofimplied humor that Fess always brought to it, and a kind of drollwarmth. That's hard to find,'' Blinn said.   The producer said he wasn't interested in a ``Rambo'' sort ofhero or the muscle-bound characters played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.   ``They don't offer humor in their portrayal, nor do they offerto me a guy that is at ease with himself _ they have a great dealof tension,'' Blinn said.   The series, scheduled to premiere in November, is based on thelife of Crockett, a frontiersman who fought river pirates andIndians and served in the Tennessee Legislature in the 1820s and1830s.   The old show's theme song identified Crockett as the frontierking who was born on a mountaintop in Tennessee.   Kevin DuBay, one of the more than 75 actors at the casting call,said he had a coonskin cap and watched reruns of the series as achild.   ``It was important when you played cowboys and Indians to knowwho Davy Crockett was,'' the 25-year-old said.   Joel Mills, 27, said he shares a love of the outdoors withCrockett and believes it is important to have old-fashioned heroeslike Crockett.   ``I think our children deserve better than Rambo,'' he said.   Parker will appear in the first two-hour episode as an elderstatesman reflecting on his youth.   The new ``Davy Crockett'' will be rotated on NBC's weekly ``TheMagical World Of Disney'' with other features, including cartoonsand a re-creation of ``The Absent-Minded Professor'' with HarryAnderson in the title role.</TEXT></DOC>
