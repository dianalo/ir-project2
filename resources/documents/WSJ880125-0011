<DOC><DOCNO> WSJ880125-0011 </DOCNO><HL> Business Brief: Westmoreland Coal Co. </HL><SO> </SO><CO> WMOR </CO><TEXT>   Westmoreland Coal Co., Philadelphia, said it will report a 1987 fourth-quarter charge of $48.9 million related to its Colorado Westmoreland Inc. subsidiary, representing a write-down of its investment in the unit and establishment of reserves for certain future costs.    In the 1986 fourth quarter, Westmoreland had a loss of $1.4 million, including a $2.9 million loss on the sale of a unit, on revenue of $146.1 million. A spokesman declined to comment on whether the charge would result in a loss for the year. For the 1987 first nine months, the company earned $10.5 million, or $1.27 a share, on revenue of $477.5 million.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Westmoreland shares closed at $18, down 25 cents.    The company said Colorado Westmoreland is continuing to operate its mine but doesn't expect it to be profitable at least through the early 1990s, because of market competition and an unfavorable court decision. It said the decision last August, in federal court in Indiana, concerned how much coal must be burned by the primary customer of Colorado Westmoreland, Northern Indiana Public Service Co. </TEXT></DOC>
