The fare increases, which were planned before the laborstrike, result from higher fuel and other operating costs andthe cut in state subsidies under the new government'seconomic overhaul program, a railway official told PAP.</LP><TEXT>   The railroad had used government subsidies to keep faresunrealistically low.   For example, a first-class ticket for the three-hourexpress train ride from Warsaw to Gdansk cost about threedollars before the increases, and even less before theinflation surge of the second half of 1989.   Wildcat strikers snarled freight and passenger service tonorthwest Poland from May 20 until Monday, when Solidarityleader Lech Walesa persuaded the workers to return to theirjobs and give the government until June 13 to consider theirdemands.   The government, not veering from its anti-inflationeconomic overhaul plan, had refused to consider pay raisesfor the workers while the strike was on.   However, officials said a plan, including new pay scales,was being drafted to restructure the railroad for Poland'spost-Communist, market-driven economy.</TEXT></DOC>
