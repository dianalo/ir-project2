All but three of the 16 analysts expect interest rates to be higher by year end. But many expect only small increases, followed next year by slower economic growth, moderate inflation and lower interest rates.    &quot;The economy just is too strong right now. We're definitely going to have higher rates,&quot; contended Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank. &quot;It's only a matter of time before we see some inflationary impact&quot; from stronger growth.    Edward S. Hyman, vice chairman of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., agrees that the economy's apparent slowdown last month will prove short-lived. &quot;It was just due to the drought,&quot; he said. Employment data for September, to be released Oct. 7, &quot;will be stronger, so I think inflation fears will come back, and interest rates will go back up again.&quot;    Federal Reserve officials are likely to tighten credit further late this year, after Election Day, to combat inflation pressures, most of the economists predicted. Many fear that inflation will rise if the economy grows at more than a 2 1/2% annual pace, and nearly everyone expects faster growth than that in the fourth quarter.    Among the major conclusions in the survey:   --The economy this quarter expanded at a 3.4% rate, after adjusting for inflation, according to the average estimate of the 16 analysts surveyed. That would compare with a 3% rate in the second quarter and a 3.4% pace in the first three months.    --In the fourth quarter, business will expand at just under a 3% clip. But estimates vary enormously. For example, David Levine of Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. predicts a booming 5.7% growth rate, but Irwin Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. expects only a 1.4% rate.    --The economy still is expanding briskly even though the summer drought and intense heat cut significantly into growth. Because of these factors, many analysts have cut their growth forecasts significantly both for this quarter and the fourth quarter.    --Consumer spending remains strong, along with business spending on new equipment. Consumer confidence is running at a high level. Also, exports have grown rapidly.    The most bearish interest-rate forecast, as usual, came from Mr. Levine of Sanford C. Bernstein. &quot;I don't think the Fed has tightened nearly enough to rein in the economy,&quot; he said. He predicted that the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, now just over 9%, will soar to about 11 1/2% by mid-1989.    Those expecting lower rates by year end are Alan Reynolds of Polyconomics Inc., Lawrence Kudlow of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., and Mr. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover. Mr. Kellner predicted that the prime, or base, rate, now 10%, will drop to 9 1/2% by year end and 8 1/4% by the middle of next year.    &quot;The world's central banks have been enormously effective in damping inflation,&quot; said Mr. Reynolds of Polyconomics in Morristown, N.J. He cited falling commodity prices, especially gold, one of the most closely watched indicators of inflation pressures. &quot;Anything over 9% (on long-term Treasury bonds) is a bargain,&quot; he said.    Merrill Lynch officials said rates may rise slightly further but then will drop sharply over the next year or so. They have been urging investors to take advantage of any weakness in bond prices to increase their holdings. They also recommend interest-rate-sensitive stocks. &quot;The time to buy is now,&quot; according to a recent Merrill Lynch advertisement.    One reason to accept Merrill Lynch's advice is that it runs directly contrary to the majority view, which rarely is right in forecasting interest rates. Early this year, for example, many analysts contended that the economy was weak and that interest rates would drop. Rates did fall for awhile but then began to surge in February. Since then, some short-term rates have surged about 1 1/2 percentage points, while long-term Treasury bond yields have increased nearly 3/4 of a percentage point.    Bond prices rebounded early this month after the government's August employment report indicated slower economic growth. But now a growing number of analysts contend that investors overreacted to that report and that the September report to be released Oct. 7 will show stronger growth.    &quot;We'll see some further evidence of strengthening&quot; of the economy, leading to additional credit tightening by the Fed within a few months, said Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor and now chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington, D.C.    Robert T. McGee, economist at Irving Trust Co., agrees that the Federal Reserve will raise rates further late this year. &quot;I think basic pressures on wages and capacity are going to build&quot; as the economy continues expanding, he said.    The economy &quot;has a lot of vitality,&quot; said Robert Chandross, a vice president at Lloyds Bank in New York. &quot;It's going to make people in the bond market skittish about inflation.&quot;    ---                     Economic Forecasts                     Growth in percent                            1988        1988                           THIRD      FOURTH                         QUARTER     QUARTER    Jay N.
