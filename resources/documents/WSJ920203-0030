When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed a ban onmost uses of ethylene bisdithiocarbamate fungicides in 1989,it offered industry a way out: If a survey of grocery shelvesshowed that the health risk from foods made from EBDC-treatedcrops fell within EPA guidelines, the ban wouldn't have totake effect. The agency's analysis, which had shown that thechemicals posed an unacceptably high risk of cancer, had beenbased on tests on crops in the fields.   Makers of the chemicals voluntarily halted most usescovered by the proposed ban as of Jan. 1, 1990. Theseincluded EBDC use on apples, pears, carrots, celery,cucumbers, squash and tobacco. Some uses -- on crops such asgrapes, peanuts and asparagus -- weren't covered by theproposed ban or the voluntary withdrawal.   The four makers of the chemical -- BASF, Du Pont, ElfAtochem and Rohm andamp; Haas -- have now completed the $10 millionstudy, which looked at samples in hundreds of cities ofgroceries made from treated crops. Janet Ollinger, a Rohm andamp;Haas productregistration manager, says that &quot;for the vastmajority of samples, there was no measurable residue.&quot;   The EPA may announce its decision as early as this week.Officials say many of the uses covered by the proposed banare likely to be allowed, so long as they don't result in acancer risk of more than one in a million in the course of alifetime. Ms. Ollinger says the industry is especiallyinterested in resuming use of the chemical on apples,lettuce, peppers, watermelons, honeydew melon, cucumbers,broccoli, cabbage and dried beans.   Rick Hind, legislative director of Greenpeace's toxicscampaign, charges that if the EPA allows these chemicals backon the market, it will &quot;be using the population as guineapigs. This is a very potent carcinogen.&quot;                                                                                                          Scarce Black Bears   Attract a Following                                                                                                          THE TEDDY bear may be poised for a comeback in Louisiana.   As acrimony over the spotted owl and other threatened orendangered species grabs the headlines, environmentalists andindustry are quietly working together to rescue the blackbear. The bear, which got its nickname in the early 1900safter Teddy Roosevelt refused to shoot one while hunting,numbered around 50,000 in the Southeastern U.S. in the early1800s. These days only about 200 remain, mostly in Louisiana.In December, the Interior Department listed it as threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act.   A year before that, the Black Bear Conservation Committeewas born. This group, including representatives from federaland state agencies, environmental groups, universities andthe timber industry, plans to complete a bear-restorationplan by June. Already, it has helped persuade the state toraise the penalty for killing a black bear to $10,000 and setup a bear newsletter and a bear coordinator's office.   Jimmy Bullock, wildlife manager for Anderson-Tully, aMemphis, Tenn., timber company, says, &quot;The bear seemscompatible with good forest-management practices.&quot; MurrayLloyd, conservation chairman of the Louisiana Sierra Club,agrees, &quot;It turned out this wasn't as much of a problem aspeople seemed to think.&quot;   But Defenders of Wildlife, a Washington-based group,contends that the bear should be classified as endangered,rather than threatened, and that critical habitat should beset aside while a recovery plan is worked out.                                                                                                          White House May Join   War Against Warming   JOHN SUNUNU'S departure raises the possibility of a shifton global-warming policy by the White House.   The former chief of staff was an ardent opponent ofinternational efforts to curb the atmospheric buildup ofcarbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which manyscientists believe threaten to cause a disastrous warming ofthe Earth. Now that Mr. Sununu is gone, there are suggestionsthe administration may want to move on the issue.   His successor, Samuel Skinner, has had one meeting andseveral conversations with the EPA on the topic. While theWhite House remains opposed to specific targets, &quot;there maybe some kind of goal within the realm of possibility,&quot;according to an official familiar with the negotiations.Nations would agree to try to stabilize per-capita emissionsby some date without promising to do so.   EPA Administrator William Reilly recently asked his staffto look for new ideas that might be acceptable to the WhiteHouse. The agency is working on a package of voluntary energyconservation programs modeled after the Green Lights program,under which the EPA urges companies to replace inefficientlighting. &quot;There is, in a small way, some indication thatthey may be moving,&quot; says David Gardiner, Sierra Clublegislative director.   Whether this translates into concrete action may be moreapparent next month in New York, when representatives ofabout 100 countries will meet to continue work on aclimate-change treaty scheduled to be signed at June's EarthSummit in Rio de Janeiro.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          PORTIONS of the stage from the halftime show of the SuperBowl will be recycled into stage props for community theatersand building insulation by the set's creator, VEE ofMinneapolis. . . .
