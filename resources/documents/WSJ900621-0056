Reed has used phrases like &quot;consistent&quot; and&quot;predictable&quot; to describe his earnings objectives for thenation's largest banking company.   &quot;My goal is to be boring,&quot; he once told securitiesanalysts.</LP><TEXT>   But &quot;disappointing&quot; more accurately describes Citicorp'sperformance under Mr. Reed, the wunderkind who built theCitibank consumer business. In the past decade, Citicorp hasachieved its earnings goal only once, in 1988.   Now, investors, who once patiently conceded that Mr.Reed's vision of a global financial-services company couldn'tbe realized overnight, are increasingly questioning whetherhe will achieve his goals -- 18% return on equity and 15% to20% annual growth in earnings per share -- anytime soon.Citicorp's first-quarter results strongly suggest it won'thappen this year. Says Mr. Reed: &quot;That's a good bet.&quot;   Typical of restive Citicorp shareholders is Kevin McCarey,a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments. Saying that at ameeting with Citicorp officials a month ago some investorswere &quot;berating them,&quot; Mr. McCarey adds: &quot;Everyone, includingus, is getting impatient because their consumer business isgoing so well and more of the positive effect should bereflected in the stock price.&quot;   The 51-year-old Mr. Reed, the company's largest individualshareholder, understands their frustrations: &quot;You could sayour stock stinks, which is true.&quot; Yesterday, it closed at$22.50, down 37 1/2 cents a share on the day and well belowits book value of $25.36 a share.   Much of the disappointment with earnings in recent yearsis attributable to soured Third World loans. But as thatproblem receded somewhat, investors expected Citicorp'stremendous consumer business to propel earnings to newheights. However, those hopes have been dashed by a slump incommercial real estate and corporate takeovers andrestructurings. Now, borrowers such as Campeau Corp., AmesDepartment Stores and Donald Trump are replacing Brazil andArgentina as the main problems dragging down Citicorp'searnings and stock price. (The bank's Trump debt, largelysecured by the developer's properties, exceeds $200 million.)   &quot;While John Reed has done a lot of the right things,there's good reason to get upset with Citicorp,&quot; says NancyYoung, an analyst for the College Retirement Equities Fund, alarge stockholder. &quot;We see all these goodies {in its consumerbusiness} and wonder why aren't we reaping more of thebenefits. In their zeal to invest in the future, they forgetabout today. I don't have any problem with their investmentsin the information business and other areas, but there has tobe some kind of balance.&quot;   As troubled loans rise, Citicorp's reserve and capitallevels are looking skimpy. In both areas, Citicorp comes inat or near the bottom among big U.S. banks: Its reserves areonly 56% of nonperforming loans, while many big competitors'reserves are at about 70% or more, and its common-stockequity is below that of almost all its rivals. By someestimates, Citicorp needs $2 billion in additional capitaland reserves.   Citicorp is &quot;leaving a thin margin for error,&quot; saysKenneth Pinkes of Moody's Investors Service.   The low levels of capital and reserves recently led themajor debt-rating agencies to downgrade most ratings onCiticorp's debt. The result: Citicorp will pay a slightlyhigher price when borrowing money in the commercial-papermarket. Next to consumer deposits, commercial paper --short-term IOUs -- has been Citicorp's cheapest source offunds.   The credit downgrading and weak stock price may, in turn,curtail Citicorp's expansion just as it is prowling foracquisitions in Europe and in California, which is openingitself up to full-blown interstate banking in 1991.   Indeed, Citicorp may be reconciled to sitting on thesidelines. It recently agreed to purchase tiny DeAnza Bank,of San Jose, Calif. California bankers interpret the $35million acquisition as a signal that Citicorp may forgoseeking to buy First Interstate Bancorp., a long-rumoredtarget, or another major institution there in favor of usingDeAnza to grow a branch at a time. Citicorp itself says it issimply keeping its options open. (Since 1986, it has owned asavings and loan association, recently renamed Citibank FSB,in the San Francisco Bay area.)   Citicorp dismisses criticism from Moody's and Standard andamp;Poor's that it needs proportionately higher reserves. Thecompany argues that its far-flung, diverse portfolio makes itunique among U.S. banks. Thomas E. Jones, Citicorp'sexecutive vice president for financial controls, audit andtaxes, says that in its worst years write-offs of bad loansnever exceeded 20% of nonperforming loans.   Moreover, he says, one-third of the amounts written offare eventually recovered. During the 1970s, Citicorp says,the bank ultimately recouped half of what it wrote off onreal-estate loans through sales of foreclosed properties andother means.   But bankers and analysts see in the downgrading of thenation's only truly global bank symbolic implications faroutweighing the pennies per share that it will costshareholders. &quot;At the margin, capital markets are being shutdown to the nation's largest bank,&quot; says Charles Peabody, aKidder, Peabody andamp; Co. analyst.   Rather than knuckle under to calls for greater reservesand more emphasis on short-term profits, Mr. Reed takes adamn-the-torpedoes attitude. He refuses to cut bait onseveral poor acquisitions that he made, such as its Arizonabank, two Sandamp;Ls and the Quotron subsidiary. He insists thatreserves are adequate and that capital will be replenishedthrough asset sales and retained earnings. New shares will beissued only for a major acquisition, he adds.   Mr. Reed, who relishes his reputation as a maverick,always has had a penchant for risk-taking. As a juniorexecutive at Citicorp, he undertook what many regarded as ano-win task: streamlining its back office and dataprocessing. Later, while building the consumer business, Mr.Reed came close to being fired for his nonchalant attitudetoward years of mounting losses, former Citicorp officialssay. In his most celebrated move since becoming chairman, hethrew down the gauntlet to deadbeat borrowers such as Brazil:His surprise $3 billion addition to reserves in 1987 implieda willingness to halt any further lending to such countries.   In April, Mr. Reed's bravado surfaced again. Citicorpthumbed its nose at critics by announcing a 9.9% increase inthe dividend at the same time its write-offs of bad loanssoared 79% and first-quarter earnings plunged 56%.   Yet, Mr. Reed clearly feels the pressure to improveperformance. The clearest sign was his decision in January toname Richard S. Braddock to the long-vacant presidency. Mr.Braddock, who had headed the consumer business, is a muchmore hands-on manager than Mr. Reed, who prefers dealing withstrategic issues rather than nuts-and-bolts administration.Now, Mr. Braddock is reviewing individual businesses'progress on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis, enablingthe bank to respond more quickly to developing problems.   To be sure, Mr. Reed has delivered on many of hispromises. For the first time this year, Citicorp's consumerbusiness will earn more than $1 billion, more than a fivefoldincrease since he became chairman. The consumer bank'searnings are growing by at least $100 million a year, andCiticorp continues to invest heavily in global expansion andin new technology, such as its new home-banking terminal, the&quot;Enhanced Telephone.&quot;   In addition, Citicorp is in a neck-and-neck race withAmerican Express Co. to be the world's biggest issuer ofcharge and credit cards. It also has become the nation'sbiggest originator and servicer of residential mortgages.   And despite the criticism of Citicorp's reserve position,it is in better shape than it was under Walter Wriston, Mr.Reed's predecessor. When Mr. Reed became chairman, reserveswere less than $1 billion; today, after increases in 1987 and1989, they total $4.6 billion. And in the past three years,Citicorp has worked down its developing-country debt to an$8.4 billion problem from an $11 billion one.   &quot;We've actually made some pretty good progress against ourvision&quot; of what the bank should do, Mr. Reed says. For muchof his chairmanship, his energies have been consumed by thedeveloping-countries debt problem. &quot;I can't begin to tell youthe degree of distraction that it has been,&quot; he says. &quot;Ipersonally think that when we look back on this period we'llgive ourselves pretty high marks for how we managed theproblem.&quot;   &quot;I give him good marks, not top marks,&quot; Ronald Mandle, ananalyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., comments. &quot;He's morevisionary than most bankers, and he's bought shares with hisown money, unlike other New York bank managements. Hisinterests are more aligned with shareholders.&quot;   Mr. Reed complains, however, that something beyond thebank's control has repeatedly cropped up and kept it fromachieving its financial goals. What he calls the&quot;externalities&quot; blighting the 1990 outlook are the weakeningcommercial-real-estate market and the disappearance of highlyleveraged corporate buy-outs.   So, when will the dark clouds blow away? &quot;My guess,&quot; Mr.Reed says, &quot;is that you're going to see that in 1992 to1995.&quot; By then, he explains, the danger of developing-countryloans will have been defused, and real-estate markets shouldbe rebounding.   Citicorp is the nation's largest lender on commercial realestate. Since 1985, Citicorp's portfolio of such loans hasmore than doubled to $12.8 billion. However, its past-duereal-estate loans and foreclosures have surged fivefold to$1.6 billion from $303 million. Further increases are likely;downturns in real-estate cycles typically last two to threeyears. Similarly, Citicorp's $7.9 billion of loans to highlyleveraged transactions includes nearly $700 million of loansin trouble.   As big as the numbers are, those two types of loans poseless of a threat to Citicorp than to other banks.Commercial-real-estate loans make up only 10% and highlyleveraged transactions only 5% of Citicorp's $160 billionloan portfolio. Most large banks show higher percentages.   Moreover, Citicorp's real-estate portfolio is welldiversified geographically. Only 3% of it is in hard-hit NewEngland; the largest exposure, 21%, is in the healthyCalifornia market.   Citicorp contends that even in troubled leveragedbuy-outs, such as Campeau's Allied and Federated units, whichowe Citicorp $288 million, its position is fully secured andinsulated against losses. But banks do lose money on somedeals.   For all today's problem loans, Mr. Reed is upbeat aboutCiticorp's prospects. &quot;If you're concerned about mytemperature,&quot; he says, &quot;I'm feeling better about where we arethan I was three years ago.&quot;   To unleash the profit potential of the consumerbusinesses, analysts and consultants suggest that Citicorpshould dump its money-losing Quotron subsidiary, slash staffand expenses and cut deeply into commercial lending in NorthAmerica, Europe and Japan. Though once accounting for nearlyall of Citicorp's earnings, commercial banking in thedeveloped countries may earn only $160 million this year.&quot;Traditional commercial banking, as practiced by most banks,is only a 7% return-on-equity business,&quot; says James McCormickof First Manhattan Consulting Group.   Citicorp has reined in some commercial-banking activities.In commercial real estate, for instance, Citicorp isstressing less risky roles for itself, such as arrangingsales, debt and equity investments. In the past month, Mr.Reed has met individually with more than three dozen ofCiticorp's large real-estate customers to gauge marketconditions and to assure them that the bank isn't abandoningthe business.   Citicorp also has shut down -- with much embarrassment --big money-losing ventures, such as its Citicorp ScrimgeourVickers securities dealer in London and its underwriting ofmunicipal securities in the U.S. And it is pursuing itshard-won corporate securities underwriting powers with farless elan than Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan andamp;Co.   Meanwhile, Michael A. Callen, who heads Citicorp'scommercial and investment banking for North America, Europeand Japan, is preparing a plan to focus Citicorp's resourceson about six profitable lines of business, according to bankofficers. However, Mr. Reed rejects suggestions that he shutdown traditional commercial-banking businesses in thedeveloped countries. &quot;Intellectually and culturally, it'sstill the heart of the business,&quot; and a &quot;solid&quot; commercialbusiness can be built in those nations, he says. &quot;There arevery few consumer-only financial companies that areexciting.&quot;   The information business, which in the first quarter ofthis year lost money at a $164 million annual rate, isanother drain on earnings that is off-limits to cost-cutters.Much of that loss is simply amortization of the premium paidin the $628 million acquisition of Quotron in 1986. However,with all the cost-cutting on Wall Street, the stock-priceservice is losing money on an operating basis, too.   All along, Mr. Reed has said the information business isin the incubation stage and won't contribute significantly toprofits until the mid-1990s. Citicorp is investing heavily init. It is developing a consumer marketing information systemthat gives retailers new ways to target consumers forpromotions. And Quotron is developing a trading terminal forgovernment bond dealers and a foreign-exchange tradingterminal, called FX Trader, that shows promise of makinginroads against Reuters Holdings PLC's rival service. Lastyear, Telerate Inc., which is owned by Dow Jones andamp; Co., thepublisher of this newspaper, also introduced its ownelectronic foreign-exchange trading system, The TradingService.   Mr. Reed confidently predicts Citicorp earnings willtriple to $5 billion by the mid to late 1990s. However, manyinvestors, weary of unfulfilled promises, can't help butwonder whether Mr. Reed is referring to some massaged measureof earnings. But others remain optimistic.   &quot;In 10 years, the question investors will ask each other,&quot;says Heiko Thieme, a fund manager at Deutsche Bank CapitalCorp., &quot;will be: `Did you buy Citicorp?' Not, `What did youpay for it?'&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
