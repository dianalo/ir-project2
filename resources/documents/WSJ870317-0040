But the five-member panel of outside medical experts, whose recommendation is not binding on the FDA, expressed skepticism about Upjohn's claims for the extent of the drug's effectiveness. It also suggested careful monitoring of the Kalamazoo, Mich., pharmaceutical company's marketing and labeling of the product.    The advisory group also said that while the drug, minoxidil, has been found to have relatively few adverse side effects, further studies should be done once the drug is in widespread use. As previously reported, one FDA staff review similarly suggested that additional studies be made.    Ever since Upjohn first said it was working on the drug, which would be sold under the name Rogaine, its shares have jumped sharply on any news indicating possible approval. But in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Upjohn fell to as low as $129 and closed at $135.25, down $3.50.    Analysts said that the stock price before yesterday's hearing already reflected the expected committee recommendation, and that the drop reflected the unanticipated reservations of the panel. &quot;The expectations in the market were probably for better efficacy data,&quot; said Joseph Riccardo of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;Those expectations will probably have to be cut back somewhat.&quot;    Most analysts who attended the hearing said, however, they still are enthusiastic about the potential benefits of minoxidil for Upjohn.    The FDA still must approve the drug before it can be sold in the U.S. But one agency official who attended the meeting said that while the FDA has overturned advisory recommendations in the past, it is &quot;highly infrequent.&quot; He said the agency probably would reach a decision in the next few &quot;weeks to months.&quot;    The hair treatment already has been cleared for sale in 13 countries. The prescription lotion went on sale in Canada in October and was sold to about 24,500 patients by mid-February, an Upjohn official said at the meeting. Minoxidil already is used orally in the U.S. to fight hypertension.    In a statement, Upjohn said it was pleased with the committee recommendation. A spokesman said after the hearing that the committee questions weren't unusual in the drug-approval process and that the company didn't view the discussion as a challenge to its general presentation of the drug.    Dr. Richard De Villez, an Upjohn researcher, told the committee and the gathering of more than 200 securities analysts and other observers that a company study of 1,833 patients using Rogaine found that 40% had &quot;moderate to dense&quot; hair growth after a year of use. He added that the solution would be more effective for &quot;younger men who have been balding for a shorter period.&quot;    But several members of the committee questioned Upjohn's definition of satisfactory growth. Dr. Robert S. Stern, a dermatologist from Beth Israel Hospital in Boston who chaired the hearing, said that &quot;there are a variety of ways of presenting the data.&quot; He said he read Upjohn's numbers to mean that the success rate would &quot;be more in the range of 20%.&quot;    He also criticized the company for discontinuing its comparable testing of a placebo drug four months into the study, making it difficult to discern how much of the new growth witnessed actually came from Rogaine. In addition, he said that the effectiveness probably would be less when the drug is in general use, where the company has less control over who uses the drug and how.    Dr. De Villez acknowledged under questioning that it could take as long as eight months before patients knew whether the drug worked for them, and that even at its best it never would cure baldness near the forehead.    &quot;My main concern is, I don't know what to tell the patient,&quot; said a committee member, Dr. Paul R. Bergstrasser, a dermatology professor at the University of Texas. &quot;I don't know whether he might be the lucky one in seven.&quot;    Committee members also said the drug can be costly and has to be used indefinitely for new hair to stay. They made their recommended approval contingent on &quot;changes in the labeling that reflect the concerns of the committee.&quot;    Last May, an FDA official accused Upjohn of exaggerating Rogaine's effectiveness in a company news release. Upjohn denied the charges.    In considering safety questions at yesterday's hearing, the advisory panel decided that &quot;the benefits outweigh the risks&quot; in general. But it added that men more than 50 years old and any patients with a history of cardiovascular problems should use caution when using Rogaine. The earlier FDA staff study found that the chief side effect from the drug was skin reactions, such as rashes. There also were incidents of chest pains and heart palpitations, among other things, but a former FDA official, who directed that study, has said that those incidents &quot;most likely&quot; weren't due to Rogaine.    Dr. Stern said that people already are grinding up minoxidil in its pill form and using it to promote hair growth. Therefore, he said, even though some safety questions remain, formal approval of Rogaine would let the agency better control the drug's use. </TEXT></DOC>
