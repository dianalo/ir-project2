The question has arisenas to the safety of launching highly radioactive material such as plutonium-238,related to the possibility of its dispersion into the atmosphere duringa launch vehicle explosion. An alternative is the use of a small nuclearreactor which is not started until it is in space and contains littleor no radioactivity at launch. Their study entailed a first order assessmentof six small reactor concepts with power levels up to 100 MWe. They investigatedboth the nuclear feasibility of these concepts to operate at their ratedpower levels between 7 and 10 years and to capability of these conceptsto remain subcritical both before and during launch and also in the caseof water immersion during a potential launch failure or abort.</TEXT></DOC>
