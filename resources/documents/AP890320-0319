The losses occurred despite strong operating results for its7-Eleven stores.   Revenue amounted to $1.97 billion in the three months ended Dec.31 and $7.99 billion in all of 1988.   Because of the buyout, the seven months ended July 31, 1987 werereported on a separate accounting basis than subsequent periods,which means results from the two periods within 1987 cannot be addedtogether to produce 1987 full-year financial results, and nofull-year comparisons can be made between 1987 and 1988.   Southland's 1988 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciationand amortization was $494.3 million, including $16.5 million fromdivested operations, the company said.   Jere W. Thompson, Southland's president and chief executiveofficer, called that figure ``the most appropriate measure of ourprogress.''   ``We're very pleased overall with the company's operating andfinancial achievements during its first full year after undergoingone of the largest leveraged buyouts in history,'' Thompson said ina prepared statement.   Southland added 600 convenience stores to its 7-Eleveninternational operation in 1988. The division now includes nearly5,300 stores operated by licensees and affiliates in the UnitedStates and 19 foreign countries.   Southland operates about 7,000 additional convenience stores inthe United States and Canada, and owns a 50 percent interest inCitgo Petroleum Corp.   The company has completed the sale of 910 operating conveniencestores and virtually all of its other businesses scheduled fordivestiture as part of the LBO.   To date, the company has repaid $977.5 million of its original$2.55 billion LBO bank debt.</TEXT></DOC>
