The court, without comment, rejected appeals by Texas stateofficials and gas producers who challenged orders of the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission.   At issue were gas reserves under a panhandle area 124 miles longand 20 miles wide.   The commission in 1984 identified 37 oil well operators it saidwere interfering with the interstate sale of gas found under thesame land as the oil wells.   Because of the underground formations in the Panhandle, oil welloperators often must drill through gas-bearing rock to reach thelower-lying oil deposits.   The commission said the oil well operators were taking gasintended for interstate sales and selling it within Texas forhigher prices.   The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 permits some hard-to-producegas to be sold at higher prices to encourage gas production. Thelaw requires gas previously committed to interstate commerce to besold at lower prices.   The Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates gas production inthe state, joined the oil well operators in claiming the federalagency exceeded its authority and mistakenly classifed thePanhandle gas.   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in April upheld thefederal commission's orders, saying it found ``overwhelming supportfor the reasonableness'' of the agency's decisions.   Bush administration lawyers urged the justices to leave theappeals court ruling undisturbed.   The cases are Railroad Commission vs. FERC, 89-196, and WalkerOperating Corp. vs. FERC, 89-394.</TEXT></DOC>
