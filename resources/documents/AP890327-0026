Byrd, the United StatesSenate over the last 200 years has been a rock-bound channel, ableto contain the onrushing passions of the moment without losing itsessential and original shape and purpose.   Byrd, in what he calls a ``labor of love,'' has pursued thattheme in a seven-pound history of the institution as it developedover the past two centuries.   The book, called ``The Senate _ 1789-1989'' and availablethrough the Government Printing Office, is a lavishly illustratedand meticulous account based on 42 of the 100 speeches Byrddelivered on the floor of the Senate in an unprecedented seriesthat began on a spring morning in 1980.   ``One of my two granddaughters was in the gallery with othermembers of her fifth-grade class,'' Byrd recalls. ``I decided Ishould mark the occasion by talking a little about the Senate andits history for that class.   ``I had no notes; I spoke for an hour,'' he said.   On the next Friday his older granddaughter was in the galleryand Byrd decided to make another speech in her honor.   ``But I thought I ought to make a different speech, so I talkedabout the traditions and the customs of the Senate. That's how itstarted; that was the seed of the idea. I determined there wasfully enough material to do 100 speeches on the Senate. I saw thatit was going to take a number of years.''   For most of the next decade, when the business of the Senate hadbeen completed for the day, Byrd rose to advance his projectanother notch, delivering what a generation of Senate clerks andpages, and doorkeepers, reporters and fellow senators came to call``Byrd's history lessons.''   The result is a narrative history of the Senate from theuncertain first steps of the first Congress in the late winter andspring of 1789 through the calamity of civil war in the 1860s andthe Senate Watergate investigation of the 1970s.   The assembly of those speeches into a book was a``mini-Manhattan Project,'' Byrd says, proudly noting that heproofread the book five times _ ``every comma, every colon, everyem-dash.''   To Byrd, the most remarkable fact about the Senate's 200 yearsis the way that historic themes tend to repeat themselves.   Is there concern over the negative tone of last year'spresidential campaign? he asks.   Then consider, Byrd says, the campaign of 1828 when thepartisans of John Quincy Adams called rival Andrew Jackson ``agambler, a drunkard and a duelist'' as well as an adulterer, andJackson supporters retaliated in kind, portraying Adams as ``amonarchist, a gourmandizer and a spendthrift.''   ``Slander was infectious,'' Byrd says.   This year's 101st Congress opened with a donnybrook over aproposed large congressional pay raise.   Old hat, says Byrd.   Pay squabbles date to the first Congress and began in earnest in1816 when it was proposed that the pay rate of $6 a day be changedto a $1,500 a year.   The result: Public Outrage.   The further result, according to Byrd: ``In the next electiontwo-thirds of the members of the House were defeated. Severalsenators were also defeated and some resigned rather than stand forre-election.''   Also this year, the Senate tied itself into emotional knots overPresident's Bush's nomination of former Sen. John Tower of Texas tobe secretary of defense, a battle that led to Tower's defeat.   Nothing new in that, says Byrd.   On a March day in 1843, President John Tyler's nomination ofRep. Caleb Cushing of Massachusetts to be secretary of the Treasurywas rejected three times in three roll call votes on a single day.   The Senate was in a nasty mood that day. It twice rejectedTyler's nomination of Rep. Henry Wise of Virginia to be minister toFrance and defeated his nominees to head the navy and wardepartments and scuttled his nominee as minister to Brazil.   To top things off, the Senate rejected Tyler's nomination ofJohn Spence for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Bush's experience with the Tower nomination can't compare tothat, Byrd says.   Byrd said he hopes his history, which is available from theGovernment Printing Office, will be a contribution to theinstitutional memory of the place.   ``Nothing has changed in 200 years,'' Byrd said. ``The Senate isstill guided by the Constitution and the knowledge that everythingthat comes before it is just a new set of circumstances come tocenter stage.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Lawrence L.
