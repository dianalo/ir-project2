James McCulla, director of media services for the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration, said in a speech thatfollowing the Jan. 28, 1986 Challenger explosion, there were ordersfrom agency administrators that no one was to talk to the mediaabout the possible causes of the accident.   ``This caused some of our NASA people to desert their usualopenness with the press,'' said McCulla. ``You had a massiveclam-up, like never before. Our reputation with the mass media washurt.''   He said there were stories alleging that NASA was attempting tocover up the causes of the Challenger accident and there arose afeeling of mistrust toward NASA.   Before the accident, he said, NASA enjoyed the reputation of a``Mission Impossible'' organization, an agency that could tacklethe difficult assignments and accomplish success because it had``the best and the brightest'' engineers and leadership.   But after Challenger exploded and killed seven crew members, theagency came under close scrutiny of the press, a presidentialcommission and Congress, and ``you could see how the image (ofexcellence) disintingrated,'' McCulla said.   Some scientists and engineers in the agency were confused by themedia spotlight and resented the criticism, he said. Some of thetechnical leaders were proud of the job NASA had done in the Apollolunar program and the agency's other accomplishments, he said, and``they couldn't understand why it (NASA) was being torn down andraked over the coals'' after the accident.   With NASA now in the final stages of preparation for returningthe shuttle fleet to flight, McCulla said the era of what he called``NASA bashing'' news stories is over.   ``The stories now look toward the future,'' he said.   McCulla said the space agency has not abandoned its plans to flyordinary citizens in space. One of the seven who died aboardChallenger was Christa McAuliffe, a Concord, N.H. school teacherwho had been selected as the first to fly in the citizen-in-spaceprogram.   NASA public relations leaders ``fought hard'' for that program,McCulla said, and there still are plans to fly a teacher in thefuture, but not until there is ``total confidence'' restored in thespace shuttle.   ``After we've got that sort of confidence, the teacher will gofor a ride,'' he said. ``How far down the road that will be, Idon't know.''</TEXT></DOC>
