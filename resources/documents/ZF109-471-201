 For example, to get the nice graphics and layouts functionsoffered by Aldus PageMaker or Quark Xpress, it generally has been necessaryto sacrifice some of the typographic functions professional users have takenfor granted.andM;Another area in which compromises have been necessary is in copy routing inmultiuser environments.andP;  Most of the desktop products were designed forsingle-user operation, almost ignoring all questions of how users interactwhen different people want to do different parts of a job.andM;These concerns were in our minds recently when we came across a magazinepublisher that is beginning to replace an Atex system with more than 400 PCsrunning XyWrite, with Quark Xpress used for handamp;j and page layout.andO;Interestingly, this publisher hasn't found it necessary to make anysignificant changes to the copyflow procedures it has been using with its Atesystem.andM;The issue of cipy routing is an important part of the story we are presentingin this article.andP;  But there are other, more obvious, issues.andP;  One is thelinking of Xywrite with Xpress--the products that are fast becoming thefavored mass-market word processing and page layout &quot;engines&quot; forprofessional use.andP;  Another is the facility for flowing text into a desktoplayout program as a bath process, rather than having to work manually onevery frame or every story, as is usually the case.andM;Our article, which appears in two parts, centers on three Quark Xtensionsfrom North Atlantic Publishing Systems.andP;  They have been demonstrated andwritten about previously (North Atlantic appeared at this year's ANPA show),but not in great depth.andP;  The user we mentioned, which is just now going intolive production, has demonstrated some things we hadn't seen before.andP;  We wereso interested in the product philosophy, the user's strategy and thepreliminary results from their cooperation that we thought it would be worthdevoting an article to it.andM;North AtlanticandM;North Atlantic Publishing Systems, founded by previous Atex softwareengineers, has three new products on the market, all based on QuarkXtensions: CopyFlow, CopyFlow Reports and CopyBridge.andM;CopyFlow, the company's initial product, announced more than a year ago, hasa primary purpose of simplifying the collection of text and art elemetns on apage and flowing these elements onto Xpress pages as a batch process.andP;  Itwill work page by page or flow copy into an entire document skeleton(layout).andM;CoypFlow Reports is a simple report generator developed to report on thestatus of the copy flow procedure.andP;  It produces one of two types ofreports--an ASCII file or a printed layout--both showing the results offlowing copy into Xpress layouts.andM;CopyBridge was developed to &quot;optimally integrate the editorial power ofXyWrite and the page layout strenths of Quark.&quot;andP;  In effect, it communicatestypographic and copyfitting information between XyWrited editors working onPCs and layout editors building complete pages using Quark Xpress.andP;  We foundthe product's flexibility usedful in bridging the gap between traditionalback-end pagination, where the entire page is built and copy is edited to fitat the pagination terminal, and the front-end approach to pagination, wherealmost all copyfitting is done (and a considerable amount of typographicmarkup is specified) on front-end editorial terminals.andM;CopyFlowandM;CopyFlow, North Atlantic's base product, is the foundation for both CopyFlowReports and CopyBridge.andP;  As we mentioned above, it is an Xtension to QuarkXpress, intended to facilitate the marriage of the text writing and editingphase of a publication with the layout and final makeup of a document.andP;  As weused the product to get more familiar with its features and functions, itbecame apparent that it is well suited across a broad range of applications:catalog work, books, magazines and newspapers.andP;  Essentially, it will workwell in any environment where Xpress is a suitable layout/makeup program andthe writing and editing of text is primarily relegated to a front-end wordprocessor (or full editorial system).andP;  Its primary goal is to simplify theprepress publishing task in workgroup publishing environments.andM;Batch processing.andP;  In most of the popular page or document makeup programs(such as PageMaker, Ventura and the standard Xpress program), the user canimport (and export files in a variety of standard word processor formats.andO;But this is usually done one story at a time as the user &quot;places&quot; the stories(or graphic objects and pictures) directly onto the page--identifying theformat of the incoming object as it is placed.andP;  Worse than that, if extensiverevisions are made to the various pieces of copy, the entire publicationoften has to be reflowed (one story or object at a time) back into theoriginal layout--a time-consuming process.andM;With CopyFlow, the end result is the same--but the process can be done in abatch mode to simplify and speed up this process greatly.andP;  The flexibility ofthe program also makes it possible to provide alternative copyflow scenariosto enable the front end to work more independently and to enable fitting copyto predesigned document or page layouts.andM;Using CopyFlowandM;CopyFlow follows the same initial steps that most Xpress users follow--withthe exception of the placement of text and graphic elements onto pages.andP;  Theusers begins by laying out an entire page or set of pages within a multipagedocument, book, magazine or newspaper section.andP;  A box or multiple boxes aredrawn for each story, headline, cutline and graphic element to be importedonto the pages.andP;  Created graphics are generated directly using the standardXpress tool set.andM;Naming elements.andP;  The next step is what makes the Xtension a significantenhancement over standard Xpress features.andP;  CopyFlow alows the user to &quot;name&quot;each of the boxes just created.andP;  A popup dialog box appears for the user tofill in the name of each box as the layout is created.andP;  As you would expect,the key is matching these names to the names of stories that have alreadybeen written on a front-end system, are in the process of being written oredited on a front-end system, or are planned to be written.andM;Stories already written and sent to Xpress for placement are listed inaspecial popup directory to facilitate the naming process.andP;  For those storiesnot already sent to Xpress, the user simply types the appropriate name.andM;The same is true for art and graphic objects that are prescanned or createdand stored somewhere in the system.andP;  After space is assigned for each graphicelement, the space reservation box is &quot;named.&quot;andP;  The system uses a warningmessage to protect against the same name being assigned to more than one box.andM;System aspects.andP;  CopyFlow is clearly aimed at the multiuser environment,although nothing prevents it from being used as a standalone Mac product.andO;However, it was designed to work as part of a network where the layoutprocess is independent of the copy entry and editing task.andM;As we will see with the follow-on product, CopyBridge, it is also optimizedfor XyWrite and therefore works well with writers and editors working on PCswhile layout and makeup artists work on Macs using Xpress.andP;  This presumes anetwork and file server.andP;  However, the Xtension itself (North Atlantic'sprogram) is independent of the particular network and should have nodifficulty working with any network that can successfully accommodate XyWriteand Xpress.andM;Status indicators.andP;  We were a bit surprised to see that assigned names werenot immediately shown in their respective boxes on the layout--not a criticalflaw, but one we would like to see addressed.andP;  We think it would be helpfulat all times to see which stories (and graphic elemetns) have been assignedto reservations in the Xpress layout.andP;  North Atlantic does provide some helpin this area by providing a &quot;floating palette&quot; that shows the name of thetext or graphic element assigned to any selected box, but not to other boxesdisplayed on the page.andM;In addition, CopyFlow displays the name of the editor or artist associatedwith this element (specified during the naming process, as described below)and the path names of the document's import and export folders.andP;  (More onthis latter.)andM;Other information provided during the &quot;name box&quot; procedure is helpful laterin the process when status reports are generated.andP;  While naming a story orpiece of artwork, the layout artist/editor can (by typing into a dialog box)associate an editor's or artist's name with this element.andP;  In a later releaseof the product, this process will be automated--capturing logon IDs ofXyWrite stories.andM;Names can be applied to any box of a chained Xpress link.andP;  The name isapplied to all boxes of the linked chain.andP;  As a result of the naming process,the system will also fill in the dialog box with the total depth of the box(or chain of boxes) based on default units (picas and points, etc.).andM;Importing and exportingandM;Once the layout is completed and each space reservation (empty layout box)has been named, the system is ready for the automatic flowing of stories andgraphic elements onto pages of the document, in the locations (boxes) thatmatch their names.andP;  Flowing is accomplished using what North Atlantic refersto as an &quot;import folder.&quot;andP;  This is a standard Mac folder containing all theelements that are to be flowed automatically into the document.andP;  Writers,editors and graphic artists must send their final components to this folder.andM;The degree of automation in routing files to this folder is likely to differfrom system to system, since the routing process is completely independent ofNorth Atlantic's CopyFlow software.andP;  This clearly points out the need forcopy routing and database management--even at the desktop level.andM;The import folder can be located anywhere on the system--including the diskfrom which Xpress is being loaded or, most likely, the system's file server.andO;The appropriate folder to be used with the Xpress document currently open isselected from the filing system using an &quot;open file&quot; dialog provided by theCopyFlow program.andP;  If no import folder is selected, the system assumes theuser wants the same folder where Xpress resides.andM;The same procedure is used to select the &quot;export folder&quot; that tells thesystem where to put all text files extracted from Xpress documents when theyare sent back to their front-end systems.andM;Translating imported files.andP;  When copy is imported as a batch routine fromthe import folder, a couple of things happen to it.andP;  First, its character setand word processing format and character attributes are automaticallytranslated (filtered) into a common format that Xpress understands.andP;  ForXyWrite users, this means that five of the eight modes (those pertainingprimarily to character attributes such as bold and italic) are automaticallytranslated into Xpress character styles.andP;  Optionally, there is also a nicefeature to convert inch marks into begin and end typesetter quotes.andM;CopyFlow performs the translation process (and the selection of theappropriate translation filter) automatically by detecting the file typedesignator or the file extension of the incoming text.andP;  This indicates whichword processing system the copy originated in.andM;Quark supports several standard word processing translation filters and moreare being added all the time.andP;  The user also can add his own translationfilter to the system for less common word processors.andM;Styles.andP;  In addition to standard word processing filtering, files can containstyle tags (similar to format calls), allowing the user to specify a simpledesignator such as &quot;body text&quot; to invoke a group of typographic parameters atthis point (such as point size, font and leading).andM;The user can choose either of two sets of style tags that can be appliedautomatically to imported text.andP;  The two types are similar, but notidentical.andP;  One set is the standard &quot;Quark Extended Style Tag.&quot;andP;  The secondis a set provided by North Atlantic, called &quot;NAPS Style Tags.&quot;andP;  When the usersets up his system for importing text, he sets the default (preference)settings for one or the other.andP;  At the same time, he can set up the defaultfile format for exported text.andP;  (More on these options later.)andM;Exporting.andP;  Exporting files works just like the import process.andP;  The userpre-designates a folder into which all text files (currently not art files)will be sent when the &quot;batch export&quot; task is run.andP;  Since most of the Xpressfilters work bidirectionally, the copy is translated back into a format ofthe front end or word processor (the one from which the text was translatedupon input).andM;The system also retains any Xpress commands within the file that aren'trecognizable by the word processor (a feature also used by VenturaPublisher).andP;  In this way, after revisions are made on the front-end wordprocessor and reimported into Xpress, all of the original markup isreapplied.andP;  Picture position and scaling commands can also be kept within theXpress file, so that when low-resolution files are later replaced with morefinished (high-resolution) photos, the same position and scaling parameterscan automatically be applied.andM;Optionally, the user can select a single format (such as XyWrite) into whichall exported copy is to be translated.andP;  Why?andP;  This is significant advantagewhen the imported copy may originate from many outside sources--in a varietyof word processing formats--but when all editing will be done in-house usinga single word processing package.andM;It also is possible to override export preference during batch exporting.andO;The user can select any loaded translation filter--MacWrite II, Word 4.0,etc.--or the native format, which will export text to its source file type(MacWrite, etc.) as a single batch operation.andM;Options.andP;  There are a few options for importing and exporting text, besidesthe Style Tag selection mentioned above.andP;  The user can import or export anentire document as a single &quot;tagged&quot; file.andP;  In NAPS language, this means thatall the text files can be embedded within a single file with delimitersdenoting the names representing the different box locations within thelayout, into which copy is imported or from which it is exported.andM;For example, a user can import (and export) a story, its headline, storycaption(s) and other related components as a single file.andP;  Within the fileswill be delimiters and component names that tell Xpress into which layoutboxes to flow the copy.andM;Another option allows the user to select individually only those layout boxesthat are to be filled or exported from.andP;  Other utilities--such as batchflushing the page (removing all the contents, but not the layout iself)--areprovided.andP;  And the user can import text or art files individually uponrequest.andM;There is also a convenient &quot;find box&quot; selection that allows the user toselect a box and have the system find and highlight it.andP;  This is obviouslynot too important when the Xpress layout is only a single page, but it couldprove helpful for lengthy documents.andM;CopyFlow ReportsandM;CopyFlow Reports is a closely related Xtension that produces reportsregarding copy flowed onto Xpress pages using CopyFlow.andP;  Two types of reportsare offered: ASCII text reports and graphic layout reports.andM;ASCII reports.andP;  The first type of report is in the form of an ASCII file.andP;  Inessence, it is a status report produced for any Quark Xpress document.andP;  Thisfile can be imported into a Xpress document, a word processing program or adatabase management system.andP;  It can therefore be viewed on the screen orprinted in hard-copy form.andP;  As we will discuss in a moment, the report canalso be sent to another system or program to help manage or track the statusof a publication.andM;Eight fixed fields are available in the reports.andP;  These include the pagenumbers, the Xpress box name, the editor or artist name (assigned duringlayout), the data of the last batch revision, the size of the box (text newshole or size of a graphic element), the box type (text or art) copyfitinformation (the number of lines in the box and the amount of overset copy,if any, or, for art, if the art box has been filled or is empty), the filetype (the type of word processor that created the copy, or, for artwork, thefile format [TIFF, etc.]).andM;The user can select any or all of these fields to be included in the reportfrom a simple popup menu.andP;  the order in which the fields are selecteddetermines the order in which they appear in the report.andP;  The user also hasthe option to include or exclude column headings.andP;  One last option that willbe helpful if the report is imported into other programs is the ability toselect a &quot;field separator.&quot;andP;  Field separators can be tab characters, commas,semicolons or colons.andM;Essentially, the report gives a quick snapshot of the status of any page,section or document (depending on how the entire publication has been brokenup).andP;  For each page, it will show what elements have been placed onto thepage, which ones need editing to fit (overset indicators) and what other artelements are missing.andM;This report responds to the many large publications that have been crying forbasic status reports about publications.andP;  They want to know at any givenpoint the status of the publication: how many pages are complete, how manyneed work, what elements are missing, etc.andM;We doubt that many of the larger newspaper that have been requesting thisinformation (longer than most other types of publications) could use thisprogram by themselves to solve their page-tracking problems.andP;  But in thehands of a system integrator that can add the glue to tie this togeter withthe systems that provide the page elements (editorial systems, display adsystems and graphic subsystems), there may be a solution at hand.andP;  Add adatabase and you may have the basics of the tracking mechanism you may haveonce considered paying millions to get.andM;CopyFlow layouts.andP;  The second type of reports is in the form of adiagrammatic layout.andP;  The program replicates the Xpress pages (as layouts) inreduced size, showing two pages per printed report.andP;  Text boxes of the layoutare shown as white boxes; art boxes are shaded gray.andP;  The report can alsodisplay art boxes as screen-resolution versions of the actual art.andP;  If textor art boxes have been named, the names are printed within the boxes.andP;  Linkedtext boxes are also denoted with printed link numbers.andM;For layout reports, the selection process is by page number.andP;  The user simplyselects the rnage of pages to be included in the report and how the pictureboxes are to be represented (grayed or low-resolution pictures).andM;CopyBridgeandM;This third Quark Xtension from NAPS is dedicated to XyWrite users--to couplenetworked XyWrite to Quark Xpress.andP;  It takes CopyFlow one large step forwardto enable XyWrite users to tie the writing and editing functions togethermore intimately with layout and makeup.andP;  It provides a stronger, two-way,integrated link between XyWrite and Xpress to pass more comprehensive markupand size information (copyfit data) between the two systems.andM;Copywrite attempts to link two very different systems.andP;  The differences arein respect to typographical formatting of text.andP;  One of the biggest gripes wehave heard for a long time is the limitation that Xpress allows style of tagsto be applied only on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis.andP;  If you need to make achange within a paragraph, it isn't easy with Xpress.andP;  XyWrite, on the otherhand, in a blind markup mode, allows the user to enter styles anywhere--asmany as you like within individual paragraphs.andM;There are also many other differences.andP;  The goal of CopyBridge was tominimize the tradeoffs so that users could take advantage of the strengths ofboth systems and avoid having to make significant compromises.andM;In general, CopyBridge adheres to the concept of separation of form andcontent.andP;  It tries to give XyWrite users the power they need to write andedit (and to fit copy to predetermined geometric layouts), together withbasic copy formatting (such as type size changes, font calls and emphasis inmarkup [bold, italic, etc.]).andP;  It leaves the heavy markup task to Xpress.andM;In conjunction with flowing copy, CopyBridge simplifies the copy revisionprocess, at least in cases in which the layouts haven't changed.andP;  Batchreflowing of text back into layouts puts the burden of text revisions whereit belongs--in the hands of copy editors, not layout people.andP;  The programeliminates the remaking of pages because of text revisions.andM;Formatting is handled with a matching of XyWrite styles to Xpressstylesheets.andP;  For each XyWrite style, there must be a corresponding Xpressstyle.andP;  These are created and maintained like any other XyWrite and Xpressstyle on their respective systems.andP;  In addition, XyWrite modes are translatedinto Xpress character attributes.andM;One problem that has been resolved with CopyBridge is that XyWrite stylechanges in mid-paragraph are implemented on the Xpress side for alltypographic changes that Xpress will allow within a paragraph--point sizes,font changes, tracking, etc.andP;  Any of these typographic changes that occur inmid-paragraph are translated back into WyWrite style commands when thesefiles are exported from Xpress back to XyWrite.andM;Copyfit.andP;  In addition to a tighter coupling of formatting and typographicinformation.andP;  CopyBridge provides more information to the XyWrite userregarding the fit of copy to the designated Xpress layout.andP;  When copy isflowed onto Xpress pages using CopyFlow and exported back to XyWrite, NAPSinserted copyfit comments directly into the XyWrite files (in XyWrite's notemode).andP;  The system indicates whether the copy fits the news hole or if it isunderset, in which case it tells the number of lines underset and showsexactly where in the text the condition occurs.andP;  This gives writers andeditors (on their PCs) a clear view of how their copy fits with respect topredermined Xpress layouts.andM;CopyBridge goes beyond that function too.andP;  Soft line breaks (resulting fromhandamp;j within Xpress) are sent within the text file as the XyWrite alternateline-end character.andP;  Paragraph ends are terminated with carriage returns.andO;Hyphens inserted by Xpress handamp;j are inserted (and will be strippedautomatically upon reflowing into Xpress).andP;  Even loose lines are flagged byXpress and shown as flashing bold comments when viewed on the XyWrite screen.andO;All of these Xpress commands can be made invisible to XyWrite users as well,with a simple option pick.andM;CopyBridge provides an enhancement regarding XyWrite mode settings, that goesbeyond that provided in CopyFlow.andP;  A simple popup menu allows the user tospecify a NAPS style tag (a format that will be applied during composition)for each of seven XyWrite modes (all but notes mode, since this is reservedfor messaging between the two systems).andP;  Any set of composition parameterscan therefore be automatically applied to text that enters the system in oneof the seven standard XyWrite modes.andP;  These settings are &quot;system defaults&quot;and are not unique for each document or carried along with each document.andO;Therefore, they are normally set up once for each customer site.andM;Hot input folders!andP;  Another benefit of CopyBridge is its ability to offerXpress handamp;j to XyWrite on PCs.andP;  In other words, when writers using XyWrite onPCs want an automatic indication of how their copy will fit Xpress newsholes, CopyBridge can provide them with an autmatic batch handamp;j andcopy-routing process that comes close to acting as if Xpress handamp;j were runningdirectly within XyWrite.andM;This function is accomplished by using a batch handamp;j process and an automaticrouting scheme where copy flows from folder to folder, based on predeterminedsetup conditions, including those established for standard CopyFlow.andM;CopyFlow can pull copy from a designated import folder automatically, florthe copy (via Xpress handamp;j) into named news holes in a document (or page)layout, and automatically route the resulting copy (reflecting fitinformation and line-break data) to another folder (the export folder).andP;  Theconcept of &quot;hot folders&quot; adds to this scenario another level of automaticcopy routing and batch copy flowing.andM;Hot folders automate the process of batch flowing of copy from the importfolder into an Xpress document.andP;  By establishing what NAPS refers to as a hotfolder, the user tells the system to monitor this folder for any files sentto it from XyWrite users.andP;  When it detects a story in the hot folder, itexamines the top of the file for the name of the document (Xpress layout) towhich it belongs.andP;  (There isn't any special header associated with thesefiles, just a simple name at the beginning of the file, typed in XyWrite'snotes mode).andP;  The system automatically opens this document (layout) andtransfers the story from the hot folder to the designated import folder forthe document.andP;  Then, as with any manually flowed copy, the story is handamp;j'edagainst the Xpress layout and eventually exported to the document'sdesignated export folder.andP;  From here the XyWrite user can manually call thecomposed story and review it for copyfit (against the actual layout), withline breaks, loose lines and copyfit designators indicated within the file.andM;So, in essence, CopyBridge provides an automatic way of handamp;j'ing XyWrite filesagainst Xpress layouts, using Xpress handamp;j, and automating, to a large extent,copy routing and the handamp;j process itself.andP;  The only operation not fullyautomated (beyond a simple, self-contained, single-keystroke handamp;j processwithin XyWrite) is the manual routing and recalling of files to and from theMac folders.andP;  Short of this (and the slight delay incurred in the process),it is very simplified and exact handamp;j process for operations that favor thephilosophy of separation of form and content and insist on exact copyfittingby the writer/editor on a front-end PC.andM;This system goes a long way in addressing the needs of many publications thatfollow this approach (as opposed to those that are satisfied with copyfittingat the layout/makeup station).andP;  It solves one of the long-term problems withwhich we have been wrestling: that of different composition routines forfront-end pagination.andP;  But compared to other solutions that have addressedthis problem by requiring that the front-end editing system (actually itscomposition) and the page makeup/layout system be supplied by the samevendor, this approach is considerably more flexible (and obviously morecost-effective).andM;Now that we have broken the barrier of one composition package being sharedby two different systems, it will be interesting to see how far this approachcan be pushed in three distinct areas:andM;* Flexibility.andP;  What other front ends can be combined with different layoutpackages?andM;* Automation.andP;  What degree of automation is possible (eliminating even themanual routing to specific hot folders)?andM;* Size.andP;  Can it work productively (quickly) in larger configurations)?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
