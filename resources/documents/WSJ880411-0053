Net Worth Was Negative in '87 --- Airline Also Projected Loss For 1st Period and Noted Cash Problem, in Filing </HL><AUTHOR> Teri Agins (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR PN </CO><IN> AIR </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pan Am Corp. reported a worsened negative net worth and rising debt at the end 1987, and said that its cash position sank further in February, which is in the midst of its slow winter season. As expected, the airline holding company also predicted a first-quarter loss.    In its 1987 annual report, which includes its Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K filing, Pan Am said that last year's $265.3 million net loss reduced its net worth to a negative $245 million at the end of December, compared with a positive net worth of $8.8 million a year earlier. The net worth figure -- assets minus liabilities -- has been in the red since the end of last year's first quarter when it stood at a negative $82 million.    As of Dec. 31, the airline's total debt had risen to $1.1 billion from $895 million a year earlier. Long-term debt increased to $992 million from $827 million for 1986. In addition, Pan Am has $565 million in unfunded pension liabilities that aren't on its balance sheet.    The airline also disclosed that it had only $123.9 million in cash at the end of February -- the lowest amount of cash on hand it has had in recent years. At the end of December 1987, Pan Am had $250 million in cash on hand. A spokesman, however, said the $123.9 million figure had since climbed to $150 million. &quot;Cash is rebuilding,&quot; as the company's principal unit, Pan American World Airways, enters the summer travel season, he said.    Further weakening in its cash position could be critical for Pan Am as it has little borrowing capacity. In its filing, the airline said it has &quot;encumbered substantially all of (its) assets, eliminating secured financing as a source of funds,&quot; adding that &quot;except for certain small overdraft facilities&quot; the company doesn't have any bank credit facilities.    Pan Am acknowledges that it faces another precarious year. But Peter T. McHugh, Pan Am's senior vice president in marketing said last week that trans-atlantic summer bookings are running about 20% above the 1987 level.    The prospective improvement &quot;will give them another summer to survive, but it will be nip and tuck as far as I can see,&quot; said Raymond Neidl, a securities analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei. Robert Joedicke of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. called it a &quot;make-it-or-break-it summer.&quot;    Wall Street analysts expect that Pan Am, which has accumulated $2.4 billion of operating losses in the past eight years, will report first-quarter losses of between $75 million and $95 million. The airline would neither confirm nor deny that estimate of the loss.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pan Am closed at $2.75, down 12.5 cents.    In his letter to shareholders, Thomas G. Plaskett, Pan Am's newly elected chairman and chief executive officer, said that lenders and investors are unwilling to back Pan Am until &quot;the company can demonstrate a sound operating plan.&quot; Mr. Plaskett added: &quot;There can be no assurances that our progress toward recovery will be immediately visible or effective.&quot; He has spent his first two months on the job developing strategies to increase the airline's capacity by 15% and add more domestic routes to feed into Pan Am's international flights.    Meanwhile, the airline has yet to realize all of the $180 million in labor cost concessions that it has been seeking from its unions. So far $118 million of the concessions are in effect. These came from the pilots and flight engineers who agreed to cuts, and from Teamsters, who threatened to strike but are working under company imposed cuts. However, Pan Am still hasn't obtained the concessions of $35 million from flight attendants and $27 million from mechanics and others in the Transport Workers Union that it seeks.    The Transport Workers are still negotiating with Pan Am, though flight attendants are now voting on the proposed cuts. In a recent letter, Mr. Plaskett warned the flight attendants that &quot;radical changes are in store&quot; if the negotiated settlements aren't ratified. Pan Am will &quot;look to other areas such as major restructuring, sales of routes and other assets, all of which will put jobs in jeopardy,&quot; he wrote. Such alternative plans, he added, &quot;will be more Draconian than anything that we have ever seen.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
