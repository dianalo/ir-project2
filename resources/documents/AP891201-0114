WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The East German Parliament abolished theCommunist Party's constitutional guarantee of supremacy on Friday,as pro-democracy groups had demanded, reflecting a national feverfor swift and thorough reform.   The 500-member People's Chamber named a commission toinvestigate abuse of office. Commission chairman Heinrich Toeplitzrevealed details of personal enrichment by the elite before ErichHonecker was forced out as party chief in October.   Deputies gasped and shook their heads in disgust when Toeplitzsaid Honecker and other ousted leaders put $54 billion in Swissbank accounts and spent huge sums on hunting lodges, luxuryvacation homes and other indulgences.   Many lawmakers shouted for justice and compensation. DeputyWolfgang Reinhold called the abuses ``degenerate'' behavior thatshould be punished.   East Germany became the second Soviet bloc nation this week toabolish the Communist monopoly on power. Czechoslovakia'sparliament did it Wednesday.   Earlier this year, Poland named its first non-Communistgovernment since World War II and Hungary's Communist Partytransformed itself into a Social Democratic party. Bulgaria alsomoved toward reforms.   While Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's liberalization hasled to looser Soviet control over allies, there is no indicationthe Communists are ready to relinquish their hold on power in theKremlin.   The official East German news agency ADN said the 163-memberCentral Committee would meet Sunday. It could decide to expelHonecker and other members of the former leadership.   Former economic chief Guenter Mittag already has been expelledin the party's effort to win public favor.   Egon Krenz, who replaced Honecker as party leader, told deputiesFriday the Communist Party was responsible for the nation's severeeconomic problems and the excesses.   ``Gross political errors have been committed by my party,''Krenz told the session, which was carried live on state television.``As leader of the Politburo and the Central Committee, I takeresponsibility for this.''   ``Such behavior will never be repeated.''   Krenz, 52, faces growing challenges from both the opposition andthe party because of his long association with the hard-lineHonecker regime.   The city council of Plauen called for Krenz's resignation overhis alleged role in faking the results of municipal elections thissummer that gave the Communists an overwhelming majority.   Parliament, long a rubber-stamp body that translated CommunistParty policy into law, had been scheduled to devote Friday'ssession to discussion of new regulations on foreign travel.   But non-Communist parliament speaker Guenther Maleuda opened thesession by saying the leaders of all parties represented in thePeople's Chamber jointly proposed a constitutional revision tostrip the Communists of their guaranteed leading role.   Without debate, a show of hands was called on the motion to dropa passage from Article 1 describing East Germany as ``underleadership of the working class and its Marxist-Leninist party.''   The Communist-dominated chamber broke out into applause afterall but five of the 420 deputies present voted in favor of strikingthe Communist power monopoly from the constitution. The fiveabstained.   ``This is the best we could have wished for,'' said Carla Kawaltof the leading opposition group, New Forum, when told of thedecision. ``We are very happy with this action.''   She said the constitutional change was necessary to give otherpolitical groups more influence in national affairs. She declined,however, to characterize the move as a sign the Communistleadership is committed to democratic principles.   New Forum activists in Karl-Marx-Stadt called for a two-hourstrike for Wednesday, demanding further reforms such as amarket-oriented economy. National New Forum leader Baerbel Bohleyresisted the call but said she supported the demands.   Members of the Christian Democratic Union, which like all of theparties in parliament traditionally has voted along with theCommunists, suggested the designation of East Germany as ``asocialist state'' also be stricken from the constitution. But thatproposal failed to win the two-thirds majority needed forconstitutional changes, drawing only 112 ``yes'' votes and 20abstentions.   The amended article describes East Germany as a ``socialiststate of workers and farmers.''   East Germans repeatedly have called for an end to Communistdomination during the street protests that have swept the nationfor two months.   But even among pro-democracy activists, many voices recentlyhave called for keeping the nation's socialist foundation to staveoff the reunification aims of West Germany.   Many East Germans fear that their small nation of 16.5 millionwould lose its identity in a confederation or in a union with thewealthy West German state that has more than 61 million people andis one of the world's strongest economies.   The Communists retain control of the government, but the changeapproved Friday paves the way for a more competitive politicalsystem for the next national elections, expected as early as nextyear.   The legislature also passed a resolution that said East Germanyregretted its participation in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion ofCzechoslovakia that crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms. Theresolution apologized to the people of Czechoslovakia and expressedsolidarity with its reforms.   Special committees also were named to draft a law on freeelections and to consider further constitutional change.   Deputies also heard warnings from Premier Hans Modrow, PlanningMinister Gerhard Schuerer and others that a long road lies ahead toeconomic recovery.   Trade Minister Manfred Flegel said the hoarding of high-pricedgoods such as appliances and electronics has skyrocketed ascitizens have become fearful about the value of their currency,which is non-convertible and is worth little outside East Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
