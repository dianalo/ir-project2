Kelly, former chairman of Beatrice Co.and a near-legendary dealmaker, has formed a new limited partnershipdesigned to acquire businesses that can be bought for as much as $1billion.   The investment firm Salomon Inc. will be a permanent partner toD.P. Kelly andamp; Associates, arranging financing and finding investorsfor Kelly's new pursuits, Kelly said Tuesday.   ``We provide the managerial skills,'' Kelly said. ``We don't haveto worry about where we're going to get the equity. They (Salomon)find it. ... We aren't involved with all the transactions they'lldo, but they'll be involved with everything we do.''   Kelly said he wants to start another conglomerate from scratch,as he did with Swift meats in the late 1970s and early 1980s.   He renamed the company Esmark as it acquired and sold offcompanies ranging from personal care to industrial products to foodand automotive products.   Esmark was acquired by Chicago-based Beatrice in 1984.   Less than two years later, Kelly acquired Beatrice in a $6.2billion leveraged buyout backed by a New York investment firm,Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   The deal, the largest of its kind at the time, was financed byselling off almost all of the food conglomerate's businesses.   Kelly said he left Beatrice because he ran out of things to do.   ``There were no major acquisitions or dispositions to do and forthem to pay me the kind of money they were to sit in my office wasridiculous,'' he said.   Kohlberg Kravis recently acquired RJR Nabisco in a $25 billionleveraged buyout.   Kelly said his plans are much more modest, but that Kelly andamp;Associates might be interested in smaller businesses RJR may spinoff after that sale is completed.   ``We now happen to believe there are areas below the multibilliondeal where we can build a company not too dissimilar to what Esmarkdid, and not too dissimilar to what Beatrice was,'' Kelly said.   ``I would say we're looking for acquisitions in the $50 millionto $500 million range without any problem, but we're probably skewedmore toward the $1 billion deal.''   Kelly, 66, retired as Beatrice's chairman in August, though hestill sits on the board of directors.   He has worked on deals with Salomon for 25 years, but said thenew partnership ``is not going to be a single transaction type ofrelationship'' like his reportedly stormy one with Kohlberg Kravisat Beatrice.</TEXT></DOC>
