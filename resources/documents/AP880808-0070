Aboard Air Force II, on his way to New Orleans from his Mainehome in Kennebunkport, Bush also suggested there still may be achance that he and President Reagan will appear together at theRepublican National Convention next week.   Previously announced plans called for Reagan to leave NewOrleans before Bush returns next Tuesday. However, the vicepresident told reporters that he would view such a joint appearanceas a plus for his campaign.   Bush attacked Dukakis as ``unexperienced'' and therefore a riskybet as president in remarks Sunday. Dukakis' campaign counteredthat Bush's lengthy government ``resume didn't help him when itmattered.''   Reagan spoke in Cincinnati today to the National GovernorsAssociation, declaring, ``While Washington has been caught up inpartisan intrigue, you've gone out and done the job.''   In his remarks prepared for delivery to the governors, Reagannever mentioned the presidential campaign. He said that during histwo terms in the White House he had kept his promise to ``get thefederal government off the backs of the states.''   Bush, in remarks prepared for his unusual appearance before theRepublican Platform Committee today, called Dukakis ``the stealthcandidate.''   ``For while he can't decide about the stealth bomber, he favorsinstead stealth policies _ they can be neither seen nor heard. Hiscampaign jets from place to place, but no issues show up on theradar screen.''   Bush called the Democratic platform a ``document of deceit'' andurged GOP drafters to be more specific.   ``We need to make this campaign a plan for the future, astatement of solutions, not an exercise in evasion,'' he said. ``Weshould make our principles and our policies crystal clear to theAmerican people.''   Bush also was to tour the Superdome where he will be nominatednext week.   The GOP platform, free of controversy within the party, willhighlight differences with the Democrats.   ``I think the country is entitled to know the specifics,'' Bushsaid Sunday after going to church near his home in Kennebunkport,Maine. ``The governor of Massachusetts says he is a liberal, sayshe is a card-carrying member of the ACLU (the American CivilLiberties Union), and that didn't come out of the convention.''   Bush even added new heat to his attacks on Dukakis' foreignpolicy experience.   ``We can't risk the peace and national security of this countryon someone as unexperienced as the governor of Massachusetts,'' theGOP nominee-to-be said.   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich responded by saying Bushsupported arms sales to the Iranians in the Iran-Contra affair.   ``The vice president's resume didn't help him when itmattered,'' she said. ``He sat silently by while the administrationpeddled arms to the Ayatollah.''   Presidential politics was the topic in private discussions atthe National Governors' Association meeting, where Dukakis was tospeak on Tuesday. But the chief executives agreed to avoid publicpartisanship.   Republican Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire, a vigorous Dukakiscritic, promised Sunday to keep the campaign out of the meeting.   Dukakis, just returned from a three-day campaign swing, needledBush for not accepting a debate plan put forth by the two politicalparties. The GOP nominee-to-be said the question was not whether todebate, but when and who will sponsor the confrontations that havebecome a staple of presidential campaigns.   ``There'll be more than one debate, but how many ... has notbeen sorted out yet,'' Bush said. ``Not only do I want debates, butI have to because I've got to get him to stand by his record.''   The Democratic campaign is ready to talk debate specifics, butBush has said those conversations cannot begin until he formallybecomes the Republican nominee at next week's convention.   Bush ``is talking tough to the cameras but is refusing to meetMike Dukakis in a face-to-face debate,'' Estrich said. ``If GeorgeBush wants to debate foreign policy, Mike Dukakis is ready.''   Bush, with a unified party behind him but trailing badly in thepolls, moved today to take the spotlight for the next two weeks,coming to the Republicans' convention city seven days before theopening gavel to talk to the platform committee.   The Democrats have ``had their day in sun,'' he said. ``Now wewill have our day.''   Bush vowed to draw distinctions with the Democrats and theirshort platform that spoke of themes and goals and mentioned fewspecific programs.   ``They masked it. They cramped down any discussion of individualinitiatives,'' Bush said. ``Mine will be somewhat more specific.''   From the Democratic side came the warning that the Republicanplatform will be full of phrases that sound acceptable to moderatevoters, but which promise nothing.   ``They'll say `We're for human rights in South Africa, but we'renot going to oppose apartheid,''' said Rep. William Gray III ofPennsylvania, who chaired the Democratic platform draftingcommittee.   Bush campaign chairman-to-be James Baker said the next two weekswill mark a watershed for Bush.   ``He will be seen in an entirely different light once he is hisparty's nominee, a bit more free to speak out, speak his own mind,and speak out on issues distinct and different from theadministration,'' said Baker, who will step down as Reagan'sTreasury secretary at the end of the GOP convention.</TEXT></DOC>
