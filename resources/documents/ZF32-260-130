 Dr. Ward Testerman, California State Polytechnic University, discussedsoftware vendors.andM;Software vendors claims they are not responsible for their products -- or forerrors or misfortune caused by their products.andP;  &quot;Does that mean we have totest every software product before we use it?&quot;andM;User protection in not yet defined.andP;  Some vendors rely on the UniformCommercial Code clause for &quot;as is&quot; products.andP;  (If you buy it &quot;as is,&quot; it'syours.andP;  Period.andP;  Go away!andP;  Don't tell me your problems!)andM;Some vendors offer &quot;limited warranties.&quot;andP;  that is to protect them, not you.andO;Everything not specified in the warranty is excluded from protection.andM;&quot;Some of the best information you can get comes from the Trade Press (orCANs) -- not from the vendors.&quot;andM;He suggested some things vendors could do:andM;* improve testing -- use diverse groups, both sophisticated andunsophisticated usersandM;* fix known problems before releaseandM;* identify those problems found after release and let the customers knowabout themandM;* provide hotlinesandM;* offer a trial priod so customers can ascertain fitandM;* commit to fixing problems for a specified period -- offer a warrenty -- asis done on new or used carsandM;* ensure that products work the way the documentation claimsandM;* provide refunds when there has been misrepresentationandM;Users have responsibilities too:andM;* Don't sell copies.andM;* Don't give away copies to be used for further copies.andM;* Don't have unlimited copies without a license.andM;CAN COMMENT: I suspect vendors would want more stringent rules.andM;&quot;The software industry is one in which a vendor can deliver a product withknown defects -- and then charge you for the corrections.&quot;andM;&quot;A software company can take somebody else's idea, copy it, and then telleverybody else not to copy their copy!&quot;andM;2.andP;  Verna Klosky, Blue Cross, discussed the privacy issue.andM;&quot;The amount of information gathered [by computers] makes possibleexploitation not previously planned [or possible].&quot;andP;  Example: your IRS formcontains information about your medical problems and your ideological,charitable, and religious affiliations.andM;&quot;There are opportunities for the misuse of information.&quot;andP;  &quot;Data can beinterpreted out of its original context.&quot;andP;  &quot;Errors can be propagated throughandlsqb;multiple] files.&quot;andP;  &quot;Decisions are made based on computerized data&quot; -- eventhough the data may be incorrect, incomplete, and/or obsolete.andM;&quot;Subjects must have the right to gain access to data collected about them.&quot;andO;&quot;Make it a crime to obtain data fraudulently.&quot;andP;  &quot;Make it a crime to keepsecret the existence of a data bank.&quot;andP;  &quot;Certain data should be deleted aftera specified period.&quot;andP;  &quot;There should be an audit of databases to detectviolations [of ethics].&quot;andM;Advice: &quot;Assume all data is private -- unless you know explicitly that it isnot.&quot;andP;  And, &quot;Be vigilant to the misuse of data.&quot;andM;3.andP;  Ronald Proulx, San Diego andamp; electric, discussed the corporate ISenvironment.andM;&quot;Who owns software?&quot;andP;  The set of rules is confusing.andP;  And they getinterpreted differently based on the status of the programmer (employee orcontractor), and when, where, why, and on what the software was developed.andO;&quot;How about software enhancements?andP;  Or extracted software?&quot;andM;&quot;Who is responsible for enforcing software piracy laws?&quot;andP;  The answer.andO;&quot;Corporate management is!&quot;andM;IS manager's responsibilities include:andM;* promoting ethical behavior to protect the corporation.andM;* building and maintaining a secure environment.andM;*dealing with violations and violators.andM;&quot;The rules should be stated clearly -- in writing -- and appliedconsistently!&quot;andM;4.andP;  Richard Leonard, The Bramas Group, discussed consultants.andM;&quot;It [being ethical] is easy until it becomes personal, then it's not!&quot;andO;Sometimes clients request consultants to do things that are unethical.andP;  Torefuse is to lose business.andP;  There is confusion over who owns software that aconsultant develops for a client -- unless the contract is very specific.andM;&quot;An act can be legal and yet unethical.&quot;andM;5.andP;  Frederick Gallegos, U.S.andP;  General Accounting Office, discussed thegovernment's position.andM;During the period 1970 to 1980, there were 200 legal initiatives concerningcomputers.andP;  During 1980 to 1990, there were 2000.andP;  &quot;There were 200 in thelast two years alone!&quot;andP;  &quot;Congress's interest is escalating.andP;  Tremendously!&quot;andM;He suggested some resources on computers and the law:andM;* The Office of Technical AssessmentandM;- Four published studies, since 1985, that document rules and violations.andM;* Congressional Research StudiesandM;* The 1980 Software Copyright ActandM;* The Computer Law JournalandM;* The Center for Computer Crime Data, Santa Cruz, California.andM;6.andP;  Dr. Ida W. Mason, California State Polytechnic University, discussedacademia.andM;&quot;When computer criminals ae categorized, the [professional] programmersoutnumber the students.&quot;andM;Computer crimes in academia include:andM;* Students using computer time without authorization.andM;* Students giving out IDs and passwords for others to use the computers.andM;* Faculty members copying software for use in the classroom.andM;* Foul play -- someone shutting down the system.andM;A study was conducted at her University.andP;  The question &quot;Would you copysoftware?&quot; brought these responses:andM;She suggesed her fellow faculty members should:andM;* Set a good example.andM;* Become concerned about educating the next generation of computerprofessionals.andM;* Encourage all levels of schools to provide education on computer ethics.andM;* Teach computer ethics.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
