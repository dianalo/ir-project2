(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The parents of eight children who includethe country's first test-tube quintuplets will receive about $1,000a month to care for three nieces, ending a four-month applicationprocess.   The state Department of Social Service on Tuesday licensed thehome of Raymond and Michele L'Esperance for foster-care, making theDavisburg family eligible for more benefits to care for itschildren. The decision was announced in Oakland County ProbateCourt, where the couple had turned in hopes of getting theirlicense application approved quickly.   ``We are elated,'' said Raymond L'Esperance, who had been tryingsince April to get the license.   The L'Esperances, parents of eight children from current andprevious marriages, began caring for the 6-, 10- and 13-year-oldnieces last year when the girls' parents sought drug and alcoholrehabilitation. The couple was receiving $295 monthly from Aid toFamilies with Dependent Children, but sought the foster-carelicense to qualify for more government aid.   Oakland County Probate Judge Barry Grant had pushed theDepartment of Social Services to act quickly.   ``It's disturbing to me what could've happened if these childrenwere not fortunate enough to be wanted by their aunt and uncle,''Grant said. ``The system, as it presently exists, is not addressingthe needs of children.''   The L'Esperances had quintuplets in 1988, believed to be thefirst conceived in vitro and successfully carried in the UnitedStates. Michele L'Esperance works in a home for battered women. Herhusband is a Macomb County corrections officer and holds a secondjob in a tool-and-die shop.   Michele L'Esperance has said it costs more than $300 a week justto feed the family.</TEXT></DOC>
