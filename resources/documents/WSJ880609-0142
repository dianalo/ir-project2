Soon, Soviet inspectors will scrutinize the newly groomed system. Then, Snakebite will be sawed apart, crushed, and torched in the U.S.    It is all part of the process of removing and destroying an entire class of European-based nuclear weapons as called for in the new superpower arms treaty recently ratified by the U.S. Senate and the Supreme Soviet.    Looking like a low-slung, camouflaged truck, Snakebite and other vehicles that carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles were put on display here and at three other U.S. bases in Europe as part of unprecedented press briefings. The vehicles will be the star attractions next month, when the U.S. and the Soviet Union formally begin the process of carrying out the arms treaty.    Greenham Common, 60 miles west of London, is home to most of England's allotment of U.S.-manned cruise missiles. It is one of 27 U.S. bases that will be visited by a team of 200 Soviet inspectors in the first phase of the destruction of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. Under the treaty, effective last week, Soviet inspectors will visit here and other sites where the missiles are stored or produced in the U.S., West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy. About 200 U.S. inspectors will tour 133 bases in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, said Lt. Col. Ken Keating, an official of the new U.S. On-Site Inspection Agency, at yesterday's news conference here.    In New York, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze invited members of the United Nations and other international bodies to watch the first round of destruction of Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles. &quot;This, of course, is not the Bolshoi Theater, but a major premiere nonetheless, a momentous historic event,&quot; Mr. Shevardnadze said. He didn't say where the destruction would take place.    At Greenham Common, Col. Bill Jones, its commander, gave reporters a base tour, including a look at the mammoth, bunker-like garages where cruise-missile launch vehicles are stored. Like Snakebite, each vehicle carries four missiles, each with a thermonuclear warhead capable of incinerating a medium-sized city.    The Soviet inspectors &quot;have 48 hours to tell me where they want to go&quot; and then they will have 24 hours to examine the base, said Col. Jones. The inspectors will be able to measure and weigh parts of the missile system and examine it with portable radiation-detection devices.    The inspection job will require a full-time bureaucracy on each side. After the initial &quot;baseline inspection,&quot; designed to affirm the number of missiles at each site, there will be additional inspections for three years to ensure the weapons' removal and destruction. A ten-year inspection period will follow to make sure new weapons aren't produced.    According to Lt. Col. Keating, Snakebite's missiles will be taken to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Ariz., and then cut in half, lengthwise. The launch vehicle also will be destroyed. Nuclear warheads, which aren't covered by the treaty, will be removed and recycled into other weapons systems.    Lt. Col. Keating said each side will decide when and where to deploy its inspection teams. The U.S. doesn't know when the first Soviet visitors will arrive at Greenham Common or other nuclear-weapons bases. Women demonstrators, who have staged some memorable protests at Greenham Common over the past five years, showed up in only token force yesterday. They pushed a sign up to the base's fence that read: &quot;Bread, not Bombs.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
