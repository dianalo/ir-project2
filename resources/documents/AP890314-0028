(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Crew members on a military helicopter thatcrashed and burned in the desert were wearing night-vision goggles,but that was not a factor in the accident that killed 15 servicemen,Air Force officials said Monday.   Use of the light-amplifying goggles has been questioned in anumber of previous military crashes.   Four Air Force Reserve crewmen and 11 Army Special Forcessoldiers from Fort Bragg, N.C., were aboard the CH-3E ``Jolly GreenGiant'' helicopter that went down Sunday night in the desert 25miles northwest of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base here.   Capt. Carlos Roque, a spokesman at Davis-Monthan, said he had noinformation on the sequence of events leading to the crash anddidn't know if there had been any radio transmissions.   Sgt. Jill Archer quoted Airman 1st Class John E. Klemack, aspokesman for the 71st Special Operations Squadron at Davis-Monthan,the crew's unit, as saying: ```We don't know what height they wereflying at when the crash occurred.''   The Vietnam-era helicopter, assigned to Davis-Monthan, wasferrying the soldiers from Fort Huachuca, 79 miles southeast ofTucson, to an Air Force gunnery range at Gila Bend, 124 milesnorthwest of Tucson.   It went down in an uninhabited area adjacent to the SaguaroNational Monument about 20 miles northwest of Tucson, after stoppingat Davis-Monthan to refuel, Roque said.   ``I looked up and I seen a yellow ball, like flames, coming outof the back,'' said Mike Skrekas, who lives a few miles from thecrash site. ``Five seconds later I saw it hit the ground, and thenthere was a red fireball.''   A second helicopter was accompanying it but was a reasonabledistance away and was not involved in the crash, Roque said.   More than 300 CH-3Es and similar helicopters belonging to the AirForce, Navy and Coast Guard were grounded for a week that endedFriday to inspect for a ``bad part'' in the main rotor head, NavyCmdr. David Thomas, a Pentagon spokesman, said early Tuesday.   Air Force Lt. Col. Darrel Hayes said the helicopter that crashedwas inspected last Friday and had its main rotor head shaft nutreplaced. It was flown safely three times after that work.   Officials at Davis-Monthan grounded the base's five remainingCH-3Es until the cause of the crash is determined, the publicaffairs office said.   Roque said the flight crew was wearing night-vision goggles thatamplify low light but that investigators had determined that thegoggles ``were not a factor in the accident.''   Roque said previous helicopter crashes in which pilots werewearing such goggles ``were flying low-level or in close proxmity''with other aircraft and that the goggles, ``when used in closeproximity or low level, may have caused a vision problem.''   He said the flight from Tucson to Gila Bend was to be ``aregular, straight, level flight.'' That is, ``it didn't involve anycapabilities other than flying in a straight line,'' as opposed tolow-level ``nap of the earth'' flying, following the contour of theland, he explained.   ``They were not doing that on this flight,'' said Roque, ``and asa result when they were using the night-vision goggles they were inopen air space and not in proximity to anything.''   Critics have questioned whether the goggles function adequatelywhen there is no moon or in cloudy weather that obscures stars. TheNational Weather Service said there were high thin clouds over theTucson area Sunday night and that visibility was 30 miles. The crashoccured about an hour after sunset and about two hours before therise of a quarter-moon.   The Orange County (Calif.) Register reported that since 1978, 37of 41 Army helicopter crashes in which night goggles were usedoccurred when there was not enough moonlight for the devices toamplify. Those crashes killed 65 soldiers, the newspaper reported.   The CH-3 series of helicopters was designed in the late 1950s andearly 1960s and is still flown by the Air Force, Navy and CoastGuard. The Air Force began flying the choppers in 1962 and has 63left in its inventory.   Ms. Archer identified four of the victims as Lt. Colonel LawrenceM. Rolle, 41, of Phoenix, the reserve squadron commander who wasflying as co-pilot; Maj. Donald D. Thomas, 42, of Tempe, the pilot;Master Sgt. Malte Breitlow, 45, of Tucson; and Tech. Sgt. William E.Slaven, 37, also of Tucson.   Other names were not immediately released. Roque said the bodieswould have to be identified through medical and dental records.   The soldiers were attached to the 3rd Battalion, 5th SpecialForces group at Fort Bragg, N.C., said Army Maj. Richard Adams.Another spokesman at the fort said they had been at Fort Huachucasince Wednesday and had been scheduled to leave April 9.</TEXT></DOC>
