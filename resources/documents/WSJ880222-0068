It's no secret that inventory has been building: Last year, stockpiling accounted for about 36% of the rise in real GNP. And the revised fourth-quarter gross national product figure due Thursday is expected to show an annual growth rate of about 5%, up from the preliminary 4.2% gain reported last month. A good portion of the growth is attributed to overhang in retail trade and machinery.    The inventory boost &quot;is an ominous development for a 'mature' expansion,&quot; as big overhangs preceded the recessions of 1973-75 and 1981-82, says Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    Much of the output from U.S. factories lately seems to go either on the ship or on the shelf. Economists such as Mr. Roach fear that if export demand slows, the build-up of goods could pinch output and turn a mere slowdown into a full-blown recession this year.    Others, of course, believe exports won't flag and domestic demand will help dispose of goods.    &quot;We're going to spend a whole year worrying about inventory,&quot; says Greg Smith, chief strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    Inventory-probing is in vogue because &quot;there are thousands of analysts looking for trouble&quot; in the wake of the stock market crash,&quot; he says.    Nonetheless, Mr. Smith has spent considerable time studying inventory, which he says is &quot;the burning issue for the first six months of this year, replacing trade as an important ingredient in market forecasts.&quot; But he adds: &quot;I don't think it's a recession-causer.&quot;    Neither do economists at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., who expect the economy to adjust to overbuilt inventories with a &quot;brief period of weakness, but no recession.&quot;    David A. Levine and Giulio Martini, economists at Bernstein, believe the economy is biding a four-week to eight-week inventory adjustment as it responds to &quot;temporary&quot; weakness in demand during crash-dazed October and November.    Last week's reports on January industrial production and capacity utilization encouraged inventory worriers.    Output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities continued to rise in January, albeit at a modest 0.2% after December's revised 0.4% increase. And those companies operated at 82.2% of capacity, maintaining December's strong rate.    &quot;It's a welcome development in the face of very significant inventory overhang,&quot; says Morgan Stanley's Mr. Roach. A slowing of growth in production gives companies the ability to work off some inventory. And economists note that the steady operating rate indicates continued strength in the manufacturing sector.    The next readings on the pulse of demand from U.S. consumers may come in January durable-goods orders due out tomorrow and personal income and consumption figures expected Friday. Economic analysts figure personal income rose about 0.3% and consumption rose about 0.6%, both below December gains.    Durable-goods orders probably stayed in an upward trend thanks to export demand for machinery and materials as well as a pickup in orders for computers and office equipment, economic analysts say.    Meanwhile, consumers' appetite for autos appears good.    Early-February North American-built car sales edged up 0.3%, according to figures reported last week. That translates into a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.1 million vehicles, compared with a 7.7 million rate a year earlier. This week's mid-February report on car sales will tell whether that pace was being maintained.    The picture was bleaker on the housing front. January housing starts, released last week, fell 1.9% to the lowest level since the end of the last recession. Still, some housing analysts viewed the plunge as a bottoming out rather than an indication of continuing decline.    The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were being built at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1,380,000 units last month. The January setback followed a 15.5% drop in starts in December.    January building permits, a longer-range measure of construction plans, fell a steeper 8.2% to an annual rate of 1,250,000 units, the lowest level for permits since January 1985.    A McGraw-Hill Inc. unit survey of construction work released last week found that 1988 construction contracting is expected to slip 4% from 1987 to $246.2 billion. Non-residential contracts are likely to fall the most, with an expected 7% decline. Still, McGraw-Hill noted that the credit-sensitive construction industry won't be seriously hurt &quot;as long as a general recession can be avoided.&quot;    ---   THREE-IN-ONE: The Federal Reserve Board last week decided to release all three money supply measures on a weekly basis. Previously, the Fed had released only M-1 each week. The other two, M-2 and M-3, were released monthly. Today's chart reflects the change.    ---   NON-BUYING POWER: Several municipalities are using their purchasing clout to further a cause. The Council on Economic Priorities reports that at least 42 communities are banning buying from companies involved in South Africa or producing for the nuclear weapons industry.    Cities in California, including Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco and West Hollywood, are among the leaders in restrictive buying policies. But some northern metropolises are also in the fold, including Pittsburgh, Newark, N.J., and Minneapolis.    ---                    The Economy in Numbers             Statistics released in the Past Week                                               CHANGE                                               (from prior                                   TOTAL       period) New car sales                   192,001       + 0.3% Early Feb. vs. year-ago Capacity utilization              82.2%       Unch.
