MILLS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   House and Senate leaders are presentingsimilar versions of what they say is long-overdue acid rainlegislation that stands a good chance of passing this year.   ``For seven years, we have supported legislation to control acidrain,'' Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, said at a news conferenceWednesday to announce a tentative acid rain plan agreed to by 27senators. ``Three times in this decade the Committee on Environmentand Public Works has reported such legislation ... but thus far,the legislation has not been considered in the Senate.''   On the other side of the Capitol, Rep. Sherwood Boehlert,R-N.Y., was joined by Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, New York Gov.Mario Cuomo and three Ohio congressmen when he announcedlegislation patterned after a compromise reached by the twogovernors last month.   Both plans call for a 10-million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxideemissions from old coal-fired utility plants, as compared to a12-million-ton reduction called for in amendments to the Clean AirAct now stalled in the Senate. The Boehlert bill would giveutilities 15 years to comply, while the Senate plan gives them 12.   Figuring that it will cost about $1.8 billion a year to reduceemissions, the Boehlert bill proposes that polluters pay half thatcost, the oil industry pay $650 million a year through fees to thefederal government for oil storage, and the federal government paythe remaining $250 million annually.   The Senate measure suggests a cost-sharing effort tied to theamount of electricity generated but giving credit to those statesthat have already implemented acid rain controls.   The Senate measure is not yet in the form of a bill, butMitchell said it probably would be introduced as an amendment to anappropriate legislative vehicle. He refused to be more specific.   ``In terms of timing, we rule nothing in or out,'' he said. ``Wewill do it at the time that seems most opportune for advancing thislegislation.''   He said he would drop efforts to get a vote on the existingamendments to the Clean Air Act, stalled in the Senate since lastNovember.   He also said he did not anticipate the usual roadblocks to acidrain legislation, such as the opposition of Rep. John Dingell,D-Mich., who has protected interests of his state's auto industry,or Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who represents alarge coal-mining state.   ``From the standpoint of an opponent, this may be a veryopportune time to act,'' Mitchell said, noting that both apparentpresidential candidates have voiced support for acid rainlegislation.   Byrd is studying the plan, but ``As of this time, we do not havethe support of Sen. Byrd,'' Mitchell noted.   Several senators expressed reservation about cost-sharing,details of which are still being worked out.   ``I firmly believe that polluters should pay to clean up theirdirty facilities,'' Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H., said. ``Iendorse this new approach to acid rain control which includes acost-sharing proposal in the hope that this compromise may finallyhave what it takes to enact effective acid rain controls.''   But Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., called the plan ``the fairestway, cost-wise.'' He estimated that in Western states, utilitycustomers might see another 30 cents to 40 cents on their monthlybills while in a state like Massachusetts, people might expect topay another 80 cents.   For the most part, the legislators were upbeat about the chancesof passing a bill, now that Ohio and New York have put forward asolution.   ``Every passing day brings another indication that Congress isserious about meeting its responsibilities to act on acid rain,''Cuomo said. ``Today, you've seen two very big indications.''   Sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal have beenblamed as a major cause of acid rain, which environmentalists sayis destroying waters and woodlands in the Northeast. Much of thesulfur dioxide comes from coal-burning power plants along the OhioRiver.</TEXT></DOC>
