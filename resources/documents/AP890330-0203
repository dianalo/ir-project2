Milken should speed settlement of fraud charges againsthis former bosses while provoking an intense legal battle over theuse of racketeering laws, defense lawyers say.   The Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier _ the crown jewel in atwo-year investigation of the Wall Street investment firm _ wascharged Wednesday along with his brother and an associate, who facemammoth prison terms and up to $11 billion in penalties.   Defense lawyers attacked the 98-count indictment on racketeeringand securities fraud charges as an abuse of prosecutorial power, arehash of old allegations and a tool to wrench cooperation fromother Drexel employees.   They also called the charges a ``perversion'' of the federalRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, which wasestablished in 1970 principally to combat organized crime but isused increasingly to prosecute white-collar criminals.   ``I think it is outrageous to use RICO in a circumstance likethis,'' said Michael Armstrong, an attorney for Lowell Milken.``They applied the statute to behavior which for the most part hasnot been considered even to be criminal, much less the subject of aracketeering indictment.''   While certain to be hotly contested, the charges against Milken,42, who almost single-handedly created the $175 billion high-yieldjunk bond industry, are expected to help resolve separate civil andcriminal charges against Drexel.   Negotiations between Drexel and the Securities and ExchangeCommission to settle civil fraud charges, including insidertrading, deadlocked earlier this month when the firm balked at aprovision to fire Milken before resolving the claims.   With the indictment, Drexel placed Milken on leave from thefirm, clearing one roadblock. Once the SEC settlement on the civilcharges is signed, Drexel is to plead guilty to six felonies andpay $650 million to settle criminal fraud charges brought by theManhattan U.S. attorney's office.   At issue in all the investigations, accusations and negotiationsis the use of federal racketeering statutes and government power toobtain cooperation from defendants in cases linked to theconfessions of jailed insider trader Ivan Boesky.   Drexel has said publicly it agreed to settle with the governmentlast December to avoid a racketeering indictment that could havefrozen its multibillion-dollar assets and crippled its operations.   As part of the pact, the nation's fifth-largest brokerage houseagreed to fire Milken and withhold his 1988 pay, estimated at $100million to $200 million. In the SEC deal, the government reportedlywants to bar Milken from the firm for life and prohibit Drexelemployees from talking business with him.   The wide-ranging charges in the 110-page indictment of theMilkens and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg parallel lastSeptember's SEC complaint and the government's racketeeringindictment of Princeton-Newport LP, a defunct investmentpartnership, a month earlier. Newberg also was charged in thatcase, set for trial June 5.   Drexel allegedly illegally concealed the ownership of blocks ofstock for Princeton-Newport in a deal engineered by Milken.   In its lengthy probe of Drexel that began when Boesky squealedin late 1986, the government has achieved but one criminalconviction: Lisa Jones, a 26-year-old bond trader's helper foundguilty last week of lying to a grand jury in the Princeton-Newportprobe.   A major point of contention in the new indictment promises to bethe government's attempt to seize under the RICO law $3.7 billionfrom each of the defendants _ twice the total amount of theirsalaries, stock holdings and other compensation from 1984 through1987, plus interest. In addition, Michael Milken faces a sentenceof up to 520 years in prison.   The indictment says Michael Milken amassed a fortune of morethan $1 billion in the four years through his prowess as the headof Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based high-yield bond division,in part from his relationship with Boesky.   It maintains that all money made by the men _ through illicttrades or not _is tainted because it constitutes ``the proceeds oftheir unlawful schemes and their interest in the racketeeringenterprise charged.'' Drexel is considered the racketeeringenterprise and Michael Milken its leader.   The charges against Milken include using illegal insideinformation about merger proposals to arrange deals and stockmanipulation. Only one transaction has not been publicized before.   The government has 70 days to bring its case to trial unless ajudge grants an extension or defense attorneys file motionsdelaying the case, which they said is likely.   ``We will fight this case in the courts, the sanctuary of dueprocess, not in the press,'' said Arthur L. Liman, Michael Milken'sattorney. ``You cannot cross-examine a leak, you can cross-examinea Boesky.''</TEXT></DOC>
