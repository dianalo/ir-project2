On one wall a deluxe condominium in Hawaii is depicted. On another hangs a picture of a $5.5 million mansion in Monterey, Calif. The business boasts a steady flow of wealthy Japanese individuals.    &quot;Since the yen-appreciation panic in the second week of January, business has soared,&quot; says Michio Itoh, a manager of Seiyo Corp., the real-estate unit of Seibu Department Stores Ltd. &quot;Unless the yen goes back sharply, say to 200 (per dollar) or so, our business will double this year.&quot;    Japan's real-estate investment in the U.S. more than tripled last year, to an estimated total of nearly $6 billion. The big push into American real estate was fueled largely by the sharp rise of the yen against the dollar, which makes such purchases relatively cheap for Japanese investors.    With the continuing surge of the yen this year, analysts are predicting the investment boom will continue. &quot;Japan's real-estate investment (in the U.S.) last year was just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; says an officer at a major Japanese commercial bank.    In 1986, he adds, buyers of American real estate were mostly sophisticated institutions, such as Shuwa Investment Co., Mitsui Real Estate Development Co. and Nippon Life Insurance Co. But publicity campaigns in Japan -- some of them organized by the large institutional investors themselves -- are quickly expanding the ranks of willing buyers to include many individuals, among them lawyers, doctors and operators of small and medium-sized businesses.    Some investors are like Zenzaburo Hara, the owner of a company that makes bath equipment. Mr. Hara is negotiating for the purchase of his second villa near Diamond Head on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. &quot;Real-estate investments are a dream, because their value will never decline,&quot; he says optimistically.    Mr. Hara also says he chose Hawaii because to have an asset in the U.S. is not only a status symbol but also would make it easier for him to operate a business in the U.S. in the future.    Others, such as Hiroyasu Seike, say they are investing in American real estate because they can no longer get the same return on investments in Japanese rental properties. Mr. Seike already owns three condominiums in Japan, but recently branched out into Guam, buying a property for $122,000 that he expects to earn him a 7% annual return. Mr. Seike says soaring land prices in Japan all but prohibit that kind of return on real-estate investments here.    Over the past decade, it has become popular for middle-level salaried workers in Japan to invest in small one-room apartments, known as &quot;mansions,&quot; as rental properties. But faced with soaring land prices and growing government restrictions on construction, some analysts say the supply of such rental properties is on the decline.    &quot;Because of the low return and also the shortage of supply of land, investment in Japanese real estate has become boring&quot; for wealthy Japanese individuals, says Mr. Itoh of Seiyo Corp. &quot;Besides that, there is the growing risk of drawing a joker, as a result of the sharp rise in land prices in recent years.&quot;    Both Japanese and American brokers are encouraging the flow of investments into the U.S. Shuwa Investment Co., which bought Arco Plaza in Los Angeles and the ABC building in New York last year, recently announced a plan to begin a foreign real-estate brokerage for Japanese individual investors. Shuwa has placed full-page ads in major Japanese daily newspapers, soliciting investors.    In the U.S., Clifford Ujiie, a Los Angeles-based realtor who arranged investments in properties such as small office buildings, apartment houses and small warehouses for several Japanese individual investors last year, says his customers were encouraged by the yen's sharp appreciation and also by the institutional investors.    Mr. Ujiie says: &quot;My clients had been vacillating, but they invested last year (as they) were encouraged by seeing large Japanese institutional investors investing.&quot; According to him, many of the individual investors so far are people familiar with the U.S. through their frequent visits on vacation.    Real-estate industry officials also say Japanese banks and other financial institutions are encouraging wealthy customers to invest in the U.S., taking advantage of low interest rates in Japan. Some bank officials acknowledge that, faced with sluggish loan demand because of a capital-spending slump in Japan, banks are willing to lend more for real-estate investment.    While loans outstanding to Japanese manufacturers from Japanese commercial banks at the end of 1986 were 1.6% below the year-earlier level, real-estate related lending was up 35%. The banks are extending dollar-based, as well yen-based loans.    Analysts say that while the sharp rise in land prices in Japan has reduced the chance to secure a high return on new investments, it also has increased the value of real estate, making it easier for landowners to get loans from banks and other financial institutions.    Another factor behind the projected rise in individual Japanese investors in U.S. real estate is the potential tax benefit, particularly if a company is set up for investment purposes. According to Mr. Hara of the bath-equipment company, he has to pay more than 60% of his income in taxes. But through real-estate investments he can lower his tax bracket and get a tax credit for expenses resulting from the investment.    Mr. Hara says he has been &quot;paying a tremendous amount of tax every year, but I think the time has come for me to consider tax saving. If I don't take any action, it will be taken away totally.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
