Terms weren't disclosed.    The sale was the first by Lear Siegler since the company was taken private in January through a $2.1 billion leveraged buyout by New York investment partnership Forstmann Little andamp; Co. and officers of Lear Siegler. Lear Siegler Holdings, a successor company to Lear Siegler Inc., is an aerospace and industrial concern based in Santa Monica, Calif. The name was changed as part of the buyout.    Piper, based in Vero Beach, is a maker of small aircraft. Its annual sales, estimated by analysts at less than $100 million, have plummeted in recent years in line with a slump in the small-aircraft industry.    In a brief statement, Newport Beach, Calif.-based Romeo Charlie said it intends to reestablish Piper as a leader in the small-aircraft business.    In February, Lear Siegler said it planned to sell other holdings, among them the company's Smith andamp; Wesson firearms subsidiary, the Starcraft recreational vehicle and boat manufacturing subsidiaries, the Peerless truck-trailer and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturing operations, and the cotton ginning and vegetable oil processing units of the Producers Cotton Oil Co. subsidiary.    A spokesman for Lear Siegler said none of those subsidiaries has been sold. </TEXT></DOC>
