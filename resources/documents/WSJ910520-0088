The sudden move by the Dow Jones-Group W partnership,which had been in a bidding war to acquire FNN, clears theway for NBC's Consumer News and Business Channel to buy itsonly rival in the all-business cable arena for $154.3million, including $145 million in cash. CNBC, a unit ofGeneral Electric Co., said it would shut down FNN.</LP><TEXT>   The Dow Jones-Group W move to drop the case resulted froma split between the two partners over whether to continuefighting to block the NBC bid. Dow Jones had wanted tocontinue pursuing a legal challenge, said Peter G. Skinner, asenior vice president at Dow Jones. But Group W, a unit ofWestinghouse Electric Corp., didn't. &quot;Reasonable men differ,&quot;Mr. Skinner said. &quot;We couldn't go on alone. Westinghousedidn't think our chances of success were great. We thoughtthey were.&quot;   Donald Mitzner, president of Group W, said: &quot;At a certainpoint in time, you say, `Enough.'&quot;   The move marked an about-face by Group W and Dow Jones,the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Only a week ago thepartners had strongly stated the battle was far from over andhad expressed optimism that they would prevail on antitrustgrounds. U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Francis G. Conrad hadbeen scheduled to hear arguments this morning from the DowJones and Group W partnership on whether to grant a temporaryrestraining order delaying the NBC deal.   Instead, during a conference call on Friday, Judge Conradheard Dow Jones-Group W withdraw its legal objections. Inaddition, attorneys general for Pennsylvania and Illinois areunderstood to have withdrawn their objections, which also hadbeen filed on antitrust grounds.   The action ends a bidding contest that began in Februarywhen Dow Jones-Group W reached a tentative agreement topurchase FNN for $90 million. Two weeks later, CNBC scuttledthe sale with a bid of $105 million. On May 9 Judge Conradaccepted CNBC's final bid of $154.3 million, including $145million in cash and $9.3 million in assumption ofliabilities. CNBC would also pay FNN half of any revenueexceeding $227 million over three years, once the twochannels are combined. FNN itself had projected a three-yearrevenue total of as much as $226 million without a merger.   CNBC's acquisition is expected to close early this week.Tom Rogers, president of NBC's cable division, said FNN wouldbe merged with CNBC. The so-called merger will mean that FNN,which was founded in November 1981 and is available to about35 million subscribers, will disappear from cable systems andwill be replaced by CNBC, which started in 1989 and isavailable to 18 million subscribers. An NBC spokesman saidyesterday that the acquisition will boost CNBC's subscriberbase to a number &quot;in excess of 35 million.&quot;   Many of FNN's 280 employees are likely to be fired. AlBarber, CNBC's president, said in a recent interview thatCNBC may hire &quot;in excess of 50&quot; FNN employees.   Alan J. Hirschfield, FNN's co-chief executive officer,said in an interview that he is &quot;gratified&quot; with the priceCNBC is paying and added it is &quot;best for the shareholders andcreditors to close this deal as soon as possible.&quot; In March,FNN filed for Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection fromcreditor lawsuits, listing liabilities of nearly twice itstotal assets of $75.5 million.   The acquisition could pose some conflicts. For instance,FNN produces a daily program, &quot;Business This Morning,&quot; thatis syndicated to television stations nationwide. WCBS, theCBS Inc.-owned flagship station in New York, broadcasts theshow. If CNBC continues the arrangement, a show produced byan NBC unit would be aired on rival CBS.   Mr. Skinner of Dow Jones said, &quot;We remain committed in ourbelief that Dow Jones should have a greater presence ontelevision and we're going to try and find ways to do that.&quot;   It's unlikely, he added, that the venture would be anationwide launch of a cable network.</TEXT></DOC>
