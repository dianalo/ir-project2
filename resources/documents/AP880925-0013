Leading in growth was the island of Guam, where net immigrationhelped boost population sharply.   Both military personnel and civilian workers from thePhilippines helped increase Guam's population, the report said.   Between 1980 and 1987 the population of Guam jumped by 24,400,or 23.1 percent, to 130,400, the Bureau said. Of the increase,5,200 were immigrants.   The Northern Mariana Islands were second in growth, increasing21.1 percent to a total of 20,300 people last year. This increasewas largely from births, however.   And American Samoa added 19 percent to its population to climbto 38,400, also due to an increase in births.   On the other side of the nation, the U.S. Virgin Islands hadpopulation growth of 9.8 percent to a 1987 total of 106,100 people.Natural increase overcame the departure of 4,400 people to keepgrowth ahead of the U.S. national average of 7.4 percent.   That was not the case, however, with Puerto Rico, where thedeparture of 227,000 residents between 1980 and 1987 held theislands's overall growth to just 3.0 percent during the period.   Puerto Rico's total population was 3,292,000 last year, up95,000 from the 1980 census.</TEXT></DOC>
