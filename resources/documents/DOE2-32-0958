Althoughthere were no significantly higher tumour rates found with any of thefibers applied, high rates of bronchio-alveolar hyperplasies (74%), plateepithel metaplasy in one case, and adenoidal cancer after crocidolitetreatments were found to be indicative of the tendency of crocidoliteto induce neoplasms. After i.p. injections of 0.5 mg tumour rates were17% in the case of JM 104/475 glass fibers and 55% in the case of crocidoliteof South African origin. The parallelism of the diagnoses of humans exposedto crocidolite and of i.p. injections in rats shows the validity of thei.p. model. Valuable results were obtained with regard to the persistenceof glass fibers in lungs after inhalation.</TEXT></DOC>
