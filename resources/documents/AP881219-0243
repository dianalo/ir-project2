The tables holding the wedding feast were covered with thetablecloths and set with her mixed collection of colorful Depressionglass and Fiestaware. The menu consisted mainly of food made by thebride.   It was a prime example of couples planning their wedding as avery personal event.   Gauthier-Reed says colorful tables are conducive to a festiveatmosphere. Though unassuming and not normally for a formal table,the settings were a delightful surprise to guests at her wedding,she says.   Gauthier-Reed, a 25-year-old graphic artist, says she learnedsome of her stylish ways by working as an assistant to MarthaStewart, the food stylist and author of books on party-giving,including ``Weddings.''   She put Stewart's lessons on color to use at her own wedding tocreate a relatively inexpensive event that was nevertheless original.   The menu included a salad of thinly-sliced filet of beef and redand yellow peppers, carrots and snow peas in vinaigrette dressing.There was also tortellini salad with pesto, sesame noodles, tomatoand red onion salad and broccoli.   Table garnishes included a mix of black, purple, red, yellow,green and orange peppers and edible nasturtium flowers.   ``We didn't have fancy food, just a simple menu of homemade food.But everyone said it was the most elegant wedding they had gone to.I think the table settings had a lot to do with that. It was aunique way of expressing ourselves,'' she says.   So pleased was she with the wedding and the enjoyment she got outof using her rapidly-enlarging collection of dinnerware andtablecloths from the 1930s and early '40s that she decided theexperience held the seeds of a new business idea.   She has launched a business renting the pieces to others forparties and special occasions.   ``Depression glass was the poor person's colored crystal. It wasgiven away as a bonus when people bought their groceries. You couldalso buy it for about a quarter a place setting,'' she says.   Formerly scorned and found in junk shops, Depression glass andother old favorites such as Fiestaware and Fire King dishes nowcommand good prices and are getting harder to find.   Though her new business is unusual, it is not unique, she says.She came across the idea in California where it appears to haveoriginated.   ``I realized this business could be the perfect solution. I wouldearn money to support our collecting and, after renting it out, I'dget the whole collection back at the end of the day,'' she says.</TEXT></DOC>
