Back in the heyday of the 1980s real estate boom, morethan 150 pension funds plowed hundreds of millions of dollarsinto the Travelers Corp. real estate fund known as &quot;SeparateAccount R.&quot; The money was pooled to buy office buildings,hotels and other commercial properties around the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   Then the real estate market tanked, pulling down the valueof Separate Account R and other real estate pools. ButTravelers' problems with Separate Account R are somethingspecial.   Some of the 146 institutional investors left in SeparateAccount R, which has now dwindled to $225 million, are soirate over Travelers' handling of their money they want thebig insurance company to name an outside manager to take overthe real estate. &quot;It appears that Travelers is incapable ofproperly managing Separate Account R,&quot; Claude Perrier,executive director of the $1.8 billion Maine RetirementSystem, groused to Travelers in a letter in April.   Among the complaints, some big investors think they havebeen charged excessive fees by Travelers, which the insurerdenies. The Dallas Police and Fire Pension Fund has taken theunusual step of suing Travelers in state court in Dallas,alleging mismanagement of the account. Travelers, whichrequested the suit be moved to federal court, said theinsurer has &quot;strong defenses to the allegations, and we willcertainly assert them.&quot;   Meanwhile, almost all the investors in the account --which include pension plans of Texaco Inc. and Allied-SignalInc., the pension account of a Manhattan physician and hissecretary, and even $59 million from Travelers own employeeretirement fund -- have demanded their money back from theinsurer.   In short, Separate Account R has been a monkey onTravelers' back it is trying hard to shake. &quot;It is ourintention, come hell or high water, to terminate thisaccount,&quot; John Prom, a Travelers second vice presidentworking on Separate Account R, said at a meeting withinvestors this past week. &quot;We want to get back some of thegood will we have lost in this process.&quot;   Rarely has the dissatisfaction of institutional investorswith one of their investment managers become as high as thatinvolving Separate Account R. But despite their size andsupposed clout, the experience of big investors in trying toget their money out of real estate pools is no better thanthat of small investors who bought into real estate limitedpartnerships and are now stuck with losing investments.   Although real estate pools are not as liquid as stocks andbonds, big investors had always assumed they could get theirmoney with relative ease. That was true as long as realestate prices were rising, but as the market began to softenseveral years ago, there was a rush to join withdrawal lists,such as those for Separate Account R. Travelers says thatabout 90% of the investors in Separate Account R now wantout.   For real estate pools like Separate Account R, withdrawaldemands rise when falling real estate sales prices producethe least cash to pay off investors. That means investors mayhave to wait years for their money and may get back much lessthan what they had hoped for as real estate values plummet.The process has been made even more difficult as the federalgovernment sells real estate from the portfolios of troubledsavings and loan associations.   &quot;It has not been a fun period for us, and it has not beena fun period for you, but the real estate market in thiscountry has been a disaster,&quot; Thomas Keating, Travelerssenior vice president, said at the meeting with investorslast week.   At the meeting, Travelers tried to quell the investorunrest by agreeing to cut the fee it charges on SeparateAccount R. The fee, which has been 1% of the assets undermanagement, will drop by a quarter of a percentage point ineach of the three years that Travelers says it will take tosell off properties owned by the account.   Travelers also agreed to demands from pension funds thatthey be allowed to form a committee to oversee the insurer'shandling of the account. &quot;We have a concern about the abilityof the Travelers to do what they say they are going to do,&quot;said Maine's Mr. Perrier in proposing the oversightcommittee.   Word of Travelers' fee cut and acceptance of the oversightcommittee came at the unusual meeting last week withofficials of 20 pension funds. Travelers executivesoverseeing Separate Account R admitted mistakes incommunicating with investors, but defended their overallperformance.   &quot;We feel bad about this,&quot; Travelers' Mr. Prom said at themeeting with investors. &quot;We have one goal in this -- that isto get you your money at maximum value.&quot;   High on the list of complaints by pension-fund officialsat the meeting was a decision by Travelers to pay outwithdrawals from the account on a pro-rata basis, instead ofa first-come, first-served basis, as had been done untilTravelers halted withdrawal payments to investors in January.The switch to pro-rata payments was necessary in aliquidation process under federal pension regulations,Travelers officials said.   But pension funds near the front of the line on afirst-come, first-served basis, such as Rohm andamp; Haas Co.'spension fund, questioned the switch, because they wouldreceive less on a pro-rata basis. One allegation in theDallas lawsuit is that the Travelers' own employee pensionfund would benefit from the switch, since that fund was lowerdown on the withdrawal list.   Travelers said it would fight the lawsuit brought by theDallas pension fund, and said that clients weren't consultedabout the switch because there was no choice. &quot;It was not onthe basis of arrogance&quot; that Travelers didn't contactclients, Mr. Prom said.   At the meeting, Travelers officials said they hadtentative or firm agreements to sell eight Separate Account Rproperties for a total of about $40 million -- almost thesame amount at which the properties are currently appraised.   However, under questioning, Travelers officials indicatedthat almost all the sale prices were below the originalpurchase prices.   &quot;I'm glad they (Travelers officials) finally responded tosome of the pressure and criticism, but I wish they hadstarted it earlier,&quot; Michael McGuire, trustee for the GrandRapids, Mich., public employee pension fund, which is aSeparate Account R investor, said yesterday.   &quot;We believe it could be the first step in a process thatwill lead to solutions which would be acceptable to allparticipants,&quot; a Travelers spokesman said of the meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
