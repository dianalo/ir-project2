Far from expanding these subsidies by granting extra bandwidth for through-the-air analog broadcast technologies such as HDTV, however, the FCC should actually begin a phased withdrawal of current TV spectrum space. Since television has the far better alternative of fiber and cable, the FCC should continue doggedly to deny TV broadcasters scarce spectrum resources. Spectrum space is sorely needed by such mobile systems as cellular phones, laptop computers, paging systems, CB radios, air and ground traffic controllers, and a wide array of other portable uses for police, medical, military, trucking, Federal Express, and other vital public needs. The ultimate vision of the Dick Tracy wristwatch phone, using spectrum on every hand, moves closer year by year. </TEXT></DOC>
