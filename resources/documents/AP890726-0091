Alluding to recent allegations about fraud andinfluence-peddling under his predecessor at HUD, Kemp said it wasappropriate that he address the aging committee because ``there isno secretary in the Cabinet who is aging faster.''   He pledged that ``as we go about the Herculean task of cleaningout the Aegean stables ... I feel quite confident that we can moveforward on policy, programs, reports to meet the great goals of theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.''   On Tuesday, Kemp said in an interview on CBS-TV he believes``there'll be some people that go to jail,'' and some ought to goto jail for their roles in the scandal. He did not identify anyindividuals he had in mind.   Kemp said he was ``shocked at the extent'' the scandal ``reachedinto the management of HUD'' in the previous administration.   Kemp's predecessor, Samuel Pierce, won't have to return untilSeptember to testify before a panel investigating alleged fraud andinfluence-peddling at the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment.   Pierce had been scheduled to testify Aug. 3, but the House panelinvestigating the HUD case granted an extension to give him moretime to prepare.   Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the House GovernmentOperations subcommittee on employment and housing, said in a letterto Pierce he agreed to the delay ``based on your apparentdifficulty in retaining counsel to represent you at thesubcommittee hearing.''   Pierce had been scheduled to face questions on his role in HUDapproval of more than $15 million in grants and subsidies for aNorth Carolina project that was supported by a former law partnerof Pierce.   In his prior appearance before the subcommittee, Pierce said hetook no direct role in HUD funding decisions.   Since then, however, there have been a number of indicationsthat Pierce was more active in HUD projects than his testimonyindicated, including sworn testimony from a former HUD official whosaid Pierce personally ordered her to approve funding for the NorthCarolina project.   Also on Tuesday, the Justice Department said it is sending twoattorneys to Denver to help federal prosecutors in Coloradoinvestigate cases of fraud against HUD.   William C. Hendricks III, head of the department's fraudsection, said HUD fraud in Colorado is so extensive that a largenumber of foreclosed properties on the market has depressed thebuilding market.   Denver will become the second city where Washington-based fraudprosecutors have been detailed to investigate HUD cases. ThreeJustice Department prosecutors have been working for the past yearin Oklahoma City, assisting in the prosecution of HUD andbank-fraud cases in Oklahoma.   So far, the Oklahoma City task force has obtained 16 felonyconvictions.   Also, The New York Times reported today that HUD documentsprovide the latest Republican luminary to be tied to HUD lobbying:Former Sen. George Murphy of California lobbied on behalf of Bostonhousing projects that later received millions of dollars inassistance.   The documents, the newspaper said, also show that Murphydiscussed potential business deals with former HUD official DeborahGore Dean, including a proposal for her to serve as a book agent onhis memoirs. Murphy was quoted as saying in an interview that thebook deal was not pursued and that his contacts with Ms. Dean wereproper.</TEXT></DOC>
