Nixon Jr.,arguing the Senate impeachment procedures under which he wasremoved from the bench were unconstitutional, wants a federal courtto restore his judicial pay and benefits.   Nixon's lawyers this week said mediation was unlikely to resolvehis lawsuit which challenges the Senate vote Nov. 3 to remove himfrom office.   A federal jury convicted Nixon in 1986 of lying to a federalgrand jury when he denied discussing a marijuana case with adistrict attorney. The Senate vote stripped him of his title ofU.S. district judge and $89,500 salary.   The lawsuit asserts Nixon's conviction is unconstitutionalbecause it was based on a trial before a committee of 12 senators,rather than the full Senate. The Senate impeachment rule and aresolution setting up the committee are unconstitutional, thelawsuit says.   The Senate voted 89-9 to convict Nixon of lying to the grandjury when he denied discussing the marijuana case with theprosecutor. Senators also voted 78-19 to convict him of lying to afederal grand jury when he said he had nothing to do with themarijuana case and had never tried to influence its outcome.   Nixon's lawsuit against the U.S. government is assigned to U.S.District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer, with both sides to submit apre-trial schedule to Oberdorfer by March 8. The lawsuit was filedNov. 20.   On Jan. 22, Oberdorfer said lawyers for the government and Nixonshould discuss referring the dispute for mediation on some or allof the issues in the case.   But David Stewart, one of Nixon's lawyers, said Tuesday that``this is a constitutional issue, not a commercial dispute,''indicating that Stewart doesn't regard mediation as appropriate inthe case.   Nixon served 20 months of a five-year prison term for perjuryand was released from a halfway house 18 days after the Senateremoved him from office.   Nixon, 61, of Ocean Springs, Miss., is fighting a legal battleto resume practicing law. His law license has been suspended.</TEXT></DOC>
