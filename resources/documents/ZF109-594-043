Vetter, executive director of the Commission on Professionals in Scienceand technology in Washington, DC, while the number of bachelor's and master'sdegrees in computer science are dropping steadily for both men and women,degrees awarded to women are dropping faster, so they are becomming a smallerand smaller proportion of the total.andP;  Bachelor's degrees peacked at 35.7% in1986, masters also peaked that year at 29.9%, and both are expected tocontinue to decline.andP;  &quot;We have expected the numbers to drop for both, due todemographics such as fewer college students,&quot; says Vetter, &quot;but degreesawarded women are declining long before reaching parity.&quot;andP;  (See Table I.)andO;Vetter also would have expected computer science to be &quot;a great field forwomen,&quot; as undergraduate mathematics has been; female math majors have earned45% of bachelor's degrees during the 1980s.andP;  On the other hand, math Ph.andO;D.'s awarded to women have gone from only 15.5% to 18.1% in this decade,which is more in line with computer science Ph.D.'s earned by women.andP;  In1987, 14.4% of all computer science Ph.D's went to women; this numberdeclined to 10.9% the following year.andP;  Although the number almost doubledbetween 1988 and 1989 with women receiving 17.5% of Ph.D's, Vetter points outthat the number remains very small, at 107.andP;  Since these figures includeforeign students who are principally male, women constitute a smallerpercentage of that total than they do of Ph.D's awarded to Americans.andP;  Butwhile American women received 21.4% of Ph.D's awarded to Americans, that isnot encouraging either, says Vetter.andP;  Again, the number of American womenawarded computer science Ph.D.'s was minuscule, at 72.andP;  And taking a longerview, the awarding of significantly fewer bachelor's and master's degrees towomen in the late 1980s will be felt in seven to eight years, when they wouldbe expected to receive their Ph.D.'s.andM;How do these figures compare with those of other sciences and engineering?andO;In her 1989 report to the National Science Foundation, &quot;Women and ComputerScience,&quot; Nancy Leveson, associate professor of information and computerscience at the University of California at Irvine, reports that in 1986,women earned only 12% of computer science doctorates compared to 30% of alldoctorates awarded to women in the sciences.andP;  Leveson notes, however, thatthis includes the social sciences and phychology, which have percentages ashigh as 32 to 50.andP;  But the breakout for other fields is as follows: physicalsciences (16.4%), math (16.6%), eletrical engineering (4.9%), and otherengineering ranges from 0.8% for aeronautical to 13.9% for industrial.andM;Those women who do get computer science degrees ae not pursuing careers inacademic computer scinces.andP;  Leveson says women are either not being offeredor are not accepting faculty positions, or are dropping out of the facultyranks.andP;  Looking at data taken from the 1988-89 Taulbee Survey, which appearedin Communications in September, Leveson points out that of the 158 computerscience and computer engineering departments in that survey, 6.5 percent ofthe faculty are female.andP;  One third of the departments have no female facultyat all.andP;  (See Tables III and IV.)andM;Regarding women in computing in the labor force, Vetter comments that thestatistics are very soft.andP;  The Bureau of Labor Statistics asks companies forinformation on their workforce, and the NSF asks individuals for theirprofessional identification; therefore estimates vary.andP;  Table II shows thatthis year, women comprise about 35% of computer scientists in industry.andP;  Andaccording to a 1988 NSF report on women and minorities, although womenrepresents 49% of all professionals, they make up only 30% of employedcomputer scientists.andP;  &quot;There is no reason whey women should not make up halfthe labor force in computing,&quot; Betty Vetter says, &quot;It's not as if computinginvolves lifting 125 pound weights.&quot;andM;The sense of isolation and need for a community was so keen among women incomputing, that in 1987 several specialists in operating systems createdtheir own private forum and electronic mailing list called &quot;Systers.&quot;andO;Founded and operated by Anita Borg, member of the research staff at DEC'sWestern Research Lab, Systers consists of over 350 women representing manyfields within computing.andP;  They represent 43 companies and 55 universitiesprimarily in the United States, but with a few in Canada, the United Kingdom,and France.andP;  Industry members are senior level and come from every majorresearch lab.andP;  University members range from computer science undergraduatesto department chairs.andP;  Says Borg, &quot;Systers' purpose is to be a forum fordiscussion of both the problems and joys of women in our field and to providea medium for networking and mentoring.&quot;andP;  The network prevents these women,who are few and dispersed, from feeling that they alone experience certainproblems.andP;  Says Borg, &quot;You can spit out what you want with this group and getwomen's perspectives back.andP;  You get a sense of community.&quot;andP;  It is sexist tohave an all-women's forum?andP;  &quot;Absolutely not,&quot; says Borg, &quot;It's absolutelynecessary.andP;  We didn't want to include men because there is different way thatwomen talk when they're talking with other women, whether it be in person orover the net.andP;  Knowing that we are all women is very important.&quot;andO;(Professional women in computer science who are interested in the Systersmailing list may send email to systers-request@decwrl.dec.com)andM;The burden from women in computing seems to be very heavy indeed.andO;Investigators in gender-related research, and women themselves, say femalesexperience cumulative disadvantages from grade school through graduate schooland beyond.andP;  Because statistical studies frequently come under fire and donot always explain the entire picture, it is important to listen to how womenthemselves tell their story.andP;  In the Sidebar entitled &quot;Graduate School in theEarly 80s,&quot; women describe experiences of invisibility, patronizing behavior,doubted qualifications, and so on.andP;  Given these experiences, it is notsurprising that many women find the academic climate inclement.andP;  But whilemore women may choose to contribute to research in industry, is the computerbusiness really a haven for women, or just the only alternative?andP;  In theSidebar entitled &quot;The Workplace in the late '80s,&quot; women in industry alsotell their story and describe dilemmas in a dialogue on academia versusindustry; this discussion erupted freely last Spring on Systers.andP;  Inaddition, findings of scholars conducting gender-related research arepresented in a report of a workshop on women and computing.andP;  Finally,Communications presents &quot;Becoming a Computer Scientist: A Report by the ACMCommittee on the Status of Women in Computer Science.&quot;andP;  A draft was presentedat the workshop and the report appears in its entirety in this issue.andM;Report on a MeetingandM;To probe further into the reasons why girls and women are not pursuingcomputing in the same numbers as boys and men, and to recommend ways toreverse this trend, a workshop was held at the National Educational ComputingConference last June.andP;  This year, this influential and decade-old conferencedrew 2,414 authorities in computing and education and 1,500 people fromindustry.andP;  Entitled &quot;In Search of Gender-Free Paradigms for Computer ScienceEducation,&quot; the workshop was organized and chaired by C. Dianne Martin, anassistant professor at George Washington University's Electrical Engineeringand Computer Science department.andP;  It's specific goal was to examine thepremise that the decline in the number of women selecting computer sciencemajors can be attributed to a male-oriented paradigm in the field.andP;  Martininvited 12 scholars (See Workshop Participants, p.) conducting gender-relatedresearch in computer science education to present their latest findings andto participate in brainstorming sessions that resulted in recommendations.andO;Hightlights of the day-long workshop follow.andM;In her opening statement, Martin noted that many researchers observe that thecomputer culture is uncomfortable for girls and women.andP;  They are ill at easein a field that seems to encourage &quot;highly focused, almost obsessivebehavior,&quot; as the key to success she said, summarizing comments by EricRoberts at a recent Washington student society (Pugwash) meeting.andP;  She alsoalluded to perceived sex biases in the profession, citing two recent nationalstatistical studies of female engineering students engineering students byEleonor Baum, Dean of the School of Engineering at Cooper Union.andP;  Baum'sinvestigations showed that 70% of women felt they had to work harder thantheir male counterparts to get comparable pay, 58% felt that harassment ofsome sort was prevalent in the workplace, 50% felt that they viewed ethicalissues differently than did their male counterparts, 39% felt they would bepenalized if they took maternity leave, and a whopping 78% felt they receivedcomparable pay when they started, but were not promoted as rapidly.andP;  A third,independent study supported the last belief; while women started out withcomparable pay, within 10 years they were 25% behind their male counterparts.andO;(Businessweek 8/28/89)andM;Chaos In ComputerandM;ClassroomsandM;Lesley S. Klein, instructor of information systems at Pace University and acomputer science teacher in middle school and high school, described thechaotic state of computer science education throughout pre-college levels.andO;Working under the auspices of the Board of Cooperative Educational Services,funded by New York State Department of Education, Klein observes upper middleincome schools of this public school system.andP;  Despit its relative wealth,there is often a low budget for computer science and no curriculum, she said.andO;Computing is taught by teachers' aides or by media center administrators whohave had in-service training.andP;  &quot;Occasionally students are fortunate to have aclassroom teacher who has an interest in computers as a hobby or has takensome computer education courses,&quot; Klein reports in her paper, &quot;FemaleStudents' Under-achievement in Computer Science and Mathematics: Reasons andRecommendations.&quot;andP;  &quot;Some more adventurous teachers have incorporated LOGO orLego Logo programming into the curriculum, but there is no apparent formalplan nor carryover from one grade level to the next,&quot; Klwin continues.andP;  Thereare neither goals nor minimum standards established for both teacher trainingand the material to be covered.andP;  Not until the seventh and eight grades doesthe study of computers, logic, or BASIC programming emerge.andP;  PASCAL and Cprogramming and introductions to data processing are offered in secondaryschools, but there is still great variation in instructors' backgrounds andlevels of competence.andP;  Some are math teachers, have master's degrees incomputer science, or have taken graduate courses, but others are industrialarts teachers who have received minimal training.andP;  On the other hand,sometimes industrial arts teachers are better qualified than math teachers.andO;Although high school curricula for computer literacy and computer sciencecourses do exists (ACM made several recommendations on curricula five yearsago and plans to revise them by 1991) there is little support to implementthem and there is no uniformity from state to state.andM;But one would expect this sorry state of affairs to affect boys and girlsequally.andP;  Not so.andP;  According to Klein, girls &quot;demonstrate more insecurity andlack of self-confidence in math and science during transition periods&quot; likeentering middle school and entering high school.andP;  In middle school, forexample, boys use pirated software, she says, and the girls follow the schoolrules and are in the boys' way.andP;  &quot;The computers are always consumed by theboys who rush in, desperate to continue where they left off the day before inOregon Trail, Karateka, or Carmen San Diego.andP;  An occasional girl wanders in,but would practically need interference from the heavens to gain access tothese monopolized computers,&quot; Klein says.andP;  Given these different styles ofbehavior, Klein sees the need for a formal computer science curriculum forgrades seven through twelve as well as mandatory requirement that every highschool student take an introduction to computer science.andP;  Because many in theeducational community are unaware that recommended curricula exist, Kleinstresses the need for support for the distribution and implementation ofcurricula.andP;  In addition, there should be more uniform teacher training thatimproves computer skills and lesson presentation while &quot;specificallyaddressing the motivation of female students.&quot;andM;Women and Girls of ColorandM;The problems in computer science education for girls in well-to-do schoolsare substantial, but they are mild in comparison to those that girls fromminority groups face in their schools.andP;  Carol E. Edwards, of the SouthernCoalition for Educational Equity, Atlanta, Georgia, addressed theimplications of the computer culture for girls and women of color.andP;  As thedirector of Project Micro, Edwards runs a program devoted to making personalcomputers available to minority children and to using those computers toteach higher-order thinking skills.andP;  The educational opportunities for thesewomen and girls are so poor, she said, that they amount to racial, ethnic,and class discrimination.andP;  Both boys and girls of color go to schools withlow teacher expectations, more substitute teachers, less experiencedteachers, and frequent relegation to lower educational tracks.andP;  In math, forexample, girls of color are disproportionately represented on slower tracks.andM;Tracking itself is part of systemic problems in minority schools; it is anexample of structural practices that remain instituted even though they havebeen shown to benefit only the top one % of students, Edwards said.andP;  Besidesthese educational barriers, both boys and girls of color face culturalbarriers such as lack of role models and lack of parental encouragement.andO;They lack science-related opportunities and often never see computers.andP;  Butif they do use computers, they are not likely to stay after school in thecomputer lab.andP;  That is seen as scholarly and boys of color measureself-esteem in nonacademic ways, she said.andP;  Girls are unlikely to stay afterschool because they are usually responsible for younger siblings at home.andO;These barriers lead to disadvantages that are cumulative; the combination ofbeing poor, a member of a minority, and female lowers perceptions andattitudes toward math and computers proportional to the level ofdisadvantage, she said.andM;Sex-Blased SoftwareandM;Any computer science curriculum, whether implemented in a wealthy ordisadvantaged school must involve the selection of software.andP;  But studiesshow sex bias in educational software.andP;  In an effort to understand why thecomouter &quot;is more alluring to boys than it is to girls,&quot; Charles W. Huff andJoel Cooper have found sex biases due to the stereotypes of softwaredesigners.andP;  Huff, who was with Carnegie-Mellon University during thisresearch and is now an assistant professor of psychology at St. Olaf College,Northfield, MN, briefly presented their findings to the workshop.andP;  Becausetheir results are far-reaching and possibly related to software use in theworkplace, Huff's comments as well as those from an interview with Cooper,chairman of Princeton University's Department of Psychology, are presentedhere.andM;Beginning with sex differences in the impact of television violence onchildren, Cooper is the author of many gender-related studies and hascollaborated with other researchers (including Joan Hall, Lori Nelson, DianeMackie, all from Princeton, and Gita Wilder of the Educational TestingService).andP;  Although the media has reported the general conclusion thattelevised violence makes children act more aggressively, on closer inspectionof the data Cooper found this &quot;true almost exclusively for boys, not girls.&quot;andO;Most investigators stopped studying girls because the early data showed noeffect so as they proceeded with their research they used only males.andP;  &quot;It isan important observation that boys become more aggressive when they watchtelevision, but it should be equally interesting that girls don't, Coopersays.andP;  He and his collegues wondered whether the difference was due todifferent processes in males and females or to a predominance of male TVheroes and villains.andP;  They also decided to investigate the impact ofaggression via other media, particularly video games and middle schoolchildren.andP;  At that time, the early 1980s, graphics were so primitive thatcharacters were neither male nor female.andP;  This allowed the researchers tointroduce aggressive and nonaggressive video games without concern for thesex of the protagonists and antogonists.andP;  In that study, girls who playedaggressive video games became more aggressive than boys did.andP;  Says Cooper,&quot;the impact was greater on girls that on boys.&quot;andP;  But Cooper also observedthat when they told the children they were going to play a video game likeMissile Command, the boys got very excited but the girls were unenthusiastic.andO;They said either &quot;I don't want to play that,&quot; &quot;I can't play that,&quot; or &quot;I'mnot good at that.&quot;andP;  In fact, the girls were quite good at playing such games.andO;&quot;They were just as good at it as the boys were,&quot; said Cooper, &quot;But what theywere telling us was quite significant.andP;  They were saying, 'This makes mevery, very nervous, especially to do it in front of you.'&quot;andM;In another classroom in the same school, computerized learning had just begunwith educational software having a metaphor much like Missile Command.andP;  &quot;Inorder to motivate kids, educators were using a metaphor or fantasy that ourresearch showed was extremely exciting for boys and anxiety producing forgirls,&quot; Cooper explains.andP;  Next, he and Huff &quot;hypothesized that theexpectations software designers hold about the users of software they designare central in determining the way the user and the software interact.&quot;andM;To test this social psychological model--that expectations of one personabout another can shape their interaction--Huff and Cooper asked educatorswith programming experience to design software for either boys, girls, orstudents.andP;  The programs for both boys and students were the most game-likewhereas those intended for girls were classifiable as learning tools.andO;&quot;Programs written for students are written, it seems, with only boys inmind,&quot; Huff and Cooper Cooper write in &quot;Sex Bias in Educational software: TheEffect of Designers' Stereotypes on the Software They Design.&quot;andP;  &quot;...That is,[male and female designers] may have been simply using &quot;male&quot; as the defaultvalue of &quot;student.&quot;andP;  Therefore, &quot;It is not the computer, or even thesoftware, that is at the root of the sex bias in software, but theexpectations and stereotypes of the designers of the software,&quot; Huff andCooper conclude.andM;One obvious implication of this male bias is that educational software may bedesigned to appeal to boys &quot;without consideration of the effect on girls'motivation to use them or on girls' educational profit from them.andP;  Thiscertainly cannot be a good thing.&quot;andP;  Children using software designed for theopposite sex are more anxious after they interact with the program, and thatanxiety leads to lowered scores in the subject the program was intended toteach.andP;  &quot;However, this only occurs if the children are using the program inpublic, that is, in a computer lab with other chilren present,&quot; say theauthors.&quot;andP;  When theprograms are used privately, these differences do notemerge.&quot;andP;  Huff and Cooper conclude that not only is the softwaresex-stereotyped due to designers' expectations, but that the situation inwhich the software is presented is at fault.andM;Challenging Dijkstra:andM;Software Packages vs.andM;ProceduralandM;Programming?andM;One exploratory idea proposed by Danielle Bernstein, associate professor ofcomputer science at Kean College, Union, NJ, was a new curriculum paradigmfor computer science education--using software packages instead of proceduralprogramming as an introduction to computer science.andP;  She has designed andtaught an advanced course, &quot;Conceptual Understanding of Software Packages,&quot;which requires previous computing knowledge but which illustrates thatpackages &quot;have a place&quot; in computer science education.andP;  Her next step is todesign a course introducing computer science fundamentals with packages.andM;According to Bernstein, researchers have shown that previous experience,feelings of self-efficacy, and mathematically ability, are major predictorsof success in computer science courses.andP;  Defining self-efficacy as &quot;thefeeling that one is in control of the machine and can make a difference inthe operation of the machine,&quot; Bernstein said that this factor, which differsbetween men and women, may cause women's lower level of achievement incomputing.andP;  Previous experience often leads to feelings of self-efficacy, shesaid, and much of that experience results from self-initiated investigationsoutside of classes.andP;  &quot;However can we offer women the same experience?&quot; sheasked.andP;  Again, citing other researchers, she noted that while men may bepassionate about computers, women use computers as tools for solvingproblems.andP;  When women do not see computers as efficient tools, they loseinterest, but when both sexes see computers as tools, they perform equallywell.andP;  But given the current computer science curriculum including BASIC,Pascal, and the emphasis on step-by-step division of functions, and formalplanning in formal languages, women lose interest, she said.andM;Arguing for her new approach, Bernstein said that software packages are lesstied to mathematics and allow students to do something functional quickly.andO;Because software packages &quot;do real work real soon,&quot; she said, &quot;women, whoperceive computers as tools rather than toys, would see the purpose ofcomputer.&quot;andP;  Initial success and accomplishing work bring immediategratification; exploration is easier and more natural, and mistakes are lesscostly and visible with databases.andP;  Group work, which women prefer, occursmore spontaneously with packages, Bernstein added.andM;But is this computer science?andP;  Yes, according to Bernstein.andP;  Softwarepackages can provide a superior introduction to computer science compared toprocedural languages.andP;  Teaching sophisticated applications can illustrate andreinforce computer concepts like files, records, fields, memory, secondarystorage, Boolean operations, and the format versus content of variables, shesaid.andP;  Packages involve data structures, word processing deals with stringdata, and spreadsheets have implied structures.andP;  In database managementsystems, the user actually defines the data structure, whereas with Cobal andPascal the data structures are contained in the programs.andP;  &quot;These topics(files, records, etc.) can be examined without the overhead of extensiveprogram planning or syntax problems that can get in the way for a beginner,&quot;said Bernstein.andP;  &quot;Students may then be able to transfer these concepts toprocedural programming successfully.&quot;andM;Referring to a debate on teaching computer science, which appeared in theDecember 1989 issue of this publication, and specifically to EdsgerDijkstra's article, &quot;On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computing Science,&quot;Bernstein challenged his proposal to turn an introdutory programming courseinto one on formal mathematics.andP;  Such a course would use an unimplementedprogramming language &quot;so that students are protected from the temptation totest their programs,&quot; she said, quoting Dijkstra.andP;  Bernstein disagrees withthis approach because it would discourage those who wan to &quot;see, tinker,experiment, and interact&quot; with computers in order to understand principles.andO;And so, she says, Dijkstra's approach would cause computer science majors tofurther dwindle.andM;In concluding her paper, Bernstein wrote: &quot;The teaching of software conceptshas parallel the advances in software development.andP;  Each time functionalsoftware has gotten further away from the details of the hardware, there hasbeen a cry that computer science is being watered down.andP;  But each step hasencouraged more diverse people to deal with computers.andP;  Serious conceptualunderstanding of application packages will continue this trend.&quot;andP;  At theworkshop, she stated, &quot;To me, (Dijkstra's approach) means, 'Computer scienceis getting too easy.andP;  Let's keep the riff-raff out.'&quot;andM;Academia vs.andP;  IndustryandM;Thos women with an interest in computer science who do begin preparing foradvanced degrees face enormous barriers, according to Henry Etzkowitz,associate professor of sociology at SUNY Purchase and visiting scientist atColumbia University's Computer Science Department.andP;  Funded by the NSF, hisstudy, co-authored by Carol Kemelgor and Michael Neuschatz, is titled &quot;TheFinal Disadvantage: Barriers to Women in Academic Science and Engineering.&quot;andO;The study encompasses women in computer science, electrical engineering,chemistry and physics.andP;  At a leading research university 350 students and 76dropouts were identified; they and their faculty were inteviewed; and datawere collected from academic records to determine the receptivity of theircultures to women graduate students and faculty.andP;  &quot;Our specific aim was todetermine whether national background of faculty members was associated withbias toward women graduate students,&quot; said Etzkowitz.andP;  He found that whilefewer women had nonwestern faculty advisors, those who did reported less biastoward women as scientists.andP;  This was particularly true when the facultyadvisors were Chinese and Indian.andP;  For these faculty, women clearly heldsecondary social status, yet sexual identity was viewed as separate fromwork, Etzkowitz explained.andP;  &quot;This separation allowed them to view women asscientists without confusion among sexual identity, occupational, and socialstatus.&quot;andP;  Male faculty members from Mediterranean and Middle Easterncountries, on the other hand, were most often reported to be prejudicedagainst women.andP;  Etzkowitz also found &quot;sexual separation of scientists,&quot; thatis, certain areas of science are labelled as peculiarly male or female, whichleads both sexes to avoid certain areas.andP;  Computer science theory, forexample, is de facto off limits to women, in much the same way as particlephysics.andP;  But natural language is assumed by some male faculty to be moresuited to women because it is closer to traditional sex and work roles--likewomen's &quot;traditional expressive role and typing skills in software.&quot;andM;Etzkowitz found mismatched expectations between make faculty members andfemale graduate students; female students want to be taught the strategiesneeded to compete and bolster self-confidence, which male faculty presumemeans wanting &quot;explicit direction in the conduct of research.&quot;andP;  These facultythought female students wanted to do it, whereas the students how to do it,whereas the students reported that they wanted &quot;guidance on how to succeed inthe profession.&quot;andM;Female students in computer science reported both overt and subtlediscrimination with &quot;acute consequences,&quot; said Etzkowitz.andP;  Theirself-confidence, ability to perform, and career advancement suffered.andP;  Notsurprisingly, women seek out female faculty.andP;  But unlike men, who sign upwith a female faculty member only after she has distinguished herself in thefield, female students sign up because they want a sympathetic mentor.andP;  Onesolution found by electrical engineering female graduate students was toundertake research in industry, where they were often able to find womenmentors.andM;Another factor pushing women from academia to industry is the &quot;tenure clockversus the biological clock.&quot;andP;  One woman in Etzkowitz's study went to workfor IBM immediately upon graduating and did not even consider getting a Ph.D.andO;until after her chilren were born.andP;  For her, as for most women, the academicroute and tenure were incompatible with having a family.andP;  In computerscience, &quot;pregnancy is discouraged and graduate women who have children areencouraged to take leaves of absence that tend to become permanentwithdrawals.&quot;andP;  Women expect this and it creates anxiety.andP;  Once they havetheir degrees, going into academia part-time is infeasible and leaves ofabsence often result in permanent attrition.andP;  According to Etzkovitz, thesewomen find they must choose between two approaches: they can either followthe &quot;male model&quot; for success in academia, which demands driven, if notobsessive devotion before tenure, and the publish-or-perish pressures thatcan lead to exploiting as many students as possible.andP;  Or they can go intoindustry, where their jobs are more nine-to-five and it is a little easier tobalance their career and family needs.andP;  Relatively few women adopt the firstmodel and more adopt the second, he said.andM;Etzkowitz concluded that structural barriers could be reduced with thedevelopment of a critical mass of women faculty and graduate students incomputer science departments.andP;  He proposed changing the tenure structure toallow a more flexible timeclock and involving students and faculty in thefaculty-recruiting process.andP;  He suggested that aggressive intervention wasneeded on the part of funding agencies to ensure these changes.andM;RecommendationsandM;After the presentations, the workshop divided into working groups thatrecommended ways to expose, attract, and retain females in computing.andO;Valerie Clarke, a social psychologist at Deakin University, Australia, spokefor the exposure group, which focused on precollege computer experiences andopportunities.andP;  Although this group thought it should address the entirecurriculum through 12th grade, for practical purposes, it focused on middleschools only.andP;  This stage is crucial because from ages 11 to 14, &quot;children ofboth sexes tend to turn away from computers,&quot; Clarke said.andP;  &quot;Most children atthe primary level have an interest in computers, if given the opportunity,but in the middle school peer pressure tends to direct more girls away fromcomputers.&quot;andP;  In addition, at this age girls' preferences for working ingroups and their needs for demonstrated relevance are especially great.andM;The group stressed the need for a more ambitious, comprehensive curriculumthrough twelfth grade bearing in mind resources.andP;  &quot;It's fairly useless todevise a curriculum that assumes you'll have one computer per two or threechildren when schools have nothing of the sort,&quot; said Clarke.andP;  Notinginadequate educational software and teacher training, Clarke said that as aresult many teachers may lack confidence and self-esteem.andP;  In turn, they fearthat their students know more than they do.andP;  So while it is very important toprovide teachers with curriculum that is not enough; measures must be takenbuild teachers' confidence so that they use the curriculum and feelsufficiently in control.andM;Alluding to studies indicating that a girl's potential depends to some extenton her mother's level of education, Clarke said we must address the moregeneral education of the public through advertising and the media.andP;  Good willand a first-class curriculum cannot counter mothers who want to withdrawtheir children from classes or even schools if their daughters do poorly incomputers, said Clarke.andM;As presented by Danielle Bernstein, the retention group noted that women anddisadvantaged groups, find computing courses more time-consuming than othercourses and feel they do not receive the right number of credits for thenumber of hours worked.andP;  &quot;They can get the same three credits for a marketingcourse, where they just read a book and understand it,&quot; she explained.andP;  Andchemistry and physics labs do not demand indefinite periods of time forproblem solving.andP;  To motivate these credit- and time-conscious students, thegroup suggested structured labs with exercises that can be finished beforeleaving class.andP;  Such labs could also reduce the computer culture brand ofcompetitiveness that arises when people brag about the many hours they havespent on a system in order to get the best solution.andM;Looking at how students are taught to write code, this group suggestedencouraging students to read programs.andP;  To learn most subjects, especiallyforeign languages, students do not just write, they also learn how to read,said Bernstein.andP;  &quot;Computing seems to be the only subject where we teachpeople how to write without giving them any kind of mental model.andP;  A betterway is [to include] reading programs,&quot; Bernstein said.andM;This group also addressed computer access.andP;  Since students perform better inprivate, the group sought ways to help all students afford their owncomputers for use in dorm rooms.andP;  It was suggested that colleges bury theprice of computers in tuition so they would fall within expenses covered bystudent loans.andP;  Computers in dorm rooms would also give each student a senseof control; the student alone would know and have access to his or her harddisc's contents, for example.andP;  &quot;When you control the environment, you havemore self-confidence.andP;  Otherwise it's like cooking in somebody else'skitchen; you don't know where anything is,&quot; Bernstein said.andM;To encourage high school students to pursue computing in college, the grouprecommended that college computer science departments &quot;adopt&quot; high schools.andO;Also suggested was cascading pairing; graduate students would pair up withcollege students, college students with high school students, and so on.andO;This cascading effect at lower levels would decrease dependence on thosefemale computer science professors who are role models, said Bernstein.andM;Industry should also provide role models: there should be a large-scaleprogram for guest lecturers from industry to speak to high school students.andO;In addition, industry should bring in not just college but high schoolstudents to work on projects.andP;  To attract industry employees and prevent themfrom regarding this as mandatory drudge work that siphons time away fromtheir jobs, the group recommended that companies be responsible for rewardssystems, but did not specify what kinds.andM;To widen students' perspectives on career choices, the group suggestedinviting not just alumnae who had been A+ students, but those who got Bs andCs.andP;  Through their visits, the current student body would learn that manypeople with less-than-perfect academic records are very successful in the jobmarket, Bernstein said.andP;  Dianne Martin then commented, &quot;We will know we havearrived when it's OK for women to get Cs in science, math, engineering, andcomputer science.andP;  Right now, if you're not an A or B student, you don't eventhink of going into those fields.&quot;andP;  The women currently in the field are thehigh achievers only, she said.andP;  &quot;We're not reaching the middle and averageachievers.andP;  Yet there are average-achieving men going into those fields.&quot;andM;Adding to that group's recommendations, Carol Edwards called for morefinancial aid, particularly in the form of grants.andP;  &quot;When Reagan switchedfrom grants to loans, it hurt the poorest people.andP;  It didn't hurt the peoplethat he said were using the money to buy stereos when they go to college,&quot;she said.andP;  The poorest people--women of color who might have smallchildren--just did not see themselves going into that much debt and beingable in the end to pay it off, she said.andP;  Edwards also called for tenure andpromotion for superior teaching.andP;  &quot;Just as we have people who at this pointget tenure because of their research,&quot; she said, &quot;we also have to look atsuperior teaching as a criterion for the tenure track.&quot;andM;In his summary of the attraction workgroup's recommendations, Robin Kayechoed the need for parent education.andP;  We see stereotyping in the kinds oftoys parents encourage their children to play with, and parents often assumethat little boys should have more access to computers.andP;  &quot;Parents are moreinclined to buy boys computers, and if you have a computer at home whenyou're young, you get used to it.&quot;andP;  To ensure that girls are not excluded, weshould encourage the tool approach to computers, he said.andP;  The advent ofmicrocomputers allows this now because, unlike the late '70s and early '80swhen you had to know programming in order to use computers, with personalcomputers &quot;we have become more individualistic.andP;  You can do lots moretool-oriented [tasks] with computers and you don't need to program.&quot;andM;And finally, regarding sex biases in software, Kay commented that companiesbelieve their market is male.andP;  Further, they think that if they startadvertising to females, they may discourage the males, Kay said.andP;  Hesuggested trying to convince companies that there is a viable female marketthey are cutting off.andP;  &quot;If they accept that, they'll think they can make moremoney.andP;  Money does make things happen.&quot;andM;In closing, Martin commented that the &quot;most astounding two words today were'cumulative disadvantage.'&quot;  They indicate priorities as to where energy andresources should be allocated.andP;  &quot;It turns out, that if you're a woman, andyou're poor, and you're a minority, the disadvantage is cumulative.andP;  That'swhere we have to put cumulative resources.andP;  The research shows, without adoubt, that there is this cumulative effect.&quot;andM;If the issues discussed here are not addressed, everyone stands to lose.andP;  Theprofession could find itself asking uncomfortable questions too late in thegame.andP;  As it is, one wonders how many ideas, that could have been contributedby female talent, will never surface to enrich academic computer science.andO;More broadly, what are the repercussions to our increasinglycomputer-oriented society, if women--about half the population andprofessional workforce--are not as prepared in this discipline as are men?andO;Perhaps we will not have to find out.andM;Workshop ParticipantsandM;Unless otherwise indicated, papers based on workshop presentations are as yetunpublished.andM;Chair:andM;C.andP;
