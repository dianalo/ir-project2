June delivery gold was down $5.40 an ounce to $447.20, while July silver declined 15 cents an ounce to $6.435 and platinum for July delivery was off $6.60 an ounce to $518.50.    The major influence, analysts agreed, was the failure of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, after four days of meetings, to come to agreement with non-OPEC nations on a means to cut oil production and to support prices. Consequently, crude oil prices declined, removing a potential inflation factor that could have strengthened precious metals prices.    London markets were closed for a holiday, which made the U.S. markets here somewhat thin and susceptible to selling, one analyst observed.    Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisors Inc. a consulting firm, said that with the precious metals markets already depressed, &quot;any kind of negative news has a multiplier effect, while positive developments are brushed off.&quot;    Precious metals prices haven't risen despite the recent Persian Gulf hostilities and the possibility that OPEC might reach a price-supporting agreement with non-OPEC nations, he said.    He noted that an article in yesterday's Wall Street Journal caused pessimism among some precious metals people. &quot;The fact that the article dealt with price drops that could happen in precious metals in five years was ignored,&quot; he said. &quot;What impressed them was the negative thrust of the story.&quot;    William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York, observed that buying interest for physical gold, which had been strong recently, has waned.    &quot;There's very little buying interest in Europe, Taiwan hasn't bought gold in the past few weeks, and Japanese buying levels aren't what they used to be,&quot; he said.    Kevin Shinners, chief precious metals trader for Balfour Maclaine International Ltd., New York, said he thinks precious metal prices may be headed still lower. &quot;The dollar may be in for a rising trend, for no reason other than it hung around for 2 1/2 weeks doing nothing,&quot; he said.    But Bette Raptopoulos, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York, saw a bit of bullishness for precious metals. &quot;Crude oil prices may have reached their lows and could begin to show some improvement in the next few days,&quot; she said. &quot;If this happens, some support could be communicated to precious metals.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Speculation about dry planting conditions continued to dominate corn and soybean futures prices, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. Corn futures prices rose while soybean futures prices closed mostly unchanged from a big rise Friday, which had pushed many contracts near their highest prices. Soybean futures prices are especially sensitive to weather conditions this spring because U.S. stockpiles are falling. According to private weather forecasters, the dry weather is centered in the western one-third of the corn and soybean belt. In Iowa, subsoil moisture has been significantly below last year's levels. Wheat futures prices dropped yesterday in the wake of reports of weekend rains in Canada and the Northern Plains states.    SUGAR: Futures prices tumbled on a report that Cuba will produce more sugar than in recent years. The July delivery contract fell 0.39 cent a pound to 8.12 cents, just above the low of the day. The London market was closed for a holiday, which made the New York market subject to technical selling, one analyst noted. A report from the Dominican Republic, which was carried by various news wires, said that a U.S. agricultural official in Santo Domingo estimated the Cuban sugar crop this year will top the 7.2 million metric tons produced in each of the past two years. The official said that Cuban sugar mills were working at 87% of capacity, which is higher than analysts and other observers had anticipated in previously estimating that output would about match that of the previous two crops. One analyst observed further that there was little demand for sugar on the world market and that sugar would remain under pressure unless demand appears or there are production problems.    COTTON: Futures prices rose for cotton to be delivered from the new crop, which starts Aug. 1. Weather problems in California growing areas were the main factor. October delivery cotton rose 0.93 cent a pound to 58.36 cents. The July contract, the only one left representing the 1987-88 crop, wasn't affected by the news and declined 0.1 cent. Extremely windy weather in California has uprooted cotton seedlings and some replanting may be necessary, said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York. Planting began at the end of March and the beginning of April. </TEXT></DOC>
