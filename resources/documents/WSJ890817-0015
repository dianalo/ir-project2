Guilty pleas to a variety of criminal charges were entered in U.S. district court in Seattle, where the U.S. attorney's office is leading a nationwide government task force that's looking into counterfeit aircraft components.    Criminal charges were also filed yesterday against three others as a result of the probe, which is centering on the manufacturers and suppliers of aerospace fasteners -- essentially high-tech nuts and bolts that hold planes together. The investigation received widespread attention in February when it was learned that a unit of Fairchild Industries Inc. had been raided by the task force.    Attorneys for Rice Aircraft, based in Hauppauge, N.Y., stressed -- and government prosecutors acknowledged -- that there appears to be no threat to air safety because of the company's actions. But Bruce Carter, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, said Rice's conduct &quot;really subverts the technical integrity of the aerospace industry.&quot;    Rice Aircraft distributed fasteners to a broad range of airplane builders -- &quot;a virtual Who's Who of international aerospace,&quot; Mr. Carter termed the list, which includes the Israeli government, Airbus Industrie, Boeing Co., Grumman Corp., Martin Marietta Corp. and a number of airlines. Court records show that some of the parts were purchased for military aircraft, such as the F-111 and F-14 fighters and the B-1B bomber.    Bruce J. Rice, the company's 42-year-old president, confessed to paying off both vendors and customers in return for certain favors. For instance, he admitted giving a Grumman official up to $200 a week so business would be steered toward Rice Aircraft at the expense of its competitors.    He also admitted to giving &quot;kickbacks&quot; to a Boeing subsidiary manager in return for &quot;the last look&quot; at rivals' secret bids. Richard K. Ohlman, who worked for Rice Aircraft, was charged yesterday with being the middleman in the Boeing transactions. He declined to comment.    Yet at the heart of Rice Aircraft's illicit practices, according to court documents, was its procurement of surplus fasteners that it would strip, replate and turn around and sell as originals. &quot;It was like taking a Model-T and polishing it up to look like a 1989 Ford,&quot; Mr. Carter contended.    Records indicate, moreover, that the company paid fastener makers for test reports, arbitrarily assigning them to untested parts. Mr. Rice, according to his statement of admission, &quot;then knowingly used these test reports to misrepresent to certain fastener&quot; buyers that the company's inventory could be traced to a properly inspected lot.    Mr. Rice faces up to five years in prison and has agreed to pay a fine and costs of prosecution of $500,000. In addition, he may be required to pay an additional fine of up to $250,000 and restitution of as much as $1 million. Rice Aircraft has agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and also faces a restitution claim of up to $1 million.    Despite pleading guilty, Mr. Rice's attorney insisted the only reason his client agreed to accept the charges was the threat by the U.S. attorney of invoking federal racketeering laws. Under them, he said, Mr. Rice's assets could have been frozen, &quot;preventing the defendants from hiring . . . counsel.&quot;    Dan Dubitzky, the lawyer, maintained that all the specific violations admitted to by Mr. Rice &quot;were technical&quot; or &quot;committed under duress.&quot; He said, for example, that Rice Aircraft made the wrongful payments &quot;in direct response to threats by employees of both customers and manufacturers&quot; to delay orders and otherwise disrupt service.    Apparently, those who received money from Rice Aircraft cooperated in the government's investigation and therefore won't be indicted.    Additional charges were filed yesterday in a separate, but generally related case. Two former Boeing employees, John J. Rockwood and Richard K. Watson, were accused of conspiring with Southeast Connectors Inc., Miami, to give that company a peek at bids made to Boeing by competitors. Neither man could be reached.    Southeast Connectors and two top executives were convicted last year of obtaining the bidding information from Messrs. Rockwood and Watson. </TEXT></DOC>
