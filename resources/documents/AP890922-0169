Roper's house in Charlotte was hit by a 60-foot oak.   The storm _ downgraded from hurricane status after it slammedCharleston, S.C., but still packing lethal wind and rain _ enteredNorth Carolina about 5 a.m. and exited about 11:50 a.m. intosouthwest Virginia and Tennessee.   ``There has been heavy wind damage and very heavy, torrentialrains along the path of the storm,'' said Gov. Jim Martin. ``Becausethe eye of the storm came ashore further south than we had expected,the coastal damage was not as severe as we had prepared for.''   A 6-month-old infant in Union County, just southeast ofCharlotte, was killed when a tree fell onto a house, hitting thebaby's crib, state emergency management spokesman Jeff Merritt said.   A 400-foot television transmission tower at WSOC in Charlottetoppled onto the station building.   State officials said drinking water may have been contaminated innine counties because of power outages.   Near the federal courthouse in Charlotte, where Jim Bakker'sfraud and conspiracy trial was postponed until Monday because of thestorm, the Mister Hot Dog restaurant was demolished.   ``It's all right; it's going to get better,'' proclaimed ownerJohn Bolick as he cleaned up buns and weiners.   Bill Pinson, who watched utility crews work on a ruptured watermain at his two-story home, which was hit by a large willow oak. Hesaid he had been so worried about his beach property at EdistoIsland near Charleston, S.C., that he ``didn't even think about thishouse.''   North Carolina's coast escaped Hurricane Hugo's wrath. Butresidents from Charlotte, on the South Carolina line, to AlleghanyCounty, which borders southwest Virginia, were't as lucky with thetropical storm.   At the height of the storm, roads and streams were choked withfloodwaters in hillier and mountainous section of the state.   ``It's raining so hard you can't see your hand in front of you,''said Alleghany County Deputy Sheriff Tim Blevins. ``The mainarteries into town are either full of water or full of trees.''   Duke Power Co. said 375,000 customers were without power in NorthCarolina and three South Carolina counties and could be out forseveral days. Carter said the outages affected 86 percent of DukePower's 230,000 customers in Charlotte, the state's largest city.   Blue Ridge Electric Membership Cooperative said 20,000 customerswere without power in three mountain counties near the Tennesseeline. Carolina Power andamp; Light Co. said 27,000 customers were in thedark in south-central North Carolina.   Tornadoes that spun off Hugo knocked trees onto power lines anddestroyed at least two mobile homes in the Blue Ridge foothills.   A wind speed of more than 80 mph was clocked atop a mountain nearthe resort town of Blowing Rock.   Several propane gas tanks _ weighing from 20 pounds to 500 pounds_ floated into the New River, said Boone Fire Chief Reggie Hessler.Some were leaking, but there was enough wind to keep fumes frompresenting a danger, he said.   In Fayetteville, the roof of a Days Inn motel blew onto the carsof people from South Carolina who had checked into the motel toescape the storm's wrath. A roof was blown off a warehouse inWhiteville.   Winds were clocked at 75 mph at Charlotte-Douglas InternationalAirport, where flights were canceled Friday morning. A gust to 90mph prompted evacuation of the control towert. Flights also werecanceled at Raleigh-Durham International Airport and coastalWilmington's New Hanover County Airport.   The weather service said the Outer Banks could experience erosionand tidal overwash because of the rough seas.</TEXT></DOC>
