A rifle barrel      14 aligned with the rifle bolt includes a gas port as is conventional with      such semi-automatic weapons as the &quot;AK-47&quot; or SKS type 56. </PAR><PAR>  Initially, in use of the organization, removal of a gas piston associated      with the semi-automatic actuation of the associated rifle is effected      along with the associated gas piston tube and upper forearm to effect and      permit the driving out of a retaining pin relative to an associated gas      diverter (not shown) of conventional knowledge relative to such rifles.      The gas port is directed through the associated rifle 14, with a gas port      blocking assembly 15 provided by the invention. The gas port blocking      assembly 15 includes a first bore 16 parallel to a second bore 17. The      first bore 16 receives the rifle barrel 14 therethrough and is positioned      above and overlying the associated gas port, as noted above. The blocking      assembly 15 includes a lock fastener 18 received within the lock fastener      bore 19 intersecting the first bore 16 to fixedly secure the assembly 15      relative to the rifle barrel 14. An actuator rod 20 is slidably received      through the second bore 17, with an actuator rod handle 21 mounted to the      actuator rod 20. A handle body 21a projects below an associated handle      bore 22 receiving the actuator rod 20 therethrough. Handle fasteners 23      directed into the handle 21 intersect the handle bore 22 to secure the      actuator rod 20 in an adjustable manner relative to the actuator rod 20.      An actuator rod rear distal end 24 is oriented relative to the rifle bolt      12, wherein a &quot;C&quot; bracket 25 receives the rifle bolt handle 13 between      spaced legs of the &quot;C&quot; bracket, wherein the &quot;C&quot; bracket includes coaxially      aligned &quot;C&quot; bracket bores 26 receiving the actuator rod rear distal end 24      therethrough, wherein an actuator rod lock fastener 27 mounted to the rear      distal end 24 when directed through the &quot;C&quot; bracket 25 for securement of      the actuator rod 20 relative to the associated rifle bolt handle 13. In      this manner, reciprocation of the actuator rod handle 21 effects      reciprocation of the associated bolt 12 for operation of the associated      rifle in a manual operation. </PAR><PAR>  A modified handle 28 is illustrated in the FIGS. 4 and 5, wherein a handle      body 30 projects downwardly relative to the handle bore 22, in a manner as      described above. A handle body first cavity 31 positioned adjacent the      handle bore 22 is positioned above a handle body second cavity 32. The      first cavity 31 and the second cavity 32 are divided by a handle web with      a rod 33 coaxially directed through the handle body second cavity 32, with      its upper distal end positioned within the first cavity 31 and a rod disc      34 fixedly mounted to the rod 33 within the first cavity 31, with the rod      disc 34 projecting exteriorly of the handle body 30. Upon rotation of the      rod disc 34, the externally threaded rod 33 is rotated, whereupon an      internally threaded piston plate 35 is thereby displaced relative to the      handle web. A camouflage paint compound 36 is positioned within the second      cavity 32 and is projected exteriorly through a lower distal end of the      handle body 30 upon projection of the piston plate 35 downwardly along the      rod 33 for use by an individual. </PAR><PAR>  A further modified handle 37 is illustrated in the FIGS. 6-8 to include a      gas chamber 39 positioned adjacent the handle bore 22, with a handle      chamber 40 extending from the gas chamber 39 downwardly through a lower      distal end or floor portion of the handle 37. An inner face web 41 divides      the gas chamber 39 relative to the handle chamber 40. A gas fill valve 42      effects pressurizing of the gas chamber 39. A canister insert 43 is      mounted within the handle chamber 40, with a canister insert floor 44      including a floor port 45 directed therethrough to permit projection of an      associated camouflage type viscous fluid from the canister insert 43, and      more specifically through the floor port 45. A canister valve 47 is      mounted within the canister insert top wall 46, with the canister valve 47      fixedly mounted to the top wall 46 and slidably directed through the inner      face web 41. A spring 48 captured between the inner face web 41 and the      top wall 46 normally biases the canister insert 43 downwardly. A first      canister valve port 49 normally biased and positioned within the inner      face hook 41 may be projected upwardly upon manual displacement of the      canister insert 43 upwardly by manually providing a force upon the      canister floor 44 upwardly into the handle chamber 40. In this manner, the      first canister valve ports 49 are thereby exposed directing pressurized      gas from the gas chamber 39 into the canister valve ports 49 and      thereafter into the second canister valve ports 50 pressurizing the      canister insert 43 therewithin projecting the viscous fluid 51 through the      floor port 45 for use by an individual. </PAR><PAR>  As to the manner of usage and operation of the instant invention, the same      should be apparent from the above disclosure, and accordingly no further      discussion relative to the manner of usage and operation of the instant      invention shall be provided. </PAR><PAR>  With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the      optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to      include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of      operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to      one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those      illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are      intended to be encompassed by the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the      principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and      changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired      to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and      described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may      be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed as being new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent      of the United States is as follows: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
