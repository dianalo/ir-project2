SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   America now has more than 245 millionresidents thanks to strong immigration and an increase in thenatural growth of the U.S. population, the Census Bureau says.   As of Jan. 1 the national population was 245,110,000, the bureausaid, up from 242,825,000 a year earlier.   The largest part of the increase was from natural growth _ 1.7million people. That resulted from 3.8 million births minus 2.1million deaths.   In addition there were an estimated 600,000 immigrant arrivals,the bureau said.   At 0.9 percent for the year, the overall increase is consistentwith long-term trends, the agency reported. The nation's populationhas been growing at about 1 percent annually since about 1960.   Births last year averaged 15.6 per 1,000 people, up from 15.4 in1986 but below the 15.7 rate of 1985.   While this is well above the all-time low of 14.5 recorded in1976, there has been no consistent trend in recent years.   Population experts note that the giant post World War II BabyBoom generation currently has produced many women in their primechildbearing ages, thus producing more potential mothers to raisethe birth rate.   Even so, the birth rate is nowhere near the high rate set in thewake of the World War II, when births climbed to a record 26.5 per1,000 in 1947.   Deaths occurred at a rate of 8.7 per 1,000 people, and have beenfluctuating in the 8.5 to 8.7 range since 1977 after declining from9.4 in 1972.   There were 2.5 net immigrants per 1,000 people, including anallowance for illegal arrivals, the bureau said. That's down from2.7 in 1986 and well below the 3.7 mark of 1980, highest sinceWorld War II.   The overall growth rate was 0.7 percent last year for whites and1.5 percent for blacks, both down substantially since 1960.</TEXT></DOC>
