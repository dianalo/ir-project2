The measure was approved by the Intelligence and Armed Servicescommittees, both meeting in closed-door sessions, after amendmentswere added that would permit the United States to shareintelligence information about Cuban military activities insouthern Africa and permit military cooperation with South Africaif the president determines such ties to be in the nationalinterest, committee aides said.   The bill, which still must clear two more committees before itcan go to the full House for action, would require U.S.disinvestment in South Africa within a year and ban most tradebetween the two countries.   As originally written, the bill also would have banned militaryand intelligence cooperation. But the two committees added languagecreating an exemption for diplomatic activities and intelligencesharing concerning Cuban activities in Angola, where U.S.-backedrebels are fighting the Marxist government.   Committee aides said the exemption was granted in part to avoidhaving the sanctions bill become a vehicle for a renewed debateover U.S. support for the Angolan rebels.   The Armed Services panel also approved an amendment by Rep. JonKyl, R-Ariz., permitting military cooperation if the presidentdeems it in the national interest.   Both committees reported the bill out on voice votes.   The measure still must clear the Ways and Means and Interiorcommittees before being considered by the full House, where it isexpected to pass. The measure is expected to have a tougher time inthe Senate, however, because it lacks the Republican support whichwas crucial to passage of a limited sanctions bill two years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
