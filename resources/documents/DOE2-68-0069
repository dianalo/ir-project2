Small scale hydro to support early local energy demands spreadthroughout the country where alternate energy sources, such as coal andoil, were not prevalent. Many hydro sites were constructed in the early1900's with an intended service life expectancy of forty to fifty years.Minimal maintenance was deemed adequate - as long as the equipment continuedto function, nominal power outputs were considered acceptable. Alternateenergy sources, such as oil, became so economically attractive that somehydro sites were retired from service. With renewed interest in hydro,many old sites are being rehabilitated to achieve maximum power outputand higher efficiencies. Rehabilitated plants are now performing at optimallevels, with higher availability and lower annual maintenance and operationalcosts. By employing today's hydro technology and computer-aided designs,existing hydro sites can be economically rehabilitated to achieve maximumperformance. This paper addresses typical Kaplan and Francis rehabilitations.</TEXT></DOC>
