With all the precincts tallied, the measure received 45,624 novotes, or 50.2 percent, and 45,255 yes votes, or 49.8 percent, amargin of just 369 against the referendum.   Voter turnout was reported to be light across the city.   ``I think everybody is out doing everything else,'' said MarkRupe, a precinct worker in east Dallas, said on Saturday afternoon.``Since it's on a Saturday, they have everything else on theirmind.   ``People might say, `Well, I really don't know what this is allabout,' and decide to go fishing,'' he said.   Supporters of the proposal to create single-member districts saythe plan would have helped ease racial inequities that make itdifficult for minorities to get elected.   Opponents say the referendum would resegregate Dallas. They backa plan voters approved last year that called for some candidates tobe elected by district, others by region and one at large.   Under the system instituted in 197, eight council members areelected in individual districts and another three, including themayor, are elected by voters citywide.   The system voters approved in August 1989 called for 10candidates to be chosen by district, four by region and one atlarge. But that system was never implemented because a federaljudge suggested he would rule it unconstitutional.   Saturday's referendum was held as part of the settlement of a1988 federal lawsuit brought by Roy Williams and Marvin Crenshaw,who failed in their at-large council bids. The men, both black,charged the existing election system made it difficult forminorities to win election.   Black and Hispanic leaders nationwide have long charged thatat-large elections dilute minority candidates' political power andmake it difficult for them to win office.   They maintain minorities have a better chance of winning officeunder a political system in which candidates are elected byindividual districts.   Although minorities are estimated to make up more than half thecity's population, only two of 11 City Council members are black.None are Hispanic.   Only one minority, a Hispanic who no longer serves on thecouncil, has won an at-large City Council election.   If the plan had been approved, a commission would have been setup to draw new district lines next year, using 1990 Census figures.   In the 1980 Census, Dallas' racial makeup consisited of 61percent white, 26 percent black and 12 percent Hispanic. But abreakdown of the 1990 Census of 982,250 people is expected to showa majority black and Hispanic population.</TEXT></DOC>
