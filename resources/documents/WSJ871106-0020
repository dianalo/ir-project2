The dollar began setting new lows at the outset of Asian trading and continued to tumble throughout the day, despite the West German central bank's move to lower some short-term interest rates. In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.6768 West German marks, down 1.6% from 1.7040 marks Wednesday, and at 135.18 Japanese yen, down 1.1% from 136.70 yen. At about noon EST, the dollar traded at a record low of 1.6680 marks and a 40-year low of 134.60 yen.    In Tokyo trading Friday, the dollar began to rebound modestly after Bank of Japan intervention totaling as much as $300 million in the first hour of trading. On Friday, the dollar opened at 134.70 yen, down from 135.95 yen at the close of Tokyo trading Thursday. By midday, the dollar had recovered somewhat and was quoted at 134.80 yen.    Fueling the dollar's drop Thursday were remarks by Treasury Secretary James Baker, who said the U.S. will stress lower interest rates in order to prevent a recession, even at the risk of a falling dollar. His comments, made in an interview published in The Wall Street Journal yesterday, were affirmed by the White House.    Mr. Baker's remarks confirmed widespread assumptions in the foreign exchange markets that threw the dollar into a sharp decline two weeks ago. But the Baker interview unleashed a flood of dollar selling that left currency markets at times disorderly, traders said.    &quot;To have it stated in black and white in your morning newspaper leaves you with no doubt at all&quot; about administration policy, Trevor W. Woodland, vice president, foreign exchange, at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said. &quot;It would be a brave man to fight the {downward} trend,&quot; he said.    Among major trading currencies, the dollar's drop yesterday was most severe against the Swiss franc. The dollar fell 1.8%, to 1.3793 francs from 1.4050 francs Wednesday. Dealers said the Swiss franc benefited from a &quot;flight to quality&quot; as investors abandoned the dollar and gold prices fell. Gold is often viewed as an alternative to dollar investments.    The dollar failed to show any favorable response to the Bundesbank's agreement to cut its rate on securities-repurchase agreements to 3.5% from 3.8% and in its Lombard rate cut to 4.5% from 5%.    The repurchase agreements are an important short-term refinancing facility for West German banks under which they borrow funds from the central bank using securities as collateral. The Lombard rate is the highest short-term rate charged by the Bundesbank for supplementary borrowings by banks.    The West German discount rate, which was left unchanged at 3%, is a more widely used fee for bank borrowings from the central bank.    &quot;A discount-rate cut would have been more sincere,&quot; Charles A. Luma, vice president, foreign exchange, at Industrial Bank of Japan's New York office, said. &quot;Maybe that's what they'll come up with next.&quot;    Speculation about a cut in the West German discount rate was one of the few factors lending any restraint to yesterday's dollar sell-off. Lower West German interest rates would tend to make dollar-denominated investments more attractive.    Traders, however, focused on what they viewed as official permission from Washington to hammer the dollar down.    &quot;The White House has given us the green light to sell dollars. I don't know where it stops,&quot; Albert Soria, vice president, foreign exchange, at Swiss Bank Corp., New York, said.    Mr. Soria said yesterday's session &quot;reminded me of the post-Plaza period when the dollar was deliberately talked down.&quot; The Plaza accord, signed in September 1985 by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and Britain, set in motion a plan to push the dollar's value down through central bank selling. Officials also maintained pressure on the dollar by frequently voicing their desire to see it weaken.    The aim was to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit through a weaker dollar, which makes imports into the U.S. more expensive and exports more competitive abroad.    Traders said most major central banks were absent from the open market yesterday as trading sometimes became chaotic. The nations that signed the Plaza accord also have committed their central banks to intervene in currency markets to maintain orderly trading. Yesterday, however, only the Bank of Japan intervened in the open market, buying an estimated $1.5 billion in Tokyo, traders said. The Japanese central bank wouldn't confirm the report.    The Bundesbank, which intervened at the Frankfurt foreign-exchange fixing yesterday, buying $70.9 million, wasn't seen in the open market. &quot;There seems to be no willingness on either side of the Atlantic to stop the dollar's fall,&quot; Mr. Woodland of Harris Trust said.    Some market participants said the latest sell-off leaves the dollar in an oversold condition that may prompt a brief recovery. But any rebound is seen as limited. &quot;I still think the trend is down,&quot; said Mr. Luma of Industrial Bank of Japan.    Many dealers said the dollar probably will trend lower at least until significant reductions in the U.S. budget deficit are agreed to in the current negotiations between the administration and Congress.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $8.70 an ounce to $457.50 in heavy trading. Estimated volume was six million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $455.65 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.
