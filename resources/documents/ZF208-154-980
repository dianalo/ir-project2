&quot;How do I manage in it?&quot;andO;&quot;How can the company as a whole become more distributed, flexible, andresponsive?&quot; New questions at all levels of the organization.andM;Networking promises to overcome the age-old barrier to cooperative work, thesheer impact of physical distance on natural communication and collaboration.andO;But networking, the verb, the action, the &quot;doing something,&quot; does notautomatically come with networks, the noun.andP;  Just installing technology isnot enough.andP;  It's how people use it that counts.andM;All too often, people (net)working together fails to occur on the networks.andO;Companies fail to benefit from the potential of a computer-basedcommunications glue that ties the enterprise together.andP;  Yet the emergingstories of incredibly successful distributed work indicate that new ways ofworking are possible.andM;Networks and networking can bridge the gap between organizations andtechnology.andP;  By viewing organizations as networks, alongside our conventionalview of them as hierarchies and bureaucracies, we have a natural language formapping onto technology configurations.andP;  Or, more importantly, a way ofunderstanding human organization so that technology can be configured tosupport people.andM;A NETWORK DEFINITION.andP;  For a decade, The Networking Institute, Incorporated,has been studying people networks-from volunteer groups and social movementsto distributed businesses and high-tech teams.andP;  People networks, we havelearned, have the same structure as technology networks.andM;In 1985, as the networking boom was just beginning, Digital EquipmentCorporation published a marketing booklet called Networking: The CompetitiveEdge, which defined a network this way:andM;A network  comprises two or more intelligent devices (computer systems,intelligent terminals, and intelligent peripherals) linked in order toexchange information and share resources.&quot;andM;Leaving out the now dated parenthetical specifics, DECDigital's definitionshows three essential elements of a network: nodes, links, and purpose.andO;Networks are nodes linked together in order to do something, to achieve apurpose.andM;Nodes are the things, the centers of activity.andP;  Links are the relationships,the connections between nodes.andP;  Purpose, the &quot;in order to,&quot; is the criticalingredient in bringing nodes and links alive as a coherent unity.andM;TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS.andP;  In technology networks, wire, cable, microwave andother links, together with the supporting hardware, constitute thetraditionally narrow view of &quot;the network.&quot; But wires by themselves arenothing; the network as a whole includes the devices, the boxes-frommainframes to PCs-that are connected.andP;  Of critical importance also are theapplications that run on the network, the work processes that embody the &quot;inorder to&quot; that is the reason d'etre of the network.andM;While vendors might be selling wires, boxes, and software separately, theircustomers are trying to run the pieces as an integrated whole.andP;  When userssit down and log on, they depend upon the network to work as a whole.andM;ORGANIZATIONAL NETWORKS.andP;  In organizational networks, people and groups arethe nodes.andP;  Individually, people are linked in networks, both in small groupsand in large-scale associations.andP;  And organizational networks may spanmultiple levels, where small groups are linked together into a larger projector where businesses join associations of their peers.andM;Relationships are the links between people and groups.andP;  Organizationalnetworks are perceived in terms of patterns of interaction that support humanrelationships.andP;  While it is notoriously difficult to  see&quot; or quantifyrelationships, interaction can be observed.andP;  Interaction, in turn, dependsupon communication, which is very physical and very concrete.andM;Organizational purpose is expressed through goals.andP;  It is a clear and sharedpurpose is the motivational glue that holds an organizational networktogether.andP;  Without purpose, a people network will fail to cohere.andP;  Withoutrenewed and sustained goals, a human network win disintegrate.andM;Only people who think for themselves can internalize goals and act to benefita larger shared purpose without coercion or detailed policies.andP;  Thedecision-making and competence required of people working successfully in anetwork echoes the  intelligence&quot; required of networked technology devices.andO;In both people and technology networks, the nodes have an independence andautonomy of action separate from their cooperation as part of a successfulnetwork.andM;A COMMON LANGUAGE.andP;  Nodes, links, and purpose-these concepts provide a commonlanguage for understanding organizations and information technology.andP;  Nodesare people and devices.andP;  Links are relationships and wires.andP;  Purposes aregoals and applications.andM;For technology companies, network language provides a way to leveragetechnical knowledge to bridge the gap to organizational understanding.andP;  Fortheir customers and for themselves as companies of people, network languageprovides a new way to look at the organization, one that supplementstraditional hierarchical and bureaucratic views.andM;When we view an organization as comprising distributed work processes andnetworks of people, we can also see a natural configuration template fortechnology networks.andP;  As such, we can recognize the vital need forfundamental technology flexibility in adapting to changing people patterns.andM;The network is a powerful conceptual model, a tool for thinking abouttechnology and people issues.andP;  At the top level of the model are a handful ofessential elements-nodes, links, and purpose.andP;  This mental model captures thedistributed complexities of organizations of all sizes, just as a treediagram serves as a mental model for authority structures of afl sizes.andM;Networks can be as large as nations in international federations or as smallas a circle of friends.andP;  They are also a natural form for multinationalcorporations, industry associations, distributed work teams, and Old Boys.andM;GENERAL NETWORKS.andP;  Networks, like systems, have an abstract generalstructure.andP;  That is, the conceptual framework applies to more than one domainof knowledge-in this case, organizations and technology.andP;  General models arevaluable because they integrate knowledge from conceptually different worlds;they bridge gaps.andM;While the concept of &quot;system&quot; has flourished in the technology arena, in thesocial world it has a different connotation.andP;  There, it has developedprimarily in its  closed&quot; form, with a rigid structure.andP;  Organizationallyspeaking, &quot;The System&quot; implies a massive opaque structure that ensnarls andoppresses individuals.andP;  In a system, the parts tend to get lost in the whole.andO;It's the whole that's important.andM;A network is a naturally transparent and open system.andP;  Its parts-the nodes,the objects--are clearly differentiated and have an internal integrity.andO;Relationships are a fully visible and acknowledged part of tying the nodestogether into a whole.andP;  And through its multiple communications loops, anetwork has natural feedback characteristics and cybernetic, goal-seekingabilities.andM;When network is used to describe associations of people, it is the purposes,centers of activity, and communications patterns that predominate.andP;  This isnot to say that authority structures and policy patterns are not important.andO;Rather, the network viewpoint provides additional value and another way tograsp the complexities of human beings working together.andM;Flexible networks address core human resource issues.andP;  Networks provide a wayof designing and managing distributed work, finding and using people andskins where they are and when they are needed, load-balancing, and reducingrelocation stress.andP;  Successful networks tap into the primal source ofmotivation, individual values, and participation.andM;The network idea has been around for centuries.andP;  Now, it is finding newapplication as a strategy for seeing the future at work today.andP;  As ouronlydecades-old transition from the Industrial to the Infonmation Agecontinues to accelerate, networks will become increasingly important.andO;Jessica Lipnack, president, and Jeffery Stamps, Ph.D., director of research,are cofounders of networking Institute, Inc., a research and consultingcompany in West Newton, Massachusetts.andP;
