(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A prosecutor urged jurors today touse their common sense and deliver an obscenity conviction againstthree members of 2 Live Crew for a nightclub performance of theirbawdy rap music.   ``This was a plain, simple, nasty act,'' Assistant StateAttorney Pedro Dijols said in closing arguments. ``That's all itwas. It's unbelievable they can come in here with a straight faceand tell you something different.''   He urged jurors to review two tapes of the performance, eventhough prosecution witnesses had difficulty deciphering their ownrecordings.   After quoting some of the Miami group's profane lyrics, Dijolsasked, ``How can you say it's not offensive?''   Defense attorneys for the three defendants also were deliveringclosing arguments today, and the six-member jury was expected toreceive the case this afternoon.   Jurors must balance the defense testimony of a professor whosaid 2 Live Crew performs with artistic integrity and a sense ofhistory against a detective's report that the group promotedindecent behavior at the club.   Group leader Luther Campbell and members Chris ``Fresh Kid Ice''Wongwon and Mark ``Brother Marquis'' Ross were arrested onmisdemeanor obscenity charges after an adults-only concert June 10in nearby Hollywood. The three face up to a year in prison and$1,000 in fines if convicted.   Broward County sheriff's Detective Debbie Werder spent fourhours on the witness stand Friday attempting to translate ascratchy, often inaudible tape she made of the group's show.   Jurors burst into laughter when Werder described the type ofdancing she saw at the concert as ``humping.'' Three jurors laughedso hard that they cried, and the prosecution asked for a shortrecess. After the break, Werder testified: ``A lot of couples weredancing like they were having intercourse.''   The jury also heard Henry Louis Gates Jr., a professor ofEnglish literature at Duke University and literary critic of blackart and culture, describe 2 Live Crew's lyrics as an art formcalled ``signifying.''   Signifying is a form of rhythmic teasing and cajoling, oftenpeppered with lewd or off-color remarks that can be meant as insultor compliment, said Gates, whose book ``The Signifying Monkey'' wonlast year's American Book Award.   ``It was the way the black people could fight against theoppression of their slave masters,'' said Gates who is black. ``Andrapping is a contemporary form of signifying.''   ``There's no call to violence here. What you hear is greathumor, great joy and great boisterousness,'' he said. ``It's ajoke. It's a parody, and parody is one of the most venerated formsof art.''</TEXT></DOC>
