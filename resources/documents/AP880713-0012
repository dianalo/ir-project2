In a 3-0 decision, the court threw out a Shelby Circuit Courtpreliminary injunction that prevented Jennifer Ann Conn, 19, ofMorristown from ending her pregnancy.   Erin Andrew Conn, 23, of Elkhart, had argued that a father'srights should be weighed against the mother's wishes whendetermining if the woman can go ahead with an abortion. Mrs. Conn,who is approximately eight weeks pregnant, filed for a divorce onJune 17.   An attorney for the father immediately asked the state SupremeCourt to take an appeal of Tuesday's ruling and to issue a stay ofthe Court of Appeals action.   The state's highest court will likely consider those requests onWednesday, court administrator Karl Mulvaney said.   The appellate panel said acting Judge Robert T. Thopy of theShelby County court ignored case law from the U.S. Supreme Courtwhen he issued an injunction June 27 to prevent the abortion.   ``We hold that Erin has no right to veto Jennifer's decision toobtain an abortion as such decision concerns only her,'' JudgeRobert W. Neal wrote for the court.   The appellate court also ordered the Shelby County court todismiss all other proceedings concerning Mrs. Conn's plannedabortion. Thopy had planned to hold another hearing to determine ifMrs. Conn should be permanently barred from having an abortion.   The appellate opinion quoted extensively from two U.S. SupremeCourt decisions _ the 1973 Roe vs. Wade case in which statestatutes barring abortions in the first trimester were declaredunconstitutional and the 1976 Planned Parenthood of CentralMissouri vs. Danforth case.   In the Danforth decision, the high court struck down a law thatrequired a woman to have spousal approval before getting anabortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.   The appeals judges said Conn's arguments were philosophical andmoral in nature but weren't grounded in case law developed sincethe high court rulings.   Neal was joined in the opinion by Chief Judge Wesley W. RatliffJr. and Judge Jonathan J. Robertson.   James Bopp Jr., an attorney for Conn and a counsel for thenational Right to Life organization, said the decision is ``ripefor appeal.'' Bopp, who filed an appeal motion Tuesday afternoon,said the appellate judges had ignored a father's constitutionalrights.   ``I'm very disappointed the Indiana Court of Appeals failed torecognize a father's rights to have his interests weighed,'' Boppsaid.   Richard A. Waples, an Indiana Civil Liberties Union attorney whorepresented Mrs. Conn, said he was ``satisfied that the courtcorrectly applied the law and said that lower courts can't keepissuing orders stopping abortions.''</TEXT></DOC>
