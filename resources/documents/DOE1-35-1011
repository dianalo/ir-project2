A level schemewas constructed on the basis of gamma--gamma coincidence data, and themultipolarities of many transitions were established by conversion electronmeasurements. Levels in /sup 225/Fr were also studied with the /sup 226/Ra(t,{alpha})/sup225/Fr reaction at the McMaster University Accelerator Laboratory, usinga target of /sup 226/Ra(T/sub 1/2/ = 1600y) and a magnetic spectrographto analyze the alpha spectra. The first three excited states, at 28.5,82.5 and 128.2 keV, are interpreted as rotational band members basedon the ground state, which is known to have I = 3/2. The (t,{alpha})strengths to these levels indicate a 3/2{sup -}[532] assignment to theground state. No evidence for an octupole deformation in /sup 225/Frhas been found so far, although analysis of data for other excited statesis continuing.</TEXT></DOC>
