At least 15 workers were injured, police and unionofficials said.   Police also arrested an anti-apartheid activist and banned a CapeTown rally called for Sunday by outlawed rights organizations.   In another development, Trevor Tutu, son of Nobel Prize-winningArchbishop Desmond Tutu, was sentenced today to 18 months in prisonfor allegedly making a false bomb threat at Johannesburg'sinternational airport.   Mohammed Valli Moosa, an official of the banned United DemocraticFront and a leader of a new campaign to defy apartheid restrictions,was arrested at his Johannesburg office today and held there assecurity police searched his files.   Police ordered journalists from the building after the reporterssaw Valli Moosa in custody and were told he was under arrest.   There was no immediate indication what charges might be filedagainst Valli Moosa, one of three activists who escaped fromdetention last year and took sanctuary at the U.S. Consulate inJohannesburg.   Another escapee, Murphy Morobe, said Valli Moosa's arrestviolated the government's promise that the three were free to leavethe consulate without fear of being arrested again.   ``It shows how easy it is for the government to go back on itsword,'' said Morobe, who called on the U.S. government to condemnthe arrest.   The Food and Allied Workers Union said scores of workersassembled early today outside the Mama's Pies factory onJohannesburg's southeastern outskirts, a day after the companylocked them out because of a 4-week-old wage dispute.   The union said police used whips and live ammunition to dispersethe workers and made several arrests. The union said 15 workers wereinjured, some seriously.   Capt. Reg Crewe, a spokesman at police headquarters in Pretoria,said police acted only after workers began pulling on the lockedfactory gates and ingored an order to disperse. He said officersinitially used whips, but fired shotguns when some fleeing workersthrew stones.   He said four people were slightly injured by the shotgun fire and15 others suffered minor injuries while being dispersed. He said noone was arrested.   It was the second violent labor clash in two days.   On Thursday, police said at least 10 people were injured outsidethe British-owned Eveready plant in Port Elizabeth in clashesbetween striking workers and people recruited to fill their jobs.   Crewe, asked about the banned Cape Town rally, said he did notknow if similar rallies planned for Sunday in other cities alsowould be banned.   Desmond Tutu said the ban was ``inflammatory and dangerous'' andcalled for an alternative rally at his church in Cape Town.   Tutu's 32-year-old son, Trevor, was convicted of violating theAviation Act by falsely telling police that there was a bomb in hisluggage. He had pleaded innocent and said he would appeal theconviction.   Shortly after the Dec. 31 incident at Jan Smuts Airport, TrevorTutu convened a news conference and told reporters he deliberatelycourted arrest as part of a publicity stunt on behalf of hisadvertising agency.   He also was convicted on three counts of criminal injury andfined $440 for allegedly interfering with police last year when theytried to arrest a friend of his on suspicion of drunken driving.   In 1984, Trevor Tutu was held by police for three days before hewas cleared of a charge of drunken driving. In 1985, he was brieflydetained after arguing with police at a courthouse about thedetention of black children.   Tutu's father is leader of the Anglican Church in southern Africaand one of the country's most prominent anti-apartheid activists.There was no immediate comment from the archbishop about his son'sconviction.   The United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition of activistorganizations, and 16 other anti-apartheid groups last year wereordered to halt all activities. They intended to declare themselveslegal on Sunday, the front's sixth anniversary.   The rallies were organized as part of a nationwide campaign ofdefiance. In other phases of the campaign, blacks have soughttreatment at segregated white hospitals and dozens of activists havedefied restrictions imposed on them following their recent releasefrom imprisonment.</TEXT></DOC>
