Iraq now has 360,000 troops and 2,800 tanks in occupiedKuwait and nearby areas of Iraq, said Pentagon spokesman PeteWilliams. Those estimates are up from the Pentagon'sestimates of 265,000 troops and 2,200 tanks two weeks ago.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Williams said that while there are more Iraqi tanks inthe area, some of them have been pulled back to positionsfarther away from Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia, wheresome 130,000 American soldiers are massed along with forcesfrom several other nations. Still, the higher overall troopand tank estimate is significant, because it shows a steadygrowth in the size of the force Iraq could immediately use ifhostilities erupt.   At the same time, the Bush administration sent a series ofmixed signals to Jordan, a neighbor of Iraq that hasmaintained good ties with Baghdad since Iraq's Aug. 2invasion of Kuwait. The State Department reproached Jordanfor playing host to a conference last weekend of Arabradicals that openly called for attacks on American targetsand the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.   &quot;We were surprised and dismayed that this conference tookplace, and we have told the Jordanians so,&quot; said MargaretTutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman. &quot;We want to workwith Jordan during and after this crisis in the Gulf. Hostingthe conference is very hard for us to understand.&quot;   At the same time, the State Department reported thatJordan still appears to be receiving about 40% of its oilfrom Iraq, a technical violation of the international tradeembargo. But the department seemed sympathetic towardJordan's need for Iraqi oil. Ms. Tutwiler emphasized thatJordan had reduced its dependence on Iraqi oil from 90%before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and she said she hopedJordan could cut its use of Iraqi oil further as it gets neweconomic aid from other countries.   Separately, the Pentagon disclosed that American sailorsstopped and boarded a Soviet cargo ship as it carried goodsto the Jordanian port of Aqaba. American forces determinedthat the cargo wasn't bound for Iraq and let the ship travelon to Jordan, the Pentagon said.   The U.S. also announced that it is sending three militaryaircraft to fly relief missions to help refugees from Iraqand Kuwait who have fled to Jordan. The planes will carry inblankets, cots and other supplies for the refugees and carrysome of the refugees to their homelands.   The increase in Iraqi troop strength in and around Kuwaitappears to be at least partly a result of a slightrestructuring of forces by Iraq as it consolidates itspositions in the area. Mr. Williams, the Pentagon spokesman,said that the increase was caused partly by the addition oftroops to &quot;round out&quot; Iraqi units sent in earlier and partlybecause infantry units, which use more troops, are beingmoved forward as armored units are moved back from the Saudiborder.   &quot;There has been a gradual buildup in Iraqi forces sincethis operation began,&quot; Mr. Williams said. &quot;There has been nosudden surge. It's certainly a continued buildup.&quot;   Separately, Central Intelligence Agency Director WilliamWebster warned in a New York speech that Iraqi presidentSaddam Hussein has &quot;recently revived&quot; his ties &quot;to thosePalestinian terrorists who have gone after Westerninterests.&quot;   Mr. Webster said &quot;what intelligence has tracked andreported in the past year about Iraq's involvement interrorism concerns us.&quot; He said American intelligence hasdetermined that Saddam Hussein now &quot;has both strong ties toPalestinian terrorists and an elaborate network within hisown intelligence service capable of carrying out terroristattacks.&quot;   The CIA chief specifically cited Saddam Hussein's ties toterrorist groups led by Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas. Iraq'srenewed ties to terrorists had been reported, but Mr.Webster's is the strongest on-the-record confirmation thatU.S. intelligence is concerned about it.   Mr. Webster also disclosed that the CIA has set up specialtask forces to work on the Persian Gulf crisis, and ismonitoring Iraqi troops, ships, terrorists and &quot;the conditionand status of the foreign hostages being held in Iraq andKuwait.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
