(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pupils returning this fall to SandpiperShores Elementary School near this quiet, well-to-do Palm BeachCounty community will find much of their schoolyard off limits.   Not because of construction, or asbestos, or hazardous waste, butbecause of the power lines next to the school that can carry 230,000volts.   Emanating from the lines are electromagnetic fields _ presentwherever there is electric power _ that have been linked toeverything from cancer to miscarriages, chronic depression andlearning disorders.   Galvanized by reports of possible health risks, parents took theschool board to court last November. When classes started inJanuary, before a ruling came down, some parents kept children homeor sent them to private schools.   ``I saw it as a gamble with my children's life,'' said SteveTenner, a stockbroker who sent his 9-year-old daughter, Kerry, toprivate school this year and plans to do the same for his 4-year-oldson Jeff. ``The dosage they're receiving now may not affect them foranother 20 years.''   In their lawsuit, Tenner and Robert and Sharon Rausch contendedthat the electromagnetic fields from a series of power lines thatbegins 135 feet from the nearest school building may be harmful totheir children's health.   Palm Beach Circuit Judge Timothy Poulton ruled this summer thatthere was insufficient evidence of potential harm to close theschool as the parents had asked, but he did close much of theschoolyard during recess and barred outdoor activities in an areathat includes art and music rooms and the cafeteria.   ``The evidence is clear that both electrical and magnetic fieldsaffect the human body,'' he said. ``Depending on the dosage, theresult can be harmful to the human body, increasing the incidence ofcancer and other disease.''   Although research has not proven that electromagnetic fields arehazardous, it does show that power at 60 hertz (cycles per second),a frequency commonly used in North America, can produce biologicalchanges in humans.   A recent Carnegie Mellon University report for the federal Officeof Technology Assessment noted ``legitimate reasons for concern''over EMFs, and even more disturbing, fields from sources likehousehold wiring and appliances.   ``The results are very complicated,'' said M. Granger Morgan, whoheads Carnegie Mellon's Engineering and Public Policy Department andhelped prepare the report. ``I think everybody agrees looking at thescience that it's most unlikely the fields will be an initiator ofcancer. The way the fields appear to interact with cells is the veryelaborate processes on the surface of the cell. That's why thenotion of cancer promoter has gotten going.''   The report also noted that construction of power lines isincreasingly beset by public intervention and lawsuits. The issue isexpected to heat up in states including Florida, New York,California, Texas, Washington and Oregon. Already suits have forcedutilities to delay, reroute and even scrap planned construction. OneCanadian utility has offered to buy homes along a power-linecorridor.   In Florida, among several states with electric field standardsand the first to set a standard for magnetic fields, strongopposition is building from homeowners, parents andenvironmentalists to proposed 500,000-volt lines in the west-centraland southeastern parts of the state. Should scientists prove thatfields are dangerous, the implications would be staggering.   It would be ``a multibillion-dollar problem to correct,'' saidBuck Oven of the state Department of Environmental Regulation. ``Itmay be we will have to come up with an alternative method of gettingpower to people.''   Even if additional research turns up nothing, ``public perceptionis a powerful driving force,'' said Ron Spinka, a spokesman for theFlorida Electric Power Coordinating Group, whose members producenearly all the state's power.   The Boca Raton school case is being closely watched. AttorneyLarry Marraffino, who represented the parents, hailed it as one ofthe first ``to have judicial recognition that these fields can causeharm.''   School board lawyer Abbey Hairston said, ``I have to take theposition the judge was saying there's not anything there yet''because he didn't completely close the school. ``Even if there's anassociation, the risk at Sandpiper Shores is no greater than that atthe home environment.''   Marraffino disputes the contention that children aren'tthreatened. ``I think we're just at the stage now maybe asbestos wasmany years ago. They're still trying to understand the mechanism bywhich it works. There's no doubt in my mind in 10 years, it's goingto be a foregone conclusion.''   Poulton reserved the right to alter his ruling, if necessary,based on additional scientific data. In post-trial motions, he alsoordered the school board to pay for periodic radiation measurements,but he refused to let parents transfer children to nearby schoolsafter the board argued that parents would seek transfers for a hostof environmental concerns.   Sharon Rausch recalls taking her concerns to the board. ``Theywere real hung up on conclusive proof. That means names on deathcertificates, and I didn't feel that was the right approach.''   The Rausches believe EMFs may have contributed to the death frombrain-stem cancer in 1985 of their 8-year-old son William. Theschool where they had lived before, in Warner Robins, Ga., had powerlines out front.   If not for the lines, Mrs. Rausch would have preferred sendingher two youngest children to Sandpiper Shores, a sprawling campus ofone-story tan brick buildings and portable classrooms attended bymore than 1,000 children.   Unable to transfer 10-year-old Angela and 7-year-old Jared toanother school or to afford private school, the Rausches turnedtheir living room into a classroom and now teach their youngest ofthree children at home.   For years, scientists were convinced there was no risk because 60hertz power produces extremely low frequency fields that don't causetissue damage as do other forms of electromagnetic radiation likeX-rays and microwaves. But the view of ``categorically no harm'' ison hold as evidence of effects builds.   ``By and large the scientists don't have their minds made up.They are genuinely puzzled,'' said Carnegie Mellon's Morgan. ``Thereare enough suggestive studies that we ought to continue exploringthis.''   One of the most puzzling aspects is how much exposure for howlong may pose a health threat. In fact, higher voltages may notnecessarily be worse than lower ones; tissue may only be affected atcertain levels.   Epidemiological studies have found a higher incidence of cancerin exposed groups. In the so-called ``henhouse project,'' fertilizedchicken eggs exposed to pulses at 60 hertz produced a greaterproportion of abnormal embryos.   Other studies have found increased enzyme activity in tumorcells, changes in the functioning of the genetic material DNA andRNA, changes in the calcium flow across cell membranes, changes inthe neurotransmitters which send signals between nerves and changesin the hormones that control the biological clock.   Still other studies have found no link between fields and healtheffects.   The OTA report noted that the epidemiological studies have shown``a weak association'' between field exposure and leukemia andnervous system cancer.   Researchers also say that despite a dramatic increase in powerconsumption over several decades there's been no accompanying risein cancer rates. And if there was a problem, they say, the publicwould also have to be concerned about household appliances likecoffeemakers, blenders, vacuums, electric blankets, hair dryers andshavers. Any risk would be quite small compared with other causes ofdeath, such as smoking, according to researchers.   The link between EMFs and cancer was first raised in the late1970s in a Colorado study by Nancy Wertheimer and Ed Leeper ofchildren living near power distribution lines. More than a decadelater, public awareness will mean more battles for power companiesand added pressure for intensive studies.   All sides agree that a major research effort is the key tosettling the debate over electromagnetic radiation. Millions arebeing spent on studies, by the Electric Power Research Institute,the research arm of the power industry, and the U.S. EnergyDepartment, among others. The National Cancer Institute also willinclude EMFs in a three-year study of childhood leukemia.   Meanwhile, parents in Boca Raton and another group in BrowardCounty near Davie, where Florida Power andamp; Light is facing stiffopposition to a transmission line proposal, say they'd rather playit safe than accept any assurances.   ``I feel it's too unknown,'' said Dorothy Doering, whose5-year-old son is is going to a private school instead of the Davieelementary school being built near high-voltage power lines. ``I'mreally that fearful. You get five experts who say it's safe and fivethat say it's not.   ``I just don't want to take the chance.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sept. 4</NOTE></DOC>
