The storm lashed La Rivera, Buenavista and other small towns onthe coast of the sparsely populated Baja California Sur state.   ``The wind is very strong. There's a lot of water. There aretrees down. But there have been no casualties,'' Antonio AlvarezAcevedo, public security director in San Jose del Cabo, said of LaRivera. About 4,000 people live in the town and surrounding area, hesaid.   La Rivera is about 75 miles south of La Paz, the state capital.   ``The eye is brushing along the southeastern edge'' of thepeninsula, approximately between the town of Buenavista and LosBarriles, Bob Case of the National Hurricane Center in in CoralGables, Fla., said by telephone.   Buenavista is about 60 miles southeast of La Paz and Los Barrileslies between the two cities.   At 11 p.m. local time, (2 a.m. EDT Sunday) the storm was locatednear latitude 23.9 north and longitude 109.7 west, or about 40 mileseast-southeast of La Paz. It was moving northwest at about 5 mph,said the National Weather Service in Miami.   The weather bulletin said Kiko made landfall but did not saywhen. The storm expected to lose strength as it crossed thepeninsula in the next 24 hours, it said.   Electricity was off in La Rivera, Buenavista and in San Jose delCabo, near the tip of the peninsula, Alvarez Acevedo said.   Alvarez Acevedo said the few hotels along the coast around LaRivera had not been evacuated.   ``They are the type of construction that can take it,'' he said.   Waves more than 10 feet high were crashing on the coast inBuenavista, a town of 800 people, said Hector Castro Marron, thesecurity and transit agent on duty.   Many people who were staying in the town's three hotels took theSaturday morning plane to Los Angeles, he said.   Heavy rain fell afternoon, rushing down normally dry gullies, hesaid. He said about four families who live along a gully inBuenavista had been told they should leave their homes.   A strong wind was blowing about 7 p.m. (9 p.m. EDT), and someresidents had taped or boarded up windows, he said.   According to the U.S. National Weather Service in Miami, Kiko wasa ``small'' hurricane with sustained winds up to 115 mph Saturdaynight.   La Paz, with 160,000 inhabitants, has half the population of thestate, which occupies the southern half of the Baja CaliforniaPeninsula. It is about 760 miles south of San Diego.   Zatarain said emergency supplies were being mustered and sheltersstocked with food and blankets throughout the state. Storm warningswere being broadcast, civil defense units had been mobilized andmilitary units were standing by, he said.   Ferry service between the peninsula and the mainland wascanceled, he said.   On the mainland, the Sinaloa state government had an emergencyplan in effect, the government news agency Notimex said.   The airline Aeromexico canceled or diverted service to LosMochis, Mazatlan and La Paz on Saturday after making an earlymorning flight to the three cities, the reservations office said.
