A West German court in Frankfurt convicted Hamadi in thehijacking and the brutal beating and murder of Navy diver RobertStethem, 23, of Waldorf, Md., then sentenced the 24-year-oldterrorist to life in prison.   Flight 847 was seized on June 14, 1985, after the Boeing 727took off from Athens for Rome. The plane flew twice to Algiers andthree times to Beirut on the hijackers' orders. Thirty-nineAmericans were held hostage for 17 days.   Hamadi received the maximum sentence under West German law, butNavy Lt. j.g. Stuart Dahl, 35, of Port Hueneme, Calif., who wastraveling with Stethem when the plane was hijacked, said theterrorist deserved a sterner fate.   Dahl told Fargo, N.D., radio station WDAY that Hamadi shouldhave been extradited to the United States to stand trial and shouldhave been sentenced to death.   ``He deserved to be treated like a terrorist and die aterrorist's death _ violently,'' the Thief River Falls, Minn.,native, said.   Three San Franciscans who were passengers on Flight 847 saidthey feared that West Germany would be pressured to release him.   ``We have very strong reason to believe that the West Germanshave made a deal for an early release _ or at least have ledHamadi's family and supporters in Beirut to think so,'' MauriSchwartz told a news conference in San Francisco attended by fellowpassengers Dino Cucchi and his wife, Loretta.   Reading a statement by the three, Ms. Schwartz said recentkidnappings and releases of West Germans in Lebanon appeared to beconnected to Hamadi's case.   ``We are satisfied that this verdict and sentence areappropriate punishment for his crimes and for that we breathe asigh of relief,'' she said.   ``We ask the West German government to abide by the court'sdecision and keep Hamadi in prison for the rest of his life. We askthe U.S. government to insist on this in every aspect of ourforeign policy.   ``If he does get to go back, he will do it again,'' Ms. Schwartzsaid, speaking for herself.   A West German prosecutor, Peter Korneck, said Hamadi will beeligible for parole review in 15 years. Defense attorneys said theyexpected to appeal the sentence.   Like Stethem, Carlson was singled out by the terrorists forespecially brutal treatment. The Rockford, Ill., businessman wasreturning from Army Reserve duty in the Middle East and wascarrying a government passport.   ``I'm really glad they're going to put that guy away,'' he saidin a telephone interview Wednesday from a college alumni outing atMyrtle Beach, S.C.   ``He really didn't seem to care if all of us died or not,'' saidCarlson, 42. ``He deserved the worst punishment there is for whathe did, not just to me but to Robert Stethem and all the passengersand the crew.''   The Rev. James McLoughlin of Geneva, Ill., one of three priestsleading Illinois Roman Catholics who were returning from apilgrimage to the Holy Land aboard Flight 847, said he was glad thedeath penalty was not an option.   ``That would just continue the anger, the chain reaction ofretribution,'' McLoughlin said.   ``This is kind of a period to the whole thing,'' said EvelynBalt, 74, of Oswego, Ill. ``Maybe now they'll let it die. You thinkyou've put it completely out of your mind, and then something likethis comes up and brings it all back again.''</TEXT></DOC>
