Instead, it is considering more-sedate ways to team up with rivals.    These include marketing and operational alliances, shared flight codes, joint purchase arrangements and even minority equity swaps.    &quot;A frantic spate of carrier consolidations within the short span of a couple of years isn't likely to happen in Europe,&quot; Alitalia Chairman Umberto Nordio said at a recent conference in London sponsored by Airline Business magazine. Because of legal restrictions to cross-border takeovers and mergers, he said, &quot;European airlines, in their mandatory quest for scale economies and market strength through size, won't be able to follow the direct path of consolidation . . . .&quot;    Yet major European carriers still want to grow in order to better compete with huge U.S. airlines flexing their marketing muscles in Europe and elsewhere. And smaller European airlines still want to perfect niche strategies or join with larger carriers in complementary alliances.    But now airline chieftains don't play down the difficulties of cross-border ties. They watched perennial suitor Scandinavian Airlines System run into a brick wall of national pride last year when it tried to merge with Belgium's Sabena, and then into legal and political problems while seeking a stake in British Caledonian Airways.    Another reason airlines no longer are talking mergers is fear of the unknown: the European Community's four-month-old airline-liberalization package is much less sweeping and pro-competition than expected.    Finally, the closely watched U.S. airline industry has ended a consolidation surge in which at least eight major takeovers were announced in two years. U.S. carriers have found that the results include acrimonious labor relations, perilous finances and operational mayhem. Europeans, who last year feared this would happen to them, are beginning to relax, or even betray smug satisfaction, because their industry has been more restrained.    But there still is much talk about teaming up. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is in discussions with Koninklijke Nedlloyd Groep N.V., the Dutch shipping company that owns Netherlines, a regional air carrier, and Transavia, a charter carrier. Swissair said it considered, but decided against, taking an equity stake in USAir. Dogged SAS now is in talks with the Argentine flag carrier, Aerolineas Argentinas, for a 40% share and is said to be in talks of some sort with Texas Air Corp. British Airways is thought to be interested in buying 25% of Air New Zealand, while Sabena, KLM, Swissair, Alitalia and the French airline Union de Transports Aeriens all say they are talking with European carriers and others about linkups.    There are even some tangible alliances, notably two new European airline computer-reservation systems, Amadeus and Galileo.    But outright mergers appear out of favor. Even Alitalia's Mr. Nordio, who only a year ago said he was &quot;willing to hold merger talks tomorrow,&quot; now sees a more conservative evolution. He predicts European carriers will seek linkages through marketing and operating alliances and so-called code-sharing agreements.    Sharing a flight code, the number that is assigned to each flight, sounds like a small thing, but it's extremely important. The way most computer-reservation systems are set up, if one airline's flight connects to another airline's flight with the same code number, it will show up on a travel agent's computer before another connecting flight with a different number, says Wesley Kaldahl, senior vice president, international, for American Airlines. Airlines that share flight codes thus stand a better chance of getting passengers to book their connecting flights.    Joint fleet planning may come next, says Mr. Nordio, perhaps leading to exchanges of equity and joint financial management. Then, he adds, the partners &quot;may contemplate the possibility of giving birth to a new animal, the multinational megacarrier. . . .&quot;    Richard Bond, airline specialist for the London consulting firm Cresap, McCormick andamp; Paget, says this dating game is motivated by &quot;the search for long-term growth.&quot; Carriers can grow internally by lowering fares and stimulating traffic, by improving labor productivity, and by arranging their route networks to divert traffic from other carriers, Mr. Bond says. But all these tactics depend on full-blown deregulation, which isn't forthcoming in Europe. So cooperating with others is seen as increasingly attractive.    What is in it for consumers? Probably not cheaper tickets, but it could lead to the paradox of fewer airlines and better service. In such international joint ventures, schedules, connections and overall service are expected to be so superior that consumers are expected to choose the joint service over the conventional alternatives, says Jeffrey Shane, a U.S. State Department aviation negotiator.    One of the first to act, in a takeover and a marketing alliance, was British Airways. After outbidding SAS, BA's #250 million ($473 million) takeover of British Caledonian was completed this year.    In December, BA signed a marketing arrangement with United Airlines, a unit of Allegis Corp. of the U.S., that features code-sharing, joint price promotions, common round-the-world and fly-drive packages and shared airport terminals. </TEXT></DOC>
