Border Patrol sector chief Silvestre Reyes said 70 additionalborder patrol agents were brought in, bringing the border patrolforce to about 130, and 15 to 20 uniformed immigration officers alsowere called to the scene Thursday.   ``We're concerned about the possibility that this may reoccur,''Reyes said.   INS officials said 1,621 detainees were in the outdoor recreationarea Thursday afternoon when about 200 Central American immigrantsdemanded their freedom.   ``They were throwing rocks, shaking the fence and some of themripped part of the fence up,'' said Omer Sewell, Immigration andNaturalization Service dicstric director.   Riot police formed a line 20 feet outside the row of doublefencing as the detainees chanted in Spanish, ``We want freedom,''and, ``The people united will never be defeated.''   ``There was no attempt at any hostages, no injuries, no leaders,no demands,'' said Mario Ortiz, INS regional public affairs directorin Dallas. ``They just became agitated. We were able to push themback and to get them back from the fence.''   Reyes said ``nine potential ringleaders'' were being questioned.   Civilian workers were sent out of the Port Isabel ServiceProcessing Center, located about 20 miles northeast of the bordercity of Brownsville.   ``I think they're trying to get the INS' attention, and I knowthis is about the third time they've been trying to do this becausethey have more than 2,000 people in there,'' said Brownsvilleimmigration attorney Linda Yanez.   The detainee population Thursday was 2,248, including somestaying in tents because dormitories have filled to capacity.   U.S. Rep. Solomon Ortiz, whose district includes the center, saidthe unrest will continue as more people are detained.   ``As they increase and the more that they stay in detention, themore problems they will have,'' Ortiz said.   U.S. Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., chairman of the HouseSubcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and International Law, saidthe demonstration was probably a minor incident, but could becomemore volatile.   ``People should be skeptical that merely detaining these peopleis solving the problem,'' Morrison said.   Detainees, awaiting immigration-court hearings, have complainedof high deportation bonds set by immigration officials, as well aslack of food, showers and medical attention.   Sewell said none of the complaints are justified.   The detention center's population has increased more thanfive-fold since Feb. 21, when the government began immediatedetention of political-asylum applicants whose cases are denied.   The INS since that date also has stepped up enforcement on theborder and stopped releasing on their own recognizance undocumentedaliens who are apprehended at the southern tip of the state.   More than 40,000 Central Americans have applied for politicalasylum since last spring in southern Texas, the closest crossingpoint from Central America.</TEXT></DOC>
