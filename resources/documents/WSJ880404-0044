In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Industrial Equity said it holds 2,062,941 Steego common shares, including 809,000 shares purchased from Jan. 6 to March 30 for $3.31 to $4.487 share. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Steego closed Thursday at $4.58 a share, up 12.5 cents. The exchange was closed Friday in observance of Good Friday.    Industrial Equity didn't give a reason in the filing for boosting its holding.    J. Russell Duncan, Steego's chairman and chief executive officer, said he &quot;welcomes&quot; the investment because it indicates &quot;confidence that our management is moving the company in the right direction.&quot; Besides, Mr. Duncan and his family own 20% of Steego's stock and the company has &quot;all kinds of shark repellents, so we don't worry about a takeover very much,&quot; he said.    Steego is based in West Palm Beach, Fla., and is in the auto parts business, among other things. </TEXT></DOC>
