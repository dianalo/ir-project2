Israel said it destroyed the base.   The air strike came just hours after Israeli paratroopers backedby tanks and air cover swept deep into southern Lebanon, killingguerrillas and wiping out another Lebanese Communist base.   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military command said the Communistcommand post at Rmeile, 20 miles south of Beirut, was destroyed inthe air raid.   ``At the terrorist target ... there are dead and wounded,'' thearmy said, adding that the Israeli fighter jets returned safely totheir bases. No further details were released.   Lebanese police said at least three people were killed and sevenwounded in the five-minute air raid. Israeli authorities said therewere no Israeli casualties in either attack.   Six Phantom F-4 fighter bombers attacked Rmeile, and guerrillasfired several heat-seeking SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles that weredeflected by balloons released by the Israeli pilots, policereported.   Earlier today, paratroopers attacked a Communist base which thearmy described as a terrorist target used as a launching pad foranti-Israeli attacks.   That attack was the Israeli army's biggest ground operation inLebanon in more than a year. The later air raid was Israel's 17thsuch strike in Lebanon this year. At least 18 people were killedand 109 wounded in the previous 16 air raids.   In Beirut, police said army sappers defused a car packed with165 pounds of explosives near Prime Minister Salim Hoss' office.Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, was at home five blocks away when the bombwas discovered, and police said it appeared he was not the target.   A police spokesman said it was defused a half-hour before it wasset to go off. ``A bloodbath has been averted,'' said thespokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations.   The guerrilla base at Nabi Safa, in the foothills of MountHermon 7{ miles north of Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone''in Lebanon, was manned by the Moscow-oriented Lebanese CommunistParty.   The Israeli army's attack was its biggest ground operation inLebanon since an assault against the Syrian-backed Popular Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine-General Command Dec. 9, 1988.   The attack force of about 100 commandos pushed out from theborder enclave, occupied by the Israelis since 1985, in four tanksand eight armored personnel carriers at 2 a.m. behind a massiveartillery barrage, police reported.   The attackers stormed through the villages of Kfar Meshki andLebbaya in the eastern Bekaa Valley after two helicopter gunshipsblasted them with eight rockets, destroying many houses, thespokesman said. He cannot be named under standing regulations.   Forty other commandos were then dropped by helicopters in NabiSafa, where they blew up the Communists' two-story command postafter raking the base with machine-gun fire, the spokesman added.   He said the attackers pulled back into the security zone twohours after the attack began.   Israel carved out the two- to 15-mile wide border enclave tocurb guerrilla raids following its army's withdrawal from Lebanonthree years after it invaded in 1982.   The 2,500-man South Lebanese Army holds the enclave along withan estimated 1,500 Israeli troops.   The Israeli assault came amid heavy fighting in south Lebanonbetween two rival Shiite Moslem factions, the Iranian-backedHezbollah, or Party of God, and the Syrian-allied Amal.   Police have reported at least 38 people killed and 150 woundedin four days of battles in a power struggle for control ofLebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.</TEXT></DOC>
