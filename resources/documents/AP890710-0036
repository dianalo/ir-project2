The People's Daily, official mouthpiece of the 47.7million-member party, said 452 officials in the southern province ofGuizhou were expelled for corruption during the first half of 1989.   On Sunday, it was reported that one local party leader in Guizhouwas given the death sentence for selling counterfeit liquor.   The official press recently has highlighted crackdowns oncorruption as part of the drive to improve its image following itsviolent June 4 crackdown on the student-led movement for democraticreform.   The students won wide support among the general populace duringtheir seven-week campaign of class boycotts, marches and sit-ins bydemanding action to end rampant corruption among Chinese officials.   Protesters frequently referred to how leaders use their influenceto obtain good jobs and trips abroad for their children. Among thosecriticized was senior leader Deng Xiaoping, whose son Deng Pufangformerly had connections with a company singled out for involvementin speculation and profiteering.   The People's Daily said today that instances of party membersinvolved in bribe-taking and graft in Guizhou were up 25 percentfrom the first half of 1988, and that top priority should be givento investigating the behavior of party members.   It also reported that Wang Yuntian, vice chairman of thecommodity prices committee in the western province of Gansu, wasexpelled from the party for making $170,000 by profiteering in sugar.   The front-page article said another Gansu official was trickedout of $81,000 during an unauthorized trip to Hong Kong. Oneofficial used public funds to buy a private home and another soldstate-supplied medicine and used the money to hold an elaboratefuneral for his wife.   Another man, chairman of a commerce and industry bureau in asouthern China city, was drummed out of the party for trying toimpede an investigation into a local cigarette trafficking case, thedaily reported.   The paper, in a lengthy front-page commentary, acknowledged thatthe recent pro-democracy unrest garnered wide public support``because some party members, cadres and especially a minority ofleaders were engaged in corrupt practices which made the people verydissatisfied.   ``Of course the organizers of the rebellion used anti-corruptionslogans to incite the uncertain public. The party will continue itsfight against corruption,'' it said.   The commentary promised that those found guilty ``will bepunished irrespective of who they are, for if we don't fightcorruption, then our party will be separated from the people andthis may lead to chaos.''   The ``rebellion'' refers to the pro-democracy movement that wascrushed June 4 when soldiers ran student protesters out of centralBeijing, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians. Hundreds more havesince been arrested.   The movement also triggered a power struggle within the party,ending with the purging of party chief Zhao Ziyang for showingsympathy to some of the student demands.   The People's Daily commentary stressed that students who tookpart in demonstrations will be given greater ideological educationbut will not be punished, while those who led the``counterrevolutionary rebellion will not be forgiven.''   It urged all Chinese to make extra efforts to carry out fourmajor tasks set forth by at a meeting last month of the party'sgoverning Central Committee, with top priority given to the``quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion.''   The other tasks are promoting the economic open-door policy,enhancing ideological work and strengthening the party.   It said young people who lack understanding of the West ``easilyaccept capitalist propaganda'' and should be educated to resist``bourgeois liberalization,'' the attraction to Western culture.   ``This is very important to the future of our country.''</TEXT></DOC>
