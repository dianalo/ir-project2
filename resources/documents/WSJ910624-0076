Separately, an Intel spokesman confirmed reports thatFederal Trade Commission officials approached at least oneIntel customer last month with questions about Intel'sbusiness practices. Intel dominates the market formicroprocessors that are the &quot;brains&quot; of personal computers,and the company has come under some fire for the way itdivvies up chips that are in short supply.</LP><TEXT>   Intel, a Santa Clara, Calif., company, said the newversion of its 486 chip will run at 50 megahertz, or 51%faster than the current highest-speed version of the chip.Several big PC makers this week plan to unveil machines basedon the chip.   Intel's 486 chips are rapidly gaining favor as the&quot;brains&quot; of high-speed personal computers. A low-cost versionof the chip, the 486SX, helped push down PC pricesdrastically after its introduction earlier this year. Withthe new chip, Intel aims to move into high-end markets thatare the turf of workstation makers, such as Sun MicrosystemsInc. and Digital Equipment Corp., said Intel senior vicepresident David House.   Intel expects the new chip to be used, for example, inhigh-speed computers called &quot;servers,&quot; which businesses oftenuse to tie multiple desktop computers into networks and intodata bases. The chip will also go into extremely fast desktopmachines used for such tasks as financial analysis that usehuge amounts of computing power, Mr. House said.   Intel said it has shipped samples of the chip, which willlist for $655 each. Intel will begin shipping large volumesof the chip within 90 days from its factory in Albuquerque,N.M., said Mr. House, who added that Intel expects to sellmore than two million 486 chips this year. Intel also said itwill lower prices across its PC-microprocessor line nextMonday. The price of a 33 megahertz 486, for example, willfall to $445 from the current $667, while the price of thepopular 386DX chip will fall 4% to $161.   Meanwhile, Intel said it was informed in May by a computermaker that FTC officials had approached the maker to askquestions about a broad range of industry issues, includingIntel's business practices. The New York Times reportedSaturday that executives at two PC makers said they werecontacted by FTC lawyers, who inquired about how Intel sellsits chips.   The Intel spokesman said the FTC hasn't approached Inteland that Intel isn't aware of any formal inquiry, adding thatthe queries appeared to be routine and &quot;not serious.&quot; Intelassumes, he said, that the FTC queries were related tocomplaints about the way Intel allocates certain chips thatonly Intel makes, some of which have been in short supply.   Such complaints have centered on Intel's 386 chips, thecompany's best-selling, which were in chronic short supplyfrom early last year until this month. Intel tended toallocated the chips to past customers, often leaving newer,smaller PC makers without enough chips to meet orders. Somemakers charged that Intel -- the only maker of 386 chipsuntil Advanced Micro Devices Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif.,introduced a clone this year -- was abusing its monopoly ofthe market for those chips to maintain fat profit margins.   Supplies of the 386 chip now meet demand, said Intel's Mr.House. But Intel's new 486SX chip is now in short supply, hesaid.   Other possible sources of FTC interest are severalantitrust lawsuits against Intel.   Cyrix Corp., a Richardson, Texas, maker of chips thatmimic some of Intel's, sued Intel last year, charging thatIntel had tried to hinder Cyrix's business by intimidatingits customers. Separately, several former distributors ofIntel's chips this year filed antitrust suits against Intelafter the company cut off chip supplies.   Intel officials argue that Intel's allocation policiesabide by antitrust laws and that Intel is entitled to a legalmonopoly through patents for its PC chips, adding that Intelhas never been the subject of a formal FTC inquiry. Intellawyers say the suits filed by Cyrix and by the distributorsare without merit.   In Washington, an FTC official refused to comment on thematter.</TEXT></DOC>
