The Toronto-based aerospace and communications concern posted a loss of 4.4 million dollars ($3.6 million) last year. Excluding an extraordinary charge, it earned 5.4 million dollars, or 50 cents a share.    Spar yesterday reported first-quarter net income of 2.7 million dollars, or 25 cents a share, on revenue of 55.9 million dollars, compared with a year-earlier loss of 527,000 dollars on revenue of 44.5 million dollars.    Mr. Clarke said the market for the company's space-related equipment was recovering after being depressed three years because of failed space launches. He said the Canadian government's decision last month to participate in the U.S. government's space-station program is expected to lead to about 750 million dollars of new contracts for Spar through about 1996. </TEXT></DOC>
