Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze emerged shortly after 5 p.m., local time, yesterday from a second day of talks here and shook hands in front of reporters and cameramen. Mr. Shultz said the two had reached &quot;complete agreement on all of the outstanding INF issues.&quot; He was referring to intermediate-range nuclear forces -- 572 U.S missiles and 644 missiles deployed by the Russians.    &quot;All that remains is treaty language, which others will be able to do,&quot; Mr. Shultz said. &quot;We're very pleased that we have this development.&quot;    Speaking through an American translator, Mr. Shevardnadze said, &quot;I think that what we have done is in the interest of all nations on this planet, and we have no doubt that the summit meeting in Washington will be successful.&quot;    The next step, the Soviet diplomat predicted, would be &quot;toward the abolition of nuclear weapons.&quot;    The two government officials also completed the agenda for three days of summit talks next month between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that will include five working meetings starting Dec. 8 and a White House ceremony for signing the INF treaty.    The treaty, the result of more than 2 1/2 years of effort, would result in the destruction of the missiles and the dismantling of their nuclear warheads over three years. After that, a detailed verification regime that allows both sides to inspect for cheating would continue for an additional 10 years. Verification would help ensure that the missiles, which have a range of between 300 and 3,000 miles, aren't being illegally stockpiled or manufactured.    The inspection regime would permit each country to scrutinize two of the other side's missile plants. Mr. Shultz said the names of the two U.S. missile plants will be disclosed later.    A second measure would permit the U.S. to inspect sites of Soviet SS-25 missiles, longer-range missiles that aren't covered by the INF agreement. The SS-25 missiles have some similarities with SS-20 missiles, which are covered. The U.S., according to Mr. Shultz, would be allowed to examine such sites by &quot;enhanced national technical means.&quot;    If the U.S. suspects an illegal missile is at such a site, he explained, the Soviets would be required to drive their missile carriers out from their protective sheds so U.S. satellites can photograph them.    &quot;This is a very significant step in a good direction,&quot; Mr. Shultz said at a news conference after the discussions were concluded.    A smiling President Reagan, arriving in Denver to give a speech stressing his commitment to his Strategic Defense Initiative, said, &quot;The treaty will be finalized when General Secretary Gorbachev and I meet in Washington next month.&quot; Asked whether he could get the treaty ratified by the Senate, Mr. Reagan replied: &quot;I'll bet we can, yes.&quot;    The INF agreement covers only a small fraction of the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons. Both Messrs. Shultz and Shevardnadze nevertheless hailed it as a first step that may eventually lead to cuts in more lethal, longer-range nuclear weapons and in conventional forces as well.    Indeed, President Reagan continued to hold out hope that he can negotiate an agreement next year cutting strategic missiles 50%, and left open the possibility he will accept some kind of compromise to address Soviet concerns about the SDI program.    In a speech to Martin Marietta Corp. employees working on SDI projects, Mr. Reagan insisted that the program &quot;will not be traded away&quot; to get a strategic-arms pact with the Soviets. But when reporters asked whether Mr. Reagan might delay SDI deployment to get a deal, the president replied: &quot;I'm not going to discuss that right now about SDI.&quot;    The INF accord reached yesterday represents a diplomatic triumph for the two superpowers. The political impact of the agreement, however, will be felt most heavily in Europe, which has become the staging ground for most of the land-based missiles.    The arms race in INF weapons began in the late 1970s after the Soviet Union deployed the SS-20, a weapon with three large and accurate warheads believed to be targeted on cities and military targets in western Europe. Some SS-20s are also based in the Far East, believed to be aimed at targets in China and Japan.    At the request of its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, especially the West Germans, the U.S. responded in the early 1980s by deploying two types of nuclear weapons in Europe. There are 108 Pershing 2s, a ballistic missile that can hit Soviet targets within a few minutes of launch.    The U.S. also has deployed 256 ground-launched cruise missiles in West Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and Belgium and has plans to deploy 208 more by the end of next year. Ratification of the INF agreement by the Senate, expected after some opposition, would halt that deployment.    The deployed U.S. missiles have 350 warheads. The 441 Soviet SS-20s and 132 shorter-range Soviet missiles covered by the treaty have 1,500 warheads. Secretary Shultz said the treaty also covers an unspecified but &quot;substantial&quot; additional number of warheads and missile parts held by both sides in storage. </TEXT></DOC>
