The imaginary part of the effective Lagrangian,which determines the probability of electron-positron pair productionis found. The asymptotic behavior of the effective action is studiedfor supercritical magnetic fields H andgt;andgt; H{sub 0} = m{sup 2}/e with thedependence of the anomalous magnetic moment on H taken into account.</TEXT></DOC>
