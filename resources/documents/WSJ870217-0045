PerryStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP </IN><DATELINE> DUBLIN, Ireland  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Forget all that romantic talk about this fabled Emerald Isle. The real Ireland is a mess.    Unemployment is running at 20% -- and climbing. Real income is down, tax and interest rates are up. The national debt works out to about $10,000 for each man, woman and child. And the Irish once again are voting with their feet; more than 100,000 have emigrated in the past three years, and 200,000 more have applied for U.S. visas. Thousands more didn't wait for proper credentials; they work in the U.S. illegally.    &quot;I suspect the U.S. is getting the brightest young people, the United Kingdom most of the rest,&quot; says Louis Cullen, professor of modern Irish history at Dublin's Trinity College.    Irish voters go to the polls today to elect a new government. But hardly anyone realistically expects the politicians -- Garret FitzGerald's Fine Gael party holds office now -- to cure Ireland's ills. The party that seems likely to win, Charles Haughey's Fianna Fail, hasn't even tried.    Ireland is a country buffeted by scale (it is too small), by history (it was, after all, a colony until 1922, and the island's strife-torn six northern counties are still a part of the U.K.), and by mismanagement (its political leaders plunged the country deeply in debt in good times).    The Irish, numbering 3.5 million, 40% of them on welfare and half of them under 25 years of age, tend to be as good-natured as they are long-suffering. There is rising dissatisfaction here, but, surprisingly, little collective anger. There are no really successful radical political parties on either the left or the right.    &quot;There is a real feeling of hopelessness now,&quot; says Terry Baker, a senior economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute. &quot;What makes it worse is that we were doing so much better, briefly, in the '70s. We just grind away these days, but I am afraid the problem is chronic.&quot;    The government's Industrial Development Authority refuses to accept that Ireland may be sliding into Third World chaos. &quot;Taxes are too high,&quot; says John McKeown, the IDA's executive director. &quot;And we do have a public-debt problem. But there is vibrant activity here too.&quot;    Prove it, he is urged.    The challenge is accepted, and arrangements are made for a visitor to witness &quot;vibrant activity&quot; and talk to the people who are creating new jobs. There is activity here, all right, but it underlines just how vulnerable Ireland is:    The Movie-Maker   Steven Spielberg's animated feature, &quot;An American Tail,&quot; starring a Jewish mouse, is really an Irish tale. Most of the movie was made in Dublin.    The man behind it is 70-year-old Irish-American Morris F. Sullivan, managing director of Sullivan Bluth Studios Ltd., which used to be in California. &quot;We had to move out of the U.S. because of the labor costs,&quot; says Mr. Sullivan. &quot;We came to Ireland because Ireland came up with the best deal.&quot;    Mr. Sullivan brought 65 Americans with him, including one-time Walt Disney animator Don Bluth. Twenty of the Americans are skilled animators. There are also four Irish animators and more than 50 Irish employees who color the individual drawings that make up an animated film.    &quot;We are delighted with our Irish employees,&quot; says Mr. Sullivan. &quot;They show a natural artistic ability we have never seen matched in any other country. They have had very good training.&quot;    Few question the high standards of Irish schools, perhaps the country's greatest success. The problem is there isn't any work for the bright young graduates.    &quot;We are doing our bit,&quot; says Mr. Sullivan. &quot;If our plan works out here, Ireland will be known in a few years as the home of the finest animation in the world.&quot; And there will be 350 or more Irish workers on the payroll. Work has begun on a new, all-Irish feature for Mr. Spielberg, &quot;The Land Before Time Began.&quot;    But there is no guarantee. Will the Americans adapt to cold, wet Dublin after warm, sunny California? &quot;The jury is still out,&quot; admits Mr. Sullivan.    The Soldering Iron   Peter Oglesby invented a portable soldering iron small enough to snap into your coat pocket, like a felt-tipped pen.    With the IDA's help, he set up shop in an industrial park in Carlow, south of Dublin, and his firm, Oglesby andamp; Butler Ltd., churns out 18,000 little portable, butane-powered soldering irons every month.    &quot;It isn't a toy,&quot; says Mr. Oglesby. &quot;It's for professionals. We guarantee its hot-blow tip, using catalytic combustion, will heat up to 400 degrees Centigrade within 30 seconds. You can use it anywhere, and without an electrical outlet -- up on a telephone pole, out in the field, in a boat. There's nothing like it anywhere else in the world.&quot;    The company employs 25 women, just out of school, to assemble the soldering irons. The company estimated it would be making 150,000 soldering irons a year and employing 24 people by 1999. &quot;We're over those targets already,&quot; says Mr. Oglesby.    More than 95% of output is exported, some to the U.S. &quot;We have to export,&quot; says Mr. Oglesby. &quot;There is no domestic market in Ireland. We are so small.&quot;    The company hopes to develop a less-powerful model for the do-it-yourself market. But that takes money, and venture capital in Ireland is hard to come by.    &quot;Marketing,&quot; says marketing director David Scott, &quot;is a bigger problem. We have this marvelous product -- we think it's unique -- but we can't do very much about advertising it.&quot;    So what, eventually, will happen to the Portasol soldering iron?    &quot;Somebody will buy us out,&quot; says Mr. Oglesby. &quot;Some big company. Japanese, probably.&quot;    The National Stud   Ah, now, horses, the Irish passion.    There can hardly be a prettier spot in all of Ireland than the 1,000-acre Irish National Stud at Tully, in County Kildare. It is here the government keeps 10 breeding stallions, each in its own, tidy box with brass nameplate on the door.    It is hardly mentioned these days, but as late as 1943 this was the British National Stud, given to the British Crown in 1915 by Col. William Hall-Walker, who bred horses here at the turn of the century. He kept the horoscopes of each foal. Foals with bad horoscopes were sold. Preposterous, but Col. Hall-Walker was one of Europe's top breeders for 15 years.    The star of the National Stud is the 12-year-old chestnut stallion, Ahonoora. The stud fee for Ahonoora is $30,000 (and he &quot;covers&quot; 60 mares a year), with no refund if it doesn't work. &quot;He's just raking in profits for us,&quot; says Andrew Myers, the stud's assistant manager.    The National Stud exists to improve Irish bloodstock and to help breeders who don't have the same kind of cash as, say, the Aga Khan, whose stud farm is next door. It works, too. The National Stud turned a profit of $540,000 last year.    But, of course, in a country with a $30 billion national debt, it isn't much help. Even so, a government desperate to pay its bills proposes to sell off a big chunk of the National Stud to private investors.    &quot;Stupid,&quot; says Mr. Myers. </TEXT></DOC>
