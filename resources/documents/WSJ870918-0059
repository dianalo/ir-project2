The senators raised difficult issues -- equal protection, the First Amendment, privacy -- and gave their policy views. Judge Bork referred to the text of the Constitution and the leading precedents to give his legal views. Watching the thought processes of the nation's leading jurist has been a real treat.    One great benefit of Judge Bork's view of the proper role for lawyers and judges deserves more attention. The Bork view would curb frivolous litigation. While we can't promise he can single-handedly dampen the litigation explosion, his judicial restraint would halt many predatory uses of the court system by legal opportunists.    This is the lesson of the 1965 case of Griswold v. Connecticut. In bringing up this case, Joe Biden and Ted Kennedy inadvertently drew attention to how activist judges invite litigation. This case, discussed in the nearby excerpts, has been painted as the triumph of Justice William Douglas over Neanderthals opposed to people using contraceptives (see: &quot;'There's a Lot of Privacy in the Constitution'&quot; -- WSJ Sept. 18, 1987). It was nothing of the sort. The real story behind Griswold is how some of Judge Bork's liberal Yale Law School colleagues manufactured a case to give an activist justice a chance to make new law.    In 1879, the Connecticut legislature passed a law against using contraception. Like the California law requiring a hunting license to set a mousetrap, this law immediately fell by the wayside. No police barged into any bedrooms. No one was ever prosecuted for using contraceptives, and people from Greenwich to Hartford were free to use contraceptives.    This did not satisfy everybody in New Haven. Several Yale professors wanted to challenge the law. In the late 1950s, they posted notices asking students to become plaintiffs. A few signed affidavits that they used contraceptives, daring the local prosecutor to bust them. The state prosecutor refused to play this game.    This was a fly in the legal ointment. The Constitution says that courts can only hear &quot;cases&quot; and &quot;controversies.&quot; Any other disagreement is political, to be decided by the elected branches; the professors could have lobbied their representatives to repeal the law. This requirement is key to separation of powers and the reason courts are prohibited from giving &quot;advisory opinions.&quot; Thus, if no one is arrested, there is no case -- no one has &quot;standing&quot; to sue.    The lawyers tried to bring a case anyway, but in 1961 the Supreme Court threw it out as frivolous. In dismissing the case, Poe v. Ullman, Justice Felix Frankfurter said there was a certain &quot;unreality of these lawsuits&quot; because there had been and would be no prosecutions under the &quot;dead words of the written text.&quot;    But the Yale crowd was encouraged by Justice Douglas's dissent that he wanted to take the case. The lawyers decided to try for an arrest under the state law making it a crime to &quot;assist, abet, counsel&quot; anyone to commit an offense. They got an official from the local branch of Planned Parenthood to say the law constrained him from giving advice. They got a friendly prosecutor to make an arrest. As Judge Bork told the senators, &quot;Both sides regarded it as an interesting test case. The whole case was practically an academic exercise.&quot;    Justice Douglas used Griswold to discover a &quot;right to privacy,&quot; based on what he called &quot;penumbras, formed by emanations&quot; from the Bill of Rights. Many legal scholars -- both those who agree and disagree with the result of the case -- have criticized the reasoning as extreme judicial activism. Similar reasoning about privacy in Roe v. Wade has fueled opposition to the abortion ruling.    There are many activist heirs to Justice Douglas. Just this week, federal District Judge Russell Clark usurped the authority of the elected officials in Kansas City, Mo. He has been trying to get magnet schools and higher teacher salaries to attract white students. The voters have rejected several proposals to raise taxes for this. On Wednesday, Judge Clark on his own ordered a doubling of the city's property-tax rate and a 25% increase in the state income tax for city residents. The state will appeal.    The boom in activist judging has spread to torts. Plaintiff lawyers have collaborated with some judges to replace ancient common law with absolute liability. These judges have substituted for the fault requirement in negligence the deep-pocket rule that the defendant always pays. &quot;Standing&quot; requirements have been reduced to encourage class-action suits. The resulting litigation explosion has throttled small business, removed useful drugs from the market, even closed down local baseball fields.    It is no surprise that so many &quot;public-interest&quot; lawyers and vocal lawyers' groups are horrified by Robert Bork's judicial restraint. These lawyers are worried about their livelihoods. But we doubt that most Americans would oppose Judge Bork for his threat to the litigation explosion. </TEXT></DOC>
