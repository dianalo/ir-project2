 All the previous ones are listedon the next page.andP;  The first 13 are available from ACM (*1) in a singleloose-leaf binder to which later procedures may be added.andM;This procedure deals with ethics, in particular with the special ethicalconsiderations in the computer field that arise from the uniquecharacteristics of computers and their use.andM;This is the second procedure that deals with ethics and follows the format ofProcedure IX published in the March 1982 issue and which used the scenariosof Reference 2.andP;  The procedure is short and is neither exhaustive norbalanced in its coverage.andP;  It merely provides a path to some self-assessment.andM;What is Self-Assessment?andM;Self-assessment is based on the idea that a question and answer procedure canbe devised that will help a person appraise and develop his or her knowledgeabout a particular topic.andP;  In the case of ethics, the objective isunderstanding rather than knowledge.andP;  Thus, the objective of this procedureis to help the reader think about ethics and ethical behavior.andM;Self-assessment is intended to be an educational experience for aparticipant.andP;  In this case, the educational experience is to be that whichwill come about as a result of adult conscientious thought.andP;  The scenariosand the associated questions are only the beginning of the procedure.andP;  Thescenarios were selected to help the participant think about the ethicalconcepts and to decide whether to pursue the matter further.andM;The primary motivation of self-assessment is not for an individual to satisfyothers; rather, it is for the participant to appraise and develop himself orherself.andP;  This means that there are several ways to use a self-assessmentprocedure.andP;  The only test of whether the use has been satisfactory is that ifat the end of the procedure the participant can say, &quot;Yes, this has been aworthwhile experience&quot; or &quot;I have gained some understanding.&quot;andM;How to Use this Self-AssessmentandM;ProcedureandM;We suggest the following way of using the procedure, but, as noted earlier,there are others.andP;  This is not a timed exercise; therefore, plan to work withthe procedure when you have an hour to spare, or you will be shortchangingyourself on this educational experience.andM;First reproduce five copies of the page of the Reader Scenario Analysis Formin Part IV.andM;Next read Part I, the Introduction.andP;  It explains why there is a need forspecial ethical considerations in the computer field and listscomputer-specific ethical issues.andM;Then read Part II, the ACM Code of Professional Conduct.andP;  This gives theethical principles, ideals, and rules for behavior considered to beapplicable to ACM members.andM;Now read the first scenario in Part III, pause, deliberate, reach your ownconcllusion, and note your opinions on a copy of the Reader Scenario AnalysisForm reproduced from the form provided in Part IV.andP;  The Committee thinks itwould be particularly appropriate to add a note that would key your analysisto the ACM Code.andM;Consider the scenario in more detail, and try to look at it from differentpoints of view.andP;  See if your analysis leads you to any other thoughts.andO;Revise your analysis form or fill out a new one.andM;No suggested responses are provided, but Part V of the procedure gives thevotes, opinions, and suggested ethical principles applied to each scenario bythe participants in a project described in Reference 1.andP;  You may compare yourconclusion with theirs.andM;Now loop to the next scenario in Part III.andM;The Introduction, scenarios, and panel responses are reprinted from Reference1, which gives the details of how the project was conducted, includes moreextended remarks on ethics, and gives some guidelines for ethical conduct.andO;Reference 3 is the publication in book form of Reference 1.andM;The Committee is particularly anxious to get responses.andP;  You may respondeither by sending in copies of your Reader Scenario Analysis Forms or byletter commenting on any aspect of the matter.andM;The Committee will prepare a summary of the responses and submit it forpublication in Communications and will refer appropriate responses to the ACMCommittee on Professional Standards and Practices.andM;Self-AssessmentandM;Procedure XXIIandM;This self-assessment procedure is not sanctioned as a test or endorsed in anyway by ACM.andP;  Any person using any of the questions in this procedure for thetesting or certification of anyone other than him- or herself is violatingthe spirit of this self-assessment procedure and the copyright on thismaterial.andM;ContentsandM;Part I.andP;  Introduction Part II.andP;  ACM Code of Professional Conduct (By law 19of the Constitution of ACM) Part III.andP;  Scenarios (numbered as in References 1and 3) Part IV.andP;  Reader Scenario Analysis Form Part V.andP;  Panel Responses PartVI.andP;  References and BibliographyandM;PART I.andM;IntroductionandM;We learn our basic ethical principles in the formative years of childhood.andO;As we mature, however, ethics take on new meaning and importance, especiallyas we begin a professional career.andP;  In our chosen field, we are expected toaugment and interpret the ethical values we learned earlier.andP;  This procedureis not intended to change people's ethical values, but rather to assist usersof computer and data communications in clarifying and applying their ethicalvalues as they encounter new, complex situations where it may not be obvioushow ethical values may apply or where the appropriate application of one ofthese values may conflict with other ethical values.andM;Advancements in computer and data communications technology have resulted inthe need to reevaluate the application of ethical principles and establishnew agreements on ethical practices.andP;  The application of ethics ininformation science, technology, and business is more difficult than in otherdisciplines for several reasons.andM;First, computer and data communications alter relationships among people.andO;Data communications take place without personal contact, without the visualand aural senses to help convey meaning.andP;  Moreover, the paperless society, inwhich information is transmitted at electronic speeds, functions side by sidewith the paper-based society, where information is shared at a snail's pace.andO;Conveying one's intentions in a letter, which can take days to reach therecipient, is very different from instantaneous electronic transmissionbecause of how quickly the recipient may act on them.andP;  Communication occursso quickly that one may not have time to consider the implications ofinformation before it has been sent and received.andM;Second, information in electronic, magnetic, and optical form is far morefragile than information on paper.andP;  Computers and data communications systemsprovide for high-speed, low-cost processing, communication, copying, andprinting of intangible intellectual property.andP;  This capability introduces newfactors in decisions about proprietary rights, residual rights, plagiarism,piracy, eaves-dropping, and violation of privacy.andP;  Negative events happen soeasily, sometimes without the initiators' even considering the consequences,that ethical issues are intensified.andP;  Freedom of expression is greatlyleveraged and magnified to the extent that far more good may be done with thecreation, use, and dissemination of information.andP;  Yet it follows that theconsequences of unethical acts are equally magnified.andM;Among computer and data communications users, efforts to protect theintegrity, confidentiality, and availability of information inevitablyconflict with the apparent benefits of sharing information.andP;  The principle of&quot;need to know,&quot; long enforced in national defense, is now prevalent inacademic, research, and business environments; that principle sometimesclashes with the important value of free access to information.andM;Finally, business transactions rely on handwritten signatures, yet nearly allelectronic transactions take place without any signatures.andP;  As automatedmeans for transmitting legally recognized signatures become available,ethical norms will need to change.andM;Unlike the computer field, some sciences and professions have had hundreds ofyears to develop the ethical concepts that form the basis for dealing withnew issues.andP;  They nonetheless continue to wrestle with new and troublesomeethical problems raised by technological advances.andP;  In contrast, computerscience and technology have been in existence for only 30 years.andP;  The needfor ethical standards is equally as critical in computer science, tecnology,and business as it is in other fields.andP;  Given the problems in the ancientsciences, it is little wonder that serious problems arise in developingethical concepts and practices in such a comparatively new field ofknowledge.andM;In addition, ethical issues in the computer field may be more separable andpublic than in medicine and law, which are well-defined professions withlimited membership.andP;  In those professions decisions can often be made out ofpublic view.andP;  On the other hand many more people in widely diverse situationsdecide the ethicality of computer issues.andP;  The general principles discussedin this procedure will often affect average citizens as well as the highlyspecialized professional.andM;Some of the computer-specific ethical issues that have arisen as a result ofthe development of computers include:andM;* Repositories and processors of information.andP;  Unauthorized use of otherwiseun-used computer services or of information stored in computers raisesquestions of appropriateness, fairness, invasion of privacy, and the public'sright to know (freedom of information).andM;* Producers of new forms and types of assets.andP;  Computer programs, forexample, are entirely new types of assets that may not be subject to the sameconcepts of ownership as other assets.andM;* Instruments of acts.andP;  To what degree must providers of computer servicesand users of computers, data, and programs be responsible for the integrityand appropriateness of the computer output?andM;* Symbols of intimidation and deception.andP;  The anthropomorphic view ofcomputers as thinking machines, infallible absolute-truth producers, that yetare subject to blame should be carefully considered.andM;PARTII.andM;ACM Code of ProfessionalandM;Conduct (Bylaw 17 of theandM;Constitution of the ACM)andM;PREAMBLEandM;Recognition of professional status by the public depends not only on skilland dedication but also on adherence to a recognized code of ProfessionalConduct.andP;  The following Code sets forth the general principles (Canons),professional ideals (Ethical Considerations), and mandatory rules(Disciplinary Rules) applicable to each ACM Member.andM;The verbs &quot;shall&quot; (imperative) and &quot;should&quot; (encouragement) are usedpurposefully in the Code.andP;  The Canons and Ethical Considerations are not,however, binding rules.andP;  Each Disciplinary Rule is binding on each individualMember of ACM.andP;  Failure to observe the Disciplinary Rules subjects the Memberto admonition, suspension, or expulsion from the Association as provided bythe Procedures for the Enforcement of the ACM Code of Professional Conduct,which are specified in the ACM Policy and Procedures Guidelines.andP;

 The goal was to determine themethods by which error-free software might be produced on a large-scalebasis.andP;  The professor does not believe that SDI is a viable Department ofDefense program.andP;  She does believe, however, that her work could addmeasurably to the body of scientific knowledge concerning the development oferror-free software.andP;  Thus, she accepted the grant money.andM;Pause, deliberate.andP;

 Preliminary analysis indicatedthat the work was well within the state of the art, and no difficulties wereanticipated with the immediate task.andM;To function properly, or to function at all, however, the software to bedeveloped required inputs from other units in the system.andP;  Someone gave theprofessional an article by an eminent software specialist that convinced himthat the inputs from other units could not be trusted.andP;  Thus, neither thesoftware he was designing nor the unit his company was providing couldcorrectly accomplish their task.andP;

 He accessed one of these computers, using a telephone numberhe had acquired.andP;  Without entering any identification, he received a responsewelcoming him to an expensive and exclusive financial advisory serviceoffered by a large bank.andP;  He was offered free of charge a sample use of someof the services if he would give his name and address.andP;  He provided someoneelse's name and address and used the free promotional services.andP;  Thisstimulated his interest in the services that bank charged for and gave himsufficient knowledge of access protocol to attempt to use the serviceswithout authorization.andP;  He gained access to and examined the menus ofservices offered and instructions for use.andP;  However, he did not use theservices.andP;  By examining the logging audit file and checking with theimpersonated customer, bank officials identified the computer hacker andclaimed that he had used their services without authorization.andM;Pause, deliberate.andP;

 He concluded that he could produce a new package that would befaster, have greater capacity, and offer additional features.andP;  He alsoconcluded that the market would be users of the commercial package that hehad studied; his new product would replace the older one.andP;  The programmerrealized that in some respects he could not improve the existing product andthat compatibility between his product and the existing one would attractusers and minimize the transition to his new product.andM;The programmer went ahead and developed the new product, meeting the higherperformance and new feature capability that he had envisioned.andP;  The keyboardcodes and screen formats (except for the additional features) for the newproduct were the same as those for the existing product.andP;  The computerprogram, however, was different and independently produced.andP;  The new manualwas also entirely different from the existing product manual in content andstyle.andP;  The programmer gave his product a new name but advertised the valueof its compatibility with the existing product.andM;The new product was highly successful.andP;

 The other group used the sametextbook, lectures, and tests, but in addition were the same for bothpractices were the same for both groups.andM;By the middle of the term, the instructor realized that the students in theexperimental group who had access to CAI were doing much better than thestudents in the control group.andP;  Some students in the control group sensedthis difference and complained that, although they paid the same tuition,they were being denied an educational opportunity offered to others.andP;  Thesestudents insisted that the instructor discontinue the experiment and allowthem to use the CAI package for the remainder of the term.andP;  The instructorrefused the students' request on the grounds that ending the experimentprematurely would vitiate the results of the experiment.andP;  The instructorpointed out that only by chance were they in the control group and, becausefree inquiry and research are the nature of the academic world, studentsshould take part willingly in such experiments for the sake of advancingknowledge.andP;

 Their reasons for consideringthe acceptance unethical are that:andM;* Acceptance indicates at least an implicit endorsement of a project shebelieves will not work by a professional who is likely to influence others.andM;* This acceptance sends what the professor believes to be an erroneousmessage (SDI is viable) to the general public.andM;* She is being dishonest with the funding agency, which is unaware of heropinion.andM;These participants concluded that the professor should find some other way tofund her research.andM;The minority contended that her action was not unethical because:andM;* She questioned only the viability, not the morality of SDI.andM;* She did believe that her project was both viable and valuable forscientific knowledge apart from its use in the SDI program.andM;* She does not know whether SDI will work or not.andP;  (Neither does anyoneelse.)andM;* She believes she is acting ethically.andM;Therefore, they argue, belief in SDI itself is irrelevant as long as theprofessor believed that she could deliver the product for which she acceptedthe grant.andP;  On balance, even with the implied SDI endorsement, oneparticipant said the benefits of accepting the grant outweighed thedisadvantages.andM;General PrinciplesandM;Professionals are accountable to the general public and thus have aresponsibility to avoid misleading them.andM;Professionals should not accept funding for research under false pretenses.andM;Professionals must be concerned with the ethics of the actions in which theyare directly involved.andP;  They cannot be held responsible for the unanticipatedpossible misuses of their work by others over whom they have no control.andO;They are obligated, however, to make their doubts and the limitations oftheir work known.andM;Scenario II.6andM;SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: RELYINGandM;ON QUESTIONABLEandM;INPUTSandM;Software Professional: Working on a Project that Depends on QuestionableInputsandM;Total: 20 Unethical: 12 Not Unethical: 7 No Ethics Issue: IandM;OPINIONSandM;The majority of participants maintained that the software professional had aresponsibility to go beyond his supervisor, if necessary, to call attentionto the questionable inputs.andP;  Some discussion centered on the consequences ofusing these data.andP;  If the errors could cause serious harm, the professionalis ethically required to do whatever is necessary to ensure that they arecorrected.andP;  These actions would include notifying someone with broader systemresponsibilities, informing management or the public, and even resigning.andP;  Todo otherwise in such as situation is unethical.andP;  If the consequences would berelatively trivial, the group agreed that telling the supervisor of hisconcerns might be sufficient.andM;The minority opinion was that the software professional acted properly innotifying his supervisor of his concers.andP;  He was not ethically required to domore.andP;  Some participants discussed the ramifications of whistle blowing;frequently, whistle blowers not only lose their jobs, but also are marked forlife.andP;  System deficiencies that cause severe damage warrant atking such arisk, however.andM;General PrinciplesandM;Professionals have a responsibility to do good work and to be accountable forthat work.andP;  They should attempt to remove any impediments to properly doingthe job, including bringing problems to the attention of a higher authority,protesting unreasonable constraints, whistle blowing to an outside agency, oreven resigning.andM;The lengths that profesionals must go to maintain their standard of ethicsdepend on the degree of certainty of the inadequacies and the severity of thedamage that will be caused if those inadequacies are not corrected.andM;Supervisor: Being Concerned with Only One Part of the SystemandM;Total: 22 Unethical: 21 Not Unethical: 1 No Ethics Issue: 0andM;OPINIONSandM;Nearly everyone believed that the supervisor acted unethically if he did notinform management of the deficiencies once he became aware of them.andP;  It isunethical to produce a product known not to work properly.andP;  Both personalintegrity and company loyalty demand that others be alerted to such systemdeficiencies.andM;The one dissenter contended that every person is not responsible foreverything that happens.andP;  An individual can be held responsible only for whatis under his or her control.andM;General PrinciplesandM;Computer professionals must consider their certainty that a problem existsand the severity of the damage that may be caused.andP;  If certainty and severityare both high, professionals must go as far as necessary to see that theproblem is addressed.andM;Professionals are responsible for the context, as well as the particulars, ofthe work they do.andM;Professionals should not agree to perform work that they know cannot besuccessfully completed.andM;Scenario II.11andM;SOFTWARE COMPANY: IGNORINGandM;VOTING MACHINEandM;MALFUNCTIONSandM;Software Engineer: Not Going Beyond Her Immediate SupervisorandM;Total: 24 Unethical: 23 Not Unethical: 1 No Ethics Issue: 0andM;OPINIONSandM;Group members nearly unanimously agreed that doing nothing further would beunethical.andP;  When there is certainty of defects and when those defects couldresult in serious damage, professionals are obliged to take whatever actionis necessary to see that the deficiencies are corrected.andP;  Use of inaccuratevoting machines could invalidate elections and potentially harm the generalpublic.andP;  Even on a pragmatic level, Comapny XYZ's best interests would not beserved by having its software used in inaccurate machines.andP;  Its reputationand future sales may also be damaged when the deficiencies are uncovered.andO;Responsible (ethical) behavior and good business practice are notinconsistent.andP;  The software engineer should pursue the matter further.andP;  Theone individual who disagreed with this view believed that Smith's reportingthe problem to her superior was sufficient, that no further action wasnecessary.andM;Superior: Telling Smith to Ignore the MalfunctionsandM;Total: 24 Unethical: 24 Not Unethical: 0 No Ethics Issue: 0andM;OPINIONSandM;Everyone agreed that the superior acted unethically in failing to follow upon the reported deficiencies.andP;  Professionals have a duty to avoid, or atleast try to avoid, causing harm to the public.andP;  One group member maintainedthat software developers are in a privileged position to detect, and thusprevent, certain kinds of computer malfunctions, even when they are notthemselves the cause.andP;  They, therefore, have a special responsibility totheir clients and to society to ensure that products perform the tasks forwhich they were designed.andM;General PrinciplesandM;When a higher good is at stake in solving a problem, professionals mustaccept responsibility for prudently pursuing solutions.andM;Professionals have a duty to avoid, or at least to try to avoid, causing harmto the public.andM;The extent of the professional's responsibility to solve a problem with aproduct depends on the degree of certainty that the problem exists, the costof solving or avoiding the problem, and the severity of the potential damagesif the problem is not corrected.andP;  When there is certainty of defects and whenthose defects could result in serious damage, professionals are obliged totake action to see that the deficiencies are corrected.andM;Scenario III.1andM;COMPUTER HACKERandM;(BREAKER): ACCESSING COMMERCIALandM;COMPUTER SERVICESandM;Hacker: Scanning TelephoneandM;Numbers for Computer ToneandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 22 Not Unethical: 3 No Ethics Issue: 0andM;OpinionsandM;This entire subgroup and nearly all the general group believed that scanningtelephone numbers for computer response is unethical.andP;  At the very least, itcreates a nuisance, invading the privacy and disturbing the peace of theholders of those telephone numbers.andP;  Curiosity does not justify thisintrusion.andP;  In scanning, the hacker may also have interfered with others'legitimate use of the telephone.andM;Several group members questioned the absence of malice in the hacker'smotives.andP;  (&quot;Hacker&quot; is not necessarily a pejorative term.)andP;  One remarked thatwhat the hacker was doing was akin to testing doors of closed stores at nightto see if any are open: unless the person is a police or security officer onduty, his or her motivation in doing this would certainly be suspect.andO;Another participant commented that calling someone's phone number is wrongexcept in a reasonable attempt to contact that person.andM;One participant asked whether the hacker was a professional and thus could beheld to a standard of professional ethics.andP;  If the hacker was not aprofessional, he should be judged according to traditional concepts of rightand wrong, moral and immoral.andP;  Applying these concepts to this case, thehacker acted immorally and, in some jurisdictions, perhaps even illegally.andM;The few who believed the hacker's action was not unethical granted that hewas a nuisance, but said he was using publicly available access.andP;  This is notunethical if the hacker goes no further, that is, does not use the commercialservice he discovers.andM;Hacker: Accessing a ComputerandM;System after Being &quot;Invited&quot; to DoandM;SoandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 12 Not Unethical: 13 No Ethics Issue: 0andM;OpinionsandM;A bare majority of the general group said that the hacker's accessing thebank's computer system was not unethical under the circumstances; that is,the bank made no effort to prevent entry.andP;  The door was open with aninvitation to enter.andP;  Simply providing a telephone number is a naive way tocontrol access.andM;Nearly as many general group members said that accessing the system was stillunethical.andP;  Having stumbled on the number in the process of scanning (itselfunethical), the hacker was not truly invited to use it by a bankrepresentative.andP;  The bank's failure to provide security does not excuse thehacker's behavior.andP;  His &quot;invitation&quot; was dishonestly acquired.andP;  The hackeralso did not comply with the bank's conditions on the invitation--that heprovide his name and address.andP;  He gave another's name and address, not hisown.andM;Hacker: Using Someone Else'sandM;Name and AddressandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 23 Not Unethical: 1 No Ethics Issue: 1andM;OpinionsandM;All but one group member agreed that using someone else's name and addresswas unethical.andP;  Using someone's name without permission constitutes theft,fraud, and misrepresentation.andP;  By impersonating another, the hackerpotentially exposed that person to charges of unauthorized use of thecomputer.andP;  Some cited this act as clear evidence that the hacker knew thathis previous actions, namely, scanning telephone lines and accessing thecomputer system, were wrong.andP;  Otherwise, they contended, he would nothesitate to use his own name.andP;  The two dissenters gave no rationale for theirpositions.andM;Bank Officers: Claimed theandM;Hacker Used Their Services withoutandM;AuthorizationandM;Subgroup VoteandM;Total: 6 Unethical: 4 Not Unethical: 2 No Ethics Issue: 0andM;OpinionsandM;A subgroup also considered the ethicality of the bank's contention that thehacker had used its services without authorization.andP;  Subgroup members decided4 to 2 that the claim was unethical.andP;  As one remarked, &quot;The bank had no proofthat the hacker had actually used the services, only that he had accessedthem.&quot;andP;  The other side of the argument is that the bank had not provided thehacker with the number and that he had tried to cover his tracks by usinganother's name.andP;  Moreover, the logging audit file showed that the hacker wasin the system; thus, it would be logical to infer that he had used theservices.andM;General PrinciplesandM;One's name confers a right of ownership.andP;  Using another's name withoutpermission is unethical.andM;The right of individual privacy holds that calling someone's telephone numberis wrong unless you are trying to communicate with that person.andM;Computer systems are property, just as an automobile, an office, and a houseare property.andP;  They should be accorded the same respect.andM;Scenario III.3andM;MICROCOMPUTER USER:andM;INADVERTENTLY CONVEYINGandM;COMMERCIAL SOFTWAREandM;IN VIOLATION OFandM;LICENSING AGREEMENTSandM;Programmer: Copying His ProgramandM;Enhancement and CommercialandM;Programs for His FriendsandM;Total: 24 Unethical: 8 Not Unethical: 6 No Ethics Issue: 10andM;OpinionsandM;The majority concurred that no ethics issue was involved in the userinadvertently copying commercial programs; they reasoned that ethics requiresa conscious decision to perform or avoid an action.andP;  People cannot beaccidentally unethical.andP;  The programmer's inadvertent act was human error.andO;It was negligent, but not unethical.andP;  If the user had knowingly copied theprograms, or if he were willfully negligent, he would be acting unethically.andO;Some maintained that if he were a professional computer programmer, hisaction would be negligent, and such behavior would be unethical.andM;Those who believed that he did act unethically said that he failed toexercise due care in handling the property of others.andP;  He should have knownwhat he was copying.andM;Friends: Using the Copied Programs,andM;Including the CommercialandM;PortionsandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 1 Not Unethical: 9 No Ethics Issue: 15/22andM;OpinionsandM;Here again, the majority concurred that no ethics issue was involved in usingthe copied programs.andP;  One participant noted that his friends might haveassumed that the programmer had negotiated the right to distribute theprograms.andP;  They had no way of knowing whether that was true, and noresponsibility to know.andP;  The friends could also be ignorant of copyrightlaws; they night even think that the programs were in the public domainunless the licensing agreement was appended to the program package.andP;  For thesame reasons, some group members voted that such use was not unethical.andM;One individual disagreed with the rest of the group, contending that thefriends were violating property rights whether they knew it or not.andP;  They didsomething wrong and that was unethical, although they might be less culpablethan someone who did the same thing intentionally.andM;General PrinciplesandM;Ethics requires intent.andP;  If the intent to do or not do something is notpresent, no ethical issue is involved.andP;  Responsibility requires knowledge inethics, if not in law.andM;Professionals should exercise due care in handling the property of others.andM;Professionals are expected to know and abide by relevant laws and contractualagreements.andM;Scenario III.5andM;PROGRAMMER: PRODUCINGandM;NEW SOFTWARE BUILT ONandM;AN EXISTING SYSTEMandM;Programmer: Piggy-Backing onandM;Existing Software Product WithoutandM;PermissionandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 1 Not Unethical: 22 No Ethics Issue: 2andM;OpinionsandM;A large majority of the participants viewed the programmer's producing a newsoftware package built on an existing product as not unethical.andP;  Suchimprovements, they argued, are at the heart of competition.andP;  The primaryquestion is whether copyright laws were violated; most believed they werenot.andP;  The programmer did not steal code or any other proprietary information.andO;(Most did not consider the keyboard commands and screen formats proprietary.)andO;The programmer's new software could be likened to reverse engineering, whichthe participants considered well within the bounds of fair competition.andP;  Thefact that the company that owned the original product complained, but did notsue, seemed to bear out their contention that no copyright infringementoccurred.andM;One group member disagreed, arguing that the programmer should have obtainedpermission to use the keyboard commands and screen formats and paid royaltieson them.andP;  Two group members considered this case a legal, rather than anethics, issue.andP;  As one stated, &quot;This situation is no different than any otherproduct innovation.&quot;andM;General PrinciplesandM;Significant improvement of a software product results in a new product andshould be treated as one.andP;  (In the case of unpatented, but possiblycopyrighted software, the new program is assumed to be different andindependently produced; that is, no proprietary or copyrighted property ofanother, such as source code, has been stolen.)andP;  This is true even when thefunction of the new product is similar to the original.andP;  (*3)andM;Public formats, conventions, and standards are not copyrightable anymore thanare the general shapes of other products such as cars or coffee makers.andM;Innovation must be encouraged for the good of society; therefore, individualsshould be rewarded for being innovative.andM;Scenario IV.andP;  6andM;PROGRAMMER: DEVELOPINGandM;MARKETING PROFILES FROMandM;PUBLIC INFORMATIONandM;Programmer: Developing and Marketing Sometimes Invalid Consumer ProfilesandM;Total: 26 Unethical: 8 Not Unethical: 15 No Ethics Issue: 3andM;OpinionsandM;Some members came to opposite conclusions about the ethicality of sellingconsumer profiles compiled from publicly available sources.andP;  Although no oneliked the practice and some had personal experience with the annoyance ofjunk mail, the group majority could find nothing unethical in theprogrammer's action.andP;  (One offered the caveat that it was not unethicalprovided the programmer did not represent his information as more accuratethan it was.)andP;  They assumed that all information used was public (and thusinvolved no invasion of privacy) and not gathered by illegal or surreptitiousmeans.andP;  Selling mailing lists and membership lists for use in direct mail andtelemarketing is common practice.andP;  No harm is done; if people receive mailthey do not want, they can simply throw it away.andM;Those who decided that no ethics issue was involved essentially agreed withthe majority.andP;  (They also assumed that the profiles were based on publicinformation.)andP;  As one member said, &quot;While the action was annoying and sleazy,it was not ethically impermissible.&quot;andP;  Another focused on the quality of theprofiles produced, contending that ignorance of one's incompetence is not anethical issue either.andP;  However, both believed that standards of professionalethics require a certain degree of competency.andP;  The minority view was thatcompiling these profiles was an invasion of privacy.andM;Unethical acts require intent.andP;  If the programmer did not know that hisprofiles were inaccurate and was, therefore, unintentionally causing hisclients to waste money and those profiled to have overflowing mailboxes, hewould not be acting unethically.andM;General PrinciplesandM;Use of the computer as a marketing tool is not, per se, unethical.andM;Using personal information for purposes other than originally intended isunethical.andM;Use of publicly available, legitimately acquired information is ethical.andM;Scenario IV.7andM;INSTRUCTOR: USING STUDENTSandM;AS SUBJECTS OF ANandM;EXPERIMENTandM;Instructor: Using Students as Subjects of ExperimentsandM;Total: 27 Unethical: 21 Not Unethical: 4 No Ethics Issue: 2andM;OpinionsandM;The group overwhelmingly asserted that the instructor acted unethically.andO;First, the experiment harmed the subjects in the control group.andP;  Their gradeswere significantly lower than those in the group using CAI, a situation thatcould affect their chances of getting or maintaining a scholarship orentering the graduate school of their choice.andP;  Second, the instructor did notget the students' informed consent.andP;  Such consent is a normal requirement forany research experiment involving human subjects.andM;The minority who voted that using the students in an experiment was notunethical did not accept the contention that the students were harmed.andP;  Theysuggested that using two different classes rather than dividing one classinto two parts would have been wiser, but pilot testing a new tool orprocedure to see if it works before using it on the whole student body isonly good pedagogical practice.andP;  Another argued that it was not really anexperiment in the psychological sense.andM;Instructor: Refusing Students' Request to Discontinue the ExperimentandM;Total: 26 Unethical: 23 Not Unethical: 3 No Ethics Issue: 0andM;OpinionsandM;An even larger majority believed strongly that the instructor should haveterminated the experiment when the students complained.andP;  One group membereven argued that he should have been fired for refusing.andP;  Once the instructordetermined that the control group was placed at a disadvantage, he shouldhave given them an opportunity to recover.andP;  Even if they had initiallyconsented to participate, the instructor acted unethically when he did nothonor their request to discontinue the experiment.andP;  If the instructor hadtaken steps to mitigate the grading inequities, some members of the groupmight have voted differently.andM;The few who considered the instructor's action not unethical contended thatthe students take their chances with different instructors who use differentbooks (or even the same books) for the same course.andP;  It might be argued thatlast year's class, for example, which did not have access to CAI, was alsoharmed.andP;  It is an imperfect world and likely to remain so.andM;General PrinciplesandM;The informed consent of human subjects is required before they can be usedfor any research experiment.andM;When deleterious effects are seen, the experiment should be stopped.andP;  To theextent possible, these negative effects should be reversed.andM;Human subjects have the right to withdraw from any experiment regardless ofwhether they initially gave informed consent.andM;Scenario IV.8andM;UNIVERSITY STUDENT: OFFERINGandM;LIMITED ACCESS TOandM;A PORNOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIREandM;Student: Making a Pornographic Questionnaire Available to Other StudentsandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 1 Not Unethical: 21 No Ethics Issue: 3andM;OpinionsandM;Most believed that providing the questionnaire to other students was notunethical.andP;  Although the questionnaire might be in bad taste, no one wasforced to read it.andP;  The student clearly identified its contents and warnedthat some people might be offended.andP;  Those accessing it did so with informedconsent, not accidentally or under any duress, and need not submit theiranswers to anyone or even compete the questionnaire at all.andM;The one dissenter contended that those answering the questionnaire were beingexploited.andP;  Unless the student or some other party made use of completedquestionnaires, group members did not view the questionnaire's availabilityas exploiting anyone.andM;Dean of Students: Threatening the Student with ExpulsionandM;Total: 26 Unethical: 17 Not Unethical: 2 No Ethics Issue: 7andM;OpinionsandM;A clear majority concurred that unless the student behaved unethically orviolated rules prohibiting such use of the computer, the Dean of Studentsacted unethically in threatening him for his action.andP;  Under thecircumstances, the dean abused his power and violated the student's right offreedom of speech.andP;  Those participants who believed that the threat was notunethical or not an ethics issue said it was simply an overreaction; anothercalled it poor judgment.andP;  Universities, more than other institutions, mustencourage and protect free speech.andP;  Fears of offending alumni contributors orpotential public embarrassment may be factors in determining policy, butshould not be decisive.andP;  No apparent prohibition against particular uses ofthe bulletin board existed, and instituting a policy of censorship would be amistake.andP;  Any short-term gain achieved would weaken values that arefundamental to universities and society as a whole.andM;General PrinciplesandM;Especially in educational institutions, freedom of speech is critical.andP;  It isfar more important than avoiding embarrassment or risking negative alumnireaction.andM;A student should be held to observance of professional ethics as part of hisor her education.andP;  However, forgiveness should be liberally applied andsanctions limited.andM;Scenario V.2andM;COMPUTER SCIENTIST: DIVERTINGandM;RESEARCH FUNDSandM;Computer Scientist: Diverting Research MoneyandM;Total: 26 Unethical: 14 Not Unethical: 7 No Ethics Issue: 5andM;OpinionsandM;The majority found the diversion of research funds to be unethical.andP;  Thatmany people do this does not make it right or acceptable.andP;  Given thecircumstances, the computer scientist should have discussed the problem withhis manager and perhaps requested permission from the granting agencies toimplement his plan.andP;  If he had made a good case for the two projects'interrelatedness, most likely permission would have been granted.andM;Alternatively, the computer scientist could have applied for more funding.andO;In this case, he would have been acting ethically as well as avoidingconsiderable unpaid overtime work.andP;  By taking unilateral action, he put notonly himself but also his organization at risk.andP;  An audit might have revealedthe diversion and exposed him and his organization to legal liability and badpublicity, as in the case of time card manipulation by defense contractors.andM;Those who considered his action to be not unethical had a variety of reasons.andO;One reasoned that accounting for time and charges is often arbitrary.andP;  Thesecond project would have benefited from the computer scientist's getting upto speed on the first project.andP;  The first project, therefore, would bear adisproportionate part of the development costs.andP;  Another participantconsidered this issue more a matter of business regulation than ethics.andO;Besides, no harm was done, and both clients were satisfied with the results.andO;In fact, one client (unknowingly) received the benefit of additional work forno additional cost.andM;Those who voted that this was not an ethics issue also had divergent views.andO;One said that the diversion was illegal and therefore beyond ethicalconsiderations.andP;  Another said it was simply poor management.andP;  A thirdbelieved it was not an issue because it was standard practice.andM;General PrinciplesandM;Contractual agreements should be honored.andM;The ends do not justify the means.andM;&quot;Everybody's doing it&quot; is no excuse for unethical behavior.andM;Good contracting and business practices entail anticipating ethical issuesand obtaining informed consent (when necessary) in advance of performingwork.andM;Scenario V.6andM;SOFTWARE DEVELOPER:andM;ENCROACHING ON A CONSULTANT'SandM;BUSINESS WITHandM;AN EXPERT SYSTEM APPLICATIONandM;Software Developer: Selling Expert System to Potential Clients of theApplication DeveloperandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 1 Not Unethical: 20 No Ethics Issue: 4andM;OpinionsandM;Practically everyone agreed that the software developer did not actunethically in selling the system to the developer's clients.andP;  He hadcontracted with the consultant to develop the application and presumably hadpaid for the work.andP;  The consultant should have known that the application'susers would be potential clients and taken action to protect himself.andP;  Forexample, he could have negotiated a contract with royalties, some form ofproperty rights, or limitations on the application to be developed to certainaspects of his expertise.andP;  Some participants questioned whether theconsultant did in fact retain any ownership of the application.andP;  If he did,then it would be unethical for the developer to sell it without recompensingthe consultant.andM;A few viewed the sale as strictly the result of a business arrangement;therefore, it was not an ethics issue.andP;  The consultant exercised poorjudgment in agreeing to develop the application.andP;  Ethics cannot saveindividuals from the consequences of their own unwise business decisions.andM;Consultant: Holding Back Some of His ExpertiseandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 1 Not Unethical: 24 No Ethics Issue: 0andM;OpinionsandM;Only one member of the group thought that holding back expertise would beunethical if the developer knew about it.andP;  The dissenter contended that byaccepting the assignment, the consultant should do the best job possible.andO;If, on the other hand, the consultant withheld expertise without thedeveloper's knowledge and agreement, 24 of the 25 group members consideredthat action unethical.andM;General PrinciplesandM;Ethics cannot and are not intended to protect individuals from theconsequences of their own business decisions.andP;  Rather, ethics are meant to bea standard for the behavior of professionals.andM;Ethics requires that professionals deliver the product agreed to in thecontract.andM;Secretly withholding part of one's expertise that one has contracted toprovide is unethical.andM;Scenario V.7andM;PRESIDENT OF SOFTWAREandM;DEVELOPMENT COMPANY:andM;MARKETING A SOFTWAREandM;PRODUCT KNOWN TO HAVEandM;BUGSandM;President: Marketing Software that Has BugsandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 24 Not Unethical: 0 No Ethics Issue: 1andM;OpinionsandM;Nearly everyone contended that marketing a software product known to havebugs that may harm users is unethical.andP;  They reasoned that when packaged (asopposed to custom) software is sold to the consumer, the developer shouldhave exercised due diligence to find and correct as many bugs as reasonablypossible.andP;  Any remaining ones should be of the sort that surface only afterwidespread use.andP;  To comply with minimum industry standards, the president,therefore, should have field-tested the product and corrected anydeficiencies that were found before offering it for sale.andP;  Participantsassumed that no field test was conducted and therefore branded his actionunethical.andP;  It would also have been unethical, having completed testing andfinding errors, to market the software without correcting those errors.andM;The individual who said marketing the product with bugs was not an ethicsissue commented that only money was involved.andM;President: Marketing Product with Disclaimer of ResponsibilityandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 19 Not Unethical: 5 No Ethics Issue: 1andM;OpinionsandM;The group's consensus was that although a disclaimer is standard industrypractice because of the current legal interpretation of product liability, itis meant to protect developers against unknown product deficiencies, notproblems resulting from known bugs.andP;  Using the disclaimer in this way is anabuse and therefore unethical.andM;The minority that voted not unethical stressed the disclaimer's use asstandard industry practice.andM;President: Arguing that His Action is General Industry PolicyandM;Total: 24 Unethical: 18 Not Unethical: 2 No Ethics Issue: 4andM;OpinionsandM;Although the majority agreed that the president's argument was unethical,several either considered it not unethical or not an ethics issue.andP;  Themajority argued that being industry policy does not necessarily make anaction right.andP;  Moreover, at least one participant suggested that thepresident, in calling his action general industry policy, was, in fact,lying.andP;  Marketing software known to contain bugs is not general industrypolicy.andM;Several participants said that arguing, in and of itself, cannot be unethicalunless the arguments used are lies.andP;  Freedom of speech guarantees certainrights.andP;  They did concede that the president's argument did not contain anyvalid justification for his actions.andM;General PrinciplesandM;Any intentional misrepresentation of a product is unethical.andM;Professionals are responsible for the foreseeable consequences of thepublic's use of their products.andM;An act that is considered to be standard industry practice is not necessarilyethical.andM;Scenario VI.3andM;RESEARCH TEAM MEMBER:andM;CIRCUMVENTING FEDERALandM;REGULATIONSandM;Team Member: Discussing Problem with Eastern Bloc Scientist in Violation ofRegulationsandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 19 Not Unethical: 3 No Ethics Issue: 3andM;OpinionsandM;A significant majority agreed that discussing a scientific problem withanyone, knowing that it violated regulations, is unethical.andP;  They consideredwhether the team member could have gained important insights into potentialsolutions without revealing at least the nature of the problem.andP;  Some membersdecided that it would be impossible to reveal the nature of a problem withoutrunning the risk of communicating exactly what the regulation was created toprevent.andP;  Even if the information gathered is useful for solving the problem,they argued that the team member has still acted unethically.andM;A few participants believed that informal discussions that avoid transmittingany secrets are feasible.andP;  The majority disagreed, however.andM;Some did not care whether the team member knew that his discussion wouldviolate regulations, although that knowledge did make a difference to a fewmembers of the general group.andP;  However, even if the researcher had not heardof the regulation, the majority still believed that his action was unethical.andO;It was his responsibility to know of it.andP;  Any doubts could have been resolvedby checking with someone before the discussion was initiated.andP;  One of thedissenters thought it was not unethical to circumvent a ridiculous law.andO;Another participant commented that perhaps more would be gained, even livessaved, by getting insights from the Eastern Bloc computer scientist.andM;General PrinciplesandM;People who have agreed to abide by specified conditions of employment (e.g.,andO;regulations governing use of classified or proprietary information) areethically required to do so, all other things being equal.andP;  When in doubt asto whether the conditions apply in certain circumstances, they are obliged toclarify the situation before acting.andM;Scenario VI.6andM;INFORMATION SECURITYandM;MANAGER: MONITORINGandM;ELECTRONIC MAILandM;Information Security Manager: Monitoring Electronic Correspondence ofEmployeesandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 14 Not Unethical: 11 No Ethics Issue: 0andM;OpinionsandM;Monitoring email was considered to be unethical according to a narrowmajority of group members because the employees apparently had no warningthat they might be monitored or that their use of the system was restricted.andO;They were thus less likely to send discrete messages.andP;  Under thecircumstances, management was taking unfair advantage of the employees.andO;Furthermore, some participants argued that email should be given the samerights to privacy as postal mail.andM;The sizeable minority who voted that the information security manager did notact unethically noted the considerable differences between U.S.andP;  postal mailand email.andP;  Email, as well as telephone systems and internal mail in theworkplace, are company property and resources.andP;  No rights of privacy extendto individuals using property or resources supplied for a company (as opposedto personal) business.andP;  Email is also by its nature more accessible thanother forms of communication.andP;  Finally, they argued that the monitoring ofall communication forms is necessary for management control of its resources,particularly when a company has trade secrets or clarified information toprotect.andM;Information Security Manager: Informing Management of AbuseandM;Total: 14 Unethical: 22 Not Unethical: 2 No Ethics Issue: 0andM;OpinionsandM;Giving management printouts of the actual messages is quite different.andO;Although a summary of the types of calls made would be acceptable, all buttwo considered it highly unethical to provide others with the detailedcontent of clearly personal messages.andP;  The right to privacy is the centralethical principle.andP;  Material security considerations do override privacyconsiderations, but what the security manager is reporting has nothing to dowith security (unless the relationships make individuals vulnerable toblackmail).andP;  Even then, in the absence of a prohibition on the personal useof the email system, providing the messages verbatim to management isunethical.andM;The two individuals who did not consider the action unethical reiterated thatemployees have no right to expect privacy in email.andP;  The facility is meantfor business communications and is subject to management scrutiny.andM;Employees: Using Electronic Mail System for Personal CommunicationsandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 10 Not Unethical: 10 No Ethics Issue: 4andM;OpinionsandM;The group was divided on the ethicality of using email for personal purposes.andO;More than half believed that type of use was not unethical or not an ethicsissue based on the absence of a clearly stated company policy forbidding theuse of email for other than company business.andP;  Several participats assertedthat if the company explicitly prohibited personal use, the employees wouldbe acting unethically.andP;  Such use would also be unethical if it interferedwith the employees' job performance.andP;  Otherwise, according to some, personaluse of email might be indiscrete or unwise, but not unethical.andP;  Employeesshould realize that the system can be monitored and, if securityconsiderations are involved, probably is.andP;  Some participants characterizedbetting information as not personal or private, particularly given itsillegality.andM;A sizeable minority contended that employees' personal use of corporateresources was unethical prima facie.andP;  It is a misuse of corporate facilitiesand could reduce system effectiveness.andP;  One participant believed that thiscould constitute petty larceny or even a felony.andP;  Unless a a clear policypermits personal use, employees should treat email resources the same aspetty cash or a company car.andM;Information Security Manager: Failing to Ask for Rules on Personal Email Usefrom ManagementandM;Total: 24 Unethical: 11 Not Unethical: 3 No Ethics Issue: 10andM;Top Management: Failing to Set Rules and Inform EmployeesandM;Total: 23 Unethical: 20 Not Unethical: 2 No Ethics Issue: 1andM;OpinionsandM;The majority opinions on rule setting reflect the relative obligations andresponsibilities of the information security manager and top management.andO;These participants argued that management is responsible for setting clearpolicies, defining the consequences of violating them, and ensuring that eachemployee understands them.andP;  Depending on a policy's importance, managementmay even insist that employees sign an acknowledgment that they have beenbriefed and understand the policy.andP;  The policy should then be appliedconsistently.andP;  Therefore, most group members believed that enforcing anunstated or fuzzy policy that violated employees' apparent expectations ofprivacy is unethical.andP;  Those who disagreed iterated that email by its natureis not private and cannot be compared to the U.S.andP;  Postal Service.andM;Conversely, a majority argued that the information security manager is notresponsible for ensuing that policies are set up or promulgated, but only forcarrying them out.andP;  For this reason, all the subgroup maintained that he didnot act unethically, and a majority of the general group decided that hisfailure to ask for a rule on personal email use was either not unethical orno ethical issue was involved.andP;  A significant minority did not think theinformation security manager was ethically obliged to ask for a clear,publicized policy from management.andP;  In its absence, however, he is actingunethically by monitoring the email because the lack of a policy infers thatthe employees' privacy will be respected.andM;Top Management: Punishing Some Employees Based on the Content of Their EmailMessagesandM;Total: 25 Unethical: 23 Not Unethical: 0 No Ethics Issue: 2andM;OpinionsandM;Almost everyone contended that imposing a penalty based on message contentwas unethical for several reasons.andP;  First, employees apparently did not knowthat their email would be monitored.andP;  It would be appropriate to punishemployees for violations of a clearly stated and well-promulgated companypolicy, but not for one they were unaware existed.andM;Second, because management knew the actual contents of the messages, theyseemed to be applying employee sanctions based on behavior indicated by themessage content rather than for misuse of email.andP;  Management acted improperlyin disciplining employees for non--job-related aspects of their personallives.andP;  this was a violation of the employees' right to privacy and freedomof action in their personal lives.andM;Third, because employees were punished &quot;in some cases,&quot; management againappeared to be acting on the content of the message rather than theunauthorized use of company resources.andP;  Such disciplinary actions are alsoarbitrary.andP;  Management should be consistent in applying sanctions.andM;If the information security manager had given management a simple list ofthose who were using email for personal reasons, if the employees knew suchuse was against company policy, and if penalties were applied consistently,then, according to the participants, management would be acting well withinits authority.andP;  Otherwise, management acted unethically.andM;General PrinciplesandM;Employers have a right to limit or prohibit employees' use of companyresources.andP;  However, these limits must be clear, must be made known to allemployees in advance, and must be consistently enforced.andM;In the absence of a policy forbidding use of email or other intraofficecommunications, reading communications intended for others is a violation ofprivacy.andM;It is wrong to monitor employees' personal communications without theirknowing that monitoring is at least a possibility.andP;  It is an invasion ofprivacy.andP;  However, employees' consent, beyond their deciding to continuetheir employment with the company, is not necessary.andM;When using company email, individuals should realize that by nature it is notprivate.andP;  It is inherently more accessible and more open to others' perusalthan other intraoffice mail.andM;Employers have no right to impose sanctions on employees for non--job-relatedbehavior.andM;When personal habits interfere with job performance, they become legitimatemanagement concerns.andP;  Otherwise, employees have the right to privacy andfreedom of action in their personal lives.andM;A company has the right ro engage in surveillance of employees whensuspicions of explicit wrong-doings cannot prudently be ignored.andM;Unauthorized use of company resources may be construed as petty larceny oreven a felony, e.g., California Penal Code Section 502--unauthorized use byan employee of over $100 of computer services.andM;A security officer has a right and duty to act on information clearlyinimical to his or her employer's legitimate and ethical business interests.andM;Scenario: V1.7andM;EMPLOYER: MONITORINGandM;AN INFORMATION WORKER'SandM;COMPUTER USAGEandM;Top Manager: Allowing Employees to use Computer Services for ApprovedPersonal PurposesandM;Total: 28 Unethical: 0 Not Unethical: 9 No Ethics Issue: 19andM;OpinionsandM;The group agreed that no ethics issue was involved in the decision to allowor prohibit the use of office computers for personal purposes.andP;  Because thecomputer services belonged to the company, its managers could determine howthe equipment would be used.andP;  By approving of such personal uses, themanagers are in effect providing another company benefit to the employees.andO;Those who described the policy as not unethical essentially agreed with themajority.andP;  No one considered this action to be unethical.andM;Top Manager: Directing Security Department to Monitor Computer ServicesandM;Total: 27 Unethical: 24 Not Unethical: 1 No Ethics Issue: 2andM;OpinionsandM;A substantial majority believed that monitoring the computer services withoutthe employees' knowledge was unethical.andP;  Although employers argue forcontrolling everything in the workplace because they pay for it, thisparticular action is an unjustifiable violation of employee privacy.andM;At issue is the principle of respect, participants insisted.andP;  Theemployer/employee relationship is essentially a contract.andP;  For a contract tobe ethical, both parties to the agreement must understand what they areagreeing to and freely choose to make the agreement.andP;  Furthermore, becausemanagement controls the workplace (i.e., makes the rules/policy), managementis in a better position to explain the conditions of employment than theemployee is to ask all the right questions.andP;  If management informed theworkers that they could, with permission, use the computer services forpersonal activities and at the same time advised them that these uses mightbe monitored, then the action would not be unethical.andM;Those who considered it not unethical to monitor the employees secretly saidthat the action was justified by security concerns over the merger.andP;  Thosewho decided that no ethics issue was involved based their decision onmanagement's prerogative within the workplace.andM;General PrinciplesandM;Employers have a right to set policy.andP;  However, when the policy directlyaffects employees, the employer must make them aware of the relevant terms oftheir employment.andP;  To do so otherwise is unethical.andM;Workplace surveillance without employees' knowledge to detect &quot;unrest&quot; is aninvasion of privacy and highly unethical.andM;(*1) Order number 203840.andP;
