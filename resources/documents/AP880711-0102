The attack was described by prosecutors as a neo-Fascist plot toundermine Italy's democracy.   The court also convicted two defendants of slander: FrancescoPazienza, the ex-financier linked to several criminal cases inItaly, and Licio Gelli, the ex-grandmaster of the secret PropagandaDue (P-2) Masonic lodge.   The lodge allegedly backed right-wing terrorism and its membersincluded politicians, military men and leading industrialists.   But the court, citing insufficient evidence, acquitted Gelli andPazienza of a more serious charge of subversive association.   The verdicts came after a 1{-year trial in which 200 witnessestestified.   The Aug. 2, 1980 attack in this northern Italian city injured200 people and demolished the waiting room filled with holidaytravelers at the station.   Prosecutors said the terrorists hoped the massacre would helpthrow Italy into confusion, paving the way for an eventual rightistdictatorship. They said some of the defendants, who were members ofItaly's secret services at the time of the attack, aided theterrorists.   The jury, led by Judge Mario Antonacci, said the four defendantswho received life sentences _ Italy's stiffest penalty _ wereconvicted of mass murder for by carrying out the bombing. They areValerio Fioravanti; his wife, Francesca Mambro; MassimilianoFachini; and Sergio Picciafuoco.   Acquitted of the massacre charge for lack of evidence were PaoloSignorelli and Roberto Rinani. Prosecutor Libero Mancusa hadaccused Signorelli, a professor, of masterminding the bombing.   But Signorelli was convicted of belonging to an armed band _ ablanket terrorism charge used by Italian prosecutors _ andsentenced to 12 years in prison, and Rinani got a six-year sentencefor conviction on the same charge.   In all, eight defendants were convicted and three acquitted oncharges of belonging to an armed band. Sentences ranged from six to16 years.   In addition, 11 defendants were acquitted of subversiveassociation.   Among those acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence of chargesof subversive association were Stefano delle Chiaie, a reputedleading right-wing terrorist, and two former officials of Italy'ssecret service police force SISMI: Gen. Pietro Musumeci and Col.Giuseppe Belmonte.   After convicting Gelli, Pazienza and the two former secretservice officials of aggravated slander, the court sentenced Gellito five years in prison and the other three to three years each.   Gelli won't have to serve his sentence, however. Under terms ofhis extradition last year from Switzerland, he can only be tried inItaly on charges connected to the 1982 collapse of the Milan-basedBanco Ambrosiano, Italy's largest post-war banking scandal. He wasalready being tried in absentia when the extradition agreement withSwitzerland was made.   Pazienza was arrested in New York in 1985 and extradited oncharges of fraud in the Banco Ambrosiano case.   The slander charge was based on a 1981 incident, in whichexplosives similar to the kind used in the 1980 bombing were foundon a train at Bologna's station. The prosecutor contended Gelli,Pazienza, Musumeci and Belmonte misled investigators intoconcluding the explosives found in 1981 were linked to otherrightists terrorists in Italy and West Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
