The decision harks back to a ruling made in March, inwhich a federal district judge in Austin, Texas, orderedMotorola to stop selling its 68030 chip because it infringedon patents held by Japan's Hitachi Ltd. The ruling also foundHitachi in violation of certain Motorola patents. The judgethen issued a stay of the injunction, allowing Motorola andHitachi to keep selling their chips.</LP><TEXT>   The judge yesterday disclosed his intent to lift the stay,Motorola and Hitachi officials said. The judge hadn't yetsigned the order yesterday but is scheduled to do so today, aHitachi official said.   If enforced, the decision could be disastrous forMotorola, which would be forced immediately to stop sellingits flagship 68030 microprocessor chip, used in powerfulcomputers made by such companies as Apple Computer Inc. andHewlett-Packard Co. The 68030 chip is the &quot;brains&quot; of many ofApple's Macintosh machines.   Motorola officials said in a written statement that itwill file an emergency appeal with the U.S. Court of Appealsto stay the injunction. The ruling &quot;might temporarily preventthe company from selling its market-leading 68030,&quot; thestatement said. Motorola is &quot;confident&quot; that the appealscourt will &quot;promptly stay the lower court's decision, pendingappeal.&quot;   A Hitachi official said that &quot;Hitachi is continuing tomeet {with Motorola} in an effort to reach a negotiatedsettlement&quot; with Motorola. &quot;We want to do all we can towardreaching a settlement,&quot; he said.   Hitachi has little to lose. The giant conglomerate, whichrequested the lifting of the stay, won't be hurt much by theinjunction because it sells few of the chips in the U.S. thatwere found to be violating Motorola patents. &quot;There will bevery little effect on Hitachi,&quot; the Hitachi official said. Infact, many U.S. chip executives say Hitachi has the upperhand in any negotiations and may be using the injunction toget more favorable treatment from Motorola.   The ruling could also hurt Apple and others that use thechip, which only Motorola makes. Companies in March said theyhad several months' worth of stockpiles of the vital chip,but some warned Motorola that they would be angered by acutoff of supply. An Apple spokesman said the companycouldn't comment on yesterday's news until it had seen a copyof the formal ruling.   A Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman said the company wouldn't beaffected because it has a license to use the Hitachi patentand to commission chip makers to make semiconductors forHewlett-Packard that use the patent.   The ruling is the latest twist in an 18-monthtrans-Pacific patent battle, started by Motorola, in whichMotorola and Hitachi have launched a barrage of suits andcountersuits. The March ruling, in which the judge chided thecompanies for not agreeing out of court, backfired againstMotorola, shocked the computer industry and even caused oneuser of the chip to guard its stockpiles with extra securityguards.   Motorola also said yesterday that the U.S. Patent Officeagreed last week to reexamine Hitachi's patent, whichMotorola claims is invalid on the basis of a 1966 patent. Thepatent office has found that &quot;a substantial new questionabout {the} Hitachi patent has been raised which has a directbearing on the outcome of this case,&quot; the Motorola statementsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
