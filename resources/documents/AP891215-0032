Trading was inactive because of the expected release laterFriday of monthly U.S. economic figures, including trade data forOctober and producer prices and industrial production data forNovember, dealers said.   The Nikkei slipped shortly after trading began as marketplayers, who were already worried about the speed of recent risesin the index, stepped to the sidelines. But it recovered laterafter intermittent index-buying by foreign securities firms, thedealer said.   Index-buying is a tactic that involves the purchase of at least1,000 shares in all 225 Nikkei issues.
