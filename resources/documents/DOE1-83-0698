The reduction conditions wereat typical stack gas temperatures (less than 200 degrees C), with hydrogenused as the reducing gas. In this work, reversible and irreversible modesof SO{sub 2} poisoning are identified. For the conditions studied inthis paper, Pt is irreversibly poisoned by small pulses of SO{sub 2},while poisoning of Rh and Pd with pulses of SO{sub 2} is reversible.When treated with a feed stream containing 850 ppm of SO{sub 2}, allthree catalysts were poisoned irreversibly and could not be regeneratedby hydrogen or air at 300 degrees C. During poisoning, reaction selectivitydecreases for N{sub 2} and increases for N{sub 2}O with Pd and Rh butdoes not change with Pt. 12 refs., 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
