ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oliver North conceded Friday he lied tocongressmen who came to the White House to question him about theContras, but he said he didn't think it was unlawful because thethings he was hiding, ``I was told, could not, should not berevealed.''   ``I felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by giants,''he testified.   The courtroom at his criminal trial was packed and long linesformed in the hallway outside as the former National SecurityCouncil aide spent his second day in the witness chair, undergoinggentle examination by his own lawyer, Brendan Sullivan.   At the White House, meanwhile, President Bush, citing concernabout ``endangering the trial,'' refused to answer questions abouthis own role in aiding the Contras, as disclosed in a lengthy``admission of facts'' introduced by North's lawyers on Thursday.   The court statement, agreed to by both the government andNorth's lawyers, said Bush got several North memoranda regardingthe secret operation to aid the Contras and also flew to Hondurasto tell that nation's president of expedited U.S. aid _ which wasaimed at inducing Honduras to help the Contras as well.   In court Friday, the jury was read a ``Dear Ollie'' note thatBush, then vice president, sent North at Thanksgiving in November1985.   ``One of the many things I have to be thankful for is the way inwhich you have performed under fire in tough situations,'' said thenote, written on the back of a picture. ``Your dedication to thehostage thing and Central America gives me cause for great pride.''   On the witness stand, North testified that to fend off thepossibility of a broader congressional inquiry, he agreed to meetwith the House Intelligence Committee in the White House on August1986.   The 12 felony charges against him include obstructing Congressin saying he didn't give military advice to the Nicaraguan Contrasand didn't raise money for them.   ``Did you tell the truth at that meeting on Aug. 6, 1986?''Sullivan asked.   ``No,'' said North.   ``Do you believe your conduct was unlawful?''   ``No, I didn't think that it was unlawful. ...''   ``I was put in a situation, having been raised to know what theTen Commandments are and knowing it would be wrong to do that, butI went into the meeting not believing it would be illegal not totell Congress the truth. And that's why I didn't think the meetingwould be a good idea.''   Did North tell all that to Adm. John Poindexter, who was thepresident's national security adviser and North's boss?   ``Yes.''   ``And what was his position?''   ``You can take care of it.''   Poindexter, North said, was worried that a $100 million Contraaid package which was about to be approved by Congress would beimperiled if the administration refused to respond to Congress.   ``I told him the heart of the (congressional) resolution ofinquiry was about all kinds of things that couldn't be addressedand he and I both knew what they were,'' North testified, anapparent reference to secret White House efforts to help theContras at a time when Congess had banned official U.S. aid.   ``These things I had done, I was told could not, should not berevealed.''   North said he wanted the Reagan White House to invoke executiveprivilege and refuse to answer any questions but was brushed asideby his boss.   ``You start howling about executive privilege and it's justgoing to make it more difficult for everybody,'' North saidPoindexter told him.   North also testified Friday that he complained that a key lettersent to Capitol Hill by Robert McFarlane, Poindexter's predecessoras national security adviser, was ``totally inconsistent'' with thefacts and ``all this was going to do was add fuel to the fire.''North said, ``The answer he wanted to give was wrong; it was notfactual.''   That letter forms the basis of one of the charges. Although itwas signed by McFarlane, prosecutors charge that North drafted it.   North also contradicted McFarlane by testifying he alteredclassified memos at McFarlane's direction.   The memos showed ``what I had been doing at his direction inCentral America'' for the Contras, ``the delivery of arms, workingwith General Secord and ... building the resistance,'' North toldthe jury.   Richard Secord, a former major general, was enlisted by North torun arms to the Contras.   McFarlane, however, had testified at the trial that North cameto him unsolicited with a few proposed changes, but that McFarlanethrew them away.   North said he had balked at making the changes when McFarlanefirst asked in 1985.   But in November 1986 as the Iran-Contra affair was surfacing,McFarlane, by then out of the NSC but having returned to helpreconstruct an account of the Iran arms initiative, again askedNorth about the memos.   ``I haven't taken care of it yet, but I will,'' North said hetold McFarlane. North's former secretary, Fawn Hall, testifiedearlier that on instructions from North she altered the documentsby deleting numerous references to North's direct involvement withthe Contras.   ``It never occurred to me it was unlawful,'' North said.   On another point, North said there was wide dissemination to topadministration officials of sensitive intelligence about theNorth-arranged delivery of missiles from Israel to Iran at the timeit took place. One of the charges against North is that he prepareda chronology in November 1986 denying that anyone in the governmentknew in 1985 that what was labeled ``oil drilling equipment''actually consisted of missiles.   North, who testified nearly five hours and will return onMonday, also was asked by Sullivan about a $13,800 security fencebuilt around his house and paid for by Secord _ also the basis of acriminal charge.
