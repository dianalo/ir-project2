After spirited debate, delegates at the AMA's policymakingconvention adopted a resolution in support of legislation that wouldaffect large clip, high rate-of-fire automatic and semi-automaticfirearms, and any weapon that is modified or redesigned to operatein that manner.   The proposal is a weaker version of a resolution debated incommittee on Monday calling for a ban on the sale and privateownership of assault weapons, and does not specify the restrictionsbeing sought.   But it still sparked rousing debate as it was presented to thedelegates. The measure ``disarms all of the law-abiding ...tax-paying citizens of the United States ... and leaves us at themercy of the crook, the dope peddler,'' said Dr. F. William Dowda, adelegate from Georgia.   The National Rifle Association contends that such legislationwould unfairly restrict guns commonly used by hunters, and thatcriminals would still have access to the weapons.   But Dr. Louis Zako of the Michigan delegation, which submittedthe original proposal calling for an assault weapon ban, denouncedthat position.   ``A real sportsman who can't bag a deer with a slow-fire rifleought to give up,'' he told the delegates.   The measure was among a host of resolutions referred by variousAMA committees to the 433 delegates. Delegates began voting on themeasures Tuesday, and will conclude Thursday, the final day of theAMA's five-day convention.   Among other action Tuesday, delegates:   _Adopted a resolution calling for model state legislation to banthe sale of alcoholic beverages at gas station convenience stores;   _Adopted a resolution calling for federal legislation to restrictthe advertising and promotion of beer and other alcoholic beverages;   _Deferred action on a measure that would require food labels tolist cholesterol content, caloric value and the specific source ofall vegetable oils. The delegates called for a detailed report onthe measure to be submitted by the 1990 annual meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
