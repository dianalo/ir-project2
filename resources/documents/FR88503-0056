Introduction</ITAG>FDA's authority to enter into cooperative agreements is set out in section301 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241). Cooperative agreementsare authorized under Pub. L. 95-224. FDA's research program is describedin the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance No. 13.103. Before enteringinto cooperative agreements, FDA carefully considers the benefits suchagreements will have to the public. As discussed below the agency believesthat a cooperative agreement to establish a national center for food safetywill benefit the public by providing an opportunity for improving existingscientific knowledge in the food safety area.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>In the United States there is no single center for research and developmentof expertise and analytical methodology in food safety. A recent comprehensivereview by FDA of its food science research program concluded that a morediversified program is necessary to provide the indepth knowledge neededto review effectively the products of new technology and protect the publichealth (Food Science Research Program Report, CFSAN, Office of PhysicalSciences, December 1987). FDA believes that current agency support in thearea of food science should:Encourage development of expertise to understand emerging technologiesin general and biotechnology in particular and to evaluate the effectsof new technologies on food components and on the adequacy of processingvariables;Encourage scientific interchange between industry, academia, and governmentconcerning the impact of recent technological developments on the compositionof foods, particularly on constituents of public health significance; andEncourage the development of expertise throughout the food safety sciencecommunity.Expertise in evaluating food processing must be developed consistent withindustry advances in modernizing food processing methods. There is a clearneed for collaborative work and research on processing systems to determinecritical control points that require monitoring to enhance quality assuranceefforts and promote efficient and effective regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. National Center for Food Safety</ITAG>A. ConceptThe agency believes that a collaborative effort between FDA and the privatesector (i.e., academia and a nonprofit research organization) could bedesigned to:Develop scientific expertise necessary to address ongoing key public healthissues and to provide early warning of emerging problems, and also to providesupport during periodic emergencies and crisis situations (e.g., <T3>Listeria</T3>, PCB's, aldicarb, vomitoxin); andEstablish mechanisms for exchange of technical information and scientificconcepts between FDA and other sectors of the food science community (e.g.,industry and academia).This collaboration would result in a national center for food safety. Thecenter would concentrate on developing the scientific expertise necessaryto deal with current and emerging public health issues and on establishingmechanisms for the exchange of information with industry and the public.The center could improve existing expertise concerning the physical andchemical analysis of foods and food products. The center could increaseunderstanding about deviations in the ``normal'' composition of foods,such as the presence of contaminants, filth, or process-induced chemicalchanges. Moreover, existing scientific expertise in food engineering couldalso be increased concerning how fluid mechanics, transfer and rate processes,and process control instrumentation may affect food processing, packaging,and storage. Similarly, existing expertise could be improved concerningthe relationship between processing, packaging, and storage factors andthe chemical composition and microbial characteristics of foods.Such a center would focus on recent developments in the science of foodformulation, processing, and packaging, including the study of macrocomponentsof foods (carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids); new food processes (e.g.,dehydration, fermentation, thermal) and packaging systems, with a particularemphasis on plastics. The science of microcomponents of foods_those naturallyoccurring, added, or altered during formulation, processing or storage_thatare of public health significance would also be an important aspect ofsuch study.Such a collaborative center should be designed to provide the environmentand expertise necessary to conduct advanced research in key areas, includingextrusion processing, aseptic processing, packaging integrity, irradiationprocessing, and biotechnology.In summary, expertise in food science is basic to progress and the continuedsafety of the U.S. food supply. Keeping pace with expanding knowledge isessential to the timely development and evaluation of processing techniques,product-specific processes, new packaging materials and new uses for thesematerials, and use of biotechnology.B. Research FacilitiesTo pursue the type of collaborative research discussed, certain specializedfacilities are needed. A pilot plant, built to modern specifications andequipped with the many physical requirements necessary to conduct routinefood processing research in a commercial atmosphere would be essential.The physical layout of the plant would have to provide maximum versatilityin the use and arrangement of equipment of both commercial and pilot size,and in the capability to simultaneously operate several different piecesof equipment without interference with each other. In addition to facilitiesto conduct routine processing research, there would have to be facilitiessuitable for more complex research. Also, a clean room, equipped with laminarair flow and HEPA filters and easily sterilized, would be needed for workinvolving opportunistic pathogens.The availability of containment facilities, in which experimental workcould be housed in its entirety, would also be required to provide theopportunity to conduct essential research that is potentially hazardous.For example, research to determine the adequacy of processing parametersused in commercial food production requires the use of pathogenic bacteriaas well as large quantities of the food being processed. If this type ofresearch is not conducted in a controlled manner in a containment facility,a risk exists that the pathogen could contaminate the environment. Similarily,containment facilities would be essential for research in some criticalareas of biotechnology. Such facilities would be used for example to understandthe production of flavors and food additives in scaled up fermentationprocesses which rely on genes cloned into microorganisms.Another critical attribute of a research facility would be the abilityto conduct proprietary research. Through this proprietary research collaboratorswill have access to state-of-the-art food processing and packaging equipment.Examples of the types of sophisticated equipment are: Aseptic processingand packaging equipment for both homogeneous foods and foods containingparticulate matter; extrusion equipment for fiber fraction and processingparameter studies; and reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration equipment forconcentration studies. In addition, the traditional types of processingequipment, for example, plate heat exchangers and retorts, would be needed.Through the collaboration offered by a national center, each contributorwould have access to the equipment described above, and would have theopportunity to gain valuable insight and practical knowledge about moderndevelopments within the food industry. It is envisioned that these goalswould be accomplished in a nonprofit, research-oriented atmosphere condusiveto the transfer of science and technology. It is also envisioned that agreementsunder the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA) may ensue fromthis collaboration.C. SummaryThe public and FDA would both benefit from the type of collaboration possiblethrough a national center for food safety. Scientists from each sectorwould bring a special perspective to advancing the knowledge of food safetyscience. Interaction among such scientists would stimulate creativity andinnovation. FDA's presence in such a venture will promote a greater awarenessand understanding of regulatory procedures among academic and industryscientists, thereby providing economic and program benefits to all sectors.In summary, collaboration between the public and the private sector wouldbe an efficient means of remaining current with scientific and technicalaccomplishments from a food safety perspective. FDA believes that a nationalcenter for food safety would be a sound investment in the future publichealth of American consumers. It would provide an opportunity for extensivecooperation with university scientists; and it would stimulate the ideaof technology transfer, which might ultimately contribute significantlyto implementation of the goals of the FTTA.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Proposal</ITAG>FDA is considering entering into a cooperative agreement with IIT and,through IIT, with its nonprofit research affiliate, IITRI. The agency believesthat this institution has the research capability, the required researchfacilities, and the academic interest to develop a comprehensive programin food safety. For these reasons, FDA proposes to enter into this cooperativeagreement with less than maximum competition. However, the agency invitesapplications from other interested parties who can provide all the elementsdescribed in item III. above. The amount of funding to be provided by FDAis $700,000 with possible additional increments.FDA has discussed this program with IIT and will be available to discussthe program concepts with any other qualified applicants. However, becauseit is important to keep this project research oriented and beyond any appearanceof conflict of interest, FDA will not consider applications from any FDA-regulatedindustry.In conjunction with, but not part of, this cooperative agreement, FDA mayalso occupy laboratory and office space at the facility of the recipient.This space may eventually accommodate approximately 40 scientific and administrativepersonnel. In addition, FDA anticipates entering into separate contractualagreements to perform adjunct segments of work important to the developmentof a well-rounded national food safety program concept.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Reporting Requirements</ITAG>Program progess reports and financial status reports will be required quarterly,based on date of award. These reports will be due within 30 days afterthe last day of each quarter. A final program progress report and financialstatus report will be due 90 days after expiration of the budget periodof the cooperative agreement.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Mechanism of Support</ITAG>A. Award InstrumentSupport for this program will be in the form of a cooperative agreement.The award will be subject to all policies and requirements that governthe research grant programs of the Public Health Service (PHS), includingthe provisions of 42 CFR Part 52, 45 CFR Part 74, and the PHS grants policystatement.B. EligibilityThe cooperative agreement is available to any public or private nonprofitorganization, State and local units of government, and for profit organizations(excluding fees or profit). Any FDA-regulated industry will not be eligiblefor consideration.C. Length of SupportThe length of support is anticipated to be 1 year, with the possibilityof an additional 2 years. Noncompetitive continuation of support, beyondthe first year, will be based upon review of performance during the precedingyear and the availability of Federal fiscal year appropriations.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
