This dynamics determines peripheral plasma parameterstill the time when it begins to affect neck development dynamics. Thediscussion is performed proceeding from obtained during this work analyticalsolutions of corresponding equations of magnetic hydrodynamics. Situationwhen finiteness of the peripheral plasma inertia pays an important role,e.g.during 'current break' in pinch plasma and problem of regular accelerationof peripheral plasma ions have been considered. 18 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
