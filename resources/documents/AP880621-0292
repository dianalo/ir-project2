The discussions are very intense,''a senior Canadian official said as negotiators searched late intothe night for a compromise between what he termed ``extremepositions.''   ``There may be the possibility of movement, and there may not,''the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Negotiators for the seven industrialized democracies and theEuropean Community sought a formula to accommodate conflictingstances in advance of crucial General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) talks in December in Montreal.   The declaration on farm subsidies, which ranked with Third Worlddebt as a major economic issue at the three-day gathering, wasexpected to be included in the final communique that will bereleased Tuesday afternoon.   West German sources said the communique would contain noreference to the United States plan for the elimnation of allsubsidies by the year 2000.   A Canadian official said the officials faced ``a long night''working on the farm subsidy draft after the Europeans stuck totheir position that the subsidies must be curtailed, but cannot beeliminated.   ``It is totally unrealistic,'' British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson said of the U.S. plan.   ``I think that it scares farmers in most parts of the worldunnecessarily if you do talk in terms of abolishing all governmentsupport, all subsidies, by the year 2000,'' Lawson added in atelevision interview.   ``On the other hand, we have got to have some form ofmultilateral disarmament on this issue.''   British officials said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, duringan hour-long closed session on the subsidy issue, urged the UnitedStates and Canada to give the 12-nation European Economic Communitycredit for its moves since 1984 to cut subsidies.   At a special meeting last spring, the EEC instituted a system ofautomatic subsidy cutoffs if farmers exceeded their productionquotas.   But the West European agriculture remains heavily subsidized.The farm program consumes two-thirds of the EEC's budget.   EEC President Jacques Delors urged the leaders during Monday'ssession to implement past pledges to curtail subsidies rather thanendorse the U.S. plan.   ``There is a limit to what you can ask farmers to do,'' Delors'spokeswoman, Francoise Le Bail, said Monday evening.   According to figures produced by the 24-nation Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development, Japan provided a 75 percentsubsidy for its agriculture in 1986, compared with 54 percent in1980. European Economic Community subsidies totaled 49 percent in1986, up from from 36 percent in 1980. U.S. subsidies were 35percent in 1986, up from 15 percent in 1980.   Britain, France, Italy and West Germany, the four Europeannations taking part in the summit, are all members of the EEC.</TEXT></DOC>
