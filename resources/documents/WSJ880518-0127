All were built with the help of federal Urban Development Action Grants. Advertised as a way of steering federal dollars to distressed urban areas, UDAGs are actually a lush picnic basket for private developers.    For seven years the Reagan administration has tried to end the UDAG program. Former budget director David Stockman called it &quot;the most ideologically offensive and wasteful bit of federal spending on the block.&quot; But members of Congress have balked at killing a program that lets them hand out federal dollars for highly visible local projects. Under pressure, they did restrict UDAGs to areas of &quot;economic distress&quot; and to projects that would not otherwise be built. Now there are signs even those modest restraints are being cast aside.    The city of Des Moines, Iowa, has applied for a $4 million UDAG to help develop a giant 840,000-square-foot shopping mall even though the city already has twice the mall space of any comparable Midwest city. Nonetheless, officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which administers UDAGs, say the mall grant stands a good chance of being awarded later this month.    Jon Batesole, the mall's developer, has admitted the $60 million project will be built with or without the grant. He says the federal money is needed to build a &quot;much nicer project&quot; with landscaping and eye-catching design features. Des Moines says the UDAG is needed so the mall can go forward &quot;as proposed.&quot;    Des Moines normally would never qualify for a UDAG because as a relatively well-off area it flunks the &quot;economic distress&quot; test. But last fall, Iowa's Sen. Charles Grassley (who used to berate the Pentagon for waste, fraud and abuse) helped pass an amendment allowing 35% of UDAGs to be awarded without regard to economic distress. Des Moines filed its application the same month. Under the new formula, Des Moines still has to show that the project will produce a substantial number of new jobs, and the city claims the mall will mean 1,200 new sales jobs. Not so, says Prof. Kenneth Stone of Iowa State, a leading expert on retail sales, who claims it will simply shift jobs from one area to another. His projections show that the new mall will create only four new jobs at a cost of $4 million in taxpayers' money.    Since UDAGs are prohibited from going to projects &quot;likely to facilitate&quot; such job relocations, towns around Des Moines have challenged the use of federal subsidies to divert business from one area to another. UDAG staffers say that if they enforced this ban literally, the entire program would be threatened because so many projects involve job piracy.    The Reagan administration has whittled UDAG funding from $675 million a year in 1981 to $216 million in 1988, but support for the old status quo is building on Capitol Hill. Jeffrey A. Finkle of the National Council for Urban Economic Development says the new formula allowing UDAGs to go to non-needy areas has soldified congressional support for the program.    Congress won't kill UDAGs; that brave act would offend the politically influential developers the program nourishes. Under the current budget system this single appropriations item will exist into eternity, siphoning money out from the Treasury. It will do so until a more rational system permits the president to pick up his pencil and draw a line through it. </TEXT></DOC>
