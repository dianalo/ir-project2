ROTSTEIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TUBA CITY, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Navajo tribal judge Wednesday began,then recessed, a hearing on temporary custody of an Indian infantcaught in a tug of war between the tribe and a non-Indian couplewho want to adopt her.   It was not immediately known why Judge Manuel Watchman of NavajoTribal Children's Court recessed until Friday the two-hour closedhearing over 9-month-old Allyssa Keetso.   However, Robert Walters, a lawyer appointed by the tribe as anadvocate for the child, came out an hour into the hearing and saidhe had been disqualified and was under a gag order. ``The baby hasno representation,'' he said.   Walters said he was ordered off the case after seeking dismissalof the tribal action that had brought the custody issue before theChildrens' Court.   Allyssa was born to an Indian who wants the child to be adoptedby Rick and Cheryl Pitts of San Jose, Calif., but the tribeasserted its rights under federal law to decide adoptions of Indianchildren, and a California judge last week ordered the baby turnedover to the tribe pending a final custody decision.   Meanwhile, the child has been in the Pittses' care at thereservation since Sunday. The couple was ordered to remain thereuntil Friday's hearing.   Anslem Roanhorse, a Navajo official with the tribe's Division ofSocial Welfare, said, however, that the agency retained legalcustody of Allyssa.   Watchman was expected during Wednesday's hearing to begindeciding whether the baby should be adopted by the Pittses, withwhom she has lived since birth, or live on the reservation, perhapswith her mother's parents.   The hearing, which was closed because it is a juvenileproceeding, was expected to address temporary custody, with ahearing to be held later on a permanent arrangement.   Patricia Keetso, 21, was unmarried, pregnant and unable tosupport the child when the Pittses contacted her through anewspaper advertisement. She said she gave them Allyssa to affordthe child a better life.   The Pittses, both 33, were in the process of adopting Allyssa,with Ms. Keetso's approval, when the Navajo Tribal Courtsintervened.   Barry A. Goodfield, a psychologist advising the Pittses, accusedtribal officials of being more worried about paperwork than thewell-being of the child.   ``There's a power game being played in there, and a baby isbeing used as a football,'' Goodfield said.   Sam Pitts, Rick Pitts' father, said before the hearing, ``We'rejust hoping and praying that this hearing today will give ustemporary custody while we continue to fight for adoption in tribalcourts.''   He held the baby before the hearing and said, ``She's justfrightened and just not her happy, jolly self.''   In a similar case last year, a tribal judge in Window Rockawarded temporary custody of a 10-year-old Navajo boy to anon-Indian couple who sought to adopt him, pending a custody trial.   Federal law gives tribal courts jurisdiction to decide adoptionsof Indian children in certain instances. Navajo law places strongemphasis on extended family.</TEXT></DOC>
