Kyodo, in a report Sunday from the Burmese capital of Rangoon,said the groups also demanded compensation for families of thosekilled in massive anti-government riots last week.   Diplomats contacted in Rangoon said they saw leaflets callingfor more demonstrations but they could not confirm that theprotests were called specifically for Monday.   On Friday, Sein Lwin resigned as president and head of Burma'sonly party after four days of street riots that by official countkilled at least 95 people. Unconfirmed reports say hundreds ofpeople were killed.   No new party leader or president has been named.   The state-owned Radio Rangoon said security forces Sundayentered the suburb of North Okkalapa, a site of fierce fightingbetween troops and anti-government protesters last week.   The radio said the forces entered to ``maintain law and order''at the request of Buddhist monks and residents. But the broadcastadded that barricades were removed, bus services resumed and thearmy donated 25 tons of rice to residents.   Diplomats and returning tourists said downtown Rangoon was calmover the weekend.   ``There's definitely an appearance of returning to normality,''one Western diplomat said. ``The real test will be how many peoplecome back to their offices Monday.''   The broadcast said markets opened and buses resumed operationSunday in Mandalay, Burma's second largest city and another sceneof massive protests.   Sein Lwin, called ``Burma's Hitler'' by one demonstrator, waswidely hated for brutally crushing dissent during his 17 days inpower and during 26 years of authoritarian rule by his predecessor,Ne Win.   Sein Lwin last month replaced Ne Win as chairman of thecountry's single political party, the Burma Socialist ProgramParty. Ne Win had ruled since leading a 1962 military coup thatended Burmese democracy.   On July 30, authorities arrested the government's leadingcritic, Gen. Aung Gyi, along with others accused of ``anti-stateactivities.'' Also arrested was Sein Win, the Burmese correspondentof The Associated Press.   In a document circulated to diplomats last week, protesters alsodemanded a referendum on a multi-party political system, an end tomartial law, freedom for dissidents and student protesters andreductions in the cost of living.   It was not known how much support the students would receivefrom other groups for another round of demonstrations. Stateworkers, Buddhist monks and teen-agers were among the tens ofthousands who rallied in 25 cities.   The government has attempted to use the powerful Buddhist clergyto call for peace. Radio Rangoon said authorities Sunday met withIslamic leaders who issued ``a request to the faithful for peaceand tranquillity and rule of law.'' Moslems make up less than 5percent of the population.   In Sunday's Bangkok Post, two travelers who just arrived fromRangoon wrote that Sein Lwin's resignation reinforced theprotesters' determination to press for elimination of the BurmaSocialist Program Party.   ``We have cut one head off a many-headed serpent,'' they quotedone protester as saying. ``The others remain. They all have to go.''   In another article Sunday, the newspaper quoted Thai PrimeMinister Chatichai Choonhavan as denying rumors that Sein Lwinsought refuge in Thailand.   The rumors began Friday after a man described as Burma'sindustry minister left Rangoon for a flight to Bangkok, New Delhiand London.   Officials contacted by The Associated Press in Thailand, Indiaand Great Britain said they had no information on Sein Lwin seekingrefuge there.   Burmese have been angered by the country's mounting economicproblems, including rampant inflation and food shortages.   Under Ne Win's isolationist policies, one of Southeast Asia'swealthiest nations became one of its poorest, with an annual percapita income of less than $200.   In neighboring Bangladesh, at least 500 students marched throughthe capital of Dhaka Saturday to support the Burmese riots anddemand Burma release the AP correspondent, Sein Win, and otherpolitical prisoners.   Members of the Central Students' Action Committee asked theBurmese Embassy for a government investigation into acts ofrepression in Burma.</TEXT></DOC>
