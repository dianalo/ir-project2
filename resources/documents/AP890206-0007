Bush: Well, for more than half a century the U.S. has operated adeposit insurance program that provides direct government protectionto the savings of our citizens.   This program has enabled tens of millions of Americans to savewith confidence.   In all the time since creation of the deposit insurance, savershave not lost one dollar of insured deposits, and I am determinedthat they never will.   Deposit insurance has always been intended to be self-funded.   And this means that the banks, the savings and loans, and creditunions that are insured pay a small amount of their assets each yearinto a fund that's used to protect depositors.   In every case these funds are spent to protect the depositors,not the institutions that fail.   For the last 20 years, conditions in our financial markets havegrown steadily more complex, and a portion of the savings and loanindustry has encountered steadily growing problems.   These financial difficulties have led to a continuous erosion ofthe strength of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation,FSLIC.   Economic conditions have played a major role in this situation.   However, unconscionable risk-taking, fraud, and outrightcriminality have also been factors.   Because of the accumulation of loses at hundreds of these thriftinstitutions, additional resources must be devoted to cleaning upthis problem.   We intend to restore our entire deposit insurance system tocomplete health.   While the issues are complex and the difficulties manifold, wewill make the hard choices, not run from them.   We will see that the guarantee to depositors is forever honored,and we will see to it that the system is reformed comprehensively sothat the situation is not repeated again.   To do this, I am today announcing a comprehensive andwide-ranging set of proposals.   The secretary of the treasury, Nicholas Brady, will describethese proposals to you in detail in a few minutes.   However, I think it's important to summarize some of the majorpoints.   The proposals include four major elements.   First, currently insolvent savings institutions will be placedunder the joint management of the FDIC and FSLIC, pursuant toexisting law.   This will enable us to control future risk-taking and to beginreducing ongoing losses.   Second, the regulatory mechanism will be substantially overhauledto enable it to more effectively limit risk-taking.   The FDIC would become the insurance agency for both banks andthrifts under this system, although there's no comingling of funds.   The insurer will have the authority to set minimum standards forcapital and accounting.   Uniform disclosure standards will also be implemented.   The chartering agency for thrifts would come under the generaloversight of the secretary of the treasury.   Third, we will create a financing corporation to issue $50billion in bonds to finance the cost of resolving failedinstitutions which will supplement approximately $40 billion thathas already been spent.   All of the principal of these bonds and a portion of the intereston them will be paid from industry sources.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
