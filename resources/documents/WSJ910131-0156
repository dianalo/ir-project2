Democratic leaders were quick to predict the defeat of theproposal, which the president revived in his State of theUnion speech Tuesday. And they weren't alone. Advocates ofthe cut from both parties doubt it will succeed.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It is a very difficult, uphill fight,&quot; said Rep. GuyVander Jagt (R., Mich.), a senior member of the House Waysand Means Committee. Sen. Bob Graham (D., Fla.), who is alsoa strong supporter of a capital gains cut, agreed: &quot;It's nota very high probability.&quot;   The Democratic leaders remain united in their oppositionto the tax change and are confident they again will beat it.Asked if Congress would approve a capital gains cut, HouseSpeaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said, &quot;In a single word,`No.'&quot;   At the same time, though, the president has clearlyrestarted the capital gains debate and added a new element.In his address, he called for the creation of a commission,headed by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, tostudy capital gains. Rep. Vander Jagt, for one, called thatmove &quot;a ray of hope -- long term.&quot;   But Rep. Ed Jenkins of Georgia, a major Democratic backerof the tax cut, interpreted the call for a study as a way toshelve the issue. &quot;Since they've asked for a study, itappears to me that takes it off the front burner.&quot;   Likewise, House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta(D., Calif.), who opposes the proposal, said, &quot;It's goinginto the deep, dark caverns of a commission.&quot;   Democrats also mocked the selection of Mr. Greenspan tohead the commission. As a GOP appointee with a long historyof support for a capital gains cut, he is hardly an impartialarbiter, they said.   Capital gains are the profits from the sale of assets,such as real estate and stocks. They are currently taxed asordinary income. A tax cut would initially boost sales, asinvestors rushed to benefit, so tax revenue would increase inthe short run. But over time, most studies show, the tax cutwould cost the government billions of dollars.   The question of the proposal's cost is a pivotal one. Anyrevenue-losing plan will have a particularly hard road thisyear, given increasing deficits and the soaring cost of theMideast war.   Any debate is likely to cover well-worn ground.Republicans praise the tax cut's economic benefits, whileDemocrats complain that it is a giveaway to the wealthy. Butthe old arguments are being updated for current events.Supporters say the tax cut is needed to stimulate an economyin recession. Detractors argue that the rich will benefitwhile the children of lower-income families are fighting inthe war.   Even parts of the business community are unsympathetic tothe president's proposal. Some corporate leaders fear thatany cut in capital gains taxes would be paired with increasesin other taxes, reduced tax breaks, or both.   &quot;If the president decides to push it,&quot; Mr. Panetta said,&quot;then clearly Democrats are prepared to respond in kind.&quot;   Certainly the response would include a surtax onmillionaires, which Democrats proposed last year. Also underrenewed discussion is a reduced Social Security payroll taxfor lower-income and middle-income taxpayers, though manyDemocrats oppose the idea because it would inflate thedeficit.   But with the nation at war, and Mr. Bush's popularity withthe voters high, Democratic leaders aren't anxious to takehim on -- especially if he doesn't intend to make a big pushfor the tax cut. Democratic leaders were silent about any newtaxes on upper-income people.</TEXT></DOC>
