As previously reported, last month five banks announced they were combining their teller machines in a sprawling six-state network in New England. BayBanks, whose chief competitive advantage until now has been its ownership of the biggest individual teller-machine network in Massachusetts, declined to join.    &quot;Their proposal to us was like an invitation to a potluck supper,&quot; said William T. Sandalls Jr., vice chairman of BayBanks. &quot;They volunteered to bring the spinach, but they wanted us to bring the steak.&quot;    BayBanks filed the suit against Connecticut Switch Inc., the operator of the network, called Yankee 24. The suit also named Bank of Boston, Bank of New England, Shawmut Bank, State Street Bank andamp; Trust Co. and Fleet National Bank as co-conspirators. Together, these banks are forming a teller-machine network that by mid-1987 will have a network of about 1,300 machines in New England. BayBanks said its New England network has 1,250 machines.    BayBanks charged specifically that Yankee 24 was assessing fees in such a way as to discourage Yankee 24's smaller member banks from participating in other networks. Bank of Boston, which spearheaded the cooperative effort among the rival banks, declined comment until it had time to study the suit. </TEXT></DOC>
