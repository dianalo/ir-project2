Mr. Smith said sales rose 11% to about $22 million. He also predicted that the maker of vinyl siding and other home building products will boost sales and profit for all of 1987 10% to 15% from the 1986 level.    &quot;We now are benefiting from being in the right product,&quot; Mr. Smith said. Sales of vinyl products, which account for 75% of the company's total sales, are growing at 35% to 40% a year, he said. The marketing of aluminum building products, which the company no longer manufactures itself, account for the remainder. The company began switching to vinyl manufacturing from aluminum manufacturing in 1978.    &quot;By 1990 we'll be 90% into vinyl,&quot; Mr. Smith said in an interview.    In the fourth quarter of 1985, Wolverine earned $969,000, or 31 cents a share, on sales of $19.9 million. For all of 1985 the company earned $2.9 million, or 89 cents a share, on sales of $84.8 million.    Adding the expected fourth-quarter profit to that of the first three quarters of 1986 should result in annual profit of about $4.2 million, or $1.24 a share, on sales of $99.5 million. The company expects to announce its fourth-quarter and year results next week. </TEXT></DOC>
