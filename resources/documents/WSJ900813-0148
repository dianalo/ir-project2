This time around, however, bullion proved to be anunsatisfactory haven for Middle Eastern potentates, somedealers say.</LP><TEXT>   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait only spurred a gold price riseof $23 to $396 an ounce, and the metal proved to be poorsecurity for Kuwaitis, the dealers say. The invading Iraqiarmy looted Kuwaiti banks, houses and bazaars, stealing largequantities of gold.   &quot;Worried Middle Eastern potentates now appreciate thatgold doesn't provide more security than other financialassets,&quot; a German bullion manager says. On the contrary, itwas fortunate for wealthy Kuwaitis to have other assetssafely tucked away in foreign banks, he says.   It isn't even advantageous to hold gold as a &quot;discreetasset&quot;, the dealers say. Gold isn't any more anonymous thancurrency deposits, securities or any other financial assets,they say.   When the U.S., U.K. and other nations either froze orrestricted movement of Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets after theinvasion, gold was included.   Gold owned by Kuwaitis and Iraqis are under the samerestrictions as other assets, a senior Bank of Englandofficial says. Banks intending buying or selling bullion onbehalf of Kuwaiti or Iraqi owners must receive permissionfrom the Bank of England, the official says.   Bullion banks are under a legal obligation to disclosewhether Kuwaitis or Iraqis are the owners of the metal, theofficial said. Since gold stocks are held at the Bank ofEngland and in the vaults of London bullion houses, itsownership can be traced, the official says.   The Bank of England rules apply to assets under its ownjurisdiction, the official says. Yet if a Swiss bank carriesout the transaction with a London bullion house, it is up tothe Swiss intermediary to disclose the Kuwaiti or Iraqiownership of the gold to its own regulatory authority, theofficial says.   Yet some dealers say wealthy Middle Eastern investors areno longer mesmerized by gold.   It costs $1500 for each $1 million worth of gold stored ina vault of a Swiss bank, and the metal doesn't earn anyinterest.   &quot;Moreover, the younger Middle Eastern generation isn't asgold-minded as their elders,&quot; says Alfred Schneider, a firstvice president of Swiss Bank Corp. They are educated abroadand understand sophisticated currency and bond and equityinvestments, he says.   Between March and June, Kuwaiti and Saudi investors dumpedan estimated 100 to 200 tons of gold on the market, bulliondealers say, because they were disenchanted with it as aninvestment. That gold was originally bought in the late '70s,so losses on capital and foregone interest were extensive.   In their rush to obtain dollars and other foreign currencyduring the latest crisis, wealthy Middle Eastern sheiks,including Kuwaitis and Saudi Arabians, sold more gold, Swissdealers say. They received higher prices because professionaldealers and investors in Europe, the U.S. and Japan wereenthusiastic buyers.   Despite the growing sophistication of the wealthier MiddleEast families, people in the region will continue to behoarders of gold, according to Timothy Green, a goldconsultant and author of books on the subject. In the pastdecade, for example, Saudi Arabians bought 173 tons of goldfrom local dealers.   In the latest crisis, Middle Eastern investors boughtsmall gold bars and jewelry at bazaars known as souks. Thesouks could soon run out of gold, dealers say, because Swissand other Western bullion refiners have stopped shipments ofthe metal to the unstable region.   There were some advantages for Kuwaitis to hold gold.   &quot;An ounce or two would have bribed an Iraqi soldier,&quot; theGerman banker says. For refugees, gold in the pocket is worthfar more than virtually useless Kuwaiti currency, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
