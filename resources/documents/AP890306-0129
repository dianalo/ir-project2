Meanwhile, the chairman of a House aviation subcommitteescheduled a hearing for Tuesday and said he hoped for quick actionon separate legislation to force Bush to appoint an emergency boardand end the strike for 60 days.   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., suggested his legislation ``mightgive cover to the administration'' for the emergency action Bushrefused to take on Friday before the strike began.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that as longas Eastern's striking members of the Machinists union refrain frompicketing other airlines or railways, ``we wouldn't find itnecessary to send up the legislation'' barring such secondary action.   But Fitzwater said the administration is prepared ``to moverapidly to submit the legislation if the secondary boycott occurs.''   The million-member International Association of Machinists andAerospace Workers has said it would picket other airlines andrailways but called off the secondary actions, at least temporarily,after a New York court ruled that other workers mustn't honor suchpicket lines. The union is appealing.   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said he and Bush werepleased that the strike by Eastern's Machinists had not spread.   ``We're encouraged by the fact that no secondary picketing hasoccurred,'' Skinner said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``That's an actof responsibility by the unions, and the president and I are veryappreciative.''   Skinner met with Bush in the White House Sunday night, Fitzwatersaid.   Asked if the president had second thoughts about refusing toinvoke the Railway Labor Act to stop the strike, the spokesman said:``We have no indication of any change.''   Fitzwater said Bush was receiving ``daily briefings'' on thesituation and still believes the dispute can best be resolved by thecompany and the union in negotiations rather than through governmentintervention.   In Congress, the aviation subcommittee of the House Public WorksCommittee announced a hearing Tuesday on Bush's decision againstintervening before 8,500 Machinists union members walked off the jobat Eastern. Most pilots and flight attendants refused to cross thepicket lines, and Eastern was reduced to a relatively few flightsduring the weekend.   Bush on Friday rejected the recommendation of federal mediatorsand 33 senators to appoint an emergency board, which would havedelayed a strike for at least 60 days.   Union president William Winpisinger, on ABC-TV's ``Good MorningAmerica,'' said it was ``incomprehensible to me'' that Bush did notstep in and stop the strike.   Winpisinger said Bush's action supported Frank Lorenzo, head ofEastern's parent company, Texas Air Corp., whom the union accuses ofwanting to shut down and sell off money-losing Eastern.   The union president said the administration threat to go toCongress in an effort to end secondary picketing rights ``isabsolutely pro-Lorenzo, pro-company and pro-management, and it's acontinuation of the Reagan administration attitude. That's unionbusting.''   At a Capitol Hill news conference, Rep. Oberstar said Tuesday'shearing would look into both sides in the strike, and he promisedquick action on his bill to force a resolution by a presidentiallyappointed mediation board.   Oberstar did not contend that the strike has reached``emergency'' proportions. But he called it part of ``a long-termproblem with broad implications for the airline industry. If not anemergency, this is a matter of great public interest.''   Skinner and AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland are to appear at thehearing.</TEXT></DOC>
