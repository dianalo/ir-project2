(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>If you've got an HP Laserjet or compatible printer, you're probably on thelookout for more fonts.andP;  MoreFonts creates soft fonts for use with wordprocessing or DTP programs, but this program isn't a standard font generatorlike Bitstream Fontware: its value lies in its ability to create specialeffect fonts.andM;Like all font generators for Laserjet and compatible printers, you'll need afair amount of disk space to store the outlines; usefully, MoreFonts canstore created font definitions in just a few hundred bytes, which don'ttranslate into large amounts of occupied disk space until you actually createthe soft font files.andM;The manual looks fairly unprepossessing, but in fact it tackles program setupand font installation (I used it with Ventura Publisher) well.andP;  There arealso installation routines for programs including PageMaker, WordPerfect 5.andO;1, Microsoft Word, Windows, Excel and Ami.andM;You get 14 fonts with the program: Times and Helvetica lookalikes, plus someother fancier typefaces.andP;  Other faces can be added and are listed at the backof the manual.andP;  However, the number of typefaces available is missing thepoint: MoreFonts is about creating special effects, not generating fonts.andM;You choose patterns or shades for the characters themselves, plusbackgrounds, shadows and outlines.andP;  The special effects for these range fromplain black or white to London Fog, rattan and fountain.andP;  it's hard to givean indication of what you can do, because there are so many possiblecombinations that you could put together; however, these special effectsgenerally look better in larger point sizes.andM;Installation was easy and the program supports a mouse; you configureMoreFonts for your particular application and then start creating fonts.andP;  Anice feature is the ability, by pressing F9, to preview on-screen the fontyou're creating; there's also the option to print it out before committingdisk space to save it.andP;  The print out provides full details of the optionschosen, plus the alphabet and some sample text in the proposed font.andP;  Youname the font when you're satisfied with it, then install it for yourapplication.andM;A particularly useful option for conserving disk space is the ability tospecify a limited set of characters for a particular font: you might want,for example, to create the words For Sale in a certain style.andP;  MoreFontsallows you to type in the required characters and save as a new font.andP;  Thereare also masses of character sets.andM;MoreFonts was trouble-free and is one of the easiest font generators I'veused.andP;  If you want to create one-off special effect fonts, this is anattractive and reasonably priced package.andM;USER VERDICTandM;* PRODUCT MoreFontsandM;* SUPPLIED BY Power Up Software, Unit 9, ComptonandM;Place, Surrey Avenue, Camberley, Surrey GU15 3DX.andM;Tel: (0276) 65272andM;* DESCRIPTION Special effects font generator.andM;* PRICE [British pounds] 74.95andM;* K USER VERDICT Easy-to-use program that can provideandM;a really wide variety of special effect fonts.andM;*  GOOD</TEXT></DOC>
