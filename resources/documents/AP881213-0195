GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vietnam will start withdrawing18,000 troops from Cambodia on Thursday in a weeklong transfer alongfour land routes and down the Mekong River, army spokesman Lt. Gen.Nguyen Van Thai announced.   He told a news conference on Tuesday that the seventh partialpullout will leave 50,000 Vietnamese troops fighting three Cambodianguerrilla groups _ the communist Khmer Rouge and two non-communistgroups.   Communist Vietnam's withdrawal, promised for completion by theend of 1990, has raised fears that the Khmer Rouge will become thedominant military force in the country and institute a second reignof terror.   But Thai told reporters the pro-Hanoi Cambodian army along withthe remaining Vietnamese troops can ``take care of themselves.''   Thai said the largest single withdrawing element consists of6,000 troops and 300 vehicles that will begin a five-day trek acrossthe length of the country Thursday from Battambang and Sisophon innorthwestern Cambodia to Vietnam's Tay Ninh province in the east.   One infantry division and an engineer regiment will leave PhnomPenh, the Cambodian capital, by boat down the Mekong River, whichflows into southern Vietnam, he said.   Vietnam says it has withdrawn 32,000 troops so far this year andwith this week's 18,000 it will have pulled out the 50,000 itpromised to send home in 1988. Some Western diplomatic sources inBangkok said recently that only 15,000 to 20,000 were withdrawn sofar this year.   But Western analysts, after describing earlier announced pulloutsas ``mere troop rotations,'' say Hanoi appears serious about leavingmost of the fighting to the Phnom Penh government and husbanding itsstretched resources for domestic economic development.   The analysts and sources spoke on condition of anonymity.   Hanoi's military presence in Cambodia has seriously fractured itsties to the Western world, China, Japan and other countries. TheUnited States has said it will not establish diplomatic ties untilafter a total pullout.   But concern also has arisen that the Khmer Rouge, estimated atbetween 30,000 and 40,000, will prove stronger than either the PhnomPenh army or its own Cambodian allies and make another grab forpower.   Before being toppled by Vietnam's invasion force in early 1979,the Khmer Rouge forced Cambodia into a brutal, regimented society.Hundreds of thousands died in forced labor communes and mass``killing fields.''   Western diplomatic sources estimate the Phnom Penh army'sstrength at 44,000 regular soldiers, and the combined strength ofthe non-communist factions uneasily allied with the Khmer Rouge isabout 27,000.   Thai said some units returning to Vietnam will be demobilized aspart of a major reduction of the country's massive military strengthover the next few years. The reduction would involve more than300,000 personnel, Thai said.   With more than a million regular soldiers under arms, Vietnamfields the world's fifth largest armed force after the Soviet Union,China, the United States and India.</TEXT></DOC>
