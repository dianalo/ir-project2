<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-82-0367 </DOCNO><TEXT>The linearised solutions to constraints in two-dimensional (2, 0) supergravityare given. We derive the superconformal ghost action in superspace. Theprocedure for deriving the non-linear (p, q) geometries of the (p, q+ 1) and (p + 1, q) local superspaces is given. We apply this to therewriting of the (1, 1) NSR superstring in (1, 0) superspace and expressingthe (2, 0) supergravity constraints in the lower superspace. Finally,a new form of D = 2, N = 1 supergravity is presented.</TEXT></DOC>
