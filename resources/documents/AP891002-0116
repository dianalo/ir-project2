(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rain, floods and a tornado dealt cruelnew blows today to those trying to rebuild their lives and townsdevastated by Hurricane Hugo.   The latest weather assault came amid a torrent of volunteer aidfrom across the country, an effort boosted Sunday by a $1,000 checkby former President Reagan.   Northeast of Charleston, a twister tore through the town ofLebanon early today, tossing a house trailer that had stood throughthe hurricane onto a road and injuring its two occupants. Neitherwas hurt seriously, said Doris Browder, a dispatcher at theBerkeley County Emergency Medical Service.   ``The trailer was slung across the road,'' she said. ``I'm suremost of their injuries were mental, not physical. They probably gotthrough the hurricane all right, then to have this happen.''   Heavy rain fell throughout South Carolina on Sunday and intoearly today, hampering cleanup efforts and forcing temporaryevacuation of 100 people in Anderson County in the state'snorthwest corner. No injuries were reported, and the peoplereturned to their homes when the flood threat eased a few hourslater.   Rain in South Carolina subsided by midmorning after about 2{inches fell on Charleston. In North Charleston, 10 miles away,about 2 inches of rain backed up storm sewers, scattered debris andhampered cleanup efforts.   ``I feel sorry for people. It's terrible. It adds insult toinjury,'' said Dick Schenot, meteorologist at the National WeatherService.   Torrential rain also fell on North Carolina residents trying toclean up Hugo's wreckage, and trees left leaning by the hurricaneleaned farther or fell because of saturated soil. The rain in NorthCaroline also swept a car into a creek, leaving three peoplemissing, and forced scores of people to evacuate.   Disaster followed catastrophe in Greeleyville, when a gasolinetanker truck exploded Sunday, injuring two and forcing 150 peopleto flee their homes for three hours for fear of an explosion inunderground storage tanks. The town of 720 was battered byHurricane Hugo as it tore across the state.   ``It would be terrible any time, but in connection witheverything else we've had, I'm sure it hit us a lot harder,''Greeleyville Mayor Doris Browder said of the blast.   The truck exploded Sunday as its driver was about to startpumping gas into storage tanks at a convenience store, leaving thedriver with second- and third-degree burns and the store owner withminor burns and bruises. The cause wasn't known.   Residents of hard-hit Charleston took time out Sunday to salutevolunteers who have chipped in with money and goods and traveled tothe historic city to help cut away splintered trees, clear debrisand lend a hand with other cleanup chores.   ``What you're doing will never be forgotten,'' Mayor JosephRiley told hundreds of weary workers who gathered at a rally Sundaydespite drizzle. ``People from all over the country came to help acommunity in need. We might have suffered some damage, but ourspirit is alive.''   Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn, planned to tour thedamaged areas by helicopter and work at disaster centers in MoncksCorner and Charleston this afternoon and Tuesday.   Hugo, which belted the city Sept. 21 with 135 mph winds, wheremore than 2,500 historically significant buildings were damaged.   ``These people need help,'' said Steve Desin, a volunteer whocame to Charleston directly from working on the Alaskan oil spillcleanup. ``This is what makes this country what it is. You can kickour butts, but we'll fight back.''   The Vallejo, Calif., native sent four vessels from his CheetahAviation Transport Service to ferry food, clothes and medicine tooffshore islands cut off by the storm.   The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which had 10 disasterapplication centers open Sunday, planned to add four more centerstoday, officials said. As of Sunday, 5,400 residents had appliedfor various forms of federal and state assistance.   Also today, beachfront property owners in Myrtle Beach, S.C.,were told they could begin applying for permits to repair seawalls,homes and businesses that were less than two-thirds damaged by thehurricane.   The Beachfront Management Act, enacted in 1988 to limitdevelopment along South Carolina's 187-mile coast over bitteropposition from many property owners, prohibits rebuilding orrepairs on shore structures that are more than two-thirds damaged.About 5,500 structures in North Myrtle Beach, Myrtle Beach andGeorgetown County were damaged or destroyed, said Donna Gress,spokeswoman for the South Carolina Coastal Council, which enforcesthe law.</TEXT></DOC>
