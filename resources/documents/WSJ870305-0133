YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROPBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bank regulators in the U.S. and Britain proposed a joint rule on how to account for various interest-rate and currency obligations when determining capital requirements for banks in the two nations.    The specific standards proposed yesterday by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bank of England grew out of a broader accord, reached in January, that proposed to link banks' capital reserves to the risk involved in their loans and investments.    The regulations proposed yesterday would cover, among other things, interest-rate and currency swaps. These transactions allow borrowers as well as investors to exchange fixed-rate obligations and floating-rate obligations for one another, or obligations in one currency for those in another. The swap market has grown to more than $300 billion and has become an essential part of the international capital market.    The proposed standards also cover options to buy or sell currencies and various debt securities, and agreements to buy or sell currencies at a specified future date. They would exclude daily foreign-exchange transactions and transactions arranged on futures and options exchanges, which the exchanges already require the banks to support.    U.S. banks generally do keep some capital as reserves for these deals in case they should fail, using various formulas to determine the amount, according to Fed officials. But such transactions generally aren't carried on a bank's balance sheet and so aren't included in its assets when calculating how much capital the institution must keep on hand. Currently, U.S. banks are required to maintain capital reserves equal to at least 6% of their assets.    In issuing the proposal for public comment, Fed officials noted concerns that increasing capital requirements could put U.S. banks at a competitive disadvantage against West German and Japanese banks and U.S. and foreign investment houses.    The Fed staff also recommended that, in the U.S., the proposed rules apply only to the 20 or 25 large bank-holding companies, generally those with assets exceeding $5 billion, that act as intermediaries in these transactions. This would exempt small institutions that use these transactions as a hedge against rapid fluctuations in interest and exchange rates. </TEXT></DOC>
