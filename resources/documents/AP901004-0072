The carrier and its battle group entered the waterway onTuesday.   The 79,000-ton Independence left through the Strait of Hormuz,the narrow outlet of the gulf, in the early afternoon.   The carrier and its battle group were sailing out to the ArabianSea, said a U.S. military source in the region who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   In Washington, a Defense Department public affairs officer, Lt.Cmdr. Edward Lundquist, confirmed that the Independence and itscrew had left the gulf because ``they completed their operationthere.''   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said, ``We consider the missionof the Independence in the gulf a success. The mission was todemonstrate to our friends and allies in the region that it ispossible to put a carrier in the gulf and carry out operations.Those were the goals, and they were accomplished.'' He said flightoperations were carried out.   He declined to say what the Independence would do next.   The carrier, with at least 70 aircraft aboard, had been insidethe gulf on a training mission. Few details had been publicized.   The gulf voyage was seen as a way of showing Saddam Hussein theextent of the U.S. naval air power in the U.S.-led military buildupconfronting him.   The Independence was ``not meant in any way to increase regionaltensions,'' Lt. Cmdr. Mark Walker, a Navy spokesman, had saidearlier. He said its presence was ``a visible demonstration of theoperational capabilities of a carrier battle group to our friendsand allies in the region.''   The Independence had been in the northern Arabian Sea sinceJuly, before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.   Aircraft carriers rarely enter the gulf because it is arestricted body of water that has a high volume of shipping,leaving little room for maneuvering. There is also only one outlet,the Strait of Hormuz. In addition, its aircraft can reach Iraq andKuwait even when the carrier is outside the gulf.   The last U.S. aircraft carrier to enter the gulf was theConstellation in 1974.</TEXT></DOC>
