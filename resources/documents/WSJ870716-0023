Lee, president, was elected chief executive officer of the real estate and agriculture limited partnership effective Aug. 1.    Mr. Lee, 45 years old, succeeds James F. Dickason, 65, who is retiring as chairman and chief executive. A company spokesman said Newhall doesn't expect to name a new chairman for at least a year. Gary M. Cusumano, 43, executive vice president, was named chief operating officer, succeeding Mr. Lee.    Separately, Newhall, which owns and is developing the Southern California community of Valencia, said second-quarter net income fell 30% to $6.7 million, or 32 cents a share, from $9.6 million, or 50 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue rose 3.3% to $39.5 million from $38.3 million.    Six-month net fell 28% to $11.7 million, or 56 cents a share, from $16.3 million, or 86 cents a share, on a 5.4% decline in revenue to $64.4 million from $68.1 million.    &quot;Reduced industrial land sales is the primary reason for lower revenues and income for 1987,&quot; Dickason said. &quot;Leasing activity in the Valencia Industrial Center is increasing, and vacant space continues to be absorbed at a healthy pace.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
