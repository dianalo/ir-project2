Bertrand G. Berube, fired in 1983 after he accused the GeneralServices Administration of becoming ``the nation's slumlord,'' saidhe will take early retirement in a settlement with the agency. Hehad been GSA's top regional director, overseeing all majorgovernment buildings in the Washington, D.C., area.   Despite the settlement ordered by the Merit Systems ProtectionBoard, Berube said laws are needed to prevent the government frompunishing other employees who disclose overspending and dangerousconditions and that the federal system to protect suchwhistle-blowers actually worked against him.   Berube, who says he is the highest ranking civil servant everfired for whistle-blowing, said federal employees should not thinkthey can duplicate what he did unless they have several hundredthousand dollars to spend on attorneys. He was defended by a publicinterest group that can afford to back only a fraction of those whogo against government employers, he said.   ``If a government employee has that kind of money, they'reusually not working for the government,'' said Berube. Those whothink they can get help from the special government counsel set upto protect whistle-blowers may find ``they're going to theexecutioner when they think they're going to the doctor,'' he said.   The special counsel for the merit board refused to take his caseand ended up testifying in Congress against him, saying there wereother grounds for firing him besides his criticism of waste, firedanger and health hazards in federal buildings, Berube said.   The GSA had claimed that Berube, who earned $64,000 a yearoverseeing 7,000 employees, engaged in ``irresponsiblesensationalism'' in describing GSA's problems.   Herb Koster, a spokesman for Gerald Carmen, former GSAadministrator who fired Berube, said Carmen would not comment onthe settlement signed Aug. 18. Carmen now heads the Federal AssetDisposition Association.   GSA spokesman Paul Costello said GSA officials also had nocomment on the agreement.   Thomas Devine, legal director for the Government AccountabilityProject which represents Berube and other government and privateindustry whistle-blowers, said rulings by the merit board duringits consideration of Berube's case further inhibit whistle-blowing.   ``Under the Berube standards, agencies have everything to gainand nothing to lose by opening up a witch hunt on awhistle-blower,'' he said.   Devine said that under the precedent, government agencies areallowed to look after-the-fact for reasons to justify a dismissal.   The Berube settlement agreement with GSA precludes furtherappeal by either side and says the settlement does not assume any``unlawful personnel practice, discrimination, reprisal or anyother unlawful or illegal acts'' by the agency or its officials.   Devine said neither the merit board nor the courts have doneanything to discourage government reprisals against whistle-blowingemployees.   The merit board's office of special counsel, which was set up torepresent whistle-blowers, ``actually has been a Troan horse forcivil servants who commit the truth,'' he said.   Berube said in a telephone interview over the weekend thatproblems with government buildings have gotten ``worse rather thanbetter'' since he was fired, with many buildings in seriousdisrepair while money is wasted. In a May 1983 memo, he had said 25percent of GSA buildings were unsafe and ``for all practicalpurposes, we're becoming the nation's slumlord.''   Berube said he agreed not to go back to the agency so he couldcontinue his successful woodworking business in Washington andcontinue to fight for whistle-blower legislation.   GSA spokesman Costello said Friday that a check for $530,000would shortly be made out to Berube and his lawyers.   Berube, 55, said that after legal fees he will get about$350,000, along with up to $430,000 in additional retirement paybased on his normal life expectancy. Lawyers said GSA also willhave to pay $24,000 into Berube's retirement account and reimbursethe $6,000 paid him in unemployment compensation.   Berube said he would retire with a $32,500 annual pension, basedon 26 years of government service, including the five years sincehe was fired. Berube said that without the settlement he would havereceived annual retirement pay of $18,000 when he turns 65.   A whistle-blower protection bill has passed the Senate. Houseleaders are discussing whether to consider similar legislationpassed by a House committee or a Reagan administration bill opposedby whistle-blowers.</TEXT></DOC>
