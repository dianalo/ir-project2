During the last 20 years, the average age of the nation's 2.3million public school teachers rose from 36 to 41, according tostatistics from the National Education Association. Unpublisheddata from the 1988 Current Population Survey of the Census Bureaushows that 48.4 percent are 40 or older.   Educators have usually invoked such statistics as evidence thatmass teacher retirements lie ahead _ with no certainty that theprofession is attractive enough to draw young recruits.   Half to 54 percent of the nation's teachers will be eligible forretirement by the year 2000, said Jewell Gould, research directorof the American Federation of Teachers.   This ``graying'' of the profession contains other worrisomemessages, several reformers believe. Age statistics suggest that adecade of school reform has been at least partly misdirected.   ``School reformers haven't looked a lot at the fact that in adecade, many of the teachers who will be in the schools are notthere now,'' said Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor at ColumbiaTeachers College and an authority on the teaching profession.   Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for theAdvancement of Teaching, said the numbers mean the nation hadbetter pay more heed to improving the training of the nextgeneration of teachers. He said this group will carry the burden ofreform for years to come.   He said it was a mistake to focus almost exclusively on presentteachers.   ``Both older and younger teachers have to be considered, but ifI were to draw a conclusion, I'd say we have been far tooneglectful of educating the new generation of teachers who will bedetermining where schools will be going in the first quarter of the21st century,'' said Boyer in a recent interview.   Darling-Hammond added it's generally easier to train a newteacher in reform techniques such as team teaching than it is topersuade a veteran teacher to break long-cherished classroom habits.   Some teacher colleges have begun to address these problems. The``Holmes Group,'' a coalition of about 100 education schoolsinterested in reform, is fostering programs allowing studentteachers to practice new techniques in public school classrooms.Several such programs have started recently in Michigan, forexample.   The rise in the average age of teachers during the last twodecades mirrors declining student enrollments and tight stateschool budgets. Those trends have been most pronounced in theMidwest and Northeast.   Not all states keep teacher age data. But a check of statedepartments of education and local union affiliates found theaverage age of teachers in Connecticut, for example, is 43.3; inGeorgia, 42; Indiana, 42; Michigan, 44; Maryland, 41.1; and NewJersey, 42.5.   The median age in New York was 42.4 as the 1988-89 school year,and 25.1 percent of the teaching force is 49 or older.   In Massachusetts, suffering the effects of a decade-old taxrevolt measure and a worsening budget crisis, the average age is 47.   By contrast, teachers in New Mexico, a Sunbelt state with agrowing student population, average 37.7.   Reformers concerned over average age emphasize they don't meanto belittle the skills of veteran teachers.   ``More experienced teachers are more productive. They just won'tmake the mistakes a younger teacher would,'' said Gould.   Nonetheless, the age statistics lend urgency to the need toupdate the skills of veteran teachers and create more collegialenvironments in public schools, said Darling-Hammond.   ``By and large, teacher effectiveness increases during the firstfive to seven years of a career, then levels off and may evendecline. Whether that happens depends on the school environment.Collegial environments that have lots of opportunities to developand learn help foster professional growth. But that's nottypical,'' she said.   Educators believe that school improvement is most likely to takeroot in schools with a balanced mix of young and old teachers.   ``From what I see, whether or not a person is willing to take alook at innovative ideas has little to do with age,'' said KeithGeiger, president of the National Education Association. ``I hearas many innovative ideas from 50 year-olds as 25 year-olds.''   But statistics suggest that the balance has swung toward aheavier concentration of veteran teachers, many of whom have seenreform waves come and go with little apparent effect and may beviewing current reform efforts skeptically.   ``I think all teachers want to be part of exciting changes,''Boyer said. ``But we have to ask: Which teachers will be preparedto harness technology? Will they be prepared to deal with anincreasingly bilingual population? Will they be prepared to becreative and not just conforming?''</TEXT></DOC>
