Officials, responding to a report in the Los Angeles Times,stressed that Bush had suspended shipments _ not ended them _ afterthe Beijing government cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators.   The Chinese engineers, who apparently did not leave the UnitedStates over the summer, returned during the last few weeks to theGrumman factory in Bethpage, N.Y., ``to provide technical supportwhich will enable U.S. work to continue during the suspension,'' aState Department official said.   The main parts of the deal with China are a program to improveavionics on F-8 jets and the manufacture of torpedos, radar andartillery ammunition.   ``In view of the long-term interest of the United States, it hasalways been the president's intention to suspend _ not terminate _US-People's Republic of China FMS (foreign military sales)programs, with the hope that circumstances would permit aresumption of normal relations,'' said the official, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Still, the official added: ``There are no deliveries. Thepresident's decision remains in effect.''   The sanctions imposed by Bush were considered inadequate byseveral members of Congress who called for harsher measures as anexpression of U.S. human rights convictions.   The bloody June 4 crackdown on students in Tiananmen Square inBeijing was seen by millions of Americans on television,contributing to public criticism here of the Communist governmentas it reversed a moderating trend.   But Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III emphasizedthen that maintaining strong ties with Beijing was in the strategicinterest of the United States.   Two other sanctions, apart from a halt to weapons deliveries,have been reversed or watered down since June.   The president's ban on the visit of high-level U.S. officials toChina did not preclude Baker from meeting with Qian Qichen, theChinese foreign minister, at a conference on Cambodia in Paris atthe end of July.   Also, dependents of American diplomats who were evacuated fromthe U.S. Embassy in Beijing and U.S. consulates returned weekslater.   On Monday, former President Richard Nixon, the most prominentAmerican to visit China since the military crackdown, called on thetwo nations to restore good relations and urged Chinese leaders toshun the ``backwater of oppression and stagnation'' and respect theyearnings of their people.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Nixon spoke withBush and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft before he leftfor China. However, Fitzwater said he did not know if Nixon wascarrying a letter from Bush to the Chinese leadership.   Responding to Nixon's call for normalized relations between thetwo countries, Fitzwater said:   ``We have always said that we want to resume good relations withChina at some point. The question really is, when and under whatconditions? I would say that at this point we have not reached thattime and we have not seen the right conditions.''</TEXT></DOC>
