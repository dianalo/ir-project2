<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-0195 </DOCNO><TEXT>Silicon detectors (SDs) have been used in nuclear physics for a long time.The typical field of application of SDs is the measurement of the energyloss (dE/dx) and of the total energy E of highly ionizing particles.Recently SDs have been introduced in elementary-particle physics forshort-lifetime measurements and for precision-tracking determination.The fast development of very large scale integration (VLSI) electronicsnow allows large solid angle coverage for tracking with an accuracy ofa few microns. More recently, SDs have been used in calorimeters thatmeasure the electron or photon energy by counting the particles generatedin the electromagnetic shower development. The first prototype of a hadroncalorimeter is now being constructed by the SI-CA-PO Collaboration toverify experimentally in a test beam the possibility of producing equalresponse (or equal energy deposited in the SD of the calorimeter) forhadrons or electrons of the same incident energy (e/h = 1). 5 refs.,7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
