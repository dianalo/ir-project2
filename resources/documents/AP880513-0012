The committee voice vote Thursday came two days after the Housevoted 413-4 for a similar bill to regulate a potential weapon ofchoice for terrorists in the future.   Plastic guns are not a problem now, because nobody is makingthem. A company that possesses a patent to develop plastic weapons,Red Eye Arms of Winter Park, Fla., says it's only interested indeveloping guns for the military at this time.   The legislation is advancing quickly without the rancor thatusually accompanies gun control issues. The breakthrough came whenlaw enforcement groups heavily lobbied Attorney General Edwin MeeseIII to support what is now the Senate Judiciary Committee language,and he agreed.   Once it became clear that no existing small metal handguns wouldbe banned, the powerful National Rifle Association agreed to goalong with the bill, sponsored by Sens. Howard M. Metzenbaum,D-Ohio, and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.   Metzenbaum said he hopes to win a unanimous Senate agreement forquick floor action. The legislation, he said, is needed ``toprotect our airplanes, our court houses and our public buildings.''   Thurmond added: ``The Secret Service has expressed concern overits reliance on metal detection equipment at the White House and atother events attended by the president, because this equipment canbe circumvented by firearms with insufficient metal.   ``As a result, the lives of the president and other high-levelofficials who depend on this equipment are at great risk _ a riskwhich will be reduced by adoption of this bill.''   The Senate legislation, while aimed at plastic weapons, wouldrequire that all firearms be as detecable as a 3.7-ounce stainlesssteel handgun. All guns currently manufactured or imported into theUnited States would meet the test.   While the Senate bill sets a dectability standard, theHouse-passed measure requires that the gun itself contain 3.7ounces of metal. The House bill, sponsored by Rep. William J.Hughes, D-N.J., deals specifically with plastic guns, while theSenate measure sets a standard for firearms in general.   The Senate measure also would require all guns to be detectableby X-ray machines used at airports.   All federal security checkpoints would have to be equipped withmetal detectors capable of distinguishing a 3.7-ounce stainlesssteel gun from innocuous metal articles commonly carried byindividuals.   The standard would require that state-of-the-art magnetometersbe installed.   Other Senate provisions would prohibit possession of a firearmin a federal courtroom; and increase penalties for some offenses,including illegal possession of explosives in airports and use orpossession of explosives in commission of a federal felony.</TEXT></DOC>
