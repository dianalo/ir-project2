FRAZIER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega told apacked National Assembly session that the United States'take-it-or-leave-it attitude forced the collapse of talks about hisleaving power.   ``The world must know that the conversation sustained with theenvoy of President Reagan broke down when he presented us with anultimatum in which Panama had to immediately accept his lastoffer,'' Noriega said.   ``I know it and I say so because I was there. (U.S. Secretary ofState) George Shultz wasn't there,'' Noriega said in his speechThursday to a cheering crowd in the 500-seat assembly chamber.   Outside the chamber of the 67-member assembly, hundreds ofpeople listened to his words through a loudspeaker.   Noriega, who commands Panama's 15,000-strong Defense Forces andis his country's de facto leader, did not elaborate. Shultz onWednesday announced the breakdown of talks and blamed Noriega.   The general said Thursday that Panama had accepted several U.S.proposals, but added: ``Even this wasn't sufficient. The UnitedStates desired an ultimatum.''   In exchange for Noriega's stepping down, the Reaganadministration had offered to lift economic sanctions it imposed onPanama after the general was indicted on U.S. drug traffickingcharges in February.   It also offered to have the indictments dismissed.   The White House still recognizes the presidency of Eric ArturoDelvalle, whom the Noriega-dominated National Assembly deposed Feb.26 after Delvalle tried to fire the general.   Noriega appeared before the assembly to answer questions aboutwhat the government insists on calling ``conversations,'' notnegotiations, on a possible arrangement under which he wouldrelinquish power.   Asked whether his resignation had been discussed, the generalreplied: ``The commander doesn't abandon his ship in stormyweather.''   Noriega said Panama has become a pawn for U.S. politicalcandidates and charged them with ``using the flag of Panama inwhatever way is convenient for them.''   He said some candidates want ``to bury files that weigh on theirshoulders,'' but did not explain.   Vice President George Bush, the likely Republican presidentialnominee, has been accused of having detailed knowledge of Noriega'salleged links to Colombian cocaine traffickers before the generalwas indicted.   Bush denies the allegations.   Noriega on Thursday repeated his conditions for stepping down:Extra troops sent to U.S. bases in Panama must be withdrawn and theposition of Manuel Solis Palma, who took over as president afterDelvalle's ouster, must be guaranteed.   Earlier, Solis Palma told a women's organization that U.S.negotiators told Noriega in March to be out of the country in 48hours or face the consequences. When Noriega refused, Solis Palmasaid, the Americans softened their manner. He did not elaborate onwhat was meant by ``consequences.''   Solis Palma said the final U.S. offer was to drop the drugcharges against Noriega in return for his giving up command of theDefense Forces on Aug. 12 and leaving Panama in September.   He said the United States also had promised to release $50million in Panamanian assets frozen in American banks if a nationalunity Cabinet was chosen that picked a president ``who could not beSolis Palma.''   Meanwhile, President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala offered tomediate a solution to the impasse.   Cerezo told reporters in Guatemala City on Thursday that Panamais experiencing ``a radicalization against the United States thatis dangerous for the region and that moreover is causing gravedamages to the Panamanian nation.''   He said he had spoken with U.S. and Panamanian officials on``the possibility of a plan aimed at finding a space for dialoguein Panama to consolidate a democratic process.''   Cerezo met on Thursday with James Michel, the U.S. ambassador toGuatemala. Cerezo also told reporters he recently heldconversations with Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of Panama'sopposition Christian Democrats.   Arias Calderon said Thursday that the U.S. negotiators failed tostrike a deal with Noriega because of a growing division in thePanamanian military of which the United States was not aware.   ``Errors by the United States were not the only factor althoughthey were a factor,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
