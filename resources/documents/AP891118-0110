Congress in 1974 enacted the historic Employee Retirement IncomeSecurity Act to protect retirees from abuses in their pensionplans. Already complex at its birth, the law has remained fluid andfurther changes are proposed.   In moving to reshape the system, lawmakers must walk a fine linebetween strengthening protection for workers and retirees andcreating even more complicated laws that could cause some employersto terminate plans.   ``Increasing regulations make it more difficult,'' said KathyUtgoff, the former head of the Pension Benefit GuarantyCorporation, which is the federal insurer of pension funds.   ``People will start bailing out,'' she warns.   The nation's private pension system is huge, with assests of $2trillion in plans that cover 76 million Americans.   The measures before Congress cover a host of pension issues.Some would limit employers' ability to drain surpluses from pensionfunds. One would increase the premium companies pay to the PensionBenefit Guaranty Corporation, which is $1.5 billion in the red.Still others would increase penalties for violations and requiremore thorough auditing.   One of the most pressing issues is regulation of surplus moneyin pension plans. Many programs grew during the years of a risingbull stock market. Now, the excess dollars are an inviting targetfor corporate raiders or managements seeking to pay off debts.   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., refers to the pension surpluses as``an almost irresistable, unguarded bank vault.''   Since 1980, about $20 billion in these ``overfunded'' pensionassets have been taken out of funds by employers. In pensionparlance, this is called reversion.   Current law says a surplus can be taken only if a plan isterminated and has enough money to pay off its obligations toretirees.   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has proposed legislation thatwould require employers to establish a new pension plan beforewithdrawing money from the old one.   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins has introduced a bill that would allowthe excess money to be transferred into health programs.   Last week, Rep. Bill Hughes, D-N.J., held a one-day hearing inhis select committee on aging to look into charges of possiblefraud and abuse in the system. Those warnings have been coming fromthe Labor Department's own inspector general's office.   The acting inspector general, Raymond Maria, told the hearingthere is a ``window of opportunity'' for fraud because of laxenforcement of existing laws, dependance on civil rather thancriminal remedies and inadequate audits of plan reports.   An assistant labor secretary, George David Ball, said he wouldlook into Maria's recommendations but testified that the pensionsystem has ``never been healthier.''   Hughes dismissed such assurances, saying, ``I heard the samesectors saying the savings and loan situation wasn't serious fiveyears ago.'' He called the amount of money in the system ``aninvitation to disaster.''   Hughes said stricter enforcement is needed to identifyviolators. ``Unless we have criminal penalties, severe criminalpenalties for those who commit egregious offenses, you're not goingto deter,'' he said.   He is asking the General Accounting Office to examine some 1,600pension plan investigations handled by the Labor Department in1988. Only 23 of those were classified as criminal cases.   Hughes said he doesn't believe increased legislation would causeemployers any undue hardships. ``You hear the same argument anytime you tighten laws.''   But Dallas L. Salisbury, president of the Employee BenefitResearch Institute, a trade group, said in an interview there``must be a balance between enough regulation and enough reportingto not have fraud and not make it so overwhelming in your effort todo so.''   There appear to be no definitive figures on how many smallbusinesses opt out of pension plans because of regulation. Thefederal insurer received notificaion of 10,790 terminations inplans of all sizes in 1988.   Hazel Witte of the U.S. Small Business Administration said it iscompleting a study on the subject.   Lisa Phillips, an aide to Lantos, said Congress must not pushtoo hard. Employers already are burdened with paperwork andauditing expenses, she said.   ``There is no law requiring a pension fund. When you regulateit, you get withdrawals,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
