There are several cloudy spots in their crystal balls, however,thanks to some unusual trends and unfolding events that defymeasurement.   The drought in the Farm Belt, for one, looms as a potential wildcard whose long-term economic implications cannot yet be gauged.   In addition, there is the presidential election coming inNovember, the outcome of which seems likely to affect in unknownways the continued progress of an economic expansion that will beentering its seventh year about the time the voters go to the polls.   Four years ago, many forecasters felt safe in assuming thatPresident Reagan would be re-elected and would make no dramaticchanges in economic policy. This time, there is widespreaduncertainty about which candidate will prevail and on what sort ofplatform.   By almost all accounts, the economy enters the second half ofthe year in sounder shape than anyone dared hope last winter.   Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch CapitalMarkets, projects growth of the gross national product, afteradjustment for inflation at a 3.6 percent rate for all of 1988, upfrom 2.9 percent last year.   The economy, he said, ``is in transition from being led by the1983-1986 consumer spending boom to being led in 1987-1989 by tradeand net exports.''   The White House on Thursday revised its growth estimate for 1988upward, to 3.5 percent from an earlier prediction of 2.9 percent.   In the view of a good many analysts, continued improvement islikely in the trade deficit, led by the export boom.   ``It is now clear that the U.S. trade deficit is declining,''said Robert Barbera at the investment firm of Shearson LehmanHutton Inc.   ``Material improvement in U.S. trade and a bottom for the U.S.dollar are the most fundamental issues confronting U.S. and worldfinancial markets.''   One big question that remains for the outlook is whether theeconomy will reach the point where expansion turns into aninflationary force.   According to Straszheim, ``although growth seems secure for1988, rising inflation and interest rates suggest the economy isvulnerable to a modest recession in 1989.''   Allen Sinai, chief economist at The Boston Co. Economic AdvisorsInc., says the economy has entered ``the full employment zone''where capacity of operating facilities and the labor force couldbegin to show signs of strain.   ``The problem for economic policies in the U.S. is to somehowtraverse the full employment zone without an unacceptableacceleration of inflation and the instability that has alwayscreated a turning point for the expansion and, then, a subsequentrecession,'' he asserts.   If the drought in the Midwest continues much longer, analystssay its effects could start to spread beyond the region and thefarm economy.   Rising prices of basic commodities that become scarcer thanexpected because of the drought naturally evoke visions ofincreased inflation. However, some observers say the effect maymore complicated than that.   As David Resler, chief economist at Nomura SecuritiesInternational, suggested: ``Over the next several months, risingfood prices are likely to absorb a growing portion of most people'sbudgets, since food demand is generally insensitive to price.   ``But this may serve to intensify consumer resistance to priceincreases on other goods. Thus, unless income growth suddenlyaccelerates, real consumer spending can be expected to remainsoft.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Friday June 24</NOTE></DOC>
