They broke windows, smashed furniture and scribbled slogans onthe walls of the reception area, according to company spokesmanSubramanium Kumaraswamy.   ``We Will Not Allow UCC To Get Away With Murder!'' protestersoutside yelled. Nobody was injured in the melee, which lasted 20minutes, Kumaraswamy said. The Danbury, Conn.-based multinationalasked for police protection.   The protesters were among about 800 victims who came to New Delhifrom the central town of Bhopal to demand the Supreme Court scrapits Feb. 14 order that Union Carbide pay $470 million as ``full andfinal'' settlement to victims of the 1984 accident. India'sgovernment agreed to the settlement after originally suing for $3billion.   It was the world's worst industrial accident, killing at least3,400 people and injuring more than 20,000. Four years later, peoplestill are dying from effects of the gas leak at the pesticide plant.   Police and paramilitary troops searched those entering the court,whose main gates were locked against 800 demonstrators squatting inthe road.   Inside, the court heard the petition of C.L. Sahu, a victimchallenging the government's right to pass the Bhopal Gas LeakDisaster Act 1985, which made it the sole representative of all gasvictims.   Sahu's attorney, R.K. Garg, said the act denied fundamentalrights to life and livelihood guaranteed by India's Constitution. It``challenged the concept of India as a free nation,'' Garg argued.He said the government erred in failing to hold Union Carbide liablefor the disaster.   Chief Justice Raghunandan S. Pathak last week appointed fivejudges to hear the case. They were chosen after Judge E.S.Venkataramiah, one of five judges who ordered the Feb. 14settlement, quit the panel because of widespread criticism of theagreement.   Opposition politicians, newspapers, prominent citizens and gasvictims say the government settled for too little.   Union Carbide deposited the entire amount with the court on Feb.24. It is being held while judges decide whether to admit petitionschallenging the order. About 570,000 people filed claims with thegovernment that they were affected by the lethal leak of methylisocyanate on Dec. 3, 1984.   ``If the court has any respect for the voice of the people, itwill change,'' said one of the demonstrators, Abdul Jabbar Khan ofthe Bhopal Gas Victims Women's Industrial Organization.   The hearings continue Thursday. Judges must decide whether theywill admit the petition for review of the court's judgment, whichabsolved Union Carbide of all liability, civil and criminal.   Union Carbide says the accident was sabotage by a disgruntledemployee. The government says it was caused by negligence.</TEXT></DOC>
