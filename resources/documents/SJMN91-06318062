He listened to hisfriends, most of whom offered assessments as bleak as Hunt's, and then herolled the dice one last time: He would be contrite, he would ask for anotherchance -- and he would run again.;   Not even Edwards, however, could haveguessed the results -- that a silver-haired cajun known as Fast Eddie wouldemerge as the one and only alternative to David Duke.;   Having to choose thelesser of two evils has become an increasingly familiar complaint among votersin this country. Rarely has the lament been more appropriate than indescribing many Louisianans who plan to vote for Edwards in this Saturday'sgubernatorial election. People who spent their careers fighting what they sawas Edwards' sleazy brand of patronage politics are now, when faced with theprospect of being governed by a white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klanmember, working feverishly to send Edwards back for a fourth term.;   Not evena close call; &quot;This was not even a close call,&quot; said Dave Treen, the formerRepublican governor who was defeated by Edwards in 1983 and never had a kindword to say about his longtime rival until this campaign.;   &quot;You put Duke andEdwards on a scale and one is an absolute and complete horror,&quot; Treen said.&quot;To beat Duke one must vote for Edwards -- that's the reality, whether anyonelikes it or not.&quot;;   The Edwards coalition is the ultimate statement ofpolitical realism. Along with black Louisianans, who have always felt a strongbond with Edwards, his supporters include environmentalists who once chargedthat he was nature's worst enemy, newspaper editorial boards accustomed toexcoriating his rapscallion ways, business leaders who for years argued thathe was too friendly to labor, and good government watchdogs who could nottolerate the wheeling and dealing that was the modus operandi of hisadministration.;   At a recent candidate forum where Duke expressedbewilderment at the array of forces aligned against him, Edwards rejoined:&quot;David, I too have been shocked by some of the endorsements I've gotten, andif it weren't for you I wouldn't have gotten them.&quot;;   The extraordinary turnof events in this campaign has had a strange effect on Edwards, his friendssay. While things have turned out better than he could have hoped, nothing hasgone as he planned, making him feel, for the first time in his life, that hehad little control of his own destiny. &quot;I see it in Edwin's face,&quot; said Hunt.&quot;There's a certain resignation there, almost a sadness. You'd have to knowEdwin to understand it.&quot;;   Primitive mission;   Edwards began the campaignwith a simple, primitive mission: revenge. More than anything, he wanted todefeat the reformer, Buddy Roemer, who not only ousted him four years ago butthen switched parties while in office, joining the Republicans.;   After heand Duke combined to eliminate Roemer in the Oct. 19 primary, where the toptwo finishers survived for a runoff, Edwards found himself without the targethe had been aiming at and with an unlikely congregation of newfound friends.In recent weeks he has acted as though he had to pinch himself to believe it.;  &quot;I have an unbelievable opportunity that I never thought I'd have one yearago, six months ago, three months ago,&quot; Edwards said recently. &quot;I wasn't sureI'd ever have the chance to leave the legacy I wanted, and now all of a suddenit's all right here in front of me. I'm 64 years old and this is my lastchance to do things right. I'm not going to blow it.&quot;;   Although Duke'sextremism has made Edwards the favorite in the race, Duke's populist style hasessentially stripped Edwards of his old persona and made him appear cautiousand uncertain during this campaign.;   'He's one of us';   The Edwards style,for nearly 50 years, since he ran a campaign at Pelican Boys State camp in1943, had been modeled on the charismatic populism of Huey Long. &quot;Un de nousautres,&quot; the cajuns always said of him -- &quot;he's one of us.&quot;;   In the Octoberprimary, however, Duke received more votes than Edwards in most of the cajunparishes, and Edwards now is seen not so much as one of the working people asthe choice of image-conscious business leaders and professionals.;   The oldEdwin Edwards, the one who used to joke about his philandering that &quot;the onlyway I'll get in trouble is if I'm caught in bed with a dead girl or a liveboy,&quot; the one who after his 1983 triumph raised money to pay off his campaignby taking two jumbo jetloads of lobbyists on a tour of Paris at $10,000 perperson -- has been put away for a more sober, serious Edwards of 1991.;   Itremains uncertain whether the new, serious mien and the even newer coalitionwill change the way Edwards operates if he is elected governor.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID MARANISS, Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New Orleans  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911113  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,084  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 13, 199100318062,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
