The new brokerage and investment-banking firm, Citicorp Mercado de Capitales C.A., is owned 49% by Citicorp Overseas Investment Corp. and 51% by local investors. Officials here said the firm will underwrite and trade in corporate stocks and bonds in Venezuela and abroad. In New York, Citicorp confirmed details of the Caracas unit's announcement.    Venezuela began a program of debt-equity swaps and debt capitalization in April. Although no swaps have been completed, companies have capitalized $25 million of foreign debt under the program so far, according to Venezuelan officials.    &quot;We are hoping that the new firm can help in debt-equity swaps,&quot; said a Citibank spokesman, Alberto Caldera. One of the goals of the new firm is to widen Venezuela's capital market by introducing new financial instruments. Citicorp's Venezuelan unit recently introduced the use of warrants in Venezuela in designing a debenture issue by a major local cement company.    The unit underlined a new emphasis on corporate business last month by deciding to close accounts under 50,000 bolivars ($3,450). The bank also trimmed its staff about 20%, to 359 employees in its four Venezuelan offices.    Citibank is the only wholly foreign-owned U.S. bank in Venezuela. The new joint venture is its first here. </TEXT></DOC>
