Bass, continuing his relentless pursuit of information services companies, has purchased a 40% stake for an undisclosed price in the Times Publishing Co., parent of the prestigious St. Petersburg Times.    The billionaire heir to a Texas oil fortune has been on the prowl for another media concern ever since he withdrew his $2 billion offer for Macmillan Inc. Mr. Bass's Robert M. Bass Group Inc. was particularly interested in Macmillan's hidden treasure: information services, which is far and away Macmillan's fastest-growing and most profitable segment. Mr. Bass also has significant investments in broadcasting, cable television and pay-per-view movies to hotels.    But for Mr. Bass, the Times Publishing Co., St. Petersburg, Fla., and, in particular, the St. Petersburg Times, offers an opportunity to own a major stake in one of the country's most highly acclaimed and profitable newspapers. &quot;It has the reputation as one of the best in the country,&quot; says John Morton, a media analyst. The paper has won at least two Pulitzer Prizes in recent years.    The paper also has a reputation as a money cow, thanks to its considerable market dominance. The St. Petersburg Times has daily circulation of 339,428, representing 67% of the market; Sunday circulation of 429,053 represents 83%.    Closely held Times Publishing also owns two Washington-based publications -- Congressional Quarterly, which covers Capitol Hill, and Governing, which covers state and local governments. It also owns three state business magazines in Florida, Georgia and Arizona. Industry analysts value the company at about $650 million.    In the St. Petersburg editorial offices, the idea of a wheeler-dealer Texas billionaire controlling such a huge block of stock came as &quot;a jolt,&quot; said Andrew Barnes, the new editor, president and chief executive officer of Times Publishing. Mr. Barnes said Mr. Bass phoned him to tell him the news and assured him that he &quot;didn't want to disturb&quot; anything.    The company's late publisher, Nelson Poynter, had sought to keep the paper out of the hands of major corporate owners by putting 60% of the voting stock into the Poynter Institute, a tax-exempt educational institute for newspaper industry employees. But Mr. Poynter's sister, Eleanor, was often at odds with her brother over keeping the paper independent. So some newspaper watchers weren't surprised that Eleanor's descendants, two daughters who inherited 200 shares of voting stock, sold their 40% stake to Mr. Bass. </TEXT></DOC>
