The government yesterday released the full texts of the resolutions passed at last week's historic Communist Party conference, including one that contains clear criticism of Soviet law-enforcement agencies. While the resolutions don't name the KGB, Russian initials for Committee of State Security, its inclusion is clearly implied.    For instance, the resolutions talk about the need to &quot;eliminate abuses&quot; and raise the standards and education of police and to &quot;systematically publish&quot; information about the work of &quot;law-enforcement agencies.&quot;    During the conference, the KGB, the dreaded secret police organization that carried out Josef Stalin's bloody purges and sought to crush the dissident movement under Leonid Brezhnev, came in for veiled criticism. Mr. Gorbachev in his opening speech spoke of improving the work of the Interior Ministry bodies &quot;in which, as we are all aware, major mistakes, and unfortunately abuses, have been committed.&quot;    But neither he nor other speakers who touched on the KGB dared give details of what they meant. Indeed, Yegor Ligachev, second only to Mr. Gorbachev, told conferees in his long, emotional speech that KGB chief Viktor Chebrikov was one of the men who helped vault Mr. Gorbachev into the general secretary's job in l985. This may mean that, despite his criticism, Mr. Gorbachev is unwilling or unable to wage an all-out attack on the KGB.    Since Lenin, the Soviet leadership has never questioned the need for a big security police apparatus, and Mr. Gorbachev is probably no different from his predecessors. But much of what the KGB stands for -- excessive secrecy, fear, the forceful crushing of any political initiative -- are aspects of Soviet life that Mr. Gorbachev has publicly said he wants to change.    How he'll go about this isn't clear, although there may be more clues after a Central Committee meeting later this month that is supposed to implement the conference resolutions. Mr. Gorbachev talks about the need for the rule of law and says he wants to ensure the independence of courts, prosecutors and judges from outside interference. The party conference also agreed that most criminal cases should be handled by a new, autonomous department of investigators who can't be pushed around so easily.    Viktor Afanasyev, the editor of Pravda, told a news conference last week, &quot;We believe the KGB is needed, although it should be more under the control of the party than now.&quot;    But the complaints and talk of abuses are the most direct attacks so far on the highly secretive police and security organizations, which so far have largely evaded Mr. Gorbachev's drive for greater openness and less corruption, something that hasn't escaped the notice of Soviet citizens. Taking a break from last week's conference, Valentina Kazachishina, a delegate from Minsk, was appalled to find downtown Moscow swarming with police and KGB agents.    &quot;What is this -- a return to old times?&quot; she asked rhetorically. Ms. Kazachishina, who works in a radio factory, complained to a Soviet newspaper that officers were blocking off the streets and subway entrances and rudely asking people for their papers. &quot;From the rostrum we talk about glasnost and democracy, while out here we organize a regime of controls,&quot; she said. &quot;Who are we afraid of?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
