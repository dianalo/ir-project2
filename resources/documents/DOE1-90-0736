Self-similarityof the processes of multiple fracture permits interpreting the processof damage accumulation as that of growth of self-similar fractal cluster.Avalanche-like growth of the claster is considered to be the beginningof macrofracture. Fractal cluster growth equations in the approximationof the medium field theory are reduced in a case of fatigue fractureto the already known Coffin-Manson dependence and exponential distributionof the number of defects depending on their sizes.</TEXT></DOC>
