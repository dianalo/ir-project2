He said the Republicans were returning to tactics of the 1930sand 1950s in ``attacking my patriotism (but) the American peoplecan smell the garbage.''   In Dallas later, where Dukakis endorsed making the District ofColumbia a state, the Democratic nominee gained a strong statementof support from former rival Jesse Jackson. Appearing, as Dukakisdid, before a black religious group, Jackson said of theMassachusetts governor: ``Accept my recommendation. He can betrusted to help keep hope alive.''   Bush, asked by reporters on a campaign stop in Illinois if hewere indeed questioning Dukakis' patriotism, responded, ``I'm notsaying that. ... I'm just questioning his judgment on the issuesthe American people are interested in.''   Later, at a rally in York, Pa., before a flag-waving crowd, Bushresponded to Dukakis' remarks, saying: ``I understand that todaythe liberal governor of Massachusetts attacked me for questioningthe patriotism, his patriotism. I'm not questioning hispatriotism.'' Then the vice president added: ``I'm questioning hisjudgment.'' The crowd of thousands roared its approval.   In Washington, Bush campaign aide Mark Goodin accused Dukakis of``strident name-calling'' and said, ``The American people aregetting a good look at the real Michael Dukakis and his views andthey simply don't like what they see.''   Bush, in criticizing Dukakis on national defense and otherissues in recent days, has used the phrase about not questioning anopponent's patriotism but questioning his judgment.   The Democratic presidential nominee, campaigning in Bush'sadopted home state, delivered a stinging assault _ his strongestyet in an effort to put his campaign back on the offensive at atime when he is slipping in the polls.   Dukakis referred to recent news accounts that top advisers tothe Bush campaign represented a Bahamian official underinvestigation for involvement with drugs and said: ``I don'tquestion Mr. Bush's patriotism, but I do question his judgment.''   He repeated the sentence over and over as he cited Bush's rolein the Iran-Contra affair, alleged corruption in the Reaganadministration and other charges.   ``Today, here in Texas and in nearly 30 states throughout thecountry, we're giving George Bush 60 days notice _ 60 days noticethat we're going to beat him on election day,'' Dukakis said.   The speech was still being written as Dukakis flew to Texas fromNew York, and campaign chairman Paul Brountas said much of therewriting was done by Dukakis himself.   He spoke to an estimated 5,000 people at East Texas StateUniversity, a site that was selected because it was the alma materof the late U.S. House Speaker Sam Rayburn, a revered figure in theeast Texas area that is considered a key battleground in theDukakis-Bush race.   Dukakis said that when Rayburn led legislative reforms of WallStreet and public utilities in the 1930s, ``Republicans puttogether the biggest and most vicious campaign'' against him.   ``They attacked Sam Rayburn and Franklin Roosevelt, and theycalled them communists,'' Dukakis said. Rayburn, he said, replied,``I'm a conservative, but even a conservative can smell garbage inhis front yard.''   ``Sam Rayburn knew that when you fight for the real people, theother side will attack your patriotism,'' Dukakis said. ``He saw itagain in the 1950s when the Republicans cheered as Joseph McCarthyslandered good Democrats as communists.'   ``And those Republican tactics haven't chagned,'' Dukakis said.``Just as they did to Franklin Roosevelt and Sam Rayburn, they'renow attacking my patriotism. And just as they did in the 1930s andthe 1950s, the American people can smell the garbage.''   Dukakis spoke of his support for a new federal law, opposed byBush and running mate Dan Quayle, that requires employers to give60 days notice to employees before factories are closed.   The Dukakis campaign began airing commercials in Texas this weekhammering at the Republicans on that plant closing bill.   The campaign was holding rallies around the country noting thatthere are now about 60 days to election day. They were circulatingpink handbills _ ``pink slips'' _ that said Bush would be put outof work.   Dukakis later went to Dallas where, speaking to the NationalBaptist Convention U.S.A., a large, predominantly black religiousgroup, he endorsed the idea of statehood for Washington, D.C. Healso met privately with Jackson for about 15 minutes beforeaddressing the group.   ``In just 60 days, we can elect a president who will strengthenour voting rights laws, not undermine them; who will fight for theuniversal voter registration bill now before the Congress, and whowill stand by the people of District of Columbia in their strugglefor full statehood and equal rights,'' Dukakis said.   The candidate canceled plans to then fly to New Orleans for arally and fund-raiser. Campaign trip director Jack Weeks said thethreat posed by hurricane Florence was the reason.   Brountas said Dukakis' tough new attack on Bush followed ``anumber of events that have occurred.'' He referred to reports thatpeople with anti-Semitic views were given posts in the Bushcampaign and that a firm with ties to Bush campaign manager LeeAtwater received $800,000 for lobbying on behalf of the Bahamianprime minister who is under a drug investigation.   ``This is the issue of leadership, leadership differentiated byjudgment, and he's talking to the vice president's judgment,''Brountas said.   Dukakis flew to nearby Greenville, Texas, where he was greetedoutside the airport by school children and a high school marchingband. Dukakis stopped his motorcade in front of the band, which wasplaying a Republican theme, ``God Bless the U.S.A.'' He borrowed atrumpet and played ``Happy Days Are Here Again,'' a Democraticstandard.   Dukakis, citing, Bush campaign officials' ties to the firm thatlobbied for the Bahamian official, said, ``These advisers, or theirrepresentatives, had over a dozen meetings with the vicepresident's staff, and used their personal relationships throughoutthe government to help their client.''   He blasted Bush's ``silence as dozens of administrationofficials were indicted and convicted or forced to leave publicservice.''   ``Republicans have been trying to cut Social Security andMedicare for eight years. Until yesterday, they had opposed everyeffort to increase the minimum wage,'' Dukakis said.   ``I don't question their patriotism. I do question theirjudgment _ and their lack of concern for real people.''   Dukakis' speech was interrupted momentarily when supportersbegan chanting to drown out the heckles of a small group ofprotesters. Some of the protesters carried anti-abortion signs, afamiliar scene at Dukakis rallies. Others carried signs that read``Go Home Yankee.''</TEXT></DOC>
