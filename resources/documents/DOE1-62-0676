The effectivenessof the uncouplers in inhibiting oxidative ATP synthesis was evaluatedby measurement of cell ATP levels. Treatment of CHO cells with 1 mM DNPin glucose-free balanced salt solution (BSS), a five-fold higher concentrationthan required to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, produced no substantialheat resistance in the cells heated 3 or 16 hrs later. In contrast, 1.2{mu}M CCCP in BSS, the minimum concentration to achieve effective uncoupling,did produce increased heat resistance in both CHO and V79 cells. Theinduced heat resistance was manifest as a small increase (about 2-fold)in the shoulder (D/sub q/) of the resultant 45{sup 0}C heat survivalcurve, with little change in the D/sub o/. This result contrasts to heat-inducedthermotolerance, which was characterized by a 4-5-fold increase in theD/sub o/ of the resultant 45{sup 0}C survival curve. The data show: (1)transient uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation did not induce thermotolerance,and (2) the increased heat resistance observed with CCCP differed qualitativelyand quantitatively from heat-induced thermotolerance.</TEXT></DOC>
