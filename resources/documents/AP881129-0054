The hostage issue has dominated the state visit of German ForeignMinister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who arrived Sunday.   Genscher has offered to act as a mediator in gaining the releaseof Western hostages, including nine Americans, believed held bypro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists, West German government sourcesin Bonn said.   Genscher met for four hours Monday with Foreign Minister AliAkbar Velayati and held separate discussions with President AliKhamenei and Velayati's deputy, Mohammad Javad Larijani.   Larijani told reporters today that ``there aren't just Americanhostages in Lebanon, but there also are Iranian hostages, who are inthe hands of Christian militiamen.''   He was referring to three Iranians who disappeared with theirLebanese driver in 1982 and were presumed kidnapped by ChristianPhalangist gunmen. The four are widely believed to have died. Nogroup claimed responsibility for their kidnapping.   ``Western nations, especially the United States, have close tiesto (the Phalangists),'' Larijani said. ``We want all hostages to befree, the Iranians as well, and we will work as much as we can sothat they are freed.''   Larijani did not specify what actions Iran might take.   Genscher was to meet again today with Velayati, as well as PrimeMinister Hussein Musavi and Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani.   ``The issue of the hostages remains of the utmost concern tous,'' said a West German official in Tehran who spoke on conditionof anonymity. ``We are ready to do whatever we can to speed theirrelease.''   Genscher's good contacts with Tehran throughout the Iran-Iraq warwere seen as key factors in the release of two West German hostageswho had been held in Lebanon.   Genscher stressed in his talks that freeing the hostages is a``humanitarian question that is independent of nationalities'' andhe ``urged the Iranians to continue their efforts toward ... (their)release,'' said the West German official. He spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Westerners missing in Lebanon are nine Americans, three Britons,an Italian, a Swiss and an Irishman. The longest held is TerryAnderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress. He was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
