<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-44-0231 </DOCNO><TEXT>Through the use of recently available daily volume data on Northwest PipelineCorporation's gathering systems, drawdowns following pressure buildupscan be analyzed to predict flush production behavior of tight gas wellswhich have been shut in due to market restrictions. The &quot;flush&quot; rateas a percentage of the final flowing rate is a function of flowing timefollowing the buildup. The magnitude of the initial &quot;flush&quot; rate is relatedto the length of time the well is shut in, to the final flow rate priorto shut-in, and to the age of the well. The amount of flush productionincreases as the well downtime increases. Daily production historiesof the wells on the Douglas Creek Arch and the Green River, San Juan,Piceance, and Uinta basins were studied. Wells within each area weregrouped by geologic formation, by flow rate, and by similar periods ofshut-in time. When plotted on a log-log scale, the ratio of the post-builduprate to the stable rate shows a straight-line relationship to the drawdowntime. Theoretical curves to predict flow rates following a buildup arepresented. They are based on the superposition of constant pressure solutionsto the flow of a real gas in a porous media and show a nearly straightline rate-time relationship. In light of the current gas surplus andthe evolving spot market, the prediction of accurate short-term performanceis useful in scheduling gas sales and gas transportation.</TEXT></DOC>
