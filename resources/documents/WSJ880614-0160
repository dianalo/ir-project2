McCarthy </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   Perhaps the most heated linguistic battle in the litigation between Ann B. Hopkins and Price Waterhouse is being fought over the use of the term &quot;charm school.&quot;    Noting that Miss Hopkins was &quot;consistently annoying and irritating,&quot; one partner wrote in an evaluation of her that she should take a &quot;course at charm school before she is considered for admission&quot; into the ranks of the firm's partners.    Miss Hopkins claimed that the term is blatantly sexist. Price Waterhouse countered that it's neutral, because charm is a quality admired in both men and women (an argument that the appeals court, in its majority opinion, said &quot;borders on the facetious&quot;).    Out came the dictionaries. The appeals court majority said &quot;charm school&quot; is a somewhat derogatory colloquialism for &quot;finishing school.&quot; Consulting Webster's Third New International Dictionary, the court found that &quot;finishing school&quot; is defined as &quot;a private school that prepares young women for social life (as by emphasizing cultural accomplishments and social graces) rather than for a vocational or professional career.&quot; The court said that the term is sexist.    But the debate didn't end there. In its petition to the Supreme Court, Price Waterhouse points out that Webster's elsewhere defines &quot;charm school&quot; as &quot;a school in which social graces are taught&quot;a description the lawyers contend is sex neutral.    Judge Stephen F. Williams, the dissenter in the 2-1 appeals court decision, called the charm school remark in the evaluation of Miss Hopkins &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;facetious&quot; but not discriminatory. Some phrases have gradually lost their link to sex, he wrote. Judge Williams reasoned that &quot;doll&quot; was originally defined as slang for &quot;a conventionally pretty and shapely young woman . . . whose function is to elevate the status of a male and to inspire general lust.&quot; However, he pointed out, the word has since come to mean any &quot;notably decent, pleasant, generous person,&quot; as in, &quot;Isn't he a doll?&quot;    The judge concluded that language evolves in this way, especially in a lively, spontaneous culture. &quot;Thus,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the phrase 'BS' clearly relies on no distinction between cows and bulls.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
