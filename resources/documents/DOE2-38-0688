Coherence factor in the assumption thatdistributions of single charges do not correlate with each other andthat charge distribution is such that only one charge may be presentin the vicinity of the given point , is found. It is shown that at N-andgt;{infinity}the radiation intensity tends to the final limit.</TEXT></DOC>
