Niagara Mohawk proposes toconstruct an extension of its distribution system between Watertown, NewYork, and TransCadada's facilities at the international border near Gananoque,Ontario, at which point the gas would enter the U.S. Niagara Mohawk hasapplied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for a PresidentialPermit (Docket No. CP89-1571-000) for the extension.The application is filed under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act and DOEDelegation Order Nos. 0204-111 and 0204-127.

The gas would be transported inthe United States over a 27.4 mile extension of Niagara Mohawk's distributionsystem (Trans York Extension) that would connect with TransCanada's facilitiesnear Gananoque, Ontario. In the event the Trans York Extension is not certificated,the agreement contemplates alternate deliveries from TransCanada on a best-effortsbasis at the Niagara or Iroquois delivery points.TransCanada would be obligated to deliver 51,000 Mcf per day on a firmbasis, an annual contract quantity equal to the sum of the daily quantities,and a 15-year quantity of 279,225 MMcf. Niagara Mohawk would not be obligatedto take or pay for any volume of gas; TransCanada's sole remedy, in theevent Niagara Mohawk purchases less than a portion of the annual contractquantity, for a two-year period, is an option to reduce permanently itsfuture obligation to deliver the daily contract quantity. In addition tothe firm volumes, Niagara Mohawk may purchase excess gas to the extentit is available. The Trans York Extension would have adequate capacityto deliver up to 105,000 Mcf per day of excess gas.Niagara Mohawk will pay for firm volumes of gas in accordance with a two-part,demand/commodity rate structure. Under the proposed contract, the demandcharge, separately determined for each month, is calculated by multiplyingthe sum of the daily contract quantities in effect for the month by thedemand charge rate (DCR). The DCR is the sum of the monthly demand tollper Mcf on TransCanada's system, the demand charge per Mcf billed to TransCanadaby NOVA Corporation of Alberta, and a fixed administrative charge of $1.53per Mcf.The proposed contract sets the commodity charge for firm sales at a levelcompetitive with Niagara Mohawk's other long-term firm gas supplies. Thecommodity charge is calculated by subtracting the daily amount of the monthlydemand charge from the adjusted base price. The adjusted base price isdetermined each month by multiplying the base price by a fraction, thenumerator of which is the current weighted average 100 percent load factorrate under Niagara Mohawk's other long-term firm supply contracts, andthe denominator of which is $3.1516, CNG Transmission Corporation's 100percent load factor rate on September 15, 1988. The base price providedin the agreement is $2.24 per MMBtu for the first 60 percent of the monthlycontract quantity and $2.19 per MMBtu for the remainder. As of June 1,1989, if the gas were flowing, the 100 percent load factor price wouldhave been $2.3749. The parties may also agree on a price that is lowerthan the contract price. The proposed contract provides for price renegotiationand arbitration if the price differs substantially from the parties' expectationsat the time of negotiations. The price for excess gas volumes will be negotiatedby Niagara Mohawk and TransCanada. In support of its application, Niagara Mohawk states that the agreementensures that TransCanada's price will remain competitive with and comparableto the prices of major competing natural gas supply sources in the marketserved by Niagara Mohawk, and will enhance its ability to meet system requirements.Niagara Mohawk notes that it is now served directly by only one interstatepipeline and the proposed import would provide it with an additional sourceof firm, secure, long-term supplies. In addition, Niagara Mohawk projectsthat its arrangement with TransCanada will reduce customer gas costs byapproximately five percent. The decision on this application will be made consistent with the DOE'sgas import policy guidelines, under which the competitiveness of an importarrangement in the markets served is the primary consideration in determiningwhether it is in the public interest (49 FR 6684, February 22, 1984). Othermatters that may be considered in making a public interest determinationinclude need for gas and security of the long-term supply. Parties thatmay oppose this application should comment in their responses on the issueof competitiveness and need for the gas as set forth in the policy guidelines.The applicant asserts that this import arrangement is in the public interestbecause it is competitive and its gas source will be secure. Parties opposingthe arrangement bear the burden of overcoming this assertion. <ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Compliance</ITAG>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>), requires the DOE to give appropriate consideration tothe environmental effects of its proposed actions. The FERC is currentlyperforming an environmental review of the impacts of constructing and operatingthe proposed facilities related to this project. The DOE will independentlyreview the results of the FERC environmental evaluation of this projectin the course of making its own environmental determination. No final decisionwill be issued in DOE's proceeding until the DOE has met its obligationunder NEPA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable, and written comments. Any personwishing to become a party to the proceeding and to have the written commentsconsidered as the basis for any decision on the application must, however,file a motion to intervene or notice of intervention, as applicable.
