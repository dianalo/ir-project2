(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Five days before Christmas in 1974,5-year-old Joanna Pierce went to stay with her father for what sheand her mother thought would be a weekend visit.   Instead, her father took her to Europe, where he kept her hiddenfor the next 10 years.   Joanna's mother, Gloria Yerkovich, spent $40,000 searching forher daughter, appeared on network television and argued withofficials from her hometown of Poughkeepsie all the way toWashington, D.C.   In the process, she founded Child Find Inc., an internationalnetwork that has tracked down hundreds of missing children.Yerkovich said she started the organization as a last resort whenshe couldn't break through the legal roadblocks that existed inparental abductions _ and when her loans dried up.   Yerkovich and her daughter were reunited in 1984 after the girl'sfather, Franklin Pierce, agreed to return if a felony charge ofcustodial interference against him was dropped.   ``He did not want to subject his daughter to a life of runningany more,'' said David Cohen, Pierce's attorney.   The homecoming didn't last long. Within a week, Joanna moved toFlorida to live with her father, with whom she remains.   But now all three are in federal court in Albany, where Yerkovichsued Pierce for $5.7 million, for abducting their daughter.   Yerkovich hopes the lawsuit will help mother and daughter starttalking again, said her lawyer, Nick Lyman. ``Since 1974, she hasnever had an open channel of communication with her daughter.''   Pierce and Yerkovich were never married but he had obtained aFamily Court order granting him alternate weekend visits with hischild. Joanna vanished during the first court-ordered overnightvisit.   Pierce, now 70, has admitted he took Joanna, but said he did soto save her a life of torment with her mother and stepfather,Raymond Yerkovich, an elementary school principal from Kingston whomGloria married in 1973.   Joanna, testifying on behalf of her father, has said that hermother struck her repeatedly and that her stepfather fondled her.   The Yerkoviches have refused to respond to the charges.   Authorities say parental abduction has increased in proportionwith the escalating rate of divorce in the United States.   But Yerkovich said that during her search for her daughter shewas horrified to learn that while there was a national computernetwork for stolen cars, there was none for missing children.Embittered and broke, she began laying the groundwork for Child Find.   The group compiled a pictorial directory of missing children fordistribution to schools and established a toll-free number forpeople who spotted children in the directory.   Four years later the group became the target of a stateinvestigation into allegations of financial irregularities andtaking kickbacks from investigators. The investigation found noevidence to support charges of serious wrongdoing, but the agencyagreed to change promotional material and practices and offerrefunds.   While the group helped find hundreds of missing children, Joannawas not one of them.   Yerkovich said Pierce, a former Dow Chemical Co. chemist wholater started his own business, was wealthy and able to move himselfand his daughter around easily.   During testimony last week, Yerkovich burst into tears when sherecalled the evening of Dec. 20, 1974, the last day she saw Joannafor 10 years.   ``I cried and sometimes I screamed. I would turn on the showerand hope the water would drown out my screams. I would scream in thecar when no one could hear me,'' she said.   But Joanna, now 20, testified that her stepfather drank a lot andthat there was a lot of violence between her mother and stepfather.She said she was struck almost daily and once was knockedunconscious after being hurled against a wall.   She also claimed her stepfather fondled her. ``He put his handsall over my body. I despised him,'' she said.   Joanna described an open and caring relationship with her father.She said she never missed her mother.   Yerkovich contends in her suit that Joanna was brainwashed by herfather and that he showed little interest in her until the abduction.   Lyman said he'll show that Franklin Pierce took ``a loving girland turned her into a monster against her mother.''   ``I saw the statements of two doctors,'' Lyman said, ``includingone hired by her father, which show she was clearly not abused. Herlife, as she knows it, is a lie.''   Joanna tearfully disputed that.   ``I don't want to remember, but you remember things,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
