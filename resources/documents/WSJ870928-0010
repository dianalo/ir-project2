Castle also said it will assume about $24 million of debt associated with the properties to be acquired from Apache, a Denver-based oil and gas concern.    Earlier last week, Castle agreed to pay a unit of Tenneco Inc. about $220 million for operations that include 20,000 acres of California farmland, food processing capacity and retail nut stores. Castle, a holding concern that also develops real estate, would assume about $16 million of debt in that purchase.    The Dole unit, which Castle describes as the world's largest processor of fresh fruits and vegetables, would add olives and figs to its produce line with the purchase from Apache. Completing the Tenneco transaction would add almonds, pistachio nuts, table grapes, raisins, cherries and strawberries to the bananas, pineapples, lettuce and more than two dozen other food items currently produced by Dole.    Dole has said that it expects its revenue to exceed $2 billion this year, compared with $1.68 billion last year. In 1986, net income for all of Castle was $43.9 million, or $1.28 a share, including a loss from discontinued operations of $31.7 million. Revenue was $1.74 billion.    Castle Chairman David H. Murdock, who has said the company is continuing to study farmland purchases in California, said the additions are part of a &quot;focus on the international expansion of its food operations.&quot; The company is &quot;particularly interested in marketing our American-grown products in world-wide markets,&quot; he said. The company estimated that Dole would derive more than $800 million of its annual revenue, after the latest two acquisitions, from Europe and Pacific Basin areas outside the U.S.    Castle hasn't yet decided which new produce items would carry the Dole brand name and which would continue to use the names established by prior owners.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Castle shares closed at $24.375, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
