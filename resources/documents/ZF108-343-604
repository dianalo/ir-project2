(CTI), and is expected to find its wayinto the office-automation systems of vendors such as IBM, Digital EquipmentCorp. (DEC) and Data General Corp.andM;Work-flow automation software includes tools that let users create customnetwork applications, according to industry observers and developers who workwith the technology.andP;  Once written, these applications can harness thecapabilities of messaging programs and automatically send information amongother desktop or network applications and users, they said.andM;&quot;This class of systems will allow the network to manage work flow,&quot; saidMichael Howard, president of Infonetics Research Institute Inc., amarket-research firm in San Jose, Calif.andM;For example, Rhapsody Workflow Automation System will let users designapplications that gather and distribute data among Windows-based Rhapsodyapplications, officials from the Morristown, N.J., company said.andM;Rhapsody, which works with ATandamp;T's Unix LAN Manager network, is due forrelease in the third quarter, and will be priced at approximately $8,500 peruser for all software, hardware and networking products.andM;CTI's forthcoming Together program, which the company first sketched out morethan two years ago, is designed for OS/2 LAN Manager-based networks and willlet users create custom software to orchestrate communications among OS/2Presentation Manager-based workstation applications, according to officialsfrom the Trumbull, Conn., company.andP;  The software is due in June, but pricinghas not yet been set.andM;Through work-flow automation, &quot;managers can automate tasks and get rid of thebackground noise that's created as a result of coordinating those tasks,&quot;said Ron Quinn, vice president of CTI.andP;  &quot;They can rely on electroniccommunications to perform some tasks [often performed by middle managers] toimprove communications between senior and lower management.&quot;andM;While ATandamp;T and CTI are two of the first vendors to tap into automatedwork-flow technology, they certainly will not be the last, industry observerssaid.andM;&quot;I'm sure we will see future versions of OfficeVision, All-In-1 and CEOOffice include these capabilities,&quot; said Howard.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
