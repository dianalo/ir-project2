A 60-year-old woman was admitted to ourhospital after complaining of headaches for 5 years and of dizzinessfor 1 week. The results of physical and neurological examinations werenormal. An X-ray of the skull revealed an intracranial calcificationin the left frontal region. CT disclosed calcification and a large low-densityarea in the left parasellar region and the frontal lobe. The mass consistedof two different areas of density. There were multiple, isolated, low-densityspots in the left Sylvian fissure and the interpeduncular cistern. Noabnormal enhancement was seen by CECT. Angiograms showed an elevationof the A/sub 1/ portion of ACA and a lateral shift of MCA. A left fronto-temporalcraniotomy was performed. Chronic or past leptomeningitis was suspectedbecause of the arachnoid-membrane thickening. Multiple fatty globuleswere present in the left Sylvian fissure. A large, soft, fatty tumorwas completely removed. The histologic diagnosis was a dermoid cyst.After this operation, the headaches and dizziness were reduced. It isunclear whether the headaches were caused by the compression of the tumoror by the meningeal irritation of the fatty debris. According to thefindings on the arachnoid membrane, however, it seems likely that fattydebris detached from the tumor spilled out intermittently from the cystinto the subarachnoid space, resulting in meningeal irritation.</TEXT></DOC>
