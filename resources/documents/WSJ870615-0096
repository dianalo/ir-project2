The mark had been held by its 727 trijets, of which 1,831 were sold before that program ended three years ago.    Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. said International Lease Finance Corp., Beverly Hills, Calif., ordered seven 737-300s and five longer-fuselage 737-400 models, three 747s, two 757s and one 767 for a total of $860 million. Boeing Commercial said the other orders came from Air Europe, the airline subsidiary of London-based International Leisure Group, and from Dallas-based Southwest Airlines.    International Lease Finance, which owns and leases commercial aircraft to airlines, previously had said it would place the major order with Boeing, although specific numbers of aircraft involved weren't discussed.    Air Europe ordered five 757s, five 737-400s and two 737-300s, Boeing Commercial said. It said Southwest ordered a 737-300.    The unit of Seattle-based Boeing, a defense contractor and commercial aircraft producer, said it now has taken orders for 1,842 of the 737s, aircraft that entered service in 1968.    International Lease's 737-300s will begin being delivered in January 1988, with its 737-400s scheduled for delivery beginning in January 1990. Its 747-300 models will be delivered in April and May 1988 and the 757-200 models in March and December 1988. The 767-200 extended-range aircraft it ordered will be delivered in October 1988, Boeing said.    Air Europe's 757s will be delivered between March and July 1988, and the 737300s, to be shipped in March of that year, will be followed by the 737-400s in the spring of 1989. Southwest's 737-300 model is schedueld for delivery in May 1989.    A Boeing Commercial spokesman said the company has taken orders this year for 194 airplanes valued at about $9.9 billion. At this time last year, customers had ordered 149 aircraft valued at $8.9 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
