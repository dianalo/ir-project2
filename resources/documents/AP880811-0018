The admission came Wednesday as the service replied to thelatest criticism from Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the HouseArmed Services Committee and one of Congress' leading critics ofthe bomber.   The problem concerns the B-1B's electronic counter-measures,which is the complex computer-driven system designed to help thelong-range atomic bomber outwit Soviet air defenses.   By June, the Air Force said, the service ``determined that workwas behind schedule and the solutions being pursued would notprovide for the full ECM system maturity the Air Force desired.''   While some ECM problems have been fixed, ``progress has not beensatisfactory and the management of the ECM system has not met ourexpectations. We are currently working out the most appropriateaction in the face of those facts,'' the Air Force said in astatement.   Aspin renewed his criticism, this time in a letter to DefenseSecretary Frank C. Carlucci and a speech he planned to delivertoday on the House floor.   There are ``major questions about the B-1B's future,'' he said.``Is it really worth it to spend any more money on the B-1B?   ``We have a very serious problem on our hands,'' said Aspin.``If a case cannot be made for the B-1B, I do not see how we canspend any more money on it.''   The Rockwell-built bomber was killed by President Carter in1977, but President Reagan reversed that decision four years laterand approved the purchase of 100 of the planes for $27.3 billion.All 100 planes have been built.   Reagan said the B-1 was needed to replace the aging B-52s in thenation's long-range bomber arsenal until the ``stealth'' bomberbecomes available. That plane, named after its intended capabilityto evade enemy radar, will be rolled out publicly for the firsttime in November.   In the past two years, the B-1 has run into a series of highlypublicized problems. The Air Force said many of those problems werethe sort normally found in new planes.   But solving the ECM problem is not so easy, the service admitted.   Aspin asked Carlucci to tell Congress how much it will cost toimprove the B-1B, whether the additional money will provideadditional capability, and how the plane's mission can be changedif the money isn't spent.   Unless the questions are answered, said Aspin, ``We may well befaced with the prospect of parking the B-1B.''   He suggested that perhaps the money which would be used for theplane could be used better for other long-range atomic weapons,such as land-based nuclear missiles.   From now until 2004, the United States will spend a projectedtotal of $425 billion for strategic weapons, and $242 billion ofthat total, or 57 percent, will go for bombers, he said.   ``We need to ask ourselves if this money would not be betterspent on systems that do not have as many uncertainties as the B-1Bprogram,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
