The House approved the measure 253-159.   It now goes to the Senate which could take it up as early asnext week, although it is not clear when it will do so.   The technical-corrections resolution amends the 1,000-page tradebill passed last week. The resolution itself would not go to thepresident's desk, but merely instruct a clerk to delete the Alaskaprovisions before the trade bill is sent to the White House.   Republicans complained that reopening the trade bill after italready had been passed was a violation of House rules.   ``You've come the wrong half and you've done it the wrong way,''said Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn. ``When it's over, it's over.''   President Reagan has been expressing concern about a provisionof the trade bill that would require companies with 100 or moreemployees to give 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scalelayoffs.   Democrats said they wanted to compromise but ruled out deletingthe plant-closings provision. They said it was needed byblue-collar workers whose lives are disrupted when they findthemselves out of work without warning.   ``Maybe they should consult their astrologer to find out whenthey are going to be out of work,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.   More recently, the president has been critical of the Alaska oilprovisions.   One of the Alaska provisions would clear the way for export of50,000 barrels of crude daily to Canada, but first require shipmentof the oil in an American vessel to a U.S. West Coast port.   It is a favorite feature of politically influential maritimeunions and a similar provision appears in the U.S.-Canada freetrade agreement signed by Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroneyin January.   The other provision would permit export of 70,000 barrels dailyof petroleum products from the refinery at Valdez, Alaska, and anynew refineries that are constructed in the state.   Republicans have been complaining that it violates acceptedprocedures to reach back and alter the bill after floor action iscomplete. But Wright said bills have gotten similar handling atleast five times in the last three years and that it falls withinproper bounds.   ``Now we again call upon President Reagan to demonstratereciprocal good faith and reconsider his oft-repeated threat toveto the trade bill because of the socially responsible provisionregarding worker notification,'' he said.   Wright acknowledged that dropping the Alaska provisions waspartly aimed at picking up two votes in the Senate for a possibleveto override.   The measure cleared the Senate, 63-36, last week _ short of thetwo-thirds margin needed to override a veto. Both of Alaska'sRepublican senators, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, opposed thebill.   Critics of administration trade policy said the Alaskans wouldhave supported the bill if the export curbs had been deleted.Stevens, however, said he could not guarantee that he would votefor the measure, even if the restrictions were stripped from it.</TEXT></DOC>
