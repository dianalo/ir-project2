The Senate passed a similar bill last Thursday, but theSenate version includes a provision to establish a NationalEndowment for Children's Educational Television. Theendowment would provide grants for creating and producingeducational shows for children. Differences will have to beworked out with the House before the bill can be sent toPresident Bush.</LP><TEXT>   It's uncertain whether the president would sign such abill. Former President Reagan, citing First Amendmentconcerns, vetoed legislation to cap advertising time duringchildren's shows and to require broadcasters to providecertain amounts of children's programming.   The legislation, which passed the House on a voice vote,requires the Federal Communications Commission to consider abroadcaster's track record on providing educational andinformational children's programming when the broadcaster'slicense comes up for renewal.   While not threatening a veto, the administration said thatevaluating children's programming as part of thelicense-renewal process &quot;raises serious First Amendmentconcerns by permitting the government to deny licenserenewals if a station doesn't carry what the government viewsas adequate programming for children.&quot; The administrationalso said it opposed capping ad time, saying that limitscould hold down revenues and perhaps even defeat the purposeof the bill.   Broadcasters didn't seem to share the Bushadministration's concerns. Instead, they enthusiasticallysupported the measures. &quot;The bill protects children fromovercommercialization in their TV and cable programs, whileacknowledging that advertising is what makes these programspossible,&quot; said James C. May, executive vice president,government relations, for the National Association ofBroadcasters. &quot;It spells out, for the first time in statuteform, broadcasters' public-interest obligations to the childaudience but avoids unnecessary and unconstitutionalprogramming standards.&quot;   The bills would require broadcasters and cable operatorsto limit advertising during children's programming to 10 1/2minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes an hour onweekdays. The FCC could review and modify those caps afterJan. 1, 1993.   Further, the House and Senate legislation directs the FCCto conduct a study of program-length commercials such as&quot;G.I. Joe&quot; and &quot;Thundercats,&quot; with characters that are soldas toys.   The bills don't specify the number of hours thatbroadcasters must devote to children's educational shows butleave the evaluation of quantity and quality of children'sprogramming up to the FCC at license renewal time.   &quot;What's going to make this bill work is that it gives ahook -- to parents, teachers and others who are concernedabout children -- to hang their concerns on,&quot; said PeggyCharren, head of Action for Children's Television Inc. &quot;Webelieve that President Bush -- and Mrs. Bush -- will likeit,&quot; she said.   Ms. Charren, who has been working to improve children's TVfor more than 20 years, said the bill was even more necessaryafter the Reagan-era deregulation at the FCC. &quot;Withderegulation, what got lost was that television has to bemeaningful for children, too,&quot; she said.   Andrew Schwartzman, head of Media Access Project, apublic-interest law firm, also applauded the legislation.&quot;I'm sure it will make a difference in programming because itsends a message that broadcasters must be responsible.Broadcasters should be concerned less with what they can getaway with and more with how they are going to serve thepublic.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
