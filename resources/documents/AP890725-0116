(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Authorities from four states trying to solvefive fatal shootings in the past week are awaiting results ofballistics tests on a gun found after the arrest of a man at aroadblock.   Greg Francis Braun, 28, of Garden City, Kan., was arraignedMonday in Raton on a charge of murder in the shooting Sunday of amini-mart clerk in Springer, about 30 miles south of Raton innorthern New Mexico. He was being held at the Colfax County Jail inlieu of $1 million bond.   Braun was the second person arrested in connection with thestring of slayings. The gun was found in Braun's car, and officialsplanned to conduct ballistics tests today. Results of the tests areexpected Wednesday.   Paul Renfrow, an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigationspokesman in Oklahoma City, said earlier ballistics tests indicatedthat four people slain last week in Garden City, Ardmore, Okla.,and Pampa, Texas, were shot with one gun.   Michael Frank Greene, 37, of Inola, Okla., was charged Sunday inArdmore with first-degree murder. Police did not find a gun onGreene.   Carter County District Attorney Fred Collins, who filed thecharge against Greene, said Monday he didn't want to discuss thecase until he had heard from officers sent to Raton to investigateBraun.   ``This is the most ridiculous headache. It is not simple,''Collins said.   In Raton, Deputy District Attorney Leslie Skinner said there wasno information linking Braun to the killings in Oklahoma, Texas andKansas, and no indication Braun and Greene knew each other.   But Capt. Stan Wojdylak of the Garden City Police Departmentsaid, ``Right now we're not ruling anybody out.'' His departmentalso sent detectives to New Mexico.   ``We just have to see what happens when we talk to the person inNew Mexico. These are probably our two best leads,'' Wojdylak said,referring to Greene and Braun.   Pampa authorities have charged Greene with capital murder in theshooting of a Pampa photo processing business owner, but PampaDeputy Police Chief Kenneth Hall said: ``Just because we made anarrest doesn't mean we're not going to continue ... following up oneach and every lead we can.''   Braun was arrested near Cimarron on Sunday evening, about 40minutes after a holdup at a mini-mart in the nearby town ofSpringer left clerk Geraldine Valdez, 48, dead with two gunshotwounds to the head.   ``Someone called and gave us a description of a vehicle,''Colfax County Sheriff Jim Maldonado said Monday. He said Braunsurrendered peacefully.   Braun stood quietly at his arraignment. A magistrate said apreliminary hearing would be held within 10 days.   Meanwhile in Ardmore, a judge denied bond for Greene and set apreliminary hearing for Sept. 28.   In an interview Sunday with The Daily Oklahoman, Greene'sfather, Hank, said of his son: ``He would give you the shirt offhis back. He's never even had a weapon in his house. He's neverliked them. He was always afraid the kids would get ahold of them.He's never done no physical harm to anyone.''   The killings began early Wednesday in Garden City, when BarbaraKochendorfer, 27, and Mary Rains, 28, were abducted fromconvenience stores on opposite sides of the southwestern Kansascity. Their bodies were found hours later.   On Thursday, Edley Perry Spurrier was found dead in the photoprocessing shop he ran in Pampa, in the Texas Panhandle.   In Ardmore, Gwen Miller was killed in a flower shop Friday, andtwo other women were wounded.   Ardmore Assistant Police Chief David Willingham said one of thesurvivors, Joann Bean, had identified Greene from photographs asthe man who shot her, Mrs. Miller and Mary Manning.   Meanwhile, in Merrillville, Ind., police said the March slayingsof two motel clerks may be related to the killings in Kansas,Oklahoma and Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
