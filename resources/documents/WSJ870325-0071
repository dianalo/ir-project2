Brookes</HL><DD> 03/25/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABOR </IN><TEXT>   For the past two months, organized labor has been running Dickensesque TV commercials that show Americans in the year 2010 clad in dusty scarves and sitting in rockers in dingy attics. The point of this dismal scene is that the future is bleak for U.S. workers.    But is it? Over the past 12 months (February 1986 to February 1987), 2.7 million jobs were created, 41.5% of which were &quot;managerial and professional specialty,&quot; the highest-paid category classified by the Labor Department.    This is the largest year-to-year growth-share for top-paid jobs, and continues a trend over the past four years. From February 1983 to February 1987, the shares of managerial/professional, technical/sales, and precision/production categories all rose. The shares of the service, laborer and farm-worker categories declined. In other words, the Labor Department shows Americans &quot;trading up&quot; in jobs at a fairly steady rate.    Yet, Big Labor has been busy putting out the story that just the opposite is taking place. Worried about the sharp decline in their share of the U.S. work force, the unions have promoted the work of Barry Bluestone of the University of Massachusetts and Bennett Harrison of MIT that supposedly shows an &quot;alarming trend toward low-pay jobs,&quot; using the period from 1979 to 1984 as the key point of assault, and comparing that period with 1973 to 1979.    The Bluestone-Harrison research eventually found its way to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, whose then-chairman, Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.), published it in December.    As it was later learned, the Labor Department had warned Messrs. Bluestone and Harrison back in October that their use of the consumer price index as the &quot;deflator&quot; (to arrive at constant dollar wage brackets) rather than the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index dramatically understated constant-dollar wage scales in the 1979-84 period, and thus overstated their low-pay wage thesis. When the PCE deflator was used, most of the low-pay trend disappeared.    The Labor Department also cautioned them that by selecting the period from 1979 to 1984, they were picking the most extreme possible case that did not reflect the long-term, essentially stable trend. But both these warnings were ignored, and the study was released and has since become part of national economic mythology.    Yet, as the Labor Department's data have repeatedly demonstrated, this whole low-pay jobs thesis is largely a statistical fraud resulting from careful selection of unrepresentative years. As Robert Samuelson, economist and Washington Post and Newsweek columnist, said on Feb. 23: &quot;Welcome to Economics Propaganda 101. The notion that the U.S. economy is producing mostly low-paying, unskilled jobs is an economic fiction.    &quot;Generally speaking, the mix between well-paid and poorly paid work is the same as in the 1970s. Creating the impression that it's otherwise is an exercise in statistical myth-making designed to advance a political agenda.&quot;    In short, it is part of Big Labor's short-sighted strategy to sell the American people the witches' brew of protectionism, tariffs and quotas.    Despite Mr. Samuelson's debunking, the Washington Post gave this &quot;myth-making&quot; still another shot in its Sunday Outlook Section on March 15, where Lance Compa, a lawyer for the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, argued that &quot;44% of the new jobs in the Reagan years paid $7,400 or less.&quot; In order to come up with such a charge, Mr. Compa had to include as &quot;Reagan years&quot; the period from 1979 through 1981, or three Carter fiscal years that also included two recessions, the worst inflation in modern history and a massive 7%, two-year decline (1979-81) in average real wages.    The reason Messrs. Bluestone and Harrison chose the 1979-84 period for their study becomes obvious in an analysis made by congressional staff economist Christopher Frenze for Rep. Dan Lungren (R., Calif.). Mr. Frenze's study uses Bureau of Labor Statistics data to supply the same Bluestone-Harrison breakdown for all years, 1973-85. His analysis shows that between 1973 and 1985, there is almost no change in the basic distribution of jobs by pay classification, even accepting the Bluestone-Harrison data base with its disputed deflator.    When you arrange the data in four-year presidential budget cycles -- 1973-1977 (Nixon-Ford budgets), 1977-1981 (Carter budgets) and 1981-1985 (Reagan budgets) -- a stunning new picture emerges. During the Carter years, of the net new jobs created, 41.7% were in the Bluestone-Harrison low-pay category. At the same time, their high-pay category lost jobs. (See Table.)    Now compare that with the real Reagan years, 1981-1985: In that period, 46.1% of the net new jobs were in the high-wage category. At the same time, only 6% were in the low-wage category, and 1986 raw data suggest this high-wage trend accelerated last year.    What has actually happened is that since 1982 we have been correcting the unusual downward trends associated with the double-digit inflation of 1979 and 1980, and the two back-to-back recessions of 1980 and 1981, all of which apparently had the greatest impact on the high-pay jobs category. In effect, the recovery has focused mainly on bringing those jobs back up to their original 1973 share of the economy.    As Janet Norwood, the nonpartisan commissioner of labor statistics, said in a very carefully understated Feb. 22 article in the New York Times, &quot;the findings {of so-called low-wage jobs studies} are extremely sensitive to the particular set of data used {and} the years chosen for the analysis.&quot;    What is much more troubling about all this statistical flim-flammery is that it is obscuring a much more serious problem in our economy: Since 1982, we apparently have been generating high-pay and high-skill jobs at a much faster rate than we have been training people to fill them.    This is already producing serious and potentially inflationary skilled-labor shortages in many sectors of our economy, even as it leaves out the untrained underclass. Even a perfunctory review of the nation's currently record levels of help-wanted advertising shows a very strong bias toward higher-skilled jobs in both the service and the manufacturing sectors.    By using the phony low-pay jobs thesis to protect old labor-union turf, the nation's liberals are overlooking and undercutting a potentially greater new opportunity for social spending and advocacy: the case for much more education and training for the high-wage economy being created.    ---   Mr. Brookes, an editorialist for the Detroit News, writes a syndicated column.    ---                           NET NEW JOBS                          (in thousands)                    LOW            MIDDLE          HIGH                  (under          ($7,012-       ($28,048                  $7,012)         $28,048)       and over)               number  share   number  share   number  share Nixon-Ford 1973-77       2,550   37.5%   3,490   51.3%    758    11.2% Carter 1977-81       3,837   41.7%   6,277   68.2%   -912    -9.9% Reagan 1981-85         412    6.1%   3,180     47%  3,169    46.9% Bluestone- Harrison 1979-84       4,687   58.0%   3,837   47.5%   -442    -5.5%   Note: Salaries in 1984 constant dollars   Source: Joint Economic Committee   (Revised WSJ March 26, 2987)</TEXT></DOC>
