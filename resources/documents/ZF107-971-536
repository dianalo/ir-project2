from &quot;buy&quot; and cut his 1990 forecast to$4.10 a share from $4.50, said yesterday that while it expects net sales forits first quarter to December 29 to exceed last year's $1,405m, the increasewill be less than it expected, because as in the UK, US consumers just aren'tbuying high-ticket items this Christmas, and as a result, earnings per sharewill likely be down on the $1.10 of a year ago: Apple says Mac sales arestrong overall, with the IICI, IICX and SE30 leading the way, the low-end SEand Plus are below expectations; in addition, there have been problemsramping up the production of the Macintosh Portable to meet demand, due toshortage of screens; ly of the products screen display.andM;- o -andM;Italtel SpA has won agreement with Soviet telecommunications manufacturerKrasnaya Zarya for a joint venture to build the Linea UT digital telephoneexchange in the USSR.andM;- o -andM;Norsk Data A/S, Oslo, Norway has a $7.5m contract to supply a computer-aideddesign and manufacturing system to a Leningrad shipyard - if CoCom allows itto ship the thing.andM;- o -andM;Applications-specific circuit specialist Integrated CMOS Systems Inc,Sunnyvale, California has won a technological collaboration agreement withand cash injection from Toshiba Corp: the aim of the pact is to bring thetechnologies of the two companies closer together to provide their respectivecustomers with a system-oriented ASIC design capability, and Toshiba getsrights to ICS' patented SCAN technology, in return providing the company withprimary access to Toshiba's manufacturing facilities in the US and overseasfor prototype and production wafer fabrication.andM;- o -andM;The Taiwanese government-backed Channel International bid for Wyse TechnologyInc values the company at $268.4m: Wyse reported turnover of $452.3m in theyear to March 31.andM;- o -andM;Nokia Oy's breakneck expansion into electronics via acquisition has left thecompany short of resources for the major investments needed to exploit theopportunities in its three key businesses - cellular telephones andequipment, high-definition television and computer systems - and theconsensus is that one will have to go to raise funds for the other two, withNokia Data much the most likely: if it were to go onto the block, or apartner were sought, all the European majors, led by ICL, Ing C Olivetti andamp; CoSpA, Bull SA and Siemens AG would want to take a close look at what might bea once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to gain a dominant position in theScandinavian computer market; in the new era of vendor-independent standards,acquisitions of companies that are racing down the standards route simplyrepresent market share gained and a competitor eliminated - with, in the caseof Nokia, a substantial presence in the banking terminal business as asweetener; the downside is that further substantial job cuts would likely beneeded at the Swedish factories in any acquisition.andM;- o -andM;No details yet, but Motorola Inc has a new version of the 88000 RISC and cutprices on the exising ones.andM;- o -andM;Londonbased Cellnet Ltd will almost double the capacity of its Midlandscellular network by adding an extra 1,300 voice channels, representing a 10%increase in capacity for the Cellnet system as a whole: by the end of thisweek, Cellnet intends to have brought in 18 new cells and added new extrachannels to 41 existing cells; Cellnet warns that there may be some temporarydisruption to the service in that region this week while the retuning offrequency channels is carried out.andM;- o -andM;Centel Corp is letting 88% of its Federal Systems unit go in a managementbuyout for about $50m: the Reston, Virginia government computer systemsintegrator, was acquired from M/A-Com Inc three years ago.andM;- o -andM;A 3&quot; cooling device that can plunge temperatures to -206oC has been designedfor use in superconductor research by MMR Technologies Inc, in Mountain View,California, reports the Wall Street Journal: it compresses nitrogen to 1,800lbs per square inch and quickly expands it, and costs $1,800; furtherresearch is being done to develop the device so it can freeze computer chips;a prototype can cool an integrated circuit to the temperature of ice waterwhere it works up to 40% faster than at room temperature, but size, cost andreliability problems must be resolved to make the cooling technique practical- MMR hopes to have prototypes of the ready for customer trials in 1990.andM;- o -andM;Things begin to get a little incestuous when companies can win awards forgiving awards, but IBM and DEC are both winners in the Association forBusiness Sponsorship of the Arts-Daily Telegraph awards, DEC getting theCorporate Sponsorship award for putting up more than #1m since 1986 for danceprojects, with 18 new dance works being commissioned this year alone, and IBMsharing the Single Project award for the Leonardo da Vinci Exhibition at theHaywards Gallery last winter.andM;- o -andM;Turnaround specialist Matthew Tutino reckons that his job at Qantel Inc,Hayward, California is done and he is resigning as president and chiefexecutive although he will stay on as chairman: Karl Niemuller is promotedfrom inside the company to be chief executive.andM;- o -andM;As Ernie Harrison tried to deliver the good words from the Racal twins atyesterday's announcement of interims at the Royal Lancaster Hotel yesterday,the cellphones were silenced by a loud burst of applause from the next roomwhich seemed to come in response to his revelation that Racal had only missedthe West German cellular franchise by a whisker and his expression of goodwishes to the Mannesmann consortium - but who was it giving such a goodimpression of a party of lager louts in those salubrious surroundings? Noneother than one of the regular gathering of IBM retirees - but despite anyimpression that may have been given, these ones really were on the wrong sideof 50 - IBM isn't yet making offers of early retirement to its graduateyuppies.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
