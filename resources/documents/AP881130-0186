In a letter to the president-elect, 34 Democrats and RepublicanDave Durenberger of Minnesota urged Bush to make it clear that``such a policy will have no place in your administration.'' Theletter was initiated by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio.   Last year the agency received 5.5 million claims for SocialSecurity, Medicare and welfare benefits, and more than 300,000appeals from its no-benefit rulings. The government lost more thanhalf of the cases that were appealed, according to a draft of theproposal to change the rules on appeals hearings.   Agency spokesman Philip Gambino has described the proposal as anattempt to improve efficiency.   But the senators' letter said the ``astonishingly high'' numberof cases won by people who were denied benefits ``suggests to usthat the Social Security Administration consistently makessystem-wide errors in determining eligibility.''   ``But instead of correcting its mistakes the Social SecurityAdministration is trying to make it harder for claimants to appealthose mistakes,'' said the letter.</TEXT></DOC>
