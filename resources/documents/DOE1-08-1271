The averagearsenic concentration on a whole-coal basis is 14.0 ppm (standard deviation= 14.9). The ranking of the average arsenic concentration by formationis: Kanawha (mean = 5.04 ppm), is less than New River (mean = 10.1 ppm),which is equal to Pochontas (mean = 10.9 ppm), which is equal to Monongahela(mean = 12.4 ppm), and all are less than Allegheny (mean = 18.1 ppm).An analysis of the Upper Freeport coal bed of the Allegheny formationwas undertaken to evaluate the regional (western Pennsylvania) versuslocal (within mine) arsenic variation. The arsenic concentration andvariation are greater on the regional scale (mean = 40.8 ppm with a standarddeviation = 30.6 for n = 21) than within mine (mean = 23.8 ppm with astandard deviation = 18.7 for n = 19). However, samples containing comparablyhigh pyritic sulfur but moderate arsenic contents (andless;9 ppm) show verylittle potential for removal by physical processing. This is attributedto the small size (andless;30 {mu}m and dispersed) of the pyrite.</TEXT></DOC>
