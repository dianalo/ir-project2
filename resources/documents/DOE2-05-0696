Formaldehyde production was improvedtwofold with respect to the initial amount of formaldehyde and 1.61-foldwith respect to the final amount of formaldehyde after a 12-h reactionunder optimized detergent treatment conditions. The treatment causedformaldehyde and formate dehydrogenases to leak out of the cells morerapidly than catalase, but there was no leakage of alcohol oxidase. Theimprovement in formaldehyde production was considered to be due to theincreased permeability of yeast cell membranes and to lower activitiesof formaldehyde and formate dehydrogenases in Cation M2-treated cellsthan in intact cells. Changes in the ultrastructure of the cells wereobserved upon Cation M2 treatment. Several developed peroxisomes wereobserved in intact cells. After Cation M2 treatment, the cells were obviouslydamaged, and several peroxisomes seemed to have fused with each other.</TEXT></DOC>
