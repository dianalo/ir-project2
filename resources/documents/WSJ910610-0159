In the case, the department planned to promote 22 minorityofficers whose exam scores were just slightly lower thanthose of some whites who were passed over. Because thecandidates' scores were within a narrow band, the differenceswere deemed statistically insignificant and race became thedetermining factor.</LP><TEXT>   Judge Robert Peckham accepted the banding approach butsaid other factors, not just race, must be considered in thefinal selection. He based his ruling on the 1978 SupremeCourt decision (University of California Regents vs. Bakke)that attacked racial quotas and on a related 1987 federalappeals case.   This is the third attempt by the city to carry out aconsent decree, arising from a 1973 race discrimination suit,which called for more diversity in senior police departmentpositions. The city spent nearly $1 million and five years todevelop and administer a test that tried to eliminate racialbias. Still, the latest exam didn't yield the racial mixbeing sought by the parties to the suit: promoting minoritiesto equal their proportion on the police force.   &quot;The judge is asking the impossible,&quot; said Duane Reno, anattorney for the San Francisco Police Officers Association.&quot;It's time we accept the results and move on.&quot;   Equally frustrated is Deputy City Attorney George Riley,who says the city now has three choices. It can appeal,revert to the original system that selects candidates basedon test ranking alone, or put together a selection plan thattakes into account qualifications in addition to race.However, he said, all other relevant qualifications weresupposedly measured by the exam.</TEXT></DOC>
