The decision, which followed a tense competition, restores Lockheed as the dominant supplier of sub hunters and for the time being ends Boeing's challenge for that role. The Navy plans to buy 125 of the new planes, for about $39 million each. The total cost of the aircraft project is about $5 billion.    Boeing, eager to gain Navy contracts, bettered Lockheed in the previous major competition, by winning a lucrative contract about two years ago to build an improved avionics system for the current fleet of sub hunters, the P-3.    The new aircraft -- known as the Long-Range Air Anti-Submarine Capability Aircraft -- is derived from the P-3, which Lockheed has made for decades. Analysts said the aerospace company, based in Burbank, Calif., could promise some cost savings because it made the earlier generation.    Meanwhile, Lockheed said the new plane will be able to carry twice the weapons payload of the current P-3s. In addition, the plane will have General Electric Co.'s GE-38 engine, which is designed to save on fuel costs for the Navy.    To begin work on the project, the Navy awarded Lockheed a $200,000 contract for engineering designs. Contracts for further work will be negotiated in coming weeks. The company plans to begin full-scale production of the aircraft in 1992, with the first deliveries to the Navy coming two years later. Under current plans, Lockheed would begin producing the planes at the maximum rate of 18 a year in 1996, and would continue at that level through 2001. However, contractors' production plans are invariably altered as a result of technical problems or year-to-year budget adjustments.    Among other defense contracts announced by the Pentagon, United Technologies Corp. received a $61.2 million Air Force contract for jet engine improvements.    Boeing won a $52.4 million Air Force contract for Minuteman missile equipment.    Ingalls Shipbuilding, a unit of Litton Industries Inc., received a $29.8 million Navy contract for destroyer services.    Southwest Marine Inc. won a $19.6 million Navy contract for destroyer overhaul.    Hayes International Corp. was awarded a $14.1 million Air Force contract for aircraft maintenance.    Allied Petroleum Inc. received a $10.9 million Defense Logistics Agency contract for fuel. </TEXT></DOC>
