(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four mornings a week, without a wordor glance, Mario Haro and Alejandra Arellano Munoz exchange a2{-year-old girl who has become a symbol in the controversy oversurrogate motherhood.   Critics point to their case as an example of how Third Worldmothers can be exploited as breeders for people from affluentcountries.   Ms. Arellano Munoz, 22, a single mother of three from a smalltown near Mazatlan, Mexico, and Haro's wife, Nattie, are cousins.When the Haros couldn't conceive a child they brought her cousinfrom Mexico to help them.   Arellano Munoz, impregnated artificially with Haro's sperm, saysshe believed she would carry the embryo just three weeks and then itwould be transplanted to Mrs. Haro.   When she found out otherwise, she vowed to keep the child, LydiaMichelle. A handwritten surrogacy contract paying $1,500 _ far belowthe market $10,000 surrogacy payment _ was discredited. A judgeawarded joint custody.   `It's only a matter of time before we start crossing more bordersand start hiring Third World breeders for families in thiscountry,'' said Matt Pawa, legislative liaison for the NationalCoalition Against Surrogacy, a Washington-based advocacy group thathas followed the case.   The Haros, also born in Mexico, live in a four-bedroom house inChula Vista. He is a 35-year-old teacher; she is a former bankemployee.   ``I think their (the Haros') position has been that they havemore money, they're more educated, and therefore they have betterparenting skills,'' said lawyer Harvey E. Berman, who representedArellano Munoz in court last year. ``Fortunately, we don't rateparents' abilities by how much money they have.''   Arellano Munoz, a former cleaning woman, has a third-gradeeducation. She supports her two other children with $50 a month fromthe Haros and charitable gifts. She shares an apartment here withseveral other women.   Another court hearing is scheduled after Lydia's third birthdayin July to determine her immediate future.   ``I think she (Lydia) needs to be in a stable home, not boundingaround,'' said Mrs. Haro, 38, who has a 20-year-old daughter from aprevious marriage. ``I wish that she would just give us custody. ...She has two other children to keep her occupied.''   Arellano Munoz declined to be interviewed. In an interview lastyear, she complained: ``I am ignored as ... the mother.''   ``They would like her to disappear,'' said Gena Corea, a Bostonauthor and critic of surrogate motherhood. ``She was supposed to bea breeder, a package that would just deliver this baby anddisappear. So it's really inconvenient that there's this human beinghere.''</TEXT></DOC>
