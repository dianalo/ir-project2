She said the decision was made among union leadersSunday night, but it was not directly related to the strike that hasall but shut down Eastern Airlines since March 4.   Meanwhile, Donald Trump said today he is no longer willing to payhis prior offer, $365 million, for Eastern's profitable East Coastshuttle, because of the labor troubles at Continental's sisterairline. And Eastern began efforts to hire new pilots to replace theones who have walked out.   As the Continental strike deadline came at 10 a.m. EST, someflight attendants set up picket lines at the carrier's main Houstonhub, but flights appeared to be departing and arriving normally.   There are about 6,800 Continental flight attendants; the companyand union give differing figures on how many are union members inthe largely ununionized carrier.   ``It's like an annual event,'' Continental spokesman Dave Messingsaid. An Easter 1988 call for a sickout failed to materialize, and``there's no reason to believe this attempt will be any moresuccessful,'' he said.   About 10 members of the Union of Flight Attendants, dressed inmaroon uniforms with Continental emblems, walked a picket line atHouston Intercontinental Airport, carrying yellow signs proclaiming``On Strike.''   ``We were prepared to strike in December and we were promised atthe time that if we waited the company would be willing to sit downand negotiate a contract with us in January, but that still has nothappened,'' Sheila Hammond, one of the pickets, said.   There were also pickets reported at Newark (N.J.) InternationalAirport and Denver's Stapleton International Airport, two othermajor Continental airports.   It was not immediately clear how many flight attendants walkedoff their jobs and how many were picketing on their days off.   There were no immediate reports of problems at airports affectedby the picketing, or at other airports. Many airports requirewould-be pickets to seek permission in advance.   ``We don't see any evidence of that at this point,'' said RichardBoulware, public affairs director for Denver's StapletonInternational Airport. ``We have not received any requests forpermission to demonstrate or picket by the flight attendants.''   Continental said in a statement that the flights were runningnormally, ``which shows that our flight attendants are proud oftheir service and will continue to support the company's goal ofproviding for the customer.''   The company says that only about 5 percent of its flightattendants are actually dues-paying members of the attendants union,which is the only union at the airline since 1983. The union saysthat more than 60 percent of the attendants are members.   Continental's flight attendants voted in December to authorize astrike over wages and have been free to walk out since that time,union president Carla Winkler said Sunday.   Messing said the company had reserve attendants it could call inif the walkout became significant. He said Continental operatesabout 1,400 flights daily serving 120 cities in the United Statesand numerous foreign countries.   Continental's flight attendants, although represented by a union,have been operating without a collective bargaining agreement sinceSeptember 1983, when Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp.,Continental into bankruptcy and abrogated his union contracts. TexasAir is the parent company of both Eastern and Continental.   Winkler said she hoped a Continental walkout would make it clearto travelers and government officials that ``the problem withLorenzo isn't just at Eastern.''   Eastern, meanwhile, announced this weekend a campaign to hirepilots to replace those who have refused to cross the picket lines.   The union for the 3,600 pilots who have honored the Machinists'strike since it began March 4 said it will go to U.S. BankruptcyCourt in New York to fight the plan. The airline filed for protectiounder the bankruptcy laws five days after the strike began.   ``All transactions outside the normal course of business need(the judge's) approval,'' said Air Line Pilots Association attorneyJames Linsey. ``Hiring a new work force is certainly not in thenormal course of business.''   Only about 200 Eastern pilots, most of them management, areflying, and Eastern is operating less than 10 percent of itspre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights. Most of thestill-operating flights are on the shuttle service between Boston,Washington and New York, which Eastern has been trying to sell toTrump.   In a letter to Lorenzo disclosed today, Trump said he wouldn'tpay $365 million for the shuttle because it ``has become an entirelydifferent business in that its market share and customer base may belost for some time to come, if not forever.''   ``Today, the business is worth considerably less than the pricenegotiated last fall,'' the multimillionaire real estate developersaid.   Eastern has said that increasing the number of pilots is the keyto its survival.   ``We need pilots to start rebuilding,'' Eastern spokesman RobinMatell said Sunday. ``We've waited patiently for the pilots' unionto come to its senses.''   A union spokesman, J.B. Stokes, said he doubted Eastern wouldfind many applicants because of an industrywide pilot shortage.   ``They want to test the marketplace, and they also want to try tofrighten our pilots into thinking they're being replaced. Theyshould have learned by now that intimidation isn't going to work,''Stokes said.</TEXT></DOC>
