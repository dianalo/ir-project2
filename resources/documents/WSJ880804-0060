Textron, an aerospace technology, commercial products and financial services concern, said the agreement is expected to lead to a contract with a total value of more than $500 million through 1995 if 600 Airbus aircraft are sold. The Airbus aircraft is marketed by Airbus Industrie, a consortium of European airplane makers.    In May, Textron reached an agreement with British Aerospace PLC to make part of the wing structure of the Airbus. That contract is valued at as much as $700 million through 1995.    Textron said that under the agreement with Messerschmitt, its Textron Aerostructures unit will make flaps, spoilers and related parts for the Airbus A-330 and A-340. Spoilers, located on the trailing edges of wings, are used as air brakes during landing.    Textron said it will share the risk with Messerschmitt for losses that could be incurred if not enough aircraft are sold. Textron also said it will invest $3 million in equipment to make wing parts.    Delivery of the parts is scheduled to begin in early 1991, Textron said. The company said it will have as many as 200 workers employed on the project at the expected peak of production in 1993-95. </TEXT></DOC>
