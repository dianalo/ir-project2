Researchers found evidence that large cold-blooded animals cankeep constant high body temperatures by large body size, lowmetabolic rate and the use of some peripheral tissues as insulation.   The study focused on leatherback turtles, which are among thelargest living reptiles. They can weigh more than 1,500 pounds.   The turtles range from the tropics to near the Arctic circle.They can warm up on land and keep elevated body temperatures incold seawater, researchers said.   Scientists measured metabolic rates of six adult females andmathematically analyzed the turtles' ability to maintain arelatively high internal temperature.   Leatherbacks may restrict the flow of blood to the skin to keepwarm and increase it to avoid overheating, researchers said.Support for that idea comes in the observation that the turtles'soft skin appears to be flushed with blood while the animal nests,the researchers said.   The scientists suggested that their proposedtemperature-regulating system for large animals be called``gigantothermy.''   Such a system may have allowed dinosaurs to live in a widevariety of habitats, including polar regions, the researchers said.   The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British journalNature by scientists from Drexel University in Philadelphia andPurdue University in Fort Wayne, Ind.</TEXT></DOC>
