Like the four-minute mile, a one-time barrier that has been leftin the dust by a generation of faster runners, the $20 billion markappeared to be a stepping stone on the path to even bigger deals.   But in the wake of tough questions about the financing of thesetransactions, the new benchmark is looking more like Bob Beamon's1968 long jump _ an elusive record that may not be broken for yearsto come.   Some attributed Beamon's astounding jump, which remains one ofthe oldest records in track and field, to the rarified air of MexicoCity. The environment on Wall Street seemed similarly primed a fewweeks ago, when the first of more than $40 billion in new takeovers,buyouts and restructurings was announced.   ``The acquisition business seemed to have mushroomed to some sortof emotional and financial extreme,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vicepresident at First Albany Corp.   The succession of deal announcements came at rapid-fire pace:Grand Metropolitan PLC surprised Pillsbury Co. with a $5.2 billionbid; Philip Morris Cos. Inc. offered $11 billion for Kraft Inc.;Kraft responded with a $13.6 billion restructuring; RJR Nabiscomanagers said they were considering going private in a $17 billiondeal; Kohlberg Kravis countered with its unprecedented tender offer;Farley Inc. bid $1.4 billion for textile giant West Point-PepperellInc., among others.   ``Not only did we get a lot of deals, but they were big deals,''Johnson said. Yet when investors and observers started focusing onthe business ramifications of these huge transactions, ``everybodycame away with an uncomfortable feeling,'' he added.   Indeed, ``some of the bigger deals are being looked at morecarefully and critically,'' said Joseph Bartlett, a partner in thelaw firm Gaston andamp; Snow who served as undersecretary of commerce inthe Johnson administration.   Adding to concerns about the high _ and potentially dangerous _levels of debt needed to support these buyouts, were words ofwarning from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who cautionedbanks to exercise discretion in granting loans to dealmakers forfear a recession could turn megadeals into megadefaults.   Further, the delay of the sale of $1.15 billion in junk bondsneeded to finance Campeau Corp.'s huge takeover of FederatedDepartment Stores Inc. served as an indication that ``this is not aperpetual-motion machine,'' Bartlett said.   If Canadian investor Robert Campeau ``has bitten off more than hecan chew, maybe these deals are not so easy to do,'' he added.   It was not long before investors began to focus on the darkerside of the takeover scene. They began to realize that even if someof the deals could be pulled off, the resulting companies would beawash in debt.   ``The dependence on debt has ... led us to recognize the warningthat this might not be healthy for corporate America,'' Johnsonsaid, pointing to the fact that while Nabisco stock initially roseon the takeover talk, the price of its bonds plunged.   Later in the week, mounting fears sent the prices of takeoverstocks sharply lower, and the stocks of companies rumored to bepotential buyout targets fell in tandem. Several issues recoveredsome of the lost ground on Friday.   The crisis will come if buyers don't materialize for thehigh-yield, high-risk junk bonds used to finance the deals or if theleveraged companies are unable to sell off some unneeded assets topay down their debts.   Among those immediately affected would be banks, particularlythose that made what they thought were short-term loans to tide thecompanies over until bonds or assets could be sold.   No one knows what exactly triggered the feeding frenzy in thefirst place. But Bartlett suspects the upcoming election is playingat least a supporting role.   ``There's a shiver in the market ... that either Bush or Dukakis,once in office, will tighten up on the regulation of the securitiesmarkets and make (takeovers) more difficult from a tax standpoint,''he said, referring to the outcome of the presidential election.   Bartlett noted that the government essentially finances more thana third of the cost of leveraged buyouts by allowing interestdeductions on the debt. That's a loophole he said would be easy toclose.   ``You could say if a company is too highly leveraged, then onlyhalf the interest is deductible,'' for example.   Many argue that the participants in these deals _ from those whoreap huge fees issuing junk bonds or loans to those who purchase thedebt _ are ultra-savvy investors who know what they're getting into.That doesn't lessen the risks, however.   Johnson thinks recent events will prove to be a watershed for thebuyout business. Not only does he think takeover activity willsubside as investors continue to focus on the financial fragility ofthese deals, but he called $20 billion ``a benchmark that won't bebroken for some time.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
