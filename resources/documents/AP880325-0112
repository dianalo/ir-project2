National Education Association President Mary Hatwood Futrellsaid she will ask her state affiliates to work with governors,state legislators and state school officials to bring about suchexperiments on a broad scale.   She told a news conference that teachers, parents and others inthe experimental districts would have the union's blessings to``turn their school systems upside down or inside out'' in pursuitof improvements.   In response, Secretary of Education William J. Bennett said in astatement:   ``It's rather ironic to hear a call for reform from theorganization that has done the most to resist meaningful educationreforms in recent years. But if they are serious, it will be awelcome and refreshing change to have NEA begin supporting realeducation reform.''   Each state should have at least one district operating ``as anexperimental, living laboratory for education reform,'' Futrellsaid.   ``In these 50 school districts, school employees, workingthrough their local association, would join with school boards,parents, civic leaders and business to develop whatever innovativeor creative program they deem appropriate to improve education,''she said.   ``Those 50 local communities would be free to turn their schoolsystems upside down or inside out,'' she said.   ``They would be free to open their school doors to 4-year-olds,or end the arbitrary division of class periods into 50-minutechunks, or experiment with alternatives to student tracking,'' shesaid.   Futrell said the idea must still be approved by delegates to theNEA's annual convention in New Orleans in July.   Futrell told the news conference that if a laboratory schooldistrict decided to adopt a merit pay plan, the national unionwould not object.   She also said the NEA was prepared to provide some financialsupport for the experiments and said that bold action is needed torevive what she called lagging efforts to improve America's schools.   ``Five years after `A Nation At Risk,' lack of funding isstrangling education reform in state after state,'' she said,referring to the landmark report on the state of education.   She said Secretary of Education William J. Bennett ``wantsAmerica to believe that excellence costs nothing, that just talkingabout reform _ and blaming people _ will substitute for money. Itwon't.''   State and local governments have poured more money into publicschools, she said, ``but they can't do the job without help fromthe federal government.''   The federal share of the public school budget has slipped from9.2 percent in fiscal 1980 to 6.2 percent in fiscal 1988, she said,and education's share of the overall federal budget has droppedfrom 2.5 percent in fiscal 1979 to 1.8 percent in fiscal 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
