Section 501(b) of theAct provides that, subject to valid existing rights, the lands added tothe National Forest are to be administered by the Secretary of Agriculturein accordance with the Act and the laws, rules, and regulations applicableto the National Forest System.Section 501(b) further specifies that the Copper River-Rude River additionand the Copper River-Bering River portion of the existing Chugach NationalForest ``. . . be managed primarily to assure the conservation of fishand wildlife and their habitat.'' The Act permits the taking of fish andwildlife pursuant to the Act and other applicable State and Federal law,but specifies that only multiple-use activities consistent with the conservationof fish and wildlife and their habitat shall be permitted. Finally, section501(b) requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue rules and regulationsto implement the provisions of this section.National Forest System lands are managed for multiple uses and the sustainedyield of products and services. As provided by the National Forest ManagementAct (16 U.S.C. 1600 (note)) the mix of uses and outputs from national forestsis determined through the execution of a land and resource management planin accordance with the rules at 36 CFR Part 219. The effect of section501(b) is to recognize the outstanding fish and wildlife resource on twoareas of the Chugach National Forest and to require that these values begiven primacy in determining management direction for these two areas.The areas are still subject to multiple-use sustained yield managementand to the land management planning process set forth by National ForestManagement Act and the regulations at 36 CFR Part 219.The effect and intent of these proposed rules is to integrate the specialmanagement direction of section 501 of ANILCA with the other statutoryrequirements governing the management of National Forest lands. Becausethere are extensive regulations governing land management planning, authorizationsof special uses, and environmental analysis documentation, these proposedrules are limited to the mechanisms necessary to integrate management ofthe two units with those processes and to give adequate notice to affectedparties of how uses will be evaluated.<ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Proposed Rule</ITAG>Section 241.20 Scope and applicabilityParagraph (a) of this proposed section would establish the regulatory frameworkin which this rule is being promulgated; that is, that the proposed ruleis supplemental to the general regulations governing use and occupancyof the National Forest both nationwide and in Alaska.Paragraph (b) establishes the geographic area and land ownership statusto which the rule applies. Geographically, the rule will apply to the CopperRiver-Bering River portion of the Chugach National Forest as well as thearea added to the Chugach National Forest by section 501(a) of the AlaskaNational Interest Lands Conservation Act and referred to in that sectionof the Act as the ``Copper/Rude River addition''. In combination, the CopperRiver-Bering River portion of the Chugach National Forest and the Copper/RudeRiver addition comprise the Copper River Management Area as described anddisplayed in the Chugach National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan,July 1984. There are significant Non-Federal and private land holdingswithin the Copper River Management Area, primarily owned by the State ofAlaska as well as Native Corporations organized under the provisions ofthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. This section clarifies that theprovisions of this rule do not apply to these non-Federal lands.Paragraph (c) clarifies that the regulations have no effect on the longestablished responsibility and authority of the State of Alaska for managementof fish and wildlife.Paragraph (d) would provide a clear statement that the primary purposefor the management of the Copper/Rude River addition and the Copper River-BeringRiver portion of the Chugach National Forest as provided by section 501(b)of ANILCA is the conservation of fish and wildlife and their habitat andthat direction for managing fish and wildlife resources shall be documentedin the land and resource management plan.Section 241.22 Consistency determinationsThis section is the core of the regulations. It includes the standardsby which multiple-use activities would be evaluted for their impacts onconservation of fish and wildlife as well as necessary administrative andprocedural mechanisms for implementation.Paragraph (a) would require that all proposed multiple-use activities beevaluated as to their consistency with the primary management purpose ofconservation of fish and wildlife and their habitat. ANILCA section 501(b)clearly states that ``. . . the conservation of fish and wildlife and theirhabitat shall be the primary purpose for the management . . .'' of theCopper River Delta. As previously noted, the full range of multiple-useactivities normally associated with National Forest management are alsopermitted by section 501(b) but only to the extent that such activitiesare consistent with the primary management purpose. The standards proposedin this section of the regulations are designed to ensure that permittedmultiple-use activities on the Copper River Delta either (1) further theprimary management purpose of conservation of fish and wildlife and theirhabitat, or (2) do not adversely affect the conservation of fish and wildlifeand their habitat.Paragraph (b) is an administrative provision that directs the responsibleforest officer to incorporate the consistency determination required byparagraph (a) into the environmental analysis process.Paragraph (c) would provide for the development of guidelines for carryingout or permitting specific multiple-use activities through the land managementplanning process required by the National Forest Management Act and implementingregulations at 36 CFR Part 219. As part of the land management planningprocess, the forest would identify classes or categories of uses and activities,develop generic management requirements for each, and develop prescriptionsnecessary to ensure that the specific proposed activity is consistent withconservation of fish and wildlife and their habitat. The responsible forestofficer would evaluate a prospective activity against the guidelines inthe approved forest plan in making the determination required by paragraph(a). Under the proposed rule, the guidelines would be the starting pointfor a more site-specific analysis of a specific proposed activity.Paragraph (d) would affirm the authority of the responsible forest officerto incorporate into any permit or other authorization any reasonably practicablemeasures which are determined to be necessary to maintain consistency withthe primary management purpose of conservation of fish and wildlife andtheir habitat. This ability to alter authorizations is fundamental to beingable to achieve conservation of fish and wildlife and their habitat andis already authorized by 36 CFR 251.56, which requires that special useauthorizations contain terms and conditions to ``minimize damage to scenicand esthetic values and fish and wildlife habitat and otherwise protectthe environment.''Likewise, paragraph (e) would affirm the authority granted at 36 CFR 251.60 and 251.61 for the responsible Forest Officer to terminate, suspend,revoke, or otherwise modify any activity if it is determined that suchmeasures are required to ensure conservation of fish and wildlife and theirhabitat. The provision also provides for notification and the opportunityto comment to affected parties unless the provision of such opportunitywould likely result in irreparable harm to the conservation of fish andwildlife and their habitat.Paragraph (f) would affirm that these regulations in no way affect subsistenceactivities in accordance with andSection; 241.23 of these regulations orother applicable law.Section 241.23 Taking of fish and wildlifeThe taking of fish and wildlife for subsistence, sport, and commercialpurposes are important activities in the Copper River Management Area andparagraph (a) affirms that these activities would be allowed to continueunder the proposed rule in accordance with applicable State and Federallaw and regulation.Paragraph (b) gives notice that the taking of fish and wildlife for subsistencewould be continued to the extent that such takings would be consistentwith the conservation of fish and wildlife and their habitats.Similarly paragraph (c) recognizes the importance of the continued opportunityfor the establishment and use of temporary facilities and equipment directlyand necessarily related to the taking of fish and wildlife. However, thisparagraph permits the Forest Supervisor to restrict or prohibit such usesif they materially interfere with or adversely affect fish and wildlifeconservation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Involvement</ITAG>In addition to publishing this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Forest Service intends to ask local businesses,local government entities, the State of Alaska, affected Alaska NativeCorporations, the congressional delegation, the Alaska Land Use Counciland other Federal agencies to comment on these proposed regulations toensure that interested parties continue to be involved in their development.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>These regulations have been evaluated as to their effect on subsistenceuses in accordance with section 810 of the Alaska National Interest LandsConservation Act (Pub. L. 96-487). As a result of the evaluation, it hasbeen determined that no significant restriction of subsistence uses willoccur as a result of the promulgation of these regulations.This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291, and ithas been determined that it is not a major rule. The regulations will havelittle or no effect on the economy. Moreover, the Secretary of Agriculturehas determined that this action will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. These regulations contain noinformation collection or recordkeeping requirements as defined by thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Based on both past experience and environmentalanalysis, this proposed rule will have no significant effect on the humanenvironment, individually or cumulatively. Therefore, this action is categoricallyexcluded from any requirement for documentation in an environmental assessmentor environmental impact statement (40 CFR 1508.4).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 241</ITAG>Intergovernmental relations, National Forests, Wildlife, Wildlife refuges.Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, it is proposed to amend Title36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter II, Part 241 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 241_FISH AND WILDLIFE</ITAG>1.
