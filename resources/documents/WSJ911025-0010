But documents and letters sent by Mr. Bakerto both Israel and Syria over the past five months paint aless flattering portrait of Mr. Baker's diplomacy.   As the Bush administration began laying the groundworklast spring for a Middle East peace conference, the StateDepartment provided both the Arab states and Israel withconfidential statements spelling out clearly the basis forthe proposed talks. The statements, which became the basisfor the letters of invitation issued to the conference, forman explicit definition of the Bush administration's view ofthe peace process.</LP><TEXT>   In the statement received by Israel, dated May 16, theState Department promised a &quot;dual track process . . . {thatwill include} bilateral and multilateral negotiations&quot;between Israel and Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and thePalestinians. In Israel, the fact that Syria had apparentlyagreed to direct bilateral talks with Israel was perceived asa major step forward by Damascus toward an acceptance of thelegitimacy of the Jewish state.   But bilateral talks by themselves were not enough todemonstrate a genuine intention in Syria or any other Arabstate to live in peace with Israel. Only through multilateraltalks with all of its neighbors -- on issues such as armscontrol, missile proliferation, water rights, etc. -- couldIsrael be assured that its neighbors had finally come toterms with its existence. The U.S. accepted the logic ofIsrael's position, and promised in its May 16 statement that&quot;multilateral negotiations will be launched within two weeks{of the bilateral talks} to address regionwide issues.&quot;   It was Syria's apparent acceptance of this commitment tomultilateral talks that prompted Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir to hail &quot;revolutionary change&quot; in the Syrianattitude, and to accept in principle the administration'splans for an international peace conference -- a negotiatingformat that Israel had long opposed for fear that it was adevice by the Arab states to avoid direct negotiations. IfSyrian leader Hafez Assad were prepared to talk about allareas of concern to Israel, then it meant that he was notinterested solely in regaining the Golan Heights at thebargaining table, but in real peace.   But something happened on the way to the peace conference.According to American diplomats, almost as soon as Mr. Bakerbegan his shuttle diplomacy between Jerusalem and Damascus tonail down the specifics of the conference, Mr. Assad began toretreat from his commitment to participate in multilateraltalks with Israel. Without multilateral talks there would beno discussion of arms control -- a matter of some importanceto Israel in light of the massive purchase by Syria of Scud-Cmissiles and other weapons in the months following the GulfWar.   At the same time, Saudi Arabia was also backing away fromits implied promise to participate in multilateral talks withIsrael. Instead of standing firm and cashing in the IOUsearned during the American-led war against Saddam Hussein,the U.S. began to waver. In discussions with Arab officials,according to a senior American diplomat involved in thenegotiations, &quot;after discovering the vehemence of the Arabreaction {against multilateral talks} we decided not to trybreaking down the brick wall.&quot;   The State Department notified Israel and the Arab statesin November that &quot;multilateral talks will still be launchedwithin two weeks&quot; of the bilateral talks -- but only &quot;toorganize discussions on regional issues.&quot; (Emphasis added.)In other words, the U.S. was promising to have the conferenceparticipants meet to discuss having discussions.   Having won one concession from Mr. Baker, Mr. Assad triedfor -- and obtained -- another. In early October, the U.S.informed Israel that participation in the multilateral talkswould be purely voluntary: &quot;Those parties who wish to attendmultilateral negotiations will convene two weeks after theopening&quot; of the bilateral talks. Syria was a party thatplainly did not wish to. When an Israeli negotiatorquestioned a State Department official as to the utility ofmultilateral talks in the absence of Syria, the officialresponded with the good news that Mauritania and Moroccowould be attending.   Nor was this the end to Mr. Baker's acquiescence to Syriandemands. Originally, the U.S. had said the objective of theconference was &quot;peace treaties&quot; between the quarreling statesof the Middle East. But the term &quot;peace treaties&quot; wasunacceptable to Mr. Assad, and so was deleted.   Likewise, the choice of Madrid as the site of the talkswas a concession to Syrian pressure. The State Departmentsays that Madrid was chosen for reasons of &quot;security.&quot; The1992 Olympics are to be held in Barcelona, and so -- StateDepartment officials have told reporters -- Spanishauthorities have made elaborate preparations to secure theircountry from terrorist attack.   But Israeli officials say -- and this is confirmed byAmerican diplomats based in Israel -- that they had been ledto believe that the negotiations, like those conducted in thepast with Egypt and Lebanon, would be held in Israel and theArab countries. The Camp David accords, for example, werefirst negotiated at alternating sites in Israel and Egypt andonly wrapped up at Camp David. Syria's willingness to allowIsareli negotiators onto its territory and to send itsnegotiaters to Israel would have confirmed the peacefulintentions of its Arab leader and helped to prepare the Arabpopulations for a real peace.   But Syria refused to consider on-site talks and the U.S.backed down. The U.S.'s second offer was to hold the talks inEurope, and it specifically suggested the Hague -- a popularvenue for peace talks for nearly a hundred years -- as anappropriate location. Damascus again said no. The Hague isthe capital of the Netherlands, a country that, the Syrianscomplained, was &quot;too pro-Israeli.&quot; Syria -- not the U.S. --then proposed Madrid, the capital of a country that hastilted toward the Arab side of the Middle East dispute andthat hosts the largest Palestine Liberation Organizationembassy in Europe.   American indulgence has emboldened Syria to go evenfurther. This past week, Iran hosted a conference of Mulsimfundamentalists at which participants vowed to destroy Israeland attack &quot;American targets around the world.&quot; Among thoseattending -- and with the loudest voices -- were twoPalestinian terrorist leaders who are headquartered in andtrained, financed and supported by Damascus: Ahmed Jabril,head of the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine-General Command, who carried out the bombing of PanAmerican Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and Col. AbuMousa, head of Fatah-Uprising. Both men vowed to kill anyonewho attended the peace talks in Madrid. When the Tehranconference ended, Abu Mousa returned to his headquarters inDamascus, located on a Syrian military base.   In the end, the credibility of America's assurances toIsrael that its Arab neighbors truly desire peace will be thedetermining factor in any decision by Israel to make tangibleconcessions in exchange for Arab leaders' intangiblepromises. And only if the Arab leaders prepare theirpopulation for the reality of peace with Israel -- by theirdeclared willingness to sign peace treaties with Israel andmeet face to face with Israelis on home territory -- willpeace ever come. The track record of the U.S. and Syria overthe past five months suggests that neither condition will bemet.   ---   Mr. Emerson writes on the Mideast and internationalsecurity.</TEXT></DOC>
