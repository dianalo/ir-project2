With the season of preliminary winnowing nearly over,it's worth recapturing its gaudier moments and amazing contretemps.The primary campaigns may not have produced startling breakthroughsin political ground but, as the following report shows, they rankhigh in the long tradition of politics as entertainment.</TEXT><BYLINE>By SAUL PETT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Once there were 14 candidates for president.Now there are three.   Has the wheat been separated from the chaff? Has it beensurvival of the fittest or survival of the hardiest, richest,cleverest, slickest?   Best or not, this is what's left after the strangest primaryseason in memory, a mad marathon in which history was shaped byphilandering and plagiarism, pratfalls and yawns.   Now, finally, the pack has dwindled down to a tidy few after 66primaries and 42 precinct caucuses across the land and in all theisland territories and clusters of expatriates abroad. About 30million people have voted, at least $170 million has been spent, 42debates have been debated, umptyfour-hundred speeches have floatedup to the poor ozone in clouds of charge and countercharge on theorder of ``so's your old man.'' The last pockets of insomniacresistance have fallen.   It is a campaign that has gone from the Marx Brothers to ``GuessWho's Coming to Dinner,'' a movie about white liberals who suddenlylearn their daughter is dating a black man. In February, peoplewere asking what does Jesse Jackson really want, a cabinet job? InMarch, they were beginning to wonder whom President Jackson wouldput in his cabinet. By June, they were asking what Mr. Jacksonwould settle for outside the Oval Office.   Candidates moved ahead, candidates fell behind, definitionstwisted, rationalizations multiplied. The media decreed that a manloses if he does not win by enough.   Even winning big could be suspect. Michael Dukakis won big inWisconsin. But Hark! An exit poll then showed that fewer of hissupporters voted for him ``with enthusiasm'' than did the votersfor Jackson and Albert Gore. Meaningful? Ominous?   There was something for everybody. If you ran second, it wasbecause the winner outspent you. If you ran third, it was becausehe distorted your record. If you ran fourth, you emphasized thatyou trounced the man who ran fifth. If you ran fifth, you exultedin the fact that you did better than last week. If you ran last,you dug down deep and claimed you were doing better than expected.Sooner or later they all beat ``expected.''   Something for everybody. In 1936, Alf Landon was buried byFranklin Roosevelt in the greatest (until then) landslide inhistory. Some years later, Landon and his wife ran into NormanThomas, the perennial Socialist candidate. Landon said, ``Dear, I'dlike you to meet the man I licked in 1936.''   The election of 1988 already owns a unique place in history onseveral counts, we are told by Paul F. Boller Jr., author of``Presidential Campaigns.''   No black candidate became a major factor in a presidentialelection before. No man was a candidate twice in the same campaign.No previous race had two preachers running. No candidate ever quitthe race before because of infidelity or plagiarism. Thoughpresidential candidates from Tom Jefferson to Jack Kennedy havebeen whispered about before, none lost an election because ofbedroom sport.   But fate failed Gary Hart even in the tiny detail. For example,the boat he and the young model shared in the Caribbean.   Couldn't it have been named something romantic but impersonallike Windsong or North Star, or something personal but innocentlike Bonus Baby or Dad's Day Off, or something presidential likeDestiny or Yankee Leader, but why, by what mystical movement of thespheres, did they reach so far down the scale of human aspirationto call it _ months later, one still cringes _ to call it MonkeyBusiness?   In their zeal, reformers have managed to steer the nominatingprocess out of the smoke-filled rooms and into the gas-filledfrenzy of more primaries and more candidates. The traffic isparticularly heavy when the incumbent is not running and the heirapparent is less than apparent.   Hart was clearly the front-running Democrat until he quit. Thenspeculation and attention fastened on three non-candidates, Gov.Mario Cuomo of New York and Senators Bill Bradley of New Jersey andSam Nunn of Georgia. The actual candidates had trouble gettingtheir names in the papers until someone raised the shades on Sen.Joseph Biden of Delaware. There, suddenly, was a candidate forpresident of the United States giving voice to words, images andreflections that belonged to the head of the British Labor Party.   Caught, Biden confessed his ``mistakes'' and withdrew. The urgeto confess, it seemed, was in the air.   Dukakis' campaign manager confessed he was the one who blew thewhistle on Biden, which he figured was, after all, his job. Dukakisconfessed how sorry he was and his campaign manager resigned in thespreading mea culpa. Hart confessed to infidelity. Pat Robertson,campaigning on a call for pre-marital restraint, was caught withhis marriage license showing, and confessed that, yes, it was datedonly 10 weeks before his son's birth certificate.   Across the political landscape, Judge Douglas Ginsburg trippedon his way to the Supreme Court when he confessed he had oncesmoked marijuana. So did I, said Gore. Me, too, said Bruce Babbitt.I have sinned, wept Jimmy Swaggart, who wasn't even a candidate.   It would be difficult to choose among the campaign's mostdramatic moments. For example:   High noon in the Senate of the United States.   Eyes cold with anger, the minority leader strode around the wellof the chamber to the presiding officer's desk, where sat the vicepresident of the United States.   ``What kind of candidate would put out a statement attackinganother candidate and his wife without reading it?'' Robert Dolesnapped.   ``Your people called me a `cornered lap dog,''' said George Bush.   ``I didn't call you a lap dog,'' said Robert Dole.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
