Mary Rose Oakar said Sunday after returningfrom a trip to Lebanon.   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun, whose forces control eastBeirut, and acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss in Moslem west Beirut,met separately with Oakar, D-Ohio, and Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va. onSaturday.   Oakar said she told both leaders that Friday was the fifthbirthday in captivity for America's longest-held hostage,Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson.   ``I brought him up at both the meetings with the major leadersand they pledged to help,'' she said.   Hoss told the lawmakers the taking of 18 Western hostages ``wasa gross violation of human rights,'' Oakar said in an interview.``He said on a daily basis they're trying to pave the way for theirreturn.''   ``One thing that they both said was that they feel terrible ...that people think hostage-taking is synonymous with the Lebanesepeople. They regret that the world opinion is such that peopledon't make a distinction,'' she said.   Oakar said her talks with the leaders convinced her there couldbe a way to win Aoun's support of an Arab peace plan to endLebanon's 14-year-old civil war. Aoun has rejected the pact andconvened an emergency meeting of his Cabinet on Sunday amid hintshe may dissolve Parliament to torpedo an Arab peace plan.   But Oakar said she believes a compromise could win Aoun'ssupport. ``It seems to me that in the finessing of compromise therecould be some kind of gesture (to Aoun). They could move the Syriantroops largely out of the city and into the mountains, forinstance.''   Aoun rejected the plan because it fails to set a deadline forthe pullout of 40,000 Syrian troops sent into the country in 1976.   Oakar said the trip was intended to show the Lebanese peoplethey haven't been forgotten by the United States, which inSeptember pulled its ambassador and 29 other diplomats out of thecountry.   The private diplomatic mission was not approved by the StateDepartment, which blocked previous attempts by Oakar and Rahall togo to Beirut.   Oakar and Rahall visited Lebanon in 1982 at the height of thefighting between Israeli, Syrian and Lebanese troops to condemn theIsraeli invasion of Lebanon. Oakar said she and Rahall are the onlytwo members of the House who are of Lebanese descent.</TEXT></DOC>
