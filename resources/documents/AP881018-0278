On other futures markets, precious metals were slightly lower;most energy futures fell sharply; cattle posted steep while porkfutures were mixed; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; andstock-index futures advanced.   Reports that as many as half of Peru's 70,000 metals miners wereout on strike fueled a late rally in the copper market, analystssaid. The contracts for both spot and December delivery hit newlife-of-contract highs for the 10th time in the past 12 sessions.   Copper for spot delivery settled at $1.38 a pound, up 3.9 centsfrom Monday while the contract for delivery in December rose 3.2cents to $1.246 a pound.   The market opened steady and traded on a fairly even keel formost the session in light of Monday's report that London MetalExchange stocks had fallen last week by 4,550 metric tons insteadof the 7,000-to-9,000-ton decline that had been expected, analystssaid.   Nevertheless, ``LME stocks continued their down trend andprobably will continue to decline,'' said Fred Demler, metalseconomist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.   ``Inventories are critically low, consumption remains good inJapan, parts of Europe and the United States and production hasfaltered a bit as of late,'' he said.   ``The only thing that's negative in the copper market right nowis that it's due for a technical correction _ it's moved up muchtoo fast,'' Demler said. ``But most most of the fundamentalssuggest the market will be tight for another five to six months.''   Gold and silver futures retreated slightly in reaction to areversal of recent trends toward a weaker dollar and lower pricesfor crude oil and other commodities, Demler said.   Gold settled $2 to $4 lower with December at $415.10 troy ounce;silver was 5 cents lower across the board with December at $6.425 atroy ounce.   Crude oil futures plunged on the New York Mercantile Exchangeamid heavy profit-taking but market players still believes OPECmembers will reach agreement soon on a plan to stabilize prices,analysts said.   ``The market was overbought and a lot of people wanted to takeprofits,'' said Peter Beutel, energy analyst with Elders FuturesInc. in New York.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 60 cents to 67 centslower with November at $14.61 a barrel; heating oil was 1.59 centsto 1.79 cents lower with November at 42.29 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was 1 cent lower to .16 cent higher with November at 46.92cents a gallon.   Cattle futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago MercantileExchange on profit-taking following Monday's advance tolife-of-contract highs for all delivery months, analysts said.   The cattle market had rallied on expectations for higher cashmarkets and ideas that the Agriculture Department's quarterlycattle-on-feed report, due out after the close on Friday, will showa significant reduction in the number of cattle being fattened forslaughter.   Live cattle settled .35 cent to 1.15 cents lower with October at72.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to 1.07 centslower with October at 81.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 centlower to .25 cent higher with October at 39.90 cents a pound;frozen pork bellies were .18 cent to .57 cent lower with Februaryat 48.77 cents a pound.   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower on the ChicagoBoard of Trade, reflecting the weak tone of the grain exportbusiness, analysts said.   Corn harvesting was 63 percent complete as of Sunday in the top17 producing states while soybean harvesting was 90 percentfinished in the top 19 producing states, the USDA said late Monday.   Wheat settled 1 cent to 7\ cents lower with December at $4.23 abushel; corn was 2} cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at$2.92\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 2{ cents higher withDecember at $2.57{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 5{ centslower with November at $8.05{ a bushel.
