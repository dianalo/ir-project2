These ingots, when placedin an ultralow background system using super-clean materials, multilayeredcosmic ray anticoincidence, and passive shielding, provide very low background.The spectrometers provide an improved minimum detectable activity forenvironmental measurements. Minimum detectable activity coupled withhigh counting efficiencies and good peak-to-Compton ratios have madegreater sample analysis throughout possible. The minimum detectible radioactivityin the sample is becoming more important as environmental concerns andregulations require more sensitive measurement of the radioactivity levelsallowed in the work place and in the home.</TEXT></DOC>
