Parliament also for the first time elected a non-communist asits speaker.   The demonstrators, gathered in the city that has become thefocus for protests against the East German leadership, demanded theCommunist Party abolish its monopoly on power.   West German television newscasts estimated the number ofprotesters at between 200,000 and 300,000.   The protest came after a weekend in which East Germans by themillions exercised their new freedom to travel, a right granted bythe government to counter an exodus of emigres to the West.   East Berliners today began returning to their jobs after fourdays of frenzied celebrations at the newly opened Berlin Wall, andofficials said fewer than 1 percent of those who crossed into theWest during the weekend chose to stay in West Germany.   About 100,000 East German visitors still headed West today, WestGerman authorities said. The flow of visitors was far slower thanduring the weekend, when more than 3 million people made the trip.   In East Berlin, the Parliament convened and elected Hans Modrow,a leading reformer, to be the new premier. He would replace WilliStoph, who resigned along with his 44-member Cabinet on Tuesday.   Modrow is a well known reformer within the party, which has beenheaded by Egon Krenz since Oct. 18. Krenz himself has promised somereforms, including free elections.   Earlier, Parliament elected a non-communist, Guenther Maleuda,as its new speaker in an unprecedented secret ballot. The rulingCommunist Party did not propose a candidate for the post.   Maleuda, 58, is the chairman of the Democratic Peasants party,one of the four small parties that have been allied with theCommunists for 40 years. During the political turmoil in recentweeks, the four parties have been cautiously exploring ways ofbecoming more independent.   Also today, the party's 163-member Central Committee set Dec. 15for an emergency party congress, which would have the power toelect an entire new Central Committee and change party politics.   Maleuda was elected to replace Horst Sindermann, a Communistparty official who was sacked from the ruling Politburo last weekand today resigned from his post of Parliament president.   Maleuda surprisingly defeated Manfred Gerlach, chairman of theLiberal Democratic party who was one of the first politicians tocall for broad political and economic reforms.   No candidate won a majority on the first ballot. In a run-offagainst Gerlach, Maleuda received 246 votes, while Gerlach got 230.The parliament has 500 members, but only 477 attended the sessionand one abstained.   Meanwhile, Francois Mitterrand invited the leaders of theEuropean Community countries to a special meeting Saturday in Paristo discuss the rapidly changing situation in Europe, thepresidential palace announced today in Paris.   West Berlin began cleaning up the remnants of a celebration thatbegan Thursday, with the opening of East Germany's borders, andfinally began winding down Sunday night.   Federal government officials in Bonn said fewer than 1 percentof the estimated 3 million East Germans who arrived over theweekend decided to stay in the West, a sign that the new open-doorpolicy would not backfire.   Lack of freedom to travel had been one of the major complaintsof hundreds of thousands of East Germans who abandoned theirCommunist homeland permanently before the borders opened.   ``It was something special, but anyway, things have to go on asnormal,'' said Peter Normann, an East Berliner who visited WestBerlin and then went home.   West Berlin's bustling Kurfuerstendamm, the tree-lined shoppingthoroughfare that had been jammed with revelers, today was filledwith workers and shoppers.   The carpet of shattered bottles, crushed cans, fast-foodwrappers and cigarette packs was swept up and hauled off overnight,leaving behind few traces of the celebration.   East Berlin Mayor Erhard Krack strode through a new breach inthe 28-year-old Berlin Wall on Sunday and shook hands with WestBerlin Mayor Walter Momper. The meeting took place at the PotsdamerPlatz, once the vibrant hub of a united Berlin.   Momper, speaking this morning on NBC's ``Today'' show, said themayors discussed the need for coordination between authorities inboth sides of the city to handle the increased car and foot trafficresulting from the new border policy.   Today's announcement on the border areas covers both the854-mile frontier between East Germany and West Germany and theeven more notorious stretch of land running along the Berlin Wallin East Berlin. The borders had been one of the most closelyguarded sections of the Iron Curtain.   In a highly symbolic gesture, West German President Richard vonWeizsaecker walked into East Berlin early today and met with ahigh-ranking East German army officer on a piece of land formingpart of the abandoned ``death strip.'' The officer was notimmediately identified.   The ``death strip'' had already lost much of its significanceafter East Germans guards were ordered earlier this year not toshoot at would-be civilian escapees and after East Germans beganfleeing by way of third countries.   More than 200,000 East Germans left the country this year. Theexodus, combined with weeks of street protests, led to leadershipchanges and pledges of democratic reform.   The embattled Communist leadership is still struggling to find acourse that will satisfy growing demands for change while leavingthe existing party structure in place.   Guenter Schabowski, a member of the ruling Politburo and EastBerlin's Communist Party chief, said the move to open the bordersshowed that the East German leadership was serious about reforms.   ``We took the correct and necessary steps in a complicatedsituation and it has helped win back trust,'' the state-run newsagency ADN quoted Schabowski as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
