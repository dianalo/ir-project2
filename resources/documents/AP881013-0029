Officials at theDefense and Energy Departments said that for security reasons theycould not specify the exact amount of tritium that the governmenthas and needs, or when a shortage would become critical.   In a related development, Energy Department spokeswoman GailBradshaw said tests showed no health threat to three workersexposed to radiation at a nuclear weapons facility, the Rocky Flatsplutonium processing plant in Golden, Colo., on Sept. 29. The planthas been closed by the government for safety reasons.   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington, seeking to defuse criticismof lax safety standards at nuclear facilities, announced Tuesdaythat one of three tritium-producing reactors at the EnergyDepartment's Savannah River Plant, in Aiken, S.C., will begin ``aphased start-up'' in December, culminating in January.   The three reactors at Savannah River, first brought intooperation in 1954, have been closed down since August for safetyand maintenance checks, and Herrington announced new operatingprocedures to reduce the danger of a mishap.   The Energy Department manufactures nuclear warheads for thePentagon, and its Savannah River reactors are the sole source ofplutonium and tritium for bombs.   Herrington told a congressional panel last Feb. 23 that ``we areawash in plutonium.''   A delay of several years in renewing the production of tritiumis possible because of problems at Savannah River. The governmentdoes not plan to start construction of a new generation of nuclearweapons reactors until the early 1990s for completion around theturn of the century.   Due to safety problems, the Savannah River reactors will beoperated only at half power, energy officials say.   Tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, is used to increase theefficiency of nuclear warheads, allowing engineers to producesmaller and lighter weapons, said Tom Cochran, a physicist andco-author of ``The Nuclear Weapons Handbook,'' a detailed analysisof the U.S. arsenal.   Tritium, however, has a short halflife. Half of any quantity oftritium will degrade in 12.3 years, meaning that 5.5 percent of thesample will degrade per year.   That means the government needs to replenish the tritium moduleson each of its estimated 22,000 warheads to assure that they havethe anticipated explosive power, said Cochran.   The tritium module on each warhead is replenished every eight to10 years, said a Pentagon source.   Tritium is so important for modern thermonuclear weapons that agroup of physicists recently suggested banning its production as ameans of forcing arms cuts by the United States and the SovietUnion.   ``Tritium is unique among nuclear weapons materials in itspotential to drive nuclear arms reductions if both sides agreed toa halt in its production,'' said the proposal, which appeared inthe Sept. 2 edition of Science magazine.   The proposal was written by J. Carson Mark, former leader of thetheoretical division of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in NewMexico, and Thomas D. Davies, Milton M. Hoenig and Paul L.Levanthol.   Neither the Soviet Union nor United States has accepted theproposal to cease tritium production. And W.G. Sutcliffe, ascientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, wrote in thesame edition of Science that banning tritium production could``leave the United States in a vulnerable position'' because it isnot known exactly to what degree the Soviets depend on it.</TEXT></DOC>
