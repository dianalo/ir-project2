No financial institution may issue or sell a bankcheck, cashier's check, traveler's check, or money order to any individualin connection with a transaction or group of such contemporaneous transactionswhich involves United States coins or currency (or other such monetaryinstruments as the Secretary may prescribe) in amounts or denominationsof $3,000 or more unless_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The individual has a transaction account with such financial institutionand the financial institution_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Verifies that fact through a signature card or other informationmaintained by such institution in connection with the account of such individual;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) Records the method of verification in accordance with regulationswhich the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The individual furnishes the financial institution with such formsof identification as the Secretary of the Treasury may require in regulationswhich the Secretary shall prescribe and the financial institution verifiesand records such information in accordance with regulations which suchSecretary shall prescribe. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Report to Secretary Upon Request.</T3> Any information required tobe recorded by any financial institution under paragraph (1) or (2) ofsubsection (a) shall be reported to the Secretary of the Treasury at therequest of such Secretary. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) <T3>Transaction Account Defined.</T3> For purposes of this section, theterm ``transaction account'' has the meaning given to such term in section19(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Reserve Act. </ITAG>The legislative history indicates that Congress clearly felt that therewas a need for this provision, because money launderers commonly purchasebank checks, cashier's checks, money orders and traveler's checks for amountsunder $10,000. The House Committee Report noted that the only identificationrecords required for persons who conduct currency transactions in amountsunder $10,000 are those needed to open an account, thus permitting nonaccountholdersto conduct currency transactions below $10,000 without having to identifythemselves. The Committee indicated that it expected affected financialinstitutions to be ``fully cooperative and responsive to this law enforcementeffort.'' H. Rep. No. 100-716, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 7. <ITAG tagnum="84">Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking </ITAG>On December 23, 1988 (53 FR 51846), Treasury published an Advance Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking to solicit comments from the public on how bestto implement this provision. In the Advance Notice, Treasury suggestedthat the best way to implement this new identification requirement mightbe by requiring a chronological log of the purchase of bank checks, cashier'schecks, money orders and traveler's checks. One hundred fifty-six (156)comments were received from the public, primarily affected financial institutions,on how best to put this provision into effect. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Amendment </ITAG>The comments covered a wide range of issues. Treasury has considered theseideas in formulating the regulation being proposed today. Treasury is proposingthat a new section, ``Purchases of bank checks and drafts, cashier's checks,money orders and traveler's checks'' be added to the Bank Secrecy Act regulations,31 CFR part 103. The section would require that all financial institutionssubject to the Bank Secrecy Act regulations maintain a monthly chronologicallog or logs of their sales of bank checks and drafts, cashier's checks,money orders and traveler's checks to customers who purchase these instrumentswith currency in amounts of $3,000-$10,000 inclusive. If the purchaserhas a transaction account (as that term is defined in andSection;103.11(p))with the financial institution where the transaction is being conducted,the following information would be required on the log: (1) The name of the purchaser; (2) The number of the purchaser's account; (3) The date of purchase; (4) The branch where the purchase occurred; and (5) The type(s), serial number(s), and the dollar amount of each of theinstrument(s) purchased in currency. In addition, the financial institution would be required to verify thatthe individual is an accountholder, either through a signature card onfile or other record at the financial institution, if the accountholder'sidentity was verified at the time the account was opened, or at any subsequenttime, and that information was recorded on the signature card or otherfile or record. The method of verification used shall be noted on the log,such as ``checked computerized customer file system'', or ``checked signaturecard andplusmin;124-890.'' If the accountholder's identity was not verified previously, then the accountholdermust be treated as a nonaccountholder for purposes of verification of identityonly. The financial institution in that case shall verify the accountholder'sname and address by examination of a document that contains the name andaddress of the purchaser and normally is acceptable within the bankingcommunity as a means of identification when cashing checks for nondepositors,and shall record that specific identifying information on the log (<T3>e.g.,</T3> State of issuance and number of driver's license). Becausea credit card normally does not contain a name and address of the creditcard holder, a credit card alone generally would not be an adequate formof identification. The financial institution then may add that identifyinginformation to its records so that the accountholder need not be requiredto produce identification for subsequent purchases of these instruments.If the purchaser is a nonaccountholder, then the financial institutionshall record the following information on the log: (1) The name and address of the purchaser; (2) The social security number of the purchaser, or if the person is analien without a social security number, the purchaser's alien identificationnumber; (3) The date of birth of the purchaser; (4) The date of purchase; (5) The branch where the purchase occurred; (6) The type(s), serial number(s) and dollar amount of the instrument(s)being purchased;(7) For cashier's checks and bank checks or drafts, the payees on the instrument(s)purchased;(8) The amount of the purchase in currency; and(9) If the individual is purchasing the instrument for a third person,the name of the person on whose behalf the instrument is being purchasedand the account number of that third party if the third person is an accountholderat the institution. If the third person is not an accountholder, then thename, address and social security number, taxpayer identification numberor alien identification number of the third party shall be noted on thelog.In addition, for all nonaccountholders, the financial institution shallverify the purchaser's name and address by examination of a document thatcontains the name and address of the purchaser and normally is acceptablewithin the banking community as a means of identification when cashingchecks for nondepositors, and record that specific identifying informationon the log (<T3>e.g.,</T3> State of issuance and number of driver's license). Again,because of credit card normally does not contain a name and address ofthe credit card holder, a credit card alone generally would not be an adequateform of identification.Contemporaneous purchases of the same or different types of instrumentstotaling $3,000 or more would be treated as one purchase. Contemporaneousmeans originating, existing or happening at the same time. In addition,Treasury is using its general Bank Secrecy Act authority under 31 U.S.C.5313 to propose that multiple purchases during the same business day bythe same person be treated as one purchase if an individual employee, officer,director or partner of the financial institution has knowledge that thepurchases have taken place or there is knowledge on the part of the financialinstitution's computer system that the purchases have taken place. Financialinstitutions do not have to purchase new hardware or software computersystem to comply with this requirement. They may, but are not required,to change any of their computer programs or manual systems presently inplace.The financial institution may keep a single centralized chronological logor it may maintain individual chronological logs by branch. A separatechronological log for each type of instrument sold or issued also is permissible.If the financial institution maintains individual logs by branch, the financialinstitution must send those logs to a central location by the fifteenthday after the end of the calendar month for which the log was compiled.The logs need not be integrated with each other; they merely must be keptin one place. This will make it easier for both the financial institutionand the Treasury Department when it requests information from the financialinstitution about its sales of these instruments.Finally, the proposed regulation states that the Treasury Department mayrequest the information at any time. The financial institution must providethe information, whether the log is at the central location or still isat the branch, even though the information is not required to be forwardedto the centralized location until fifteen days after the close of the calendarmonth.<ITAG tagnum="84">Need for a Log</ITAG>Treasury considered alternatives types of logs suggested in the commentsto the Advance Notice. These alternatives included compiling a quarterlyor yearly report, keeping the information on a copy of the instrument,or requiring a new standardized form. After considering these alternatives,Treasury decided to propose that financial institutions maintain a chronologicallog or logs by institution or branch because this alternative providedthe most effective method of keeping the information required by the Secretaryunder section 5325 in one place, and easily accessible by both the financialinstitution and the Treasury Department. At the same time, it permits someflexibility for the financial institutions. Recording the information onlyon a copy of the instrument itself in many instances would force a financialinstitution to sift through thousands of documents from its many branchesin order to comply with a request for the information from the TreasuryDepartment. Also, while financial institutions may maintain copies of someof the money orders, traveler's checks, bank checks or drafts or cashier'schecks they sell or issue, they do not maintain copies of all the notedinstruments they sell or issue, and, indeed, may keep different kinds ofrecords for each of the instruments included. A quarterly or yearly reportalso was rejected because the information would not be as readily accessibleby Treasury as a monthly log. Finally, Treasury rejected the idea of requiringfinancial institutions to use a standardized form because it believes thatfinancial institutions should be given some flexibility in the way theinformation is recorded and the format of the required information. Thus,each financial institution would be free to develop its own standardizedform for internal use, if it so desired.Treasury wishes to minimize any delay in the completion of transactionsor the holding up of customer lines while the financial institution completesa log entry. The required information may be noted on a copy of the instrumentor other record associated with the instrument, and later transferred toa log after the purchase is concluded, at the end of the day, or, if keptat a branch, at the end of the month before the logs are sent to the centralizedlocation. For example, many banks sell cashier's checks and require thepurchaser to fill out an application prior to issuing the check. The requiredinformation could be noted on the application. After the customer leaves,the information could than be transferred to the log. Or, if it is a branchbank that maintains its own log and sends its logs to a centralized location,it could prepare the log at the end of the month prior to forwarding itto the bank's centralized location. Financial institutions should be aware, however, that Treasury has theright to request this information at any time. Thus, if Treasury requestsinformation on sales of these instruments at an institution that recordsthe information initially on another type of record and then transfersit to a log at a later date, the financial institution will have to beable to retrieve that information at any time after the purchase, evenif it is not entered yet on the log. For those financial institutions that keep branch log or logs, the logsmay be kept at the branch during the calendar month. The logs must be sentto the financial institution's centralized location within fifteen (15)days after the end of the month. The logs of purchases do not need to be formatted in any particular way,as long as all the required information is contained on the log. Some financialinstitutions may choose to maintain logs with the name of the branch, thedate of purchase, and/or the type of instrument at the top of each pageof the log; if so, then that information does not need to be repeated foreach individual purchase. In addition, financial institutions may maintain separate logs for eachdifferent type of instrument. The logs need not be integrated, at the branchlevel or at the centralized level, as long as the logs are all kept inone centralized place at the financial institution. For financial institutionsthat have branches all over the country, such as a telegraph or traveler'scheck company or a national securities dealer, the financial institutionmay centralize the logs by State, as opposed to one place for the entirecountry. However, a list of all such locations must be made available tothe Treasury Department upon request. <ITAG tagnum="84">Instruments and Transactions Covered </ITAG>Treasury is proposing that purchases of all types of official bank checksand drafts be included in the identification requirement not just thosethat a bank may officially label ``bank check'' or ``cashier's check.''Foreign drafts, so-called ``New York'' drafts and Treasurers checks allare types of bank checks and, hence, they specifically are included withinthe requirements of this section. In addition, in reliance on Treasury's authority in 31 U.S.C. 5313, theproposed regulation would cover all types of currency used to purchasethese instruments, not just ``United States coin and currency'' as notedin section 5325. This would conform the proposed regulation more closelyto the present definition of ``currency'' in the Bank Secrecy Act regulations,31 CFR 103.11(d), and would close a potential loophole whereby purchaserscould circumvent the requirements of this section merely by using foreigncurrency to purchase these instruments. Financial institutions should notethat proposed regulation is applicable only to currency purchases of theseinstruments, and does not include debits to accounts or purchases withchecks. The proposed regulation is applicable to all contemporaneous purchasesof all types of the instruments listed in the proposed regulation. Contemporaneousmeans occurring in the same period of time. This means that currency purchasestotaling between $3,000 and $10,000 inclusive that occur at the same timeof the same type of instrument (<T3>e.g., </T3>two $2,500 currency purchases of traveler's checks) wouldbe included as well as purchases that occur at the same time of differenttypes of instruments totaling between $3,000 and $10,000 inclusive (<T3>e.g., </T3>a $5,000 currency purchase of a $2,500 cashier's check and$2,500 in traveler's checks). In addition, Treasury is using its authority under 31 U.S.C. 5313 to proposethat the regulation also cover currency purchases of instruments totalingbetween $3,000 and $10,000 inclusive within the course of a business dayif a financial institution has knowledge that this has occurred. Treasuryfeels that this is necessary to avoid easy evasion of the identificationrequirement by those who simply lower their purchases to below $3,000 andcontinue to make repeated purchases of these instruments in currency duringthe course of a business day at the same financial institution. This proposaldoes not require a financial institution to purchase computer systems,or purchase additional hardware or software systems for their existingcomputers in order to comply. If the financial institution does not havea computer or manual system that would capture that information, the financialinstitution instead will have to rely on the knowledge of individual employees,officers, directors or partners of multiple purchases. For example, if a customer goes to different counters in the financialinstitution in order to purchase multiple bank checks or drafts, cashier'schecks, money orders or traveler's checks and an employee at the financialinstitution knows that the customer is purchasing or has purchased severaldifferent types of instruments at different windows during one businessday, those transactions must be aggregated and the identification requirementcomplied with if the total purchases are $3,000 or more in currency. Thisknowledge may come about because an employee sends the customer to severalwindows in order to make the purchases, or assists in making the differentpurchases for the customer while the customer waits. There also may besituations where an employee observes a customer come into the financialinstitution more than once during one business day and make currency purchasestotaling between $3,000 and $10,000 inclusive of several of these instruments.Because the employee in that situation has knowledge of the multiple transactions,the financial institution must obtain identification before completingthe last transaction.<ITAG tagnum="84">Exemptions Prohibited</ITAG>Some commenters to the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking requestedthat Treasury permit exemptions to the identification requirements in certaininstances. Treasury will not permit any exemptions to the requirements.The exemptions to the Bank Secrecy Act reporting requirements that nowexist generally are for transactions affecting accounts. Transactions thatwould be subject to this identification requirement are currency purchasesof these instruments and generally will not affect any account. Treasurysees no need to expand the exemption privilege in this instance.<ITAG tagnum="84">Identification Requirements</ITAG>In identifying accountholders, a financial institution will be permittedto check its records or files, including its computer system, to verifythat the person conducting the purchase indeed is an accountholder andto note the method of verification, <T3>e.g., </T3>``checked computerized customer file records'' or ``checkedsignature care andplusmin;123-67''. However, the financial institution mayrely on its record, file or computer system only if the accountholder'sidentification was verified at the time the account was opened, or at anysubsequent time thereafter, and that information was recorded in the financialinstitution's filed or records. Thus, in order to rely on the system, afinancial institution must have verified the identity of the accountholderat the time the account was opened, or at any other subsequent time, byexamination of a document containing a name and address, normally acceptablewithin the banking community as a means of identification when cashingchecks for nondepositors (such as a driver's license), and record thatspecific identifying information used in verifying the customer's identityin the financial encourages financial institutions that open accounts forcustomers to verify the identity of the person at the time the accountis opened.If a financial institution has not identified its accountholders at thetime the account is opened or at any subsequent time, then it must followthe procedures required for identifying nonaccountholders, which are similarto the requirements of 31 CFR 103.27. This means that the financial institutionmust examine a document that contains the name and address of the purchaserand that normally is acceptable within the banking community as a meansof identification when cashing checks for nondepositors, and record thatspecific identifying information on the log (<T3>e.g.,</T3> State of issuance and number of a driver's license.) Asnoted above, because a credit card normally does not contain the card holder'sname and address, a credit card alone generally will not be a sufficientmeans of identifying the purchaser. Once the financial institution doesobtain identifying information, however, it may add this information tothe signature card or other record and may rely upon it in the future.The financial institution does not have to obtain the other informationrequired for purchases by nonaccountholders, such as social security numbersor dates of birth.In addition, because Treasury is aware that many money launderers hireothers to make these purchases for them, Treasury is using its authorityunder 31 U.S.C. 5313 in order to require instruments for another personwith $3,000 to $10,000 inclusive in currency, the financial institutionmust record the name and account number of that third party, or if thethird party is not an accountholder, then the financial institution willrecord the name, address and the social security number, taxpayer identificationnumber or alien identification number of the third person.Treasury notes that not all financial institutions offer transaction accountswithin the definition in section 103.11. Indeed, most nonbank financialinstitutions, such as check cashers and sellers of money orders, do not.Therefore, Treasury expects that most nonbank financial institutions willhave to use the nonaccountholder identification procedures whenever theysell bank checks or drafts, cashier's checks, money orders or traveler'schecks to purchasers doing so with $3,000 to $10,000 inclusive in currency.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous Issues</ITAG>The record retention period for these records would be five years whichis the same retention period for all Bank Secrecy Act records. 31 CFR 103.38(d).Some commenters to the Advance Notice suggested that there may be Rightto Financial Privacy Act problems with these logs in that the logs mightcontain information on purchasers other than those covered by the regulation,for example, currency purchases of these instruments totaling less than$3,000. Treasury notes that to the extent that a financial institutionadds extraneous material to the log, it is the financial institution'sresponsibility either to delete the information not required by the regulationprior to providing the information to Treasury or to assume any risk inincluding the information. Treasury notes that recording this informationfor purchases over $10,000 and providing the information to Treasury uponrequest does not violate the Right to Financial Privacy Act, because thatinformation already is required to be reported to the Treasury Departmenton a Currency Transaction Report pursuant to andSection; 103.22.Some commenters to the Advance Notice asked how this requirement wouldinteract with the reporting requirements of section 103.22. For example,if a person makes a $6,000 currency deposit to his checking account andat the same time purchases a $7,000 cashier's check with $7,000 in currency,financial institutions wondered whether they would be required to filea Currency Transaction Report and maintain a record of the purchase ofthe cashier's check. Under 31 CFR 103.22(a), the financial institutionwould be required to file a Currency Transaction Report because the transactioninvolves currency in excess of $10,000. In addition, the financial institutionwould be required to record the information necessary to complete the log.This is because the reporting and recordkeeping regulations are separaterequirements and both requirements must be observed.Treasury believes that the information required by the new regulation willbe useful in identifying individuals who conduct currency transactionsto evade the reporting requirements by purchasing instruments below $10,000.This information is useful to law enforcement officials who are conductingmoney laundering and other investigations. In addition, it is believedthat by requiring identification for purchases at $3,000 and above, moneylaundering will be deterred.Treasury encourages financial institutions to report suspicious activityby persons that the financial institution believes may be taking actionsto evade the reporting requirements of andSection; 103.22 or the identificationrequirements of this regulation. Some examples of activity that might beconsidered suspicious include a reluctance on the part of the customerto produce identification, a customer taking back part of the currencyto reduce the purchase to below $3,000, or a customer coming into the sameinstitution on consecutive or near-consecutive business days, as observedby the financial institution employee, and purchasing bank checks, cashier'schecks, traveler's checks or money orders in amounts of less than $3,000.<T3>See</T3> BSA Administrative Ruling 88-1, dated June 22, 1988, printedat 53 FR 40062 (October 13, 1988). Financial institutions do not want tobe abused by the money laundering or the tax evader; Treasury urges financialinstitutions to know their customers to avoid becoming involved inadvertentlyin illegal activity.Finally, financial institutions should note that they do not have to instituteany new procedures or change their present procedures to comply with thisrequirement until a Final Rule is effective.<ITAG tagnum="84">Submission of Comments</ITAG>Treasury requests comments from all interested persons concerning the proposedamendments. While Treasury welcomes comments on all aspects of the proposal,it particularly is interested in receiving comments on the following issues:<ITAG tagnum="15">_What procedures do financial institutions follow now in issuing orselling bank checks or drafts, cashier's checks, money orders or traveler'schecks? To what extent are the procedures different if the purchaser isan accountholder as opposed to a nonaccountholder?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Do financial institutions have restrictions on the number or amountsof instruments that they will sell to a customer, either an accountholderor nonaccountholder, on one business day for currency?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_How long, from the date the final regulation is issued, will financialinstitutions need to implement this regulation?</ITAG>All comments received before the closing date will be carefully considered.Oral comments must be reduced to writing and submitted to Treasury to receiveconsideration. Comments received after the closing date and too late forconsideration will be treated as possible suggestions for future action.The Treasury Department will not recognize any materials or comments, includingthe name of any person submitting comments, as confidential. Any materialnot intended to be disclosed to the public should not be included in comments.All comments submitted will be available for public inspection during thehours that the Treasury Library is open to the public. The Treasury Libraryis located in Room 5030, 1500 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20220.Appointments must be made to view the comments. Persons wishing to viewthe comments submitted should contact Dorothy Lane of the Office of FinancialEnforcement at (202) 566-8022. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>This proposed rule, if adopted as a final rule, is not a major rule forpurposes of Executive Order 12291. It is not anticipated to have an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more. It will not result in amajor increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions. Itwill not have any significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or foreignmarkets. A Regulatory Impact Analysis therefore is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>It is hereby certified under section 605(b) of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq., </T3>that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The collections of information contained in this Notice of Proposed Rulemakinghave been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review inaccordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)).Comments on the collections of information and the burden estimate shouldbe directed to the Office of Financial Enforcement at the address notedabove or to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project(1505-0063), Washington, DC 20503.
