Officials said troops had surrounded at least four other housesbelieved to be hideouts of followers of former Lt. Col. Gregorio``Gringo'' Honasan.   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, commander of the National CapitalRegional Defense Command, said there was a distinct possibilityHonasan might be in one of the houses.   Honasan led the bloody Aug. 28 coup attempt but escaped April 2with 14 of his elite navy guards. The charismatic former lieutenantcolonel had been detained on the navy ship since his arrest lastDecember in a Manila suburb.   Biazon said three Marine companies and 30 police and soldierscarried out the raid one day after a tip that renegade troops werehiding in the Blue Ridge district of suburban Quezon City.   The raid lasted only 15 minutes, he said, and there was noresistance. Raiders seized 16 M-14 rifles, four M-16s, one lightmachine gun, five Israeli-made Uzis, a grenade launcher and severalgrenades.   Those arrested included Lt. Eraldo Mojica, commander of thesecurity force aboard the ship from which Honasan escaped. Two ofthose arrested were civilians, Biazon said.   Col. Emiliano Templo, chief of staff of the Capital RegionalCommand, said raids were continuing in hopes of capturing Honasan,who has vowed to continue his struggle against President CorazonAquino.   ``There are other places to be raided,'' Templo said. ``Maybe,before the night is over, we will know if he (Honasan) is here ornot.''   The raid took place as the military was on full alert to preventa new coup attempt while Mrs. Aquino paid a four-day visit to Chinaand Hong Kong. She left Thursday.   Before the raids, the military announced the filing of the firstmutiny charges against officers linked to Honasan's failed coup.   Military spokesman Lt. Anselmo Cabingan said those who have beenformally charged before a court martial include two lieutenantcolonels, a major and two lieutenants. Their arraignment has beenscheduled for Monday, he added.   At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 others woundedduring the coup attempt.   Military lawyers said more charges were to be filed soon againstmore than 100 military officers and enlisted men jailed inconnection with the coup attempt, the most serious of half a dozenbids to unseat Mrs. Aquino since she came to power in February 1986.   Also today, police clashed with stone-throwing leftists near theU.S. Embassy and blocked a nearby march by militant Moslemsprotesting the U.S. bombing raids on Libya two years ago.   Two demonstrators and one policeman were injured in the melee,the second near the embassy in two weeks. The clash broke out whenclub-swinging riot police charged a group of about 120 students whohad arrived at a square fronting the embassy, witnesses said.   They said three of the demonstrators who threw stones at policewere arrested.   At about the same time 100 yards away, police blocked a march byabout 350 Filipino Moslems who were heading for the embassy on amarch marking the second anniversary of U.S. bombing raids on Libyain 1986.   The Moslems dispersed peacefully after a brief rally at anintersection where they chanted anti-American slogans. They alsoburned the U.S., British and Israeli flags as well as an effigy ofPresident Reagan.   Leaflets distributed during the rally said the April 15, 1986,raids on the Libyan cities of Benghazi and Tripoli unmasked theUnited States as ``20th century barbarians.''   The U.S. bombings came 10 days after a terrorist bomb killed twoAmerican soldiers and a Turkish woman and injured more than 200people at a disco in West Berlin. Libyan officials said 37 peoplewere killed in the raids.</TEXT></DOC>
