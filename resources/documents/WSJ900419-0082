Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., helped by cost-cutting, reported an11% rise in first-quarter net income. American Express Co.'sShearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. subsidiary had a $915million loss, a securities industry record, after postingpreviously predicted one-time charges of $787 million.</LP><TEXT>   At industry leader Merrill, investment-banking revenueplunged 27% from a year earlier, while No. 2 Shearsonindicated that it had a 25% decline. Both firms were hit bylower stock and bond underwriting, slumping junk-bond pricesand the ensuing drop in takeover activity.   Separately, Charles Schwab Corp., parent of the discountbrokerage firm, reported a 7.5% decline in first-quarter net.   Merrill's top officers were cautious about the outlook fora pickup in the investment-banking sector.   &quot;Will it rebound to 1988 levels? No, that's probably notin the cards,&quot; said Daniel P. Tully, Merrill president andchief operating officer. Mr. Tully said that the slump allowsthe firm to &quot;lay the groundwork&quot; for a future upturn, butthat &quot;getting back to '88 is going to take some time.&quot;   Merrill, which previously indicated it would lay off asmany as 3,000 of its 41,000 employees, has let go 1,600 sofar, including investment bankers. Many of the remaining1,400 or so may be dismissed in the current quarter andinvestment bankers will be among those idled, Merrillofficials said.   Although Merrill will continue to cut costs the rest ofthe year, officials said they don't expect anotherretrenchment charge such as the $470 million Merrill took inthe fourth quarter.   One reason investment bankers are being shown the door:Much of their business depends on the health of the $200billion public market for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds,which shows few signs of rebounding. Investment-banking firmsrely heavily on the fat fees associated with mergers andacquisitions, which in recent years have been financedlargely by junk bonds.   Merrill's investment-banking revenue declined in the firstquarter to $182.7 million from $249.2 million. Shearson'sinvestment-banking revenue fell to $162 million from $216million.   For the first quarter, Merrill posted net of $41.3 milion,or 34 cents a share, up from $37.2 million, or 31 cents ashare, a year earlier. The year-earlier period included again of $1.7 million, or two cents a share, from discontinuedoperations. Profit from ongoing lines rose 16%. Revenue fell4.7%, to $2.66 billion from $2.80 billion.   The quarterly results were bolstered by a continuedincrease in customer assets under management, to nearly $104billion from $83 billion. Merrill's asset-management andcustodial fee revenue jumped 19%, to $170.1 million from $143million. Managing mutual-fund assets generates fees based onthe amount of assets under management; those fees continue torush in even in poor markets.   Merrill and other firms hope to make money selling stocksto individuals once investors return in large numbers to thestock market. Merrill says only 22% of the assets it managesfor investors are in the stock market. &quot;The {potential}buying power there is just awesome,&quot; says William A.Schreyer, Merrill chairman and chief executive officer.   Merrill insists that its huge &quot;retail,&quot; orindividual-investor brokerage, network of 12,000 brokers willposition the firm to one day take advantage of resumedsmall-investor interest. The retail business might not turnaround this quarter or next, says Mr. Tully, &quot;but as sure asGod made little apples, this business will grow.&quot;   Messrs. Schreyer and Tully said the firm's cost-cuttingefforts are starting to bear fruit. Merrill's expenses of$2.6 billion were down 5% from $2.73 billion a year earlier.Among other things, Merrill managed an 8.5% cut in officesupplies and postage, to $36.5 million.   Because of their new cost-cutting bent, Merrill officialssaid they aren't any longer focusing on being No. 1 in everybusiness. Still, they pointed with pride in a news releasethat the firm maintained its No. 1 ranking in U.S. and globalunderwriting for the quarter. Said Mr. Tully: &quot;We are goingfor profitable market share. If it turns out we're No. 1, sobe it. But we're not going for market share for marketshare's sake.&quot;   Analysts still wonder how fast Merrill can turn itselfaround. &quot;I'm not totally convinced quite yet; the next threequarters will give us a better idea&quot; of how Merrill's bigcost-cutting program is working, said Diana Keat, an analystat Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.   Merrill stock fell 75 cents to $23.125 yesterday in aslumping stock market. Shearson, which reported its lossafter the market closed, fell 37.5 cents to $13.50.   Overall, Wall Street's earnings picture remains dim. Mostmajor firms, aside from Salomon Inc., are expected to postmediocre results. The two big publicly traded firms that havemanaged to post gains, Merrill and PaineWebber Group Inc. (up17%), have done so largely because the comparableyear-earlier results were so bad, analysts say.   Shearson, aside from its one-time charges, had operatinglosses of $128 million, resulting mainly from &quot;a markedslowdown in overall business activity.&quot; Revenue decreased 15%to $2.6 billion from $3 billion.   Shearson's assets under management declined to $92.8billion from $99.8 billion. Shearson said the declinereflects the sale of part of its Boston Co. money-managementbusiness and related divestitures.   Even though Shearson announced a massive cost-cuttingprogram in late February, it said that first-quarter expensesrose 9%, to $3.3 billion from $3 billion. Expenses included arestructuring charge of $630 million. Shearson said itscost-cutting drive, when fully implemented, will save itabout $400 million annually.   Charles Schwab's first-quarter net income fell to $3.7million, or 14 cents a share, from $4 million, or 15 cents ashare, a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
