Present waste-loadallocations for toxicants generally rely on simple dilution calculationsfor low stream-flow conditions. This paper examines the new water qualitycriteria for toxicants and the modeling strategies used to implementthe criteria. The new criteria specify an acute threshold concentrationand a chronic-no-effect concentration for each toxicant as well as tolerabledurations and frequencies of exposure at or above the two concentrations.Methods for using steady-state and dynamic models to derive waste-loadallocations based on the new criteria are reviewed. Physical, chemical,and biological processes affecting toxicants in the mixing zone and far-fieldregimes of streams are summarized.</TEXT></DOC>
