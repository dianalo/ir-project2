The concept was industrial quality, which presupposes that youoffer a customer the very best you can produce because that, andnothing less, is what the customer expects.   In concept or practice it wasn't new. Americans had learned thetrick years before, and its authorities on the subject were quitewilling to share their ideas. A flock of them trekked to Japan; theJapanese listened and improved.   Now, one of the great authorities on the subject, ArmandFeigenbaum, former manager of General Electric's worldwidemanufacturing operations, has finished offering a revolutionaryidea to the Soviets.   The notion: The customer is always right. And what the customerwants, needs, demands is quality.   On reading that advice, most people consider it too obvious forcomment. But the fact of the matter is that it isn't at all.   Time after time companies have fallen on bad times because theyforget it. Repeatedly, companies have resurrected themselves onrediscovering it. And not just companies but entire nations, aswitness the Japanese.   The notion was all but lost in the labyrinthic Soviet productionsystem, which for decades has emphasized production goals overcustomer needs, and thereby affirmed one of Feigenbaum's basicno-nos, to wit:   ``The wrong way is for the manufacturer of a product or theprovider of a service to satisfy his own perceived internal needsat the expense of the customer's requirements.''   The message was delivered last month to an audience at the 32ndannual conference of the European Organization for Quality Control,made up mostly of Russians bent on improving Soviet production andexport prowess.   Will the Russians take heed as the Japanese did? And as much tothe point: Will Americans remain competitive by practicing qualitycontrol; or will they forget, as they did for 20 years or so priorto the 1980s.   Feigenbaum, author of ``Total Quality Control,'' a bible on thesubject, is now president of General Systems Co., a Pittsfield,Mass., company that installs quality control systems throughout theworld.   These are some of the points he made to the Russians, and whichhe suggests might draw the attention of American producers ofproducts and services:   _Quality is everybody's job but it will become nobody's jobunless management provides operating systems that support the workof individuals and promote teamwork among individuals anddepartments.   _Quality and cost are partners, not adversaries. The essence ofboth higher quality and lower costs is fully effective use ofresources. Anything less produces waste, which means higher costs.   _Automation is no substitute for quality. Unless installed as anintegrated part of an overall quality system, automation merelyproduces the same bad products faster.   _Quality is not just a technical function or department. It isan operating system that extends throughout the organization andprovides the social stability and economic efficiency essential toquality.   _Quality improvement doesn't come through sloganeering, bumperstickers, occasional quality fireworks called campaigns, or thedusting off of a few traditional quality-control techniques.   Customers perceive quality and they relate it to price. Qualityshows through, he says, and when it isn't there it doesn't takelong for the customer to know it ... in Japan, the United States orthe Soviet Union.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Fri July 8</NOTE></DOC>
