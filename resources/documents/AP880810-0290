(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As developments change the way peoplecommunicate _ from cellular phones to interactive cable TV _ someregulators and lawmakers say the Constitution's protections oftraditional speech and press need to be restated for the new media.   Police can legally eavesdrop on cellular telephoneconversations, even though it would be unlawful to tap the sameconversations over regular phone lines without a court order, saidUCLA communication studies Professor Jeff Cole.   It's also legal to spy on the phone numbers dialed up by a homecomputer.   And here in Cerritos, people are frustrated by anotherconstititional quandary. They can't receive a futuristic cablesystem that would provide at-home shopping and banking, not tomention lots of television channels, until it's determined who hasa right to install it.   ``We are going to have to figure out a way to ensure the FirstAmendment survives the technological revolution,'' said FederalCommunications Commission public affairs director John Kamp.   In the Cerritos case, an official of the FCC _ which regulatesbroadcast media and some telephone services but not newspapers andmagazines _ recently approved the laying of cable by the localtelephone company, GTE, which won a contract from the city lastyear.   But cable industry groups have asked the full FCC to review thematter and a decision is expected in the fall, said Michael Morrisof the California Cable Television Association. The industry citesfederal regulations banning telephone companies from operatingcable TV in cities where they run the phones.   ``The residents are frustrated,'' said Michele Ogle, aspokeswoman for this upscale Los Angeles suburb. ``They would liketo see cable teleision. The surrounding communities have it.''   Some media experts are concerned for a different reason. Theythink the First Amendment, guaranteeing free speech and press,should keep local and federal governments from deciding who sendsor receives information by the new media.   ``The phone companies, like any other citizen, enjoy a FirstAmendment right to be speakers,'' said Patrick Maines of The MediaInstitute in Washington, D.C.   Cable television should have ``little or no regulation at thefederal or local level,'' he said.   Maines' institute houses the First Amendment Center on the NewMedia, which has filed legal briefs and comments with courts andthe FCC in eight cases it feels threaten the First Amendment rightsof new media such as cable television, telephone informationservices and electronic publishing.   Cole of UCLA compared the state of law and the new media to``the Old West where there's no established law and order, anythinggoes, and the biggest guy with the most power always wins.''   Some argue that the First Amendment is meant to ensure manymedia voices and that government rules encouraging competitionamong new media help meet that goal, he said.   Letting telephone companies offer electronic information ontheir wires could give them an unfair advantage over potentialcompetitors, according to former FCC general counsel Henry Geller,now head of the Washington Center for Public Policy Research.   ``I don't want the phone company to be in cable television andcontrol 50 channels,'' Geller said.   Future fiber optic transmission lines, which GTE would test inCerritos, could become a ``highway into the home'' carryingtelephone, television, and text messages, he said.   Today's new media blur the lines between categories lawmakersand judges have used for years.   The First Amendment was written more than 200 years ago, whenprint was the only mass medium. The nation's communication act waspassed in 1934, when radio and telephone concerns dominated.   ``It used to be easy to tell the difference between newspapersand telephones. Now it's not so easy,'' said the FCC's Kamp. Somenewspapers send electronic copies of stories to home computers overphone lines.   ``I see no difference between the Washington Post I pick up atmy doorstep and the Washington Post that comes in on my computermodem, except that I don't get newsprint ink on my hands,'' saidKen Allen of the Information Industry Association, a group of 650companies ``that see information as their product.''   ``They (new media) should have the same protections that theFirst Amendment provides other information sources,'' said Allen.But he cited cases ``where information that is put in a new mediasuddenly loses all of its (First Amendment) protections.''   California's Legislature this year considered a stateconstitutional amendment extending state free speech and pressprotections to computer communications. The bill passed the stateAssembly but was stalled in the Senate after law enforcement andcredit information companies voiced opposition, said Bob Jacobson,a consultant to the Assembly committee.   ``I think the likelihood of all forms of communication havingfull First Amendment rights is the most likely course over time,''said Everette Dennis of the Gannett Center for Media Studies in NewYork. ``It may take a long time to happen. But it's aninevitability.''</TEXT></DOC>
