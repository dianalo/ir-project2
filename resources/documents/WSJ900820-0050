Arunasalam's grandmother hadsome advice for him when he began working for FurukawaElectric Co.'s Malaysian subsidiary in 1972. &quot;You have to bevery careful about the Japanese,&quot; she warned.   She was speaking from experience, albeit dated. Herhusband was among the thousands of ethnic Tamils, mostlyrubber plantation workers, who were rounded up by Japaneseoccupation forces during World War II and forced to work onthe Siam-Burma railway, better known as the Death Railway.</LP><TEXT>   Her husband, like tens of thousands of other Malaysiansand prisoners of war, would die building the railway. Mr.Arunasalam says those who survived told his grandmother thather husband, a devout Hindu, refused to eat the rotten beefoffered by his Japanese army overseers. &quot;So they beat andbayonetted him, and left him dying for three days&quot; along thebanks of the River Kwai, he recounts.   This sort of tale is common in Southeast Asia, whereJapan's military and economic expansion 50 years ago left anindelible mark. Memories of the war are keen here. Butconversations with Malaysian workers also suggest thatSoutheast Asians have largely come to terms with history --and the growing number of Japanese employers in their region.Mr. Arunasalam, for one, spent 17 years at Furukawa and wasthankful for his job.   Clearly there is still suspicion and resentment of Japan.Recently, the Malaysian foreign minister expressed hisconcern that Japan may fill the void left behind by cuts inU.S. and Soviet military operations in the region. Hiscomments created a diplomatic stir.   Yet there is also admiration for the Japanese,particularly among younger Malaysians who see in Japan aneconomic machine that has invested billions in Southeast Asiaand helped transform subsistence agrarian economies intobustling industrial enclaves. With that investment have comejobs, a rising living standard and an inclination to look toJapan as an economic role model.   &quot;My parents suffered during the Japanese time,&quot; saysManickan Thagarajan, who makes semiconductors at NEC Corp.'splant near here, &quot;but these days they never much worry aboutthe old time.&quot;   In the early 1980s, Malaysian Prime Minister MahathirMohamad even initiated a &quot;Look East&quot; policy, and decided thatthe Malaysian economy could gain from studying at Japan'sknee. Mr. Mahathir, who lived through the Japanese occupationand was forced to hawk bananas to help support his family,found many of his countrymen baffled when he announced hisprogram. His critics worried it would benefit Japanese farmore than Malaysians.   But the Look East policy caught hold. Initially aimed atinculcating Japan's work ethic in Malaysia, it soon led to anational desire for things Japanese, and to a major expansionof Japanese investment here.   In recent years, Japan has been the biggest foreign sourceof manufacturing investment in Malaysia. In 1989 alone,Japanese companies invested about $1 billion in the country,according to the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority.   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. was one of the first tocome, arriving in the mid-1960s. Today it has 11 Malaysianplants employing 11,000 workers.   Those workers often complain about management's insistenceon high production targets and demands for overtime work. Buttheir jobs are more secure than most, and they include plentyof interaction between the executive suite and the shopfloor.   &quot;Employees can suggest anything from A to Z,&quot; says AbdulManab Mohamed Kassim, president of the Electrical IndustryWorkers' Union and a longtime employee of MatsushitaElectric. The company, he says, has set up suggestioncommittees and quality circles and pays attention to minorpersonnel matters, such as announcing employee birthdays, ina way that bolsters worker morale. &quot;These days,&quot; Mr. Manabadds, &quot;if managers are disliked by employees, they often aresent back&quot; to Japan.   Malaysian workers, however, echo the complaints ofgovernments throughout the region that Japanese companies,more than others, restrict the transfer of technology tosubsidiaries in Southeast Asia and lag behind in buildingresearch and development facilities in the region.   &quot;I worked for a cable company for 17 years,&quot; says Mr.Arunasalam, who made electric and telephone cables forFurukawa before leaving to take a union post. &quot;But I can'ttell you how a cable is made from start to finish.&quot;   When he went to Japan in 1980 to visit Furukawa's Tokyoheadquarters he was barred from entering one of its plants,he says. &quot;The plant was working on optic fibers. And I wastold that it was top secret, even for someone like me, whohad been with the company for so many years.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;Guiding Hand: In Asia, the JapaneseHope to `Coordinate' What Nations Produce --- They UseInvestment and Aid To Determine Who Makes TVs and Who MakesToys --- Nicer Co-Prosperity Sphere?&quot; -- WSJ August 20, 1990)</TEXT></DOC>
