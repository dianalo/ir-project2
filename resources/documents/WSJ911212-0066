The proposals now in dispute, among the 50 outlined in aplan to overhaul the civil justice system that the vicepresident announced last August, would seek to streamline thepretrial fact-finding process known as discovery. Butcorporate defense lawyers say the changes would force them toturn over too much information to anyone who files a lawsuitagainst their clients and could result in the disclosure ofcorporate secrets to competitors.</LP><TEXT>   The opposition has been directed specifically atalready-pending amendments to the Federal Rules of CivilProcedure, amendments that are virtually identical to thoseproposed by Dan Quayle. Any such changes would have to beapproved by the Judicial Conference of the U.S., theadministrative arm of the federal courts, and then by theU.S. Supreme Court.   Under the Quayle proposals, each party in a lawsuit wouldbe required to give the other side the names and addresses ofall persons with relevant information about a case anddisclose the location of all pertinent documents. Refusals tocomply would be grounds for barring the offending party fromobtaining additional information.   Another proposed change would limit the number of formalinterviews, known as depositions, and the number of writteninterrogatories that either side could demand, unless a judgeagreed to an extension. Litigants would be free to exceed anylimits but would have to assume all the costs of producingthe information.   Both proposals are aimed at cutting the excessive cost andlong delays frequently encountered by litigants in the earlystages of lawsuits. Far from speeding the process by helpingopposing parties gather useful information, discovery in itscurrent form oftens serves to intimidate opponents withunreasonable document demands, exhausting pretrial testimonyand unnecessary requests for information.   &quot;One corporate counsel told us that discovery {abuse} is80% of the problem&quot; with civil litigation, Mr. Quayle saidlast August, pointing the finger at lawyers for plaintiffswho allegedly engaged in abusive discovery practices.&quot;Unnecessary document requests and depositions can disrupt orput on hold a company's entire research and developmentprogram,&quot; he said.   But so far, much of the organized opposition to Mr.Quayle's proposals is coming from lawyers who defendcorporations, rather than from the lawyers who sue them. Thelawyers have mounted their campaign through a coalitioncalled Lawyers for Civil Justice, which includes counsel fora large number of companies, including Ford Motor Co.,Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co., Exxon Corp. and AetnaLife andamp; Casualty Co.   What final form Mr. Quayle's proposed changes will takewon't be known until after the U.S. Department of Justicecompletes a final draft of all its reform proposals laterthis month. The Justice Department hasn't decided how it willcoordinate the Quayle proposals with those already pendingbefore the Judicial Conference.   Defense lawyers say they oppose voluntary disclosure ofwitnesses and documents because it would entitle plaintiffs'lawyers to free information merely by filing a lawsuit. &quot;Acleverly drafted complaint could force a commercial rival,for example, to disclose otherwise unobtainable information&quot;without formulating a formal request for discovery, Edward W.Mullins Jr., president of Lawyers for Civil Justice, wrote tothe Judicial Conference of the U.S. last month, urgingrejection of the rules amendments.   Moreover, the language defining what &quot;core information&quot;should be turned over to the opponent is so vague thatdefendants risk disclosing too much in an effort to comply orincurring strict penalties for not disclosing enough. Ineither case, the proposed rule would interfere with thetraditional attorney-client relationship, according to thelawyers group.   &quot;Clients do not expect their own attorney to vigorouslyroot through their files to find self-destructiveinformation, only to dutifully turn it over to the client'sadversary,&quot; wrote Mr. Mullins.   Worst of all, says Alfred W. Cortese Jr., a corporatedefense lawyer in Washington, D.C., and a member of Lawyersfor Civil Justice, the rules amendments would increaselitigation costs and delays, rather than reduce them.   The lawyers group also is opposing any limits on thetaking of depositions. While Mr. Quayle's proposal does notspecify precise limits on such interviews, the rule changesnow under review by the Judicial Conference would limitdepositions to 10 per side, lasting six hours each. Bothplaintiffs and defense lawyers complain that such a limit istoo low to accommodate complex cases with multiple defendantsand numerous legal issues.   Plaintiffs' lawyers are more divided over whether tooppose the pending recommendations. The Association of TrialLawyers of America, the national lobbying group forpersonal-injury and product-liability attorneys based inWashington, has taken no formal position on any of theproposals.   But plaintiffs' lawyers, while generally in favor of rulesthat would speed up the discovery process, share the defenselawyers' concern about mandatory disclosure of &quot;coreinformation,&quot; says Barry Nace, vice president of the triallawyers group and a medical malpractice and personal injurylawyer in Washington, D.C.   Malpractice lawyers in particular rely on tips fromdoctors who frequently report instances of suspectedmalpractice by fellow physicians while insisting onconfidentiality. &quot;If I've got to disclose them, that's theend of that,&quot; says Mr. Nace. Limits on depositions and thenumber of requests for information that can be filed also arenot likely to be embraced by plaintiffs' lawyers, says Mr.Nace.   An advisory committee to the Judicial Conference held apublic hearing on the pending rules amendments in Los Angeleslast month, and another is scheduled in Atlanta in February.No final recommendation to the Supreme Court on the proposedchanges is expected until late next year.</TEXT></DOC>
