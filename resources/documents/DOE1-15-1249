The material parameters for this model are derived fromhydrostatic consolidation tests performed on wet salt taken from theWaste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico. The constitutivemodel is then used for analyses of the interaction between intact andcrushed salt in realistic field configurations such as backfilled andopen shafts and drifts. The calculations are used to show that the wetcrushed salt does not significantly retard the rate of closure of shaftsand drifts until the crushed salt is consolidated to approximately 95%of intact salt density. An approximate method for modeling the creeprate of intact salt is developed which more closely matches the closuredata from empty drifts at the WIPP site in order to provide a more realisticestimate of the crushed salt response. 24 refs., 34 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
