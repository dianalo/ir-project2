 Inother words, ASAI is ATandamp;Ts OAI.andM;ASAI allows a two-way interactive dialogue between the computer's applicationsoftware and the PBX's call processing software.andP;  This capability integratestelephony and data services, providing a set of &quot;building blocks&quot; forapplications.andP;  ASAI has been billed as being both &quot;ISDN-based&quot; and&quot;OSI-consistent.&quot; The company has even put together the ISDN/DMI User'sGroup, an organization of 168 companies to develop PBX-to-computerapplications.andM;Although ATandamp;T has &quot;published&quot; the specs for ASAI, the interface is not yetavailable.andP;  As a result, there are - as of today no working applications withany of the ASAI strategic partners discussed below.andP;  Here's what they have ontheir drawing boards.andM;ATandamp;T and IBM recently announced that they would jointly develop an interfacelinking ASAI to IBM's CallPath Services Architecture.andP;  Me partners will useexisting ATandamp;T products - the ISDN Gateway and the Integrated TelemarketingGateway - to integrate Definity 85 PBXs or PBX/ACDs with IBM computers.andO;Simultaneous delivery of a customer's account information along with his callis just one of the applications in the works.andM;Other agreements have been forged with: Stratus Computers, to ensurecompatibility between Definities and Stratus XA 2000 Continuous ProcessingSystems; and Tandem, to develop an interface to Tandem Nonstop computers.andM;ATandamp;T VAR Short List:andM;Tandem ComputersandM;Cupertino, CAandM;408-725-7574andM;Stratus ComputerandM;Marlborough, MAandM;508-460-2796andM;Digital Equipment CorpandM;Maynard, MAandM;508-474-6392andM;IBMandM;White Plains, NYandM;914-642-4628andM;HenriksonandM;Henriksen (Broomfield, CO) equipped its PBXtra with a computer-controlledinterface, allowing VARs to attach their own computers and completely controlthe switch.andP;  Ring detect, on-hook/off-hook and other PBX data can be relayedto the host computer.andP;  In addition, the host may sendcomputer-control-interface connection-and-disconnection instructions to thePBXtra.andP;  The interface is compatible with PCs, minis, micros and mainframes.andM;&quot;We opened up the PBXtra in the fall of 1989,&quot; says Bud Henriksen.andP;  We saw ademand from VARs who had a market segment carved out already.andP;  All theyneeded was a switch that could accommodate them.andM;&quot;The first deal we did was in the predictive dialing sector, which is wheremost of the requests were coming from,&quot; relates Bud.andP;  &quot;Used in outboundtelemarketing applications, predictive dialing computers (PDCs) automaticallydial a database of phone numbers.andP;  Voice recognition boards identify anyresponses.andP;  PDCs save agents the trouble of calling prospects themselves andwaiting for them to pick up the phone.&quot;andM;It is essential that the PDC respond to any answered calls immediately, orthe called party will hang up.andP;  When harnessed to a PBXtra, the PDC canconnect to a free agent in less than 100 milliseconds.andP;  The agent receivesaccount record on the screen along with the call.andP;  The PBXtra can work withpredictive dialing computers by TeleSystems Source.andM;They also have a VAR agreement with US Tel, for alternate operator services,and with Paradise Technology, for custom voice processing applications forthe legal profession and automated entry systems.andM;Interested VARs should contact Henriksen with a description of their marketrequirements.andM;VAR Short List:andM;TeleSystemsandM;Fairfax, VAandM;703-273-4991andM;US TelandM;Reno, NVandM;702-322-4468andM;Paradise TechnologyandM;Kailua-Kona, HIandM;808-326-9556andM;HitachiandM;Hitachi (Norcross, GA) is currently developing a true open applicationsinterface to be announced later this year.andP;  However, they have alreadyachieved some interactive property-management integration for their HCX 5000family of PBXs.andP;  Many of these applications involve a two-way data transferbetween PBX and applications processor.andP;  Chuck Kaplan, manager of systemsengineering at Hitachi, tells us about what they have now.andM;Property Management Systems (PMS) have been developed by EECO, Encore andCLS, and over 20 other VARs.andP;  Geared for the lodging industry, these systemscan send the following types of messages to the HCX 5000:andM;* Check-in/check-out.andP;  A guest walks up to the front desk and checks in.andP;  Thedesk clerk types the relevant check-in data into a PMS terminal.andP;  The PMSthen sends a message to the HCX, across the link, that the room is nowoccupied and all restrictions should be lifted from the guest's phone.andP;  Whenthe guest checks out, the PMS sends a message that telecom vacancyrestrictions are to be reinstated.andM;* Directory name.andP;  After a guest checks in, the PMS will send her name to theHCX.andP;  When a guest calls the operator or room service, her name will appearon the console.andP;  Staff members can then answer her calls with a personalgreeting.andM;* Message waiting.andP;  When someone leaves a message for a guest at the frontdesk, the clerk will enter it on the PMS console.andP;  The system then sends amessage across the link, telling the HCX to turn on the guest's messagewaiting light.andP;  The HCX can also send information back to the propertymanagement system.andP;  The following commands are the most typical:andM;* Call charges.andP;  The PMS keeps a folio - a list of all customer charges.andO;After a guest has completed a call, the HCX will send toll information to thePMS.andM;Message waiting.andP;  Many hotels have television screens posting messages in thelobby.andP;  Or they'll have an LED message board in back of the front desk.andP;  Ifthe HCX attendant has turned on a message waiting light, the switch can senda message to the PMS to activate these extra-telecom facilities.andM;Boston Technologies, a Dialogic VAR, VMX and Centigram have released voicemessaging systems for use with the HCX.andP;  These systems also involve a two-waydata transfer between switch and AP.andM;VAR Short List:andM;Boston TechnologiesandM;Boston, MAandM;617-225-0500andM;VMXandM;San Jose, CAandM;408-942-6604andM;CentigramandM;San Jose, CAandM;408-578-0506andM;EncoreandM;Atlanta, GAandM;404-434-3500andM;CLSandM;Long Beach, CAandM;213-988-1100andM;InteComandM;InteCom (Allen, TX) was the first PBX vendor to release an Open ApplicationInterface, way back at the 1987 ICA show.andP;  They now have OAI on their IBXline - models S/10, S/80 and S/80+ - as well as the new mid-sized Telari.andO;Their OAI interfaces are compatible with PCs, minis, micros and mainframes.andM;The company has formed an application-development group dedicated todeveloping OAI applications.andP;  An OAI test laboratory has an IBX, Telari,multiple PCs, a VAX 3100 and a VAX 3300.andP;  It is available to VARs andcustomers for applications development and testing, either in-house or viadial-up links.andP;  To date, InteCom has developed a Data Security Administrationpackage and an ACD Supervisor Terminal Expansion system.andM;InteCom's VAR liaison program is run by Denise Hodgson, their OAI applicationconsultant.andP;  She works with software writers, furnishing them with toolkits,documentation, application definition, integration strategy and testingfacilities.andM;Mere are no licensing requirements for OAI.andP;  However, InteCom requires andfurnishes test facilities for verification and certification of a VAR'scommunication link software if the VAR is not using an InteComdevelopedtoolkit.andM;Here is a brief summary of what InteCom's VARs have accomplished to date.andM;Amcom Corp integrated their message center to provide message waitingindication for InteCom's PBXs.andP;  Their package also allows intended ones toprint or display messages using OAI feature buttons or dial feature codes.andO;These messages can appear on any of InteCom's display phones or on any othertype of ITE set with a Digital Techniques add-on display unit.andP;  In addition,Amcom can monitor various electronic mail packages and provides messagewaiting for E-mail users.andM;Compco integrated various modules of their Telecommunication ManagementSystem.andP;  A Directory/Message Center, Emergency 911 and ACD Report Writer haveall been linked via OAI.andP;  Compco is currently working with InteCom to developthe latter's Ultra ACD software package, slated for fourth quarter, 1990.andM;Symon, by Applied Micros, is a PC-based package which monitors telephonesystems for alarm and ACD exception conditions.andP;  Messages are displayed on alarge remote display unit based on system conditions.andP;  Symon uses OAI toextract ACD statistical data from an IBX.andM;StarTel's Message System integrates to provide message waiting indication.andO;Digital Techniques developed a Checkmate dial-in security package, using OAIto secure access to host computers.andP;  A strategic alliance with Wang yieldedthe STEP version 2.0.andM;InteCom may be acquired soon by a company called Matra Communications, whichmakes PBXs in France.andP;  It seems to be interested in allowing InteCom topursue Open Architecture.andP;  But, as of this writing, the acquisition deal isrunning months late.andM;VAR Short List:andM;Amcom CorpandM;Minneapolis, MNandM;612-829-7445andM;CompcoandM;Nashville, TNandM;615-373-3636andM;StarTelandM;Irvine, CAandM;714-863-8700andM;Applied MicrosandM;SugarLand,TXandM;713-240-5555andM;Digital TechniquesandM;Allen, TXandM;214-727-1200andM;MitelandM;Mitel (Boca Raton, FL) introduced Host Command Interface (HCI) for theirSX-2000 and SX-2000 PBXs.andP;  HCI is compatible with PCs, minis, micros andmainframes.andM;They don't have anything for their small switches.andP;  And Mitel hasaggressively ceased doing any Randamp;D on its analog switches, like the verypopular SX-200 which TELECONNECT owns two of.andP;  Some outsiders have offeredassistance on opening the SX-200 family to third party VARs.andP;  And there'ssome continuing, and slow, discussion.andM;Leo Lax, systems vice president/marketing, had this to say about HCI: &quot;In thenear future, no single company will be able to service all needs of aparticular customer.andP;  Successful companies will be able to provideintegration towards a total system solution.&quot;andM;Like practically every other player in the PBX world, Mitel has entered intoan agreement with Digital Equipment Corp to develop their HCI.andP;  In Canada,the company has worked with DEC and AGT, Alberta's provincial telecomsupplier, to supply long distance call information to hotels and motels.andM;Mitel demonstrated their first working HCI applications at this year's ICAshow.andP;  Geared for shared tenant environments, this application enables theoperator to answer callers with the name of the company or person they aretrying to reach.andM;They also had on hand an inbound/outbound telemarketing application writtenby NPRI.andP;  This package queues up the appropriate database file on a productor customer along with a call.andP;  The agent is then given a prefab screen toplace orders, filled in with as much information as is automaticallyavailable from a switch.andM;A national customer-service application allows an incoming call to be routedto particular agent responsible for a particular geographic region.andP;  Callscan be transferred internally along with the database file, so a new agentcan pick up where the old one has left off.andM;Mitel says it will provide tool kits to qualified customers, so they cantailor applications to meet their specific needs.andM;NECandM;NEC (Melville, NY) officially announced their OAI at this year's ICA show.andO;They also had on hand their integrated ACD, made possible by OAI.andP;  Theinterface is currently available on the NEAX2400 IMS family, including theSIM, IMG, MMG and UMG editions.andM;Simply put, NEC's OAI is a communication interface that connects the NEAX2400to a general purpose computer.andP;  It allows the company's Dterm electronicphone sets to talk to the computer, even when users are on the phone.andP;  Thecomputer can respond by transmitting data either to displays on Dterm phones,PCs or terminals connected to the Dterms.andM;The interface comes with a library of programs for the computer, whichessentially translate standard programming instructions into commandsrecognizable to the NEAX2400 processor.andP;  VARs can thus write applicationprograms in a more or less familiar format, without referring to intricatecommunications protocols.andP;  Ready-made programs are also available.andM;NEC's OAI Concept Manual outlines a number of sample applications.andP;  Freelocation numbering allows you to transfer calls to the nearest phone simplyby entering a personal ID at the desired telephone.andP;  This saves you fromtrudging back to your own desk every time you get caught up on another floor.andM;An expanded authorization code application lets you use the computer databaseto add more codes or expand code verification parameters on the NEAX2400.andO;Also available are caller and called name display features and the selectiverestriction of PBX features at sensitive times of the day.andM;NEC's OAI conforms to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) modelestablished by the International Standards Organization (ISO).andP;  As a result,it is compatible with most vendors' computer systems.andM;When licensing VARs, NEC looks for a vertical market strategy.andP;  They alsoassess the types of applications the VAR can offer.andP;  Lastly, they requirecompatibility testing for computers and software.andM;Amcom, which crafts UNIX-based applications for the hotel and hospitalmarkets, developed a message center using NEC's OAI.andP;  Users can reviewmessages taken by a live operator on their Dterm sets.andP;  Hotel and hospitalpackages are currently on the drawing board.andM;NEC also has a VAR agreement with Encore Systems.andP;  The two companies arediscussing applications geared for lodging establishments.andP;  The result willbe &quot;the hotel of the future,&quot; according to NEC's Ron Schiller.andM;Lastly, Bell South Communications, a flagship distributor for the NEAX2400product, has entered into a joint marketing and development agreement forNEC's OAI.andP;

 HP's Applied Computerized Telephony call-processingserver and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) connect the HP 3000 and9000 computers with Northern PBXs.andP;  The call-processing API for the HP 9000has been touted as &quot;the first available UNIX system-based solution.&quot;andM;To connect with HP hardware, Northern Telecom has developed an IntegratedServices Digital Network  Applications  Protocol (ISDN/AP) on their Meridianfamily.andP;  ISDN/AP is an intelligent software link integrating traditionaloffice automation or data processing applications with Meridian PBXs.andP;  Itenables an application processor to interact with the telecom switch to makeboth voice and data calls.andM;ISDN/AP can also work with DEC VAX computers.andP;  The combined platform has beenused for information access, management, manipulation, storage and retrieval.andO;Integrated message centers, simultaneous call and file transfer and callscreening have also been achieved.andM;Northern has left it to their computer partners to conduct developers' forumsand provide other support to VARs.andP;

 Previously, CallPath was compatible onlywith switches.andM;Suggested uses for CallPath include order processing, lead generation orclaims inquiry.andP;  CallPath applications can also implement simultaneousdelivery of a customer's phone call and his data file.andM;CallPath Services Architecture will support standards currently underdevelopment by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and theEuropean Computer Manufacturer's Association (ECMA).andM;IBM has also announced CallPath/400 software, which implements CallPatharchitecture on the IBM Applications System/400.andP;  The program will supportboth inbound and outbound telemarketing applications, including catalogsales, emergency dispatch, fund-raising and market research.andP;  CallPath shouldbe available in March, 1991 and will cost anywhere from $3,900 to $27,300.andM;Information Management Associates (Trumbull, CT) has developed TELEMAR, atelemarketing and sales application employing CallPath/400 software.andP;  DynamicCommunication (Denver, Colorado) has written the DCI Telemark System Version2.5, which uses CallPath/400 to collect and manage call information.andM;If you'd like more on IBM's CallPath plans, drop a self-addressed label toRose Bodin at TELECONNECT.andP;  She'll send you an IBM CallPath supplement wejust published.andM;FujitsuandM;Fujitsu's OMNI PBX family has met compatibility standards for use with ATandamp;T'sNetwork ISDN Primary Rate Interface (PRI).andP;  Both the OMNI SI and OMNI SIIIwill be able to harness ISDN features when the blessed time comes.andM;For the time being, PRI compatibility translates to support of automaticnumber identification  (ANI)  services, expanding the OMNI's potential incall center environments.andP;  Another perk is compatibility with SoftwareDefined Network (SDN), which enables the OMNI to tie into an interexchangecarrier's virtual network.andP;  Virtual networking can replace dedicated leasedlines and costs as much as 30% less than conventional long distance services.andM;Although the OMNI clan was introduced back in 1983, both the OMNI SI and SIIIcan easily be upgraded to state-of-the-art PBXs, thanks to Fujitsu's &quot;noobsolescence&quot; policyandM;Handamp;KandM;Handamp;K (Mountain View, CA) has developed a key-system application for smallbusinesses.andP;  Running on a PC, this program furnishes full key systemfeatures, including a full duplex programmable speaker phone, programmablemacro buttons, pink-pad messaging with auto dial-back, a speed-dialingdirectory and preset dialing with editing and toll restriction.andM;All phones and COs are interconnected on one pair, which can be bussed,bridged, tapped and strung over 5,000 feet.andP;  The PC can be connected anywhereon this pair.andP;  All power for the phones and CO interface cards is centrallylocated in the COBOX and placed on the single pair.andM;You program the system via lotus-type menus.andP;  Software maintenance andupgrades are furnished on floppy disk.andM;Available in October of this year, Handamp;K's PC-based system promises to be thefirst truly open&quot; telephone system for small businesses.andM;ADDRESSESandM;ATandamp;TandM;Parsippany, NJandM;201-581-5600andM;Harmony SystemsandM;San Diego, CAandM;619-536-8180andM;HenriksenandM;Broomfield, COandM;303-425-9303andM;Hitachi AmericaandM;Norcross, GAandM;404-446-8820andM;InteComandM;Allen, TXandM;214-727-9141andM;MitelandM;Boca Raton, FLandM;407-994-8500andM;NEC AmericaandM;Melville, NYandM;516-753-7000andM;Northern TelecomandM;Richardson, TXandM;800-328-8800andM;Rolm CompanyandM;Norwalk, CTandM;203-849-6000andM;SiemensandM;Boca Raton, FLandM;407-994-5400andM;TadiranandM;Clearwater, FLandM;813-536-3222andM;Telenova (Lexar)andM;Camarillo, CAandM;805-388-5000andM;VPACS(ETE)andM;Long Island City, NYandM;718-482-8484</TEXT></DOC>
