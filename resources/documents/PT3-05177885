Furthermore, use is also made difficult by the complexity of the method of      use (a number of levers, buttons etc.). </PAR><PAR>  There has been known for a short time a rear-entry boot of the type in      question, which has good lateral rigidity and which comprises a rigid      lateral reinforcement saddle in the shape of a U, the two branches of      which are arranged on each lateral face of the shell and are, in the      locked position, oriented in a general direction which is essentially      parallel to that of the tibia, the top of the lateral branches being      connected by a connecting portion in the shape of a gutter, so as to      follow part of the bottom of the leg. In an advantageous embodiment, the      lower free end of the two lateral branches of the saddle is articulated on      the bottom of the rear collar. </PAR><PAR>  The invention relates to a device for closing and for clamping this type of      ski boot with a saddle serving as buckle, which is easy to operate,      reliable, and makes it possible to ensure progressive clamping in one      single movement by means of a simplified cable circuit. </PAR><PAR>  This device for closing and for clamping a ski boot comprises: </PAR><PA1>  a shell which is intended to receive an inner boot, which in turn receives      a foot of the skier, and which comprises a sole and a heel, and which has      in the region of this heel a support ramp; </PA1><PA1>  a collar which is intended to enclose the bottom of the leg, articulated in      relation to the shell and capable of pivoting towards the rear; </PA1><PA1>  a saddle, in the shape of a gutter and serving as buckle, which is      articulated in relation to the collar and arranged in the use position in      a general direction which is essentially parallel to that of the tibia,      following the rear of the collar and surrounding the rear of the bottom of      the leg and the top of the heel. </PA1><PAR>  This ski boot is characterized </PAR><PAR>  in that the collar, which is articulated in the sole of the shell at the      height of the plantar arch, comprises at the rear an articulated lever, in      which a slot is formed, in which there comes to be accommodated and to      slide the end of a rigid arm which is fixed at its end to the rear of the      shell; </PAR><PAR>  in that the saddle articulated on the collar comprises at its lower end a      finger which takes its bearing on the ramp formed in the shell and itself      has another ramp formed inside the connecting portion in the shape of a      gutter; </PAR><PA1>  and lastly in that the assembly comprises a flexible cable connecting the      front of the boot to the free end of the lever, passing, in the collar,      via deflectors. </PA1><PAR>  Thus, during the closing operation, by action on the saddle, the collar      pivots in order to put itself in position by action of the finger sliding      on the ramp. By virtue of the rigid arm connecting shell and lever, the      characteristic lever pivots towards the bottom about its pin, thus keeping      the cable tensioned, and this ensures the closing operation. Continuing      the movement, the lever then comes to take its bearing on the ramp      provided to this end inside the connecting portion of the branches of the      saddle in order thus to be pivoted completely towards the bottom and      towards the front of the shell, which then ensures the clamping of the      bottom of the collar on the bottom of the leg. </PAR><PAR>  Advantageously, in practice: </PAR><PAR>  the ramp formed in the saddle is, when this saddle is in the high position,      known as the use position, inclined towards the bottom and towards the      front of the boot and ends in a hook in which there comes to be      accommodated, in the locked position, the free end of the lever in order      to ensure the self-locking of the assembly and the retention of the      saddle; </PAR><PAR>  in the locked position, the cable passes in front of the articulation pin      of the lever on the collar; </PAR><PAR>  the collar is made in two separate parts, respectively a rear cuff      articulated, as already mentioned, in the sole at the height of the      plantar arch, and a front cuff which is then articulated on this rear      cuff, in front of the malleoli; </PAR><PAR>  the rear articulated cuff comprises two separate portions, respectively a      top portion forming the collar proper and enclosing the bottom of the leg,      connected to a bottom portion which forms a stirrup and encloses the rear      of the heel and which according to a characteristic of the invention is      articulated in the sole. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAR>  The manner in which the invention can be produced and the advantages which      derive therefrom will emerge more clearly from the exemplary embodiment      which follows, supported by the attached figures. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a concise representation in cross-section section of an open      rear-entry ski boot according to the invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a concise exploded representation of the essential parts of the      boot, excluding the specific closing assembly. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a concise representation of this characteristic closing device. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4, 5 and 6 show the boot according to the invention in intermediate      positions, respectively low (FIG. 4), high (FIG. 5), and closed (FIG. 6). </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAR>  The ski boot according to the invention essentially comprises (see FIG. 2): </PAR><PAR>  firstly, a shell made of rigid plastic material and designated by the      general reference (1), which has in order a toe (2), an instep (3), an      indentation (4), a rear face (5) starting at the height (6) of the      calcaneus and a sole (7) which has at the height of the heel, more      precisely in the portion (8) comprised between the plantar arch and the      heel, a ramp (10) formed to begin with by a first gradually increasing      portion (11) connected to a rounded peak (12) forming a high point, then      to a second portion (13), the slope of which is flatter than the first      portion (11). This characteristic ramp (10) is monobloc and is obtained at      the time of moulding of the shell (1) or of the wear piece protecting the      shell. </PAR><PAR>  In known manner, the boot according to the invention comprises an      articulated collar which can pivot towards the rear and is made in two      parts, respectively a front cuff (15), the bottom of the front face (16)      of which is arranged above the instep (3). This front cuff (15) interacts      in known manner with a rear cuff (20) which, according to a characteristic      of the invention, has on either side of the shell (1) an extension      designated by the general reference (21). According to another      characteristic of the invention, the rear cuff (20) is articulated on      either side in the region of its extension (21), and more precisely about      an axis (22) arranged in the sole (7) of the shell at the height of the      plantar arch. </PAR><PAR>  According to a third characteristic of the invention, the front cuff (15)      is articulated at (23) on the extension (21) of the rear cuff (20), this      axis (23) being arranged in front of the malleoli. </PAR><PAR>  The boot also comprises a saddle designated by the general reference (30),      which is articulated on the extension (21) of the rear cuff (20) about an      axis (31) arranged behind the malleoli. According to a characteristic of      the invention, the lower end (32) of each branch (33) of the saddle has on      either side of the shell a finger (34) intended to take its bearing on the      characteristic ramp (10). Moreover, the inside of the rear connecting      portion (35) in the shape of a U of the saddle (30) has a second ramp (36)      which is inclined (37) towards the bottom and to the front of the boot and      ends in a hook (38). </PAR><PAR>  According to another essential characteristic of the invention (see FIG.      3), the rear cuff (20) has at the rear and in its center (25) a pin (26),      on which there comes to be articulated a lever designated by the general      reference (40), in which there is formed a slot (41), in which there comes      to be accommodated and to slide the end (42) of a rigid arm (43), made of      steel for example, which is articulated at its other end (44) about a pin      (45) arranged on the shell (1) in the region of the calcaneus (6). </PAR><PAR>  A cable (50) in common use for these applications is fixed by its ends at      (51) and (51a) on the front cuff (15) and passes at (52) to the free end      of the lever (40), passing via deflectors (53) formed to this effect in      the rear cuff (20). </PAR><PAR>  The boot also comprises in known manner members (not shown) for retaining      the foot and the heel in the shell. </PAR><PAR>  When the boot is in the open position (FIG. 1), the saddle (30) is pivoted      towards the bottom about the axis (31), the finger (34) is in the most      advanced position possible towards the toe (2) on the ramp (10), and the      collar is in a position pivoted towards the rear. </PAR><PAR>  When the skier has put the boot on and wants to close the boot, he pushes      the saddle (30) towards the front and towards the top. In doing this, the      saddle pivots about its axis (31) and the finger (34) rises on the first      portion of the ramp (11) by lever effect. This has the effect of drawing      the rear cuff (20) into pivoting about the axis (22) as a result of the      displacement of the axis (31) towards the top. During this movement, the      rigid arm (43) of constant length exerts a force on the lever (40), which      makes it pivot towards the bottom about its pin (26), which has the effect      of keeping the cable (50) tensioned (see FIG. 4). When the collar (20)      arrives in the high position, that is to say when the finger (34) arrives      on the peak (12) of the ramp (10), the end (52) of the lever (40), via      which the flexible cable (50) passes, touches the connecting portion (35),      (see FIG. 5). </PAR><PAR>  It is important that the angle .beta. (see FIG. 5) formed between the axis      of the lever (40) and this connecting portion (35) is less than 90.degree.      in order to pass the point of equilibrium and to be able to continue its      movement. </PAR><PAR>  By continuing the movement on the saddle (see FIG. 6), the free end (54) of      the lever (40), in which the cable (50) passes, slides along the ramp (36,      37) until it comes to be accommodated in the hook (38). It is important      that in this position the cable (50) comes below the articulation pin (26)      of the lever on the rear of the rear cuff (20), in order to ensure the      irreversibility of this position. </PAR><PAR>  When the end (46) of the lever (40) is in the characteristic hook (38), the      saddle is self-locked and is kept in this position. </PAR><PAR>  Although in the preferred exemplary embodiment described the collar is made      in two parts, it goes without saying that, without leaving the scope of      the invention, this collar can also be made in one single piece which is      articulated towards the rear. In this case, the cable (50) surrounds the      bottom of the leg over the flaps of the collar. </PAR><PAR>  The boot is thus perfectly closed and clamped on the bottom of the leg of      the skier. </PAR><PAR>  This arrangement, which is simple to manufacture, is characterized by a      larger opening, a simplified cable (50) circuit and, above all, it makes      possible good closing and perfect clamping by means of a single movement. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
