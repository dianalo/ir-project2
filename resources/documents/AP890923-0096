In their first meeting since April, the officials of the Group ofSeven _ the United States, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain,France, Canada and Italy _ are reviewing this year's rise in thevalue of the dollar, which is endangering the improvement in theAmerican trade deficit.   A strong dollar hurts the trade deficit by raising the price ofU.S. goods on overseas markets while making foreign goods cheaperfor American consumers. The trade gap shrank by 22 percent last yearand has continued to improve this year, although at only about halfof 1988's rate.   When the finance officials and central bank governors of theseven nations last met, they agreed to try to curb a furtherincrease in the dollar. They've backed the rhetoric with heavyintervention in currency markets, the process in which central banksbuy and sell dollars in an attempt to influence dollar prices.   But even though the central banks have sold billions, the priceof the dollar continued to rise. Analysts say intervention isbecoming less effective because government sales amount to anincreasingly smaller fraction of the mushrooming volume of dailycurrency trading.   Since the last G-7 meeting, the dollar has appreciated by about10 percent against the Japanese yen and 3 percent against the WestGerman mark. The dollar on Friday bought 146 yen and 1.95 marks,well above what is presumed to be the upper limit of the tradingrange sought by the Group of Seven _ 140 yen and 1.90 marks.   In advance of Saturday's meeting, conducted in private, analystswere expecting the G-7 to do little more than issue a vaguecommunique expressing concern about the dollar's strength.   However, economists were holding out the possibility that theUnited States, Japan and Germany may show more willingness in themonths ahead to raise or lower interest rates as a means ofinfluencing exchange markets.   An increase in Japanese and West German interest rates would makeinvesting in those countries more attractive and would thus raisethe value of their currencies. A cut in interest rates in the UnitedStates would push the dollar lower.   ``The fact of the matter is intervention does not work in thelong run,'' said economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill. ``The onlylong-term solution really is to change monetary policy.''   Economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., a governmentsecurities dealer in New York, speculated that the Japanese and WestGerman officials would agree at Saturday's meeting to raise theirinterest rates if the dollar threatened to rise above 2.00 marks and150 yen.   ``There is also the possibility, and I'd underscore the word`possibility,' of Fed loosening'' in the fourth quarter, he said.``I think the G-7 is going to speak softly but carry a big stick onthe dollar this time.''   In addition to the narrow question of exhange rates, financeofficials were expected to discuss the broader issue of economiccoordination. The United States has been pressing West Germany andJapan to stimulate consumer demand in their countries as a means ofcutting their trade surpluses and reducing the U.S. deficit. TheUnited States, in turn, is being urged to reignite efforts to curbits budget deficit, which is believed to contribute to the tradedeficit.   The Third World debt problem was also expected to be discussed bythe officials. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who hosted theG-7 meeting with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, hasbeen promoting a new strategy to relieve developing nations of theircrushing $1.3 trillion debt burden.   However, the decision by three large U.S. banks last week to add$4 billion to their loss reserves for Third World debt is raisingconcern that the banks will be unwilling to make the new loansneeded by developing countries for economic growth.   The Group of Seven talks were being held before the start of theannual meetings this week of the 152-nation International MonetaryFund and its sister lending organization, the World Bank.   The finance ministers and central banks governors arrived inlimousines at the Blair House, across the street from the WhiteHouse, before lunch. The G-7 session was preceded by a Group of Fivemeeting _ the G-7 excluding Canada and Italy _ at the Treasury.   Brady met one-on-one with Ryutaro Hashimoto, the new Japaneseminister of finance, and Pierre Beregovoy, the French financeminister. It was Brady's first meeting with Hashimoto.</TEXT></DOC>
