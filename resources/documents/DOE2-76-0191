This hyptothesisis based on the observation that radiation exposure results in tissueinjury and tissue injury is associated with the release of cyclooxygenaseproducts. In order to determine if cyclooxygenase products play a rolein radiation-induced tissue injury, an association between radiationexposure and altered cyclooxygenase product release must first be demonstrated.Secondly, an evaluation of the effect of cyclooxygenase pathway inhibitorsand exogeneous prostaglandins on radiation-induced tissue injury mustbe made. This review is divided into two sections: 1) radiation-inducedalterations in cyclooxygenase product release and 2) the role of cyclooxygenaseproducts in radiation-induced tissue injury. An overview of the literatureis presented both in support of, and against, the hypothesis stated above.</TEXT></DOC>
