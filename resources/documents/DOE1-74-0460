This sharp rise in Canadian heavyoil production will result in unique demands on the downstream sectorof the industry. These demands will present a whole new range of technicalproblems and opportunities for innovation. Downstream concerns specificallyinclude a potential diluent shortage, pipelines capacity restrictionsand availability of markets. Failure to address these concerns couldresult in the use of expensive substitute diluents, allocated capacityin pipelines, reduced prices and shut-in production. Potential solutionsincluding upgrading and others must be viewed from the producer's perspective.The issues are large in scope and practical solutions may take yearsto develop. Significant planning and technical creativity, as well ascooperation among producers and with the downstream sector, will be requiredin order to resolve the issues. The heavy oil producer must be preparedto address the key downstream questions if heavy oil development is toproceed.</TEXT></DOC>
