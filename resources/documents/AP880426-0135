With 30 percent of the vote counted, the state-controlled KBStelevision network reported that candidates from three oppositionparties were leading in 117 races.   Candidates in President Roh Tae-woo's Democratic Justice Partyled in only 90. There were no immediate trends reported in theother 17 races for the 224 single-member districts.   Another 75 seats in the 299-member assembly will be decided bythe parties' nationwide vote proportions.   The Korean news agency Yonhap predicted that Roh's party wouldfail to win a majority. Earlier predictions said the governingparty would triumph because of divisions within the opposition.   Opposition control of the legislature would have added impactunder a new constitution that took effect in February, when Rohstarted a five-year term after winning office in December with 36percent of the vote.   The new basic law, part of democratic reforms begun last summerafter widespread anti-government demonstrations, gives the assemblypowers to investigate government actions. The president no longercan dissolve the legislature, which has a four-year term.   Today's protests followed a report Monday by one televisionstation that Democratic Justice Party candidate Hyun Kyung-dae hadwon a seat on southern Cheju Island with 39 percent of the vote.The station, part of the MBC network, said the report accidentallywent on the air during a rehearsal for today's election coverage.   The network said it fired the station manager and four otherofficials.   But the gaffe fueled protests on the island, where an estimated1,000 people fought with police. News reports said authorities wereinvestigating whether the broadcast broke election laws.   In other developments, an opposition campaigner died afterdrenching himself in gasoline and igniting it during an argumentwith government supporters in the southern city of Woekwan, Koreanpress reports said. The man was identified as Lee Kwang-ho, 21, amember of the Reunification Democratic Party.   Korean newspapers also said two opposition campaigners were incritical condition after being stabbed by unknown assailants inHwasoon, another southern city.   In Seoul, police fired tear gas to disperse 300 YonseiUniversity students who threw rocks and firebombs to protestalleged election manipulation in favor of the governing party.   Earlier, police broke up a similar protest by 50 Yonseistudents. No injuries were reported.   Hundreds of students dashed through streets in Seoul's downtownMyongdong shopping area, shouting slogans against ``electionrigging'' and chanting ``Down with dictatorship.''   Police pursued them, sometimes hurling tear gas grenades.Citizens rescued a student being dragged away by riot police.   Yonhap said police arrested more 120 students around Kwangju insouthwestern South Korea.   In the southern city of Chonju, about 500 opposition supportersbattled riot police. In Mockpo, another southern city, hundreds ofprotesters occupied downtown streets.   Voting began at 7 a.m. and the polls closed at 6 p.m. (5 a.m.EDT).   Officials estimated 72.6 percent of the 26.2 million registeredvoters turned out, down from 84.6 percent in the 1985 legislativeelections and 89.2 percent in the December presidential election.   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam of the Reunification DemocraticParty, who ran for an assembly seat in the southern city of Pusan,accused the government of staging ``unjust elections unprecedentedin our history.''   On Monday, the governing party expelled one candidate after4,296 envelopes, each containing about $30 and leaflets forDemocratic Justice candidate Kwon Joong-dong, were found byopposition members at a post office in Andong, south of Seoul.   At an Andong cathedral, riot police fired tear gas at 40 RomanCatholic farmers who demanded the candidate's arrest, Yonhop said.   Police reported 90 cases of election-related violence nationwidein the campaign, with more than 150 people detained and 77 of themformally charged.   Observers said before the election that the opposition was tooweak to win. Support for the opposition eroded after its leaders,Kim Dae-jung of the Party for Peace and Democracy and KimYoung-sam, ran in the December presidential election.   They split the opposition vote and allowed Roh to win the firstdirect presidential election in 16 years.   The governing party, campaigning on pledges of stability foreconomic and democratic progress, had hoped to win about 125 of the224 seats being decided in single-member districts, along with 38of the 75 seats to be decided by the parties' nationwide voteproportions.</TEXT></DOC>
