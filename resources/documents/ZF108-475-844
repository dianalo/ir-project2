 A simple way to understandthe spreadsheet market is to divide it into three levels: high-end,full-performance products -- such as Excel, Full Impact, and Wingz -- thatinclude development environments; midrange systems such as Trapeze, RagTime,and Microsoft Works; and straightforward calculation tools such as MacCalc.andM;The market can be further broken down into functional segments: numbercrunching (or straight calculation), in which MacCalc is a contender;presentation, where Trapeze, Works, RagTime, Excel, Full Impact, and Wingzare the stars; and development, where Excel, Wingz, and Full Impact shine.andM;If you are buying your first spreadsheet program, don't be intimidated by theesoteric features of high-end products.andP;  These programs have a great deal ofversatility; Excel and Wingz are proficient in all three functionalitysegments, and Full Impact lacks only sophisticated number-crunching tools.andO;Spreadsheet programs are a classic one-time investment -- once you learn howto use one, you'll be reluctant to change -- so consider buying the mostflexible program.andP;  In many cases, the price difference between a low- ormidlevel program and a high-end spreadsheet program is less than $250, so theinitial investment in a high-end product will ensure that you have plenty ofroom for growth.andM;Whether or not you know exactly which tier of the market and functionalitylevel you want in a spreadsheet program, the diagrams that accompany thisarticle should help you decide on the best spreadsheet program for you.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
