Both Mr. Blumand I were employed by the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee, Subcommittee on Multinational Corporations,chaired by the late Sen. Frank Church (D., Idaho). I wascounsel to the subcommittee and Mr. Blum was associatecounsel, so if anyone worked for anyone, it was Mr. Blum whoworked for me.   However, the point is less who worked for whom; theinaccuracy in Mr. Asman's article is merely symptomatic ofthe biased coverage of the BCCI Peru matter, where innuendois used to imply wrongdoing on the part of Alan Garcia andthe APRA government.</LP><TEXT>   Not even Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau hassaid there is any evidence linking Mr. Garcia to the allegedbribe payments to two Peruvian Central Bank officials.Indeed, one of those officials was appointed to his positionin the administration preceding Mr. Garcia's.   With respect to the alleged brokering of Mirage jet sales,again there is no evidence such a transaction was undertakenbeyond the speculative imaginings of BCCI officials.   There is a great deal more that could be said: the role ofthe U.S. government in collaborating with the Peruvianpolitical right, directly contrary to the State Department'snote to the Peruvian authorities setting forth the legallimits of the cooperation that could be extended to them, anaspect of the story that Journal correspondents do not wishto pursue. Mr. Morgenthau himself played into the hands ofthe Peruvian right by his collaboration with them in hisinvestigation.   The untold scandal of the BCCI Peru story is how theallegations of financial wrongdoing by others became a coverfor actions by U.S. government agencies discrediting aPeruvian president who had the audacity to tell the truthabout the foreign debt of Latin America -- that it can neverbe paid in full -- and APRA, one of the few authenticallysocial democratic parties in Latin America.   Mr. Asman's article, aside from being factuallyinaccurate, continues this tradition.   Jerome I. Levinson   Washington   (Mr. Levinson is Mr. Garcia's attorney in the U.S.)</TEXT></DOC>
