Two willow plots (Salix viminalisand S. dasyclados) and one plot with Alnus incana were all irrigated-fertilizedby drip tubes during the growing season while an unplanted referenceplot was not. The reference plot contained less water than the irrigatedones and the water content increased almost linearly with increased depthin this plot. Liming increased pH in the 0-30 cm soil layer and irrigated-fertilizedplots showed a faster increase of pH than the reference plot. However,the pH profiles obtained were concluded to be non-optimal for the rootgrowth of willow but satisfactory for grey alder. (authors). With 48refs.</TEXT></DOC>
