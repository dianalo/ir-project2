Lethal injection machines, electric chairs, gallows and gaschambers form the catalog of equipment designed and built byAmerican Engineering, believed to be the only company in the UnitedStates that exclusively makes execution equipment.   Four years ago, it created the first computer-controlled machineto regulate the flow of drugs in a lethal injection. Five stateshave bought the $30,000 device, company president Norbert C. Lynchsaid, from New Jersey in 1984 to Delaware earlier this year.   In 1983, an engineer friend of Lynch's heard a disc jockeymocking New Jersey because it advertised for executioners. The ideawas planted: how to automate lethal injection.   ``The methodology that's used in the lethal injection on a manualsystem is barbaric,'' Lynch said, who runs the company and afinancial consulting firm from a storefront here.   The basic complications in lethal injection, both Lynch and deathpenalty opponents agree, are ruptured veins, inaccurate dosages andfailure to immediately induce unconsciousness.   Of the 37 states where capital punishment is legal, 16 prescribedeath by lethal injection. Some, like Delaware, haven't executedanyone in decades and have electric chairs and gas chambers thatmight not work if needed.   According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 98 people havebeen executed in the United States since the Supreme Court upheldthe death penalty in 1976, including five this year and 25 in 1987.   More than 2,020 inmates populate death row, ACLU figures show.   Delaware contracted for one of the machines last year after thestate changed its capital punishment law to lethal injection fromhanging, said H. Brooke Laggner, chief of administration andoperational support for the state Department of Correction.   ``It takes away the element that you don't have any Hippocraticoath problems because all you need is someone to set up an i.v.,''Laggner said of the machine, which Delaware bought along with a$60,000 execution trailer designed by American Engineering.   Civil libertarians rail at that sort of thinking, saying there isno ethical justification in making executions easier or moreefficient.   ``The worst sin of all is to do that well which shouldn't be doneat all,'' said Henry Schwarzschild, director of the ACLU's capitalpunishment project.   ``The notion that a homicide becomes nicer if you do it nicely ismorally outrageous,'' he said.   A 3-by-4-foot gray box with a row of switches and red lights,Lynch's machine is mounted to the wall above the inmate's gurney.Intravenous tubing inserted by a medical technician into theinmate's arm runs through the wall to a computerized control module.   Two executioners push one button each to start the machine, soneither knows who actually activates the pistons that send the threedeadly drugs through syringes and into the inmate.   A dosage of sodium pentathol renders the inmate unconscious. Thesecond drug is pancuronium bromide, or Pavulon, which in large dosesparalyzes body functions. The third, potassium chloride, ensuresheart arrest.   The execution should take four to six minutes. Lynch said theprisoner won't feel anything. ``He's going to go out and that's theend of it. Over and out.''   American Engineering, with assets of about $100,000, has alimited market for its wares. But Lynch feels the condition of thenation's execution devices and the lack of competition could meanmore contracts.   For states that don't use lethal injection, American Engineeringalso designs electric chairs, gas chambers and gallows.   Lynch said he has sold three electric helmets at $5,000 apieceand three sets of leg stocks at $2,000 each, and redesigned onegallows for $15,000. Citing confidentiality, Lynch refused toidentify the states involved.   Lynch said he opposes capital punishment, but noted that if it'sgoing to be done, ``it should be done right. If we're going to hangthis person then we should be using the proper rope. And you can'tblame the rope-maker for the hanging.''</TEXT></DOC>
