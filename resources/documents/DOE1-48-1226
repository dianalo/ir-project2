This listing sequentiallyorders the flow of coal and its byproduct ash. The fuel preparation systemis necessarily the starting point in the process and is the subject ofthis paper. Based on experience at TVA's 20 MW AFBC Pilot Plant, andeconomics, TVA elected to install two (2) independent preparation trainseach capable of providing 90 TPH of sized (1/2&quot; top size, 20% max. andless;28mesh) and dried (6% max. moisture) coal to the fuel feed system. Thisrate of prepared fuel is 130% of the AFBC MCR requirement when burningthe design coal. Coal drying is required to prevent pluggage of the underbed-feedtransport lines and sizing is required for fluidization and burnout performancein the combustor.</TEXT></DOC>
