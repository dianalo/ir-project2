The local phone companies accumulated overcharges between 1985and 1988 under FCC guidelines that allowed prices of thesehigh-capacity private-line services to exceed the phone companies'costs of providing the services.   The FCC ordered a refund Tuesday as it considered challenges tothe special pricing scheme, which the local phone companies providefor long-distance companies or large business customers.   The commission voted 4-0 that the scheme was legal during the1985-88 period, when the high prices were designed to keep too manycustomers from switching from the regular public telephone networkto private lines, but that market conditions today no longerjustified continuation of the special pricing.   The commission said it expected the local phone companies torefrain from requesting such special prices in the future.   While it was examining the challenges to the special pricingscheme, the commission said it found that local phone companies insome cases had charged more than allowed under the commission'sguidelines. Therefore, the companies must refund those charges,which could amount to as much as $75 million, the commission said.   The FCC said the amount of the refunds will not be known untilthe local phone companies file detailed reports with thecommission. The companies have 40 days to make their filings.   The companies found not to be in compliance with thecommission's pricing guidelines from Oct. 1, 1985, to Dec. 31,1986, were:   Diamond State; South Central Bell in Alabama; Southwestern Bellin Missouri and Oklahoma; Northwestern Bell in Iowa, Minnesota,Nebraksa and North Dakota; and Pacific Northwest Bell in Idaho.   Companies found not complying from Jan. 1, 1987, to Dec. 31,1988, were:   Ohio Bell; Wisconsin Bell; Southern Bell in North Carolina andSouth Carolina; South Central Bell in Mississippi and Tennessee;Pacific Bell; Nevada Bell; Southwestern Bell; Mountain Bell;Northwestern Bell; and Cincinnati Bell.</TEXT></DOC>
