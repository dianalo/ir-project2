SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Most Americans who move don't venture far fromtheir old homes but those who switch states seem to prefer to headsouth, the Census Bureau said Wednesday.   Southern states scored a net gain of 279,000 movers betweenMarch 1986 and March 1987, the bureau said in a study covering themost recent mobility figures available.   The analysis of people who moved during that time found that18.1 percent of all Americans relocated, about the same as in theyear before, amounting to about 42.5 million people changing homes.   Those movers included 27.2 million who relocated within the samecounty, 8.8 million who moved to another county in the same stateand 6.6 million who changed states.   In addition, 1.1 million people moved in from abroad.   The South's strong showing resumes the trend of the early 1980swhen the that region was the largest gainer as millions ofAmericans flocked to the Sun Belt.   In 1984-85 and 1985-86, the attractiveness of the South seemedto slip a bit, with the Western states showing the largest gainfrom movers.   But the new study shows the West back in second place, adding166,000 movers to their population in the 1986-87 period.   Most of the 1986-87 movers who changed regions _ 334,000 _ camefrom the Northeast, with the remaining 111,000 leaving the Midwest,according to the study.   Overall mobility has been relatively steady in this decade,slightly below the 20 percent annual rates recorded in the 1960sand 1970s.   There was a jump back to the 20 percent moving rate in 1984-85,which some analysts attributed to pent-up demand among people whohad postponed moves during the recession early in the decade. Sincethen, the rate has evened out again.   The 1986-87 analysis found that movement into metropolitan areasis continuing, with a net gain of 932,000 people. Within theseareas it was the suburbs that were growing, however. Central citieslost 1 million people over the year while suburbs grew by 1.9million.   Hispanic Americans moved more often than Americans in general,relocating at a 22.6 percent rate. Blacks recorded a 19.6 percentmobility rate and non-Hispanic whites had a 17.4 percent rate.   Regionally, blacks, like other Americans, moved South. The Southhad a net gain of 148,000 blacks during the year, while all threeother regions showed a net loss of blacks.   Regional mobility figures for Hispanics were not reported, norwere figures for individual states.   Other findings of the study included:   _Young adults were the most mobile Americans, with 34.7 percentof those aged 20 to 24 moving during the year, and a 31.8 percentrate for people aged 25 to 29.   _Men were somewhat more likely to have moved than women, 18.4percent vs. 17.8 percent.   _Bein a member of a family tended to add to stability, the studyfound. People living in a family had a 16.4 percent rate of moving,compared with 22.1 percent for people living alone or withunrelated people.   _People who had completed four years of college had the highestmobility rate, 21.8 percent. People who attended college but didn'tgraduate were next at 19.6 percent. People who had gone on to gradschool moved at about the same rate as those who only finished highschool, 17 percent.   The lowest rate was 11.8 percent for people who had not finishedhigh school. Most of them are elderly, the study said.</TEXT></DOC>
