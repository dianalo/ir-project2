In the preferred embodiment,      the composite material comprising the anti-galling coating surface is a      nickel/phosphorous alloy material having micron-sized Teflon particles      occluded therein. The present method substantially increases the quality      of the finished work product as well as the overall service life of the      honing tool itself. An improved honing tool construction is also produced      through usage of the present method. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAR>  The present invention relates to an improved method for plating super      abrasive materials such as abrasives that include diamond particles,      particles of cubic boron nitride and other like hard materials onto a      particular substrate such as a honing tool, which method includes coating      the plated abrasive bond with a thin layer of a composite material      including a metal or metal alloy material containing a friction reducing      or lubricating type substance such as a nickel/phosphorous alloy which      contains micron-sized Teflon particles occluded therein so as to provide      anti-stick and anti-gall properties to the bond between the super abrasive      particles. This improved plating process substantially eliminates any      galling or scoring of the honed work surface during a honing operation due      to stock material which may accumulate between the abrasive particles and      it increases the overall service life of the honing tool. Although coating      the abrasive bond with a nickel/phosphorous/Teflon (Ni-P-PTFE) composite      material is preferred, it is recognized that a wide variety of other metal      or metal alloy composite materials containing a friction reducing type      agent may likewise be utilized to provide the desired anti-stick and      anti-gall properties to the bond. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The abrasive portion of a honing tool is the working portion of the tool as      it is this portion of the tool which engages a particular workpiece under      pressure during a honing operation and removes material therefrom until      the desired final diameter of the workpiece has been achieved. As stock is      being removed from a workpiece during a honing operation, metal chips and      shavings have a tendency to load or stack up between the protruding      abrasive particles on the honing tool, such build-up eventually leading to      galling or scoring of the honed work surface. This is a continuing and      on-going problem in many honing operations and the accumulation or      adherence of such stock material between the abrasive particles is      particularly true of ductile type materials such as stainless steel which      produce long stringy chips or shavings during the honing process.      Typically, such long stringy chips will fill up or clog the spaces between      the protruding abrasive particles on the tool and then, after they have      been hardened by compaction through the honing action itself, enough heat      is eventually generated during honing that these chips or shavings will      actually weld and bond themselves to the bonding matrix between the      adjacent abrasive particles thereby causing galling or scoring of the      honed work surface as the honing operation continues. Also, this stock      material build-up reduces the cutting effectiveness of the abrasive      particles and, once the abrasive particles wear to the same surface level      as the stock build-up between such particles, any effective cutting action      is eliminated. This phenomena therefore not only diminishes the quality of      the finished work product but it also diminishes the overall service life      of the tool and eventually leads to the termination of such tool as an      effective cutting member. </PAR><PAR>  Various means have been utilized in an effort to reduce and minimize the      occurrence of having stock material build-up and collect between the      abrasive particles of a honing tool thereby causing the aforementioned      problems. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,155,721 discloses a dual bonding      process for making single layered grinding tools wherein a metallic      substrate is pre-etched so as to suitably cavitate the substrate surface      prior to plating. Etching is believed to create small cavities in the      substrate surface, each such cavity being adapted to individually receive      a portion of an abrasive particle. This arrangement provides a stronger      mechanical bond between the abrasive particles and the metal plated      surface of the substrate so that at least a portion of the abrasive      particles are recessed below the shear plane. This process further      includes a second plating step wherein a second metallic bond matrix can      thereafter be applied over the first metal coating to prevent stock      build-up and adherence to the bond matrix between the abrasive particles.      This second plating bath is comprised of metal ions only and, when the      type and thickness of this second coating of metal is properly selected      for the intended application of the tool, this second coating of metal      between the abrasive particles helps to prevent glazing of the cutting      edge of the tool due to the same stock build-up between the abrasive      particles as previously explained. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,832,707; 4,973,338; and 4,868,069 likewise disclose      various metal-bonded tools and methods for manufacturing the same      including various anti-static and abrasion-resistant coatings for use with      such abrasive products to decrease the incidences of stock build-up      between the abrasive particles thereby improving the overall quality of      the finished work product, including grinding efficiency and finishing      accuracy. More particularly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,832,707 discloses a method of      manufacturing a metal-bonded tool which uses diamond particles as the      abrasive material for high efficiency grinding. This patent specifically      addresses the problem associated with the grinding chips accumulating in      the hollows formed within the bond holding the abrasive particles to the      particular substrate and attempts to solve such problem by regulating the      quantity of the carbon or graphite and the size of such precipitates in      the bond. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,973,338 likewise attempts to reduce the incidence of      build-up or clogging of the abrasive surface by treating the coated      abrasive materials with an appropriate amount of a quaternary ammonium      anti-static compound comprising about 15 to about 35 carbon atoms in a      molecular weight not less than about 300. It has been found that coated      abrasive materials, thus treated, have a combination of anti-static,      lubricity and anti-loading characteristics which provide improved abrading      efficiency and longer abrading life. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,069 discloses a method for improving the abrasion      resistance of various substrates wherein the substrate is coated with a      relatively soft metal matrix in which abrasion-resistant grit particles      are embedded. The coating comprises abrasion-resistant particles that      protrude from a metal matrix having a surface that is hardened relative to      the bulk of the metal matrix, the coating being metallurgically bonded to      the substrate. Embedding grit particles in the hardened coating prevents      the grit particles from dislodging and it also prevents catastrophic      cracks from developing in the coating. </PAR><PAR>  Although all of the above-identified known prior art processes appear to      address a similar type problem, namely, accumulation and adherence of      stock build-up between the abrasive particles in the substrate as well as      the destruction or plastic deformation of the bond therebetween with a      resultant deterioration of finishing accuracy and quality, none of the      known processes include the use of a nickel/Teflon or other metal or metal      alloy composite material having a lubricant type substance occluded      therewithin as an anti-galling agent for applying to and coating over the      top of the bond already established between the plated abrasive particles      on a honing tool as previously explained. The self-lubricating or friction      reducing characteristics associated with Teflon particles or other      suitable lubricating agents as will be hereinafter further explained in      combination with the nickel or other metal or metal alloy material      contained in the composite coating material produces both an anti-stick,      anti-galling coating surface as well as a strong, abrasive resistant      coating which adheres to and becomes part of the underlying bond and is      capable of withstanding the forces and stresses of a honing operation      without destruction and/or deformation. For these and other reasons, the      present process differs both composition wise and application wise from      the bonding processes disclosed in the known prior art. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention teaches an improved process for plating super      abrasive particles onto a honing tool which, in its preferred embodiment,      includes coating and bonding a metal/Teflon composite material such as      nickel/phosphorous/Teflon (Ni-P-PTFE) as an anti-galling or friction      reducing agent over the top of the bond already established between the      plated abrasive particles and the honing tool once such particles are      bonded to such honing tool. In the preferred method, the plated abrasive      bond is coated with a thin layer of an electroless nickel/phosphorous      alloy that contains micron-sized Teflon particles embedded therewithin so      as to provide anti-stick and anti-gall properties to the bond. The      nickel/phosphorous/Teflon composite coating applied over the known bond is      typically about 0.0002 to 0.0005 inch thick so that the overall bond      thickness between the abrasive particles will remain approximately the      same as compared to previous known bonding techniques. It is recognized      that any number of coatings of the friction reducing, anti-galling agent      can be applied as well as any thickness of such agent. Use of the      nickel/phosphorous/Teflon composite material over the appropriate bond      matrix necessary for attaching a super abrasive material to a honing tool      prevents the metal chips and shavings produced during the honing operation      from building up and collecting between the abrasive particles thereby      substantially eliminating and alleviating the above-identified problems of      galling and scoring of the particular workpiece during honing. Although      use of the nickel/phosphorous/Teflon composite coating is preferred, other      nickel/Teflon composite materials as well as other metals and alloys      capable of being joined to a metal substrate and having a surface friction      reducing agent associated therewith may also be utilized as the      anti-galling agent. </PAR><PAR>  The construction of the honing tool itself after the working portion of      such tool is coated with the present anti-galling coating agent is also      new and novel in the honing tool art. </PAR><PAR>  It is therefore a principal object of the present invention to teach an      improved process for plating super abrasive materials onto a honing tool. </PAR><PAR>  Another object is to provide a means for substantially reducing the      build-up of stock material between the protruding abrasive particles on a      honing tool during a honing operation. </PAR><PAR>  Another object is to provide a means for minimizing the glazing of the      cutting edge of the honing tool as it wears during a honing operation. </PAR><PAR>  Another object is to provide a means for preventing the metal chips and      shavings produced during a honing operation from bonding to the abrasive      portion of the honing tool during a honing operation. </PAR><PAR>  Another object is to teach the construction of a honing tool wherein the      bonding matrix for attaching the abrasive particles to the working portion      of the tool includes improved anti-stick and anti-galling characteristics. </PAR><PAR>  Another object is to provide a means for preventing the galling or scoring      of the honed work surface during a honing operation. </PAR><PAR>  Another object is to teach a method for plating super abrasive materials      onto a honing tool wherein a nickel/Teflon or other metal or metal      alloy/friction reducing type composite material is utilized as an      anti-galling agent. </PAR><PAR>  Another object is to teach a method for plating super abrasive materials      onto a honing tool wherein a nickel/phosphorous/Teflon composite material      is utilized as an anti-galling agent. </PAR><PAR>  Another object is to provide a method for plating super abrasives onto a      honing tool wherein a substantially smooth, anti-stick, anti-gall bonding      surface is produced which prevents the metal chips and shavings produced      during a honing operation from building up and collecting on such surface      between the abrasive particles. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become      apparent to those skilled in the art after considering the following      detailed specification in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a side-elevational view of one embodiment of a typical honing      mandrel, including a tubular honing member and an expander member which is      slidably movable therewithin; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 a side-elevational view illustrating the first plating process      associated with the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a side-elevational view illustrating the second plating process      associated with the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a side-elevational view illustrating the third plating process      associated with the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is an enlarged, partial side-elevational view showing the bond      matrix between two adjacent abrasive particles of FIG. 4; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is an enlarged, partial cross-sectional view taken along line 6--6      of FIG. 1 illustrating the bonding of an abrasive material onto the      working portion of a honing tool in accordance with the teachings of the      present invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of one embodiment of another honing      mandrel wherein the present invention also has particular utility, the      honing mandrel being shown in operative position in a cylinder to be honed     . </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring to the drawings more particularly by reference numbers wherein      like numbers refer to like parts, number 10 in FIG. 1 identifies one of      many possible embodiments of a typical honing tool or mandrel commonly      used for attachment to a honing machine to accomplish a honing operation.      The honing tool or mandrel 10 includes an elongated substantially tubular      honing member 12 having a passageway or bore (not shown) extending      therethrough from end-to-end adaptable for cooperatively receiving an      expander member or arbor 14 positioned therethrough. The honing member 12      includes an outer surface 16, preferably substantially cylindrical, a      portion 18 of which is typically plated with a super abrasive material as      illustrated in FIG. 1. Such super abrasive materials typically include      diamond particles or particles of cubic boron nitride in a suitable binder      or other like hard materials. Use of such super abrasive materials is well      known in the honing art. Typically, only a portion of the honing tool is      plated with such abrasive particles and the specific arrangement and      amount of coverage of such abrasive particles on a particular honing tool      is usually dependent upon the particular application and the surface      finish desired after honing. Although a specific abrasive configuration is      illustrated in FIG. 1, it is recognized that a wide variety of different      abrasive patterns may be utilized depending upon the particular      application desired and the type of super abrasive material being used.      Nevertheless, regardless of the specific arrangement and amount of      coverage of a particular super abrasive material, the present invention is      directed specifically and particularly to an improved process for plating      such super abrasive particles onto the working portion of the honing tool      such as the abrasive portion 18 illustrated in FIG. 1. Other honing tool      or mandrel constructions for which the present invention is likewise      particularly useful are those single pass through honing tool      constructions disclosed in Sunnen U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,197,680 and 4,253,279      as well as a variety of radially expandable mandrel constructions such as      the construction illustrated in FIG. 7. Other radially expandable mandrel      constructions having particluar utility for the present invention include      those constructions disclosed in Sunnen U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,216,155;      4,524,549; and 4,555,875. </PAR><PAR>  More specifically, the present improved process or method utilizes a      nickel/phosphorous/Teflon (Ni-P-PTFE) composite material, or other metal      or metal alloy material having a friction reducing or surface lubricating      type material occluded or otherwise associated therewith, as the      anti-galling agent for applying to and coating the bond established      between the plated abrasive particles and the honing tool once such      particles are bonded by known techniques to such tool. Although any      suitable means for attaching or bonding the abrasive particles to the tool      substrate may be utilized without impairing the teachings of the present      invention, an electroplated process is generally preferred. In this      regard, multi-layers of a super abrasive material such as diamond      particles and/or cubic boron nitride particles are positioned and held      against the tool substrate and an initial thin layer of an electroplated      material is applied thereagainst using known techniques in order to hold      and attach the adjacent first layer of particles to the substrate. The      results of this first plating process or bath are illustrated in FIG. 2      wherein multi-layers of a super abrasive grit 20 are held against the tool      substrate 22 and an initial thin bond of electroplated material 24 is      formed by and between the first adjacent layer of abrasive grit particles      21 and the tool substrate 22. Well known electro plating processes are      available for accomplishing this task. Electroplated materials typically      used for this type of bond application include such metals as nickel,      copper, cobalt and chromium; such metal alloys as nickel phosphorous,      nickel boron and brass; and other materials including autocatalytic or      electroless plating. Autocatalytic plating refers to a process wherein the      deposit material itself catalyzes the reduction reaction at the tool      surface. </PAR><PAR>  After this first initial electroplated or electroless plated process is      applied to the particular abrasive particles and the associated substrate,      the adjacent first layer of particles such as the particles 21 illustrated      in FIG. 2 is only loosely secured or bonded to the substrate 22. In other      words, this initial bond 24 covers only a very small portion of the      overall height of the individual abrasive particles forming the adjacent      layer. Once this first plating process is completed, the surplus layers of      abrasive particles 20 (FIG. 2) are thereafter removed by known means and      the plating process or bath is re-activated and a thicker plated deposit      is applied to the initial bond 24 illustrated in FIG. 2 thereby further      bonding the first layer of abrasive particles 21 to the substrate 22. This      re-activation of the plating process (second plating process) allows      additional electroplated material 26 to be applied to the previous bond 24      to build-up the bond between such particles and the substrate 22. In this      regard, use of the term &quot;bond&quot; in describing the present process refers to      a mechanical bond, not a chemical or metallurgical bond. The plated      deposit material produces a close fitting socket that fills into the      irregular abrasive grit surface to attach such abrasive grit to the tool      substrate. The results of this second plating process are illustrated in      FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  This second plating operation helps to fill the voids between the abrasive      particles 21 and the substrate 22 so as to build-up the bond therebetween      as illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 5. Normally, a suitable bond between the      abrasive particles and the substrate is achieved when the space between      adjacent particles is filled with the bonding agent to a point somewhere      between 50% and 90% of the particle height. Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, it      can be seen that the overall height of the bond (24 and 26) between the      abrasive particles 21 illustrated in FIG. 3 is greater than the overall      height of the initial bond 24 illustrated in FIG. 2. It is recognized that      the above-described plating process can be re-activated and continued      until the overall desired bond height is achieved. This portion of the      present process just described is one of the known methods presently used      for bonding super abrasive particles to a particular honing tool. </PAR><PAR>  The main improvement of the present process as compared to the known      processes for plating super abrasive materials onto a particular substrate      lies in the use of a nickel/phosphorous/Teflon (Ni-P-PTFE) or other      equivalent type material as an anti-galling agent which is coated or      plated over the appropriate finished bond necessary for attaching the      super abrasive particles to the particular substrate. The present method      for plating the super abrasive particles to a particular substrate      therefore modifies the above-explained known process as follows. Instead      of completing the plating and bonding process to the desired bonding      height, the plating process described above is stopped at least a coating      thickness, typically about 0.0002 to 0.0005 inch, short of the desired      bond thickness and, at this point, a third plating process is activated      and a relatively thin deposit of nickel/phosphorous/Teflon or other      equivalent type material as will be hereinafter explained is Plated or      applied over the top of the bond already established between the abrasive      particles 21 and the substrate 22 illustrated in FIG. 3. The results of      this third plating process are illustrated in FIG. 4 and, more      particularly, in the enlarged, partial side-elevational view illustrated      in FIG. 5. As best shown in FIG. 5, this additional layer or coating 28 of      a nickel/phosphorous alloy material includes micron-sized Teflon particles      occluded therein to provide anti-stick and anti-gall properties to the      bond. The anti-galling composite coating 28 applied over the known bond      (24 and 26) is typically about 0.0002 to about 0.0005 inch thick so that      the overall bond thickness will remain approximately the same as compared      to known bonding techniques. </PAR><PAR>  It is important to note that a wide variety of other metals and metal      alloys as well as other surface friction reducing or lubricating type      materials may be utilized as the composite anti-galling coating material      depending upon the construction of the particular honing tool and the      characteristics of the honing application. For example, any of the well      known metals and alloys capable of being joined to a metal substrate can      be used in the practice of the present invention. Alloys such as      nickel-phosphorus compositions, nickel-boron compositions, nickel-chromium      compositions, nickel-tungsten compositions, and other nickel based alloys      are particularly useful. Various metallic carbides such as tungsten      carbide, chromium carbide and other metallic carbides can likewise be      used. For certain applications, pure metals such as chromium, nickel,      copper, cobalt, or aluminum may also be used. </PAR><PAR>  With respect to the lubricating or friction reducing agent in the      anti-galling composite material, this agent may be any composition which      can be occluded in metal or metal alloys and which can form at least a      semi-continuous lubricating type surface to which the abraded stock      material from a honing operation will not agglomerate. Such compositions      may be polymers such as the preferred polymer Teflon      (polytetrafluoroethylene) marketed by E. I. duPont de Nemours andamp; Company,      or such compositions may be silcone polymers, acrylonitrile polymers and      copolymers, polyamides, polycarbonates, polymers and copolymers of      polyoelfins such as ethylene, propylene and butylene, butadiene-styrene      copolymers and other known polymeric materials. Also, natural lubricants      such as graphite, mica and so forth may be used. Molybdenum disulphide      will also work in the practice of the present invention. Thus, particles      from any material which can be co-deposited with metal particles from a      plating solution and which will lower the friction coefficient of the      coating surface so as to form a smooth, slick surface, which smooth, slick      surface is sometimes referred to herein as a lubricating surface, may be      used in the practice of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  Although it is preferred that the third plating process be an electroless      plating process, any suitable means including an electroplating process      may be utilized to plate the anti-galling agent over the bond already      established between the abrasive particles and the substrate. It is also      recognized that any number of coatings of the friction reducing,      anti-galling agent can be applied over the known bond to achieve any      desired bond height. </PAR><PAR>  Testing has verified and demonstrated that the present improved process for      plating super abrasive materials onto a honing tool prevents the metal      chips and shavings produced during a honing operation from building up and      collecting between the abrasive particles. This is true because of the      friction reducing or lubricating characteristics associated with the      Teflon particles occluded within the nickel/phosphorous alloy or other      suitable equivalent type anti-stick, anti-gall coating material. The      respective size of the metallic and lubricating particles in the present      coating as well as the respective proportions thereof result in a surface      having at least a semi-continuous plane of lubricating material which      functions as a lubricating surface to which the metal chips and shavings      produced during a honing operation do not adhere. Generally the size of      the metal particles will range from about 0.5 microns to about 80 microns      in diameter and the size of the lubricating or friction reducing particles      will range from about 0.1 microns to about 10 microns in diameter, the      preferred particle size being about 1-2 microns in diameter. Best results      can be achieved when the lubricating or friction reducing particles range      from about 10% to about 25% of the entire anti-galling coating      composition, which composition includes the deposited metal or metal alloy      particles and the deposited lubricating or friction reducing particles.      The use and application of this very specific composite material coating      as explained above substantially eliminates the above-identified problems      of galling and scoring of the particular workpiece and of the abrasive      bond during honing. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is an enlarged, partial cross-sectional view taken through the      working portion 18 of the honing member 12 of FIG. 1 illustrating the      resultant bond 30 between the super abrasive particles 21 and the honing      member 12 produced in accordance with the teachings of the present      process. The micron-sized Teflon particles occluded within the coating 28      (FIG. 5) provide a substantially smooth, anti-stick, anti-gall surface      which prevents the metal chips and shavings produced during a honing      operation from building up, collecting and welding or otherwise bonding      themselves onto such surface between the abrasive particles. Also,      although the present process has been described as a three-step bonding      and coating process wherein the third coating process involves applying a      nickel/phosphorous/Teflon composite coating or other equivalent composite      coating over the top of the double bond established between the abrasive      particles and the honing tool, it is recognized that any number of plating      steps may be utilized to achieve the desired bond between the abrasive      particles and the particular substrate, and any number of plating      processes may be utilized to achieve the desired anti-stick, anti-galling      coating thickness. It is also recognized that the above-described process      may likewise be utilized for plating any abrasive material, not      necessarily a super abrasive material, onto a honing tool or other      substrate. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 illustrates one embodiment 32 of many possible embodiments of a      typical radially expandable type honing mandrel construction for which the      present invention likewise has particular utility. The honing mandrel 32      utilizes a plurality of circumferentially spaced work engaging members      such as the stone assemblies 34 and the shoe or guide assemblies 36, one      or more of such work engaging members 34 and 36 being radially adjustable      during a particular honing operation to maintain the stone and/or guide      assemblies in contact under pressure with a work surface being honed such      as the cylindrical work piece 40. In such constructions, the stone      assemblies perform the honing or grinding operations while the shoe or      guide assemblies stabilize the mandrel and provide support for the stone      assemblies. Many known stone and guide assemblies and stone and guide      assembly movement means have been devised and used to accomplish this      task. In the mandrel construction 32 illustrated in FIG. 7, a rack and      pinion gear arrangement 42 accounts for the radial movement of the work      engaging members 34 and 36. The stone assemblies 34 each include a work      engaging member 44 having an abrasive portion 46 associated therewith, the      work engaging member 44 being mounted on a backing member 48 which in turn      is attached to or mounted on a support structure 50. In such a honing      mandrel construction, the present anti-galling composite coating 28 could      be applied over the bond already established between the abrasive portion      46 and the member 44 to achieve the aforementioned objectives. </PAR><PAR>  Referring again to FIG. 7, the guide assemblies 36 each include a backing      or support portion 52 having a relatively non-abrasive upstanding work      engaging member 54 projecting upwardly from the backing member 52 as      shown. Since the guide assemblies 36 function to stabilize and provide      backing for the hones on the mandrel 32 during a honing operation, the      work engaging guide members 54 are preferably constructed of a relatively      inexpensive malleable or ductile material such as materials that include      zinc or zinc alloys which is characterized by being relatively      non-abrasive and more likely to slide on a work surface than to abrade it.      Zinc is also a relatively easy material to cast and is generally preferred      although other relatively non-abrasive materials such as bronze, brass and      certain plastic materials could be used for this application. Since shoe      or guide assemblies make contact with the work surface to be honed, and      since such assemblies are specifically designed to be as non-abrasive as      possible, it is also anticipated and recognized that the present      anti-galling composite coating 28 could likewise be applied over the top      of the work engaging surface of the guide members 54 such as the work      engaging guide surfaces 56 (FIG. 7) to even further reduce the friction      coefficient of such surfaces. This provides a smooth, anti-stick,      anti-galling coating over the top of the work engaging guide assembly and      further ensures against the problems of galling and scoring of the honed      work surface. Still other uses and applications of the present invention      to provide anti-stick and anti-gall properties to a work engaging surface      during a honing operation are recognized and anticipated. </PAR><PAR>  The present method represents an important advancement in the honing art in      that it substantially reduces and alleviates the above-identified problems      of galling and scoring of the honed work surface thereby increasing the      quality of the finished work product and it also increases the overall      service life of the tool. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, there has been shown and described a novel method for plating super      abrasive materials onto a honing tool as well as an improved honing tool      construction produced thereby, which method and tool fulfill all of the      objects and advantages sought therefor. Many changes, modifications,      variations, and other uses and applications of the present method and tool      will, however, become apparent to those skilled in the art after      considering this specification and the accompanying drawings. All such      changes, modifications, variations, and other uses and applications which      do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention are deemed to be      covered by the invention which is limited only by the claims which follow. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
