<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-66-0802 </DOCNO><TEXT>Research and development has been carried out since 1983 in pursuit ofa 20 kW/class total sistem consisting of a high-efficiency wind turbine,wind energy conversion equipment and energy storage equipment. In particular,efforts have been focused on tests for durability, stability and reliabilityand studies seeking reduced costs. The present report outlines the developmentand testing of a 20 kW-class linear-blade, vertical-shaft wind turbine.In designing the wind turbine, calculations are made to determine, inaddition to the strength of the turbine unit itself, the natural frequencyof the turbine unit and the support tower. Such calculations are requiredto avoid their resonance during operation. The wind turbine, connectedto the power conversion equipment, is operated continuously for fourhours under natural wind velocity and shaft output power. Results indicatethat the targeted controllability and output characteristics are achievedas expected. Inspection made six years after the installation detectsno significant defects. Further studies are required to develop operationsoftware for a higher operation efficiency and to achieve reduced costsand higher durability. (12 figs, 1 tab, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
