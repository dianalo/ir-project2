Iran's 83-member Council of Experts, formed in 1983 to designatea successor to Khomeini, selected Grand Ayatollah Hussein-AliMontazeri two years later.   Khomeini apparently went along with that choice, but many Iranianleaders opposed it. Khomeini last year made out a new politicaltestament, to be opened after his death, in which he reportedlyindicated that he now prefers that a triumvirate of senior figuresrun Iran after his demise.   Since the cease-fire, there have been persistent reports thathundreds, possibly thousands, of dissidents have been executed,including supporters of Montazeri, in an apparent effort toeliminate opposition in the aftermath of Iran's sudden collapse inthe war.   Khomeini's grudging acceptance of a cease-fire, at Rafsanjani'surging, embittered many hardliners even if it came as a relief tomany other Iranians.   Rafsanjani, who is also acting commander-in-chief and Montazeri'smain rival, is considered to be behind the current crackdown.   It is thought to be the most severe since the regimesystematically wiped out its leftist and liberal allies in 1981 whentens of thousands of people were believed to have been killed.   Yet it has come hand-in-hand with a general move to liberalizeIran's repressive political structure. Several Iranian leaders havecalled for greater freedom of expression and a greater role for thelong-suppressed private sector in the economy.   The government has passed a law allowing the formation ofpolitical parties, provided they don't conspire against the regime.   Even hardline radicals such as Mohtashemi, an increasinglypowerful figure, and Intelligence Minister Mohammad Rey-Shahri, havejoined this chorus.   Many see this sudden outbreak of tolerance, particularly amongthe radicals, to be little more than an effort by the variousfactions to consolidate their power bases for the battle for thesuccession they all see coming.   ``There is no external threat to the regime, despite the noisesmade by opposition groups in exile, but after the war, it's notsurprising that the regime would direct people's thought toward aninternal threat,'' Robbins noted.   Despite bitter opposition, Rafsanjani's policy of buildingbridges to the West and Iran's suspicious Arab neighbors in the gulfis seen as a triumph of pragmatism over revolutionary fanaticism.   Rafsanjani stressed in a keynote statement recently thatrevolutionary fervor had led Iran to make ``many mistakes'' in theearly days of the revolution.   ``We have learned not to create unnecessary obstructions,'' hesaid. ``We should not embark on making enemies for ourselves.''   In a speech soon after, Rafsanjani echoed other leaders bycalling on some of the hundreds of thousands of educated Iranianswho are among the 2 million who have fled since 1979 to return hometo help in postwar reconstruction.   ``If we improve conditions, if we give up some of theshort-sightedness, some of the excesses and some of the crudeaspects which were the requirements of the early stages of therevolution, and that we have no need of nowadays, we will be able toattract them back to the country,'' he said.   Montazeri, who has long advocated greater freedom of expression,possibly so his voice could be heard in media largely controlled byRafsanjani, noted in a speech to Islamic students: ``If we do nottolerate listening to views opposed to ours, those oppositionremarks will soon be turned into bullets.''   For most Iranian leaders, this is a remarkable turnaround fromthe inflammatory exhortations to the world's 800 million Moslems torise up in the name of a resurgent Islam, as well as Tehran'slong-maintained drive to export its revolution.   ``They've had to compromise their Islamic revolutionaryprinciples to get international economic help to rebuild thecountry,'' Robbins said. ``It's a sign of political maturity.''   Postwar Iran's first major political test will come in August,when the fourth presidential election will be held. Khamenei, whohas served two terms, cannot run for a third under the constitution.   Rafsanjani, whose political cunning has earned him the nicknameof ``the shark,'' is understood to be pressing for constitutionalreforms to give the presidency greater executive power and installone of his allies.   The presidency is just one of several competing power centers inTehran, a situation that has complicated the contradictory trendswithin the hierarchy.   Analysts agree that until the power struggle is settled and acoherent leadership emerges, Iran faces further convulsions.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 5</NOTE></DOC>
