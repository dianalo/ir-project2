Ramzi Salman, head of the State Oil Marketing Organization, toldthe weekly newsletter that Iraq's new oil capacity ``will help tomake people think twice before violating the agreement.''   ``A year ago we did not have that flexibility or that potential,but now we have it and should there be a political decision to useit, we can use it,'' Salman said.   He said Iraq could now export more than 4 million barrels a day,well over its Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries dailyquota of 2.92 million barrels for the last quarter of this year.   Export capacity ``will be developed to bigger volumes and Idon't think producing 4 million barrels is a problem,'' he said.   He stressed Iraq's continued commitment to the OPEC agreementsand its desire for firm oil prices, adding: ``We are not interestedin lower prices ... revenue maximization is the objective.''   The comments by Salman were carried in an interview published bythe Nicosia-based newsletter.   His warning came at a time when the cartel's 13 member nationsare exceeding their production limits under the OPEC agreement.   The International Energy Agency said in its monthly Oil MarketReport last week that OPEC pumped about 22.3 million barrels ofcrude a day in September, the same as in August, while theproduction ceiling was set at 19.5 million.   The cartel has decided to boost production by 1 million barrelsa day for the last quarter of the year, raising its overall statedproduction to 20.5 million. This is still nearly 2 million lowerthat the actual August-September production level.   The average price of oil has hovered around $16.82 a barrel, asmonitored by OPEC in the last week of September, compared to OPEC'starget of $18.   Iraq's increased export capacity followed the completion of asecond phase of a pipeline across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea portof Yanbu, raising the line's capacity to 1.65 million barrels a day.   That is in addition to a pipeline through Turkey to theMediterranean that also can carry 1.65 million barrels a day, andthe reopening of the Al Bakr terminal on the Persian Gulf.   The terminal was damaged during the eight-year war with Iran but50 percent of its original capacity has been restored and it nowcan handle at least 800,000 barrels a day, Salman said.</TEXT></DOC>
