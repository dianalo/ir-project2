But a recent finding by the Department ofCommerce that the Japanese are selling the devices below their cost ofmanufacture, i.e. dumping, has set off a pitched battle between opposing U.S.camps in and around the computer industry. Curiously, the U.S. computer giantsare siding with their Japanese competitors against a handful of small U.S.firms that make flat panels.;    Commerce's finding has galvanized theJapanese into damage-limitation operations, including last week's surpriseannouncement that Sharp Corp. will begin flat-panel assembly in Washingtonstate. The U.S. computer giants, who will have to pay higher prices toincorporate Japanese screens into their systems, are clearly unhappy. Theentire neo-classical economic establishment, which hates the very idea of fairtrade laws, is wringing its hands in despair. However, the case presents aunique opportunity to save a critical industry, and in doing so, to forge anew government-business alliance to ensure the United States' economic future.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FLAT-PANEL CASE ACTS AS PARADIGMU.S. NEEDS TO SAVE CRITICAL INDUSTRY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  ViewpointsKevin L. Kearns, a former State Department official, is a fellow at theEconomic Strategy Institute in Washington.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The eight tiny U.S. companies that comprise the flat-panel display industryare developing a technology that will help revolutionize our world once itstechnical problems are fully solved. Flat-panel displays have pushed theamazing shrinkage of computers from luggables to lap-tops to palm-tops.;   The United States' flat-panel display manufacturers are prime examples of thetype of entrepreneurship that public policy should be championing as a sourceof economic growth rather than abandoning to foreign dumping. So far, thedisplay makers have faced alone the deep pockets and brute-force businesspractices of the Japanese behemoths: Sharp, Toshiba, Hitachi, Matsushita, NEC,Saiko, Fujitsu, Kyocera and Hosiden. In contrast, U.S. firms are small andobscure.;    The stakes in this struggle are immense. The market forflat-panel displays is expected to grow from $1.8 billion yearly in 1988 to$8.5 billion a year by 1996 and then expand even faster. The firms that winthe race will realize untold billions in profits and wield vast economic andtechnological power.;    The event that prompted the anti-dumping suitoccurred in September 1989 when Apple Computer Inc., which prides itself onbeing a U.S. entrepreneurial company, introduced with much fanfare theMacintosh Portable. A highly touted element of the portable Mac was itsflat-display screen, manufactured by Hosiden of Japan.;    The advanced screenmarked the commercial introduction of a new generation of liquid-crystaldisplays known as &quot;active matrix.&quot; However, the production technology foractive-matrix screens has not been mastered, and the failure rate forlap-top-sized screens is extremely high. A manufacturing &quot;yield&quot; of only 20percent non-defective screens is considered extraordinary. Thus astronomicalnumbers of the screens have to be produced by Hosiden to get enough workingmodels to meet Apple's demand. This practice stands laissez-faire economics onits head: The price that Apple is paying for the screens bears no relationwhatsoever to Hosiden's costs of manufacture.;    Japanese spokesmen and theU.S. firms they supply deny that the screens are selling well below cost.;   However, Japanese tactics were laid out bluntly in the December 1989 JapanEconomics Journal. Explaining a willingness to make such heavy investments inflat-panel production capacity at an early stage of the market, ToshibaExecutive Vice President Tsuyoshi Kawanishi said: &quot;We are prepared to acceptred ink for the first five to six years. From the experience of oursemiconductor business, we have learned that one has to take a long-termperspective.&quot;;    To those in Washington and Silicon Valley who witnessed theJapanese &quot;targeting&quot; and near destruction of the U.S. semiconductor industry,this statement spelled the end of the U.S. flat-panel makers. To the U.S.display manufacturers, familiar with the cost of producing this type ofscreen, the Apple-Hosiden pricing arrangement and Kawanishi's remarks signaledthe Japanese would not be taking any prisoners.;    Apple is hardly the onlyU.S. electronics firm to choose a Japanese rival as a key supplier. IBM, Sun,Compaq and others are highly dependent on Japanese manufacturers -- very oftenon their direct competitors. What explains this odd behavior? On an economiclevel, U.S. computer makers benefit. Purchasing the dumped Japanese productslowers the computer makers' costs and in turn their retail prices.;    Themore important question, however, is what happens to the U.S. computerindustry over the longer run? Once there are no U.S. makers of flat panels,the computer companies will be vulnerable to a host of Japaneseanti-competitive practices. The result will be higher prices and thewithholding of front-line technology that is critical to U.S. firms' abilityto compete.;    Despite the lessons of recent industrial history, the computermakers continue to forge links to Japanese firms. But what they don'tunderstand is that the Japanese -- and many others -- simply don't operateaccording to free trade rules. Because of the cross-ownership, internalsubsidies and no-cost capital that characterize the keiretsu system, Japanesecompanies inevitably outcompete their U.S. counterparts.;    Where do theflat-panel makers stand in the wake of the Commerce Department finding? Thetiny U.S companies are just barely alive. Whatever the technology and qualityadvantages the U.S. producers hold, the Japanese dumping price has left themwithout the profits they need to reinvest in continued Randamp;D and factories andthereby assure their long-run survival. However, a positive decision in thedumping case can change the situation dramatically if the U.S. government andthe factions within the U.S. electronics industry put aside their differencesand work together to ensure a continued U.S. capacity in this key industry.;   The industry has three crucial needs: an infusion of cash, advancedmanufacturing technology and a level playing field on which to compete. In anexchange for a suspension of the anti-dumping duties, the first twonecessities could be supplied by the Japanese companies guilty of the dumping.The money and the technology would be funneled to the industry by the U.S.government through a special mechanism.;    The other critical ingredient --market share for the U.S. display makers -- would have to be sorted out bylimiting Japanese market share and getting the U.S. computer giants toguarantee a certain percentage of their purchases from U.S. flat-panelproducers. This arrangement would function a lot like the currentsemiconductor agreement with Japan is supposed to work.;    The recent findingwill not save the flat-panel industry. It is only a first step. If the U.S.government and the electronics industry cannot put aside their ideologicalprejudices and individual interests to forge a new consensus, the UnitedStates will soon cede the display industry to Japan. The computer industrywill eventually follow, and with both will pass key components of economicstrength and world influence. This is an opportunity not to be cast asidelightly.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KEVIN L.
