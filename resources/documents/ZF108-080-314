Ltd., a Reading, U.K.-basedorganization that recommends standards for the UNIX operating systemenvironment and extensions.andP;  If it can promulgate a true standard, X/Open canhave a major impact on the workstation market.andP;  In an X/Open world of opensystems, price and support, not vendor, will become key.andP;  In such a world, acompany like London-based International Computers Ltd. (ICL), for example,would be able to offer a viable alternative to a Sun workstation by providingthe same level of support for a cheaper Japanese equivalent.andP;  So while ICLmay have to remain loyal to Sun today, it may not have to remain faithful toSun in the future.andM;Developments in CASE technology are also helping to shape the workstationworld.andP;  The complete CASE environment, including software tools for systemsanalysis and design, requires far better graphical editing capabilities thana mainframe can provide--capabilities that either PCs or workstations candeliver.andP;  The new generation of CASE tools, referred to as iCASE, aretherefore based on PCs.andP;  Indeed, PC or workstation hardware are the onlyobvious platforms for iCASE development; iCASE represents one of the fewclear opportunities for IBM's OS/2 workstation operating system.andP;  UNIX alsohas an equally good shot at this market since it was designed forprogrammers.andM;Future CASEandM;End users and not just programmers will benefit from the strides being madein object-oriented processing.andP;  The object-oriented approach, however, goesmuch deeper than the user interface by extending the concept of informationbeyond the record-oriented data mentality of traditional computerapplications.andM;The growing demand for information retrieval systems is fueling the need forflexibility to handle nonrecord-oriented objects, such as documents andimages.andP;  Clearly there is no place for dumb alpha-numeric terminals inobject-oriented systems, which must have bit-mapped displays.andP;  Thedevelopment of object-oriented systems is therefore inextricably linked tothe development of cost-effective programmable workstations.andP;  Thearchitecture of workstations from NeXT Inc., for example, uses anobject-oriented design that facilities image storage and manipulation.andM;There is no doubt in my mind that, if we had a better operating system forthe PC than DOS, workstations could be completely integrated with mainframedatabases.andP;  Nevertheless, cooperative processing, in which part of theapplication resides on the host and part on the workstation, is a viableoption for users.andP;  Under this scenario, users have access to multipledatabases, possibly distributed.andM;Cooperative processing demands a full-function workstation with peer-to-peercommunications.andP;  And it also requires 486 boxes, bringing the market back tominicomputer, multiuser concepts.andP;  I suspect that ASCII visual display unit(VDU) multiuser systems will take the lower end of the business market awayfrom today's minis or PC-based local area networks.andP;  But this will notprovide the graphical interface corporations need.andM;Therefore, the workstation wheel will turn full circle as the market movesback to graphics terminals.andP;  This time, however, the new breed of terminalswill be based on the proper architectures and on high-speed LAN connectivity.andO;The key product for graphics interfaces today is X-Windows, which handlesdisplay, keyboard, pointing devices and a message-passing protocol thatoperates between the application and the software itself.andP;  X-Windows canco-reside inside a workstation with the application or it can be housed in aphysically separate device.andP;  An X-Windows terminal, for example, can beconnected to the applications server which, in turn, can connect to adatabase server.andP;  That means that multiple, low-cost X-Windows terminals canshare one or more high-performance 486 UNIX application servers.andM;So, an X-Windows terminal can be a specially made box or even software on acheap PC.andP;  Nonetheless, problems still remain because the world of X-Windows,UNIX and the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) muststill be merged with the IBM world of Systems Network Architecture (SNA) andToken Ring.andP;  This merger would integrate UNIX with traditional mainframeenvironments.andM;Nontechnological ConcernsandM;Several research projects now under way also promise to have ramificationsfor worldwide workstation wares.andP;  Two of these research efforts are beingconducted in the United States--one at Pittsburgh-based Carnegie MellonUniversity (CMU) and one at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)in Cambridge, Mass.andP;  Significant developments have already emerged from bothresearch efforts--X-Windows at MIT and the Mach workstation operating systemat CMU.andM;One aim of both projects is to provide one workstation per user on campus.andO;So far, CMU's Andrew project has had limited success in that regard, mainlybecause there haven't been enough workstations to cover the entire studentpopulation.andP;  Interestingly, the machines of choice on the campus have beenMacintoshes from Apple Computer Inc., not systems based on UNIX, the subjectof intense research at CMU.andM;Funding for MIT's Athena project comes primarily from Digital Equipment Corp.andO;and IBM, which furnish free machines.andP;  This vendor slant already suggests aconclusion that downgrades engineering workstations.andP;  Nevertheless, theproject is well organized, provides a consistent UNIx environment and a rangeof consistent applications and compilers.andP;  An Ethernet backbone linksworkstations to file servers and virtual disks on DEC VAXs.andM;Possibly more influential than either of these two U.S.andP;  projects is theSoftware Industrial Generalization and Maintenance Aids, or SIGLMA, effortlaunched by the Japanese.andP;  As part of this effort, a UNIX-based workstationhas been designed and distributed to selected Japanese companies.andP;  Althoughthe SIGMA operating system will be compatible with X/Open's UNIX and POSIX,it will also include specific Japanese extensions.andM;A major objective of the SIGMA project is to encourage Japanhs fleet ofthird-party software developers.andP;  If they are successful, the stage could beset for a Japanese assault on the engineering workstation market currentlydominated by U.S.andP;  suppliers.andP;  Given their track record, the Asian nationcould get the price right, and thus create a general-purpose workstationsector--to the envy of every workstation vendor.andM;Martin Healey is chairman of the board of Technology Concepts Ltd. inCwmbran, South Wales.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
