Mulheren Jr. took the stand in his owndefense, testifying that he never made illegal arrangementsto buy securities from Ivan F. Boesky.   Mr. Mulheren's assertions contradicted previous testimonyby Mr. Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator whosecooperation led to the government's sweeping insider-tradinginvestigation and to the government's case against Mr.Mulheren. The 40-year-old Mr. Mulheren is charged with 41counts of conspiracy, securities and mail fraud and keepingfalse records.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Mulheren's testimony was also contrary to evidenceprovided during the trial, which began a month ago, by twoother government witnesses. Those witnesses were MichaelDavidoff, a key aide to Mr. Boesky, and Edward McCarthy, apartner in Mr. Mulheren's former trading firm, JamieSecurities Co.   Messrs. Boesky, Davidoff and McCarthy had previouslytestified that Mr. Mulheren conducted a series of trades thatwere designed to generate tax losses for Mr. Boesky's tradingfirm and to help Mr. Boesky evade net capital requirements.They testified that Mr. Boesky's company had agreed to sellsecurities to Mr. Mulheren's firm with the understanding thatthose securities would later be repurchased. Messrs. Davidoffand McCarthy said that profits and losses from the tradeswere to be borne by Mr. Boesky's company.   But yesterday, Mr. Mulheren said he had no suchunderstanding of the trades. Mr. Mulheren said he repeatedlytold Mr. Davidoff, who was Mr. Boesky's chief trader, that hedidn't do &quot;those kinds of trades&quot; that didn't involve marketrisk and were illegal.   Mr. Mulheren, once a co-trustee of a trust for Mr.Boesky's children, testified that he met Mr. Boesky for thefirst time in 1976 in a Manhattan restaurant, where the twodined with their wives and Salim B. Lewis, a former WallStreet stock speculator. Mr. Mulheren said he recalled thatMr. Boesky seemed to be &quot;very smart, a little outlandish.&quot; Atthe dinner, Mr. Mulheren said, Mr. Boesky &quot;ordered most ofthe entrees on the menu and picked which one he wanted to eatafter he ordered&quot; from the selection of &quot;six to eight&quot;dishes.   Mr. Mulheren said that before he conducted the first ofthe allegedly illegal trades, in Unocal Corp. stock, Mr.Boesky phoned him in mid-1985 and asked if Mr. Mulheren coulddo Mr. Boesky a favor and buy stock. Mr. Mulheren said Mr.Davidoff then called him and said, &quot;I'm going to sell you&quot;330,000 shares of Unocal stock and &quot;I might want to buy itback.&quot; Mr. Mulheren said Mr. Davidoff assured him that Mr.Boesky would cover any losses Mr. Mulheren might suffer as aresult of owning the shares. &quot;I said, `Stop right there. Idon't do these trades,'&quot; Mr. Mulheren said he told Mr.Davidoff.   Mr. Mulheren said he bought the stock without anyunderstanding that Mr. Boesky would cover losses.   However, in earlier testimony, Mr. McCarthy offeredevidence counter to Mr. Mulheren's statement. Mr. McCarthysaid that Mr. Mulheren had directed him to keep the Unocalposition separate on Jamie Securities' financial statementbecause it belonged to Mr. Boesky -- and not to Jamie.Yesterday Mr. Mulheren denied that he had ever asked that theposition be kept separate.   Mr. Mulheren later sold the Unocal shares on the openmarket. Messrs. Davidoff and McCarthy have testified that hewas directed to sell the shares by Mr. Boesky, an assertionMr. Mulheren denied yesterday.   Mr. Mulheren testified that he was later asked to buyother securities as a favor to Mr. Boesky, which he did. Hesaid he never agreed to have Mr. Boesky bear the risk ofthose trades.   In earlier testimony, Messrs. Davidoff and McCarthy saidthat to compensate Mr. Boesky from securities he bought as afavor, Mr. Mulheren proposed a scheme in late 1985 underwhich Jamie would inflate brokerage bills it paid to Mr.Boesky's trading company. Mr. Mulheren, who didn't have anopportunity to respond to this allegation yesterday, isexpected to continue his testimony today.</TEXT></DOC>
