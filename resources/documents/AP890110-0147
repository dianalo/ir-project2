Public speeches evoke horrifying images of children frozen inanguished death from poison gas, but national interests clash overwhat to do about it.   Attention focused Tuesday on Arab demands to link a chemicalweapons treaty with a nuclear ban. This and deep-seated conflictsparalyzed movement toward what American and French organizers hopedwould be consensus.   Even if wording is found for a political declaration in Paris,several delegates said, the implications are not promising fornegotiations in Geneva that have made little headway toward a treatyin 10 years.   ``Export controls on chemicals and technology are just toosensitive for the Third World,'' said a senior U.S. delegate, wholike most others interviewed declined to be identified. ``They won'thave it. This means we can't expect anything with teeth in it.''   American negotiators want tough export controls to stop WestGermans and other Europeans from selling chemicals that can beblended into poison gas, or from providing the expertise needed towage chemical warfare.   The Germans want provisions for rapid challenge inspections,which Washington says are inconclusive and pose a problem in theUnited States, where local courts protect access to private property.   There also is disagreement over ``dual use precursors,'' orchemicals that are essential to poison gases but also useful forpesticides or even medicine.   ``Let us not be fooled; there are economic interests at stakehere,'' said an expert in the American delegation. A West Germanofficial made a similar remark, referring to the Americans.   In the corridors, spokesmen from several delegations spoke ofinconsistencies of their rivals.   On Tuesday, three days after Secretary of State George P. Shultzappealed for ``consciousness raising'' to abolish chemical weapons,West German reporters noted the new American budget provides for twonew chemical weapons plants.   Some Middle Eastern countries and nations that professnon-alignment clearly were stalling to be able to keep chemicalarsenals, and others that favored a ban had conflicting interests,Western delegates said.   Roberto de Abreu Sodre, the Brazilian foreign minister, told theconference no accord should hamper the economic and social progressof nations, ``a process in which the chemical industry certainlyplays an important role.''   He echoed the popular argument for banning chemical and nuclearweapons simultaneously: Nations without nuclear capacity should notbe stripped of their only deterrent.   In an interview later, he said Brazil opposed chemical weaponsbut was raising concerns heard among delegates of advanceddeveloping countries.   Newly industrialized countries produce not only chemicals butweapons systems, and several are suspicious of measures that mightlimit them as competitors or allow international access to theirtrade secrets.   African states worry as much about toxic wastes dumped byindustrial countries as about the threat of chemical weapons intheir region.   ``We have been chosen as a dumpsite for these dangeroussubstances and we must guard against this,'' said Mamadou Dagra ofNiger.   Soviet arms negotiator N.P. Smidovitch, asked in an interviewwhat Moscow did not want to see in the Paris declaration, replied:   ``I can't think of anything we would object to. This is apolitical conference and we should have a consensus document.''   Nicaraguan delegate Julio Icasa told The Associated Press:   ``We don't agree with the Arab League position to link chemicaland nuclear weapons. We just want to rid the world of this stuff.''   Asked whether anyone in Central America had chemical weapons, helaughed and said: ``Only the asphyxiating gas of debt and the poisonof U.S. intervention.''</TEXT></DOC>
