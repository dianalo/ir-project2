Finance Ministry officials said Wednesday a new law givingauthorities greater investigatory and surveillance powers overstock deals could be gradually implemented as early as this month.   Criminal punishment clauses will take effect next April,officials in the ministry's Securities Bureau said. The measureswere to be implemented in gradual steps beginning Nov. 1.   Although the officials gave no reasons for moving up enactmentof the Revised Securities and Exchange Law _ Japan's first todirectly address insider trading _ securities and legal expertssaid growing public attention on recent stock scandals spurred thedecision.   The most famous of these, ``Recruit-Gate,'' has been the subjectof intense parliamentary debate in recent days. Aides to toppoliticians including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita reportedlybought shares of the Recruit-Cosmos real estate firm before publictrading began and made substantial profits when prices rose later.   There is wide skepticism about any real impact the newlegislation may have on insider trading, which experts describe ascommon in Japanese stock dealings.   Brokers routinely advise clients on stock deals based on insideinformation and frequently use the information in their owntransactions. Companies inform corporate shareholders in advanceabout announcements that may affect share prices in order tomaintain good business relations.   ``I can't say the new law will have an overnight impact on ...insider trading in Japan, where most stock dealings are more orless based on inside information,'' said Keisuke Matsuura, aprivate investor who has followed the Tokyo stock market for morethan 30 years.   ``But at least people who are unconsciously indulging in insidertrading today won't be able to get away by saying, `Gee, I didn'tknow it was insider trading' after the law is implemented,'' hesaid.   Legal experts expressed concern about the government'sinvolvement in investigating and monitoring stock deals.   ``The Finance Ministry is not an independent body like theSecurities and Exchange Commission in the United States, which isfree from all political obligations, and there is no guarantee itsregulation won't be affected by political interests,'' said HiroshiItakura, a criminal law professor at Nihon University.   ``We can probably expect the ministry to pinpoint minor insidertrading cases, but I can't believe it would attack cases involvingtop politicians.''   Experts said securities regulatory authorities _ the FinanceMinistry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange _ need the greaterinvestigatory and surveillance functions, even if only to send amessage.   The Tokyo stock market has been rocked by a series of scandalsin recent months. Despite public outcry for stringent measures toregulate insider trading, the Finance Ministry has not been able tobring criminal charges against players in any of the controversies.   Between October 1986 and September 1987, the Tokyo exchange'sDealing Review Section investigated 252 transactions it deemedsuspicious, but failed to prove any criminal wrongdoing.   The move toward tougher controls was spawned last September. Ina widely publicized case, an Osaka-based bank sold large stockholdings in a chemical company shortly before it was announced thecompany had suffered huge losses in stock speculations. No criminalpunishment was meted out despite the disclosure that the Hyogo SogoBank knew about the losses in advance.   At the urging of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,the Finance Ministry in February agreed to implement stiffer lawsto control fraudulent stock activities.   SEC chairman David Ruder, who was visiting Tokyo in February,said then the legislation covered ``98 percent of what the U.S. lawcovers.'' Parliament approved it in May and it was slated forgradual enactment beginning in November.   Revelations of the Recruit-Cosmos deals broke early this summerand quickly escalated into a scandal. And while Parliament debatedthe ethical aspects of that case last week, stock watchers notedthe share price of the Tokyo precision machinery firm Sankyo Seikiskyrocketed shortly before the announcement of its corporate tie-upwith Nippon Steel Co.   Experts said there was a leak, but Tokyo Stock Exchange chairmanMichio Takeuchi said it will be difficult to verify wrongdoing.Kyodo News Service reported Wednesday that exchange officialsstrongly suspected ``questionable transactions'' took place.   Finance Ministry officials said they were awaiting the resultsof the exchange's probe and would take appropriate measures.</TEXT></DOC>
