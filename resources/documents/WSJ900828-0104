Several top schools report that recruiting fell off thispast spring, as some companies lowered hiring goals andstrung along prospects longer. As a result, job hunts formany graduates &quot;were much more stretched out and tougher tomanage,&quot; says Jeanne J. Husain, director of placement at theUniversity of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.   And when decisions did come in, &quot;people tended not to siton their offers as long as they had in the past,&quot; adds JamesJ. Beirne of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School,where 309 companies came calling this academic year, downfrom 335 a year earlier.   The biggest slide occurred among struggling computermakers; at Carnegie Mellon's business school, Apple ComputerInc., Data General Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. canceledcampus interviews this year, while International BusinessMachines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Inc. halved the number ofjobs they offered. &quot;We were just trying to match ourrecruiting efforts with what we felt our anticipated needswould be,&quot; says Hewlett-Packard's R. Kemp Bohlen.   The slump in the real estate industry and among WallStreet investment banks also hurt. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., forone, hired 49 new M.B.A.s this spring, down from 62 lastyear.   Recruiting activity wasn't down universally. Commercialbanks, consumer-products makers and consulting firmsmaintained strong interest in M.B.A.s.   At the University of Rochester's Simon School of Business,the number of recruiting companies even rose -- to 109 from101 last year. The school credits tougher application rulesthat have boosted the work experience -- and allure -- of itsgraduates. But the news isn't all good. Starting pay forSimon graduates rose just 3.2%, to nearly $44,500, followinga 9.2% jump last year.                                                                                                          Widely Used Test Gets   More Flunking Grades                                                                                                          AFTER BEING used to screen millions of job applicants inrecent decades, a government workplace test is rapidlyfalling out of favor.   The U.S. Department of Labor is proposing suspension ofthe General Aptitude Test Battery, which it developed in the1940s for state and local employment offices. The officeshave used the test to help place people in government andprivate jobs, including blue-collar positions with manyFortune 500 companies.   Criticism of the test began in the 1980s, after thedepartment implemented a new grading system that effectivelyboosted the scores -- and job chances -- of minorities. TheJustice Department challenged that arrangement, charging itcould result in reverse discrimination against whites. Lastyear, the National Research Council endorsed the scoringpractice, but questioned the GATB's structure and validity.   At its height five years ago, the exam was taken by nearlytwo million people annually in 44 states. Some 35 states wereusing it when the suspension was proposed last month, but ahandful have since dropped it and more may follow. Pending afinal decision by year end, the department is planning toreview the exam -- and perhaps overhaul it.   &quot;We're going to mount a vigorous look at what thisinstrument is doing in today's labor market,&quot; says Robert J.Litman, deputy director of the department's EmploymentService.   Government job offices have other tests to gauge skillslike typing, but without the GATB they are expected to relymore on those mainstays of assessment, interviews andreference checks.                                                                                                          Where the Jobs Are:   At Troubled Firms                                                                                                          AS SAVINGS and loans fail and leveraged buy-outs go sour,the demand for executives to help run troubled companies isgrowing.   This year, says Windle Priem, a recruiter with Korn/FerryInternational, half his searches involve distressedinstitutions, mostly banks and thrifts. That's up from 20%two years ago. But the industry's turmoil is reducingexecutives' enthusiasm for moving. As a result, Mr. Priemadds, troubled organizations are successful only if theyoffer prospects a higher-ranked position, a minimum 30%increase in cash compensation, &quot;three or four times&quot; annualsalary in stock options and an employment contract.   Some look for restless targets, someone &quot;with a troubledcompany himself, or one of hundreds of senior staff people&quot;made redundant by mergers, says J. Gerald Simmons, presidentof recruiter Handy Associates.   When recruiting new managers for Western Union Corp.,which is embroiled in labor disputes and has flirted with abankruptcy-law filing, Chairman Robert Ammon soughtrisk-takers. &quot;I tended to take people who started theircareers in large companies, but who were also {heads} ofstart-ups . . . and maybe had some experiences that got theirnoses bloodied a bit.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          WORDS vs. action: Some 92% of companies consider itcritical to teach employees new skills, but just 23% do thatto &quot;a great or very great extent,&quot; finds a survey of 167companies by the American Society for Training andDevelopment. . . .
