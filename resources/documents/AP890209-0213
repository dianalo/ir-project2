Danny Wall told a meeting of international bankers Wednesday.   Wall also said the government actively would seek restitutionfrom fraudulent thrift executives, whose actions have contributed tothe industry's losses, said to be accruing at the rate of $500million a month.   He said the $90 billion bailout plan announced this week byPresident Bush does not signal the demise of a financial institutioncreated in the 1930s to help Americans buy single-family homes.   Wall, who is from South Dakota, said there were ``thousands ofbanks'' in that part of the country whose business was much the sameas thrifts, which traditionally have catered to individualdepositors or mortgage seekers.   ``Over time, I'm convinced we should allow those kinds ofinstitutions to borrow from federal home loan banks,'' he said.   Wall said the plan for dealing with the hundreds of troubledthrifts includes a reversal of a Federal Reserve ban on allowingbank holding companies to own thrifts.   Under the plan, which must be approved by Congress, banks wouldbe allowed to absorb insolvent thrifts immediately and acquirehealthy institutions beginning in 1991.   ``We are overruling the Fed, legally,'' Wall said, adding that heexpected banks to enter the thrift industry as soon as they areallowed to.   Wall told a meeting of the Institute of International Bankersthat the expected infusion of investment money from banks wouldinvigorate and perhaps save the thrift industry.   One of the possible results of the plan is the eventual merger ofthe banking and savings and loan industries. Savings institutionshave lower capital requirements than banks, a practice that would bemodified under the government plan.   Wall said he supported Bush's proposals, which include abolishingthe three-member Federal Home Loan Bank Board that regulates thenation's 3,100 thrifts. The bank board's regulatory apparatus wouldbe placed under the supervision of the Treasury Department.   The plan also would place the insolvent Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., which insures thrift deposits, under authority ofthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures deposits atcommercial banks and regulates the 8,000 state-chartered banks.   Wall also pledged to crack down on thrift institution fraud, andcited a $50 million infusion of money under the Bush plan to beef upfederal prosecution of such crimes.   He said the bank board, which does not have the power toprosecute cases, last year obtained $100 million in settlements,excluding a $50 million malpractice settlement with a Philadelphialaw firm involved in the failure of a Florida thrift that has yet tobe paid.</TEXT></DOC>
