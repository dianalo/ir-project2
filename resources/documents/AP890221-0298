The non-OPEC group, after a daylong meeting in London, released astatement saying more information was forthcoming but did notdisclose details of the agreement or say which countries wouldparticipate.   ``Specific announcements with respect to the above decisions willbe made by the respective authorities in the course of next week,''the group said in a statement.   Participating in the talks at the Mexican Embassy were Mexico,Oman, Malaysia, Egypt, China, and Angola, the communique said. Alsoattending were observers from the Soviet Union, Colombia, NorthYemen, Norway, Alaska and the Canadian province of Alberta, it said.   Oil analysts said the agreement would help bolster oil prices inthe short-term. But they added that such cuts would have littleimpact on the buoyant supply and weak demand in the oil market.   There was little immediate reaction in the London oil market.After the communique was released, the spot price of North Sea BrentBlend, the most widely traded international crude oil, was $16.30 abarrel, up 10 cents from late Monday.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell by about15 cents following the announcement.   Analysts said the lack of details about the agreement pressuredthe market.   The agreement ``is fairly significant,'' said Philip Morgan, anoil analyst with the London investment firm Citicorp ScrimgeourVickers. ``I think it means the extension of the oil producers'cartel, even if the countries don't want to commit themselves toOPEC at this stage.''   It also was significant that the independent producers wereacting unilaterally, analysts said. They were doing so because theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has managed to curbits production, they said.   Last year, independent oil producers offered to cut their outputby 5 percent, if OPEC agreed to reciprocal cuts. OPEC refused.   Some OPEC members have expressed resentment that independentproducers enjoy the benefits of the cartel's production limitswithout making a contribution.   OPEC's 13 members are estimated to be producing about 19.5million barrels a day, one million barrels above their agreedproduction limit but well below their fourth-quarter production.OPEC has set a target price of $18 a barrel.   ``The psychological impact (on the oil markets) will be quitestrong,'' Morgan said. But, ``I think the total volume of the cutsmakes little difference to the whole supply and demand question.''   James Henderson, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. inLondon, said, ``Basically, we see it as fairly positive for the oilprice short-term.   ``Basically, it will help OPEC through the seasonal demanddownturn in the second quarter. We still see a dip in the oil pricebut not as dramatically as it would have been.''   Henderson predicted oil prices would fall to $14.50 to $15 abarrel in March and April.   The analyst said he expects the independent producers to cutexports by between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels a day.   ``A cut of 100,000 (cq) to 300,000 isn't going to have a dramaticeffect on the supply and demand balance,'' Henderson said.   The communique also said some participants ``will go back totheir authorities for further consultations in order to determinetheir contribution.''   ``Further meetings of technical experts will be convened on aregular basis in order to monitor the evolution of the marketsituation as well as compliance with the agreement,'' the statementsaid.   The group set May 16 for the next meetig to ``address theprospects of the second half of the year, a period viewed by theexperts with caution.''   Individual delegates would not elaborate when they emerged fromthe meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
