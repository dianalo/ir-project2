In what could be the first of a series of votes in the comingweeks, the House on Tuesday approved an amendment that would cutoff the flow of public funds to federal and private-sectorworkplaces with illegal drug problems.   The amendment was tacked onto the first fiscal 1989appropriations bill to reach the House floor _ a $17.8 billionpackage to finance the Department of Energy and water developmentprojects by the Army Corps of Engineers and the InteriorDepartment's Bureau of Reclamation.   The spending bill was sent to the Senate by a 384-20 roll callshortly after the House voted 273-127 for the anti-drug amendmentoffered by Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa.   Walker said the ban would apply to federal offices covered bythe spending bill and private-sector companies holding governmentcontracts for such activities as research and construction.   ``There is nothing in this amendment that says you have to go todrug testing,'' said Walker, adding that he hopes to add theprovision to the 12 other fiscal 1989 appropriations bills headingtoward the House floor.   He said the major effect of the amendment would be to encourageprivate employers doing business with the federal government toadopt and enforce policies against drugs in their workplaces.   Walker said that with such a policy in place, an employer couldprobably avoid losing contract payments by convincing officialsthat an instance of on-the-job drug abuse was an aberration, not aregular occurrence.   The Pennsylvania lawmaker recently succeeded in convincingcolleagues on the Science and Technology Committee to add theanti-drug language to authorization bills for four agencies,including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and theNational Science Foundation.   Tuesday's vote was the first by the full House on the proposal.   Walker said he hopes to improve the language of the amendment toinclude provisions to establish procedures for cutting off moneybecause of workplace problems with drugs.   The amendment drew only brief debate before it was added tolegislation to finance energy and water development projects forthe year beginning Oct. 1.   The bill's floor manager, Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., said thepackage was $357 million below the Reagan administration's requestand was consistent with deficit-reduction agreement reached lastyear by the White House and congressional leaders.   The bill contains money to continue work on hundreds of dams,harbors and irrigation systems but, according to Bevill, none tobegin any new projects because of the budget deficit. Aides toBevill say they can't recall the last time an appropriations billcame to the floor without new projects.   The Office of Management and Budget disagrees with theno-new-starts description. Spokeswoman Barbara Clay said the billcontains eight new starts, although she notes OMB and Congressdisagree over what constitutes the start of construction.   Under any definition of a ``new start,'' the legislation ismodest, compared with past years when the annual ``pork-barrel''spending bill contained 20 or more construction starts.   Clay said that while the administration is ``not displeased''with the bill's price tag, it was unhappy because it bars the startof construction for the Super Collider, the huge physics projectfor research into basic matter.   Bevill said the prohibition was placed into the bill becauselawmakers want the next administration to decide whether to proceedwith a major undertaking that could cost from $4.4 billion to $9billion.</TEXT></DOC>
