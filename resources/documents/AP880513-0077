Of 2,000 randomly surveyed hospitals, 78.6 percent reported anursing shortage in April 1987, up 2.4 percent from a year earlier,the Chicago-based association said.   Large hospitals in urbans areas on both coasts were more acutelyaffected than smaller, rural institutions in the nation'smidsection.   To combat the nursing shortage, three out of four hospitalssurveyed relied on overtime for nursing staff and 41 percentemployed temporary or agency nurses.   Foreign nurses were recruited by 10 percent of hospitals,predominately larger hospitals in the East.   The association is a not-for-profit organization that serves asa national advocate for hospitals and informs the public abouthealth care issues.</TEXT></DOC>
