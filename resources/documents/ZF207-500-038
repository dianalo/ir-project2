Nelson contends thissystem could halt the widespread use of fraudulent documents by illegalaliens seeking work in the U.S.andP;  He is suggesting a system similar to creditcard checkers so employers would be required to verify documents viatelephone.andP;  &quot;The technology is available right now,&quot;  he told the New YorkTimes.andP;  &quot;We can easily adapt it.&quot;andM;VANISHING ACT.andP;  .  .A computer operator at Exxon's Houston headquarters hasbeen fired for inadvertently destroying computer copies of thousands ofdocuments with potentially important information relating to the Alaskan oilspill.andP;  Exxon, facing over 150 lawsuits as a result of the spill, isreportedly trying to track down other copies of the data.andP;  The ex-employee,however, says he is being used as a scapegoat and that none of the tapes heerased were labeled &quot;Do Not Destroy.&quot;andM;CHINA CONNECTION.andP;  .  .The BITNET and USENET networks became invaluablelifelines to the hundreds of thousands of U.S.-based Chinese  students duringthe rebellion in Beijing.andP;  Students from around the nation used the networksto post the latest information, usually before it appeared on television orin the newspapers.andP;  The computer networks were also used as effectivefundraising tools to collect donations to supply  Beijing students withmimeograph machines, typewriters and a photocopier.andM;DARPA TUNES IN HDTV.andP;  .  .Five companies have received the first DARPA grantsfor the development of high-definition television technology (HDTV) for bothconsumer and military applications.andP;  HDTV  technology, which experts predictwill be a $50-billion industry by the year 2000, is also expected to havewide applications in fields such as  personal computers, semiconductors andtelecommunications.andP;  DARPA allocated over $30 million in grants to NewcoInc., San Jose, Calif.; Raychem Corporation, Menlo Park, Calif.; TexasInstruments Inc., Dallas; and Projectavision Inc., New York.andM;SIFTING FOR NEWS.andP;  .  .An on-line service that offers a moderated andfiltered flow of information to the Internet and USENET networks has beenintroduced by Anterior Technology, Menlo Park, Calif.andP;  IN MODERATION NETWORKculls raw network discussions for precious news gems, according to presidentand founder Geoffrey Goodfellow.andP;  &quot;Only contributions  of value will bepassed on to subscriber sites,&quot; he says.andP;  Initial cost to participate in themoderated network is $720 annually per site.andM;FAXING FUTURE.andP;  .  .The market for products that send computer informationfrom a PC to a fax machine is drawing big guns like ATandamp;T, Western Union,CompuServe, Lotus and MCI.andP;  Not only do PC-to-fax products eliminate waitinglines for the company fax machine, they also allow users to transmit to up to1,000 fax machines simultaneously.andP;  Industry observers claim 25 percent ofall faxes will be sent via PC within the next five years.andM;DEATH OF A HACKER.andP;  .  .The body of a man found burned to death last Junenear Gifhorn, West Germany was identified as Karl Koch, a West Germancomputer hacker under investigation for his part in the computer spy scandalmaking headlines last March.andP;  Police say Koch apparently committed suicide bydousing himself with gasoline and setting himself on fire.andP;  Koch wassuspected of providing the Soviet KGB with code words to gain access towestern research and defense computers.andM;ECONOMICAL SUPER SYSTEMS.andP;  .  .NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View,Calif., and DARPA have successfully demonstrated a low-costparallel-processing computer with the potential of producing capabilitiesequivalent to the most advanced supercomputers available today.andP;  GeneralMicroelectronics, Inc. of San Diego developed the system now calledConfigurable Architecture Parallel Processing System (CAPPS).andP;  NASA claimsthe demonstration opens the possibility of dramatically improving the costeffectiveness of computers applicable for a host of aerospace applications.andM;TECHNOLOGY HUB.andP;  .  .The position of Under Secretary for Technology and aTechnology Administration have been formed at the U.S.andP;  Department ofCommerce to serve as a focal point for groups working to promote thecreation, production, and commercial success of technology-based  U.S.andP;  goodsand services.andP;  The new office will act as an advocate for government policiesand actions to speed technology transfer and remove  barriers to thecommercilization of new technologies by industry.andM;WHO'S ZOOMIN' WHO? .andP;  .In an effort to make television ratings more accurate,the A.C.andP;  Nielsen Co. and the David Sarnoff Research Center are developing anew ratings system with a sensor modeled after the human eye.andP;  Theoretically,the TV would watch the viewer watching TV.andP;   This &quot;passive-people-meter&quot;would record participants' images and then translate them into a set ofdistinguishing features.andP;  The data would be stored digitally in a TV-topcomputer the size of a VCR.andP;  The system should be in service by themid-1990s.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
