This country, this government and thisleader have more strength than appearances suggest.''   Graduates of the nation's only military academy spearheaded thesix armed attempts to topple Mrs. Aquino since she took power in theFebruary 1986 civilian-military uprising against President FerdinandMarcos.   Troops here and in Manila were placed on maximum alert in advanceof Sunday's commencement because of rumors that right-wingextremists would launch a new coup attempt.   Hundreds of troops, some of them flown here from Manila, guardedstrategic points near the mountain-top academy. Bomb-sniffing dogschecked cadets before the ceremony began under brillantly clearskies.   In March 1987, a bomb exploded on the academy parade ground a fewdays before the commencement, killing four people and injuring nineothers. Mrs. Aquino said the bomb was intended for her.   In her speech, Mrs. Aquino told the cadets it was their duty toprotect democratic gains from both communist rebels and right-wingextremists in their ranks.   ``Fight them wherever they appear and threaten our people, ourwork that we are striving to make of this country,'' she said.   She challenged the cadets to join with civilian authorities inhealing the nation's wounds and building democracy.   ``To the enemies of freedom, the armed opponents of ourgovernment on the left and the right, I address these words: Let ussit down and try to settle our differences by talk,'' she said.``And if we cannot, by all means, let us do so by arms. But let usnot infect the next generation in civil society and in the armedforces with narrow causes and hatreds of the past.''</TEXT></DOC>
