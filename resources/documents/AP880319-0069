The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Friday it would protectall depositors and general creditors of American Savings andamp; LoanAssociation, FCA's main subsidiary. Normally deposit accounts areonly insured up to $100,000.   The Irvine-based FCA, with $33.7 billion in assets, is thenation's second-largest thrift holding company and the biggestproblem for the bank board, which regulates 3,150 savingsinstitutions.   The pledge of support came after the company, in a report filedwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, said for the firsttime that American, based in Stockton, was insolvent undergenerally accepted accounting principles.   Karl Hoyle, a bank board spokesman, said the statement was madein part to stem the drain of deposits at American. The bank boardalso reaffirmed its support for the management of both the Sandamp;L andits parent.   FCA said American's net worth _ the difference between assetsand liabilities _ had fallen to negative $106 million at the end ofthe year, compared with positive $244.4 million on Sept. 30.   Under less stringent regulatory accounting guidelines,American's net worth was plus $69 million at the end of 1987,compared with $357.8 million at the end of the third quarter.   FCA had previously revealed that its net worth had fallen intothe red, but this is the first disclosure that net worth atAmerican has fallen below the zero mark. That happened whenAmerican concluded that repayment of debts due from its parentcompany were not assured.   FCA's annual report, filed with the SEC, also revealed thatdepositors withdrew $493 million during the first two months ofthis year. Deposits had totaled $17.1 billion at the end of 1987.   The company attributed the drain to publicity about the bank'sproblems and said it eased during the first 10 days of March.   The drain was milder than the severe run at American in Augustand September of 1984, when the bank lost about $6.8 billion of its$25 billion in deposits.   The bank board's sister agency for commercial banks, the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp., issued a similar promise on Thursdayprotecting all depositors and general creditors of FirstRepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, a bank holding company of about thesame size as FCA.   However, the FDIC went a step further than the bank board bypumping $1 billion into First RepublicBank.   FCA on Feb. 23 asked for $1.5 billion in assistance as soon aspossible from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the bank boardunit that guarantees deposits. Hoyle said the request is underreview.   The largest-ever government bailout of a banking company was the$4.5 billion rescue in 1984 of Continental Illinois Corp.   The bank board has tried unsuccessfully for nearly a year tofind another institution willing to take over all or part of FCA onterms that wouldn't be too costly. On-again, off-again talks withthe thrift unit of Ford Motor Co. broke down early in January.   On Jan. 27, FCA reported a loss of $224.6 million in the lastthree months of last year, bringing its 1987 loss to $468 million.   Two weeks later, the bank board ordered it to sell $2.5 billionin mortgage-backed securities to reduce its vulnerability tointerest rate fluctuations.   On March 9, the bank board passed a resolution reassuringnervous Wall Street firms, which had lent more than $12 billion toAmerican in the form of reverse repurchase agreements.   Ranked by assets, FCA is second among thrift holding companiesto H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co., the Los Angeles-based parent of HomeSavings of America.</TEXT></DOC>
