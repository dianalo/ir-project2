The United States considers such settlements in the West Bank andGaza Strip an obstacle to peace between Israel and its Arabneighbors.   Violence continued in the occupied territories, where a rebellionthat began Dec. 8, 1987, has cost the lives of 10 Israelis and morethan 300 Palestinians. Israeli soldiers blew up three Palestinianhouses Thursday and sealed another, and 11 Palestinians werereported wounded by army gunfire.   Sources in the Labor Party said Foreign Minister Shimon Peresmight be dumped as leader after the center-left party's poor showingin Tuesday's general election.   Critics say the Labor campaign focused too closely on Peres'personality and his support for an international conference onMiddle East peace, an Arab demand that stirs controversy in Israel.   Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, which has been in a tenuous``national unity'' government with Labor since indecisive 1984elections, opposes a conference and wants to retain all the landscaptured in the 1967 war. Peres has expressed willingness to tradesome land for peace.   Likud won 40 seats in the 120-member parliament, one more thanLabor, according to revised official figures that added one seat toeach party's total. Likud seeks to end its coalition with Labor andform an alliance with small religious and rightist parties.   Labor also has courted religious parties, but its chances for acoalition are considered slim.   Leaders of the National Religious Party, which has five seats, onThursday ruled out a coalition with the Labor Party and said theypreferred joining a government headed by the right-wing Likud bloc.   The 73-year-old prime minister expressed confidence Thursday thathe could form a government. ``I can't give an exact date, but I hopeit won't take long,'' he said on Israel television.   He completed a first round of coalition talks Thursday aftermeeting with the Moledet (Homeland) and Tzomet (Crossroads) parties,which want to annex the occupied territories. Ech has two seats inthe Knesset, as Israel's parliament is called.   Moledet also demands the expulsion to Arab countries of the 1.5million Palestinians living in the territories. Party leader RehavamZeevi, a retired general, calls the policy ``transfer.''   ``Shamir clarified that the idea of transfer will not be includedin the guidelines of the next government,'' said Yossi Ahimeir, theprime minister's aide. ``The concept is rejected by the Likud.''   Zeevi said he would join a Likud government even withoutacceptance of his platform.   Ahimeir said Shamir also told Tzomet and the right-wing partyTehiya that annexing the West Bank and Gaze would violate the 1978Camp David accords that led to the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt. Theaccords call for negotiations on Palestinian autonomy and the finalstatus of the occupied lands.   Shamir agreed, however, that a government led by Likud wouldincrease Jewish settlement in the occupied territories dramatically,Ahimeir said, and ``the only restraint will be economicconsiderations.''   The Jerusalem Post quoted Tehiya sources as saying a settlementboom would crush any peace moves based on Palestinian autonomy,making formal renunciation of the Camp David accords unnecessary.   Gush Emunim, a settlement movement, said Thursday it plans 50 newsettlements in the next three years and may start building 11 thismonth. About 70,000 Jews now live in 131 settlements in the WestBank and Gaza.   Israeli media speculated about Cabinet posts in a Likud coalitionand generally agreed that Moshe Arens, a hard-liner allied withShamir, was the leading candidate for defense minister.   Ariel Sharon, a former defense minister, wants the job again butspeculation was that he would become police minister and strengthenborder police units in the occupied territories. During thecampaign, Sharon said security forces should form special squads to``eliminate terrorists and rioters.''   Shamir said he has neither chosen ministers nor approachedcandidates.</TEXT></DOC>
