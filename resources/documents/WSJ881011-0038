About the size of a thumbnail, a single semiconductor of this type today fetches as much as $60 on world markets; an equal weight of gold costs about $20.    For Siemens, the tiny chip is weighty in more than price. It represents the first step in a $1 billion drive to get back into the semiconductor race, where Siemens had fallen woefully behind. The four-year-old effort, dubbed the Mega project, is considered crucial if the electronics giant is to stay competitive in everything from computers and process controls to X-ray machines and telephone switches.    Accordingly, Siemens has turned its approach to the semiconductor business upside down. The plant here is producing state-of-the-art one-megabit dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAMs, capable of storing a million bits of information. To come up with the manufacturing process for them, Siemens did the unthinkable: It bought technology from Japan's Toshiba Corp. In addition, Siemens is collaborating with rival N.V. Philips to develop the next generation, four-megabit chips.    That should put Siemens on a competitive footing with the Japanese -- leaders in the chip world. Now Siemens, which never much cared about making chips for anybody but itself, is going after market share. Its semiconductor business was split off from a components group a week ago and became a separate division with full business autonomy. The new division's goal: to double semiconductor sales in three years. The goal in the U.S., where Siemens is expanding its presence, is even more ambitious: to more than double sales, currently $200 million a year, in the next two years.    Siemens still has an uphill battle. It ranked 16th in the world last year among chip makers, with $657 million in sales, according to Dataquest Inc. Of that total, only $4 million came from Japanese customers, who buy 40% of the world's semiconductors. Moreover, its commercial production of one-megabit DRAMs only began last fall, some two years behind the Japanese. Even with current output of a million units a month, its production represents a mere 6% of world supply.    Nonetheless, Siemens clearly has come a long way in four years. In 1984, the methodical, Munich-based concern was so far behind the Japanese that some people thought Siemens might quit the business altogether. &quot;They were a nonentity,&quot; says Malcolm Penn, who follows semiconductors for Dataquest in London. &quot;They still have a lot of catching up to do, but now at least they're back in the race.&quot;    Management rejected the idea of dropping out and simply buying the chips that it needed, fearing that doing so would cost the company control over the basic building blocks of almost every product it makes. &quot;We need the technology in-house in order to have the most advanced chips in our systems,&quot; says Karlheinz Kaske, Siemens chairman.    So, in a decision that was roundly criticized at home in Bavaria, Siemens in 1985 turned to Toshiba for help. It paid an undisclosed amount for the one-megabit DRAMs process technology. Now, the decision looks like a &quot;brilliant&quot; move, Mr. Penn says, because Toshiba's proved to be the best technology. The Siemens plant boasts production yields that are as much as twice those of other Japanese chip makers besides Toshiba. Moreover, the experience has permitted Siemens to greatly enhance its efforts on the four-megabit chip, due out late next year, about the same time as Japanese versions.    The race to crowd the most bits of information on a chip is a realm where science seemingly borders on science fiction. Circuit lines on the one-megabit chip, for instance, are one micron wide -- about 1% of the width of a human hair. The smaller the circuit lines, the more bits of information that can be crowded on the chip. Such microscopic etching on silicon wafers requires the highest production standards.    The Regensburg plant -- one of only three factories outside Japan that makes one-megabit DRAMs -- bears little resemblance to a typical Siemens factory. The plant, situated amid the rolling Bavarian countryside, lies on a specially constructed foundation to minimize vibration in the fabricating rooms. Inside, workers wearing hoods and white suits function in an atmosphere 1,000 times cleaner than a hospital operating room. The air they breathe in special &quot;clean rooms&quot; is evacuated, filtered and recirculated every few seconds so dust and other particles are flushed through holes in the floor.    &quot;It's an absolutely sterile environment,&quot; says plant manager Wolfgang Ganser as he peers through a window shielding one clean room.    With the first step of the Mega project completed, Siemens is aggressively focusing on selling more chips to outside users -- something that wasn't considered necessary when its first priority was to service in-house needs. The project's $1 billion price tag changed that thinking.    &quot;We don't have any choice. We have to live and compete in the external market,&quot; says Juergen Knorr, president of the new chip unit. A sign on his office door conveys the new message: &quot;Cancel all appointments that are not absolutely essential for the promotion of our business.&quot;    Newly created departments direct the marketing effort in specific industry segments, including telecommunications, entertainment, automotive, data processing and industrial controls. In the U.S. market, Siemens is concentrating on the same fields to keep pace with its ambitious corporate plan to more than double U.S. sales in the next two years.    The company now has 70 sales representatives in the U.S., up from 20 a few years ago. It also has stepped up its representation through dealers and distributors. To better serve the technical needs of its U.S. customers, it plans to expand its semiconductor design center in Santa Clara, Calif.    &quot;The U.S. market is critical to us if we are to become a truly global supplier,&quot; says Helmut Schwab, president of the U.S. chip unit.    Mr. Knorr says Siemens also is considering buying rival chip firms to shore up its low penetration of both the U.S. and Japanese markets. In another change bordering on heresy at engineering-minded Siemens, the product development and research groups now report to marketing.    Of course, in the present market there isn't much need for marketing. The near empty closet at the plant that's used to store DRAMs inventory attests to the current market shortage. That's been a blessing for Siemens. Even though it was two years late to market, it is selling the new chips as fast as it can make them -- at prices more than twice what it expected. But at some point the market will cool, so Siemens figures it had better start selling to tomorrow's customers today.    &quot;They're really aggressively pushing new concepts now. It's like a different company,&quot; says Haekke Koskenen, a senior vice president at Oy Nokia, a Finnish electronics concern. In the past, Siemens was content to supply less than 2% of Nokia's chip supplies, Mr. Koskenen says. Now Siemens wants more.    ---                Siemens's Semiconductor Sales                (In millions of U.S. dollars)          WORLD-WIDE              WORLD MARKET YEAR       SALES      RANKING*       SHARE      U.S. SHARE 1987        $657         16          1.8%          1.2% 1986         502         17          1.7           0.8 1985         420         15          1.7           1.0 1984         450         16          1.6           0.9 1983         333         15          1.7           N.A   *Among all producers world-wide, based on global sales   N.A.=Not available   Source: Dataquest Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
