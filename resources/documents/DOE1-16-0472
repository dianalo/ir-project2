Thesamples have been counted for total beta activity, and a range of gammaand alpha emitters have been determined. The mean levels over the studyperiod are, in general, of the same order as found by MAFF in 1984 inCumbrian coastal waters and thus the dose from these nuclides on eatingthis seafood would be expected to be similar to 1984, within the ICRPprincipal dose limit of 1 mSv year{sup -1}, assuming similar consumptionrates. Most of the radiation dose to the critical group within the Cumbriancommunity comes through winkle consumption.</TEXT></DOC>
