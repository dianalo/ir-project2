A local radio station said a 63-year-old male resident of theMindoro town of San Jose, apparently the hardest-hit area, suffereda heart attack and died moments after the 4:21 a.m. earthquake.   Seismologists in Manila, 160 miles north of the affected area,said the tremor measured 5.4 on the Richter scale and was followedby repeated aftershocks.   Initial radio reports said the earthquake caused somefatalities. But San Jose's private radio station, DZYM, and thePhilippine National Red Cross said later the only confirmedcasualties were a woman and three children who were injured when awall collapsed.   The wife of a DZYM station technician and the couple's threechildren were pinned by a bedroom wall that fell on them, DZYMannouncer Nathan Cruz told The Associated Press in aradio-telephone interview. All four were taken to a hospital.   Cruz said the earthquake caused a fissure on the town'soutskirts near the coast and that the sea level rose by at leastfive feet shortly after the temblor. The water quickly receded, hesaid.   Remedios Eraham, head of the Red Cross chapter in San Jose, saidshe and other relief officers surveyed damage to the town beforeflying to Manila on unrelated business.   ``This was the first time people there can remember ever feelingan earthquake, and they are really scared,'' Mrs. Eraham said.   She said no building collapsed in San Jose although manyconcrete walls were badly cracked.   Mrs. Eraham said she had received no report of damage orcasualties in other Mindoro towns.   ``I would presume there are no other serious injuries, otherwisemy staff would have already reported it by radio,'' she said. Thereare no telephone connections from Manila to the island.   Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute ofVolcanology and Seismology, said the center of the earthquake wasabout 12 miles beneath the sea at a point some 37 miles southwestof San Jose. He said the tremor registered 5.4 on the Richter scale.   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by anearthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on aseismograph. Every increase of one number means that the groundmotion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 5 can causeconsiderable damage in populated areas.</TEXT></DOC>
