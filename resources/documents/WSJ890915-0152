As of July 1, 1988, males accounted for 48.7% of the U.S. population. But 52.9% of the residents of Alaska were male, a higher proportion than any other state. Census analysts suggest this largely reflects the migration of young men to work in Alaska.    Alaska also happens to be the only state where the median age of men -- 29.1 years -- is higher than the median age of women -- 28.1 years. The median age of the U.S. population as a whole is 32.3 years, meaning half the people are older and half are younger.    Women outnumber men by the widest margin in the District of Columbia. Only 46.7% of the residents of the nation's capital are male. New York is next with 47.6% males.    Boy newborns outnumber girls by a slight margin, but a substantially larger share of male infants die before their first birthday. Up to age 34, males still outnumber females in every age group. In older age groups, however, women predominate because men tend to die younger. </TEXT></DOC>
