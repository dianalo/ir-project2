The warning came on the second day of a weeklong officialanniversary to honor the victims of the Nazi Holocaust during WorldWar II. It is the largest such event ever organized in Poland.   On Friday, meanwhile, a Polish scholar told a scientificconference that she is ashamed of anti-Semitic behavior in Polandin 1968 and asked why more Polish officials, including someconference organizers, have not come forward to acceptresponsibility.   About 4,500 people from around the world, including 2,000 fromIsrael including Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon, havecome to Poland for the Ghetto Uprising Anniversary, honoring thefighters who resisted the final Nazi onslaught against the ghettofor three weeks in April and May of 1943.   In addition to the official observances, a group of 46intellectuals and opposition activists has called for an unofficialceremony Sunday in front of the Warsaw Ghetto Fighters' Monumentand in the old Jewish Cemetery.   The group is led by Marek Edelman, a longtime oppositionactivist who is the last surviving commander of the uprisingremaining in Poland. Edelman says he is boycotting the officialobservances because he considers them a cynical attempt by thegovernment to win favor in the West.   Jacek Kuron, an organizer of the unsanctioned ceremony and anadviser to the outlawed trade union Solidarity, said he was takento a Warsaw prosecutor's office for the warning talk byplainclothed police.   ``I was told that the event which I am co-organizing on Sunday ... is illegal ... so the authorities cannot assure protection andthe (organizing) committee will be morally and legally responsiblefor any possible provocations which might take place,'' Kuron said.   Kuron said the committee intends to proceed with the observancesanyway, including a wreath-laying ceremony at the Ghetto Fighters'Monument and the dedication of a memorial in the Jewish Cemetery totwo Polish-Jewish socialists executed by the Soviet Union duringWorld War II.   The alternative observances have come under heavy attack in theofficial media, which has charged the organizers with beinganti-Soviet ``hyenas'' trying to take advantage of the anniversaryto call attention to themselves.   Meanwhile, on the second day of a two-day historical andscientific conference on the struggle of Jews and Poles under theNazi occupation, Irena Maciejewska drew applause at the conferencewhen she referred to the politically inspired anti-Semitic purgethat took place in Poland in 1968.   Mrs. Maciejewska, who was delivering a paper on the WarsawGhetto Uprising in literature, said that when she cooperates withone official institution co-sponsoring the conference, the JewishHistorical Institute, she finds herself ``in the company of peoplewho injured the good name of Poland in 1968.''   To applause from the audience of several hundred people, sheadded: ``As a university person I painfully remember that time andas a Pole I should be ashamed of it.''   The Polish United Workers (Communist) Party, in a newspaperarticle last month, said anti-Semitism played a role in 1968 inpolitical purges that caused thousands of Jews to lose jobs ingovernment, journalism, the army and academia.   Opposition activists criticized the statement as being too mildand for not identifying individuals involved, some of whom theycharged still hold prominent positions in Poland.</TEXT></DOC>
