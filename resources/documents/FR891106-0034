This action is necessarybecause some beneficiaries receive income, or pay expenses affecting theirentitlement, in foreign currencies. The intended effect of this amendmentis to establish a regulatory method for calculating the rates or amountsdue those beneficiaries.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received on or before December 6, 1989.Comments will be available for public inspection until December 18, 1989.This change is proposed to be effective 30 days after the date of publicationof the final rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Interested persons are invited to submit written comments,suggestions, or objections regarding this change to the Secretary of VeteransAffairs (271A), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW.,Washington, DC 20420. All written comments received will be available forpublic inspection only in the Veterans Service Unit, room 132, at the aboveaddress and only between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday throughFriday (except holidays) until December 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Donald England, Consultant, RegulationsStaff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration(202) 233-3005.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Under the income-based programs administeredby VA, benefit amounts are determined according to formulas which allowadjustments to countable income based on medical expenses paid by the claimant.The amounts payable for burial, plot and headstone allowances, or for claimsfiled by someone other than a surviving spouse or dependent child for accruedbenefits due a deceased beneficiary, are determined from the amount ofexpenses borne by the claimant. Entitlement to these benefits is calculatedassuming that all financial transactions are in U.S. dollars, but somebeneficiaries living outside of the United States receive income, or payexpenses, in the currency of the country in which they reside. We are proposinga method for converting income received or expenses paid in a foreign currencyinto U.S. dollar equivalents for the purpose of determining entitlementto VA benefits.We propose to perform these calculations using quarterly exchange ratesestablished by the Department of the Treasury. The quarterly Treasury ratesare averages of daily rates obtained from State Department disbursing officers,and the rates are available to the public. We propose to implement thisprocedure by adding new andSection; 3.32 to Title 38, Code of Federal Regulations.In claims for burial, plot and headstone allowances and claims for accruedbenefits as reimbursement from the person who bore the expenses of a deceasedbeneficiary's last illness or burial, we propose to use the rate for thequarter in which the expenses were paid or, if the claim is filed by anunpaid creditor, for the quarter in which the veteran died. In any claimwhere entitlement originated during a quarter for which an exchange ratehas not yet been published, the most recent quarterly rate would be used.Since exchange rates fluctuate and cannot be predicted in advance, themost recent quarterly exchange rate would also be used to project paymentrates in improved pension or parents' dependency and indemnity compensation(DIC) claims. Retroactive adjustments required by fluctuations in exchangerates would be performed annualy when the Eligibility Verification Report(EVR) is submitted and would be calculated using the exchange rate obtainedby averaging the four most recent quarterly rates. Unusual medical expensesmay be reported up to one year after the close of an EVR period, and adjustmentsto prior EVR periods would be calculated using the average of the fourquarterly rates which were the most recent available as of the closingdate of the twelve-month EVR period in question.This method was chosen because it minimizes the administrative burdensas well as the complexity of the mathematical computations involved. Althoughother methods, such as one using daily bank rates, were considered, theyare not being proposed because they would impose unreasonable administrativeburdens while offering little or no additional benefit to claimants.The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 5 U.S.C. 601-612.The reason for this certification is that this amendment would not directlyaffect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected.Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from theinitial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections603 and 604.In accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, the Secretaryhas determined that this regulatory amendment is non-major for the followingreasons:(1) It will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore.(2) It will not cause a major increase in costs or prices.(3) It will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employmentinvestment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.101,64.104, 64.105 and 64.110.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 3</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Handicapped, Health care,Pension, Veterans.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: October 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.
