YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/31/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BT CMB SOCIBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Comptroller of the Currency gave three more banks preliminary approval to operate in the District of Columbia, even though no one is certain just what they will be allowed to do.    Meanwhile, the Comptroller asked a federal court in Florida to lift a 23-month order barring the agency from issuing charters for new limited-service banks, the so-called non-bank banks that either accept deposits or grant commercial loans, but don't do both.    The new District of Columbia operations of Bankers Trust Co. and Chase Manhattan Bank, both of New York, and Society Corp., Cleveland, were approved yesterday through a now-changed provision of the local laws governing banking in the nation's capital.    Similar applications by J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. of New York and two private investors were approved by the Comptroller last week.    Since 1901 District of Columbia law had allowed companies wishing to operate a bank in Washington either to obtain a national charter from the Comptroller or apply to the District of Columbia's Corporation Counsel for a license &quot;to engage in the business of a bank of deposit.&quot;    Washington's City Council changed the law earlier this year, establishing a District of Columbia Superintendent of Banking and Financial Institutions. The superintendent will operate as a state bank commissioner and issue the equivalent of state bank charters.    But before the new law could take effect, 11 banks and individual investors applied to the District of Columbia Corporation Counsel for the banking licenses.    In approving the applications, the Comptroller ordered the new operations to &quot;comply with any and all regulations issued by the District of Columbia Superintendent of Banking and Financial Institutions.&quot;    The only problems are that there is no permanent superintendent and there are no regulations. &quot;Until our regulations are in place, I can't give definitive answers as to what (the banks') powers will be,&quot; said Edward Irons, acting District of Columbia superintendent of banking.    One of the Comptroller's conditions in granting the preliminary approval, though, is that the banks obtain deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. By doing that, the banks would put themselves under the Glass-Steagall Act's prohibition on underwriting or dealing in securities, according to attorneys in the Comptroller's office.    Officials of the Comptroller's office also said it wasn't clear what further regulatory approval was necessary for the new banks. The Federal Reserve Board, for instance, could claim authority over the bank holding companies.    Five other applications are still pending, including one from New York's Chemical Bank.    In the 85 years the law was in effect, only one institution, Industrial Bank of Washington, was established using its provisions. Industrial Bank has been operating since 1934 and has offered only traditional banking services.    The Comptroller's motion, filed Christmas Eve in U.S. District Court in Jacksonville, Fla., asked the court to vacate its earlier injunction in light of a federal appeals court ruling in October. That decision allowed U.S. Trust Corp., a bank holding company, to expand its limited-service banking activities across state lines by buying a limited-service bank in Florida.    Since limited-service banks don't fit the legal definition of full-service banks, they are exempt from a number of prohibitions, such as interstate branching, that apply to the traditional institutions,    Many in Congress, notably designated Senate BankingCommittee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.), want to curbthe spread of limited-service banks, lest they gobble up thesmall local banks across the country. Mr. Proxmire has saidthat legislation to do that will be a priority when the 100thCongress convenes next month.</TEXT></DOC>
