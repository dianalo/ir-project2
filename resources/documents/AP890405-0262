(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chevron Corp. expects to beginproduction near Point Arguello later this year as part of a projectdesigned to supply enough energy to fuel 2.9 million cars a day,according to a company attorney.   Chevron lawyer Doug Uchikura made the statement Tuesday nightwhen the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors voted that agroup of companies led by Chevron be allowed to start oil andnatural gas operations. The board voted 4 to 1 that the $2 billionproject meets county safety requirements.   Uchikura said the company still needs board approval for usingtankers to move oil from Point Arguello to California refineries,including Chevron's huge facility at Richmond. He said that onceapproval for the tankers is received the company plans to startoperations in July or August.   The other companies in the partnership include Texaco Inc.,Phillips Petroleum Co., Pennzoil Co., Sun Co. and Union PacificCorp.   The plan calls for three offshore drilling platforms and two27-mile pipelines that transport crude oil and gas to separatepurifying plants in Gaviota.   Chevron agreed to install an alarm system on the pipeline thatwould detect a hydrogen sulfide leak. The county planningcommission earlier rejected th plan, saying the companiesunderestimated by 65 percent the amount of hydrogen sulfide in thefield's natural gas.   Chevron also agreed to lower pipeline pressure to reduce thespread of a potential leak in an area that was hit by a 3 milliongallon oil spill by Union Oil Co. in 1969.   Backers say that by the 1990s the field's production could hit93,000 barrels of oil and 60 million cubic feet of gas a day, morethan the current output for the entire Santa Barbara Channel.</TEXT></DOC>
