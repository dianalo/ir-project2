President Bush is expected to sign the measure into law soon. Last week, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter informed lawmakers that the White House would accept a package costing less than $900 million.    The legislation, which cleared the House without dissent and the Senate by voice vote, is almost identical to a measure approved Wednesday by the Senate, and then embraced by House conferees in negotiations that stretched into the early morning hours Friday.    The compromise slashed about $450 million from the $1.3 billion bill passed in late June by the House. Most of the savings were gained by tightening up the eligibility standards for relief and by setting a single payment rate. The measure will compensate eligible farmers at a rate equal to 65% of anticipated income.    The main beneficiaries will be farmers in parched parts of the Great Plains and western Corn Belt, where last year's devastating drought still lingers, and in parts of the South, where floods have wiped out rice and cotton crops. Individual farmers will be able to collect as much as $100,000. The measure also provides assistance to livestock producers who face drought-related feed and water shortages.    &quot;This measure, in a small way, will help rural America better cope with the effects of adverse weather,&quot; said House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza (D., Texas). Added his Senate counterpart, Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.): &quot;We have administration support and a commitment that the relief will be on its way to farmers before the fall planting season.&quot; Under the compromise package, participants in the government's farm-subsidy program who raise corn, wheat, cotton and other so-called program crops must suffer a 40% crop loss to qualify for relief.    The eligibility standard for tobacco, peanuts and sugar producers also will be a 40% crop loss. It will be 45% for soybean and sunflower growers, and 50% for producers of fruits, vegetables and other nonprogram crops.    Lawmakers renewed their efforts to promote federal crop insurance as an alternative to ad hoc disaster relief in the future. They rewarded farmers who bought federal crop insurance for program crops this year by setting the eligibility level at 35%. At the same time, they required recipients of disaster relief, with a few exceptions, to buy federal crop insurance for their 1990 crops.    Although this package is far less costly than last year's $4 billion bailout, it should strengthen the hand of those advocating a sweeping overhaul of the crop insurance program, which has been beset by heavy losses, underwriting errors and other problems.    The difficulty of enacting disaster relief amid budget constraints, said Rep. Edward Madigan (R., Ill.), &quot;highlights the need to pursue federal crop insurance reforms.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
