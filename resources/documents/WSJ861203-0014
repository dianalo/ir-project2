Boesky insider-trading scandal, called off its planned move to a new headquarters.    The decision to abandon its move comes in the wake of announcements that the firm is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a federal grand jury in connection with the Boesky case. Since then Drexel has been conspicuously absent from the continuing rush of takeovers as companies hurry to complete transactions by the end of the year to take advantage of current tax laws.    Robert E. Linton, Drexel's chairman, said yesterday that Drexel had decided Monday it wouldn't be occupying the downtown Manhattan building called Seven World Trade Center.    &quot;This in no way reflects any lesser expansion plans,&quot; Mr. Linton said. But &quot;with all the fallout&quot; from the insider-trading investigation still under way, it is &quot;not a propitious time to go through with all the tremendous diversion&quot; of creating a new headquarters building for Drexel.    As previously reported, Drexel agreed to lease the entire 47-story office building last June. The agreement followed several months of negotiations with the building's developer, Larry Silverstein of New York.    Under the terms of that agreement, Drexel would have leased the 1.9 million square foot building for 30 years. In return, it would have received a 49.9% equity stake in the project.    But for several months, even before the insider-trading scandal involving Mr. Boesky came to light, the agreement appeared to be on shaky ground. There were frequent rumors that the two sides couldn't resolve differences caused by tax-law changes, and at one point in September, Mr. Silverstein put out feelers to see if he could find other tenants in case Drexel changed its mind.    The tax-law changes that helped kill the headquarters agreement, Mr. Linton said, involved provisions that would end all tax advantages from installment sales, and which would limit the ability of owners to use depreciation benefits to offset interest payments.    Mr. Linton said that instead of moving, Drexel signed a lease Monday night for an additional 150,000 square feet of space in its current headquarters, also in downtown Manhattan. Drexel's lease in the building expires in 1993.    Last week, after a Nov. 24 deadline for the signing of a lease agreement passed, both Drexel and Mr. Silverstein denied that the agreement had collapsed.    Mr. Silverstein said he first learned that the agreement had collapsed when Frederick H. Joseph, Drexel's chief executive officer, visited his home Monday night. &quot;I was really surprised,&quot; Mr. Silverstein said. &quot;When I talked to them last week, they said everything was fine. But the tax issues had caused tremendous problems, and when you add to that the insider-trading scandal, you have a . . . mess.&quot;    The collapse of the headquarters agreement is likely to spur growing speculation on Wall Street that the fallout from the insider-trading scandal will seriously curb Drexel's rapid growth. At an economics briefing for the press yesterday, for example, Mr. Joseph was besieged with questions about possible Drexel links to the Boesky case, and about the impact of the insider-trading probes on the firm's business.    Mr. Joseph, citing advice from the firm's attorneys, declined to disclose which Drexel employees had received subpoenas or to discuss any other details of the government investigations.    But he described himself as &quot;shellshocked&quot; by revelations of the ties between Mr. Boesky and former Drexel managing director Dennis B. Levine. Asked if he was confident that no Drexel employees would have to resign because of the investigations, he answered: &quot;No. What I think I am confident of is we don't know of anything any of our people have done wrong.&quot;    Mr. Joseph also said that Drexel officials have had &quot;some preliminary discussions&quot; about bringing in an independent outside counsel to investigate Drexel's role in the Boesky case, but haven't decided to do so. &quot;We don't really know enough to know if that is an appropriate aid,&quot; he said. E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. brought in an outside counsel to investigate its check-kiting scandal.    The Boesky scandal hadn't led to any change in the way Drexel oversees its lucrative junk-bond operation in Beverly Hills, Calif., Mr. Joseph said. The operation is headed by Michael Milken, who has been subpoened by the SEC. &quot;I don't really anticipate any meaningful change&quot; in Drexel's commanding share of the high-yield, high-risk bond market, he added.    Mr. Joseph said that Drexel was having a very successful year, with the firm's capital growing to nearly $1.8 billion, which he said makes Drexel the most highly capitalized privately held securities firm on Wall Street.    Meanwhile, Drexel's decision to abandon its headquarters plan means that Mr. Silverstein must now find a tenant or tenants to replace Drexel for the building he expects to complete in mid-1987. Mr. Silverstein said that the building's large size and relatively low cost would make that search easy. &quot;We've had a number of calls from major entities interested in the space,&quot; he said.    But many New York real estate industry brokers and developers said Mr. Silverstein would find the going tough. The downtown office market has softened in recent months, its vacancy rate climbing to about 11%.    Moreover, there is plenty of competing space available. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. is subleasing 1.2-million square feet of space in a nearby office tower, and Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. is understood to be moving from a downtown office building to another one in mid-Manhattan.    Besides his carrying costs, Mr. Silverstein must also worry about the estimated $40 million worth of loans that real estate industry sources say he personally guaranteed. &quot;This wasn't one of Larry's better days,&quot; one broker who knows the developer said. </TEXT></DOC>
