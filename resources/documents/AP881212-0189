Col. William R.Higgins said Monday they have decided to ``execute'' the U.S. Marineas a spy for Israel.   ``We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute thisAmerican spy,'' said a typewritten Arabic statement signed by theOrganization of the Oppressed on Earth and delivered to theindependent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar.   A photocopy of a picture purporting to show Higgins, the mostrecent kidnap victim of nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon, wasplastered at the bottom of the 15-line statement. Hostage holders inLebanon usually insert a picture with a statement to prove itsauthenticity.   In its statement, the group said the decision to kill Higgins wasa retaliation for Israeli attacks against ``our people in occupiedPalestine'' _ the West Bank and Gaza Strip _ and predominantlyShiite south Lebanon.   It also said Higgins would die in ``revenge for the blood of themartyrs of the latest Israeli raid'' on a Palestinian guerrilla basenine miles south of Beirut. Nine guerrillas were killed Friday inthe Israeli attack. An Israeli officer also died.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman saidhe had no details of the threat beyond press reports.   ``These hostages are all innocent victims,'' Redman said. ``Theyshould all be released immediately. Col. Higgins was there on amission of peace as a member of an international peacekeepingoperation. He, like the others, is an innocent victim.''   Nancy Beck, a department spokeswoman, said later: ``The notionthat kidnappers have the right to try their victims is grotesque.... The so-called trial and outcome represent a cyncial attempt toexploit the holding of hostages, particularly during the Christmasseason.''   Her statement added: ``The charge that Col. Higgins is a spy isnonsense.''   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was head of a 76-man observergroup attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon whenhe was kidnapped near Tyre on Feb. 17.   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, believed made up ofShiite Moslems loyal to Iran, previously charged that Higgins usedhis U.N. uniform as a cover for espionage. United Nations and U.S.officials denied the charge.   The new picture resembled a photograph released by the kidnappersApril 21. That photo showed the balding Higgins stoop-shoulderedwith his eyes cast down. He had gray stubble on his cheeks and waswearing a dark field jacket.   The statement accompanying the earlier picture said the group hadput Higgins on trial before ``a tribunal of the oppressed'' onspying charges.   In Monday's statement, the group said, ``It has been proven byclearcut evidence that (Higgins) and his American team of observersare guilty of providing the Zionist enemy with accurate and detailedmilitary and security information about our resistance fighters,their positions, movements, supply routes and the quantity andquality of their weaponry.''   ``The spy has been turned over to those responsible for executingthis just and revolutionary verdict,'' the statement said. Nospecific execution date was mentioned.   There have been three other communications from the group sinceHiggins' abduction _ two statements listing demands for his releaseand a videotape in which Higgins repeated the demands.   The demands focused on the release of Palestinian and Lebaneseprisoners held by Israel and its proxy militia, the South LebanonArmy. Israel rejected the demands.   Fifteen foreigners are missing and presumed kidnapped in Lebanon.They are nine Americans, three Britons, one Irishman, one Italianand a Swiss. The longest held is American Terry Anderson, 40, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   Higgins' sister, Mary Fisher of Louisville, Ky., said she heardof the kidnappers' statement only from news reports.   Higgins, a decorated Vietnam veteran, is married to Marine Maj.Robin Higgins and has a 17-year-old daughter.   He graduated from high school in Louisville and from MiamiUniversity of Ohio on ROTC scholarship in 1967. He earned master'sdegrees in human resources management at Pepperdine Univiversity inCalifornia and in political science at Auburn in Alabama.</TEXT></DOC>
