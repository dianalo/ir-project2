Peggy Say, who has unflinchingly worked for freedom for herbrother Terry Anderson, said Reagan administration officialsindicated recently that no progress has been made to win hisrelease.   ``I will not stand by and watch somebody else come out while mybrother stays behind,'' Mrs. Say said in an interview broadcastSunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, was abducted March 16, 1985. He is among nine Americansbeing held hostage in Lebanon, including recent abductee Marine Lt.Col. William R. Higgins, who was kidnapped Wednesday.   Mrs. Say charged that a double standard exists in which U.S.officials actively tried to locate Higgins, but have not been asvigorous in trying to find her brother.   She added that the double standard is not new, and she citedU.S. efforts to free Americans held hostage in the hijacking of aTWA jetliner and the cruise ship Achille Lauro and the negotiationsto win the release of journalist Nicholas Daniloff, who wasarrested by the Soviets.   She said that during a State Department meeting several monthsago, she was told that ``their policy was absolute non-negotiationsfor Terry and the others.''   ``I reminded them that they had told me that before TWA and Iwatched those negotiations,'' she said. ``And then they got back tome and said, now we're back to our old policy, no negotiations. Iwatched Achille Lauro and I watched Nick Daniloff.   ``And I said to them a couple of months ago, I do not intend tostand by again and watch you break that public policy when it ispolitically expedient for you to do so.''   President Reagan said Thursday he wants ``to rescue'' Higgins,who headed the 75-man observer group attached to the United NationsInterim Force in Lebanon, but officials played down the idea of amilitary mission to gain the officer's release.</TEXT></DOC>
