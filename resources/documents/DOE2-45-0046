<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-45-0046 </DOCNO><TEXT>In March, 1988, Japan had nine geothermal power plants totaling 215 MW,ranking fifth in the world in terms of total power capacity. Long-termprospects for energy demand and supply show geothermal power supply willreach 2 million kiloliters(crude oil conversion) in fiscal 1995 and 4.4million kiloliters in fiscal 2000. Although these figures are lower thanthose in the preceding plan, they mark a great increase from 0.4 millionkiloliters in fiscal 1986. The amount of geothermal power available inJapan is about 30 GW(crude oil conversion:60 Glannually)even when limitedto that available in a shallow portion to a depth of about 2,000 m belowground level. The projected power capacity is 740 MW in 1996 includingthe projected Hacchobaru Power Plant No.2 of Kyushu Electric Power Co.,Ltd. and Kakkonda Power Plant No.2 of Tohoku Geothermal Energy Co., Ltd.By 1996,500 to 600 MW must be additionally obtained.
