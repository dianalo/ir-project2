The simulated maps are compared with observationsand it is found that the MHD model reproduces the qualitative featuresof observed disturbances. The disturbance produced by the MHD simulationis found to correspond in strength with the weakest disturbance whichcan be reliably detected by existing single station IPS observations.</TEXT></DOC>
