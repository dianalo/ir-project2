Few periods in history have presented such clear choices betweenpromise and peril, and experts predict that civilization in the21st century and beyond may well be shaped by global decisions madein the 1990s.   ``Human beings now have the power to control their own fate to adegree that they've never had before,'' said Edward Cornish,president of the World Future Society.   ``Unfortunately, we do not know how to handle this power verywell. We don't have very well developed systems for managing theworld as a whole.''   The World Future Society, an organization that monitors trendsand forecasts their effects, annually surveys the views ofspecialists on the major problems in years ahead.   Topping the list of challenges for the 1990s: environmentaldamage to the Earth's climate, land, water and atmosphere.   ``In 1986, the cluster of environmental problems was No. 3 onthis list of fears,'' said Michael Marien, editor of the survey.Now, he said, ``it has clearly become the leading problem area.''   World Watch, an environmental research organization, agrees withthe assessment. In its annual ``State of the World,'' theorganization calls the 1990s ``the turnaround decade,'' and warns,``By many measures, time is running out.''   Global warming, because it affects all else, is of the mostconcern to futurists and to many environmentalists.   Scientists agree that human action, principally burning fossilfuels and the slash-and-burn clearing of vast forest lands, isincreasing the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In what is calledthe ``greenhouse effect,'' carbon dioxide and some other gases actlike a global thermal blanket, allowing sunlight to strike Earth,but trapping heat that otherwise would radiate back into space.   Eventually, the theory goes, the planet will warm, polar icewill melt, climates will change, oceans will rise, agriculturalpatterns will be disrupted and food supplies will decline.   Scientists disagree about whether the greenhouse effect isalready causing the Earth to overheat. But it is accepted that onlya determined effort to reduce fossil fuel use and halt destructionof forests will reverse rising levels of carbon dioxide in theatmosphere.   Human actions also are thought to be causing the depletion inthe stratosphere of the ozone layer that shields againstultraviolet solar radiation. Chlorofluorocarbons, a widely usedchemical family, becomes a pollutant in the atmosphere, destroyingozone molecules and weakening the UV shield. This can lead to moreskin cancer, weaker plants and poorer harvests.   Industry and governments already have recognized this problemand have signed agreements to eventually stop use ofchlorofluorocarbons, but atoms of this chemical can survive for 50years, assuring that ozone depletion will be a problem well beyondthe 1990s.   Governments also are taking action against other environmentalproblems _ acid rain, water pollution, garbage disposal and theextinction of species. How well these measures succeed is, again,an issue of the 1990s that will depend on human will.   Worldwide economic turbulence is second on the list of impendingworries, according to the World Future Society survey.   The growing chasm between rich and poor, between debt-ridden,overpopulated Third World nations and the vigorous economies ofdeveloped nations may sharply intensify in the new decade.   But for America, experts see the `90s as an era of prosperity.   ``The 1990s will be a decade of solid economic growth ... andthe U.S. will continue to be the most influential nation intechnology, trade and political leadership,'' predict economistsAustin H. Kiplinger and Knight A. Kiplinger in their book ``Americain the Global '90s.''   The trick, said Cornish, will be in finding ways to allow thepoorer nations to share in the good times.   Nuclear war, long considered the greatest threat to the world'sfuture, is third on the list of future fears.   The specialists believe this concern has receded because of theCold War thaw, but they warn that the missiles, East and West, arestill poised, and the road to a sure and certain peace is not inplace.   Fourth on the World Future Society list of problems for the1990s: the epidemic of drug abuse in America, a concern not evenmentioned in earlier surveys by the society.   Cocaine and its insidious first cousin, crack, have turned manyurban neighborhoods into marketplaces for addiction, with murder anightly event, and crimes routinely committed to support drughabits. Marijuana is grown illegally in many parts of the UnitedStates, and heroin continues to hook the young.   President Bush has pledged a war to shut down the illegal trade,and other nations are battling powerful drug cartels. The resultsare still uncertain, and the effort is sure to extend into the1990s, and perhaps beyond.   The futurists rank the AIDS epidemic as the fifth-worst problemof the new decade, although some medical experts would put it atthe top.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
