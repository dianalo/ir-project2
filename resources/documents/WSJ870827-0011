The indictment charges Dovie Beams de Villagran, 55 years old, and her husband, Sergio Villagran, 51, with fraudulently obtaining $18 million in loans from financial institutions including Bank of America, Lloyds Bank, Security Pacific National Bank and Imperial Bank.    The indictment alleges that the Villagrans obtained loans by falsely inflating their financial worth and income from their business interests, including International Auto Brokers and Villagran Properties.    The indictment says International Auto Brokers &quot;purportedly&quot; exported and sold millions of dollars of customized, new American-made automobiles to Middle Eastern countries and that Villagran Properties &quot;purportedly&quot; had a positive cash flow from residential properties owned by the couple in Los Angeles.    The indictment charges that the couple applied for the loans between January 1983 and February 1986 and falsified federal tax returns and financial statements for 1983 through 1985 to obtain the loans.    The 42-count indictment includes two counts of bankruptcy fraud. One charges that the Villagrans concealed from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court numerous antique furnishings, original paintings and a Chinese ceramic collection, valued at more than $6 million in the couple's financial statements.    The couple couldn't be reached for comment.    The U.S. Attorney's office said the indictment follows a year-long investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.    If convicted, Dovie Beams de Villagran faces a maximum penalty of 141 years in prison and a $10.5 million fine. Sergio Villagran, who is charged in all but one of the counts, would face a maximum of 136 years in prison and a $10.3 million fine. </TEXT></DOC>
