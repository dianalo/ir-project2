The company, which Commerzbank AG took public late last year after acquiring it from U.S.-based Allied-Signal Inc., said group sales are likely to rise 10% this year to about 566 million marks ($310.7 million) from 515 million marks in 1987 and are expected to climb at a 10% annual rate in the following four years.    Chairman Wolfgang Kummer said in an interview that group earnings are expected to increase at an even faster pace this year, because Linotype is retaining its technological leadership in the fast-growing laser printing industry and is expanding into new markets.    In 1987, the company had net income of 41.5 million marks, posting a return on sales of 8%.    Five-month net income rose only 5% from a year earlier on 3% higher sales, but Mr. Kummer, citing a flurry of new products and a 44% jump in orders on hand as of May, said he expects business to pick up sharply in the second half.    Taking advantage of the success of desktop publishing, the world's second-largest maker of advanced laser image setters has begun to expand its product range and customer base, the chief executive said.    &quot;Our traditional area is the printing firm, and it will stay that way,&quot; he said. &quot;But our technology is also useful for groups that don't do print-for-profit. This is the large market of desktop publishing, and in this market we will increasingly enter.&quot;    While keeping laser image setters as its main and most profitable product, Linotype is beginning to sell complete work stations used for publishing and document processing work requiring high-quality printouts, Mr. Kummer said.    &quot;We will increasingly integrate mainstream products and become systems integrators,&quot; he said. &quot;And we will write the software (needed) to use the product in a special application field.&quot;    A growing focus on electronics and software has allowed the company to remain at the top of its field during its transformation from a U.S. to a West German company, Mr. Kummer said.    With this shift, the company moved in the opposite direction than its founder, Ottmar Mergenthaler, who emigrated from Germany to the U.S. where he built the first commercially usable typesetting machine in 1886.    The trend toward photographic typesetting and electronics in the 1970s prompted a shift of production facilities to West Germany, which was followed in 1983 by a transfer of Linotype's headquarters to Eschborn, a suburb of Frankfurt. Under Mr. Kummer's leadership, the company abandoned its production sites in the U.S. and Britain, and the public offering as a West German company completed its &quot;re-Germanization.&quot;    Despite the cutting of its U.S. ties, Linotype is still trying to expand its U.S. business, its largest single market, from the present 15%, Mr. Kummer said. &quot;It's our most important market, and there we have the most ambitious plans,&quot; he said.    But rather than going on an acquisition spree, Linotype will focus on growth from within, which is facilitated by its newly gained independence, he said.    Analysts said Linotype's shares are one of the few high-tech pearls on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. They said the shares have strong upside potential despite a rocky start when they were placed at 500.00 marks a share only a few days before the Oct. 19 stock market crash. With a total market value of 800 million marks, the placement of the 1.6 million issues was one of the largest initial offerings in West Germany.    The issue stayed at or below the issue price until early June, but has benefited from the recent stock market rally and has been trading at around 516.00 marks on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.    The issue is likely to outperform the market in the coming months, said Thomas Miskell, equity analyst at CRM Securities in London.    &quot;It is difficult to maintain such a return on sales for an extended period, but Linotype seems to have a lot of unique products,&quot; he said.    Mr. Miskell also cited Linotype's low debt-equity ratio and a likely increase in the 1988 dividend from 11.00 marks a share in 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
