The result may be sweetened offers for some of the most depressed stocks on the National Association of Securities Dealers automated quotation service, some investment bankers say.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors purchases a company in a transaction financed largely by debt. Ultimately, the group's borrowings are to be repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Investment bankers note that few of the LBOs offered to the public as new issues last year ever rose much in price, and many were among the issues hardest hit in the crash. A number of earlier issues were severely damaged, as well.    Moreover, in nearly every newly public LBO, the original owners and their investment partners still own a hefty position. That makes offers for the remaining shares relatively simple.    Take Days Inns Corp., which closed Friday in Nasdaq trading at $7.38 a share. Less than four years ago the motel chain was acquired in an LBO by interests of financier Saul Steinberg, chairman of Reliance Group Inc. He took it public in December 1985, and -- amid general investor enthusiasm for little OTC stocks the following spring -- the new issue more than doubled in price, and split.    Like many recent LBOs gone public, however, Days Inns had begun to wither even before the market crash, as investor interest in small issues began to wane. It plunged to $4.50 a share in the month following the big crash from $14.88 a share about a year ago.    Mr. Steinberg, who still owns nearly half of the stock through Reliance and an investment partnership it manages, proposed a plan last month to take Days Inn private once again. Earlier this month the Days Inn board accepted his sweetened offer of $7.75 a share in cash plus $2.25 a share in dividend-paying preferred shares.    For the moment, new public offerings of former LBOs have screeched to a standstill, according to Going Public: The IPO Reporter, a New York-based newsletter that tracks the new-issue market. &quot;Corporate finance officials generally agree that companies acquired in an LBO will now have to wait longer before going public,&quot; it said last week. These deals, the newsletter said, are more difficult for investment bankers to sell to investors than totally new companies even in the strongest new issue markets.    But at the same time, the newsletter said, &quot;Everybody who did an LBO and went public is considering a re-LBO because of the fall in stock prices.&quot;    Investment bankers say they believe the most likely targets for re-LBOs are the 1987 issues with strong earnings that tumbled in price in the crash before they could establish an investor following. &quot;There is a lot of good stuff out there, but investors are ignoring these companies,&quot; one broker says.    More than 2,000 new issues have entered Nasdaq trading since 1983. From the beginning of that boom for initial public offerings, or IPOs, many of the new issues have been companies or divisions of companies that previously went private as LBOs.    One of the first was Gibson Greetings Inc., the greeting-card company that a group led by former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon bought from RCA Corp. in 1982. Gibson went public in May 1983 at an attention-getting premium, setting off the flood of reverse-LBOs that followed.    Friday Gibson, which has never been a spectacular performer for its public OTC investors, closed at $13.75, up 12.5 cents a share. A year ago the issue traded at $16 a share. Currently, the price is nearly unchanged from the $25 a share at which Gibson first traded on Nasdaq in 1983, taking into account a 1985 split.    Among some of the LBOs that went public in 1987 and now are trading on Nasdaq, Budget Rent-A-Car Corp. closed Friday at $11.13 a share, down 20% from its initial trading price last May of $13.88. The company went private in September 1986. It is currently about half-owned by Transamerica Corp. and insiders.    Western Auto Supply, which went private in December 1985, and public again last January, initially traded at $13.25 a share and closed Friday at $7.75 a share. William Simon and his associates still control more than 15% of Western Auto's stock.    Among some of the largest former LBOs to hit Nasdaq last year, Albany International Corp., which makes paper clothing, has slipped to $13.75 from an initial $15.88 when it was offered in September. Its shares are currently worth $226 million in the marketplace, including those held by insiders.    Among the most depressed 1987 newly public LBOs, Cato Corp., which operates an apparel chain, has slipped to $4 a share from its $11.88 offering price in April. Continental Homes Holdings, which began OTC trading last February at $12 a share, closed Friday at $4.63. Hunter-Melnor Inc., which makes fans, closed Friday at $3.50; it debuted in June at $9. Multi-Color Corp., which makes product labels, has slipped to $8 from its initial price of $13.75 in August; and Spectramed Inc. which makes physiological monitors, closed Friday at $2.50, down from the $10.75 at which it first traded in June. </TEXT></DOC>
