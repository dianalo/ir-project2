 However, the newcut-throat economic climate has necessitated that nearly all Canadiancompanies look beyond their shores for new markets and sources of materials.andM;Given this internationalization of business, Canadian firms must understandand adjust for forces that increase their exposure in the worldwidemarketplace.andM;One critical force all-too-often overlooked is the multi-currency environmentof international trade.andP;  The need to buy and sell in a variety of currenciesother than dollars presents two critical points of exposure for companieslarge and small: currency exposure and financial reporting and accounting.andM;Changes in exchange rates can have a material effect upon profitability,especially when a company extends or accepts credit.andP;  A simple exampleillustrates the problem of losses due to exchange rate movements.andM;A Canadian company sells goods worth $10,000 to a U.S.andP;  company and offers 30days credit.andP;  At the time of the sale, the value of the goods is $8,112(U.S.) based on an exchange rate of 81.12 cents for each Canadian dollarconverted to U.S.andP;  dollars.andP;  After 30 days, the $8,112 payment is made but,when converted to Canadian dollars, the Canadian company receives only $9,618Canadian dollars.andM;The discrepancy between the selling price and the amount received reflectsthe change in the exchange rate of 81.12 cents to 78 cents during theintervening month, causing a $382 (Cdn.) loss.andM;Such a situation is called a realized loss because now that the transactionis over it can be quantified.andP;  The same consideration also applies to arealized profit when it occurs.andP;  In either case, factors such as the lengthof time before payment and the volatility of the currency involved can have anegative effect on the firm's financial statements.andM;The company can employ a variety of tactics to safeguard against shifts incurrency value.andP;  These techniques include:andM;* Trade in the domestic currency.andP;  This is the preferred option of manycompanies, but we do not always have the economic muscle to demand all-dollartransactions and, with the value of the dollar falling against manycurrencies, all-dollar exchanges are not always desirable.andM;* Deposit known amounts of foreign currency for payment of debts at fixeddates in the future.andP;  A form of hedge.andP;  This implies, however, that a companyhas the expertise to create foreign currency reserves in lieu of investingthese funds in more profitable instruments, servicing debt, or maintaining ahealthy cash flow.andM;* Match revenue and costs that arise from the trading of goods and servicesin any particular foreign currency.andP;  Logically, the company wants to ensurethat the payment after the credit period is adjusted to remain equal to theoriginal value at the time of sale.andP;  Practically, however, in a highlycompetitive situation the shifting of the burden to the other party mayjeopardize the ability to make the purchase or sale.andM;* Trade in a host of currencies to spread the risk of an adverse currencymovement on one currency against the gains in others.andP;  This option is oftenthe safest bet because, in the long run, the issue of currency fluctuation isfunctionally neutralized without having an impact upon any given purchase orsale.andP;  However, playing the currency market is itself a fine art mastered byfew companies and, to cover the bases effectively, a company must be engagedin a high degree of foreign trade around the world.andP;  Not many firms caneffectively manage this level of international trade or can make the internalinvestment in currency manipulation expertise.andM;* Purchase foreign currency protection through foreign currency contracts (FXcontract).andP;  The most common form of hedge.andP;  An FX contract is an agreement tosell or buy an amount of foreign currency from a bank at a fixed rate on aspecific date in the future.andP;  This protects the company from any adversemovements in the relative value of the currency.andM;The real costs of the FX contract vary with the size of the contract itselfand is measured by the &quot;spread,&quot; which is the difference between the present(or spot) exchange rates and the future exchange rates with respect to thetwo currencies' respective interest rates.andM;The FX contract has the virtue of rationalizing the process, for the cost ofprotection against currency fluctuations is fixed and predictable.andP;  However,these costs must be passed on and accounted for either through pricing or theoverall profitability of the company.andM;Regardless of what tactic a company chooses to cope with the roller coasterof changing currency values, the financial manager must still integratemulti-currency accounting into his overall accounting system.andP;  Thisintegration requires computer software that is both specialized foraddressing multi-currency issues, and flexible for easy integration into thecompany's overall computerized accounting system.andM;When implementing a worldwide accounting standard, the financial manager willneed to consider three problem areas:andM;* Determining supplemental accounting features required for multi-currencyinteractions.andP;  Any multinational software vendor can supply checklists toassist in this straightforward process.andM;* Addressing local needs with accounting software that defines and works inthe functional currency, keeps records in compliance with the local tax codeand requirements, and provides a systematic reporting structure for localmanagement and statutory bodies.andP;  The software must be sufficiently flexibleto cope with local needs and to encourage local co-operation with the homeoffice.andP;  Specific facilities the software should have include establishing afunctional currency for record keeping (the functional currency would beeither the local currency or Canadian dollars, whichever is more appropriateto meet local management needs); defining the structure of the chart ofaccounts; creating an analysis hierarchy for management reporting; and,development of report formats for compliance with the requirements set forthby tax and statutory bodies.andM;* Tackling the problem of consolidating and translating foreign subsidiaryresults into a comprehensive group report.andP;  Section 1650 of the Handbook ofthe Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants defines the requirements forCanadian multinational corporations to translate and consolidate theirforeign currency financial statements.andP;  A number of functions are needed inthe structure of the software in order to meet these compliance regulationsincluding translation tables for currency rates; selective revaluationcapabilities; multi-level consolidation hierarchies; procedures forelimination and adjustment entries; and, flexible report writers accommodating differing charts of account.andM;Spin-off benefits of the functions listed above include the ability to trackgroup as well as local exposure in currencies and to assist in reportinggains and losses by currency.andP;  Both of these benefits allow more efficientcurrency risk management with consequent positive effects on the bottom line.andM;Clearly, multi-currency software is critical at the functional, day-to-daylevel of financial accounting and reporting.andP;  But for the CFO, the realvirtue of multi-currency software is as a decision-making tool to plot short-and long-term strategy, monitor ongoing profitability and adjust to changesin the international marketplace.andM;The key to getting maximum strategic use from multi-currency software issystem-wide integration and standardization.andP;  Most North American companiescompeting in an international marketplace face a difficult problem: how toreconcile and interconnect the various financial computer hardware platformsand software applications in use throughout the world.andM;Three scenarios are played out most often:andM;* Mandate a purely Canadian software package for use by all internationaldivisions.andP;  This answers the home office reporting needs, but can causetremendous problems for the international offices for whom the software maynot be applicable for local accounting and reporting requirements.andP;  Nor doesthis ensure that the software can be used on the differing operating systemsin place around the world.andM;* Assume a laissez-faire approach.andP;  Letting each office solve itsmulti-currency accounting problems in its own way may solve short-term localneeds, but it is an expensive and inefficient answer.andM;* Choose a company-wide standard.andP;  This option is the most practical, for theright company-wide standard financial software accommodating local and homeoffice multi-currency needs has a number of virtues:andM;- Satisfaction of local and home office needs.andP;  Both parties would have thesoftware they require to account, monitor, and report -- without sacrificingfeatures for the &quot;good&quot; of other parts of the company.andM;- Completely integrated vertical reporting.andP;  Local data would be integrateddirectly into home office data without re-inputting the information, savingvaluable time and money.andM;- Systemwide use and compatibility.andP;  The same software would be used on eachhardware platform/operating system employed by the company -- eg.andP;  DOS, VMS,Unix, AS/400 -- or within a given type of hardware (eg.andP;  all DEC machines).andO;Moreover, the software would have the same look, feel and responsiveness,regardless of the system upon which the software is running.andM;North American companies must adapt to a multi-currency environment in orderto compete successfully in the international marketplace.andP;  Miscalculations oncurrency exposure can cost millions in the buying and selling of goods andservices.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
