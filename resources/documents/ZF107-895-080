It's no secret that the skies aren't asfriendly as they used to be.andP;  During the past ten years, the number of airpassengers has nearly doubled.andP;  Yet not a single major new airport has beenbuilt.andP;  Not surprisingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reportsthat air travelers experienced a record number of flight delays during thefirst half of 1989.andM;To help fix the nation's air traffic mess, FAA officials are looking toSimmod, a software package that simulates airplane traffic.andP;  Simmod spotsbottle-necks, frees airborne stop-and-go traffic, and tests the feasibilityof new flights and runways.andP;  The FAA worked with the ATAC Corporation,American Airlines Decision Technologies, the Mitre Corporation, and CACIProducts Company to develop Simmod.andM;Simmod masters an air-traffic network far too Byzantine for mere mortals.andO;Using the program, planners can test in a matter of minutes how added flightsor the building of a proposed runway would affect traffic in the skies.andM;&quot;You may think you're increasing capacity by building a new runway,&quot; explainsJohn Bobick, director of aviation systems at the ATAC Corporation, theMountain View, California, company that designed the airspace portion ofSimmod.andP;  &quot;But more concrete won't do you any good unless you have theairspace to handle the additional traffic.&quot;andM;Already the FAA has unleashed Simmod on the congested air-traffic corridorsover Boston, Chicago, Denver, Dallas--Fort Worth, and Los Angeles--and gottenresults.andP;  &quot;Simmod helped restructure airspace in the Los Angeles basin sothat the area can accommodate 50 percent more traffic without increasingflight delays,&quot; says Dave Winer, a division manager in the FAA's Office ofOperations and Research.andM;The model works much like an intricate connect-the-dots puzzle.andP;  An airportand its surrounding airspace is represented by a constellation of nodes thatcorrespond to air and ground space.andP;  Each node has a number, and Simmodtracks all arriving and departing aircraft as it moves from node to node.andM;Planners can run an existing or proposed flight schedule through the modeland simulate the approaches, landings, taxiing activity, and departures fromvirtually any airport in the world.andP;  They can also use the model to figurethe optimum location of new runways, radar, and gates.andP;  The graphics letplanners see where traffic backs up.andM;Simmod simultaneously models air traffic at more than one airport,visualizing for planners how local and national air traffic can be bettercoordinated.andP;  &quot;You can't act in isolation,&quot; notes Bobick.andP;  Changes at the SanFrancisco airport, for example, affect operations at both Oakland and SanJose.andM;With the FAA and a growing number of airlines, airport authorities, andaviation consultants relying on Simmod software, beleaguered air travelersmay have cause to hope for safer and more timely flights.andM;What's more, in the capital-intensive airline business, it's a relativelyinexpensive tool.andP;  Cost projections for the new airport planned for Denver,Colorado, for instance, are $2.3 billion.andP;  Simmod costs only $500.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
