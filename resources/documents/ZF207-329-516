 These include a high-levelmachine interface, object-oriented design, single-level addressability,highly integrated system functions, an integrated relational database andadvanced engineering.andM;These architectural features effectively hide the complexity of the systemfrom programmers, operators and users through the use of a single systeminterface.andP;  This results in a substantial reduction in the cost of ownershipof the system, particularly in support areas such as systems programming,database support, network management, operations and software.andM;The architecture of the AS/400 defines a logical machine instruction set at avery high level, as illustrated in the figure.andP;  This high-level instructionset is called the machine interface.andP;  Many functions traditionally performedby mainframe operating systems are supported as basic instructions in themachine interface.andP;  For example, ''Create Object'' is a singlemachine-interface instruction.andM;The high-level interface isolates applications developers from machineimplementations.andP;  The approach accommodates changes in the machine'sunderlying technology without any impact on applications.andM;No Conversion NecessaryandM;In effect, applications developed on current models of the AS/400 will beable to take advantage of new technologies without requiring conversion.andM;The AS/400 is an object-oriented system.andP;  Programs, data files, queues,libraries, device descriptions, user profiles -- all are autonomous objectsthat interact by passing messages to one another.andP;  Access to objects is byobject name rather than object location -- a key characteristic ofobject-oriented systems.andP;  The object-oriented design of the AS/400 frees theapplications programmer from low-level concerns with information retrievaland storage.andP;  It also provides a uniform interface to all objects, a highdegree of data protection and integrity, and powerful security features.andM;An object can be visualized as a container holding information.andP;  Objectsconsist of a functional portion and an associated storage space.andP;  Thefunctional portion of an object stores a definition of the object, whichincludes the object name, object type and object authorization.andP;  In this way,the AS/400 ensures that only operations valid for the object type areperformed against the object, and only authorized users gain access to theobject.andM;On the AS/400, single-level addressability makes main memory and mass storageappear to the programmer as a single, enormous pool of memory.andP;  All objectsare accessed by name; programs and database objects are shared rather thanhaving individual copies for each user, and all objects appear to bepermanently resident in a single large memory.andP;  Single-level storage freesthe applications developer from disk- and memory-management constraints, andallows an application to be independent of the configuration of the targetplatform.andM;Single-level addressability requires a very large virtual-memory address toaccommodate all the primary and secondary storage on the system.andP;  The AS/400supports a 48-bit address that allows more than 281 trillion bytes ofinformation to be individually addressed.andP;  This is significantly larger thanthe maximum 31-bit address supported on IBM's System/370 mainframes.andM;IBM intends to expand the AS/400 even more.andP;  Already the AS/400 designsupports expansion to a 64-bit address that can access more than 18quintillion bytes of virtual memory.andP;  Thus, the AS/400 is positioned toexploit new high-capacity storage technologies as they become availableduring the 1990s.andM;Single-level addressability does have a serious disadvantage.andP;  If one storagedevice fails and the data on it cannot be recovered, it may be necessary toreload all the data on all the storage devices on the system, because asegment of nearly every object on the system may well have been resident onthe damaged device.andP;  Very long recovery times are the inevitable result.andM;IBM has sought to address this problem on the System/38 and AS/400 byimproving the reliability of direct-access storage devices, providingrecovery-support aids such as journaling and checksum protection, andintroducing specialized data-recovery utilities to its technical-supportpersonnel.andP;  Facilities to maintain mirror-image copies of files on-line are alogical next step.andM;Focus on Integration, SimplicityandM;Integration and simplicity are the central elements of the AS/400 design.andO;Many functions implemented with separate systems-software products ontraditional mainframe systems are integrated into the AS/400 hardware andoperating-system software.andP;  These integrated functions include transactionprocessing, database and resource management, system security andcommunications.andM;In contrast, the layered software components of conventional mainframesystems result in an overlap of functions and inconsistencies.andP;  Because eachsoftware component in conventional systems is a self-contained entity,functions found in one component may be repeated in others.andP;  In addition,highly trained support personnel with specialized skills are needed to manageand control each specialized software component.andM;The AS/400 was designed from the ground up to be an interactive, multiusermachine.andP;  Architectural features such as single-level addressability areparticularly well-suited to an interactive, multiuser environment.andM;All application programs on the AS/400 are automatically compiled asre-entrant modules, so one physical copy of the code is shared by multipleusers of the program.andP;  This provides efficient use of storage, andtransaction-processing support is fully integrated with the operating-systemsoftware.andP;  No expensive specialists or laborious tricks of coding arerequired.andP;  Most significantly for users, interactive processing on the AS/400does not ''go down.'' The norm is 100 percent reliability.andM;Integrated Relational DatabaseandM;The AS/400 database-management system is based on the relational model, andis integrated with both the operating system and the machine.andP;  This providesefficient performance for the information system because operations areperformed below the machine-interface level in a combination of microcode andhardware.andP;  Moreover, the integrity of the data is guaranteed because of theintegration of security at the object level.andM;The database implementation supports two kinds of files: physical andlogical.andP;  A physical file is a data structure consisting of rows (or records)and columns (or fields), each having the same field attributes and recordlength.andP;  Logical files provide alternative views of the database and may becreated dynamically.andP;  This flexibility of function, in combination with theperformance and integrity of the AS/400, provides strong support for userinformation-retrieval systems and contributes to a reduction in dataredundancy.andM;The AS/400 hardware incorporates a number of sophisticated engineeringfeatures not usually found in midrange computer systems.andP;  The main processorin high-end AS/400 models incorporates IBM's fastest bipolar chip technology,with a cycle time of 60 nanoseconds, and megabit memory chips.andM;The AS/400 has been called the SAA machine.andP;  Next week I'll examine theextent to which the AS/400 has been integrated with IBM's Systems ApplicationArchitecture.andM;----------The James Martin Productivity Series, an information service updatedquarterly, is available through High Productivity Software Inc., ofMarblehead, Mass.andP;  (800) 242-1240.andP;  For information on seminars, pleasecontact (in the United States and Canada) Technology Transfer Institute, 74110th St., Santa Monica, Calif.andP;  90402 (213) 394-8305.andP;  In Europe, contactSavant, 2 New St., Carnforth, Lancs., LA5 9BX United Kingdom (0524) 734 505.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
