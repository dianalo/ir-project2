Consolidated Fuel seeks approval to import the volumesfor a term of 15 years from the date of commercial operation of the cogenerationfacility, which is estimated to be in July 1990. In addition, the applicantrequests authority to import from Direct Energy or others up to 500 Mcfof gas per day on a spot basis to supply the cogeneration facility duringpeak usage periods.The application is filed pursuant to section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA)and DOE Delegation Order Nos. 0204-111 and 0204-127.

Thearea where the cogeneration facility will be located currently has accessonly to Canadian gas. The owners of Arrowhead's general partner, ArrowheadCogeneration Corp., have an ownership interest in Consolidated Fuel.On November 16, 1987, Arrowhead's cogeneration facility received certificationfrom the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as a qualifying facilityunder the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). The cogenerationfacility will provide electrical power to the UNITIL Power Corporationin Exeter, New Hampshire, and steam produced by the facility will be soldto a food processing plant owned by Wyeth Nutritional, Inc.The natural gas purchased from Direct Energy, a Canadian producer-ownedmarketing company, would enter the U.S. at a point near Philipsburg, Quebec,through pipeline facilities of Vermont Gas Systems, Inc. (Vermont Gas),which would then deliver the gas to the cogeneration facility. The onlyadditional facilities needed to transport the gas to Arrowhead's plantis a three-mile connecting pipeline to be constructed by Vermont Gas betweenits system and the plant. Consolidated Fuel states that Vermont gas willapply for the necessary regulatory approval from the Vermont Public ServiceBoard to construct the delivery pipeline.Under the terms of a November 22, 1988, sales agreement between ConsolidatedFuel and Direct Energy, which provides for 6,000 Mcf per day of firm servicefor a term of 15 years, Consolidated Fuel is required to take and pay fora minimum annual quantity equal to 80 percent of the daily contract quantity.In addition, the agreement calls for Consolidated Fuel to use reasonableefforts to have delivered a minimum of 4,000 Mcf of gas per day. The contractalso provides that Consolidated Fuel may buy on an interruptible basisvolumes of gas above the 6,000 Mcf daily contract quantity, provided thatDirect Energy has such gas available.The gas would be sold to Consolidated Fuel at a price which includes actualtransportation charges for the gas on Canadian pipelines, compressor fueland take-or-pay cost sharing charges incurred by Direct Energy, and a commoditycharge. Transportation of the gas in Canada would be provided by the pipelinesystems of NOVA Corporation of Alberta, TransGas Limited, and TransCanadaPipeLines Limited. The commodity charge would be indexed to the publishedNew England Power Pool (NEPOOL) fossil energy costs. The commodity chargewould be determined each month by multiplying $1.004 (U.S.) per Mcf bythe ratio of the weighted NEPOOL average fossil fuel cost for the precedingmonth to that for the month of July 1988. In an April 11, 1989, letter,Consolidated Fuel indicated the NEPOOL index formula would result in adelivered commodity charge of $1.248 (U.S.) per MMBtu for February 1989.Finally, the gas purchase agreement requires that Direct Energy maintainat all times a minimum of 10.8 Bcf of gas reserves to meet its supply obligation.The decision on this application will be made consistent with the DOE'sgas import policy guidelines, under which the competitiveness of an importarrangement in the markets served is the primary consideration in determiningwhether it is in the public interest (49 FR 6684, February 22, 1984). Othermatters that may be considered in making a public interest determinationinclude need for gas, security of the long-term supply and any relevantissues that are unique to cogeneration facilities. Parties that may opposethis application should comment in their responses on the issues of competitiveness,need for the natural gas, and security of supply as set forth in the policyguidelines. The applicant asserts that this import arrangement is in thepublic interest. Parties opposing the arrangement bear the burden of overcomingthis assertion.All parties should be aware that if this requested long-term import isapproved, the authorization may be conditioned to require that ConsolidatedFuel file quarterly reports to facilitate the DOE's monitoring of its naturalgas import and export program. <ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Compliance </ITAG>Under section D of the DOE guidelines for compliance with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq</T3>., actions that grant or deny import authorizations whereno new gas transmission facilities are needed but where new ancillary facilitiesare to be constructed, such as a cogeneration facility, would normallyrequire the preparation of an environmental assessment (EA), because theyinvolve ``minor new construction'' (54 FR 12474, March 27, 1989). However,we believe that preparation of an EA to approve or disapprove ConsolidatedFuel's application is unnecessary, and compliance with NEPA for the proposedaction can be achieved by invoking two categorical exclusions in the DOENEPA guidelines (52 FR 47622, December 15, 1987). The environmental impacts of constructing and operating new cogenerationfacilities have been addressed on numerous occasions by the Economic RegulatoryAdministration (ERA) in conjunction with processing exemption petitionsunder the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act (FUA) (10 U.S.C. 3801<T3>et seq.</T3>, as amended) and as a result, such actions have been granteda categorical exclusion from further NEPA review (52 FR 47670, December15, 1987). The cogeneration facilities to be constructed in connectionwith these import applications are identical to those facilities coveredby the categorical exclusion for FUA actions. Therefore, it is an appropriateapplication of another categorical exclusion contained in the DOE guidelinesfor ``actions that are substantially the same as other actions for whichthe environmental effects have already been assessed in a NEPA documentand determined by DOE to be clearly insignificant and where such assessmentis currently valid'' (52 FR 47668, December 15, 1987) to extend the FUAcategorical exclusion for cogeneration facilities to the grant of an authorizationto import natural gas under the NGA which results in the construction andoperation of a cogeneration facility. A categorical exclusion raises a rebuttable presumption that the Federalaction will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment.Unless it appears during the proceedings on this import application thatthe grant or denial of authorization will significantly affect the qualityof the human environment, the Office of Fuels Programs expects that noadditional environmental review will be required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable, and written comments. Any personwishing to become a party to the proceeding and to have the written commentsconsidered as the basis for any decision on the applicant must, however,file a motion to intervene or notice of intervention, as applicable. Thefiling of a protest with respect to this application will not serve tomake the protestant a party to the proceeding, although protests and commentsreceived from persons who are not parties will be considered in determiningthe appropriate action to be taken on the application. All protests, motionsto intervene, notices of intervention, and written comments must meet therequirements that are specified by the regulations in 10 CFR Part 590.Protests, motions to intervene, notices of intervention, requests for additionalprocedures, and written comments should be filed with the Office of FuelsPrograms, Fossil Energy, Room 3F-056, FE-50, Forrestal Building 1000 IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586-9478.
