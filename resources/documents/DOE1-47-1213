In our younger societythis is due largely to a preocupation with physical conditioning, butin our elderly population it is due to improved recognition and bettermethods of detection and diagnosis. Stress fracture of the elderly isan insufficiency fracture which occurs in the spine, the pelvis, thesacrum and other bones afflicted with disorders which cause osteopenia.Stress fracture is frequently misdiagnosed as a malignant lesion of boneresulting in biopsy. Scintiscanning provides the greatest frequency ofdetection, while computed tomography often provides the definitive diagnosis.With increased interest and experience a better insight into the diseasehas been achieved, and what was once thought of as a simple manifestationof mechanical stress is now known to be an orderly, complex pattern ofphysiological changes in bone which conform to a model by Frost. Thediffuse nature of these changes can be recognized by scintigraphy, radiographyand magnetic resonance imaging. 27 refs.; 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
