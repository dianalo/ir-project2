OttenStaff Reporter of The Wall Stret Journal</HL><DD> 09/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) </IN><TEXT>   A competent, informed patient should have the right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatments, including artificial feeding and hydration, a broadly based group of medical ethics specialists declared.    And if the patient is incompetent, a properly designated surrogate should have the right to make this choice for the patient, they said.    The 20-member study group completed more than two years of meetings and deliberations with a report setting forth comprehensive ethical &quot;Guidelines on the Termination of Life-Sustaining Treatment and the Care of the Dying.&quot; The panel -- doctors, lawyers, nurses, medical administrators and ethicists -- was organized by the Hastings Center, a bioethical think tank in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.    The 153-page report is designed to provide helpful and often very specific counsel for patients and their families, doctors and other health care professionals and hospitals and nursing homes. It could also be useful to legislatures and courts considering the subject.    Right-to-die issues have grown steadily more acute as medical and scientific progress continue to find new ways to prolong life. &quot;Extending life is usually, but not always, a good,&quot; the Hastings report said. &quot;The patient's life, for example, may be full of pain or suffering and the patient may prefer to forgo the treatment even though it means an earlier death.&quot; When an informed, competent patient so decides, the report continued, &quot;It is ethically acceptable (for health care providers) to withhold or withdraw the treatment.&quot;    Doctors and other professionals would, of course, provide advice and guidance to the patient in reaching a decision, the group said, but in the final analysis, the patient or the patient's surrogate should be able to decide.    The guidelines are meant to apply to terminally ill and dying patients, the gravely impaired, the critically ill, and others &quot;not necessarily in danger of imminent death but . . . facing a decision about the use of a life-sustaining treatment.&quot;    Life-sustaining treatment is defined as including not only ventilators, dialysis and cardiopulmonary resuscitation but also antibiotics and other medication and intravenous and nasogastric tubes and other artificial feeding and hydration methods.    Although the provision of food and water obviously has strong symbolic and psychological importance for many people, the group said, intravenous lines, nasogastric tubes and other artificial methods are nonetheless invasive procedures, and, therefore, it is &quot;wisest and most plausible&quot; to regard them as &quot;medical interventions that may be forgone in some cases.&quot; However, the group added, since this question only recently has received widespread consideration, &quot;caution is necessary&quot; in applying this finding.    The report urged that patients forgoing life-sustaining treatment be given all possible palliative care and pain relief to make the dying process as comfortable and painless as possible.    Though endorsing a patient's right to reject life-sustaining treatment, the report comes down against assisted suicide or active euthanasia -- mercy killing. Society prohibits these even when the motive is compassionate, the group said. It argued that &quot;a reasonable, if not unambiguous, line&quot; can and should be drawn between honoring a patient's refusal of treatment on the one hand and giving active euthanasia or assisting suicide on the other.    The report noted that many doctors find it harder to withdraw treatment than to withhold it in the first place, but insisted that there really is no ethical distinction. In fact, the report added, it probably is better to start treatment on an experimental basis and then stop it if it does no good or proves too burdensome.    Throughout the guidelines, the group stressed the desirability of people giving advance thought to the kind of care they want at the end of life and making their wishes known through living wills, designation of surrogate decision makers and advance discussion with family and doctors.    A surrogate making decisions for an incompetent patient should whenever possible follow the patient's explicit advance directives, the report said. If these aren't available, the surrogate should decide on what he knows of the patient's preferences and values, trying to choose as the patient would have wanted. And if there is insufficient knowledge of these values, the surrogate should act as a reasonable person would in the patient's circumstances. </TEXT></DOC>
