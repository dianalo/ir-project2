(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorneys for three men convicted ofsmuggling a bomb into the United States say they won't appeal theprison terms of up to 16 years given to their clients.   The government alleged the three men, who are natives of Lebanonand hold Canadian citizenship, are members of a Syrian politicalgroup responsible for several acts of terrorism.   But U.S. District Judge Albert Coffrin told the men Wednesday itdidn't matter to him whether they belonged to an extremistpolitical party; his concern was that the explosive device they hadbeen carrying could have caused serious damage.   ``The lethal potential, however, is clear,'' Coffrin said. ``Anyvictim of a bombing is an innocent victim.''   Defendant Georges Younan and co-defendant Walid Kabbani eachreceived a 16-year sentence in federal prison. Walid Mourad, whopleaded guilty one day before the others went to trial, wassentenced to eight years in prison.   Younan had faced the stiffest penalty, up to 35 years in prison.Mourad had faced 10 years in prison, and Kabbani, 30 years and sixmonths.   Younan and Kabbani pleaded innocent but never testified at theirtrial. None of the three addressed Coffrin during the sentencinghearing. Instead, they chose to have their attorneys speak for them.   ``He says, `I'm not a terrorist,''' Kabbani's attorney MarkKeller said. ``He simply says, `I know what I am.' ... He asked menot to beg on his behalf, not to grovel on his behalf.''   The defense attorneys claimed victory with the sentences, sayingthe government had proposed a plea bargain in which 20-year prisonterms were offered in exchange for a guilty plea and cooperationwith the government.   The three were arrested last October and charged with smugglinga homemade bomb into the United States through Richford, a smalltown on the Vermont-Canadian border. The U.S. government claimedthe three were members of a terrorist group responsible for the1982 assassination of a Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel.   Their attorneys described them as mere bunglers as opposed toprofessional terrorists.   U.S. Attorney George Terwilliger III and the FBI, however, saidthe three men are members of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.The group was founded in the fascist era of the 1930s and wasdevoted to the formation of ``Greater Syria'' that encompassedseveral Middle East nations.   Younan's cousin says Younan is a member of the party, but deniedthat it was a terrorist group. Attorneys for Kabbani and Mouraddenied their clients were members at all.   Terwilliger said he felt the sentence was appropriate. ``It'sone of a very few incidents involving a person associated withMiddle Eastern terrorist organization actually being in possessionof explosives on U.S. soil,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
