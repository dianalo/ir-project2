To minimize aggregation,particle-particle repulsion can be controlled through localized chemicalinteractions (polymer adsorption and steric repulsion). This conditionis paramount for the production of low-void density ceramics preparedusing colloidal processing techniques. 9 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
