L-phenylalaninein CF/sub 3/COOH trapped /sup 18/F-AcOF more effectively than /sup 18/F-F/sub2/. The main product was ortho-/sup 18/F-fluorophenylalanine when /sup18/F-AcOF was used as a reagent. Lower radiochemical yield of /sup 18/F-fluorophenyl-alaninesand significant formation of by-product were observed in the case of/sup 18/F-F/sub 2/.</TEXT></DOC>
