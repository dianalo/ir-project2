A note to that effect was not made public in court, although the42-page admission was.   An official who saw the note, commenting on condition he not benamed, said it was at the bottom of a cover letter to U.S. DistrictJudge Gerhard A. Gesell from independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.   The statement of facts, agreed to by both the government andNorth's lawyers, was introduced to avoid the risks of nationalsecurity secrets being disclosed through testimony or documentsthat might be put in evidence.   Among the disclosures in the admission was that George Bush,then vice president, told the president of Honduras that his nationwould be getting expedited U.S. military and economic aid. Earliertestimony had indicated then-President Reagan told the Honduranpresident such help would be forthcoming in return for hisassisting the Nicaraguan guerrillas.   Bush has declined to comment on the matter, saying it couldprejudice the North trial. Privately, some State Department andWhite House officials have expressed frustration with the document,saying it does not faithfully represent events as they occurred.</TEXT></DOC>
