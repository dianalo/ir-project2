Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to a thermally responsive valve for an engine      of a motor vehicle and more particularly, to an improved thermally      responsive valve which includes an upper housing having an inlet port, an      outlet port, a cylindrical chamber, and a main chamber; a lower housing      having a longitudinally elongated aperture, a thermal transmitting cover      and a thermal expansion member such as wax; and a movable shaft piston      disposed within the main chamber of the upper housing and the      longitudinally elongated aperture of the lower housing. The movable shaft      piston contacts the thermal expansion member at one end and has a      compression spring at its other end, whereby upon expansion or shrinkage      of the thermal expansion member in response to engine body temperature,      the movable shaft piston moves upward or downward and causes the      cylindrical chamber to close or reopen by means of the top portion      blocking or re-establishing communication between the inlet port and the      outlet port of the upper housing. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Various types of thermally responsive valves for detecting the temperature      of an engine of motor vehicles are known. Such thermally responsive valves      are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,841,551 to Ota, U.S. Pat. No. 3,960,321 to      Steele, U.S. Pat. No. 4,000,849 to Steele et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,036,433      to Wagner et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,128,203 to Malthy, U.S. Pat. No.      4,133,349 to Stripling, U.S. Pat. No. 4,165,035 to Maltby, U.S. Pat. No.      4,185,663 to Stripling, U.S. Pat. No. 4,239,152 to Kitamura et al, U.S.      Pat. No. 4,285,467 to Maltby, U.S. Pat. No. 4,335,690 to Hosokawa et al,      U.S. Pat. No. 4,375,873 to Enomoto et al, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,386,732 to      Satomoto. However, these thermally responsive valves can be inconvenient      or unreliable. Also, most of such thermally responsive valves are      bimetallic element assemblies. Such bimetallic element assemblies suffer      from a number of disadvantages such as, for example, (a) it is very      difficult for the on/off system of such assemblies to actuate suddenly,      since after the temperature increases to a predetermined temperature, such      assemblies tend to return to the original position, (b) it is difficult      for an on/off system of such assemblies to be inefficiently completed, and      (c) since the bimetallic element material of such assemblies is not so      good for detecting the heat, it has to be replaced after a short time      period. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a      thermally responsive valve for an engine of a motor vehicle. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved thermally      responsive valve which includes: an upper housing having an inlet port, an      outlet port, a cylindrical chamber, and a main chamber; a lower housing      having a longitudinally elongated aperture, a thermal transmitting cover      and a thermal expansion member such as wax; and a movable shaft piston      disposed within the main chamber of the upper housing and the      longitudinally elongated aperture of the lower housing. The movable shaft      piston contacts the thermal expansion member at one end and has a      compression spring at its other end, whereby upon expansion or shrinkage      of the thermal expansion member in response to engine temperature, the      movable shaft piston moves upward or downward and causes the cylindrical      chamber to close or reopen by means of the top portion of the movable      shaft piston blocking or re-establishing communication between the inlet      port and the outlet port of the upper housing. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved      thermally responsive valve which is simple in construction, compact for      portability, inexpensive to manufacture, and has a long time period of      operation. </PAR><PAR>  Other objects and further scope of applicability of the present invention      will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. It      should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific      examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are      given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications      within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those      skilled in the art from this detailed description. </PAR><PAR>  Briefly described, the present invention relates to a thermally responsive      valve for detecting the temperature of an engine of motor vehicles, which      comprises an upper housing having an inlet port, an outlet port, and a      cylindrical chamber; a lower housing with thermal expansion member in a      thermal transmitting cover; and a movable shaft piston movably disposed      within an elongated aperture in the lower housing. One end of the movable      shaft piston is operatively connected to the cylindrical chamber for      closing or opening the inlet port and the other end of the movable shaft      piston is connected to the thermal expansion member through a diaphragm on      top of the thermal expansion member for moving the movable shaft piston      upward or downward. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed      description given hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings which are      given by way of illustration only, and thus are not limitative of the      present invention, and wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a longitudinal sectional view of the thermally responsive valve      according to the present invention showing in a normal state position; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a longitudinal sectional view of the thermally responsive valve      according to the present invention showing in a operation state position;      and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a longitudinal sectional view of another embodiment of the      thermally responsive valve according to the present invention in a normal      state position. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Referring now in detail to the drawings for the purpose of illustrating      preferred embodiments of the present invention, the thermally responsive      valve for detecting the temperature of an engine of a motor vehicle as      shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 comprises an upper housing 1 and a lower housing 2      connected to the upper housing 1 in an airtight fashion. The airtight      connection is ensured by a O-ring 13 provided between the upper and lower      housings 1 and 2. Preferably, one end of the upper housing 1 is fitted      into an opening 14 of the lower housing 2 and then the opening 14 is      crimped around the upper housing 1. The other end of the lower housing 2      is connected to thermal transmitting cover 5 also in an airtight fashion.      The upper housing 1 together with the lower housing 2 having the thermal      transmitting cover 5 form a housing assembly which can be attached to an      engine body 12 (not shown) by means of a threaded portion 15 formed on the      periphery of the lower housing 2. Therefore, the housing assembly can come      in contact with a thermal medium such as an engine coolant. </PAR><PAR>  The upper housing 1 includes an inlet port 1', an outlet port 1&quot;, and a      cylindrical chamber 16' connecting the inlet port 1' to a main chamber 16.      A diaphragm 3 is disposed between the lower housing 2 and the thermal      transmitting cover 5 so as to enclose a hollow portion 17 formed in the      cover 5. The hollow portion 17 of the cover 5 contains a thermal expansion      member 3 such as, for example, wax. A movable shaft piston 6 is movably      located within a longitudinally elongated aperture 18 vertically disposed      in the center of the lower housing 2 and the main chamber 16 of the upper      housing 1. A compression spring 9 is wound around the upper portion of the      movable shaft piston 6. The compression spring is retained in place at one      end by a washer 8 and a stopping ring 7, and at the other end by a support      ring 11 and a valve seat packing 10. </PAR><PAR>  The thermally responsive valve of the present invention operates as      follows. </PAR><PAR>  Normally, the movable shaft piston 6 is held down by the force of      compression spring 9 so that communication between the inlet port 1' and      the outlet port 1&quot; is established by means of the cylindrical chamber 16'      and the main chamber 16. Therefore, fluid which enters the inlet port 1'      exits through the outlet port 1&quot; as shown in FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  When the temperature of the engine body 12 increases, the temperature of      the engine coolant increases, and the thermal transmitting cover 5      transmits heat to the thermal expansion member 4 and causes the thermal      expansion member 4 to expand suddenly. Therefore, the movable shaft piston      6 moves upward against the compression spring 9 due to the upward movement      of the diaphragm 3 as shown in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  At this time, the movable shaft piston 6 comes into contact with the inner      periphery of the valve seat packing 10 of the upper housing 1. Further      expansion of the thermal expansion member 4 causes the movable shaft      piston 6 to move upward along the longitudinally elongated aperture 18 of      the lower housing 2 so as to keep a close contact with the inner periphery      of the cylindrical chamber 16'. Therefore, the communication of the inlet      port 1' and the outlet port 1&quot; is broken so that fluid which enters inlet      port 1' cannot flow to the outlet port 1&quot; (FIG. 2). </PAR><PAR>  When the temperature of the engine body 12 decreases, the thermal expansion      member 4 shrinks. Therefore, the movable shaft piston 6 will return to its      initial position due to the force of the compression spring 9 (FIG. 1). </PAR><PAR>  It should be noted that since the movable shaft piston 6 is movably fitted      within the longitudinally elongated aperture 18 of the lower housing 2,      the movable shaft piston 6 can move within the cylindrical chamber 16'      without tilting so that the O-ring 13 ensures a reliable seal effect will      not suffer uneven wear. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a longitudinal sectional view illustrating another embodiment of      the thermally responsive valve according to the present invention. This      additional embodiment of the present invention comprises a vertically      elongated diaphragm 63, a movable short shaft piston 60 having a      protective sheet 60' disposed at the lower end thereof for preventing the      fluid such as gasoline from contaminating the thermal expansion member 4      stored in an vertically elongated hollow portion 61 and running the      vertically elongated diaphragm 63. Because the protective sheet 60'      preferably has a larger diameter that the diameter of the movable short      shaft piston 60 and the movable shaft piston 60 having the protective      sheet 60 can slightly move upward and downward through a vertically      elongated guide member 62 disposed in the middle portion of the thermally      responsive valve. The protective sheet 60' is preferably made of TEFLON      (polytetrafluoroethylene). </PAR><PAR>  The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be      varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure      from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as      would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included in      the scope of the following claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
