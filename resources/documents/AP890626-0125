Newsweek reported in its July 3 issue that Leslie Leland, apharmacist on Martha's Vineyard, said that the two men took him fora ride and told him their version of the night's events involvingSen. Edward Kennedy.   ``The bottom line was that this was nothing more than an accidentand a minor vehicle violation _ and there was no need for the grandjury to get involved,'' Leland said.   ``There was a cover-up. All they were concerned about wasprotecting Teddy's political career. It was, like, the hell with thefact that this young woman lost her life.''   Miss Kopechne was killed when the car Kennedy was driving acrossa bridge on the Massachusetts island skidded into 8 feet of water.He surfaced moments later; Miss Kopechne died in the car.   The Massachusetts Democrat failed to report the accident for 10hours. He received a suspended sentence for leaving the scene of anaccident.   Leland's dissatisfaction with the grand jury proceedings has beenmentioned before, most recently in the 1988 book ``SenatorialPrivilege: The Chappaquiddick Coverup'' by Paul Damore. In it,Leland makes no mention of the ride but says he had a variety ofmeetings with officials and felt pressured not to ask certainquestions.   In response to the Newsweek article, Kennedy's office issued astatement in which the senator again expressed remorse for theaccident and said he takes full responsibility for the tragedy.   ``I have told everything I know about the accident. I only wishthat it were in my power to do something more to ease the continuingpain that I feel and that Mr. and Mrs. Kopechne feel for Mary Jo'sloss,'' the statement said.   Press secretary Paul Donovan said there would be no furthercomment.   Newsweek did not identify the lawmen or say when the meeting withLeland occurred.   In the months that followed, Leland received three anonymousdeath threats and for a time was under 24-hour police protection,the magazine reported. He nearly lost his pharmacy license whenstate officials did not send the usual renewal notice.   Leland said that after he had convened the grand jury, aprosecutor warned him to watch his step or the supervising judgemight cite him for contempt. The judge refused to let the grand jurysubpoena witnesses or to review the record of the coroner's inquest,he said.   The grand jury finally gave up and when its term ran out, themembers were sworn to secrecy for the rest of their lives, themagazine said. Newsweek didn't explain why Leland decided to talkabout the case now.   ``They tied us up,'' Leland said. ``They had us handcuffed. Itwas devastating. There were two sets of rules: one for the wealthypolitician _ and the other for you and me.''</TEXT></DOC>
