Although the report by the American Petroleum Institute,released late Wednesday, involved only U.S. inventories,prices of crude oil and fuels fell world-wide in hectictrading.</LP><TEXT>   In European markets, spot prices of North Sea and MiddleEast crudes were down 45 cents to 80 cents a barrel. On theInternational Petroleum Exchange in London, futures prices ofBrent blend crude were 28 cents to 51 cents a barrel lower.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude oil for Julydelivery dropped 68 cents to settle at $17.40 a barrel.August crude was down 60 cents to $18.04.   But the sharpest fall of all was in U.S. gasoline, whichhad ignited the rally that swept through world petroleummarkets earlier this week. In the U.S. futures market, theJune contract for unleaded gasoline fell 2.98 cents a gallonin its last day of trading to settle at 63.89 cents. The Julygasoline futures price was down the limit of two cents agallon to 61.26 cents.   Despite the sharp decline in gasoline futures, industryanalysts maintained that the major factor in this week'spricing reversal is the continuing concern over swollensupplies of crude oil.   &quot;The market is going to maintain its downward momentum,and the pressure is {from} the crude overhang,&quot; said PeterGignoux, manager of Shearson Lehman Hutton's internationalenergy desk in London.   It has been evident for some weeks that the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries has been producing too muchoil. So far, OPEC hasn't made much progress in its early-Mayagreement to reduce output as much as one million barrels aday from the previously indicated April level of 23.5 millionbarrels a day.   The latest assessments by monitors of OPEC output suggestthat May production was down some from April -- but onlymodestly. The OPEC Listener estimated yesterday that Mayproduction was &quot;certainly no lower than 23 million barrels aday&quot; and most likely in the range of 23.2 million barrels aday. &quot;This {June} will be the real test month to show whetherOPEC's `medicine' is working,&quot; the New York-basedindustry-analysis service reported.   But even though OPEC production may be declining, oil fromthe previous high production levels will continue to flowinto the major consuming regions for some weeks. As a result,U.S. crude oil inventories may continue to increase. Andyesterday's sell-off was triggered by the American PetroleumInstitute's latest report, which showed inventories ofgasoline and crude oil rose last week by 1.1 million barrelsand 2.1 million barrels, respectively.   Still, there are some industry analysts who look for crudeinventory levels to quit rising soon. They note that U.S.refineries are expanding operations after maintenanceshutdowns and will be using more crude oil to refine thegasoline to meet seasonal needs.   &quot;By September, crude oil inventories should be at asignificant lower level,&quot; said Robert Boslego, a Winchester,Mass., consultant.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices were lower. The July delivery endedwith a decline of 0.65 cent a pound at $1.1085.Price-depressants included economic indicators that continueto show a slowing U.S. economy and expectations that LondonMetal Exchange copper inventories Friday will show anincrease of 2,000 tons to 3,000 tons, said Fred Demler,metals economist for PaineWebber. He noted that statisticsjust released by the American Bureau of Metal Statistics, aprivate organization, were largely bullish, but contain abearish undertone. Production of mined copper has declined,due to lower output in Peru, Chile and Bougainville, PapuaNew Guinea. Mine production of copper in March was down 5%from a year before, after having gained 5% in January andFebruary, he said. World-wide deliveries of copper byproducers to consumers in the first quarter rose 8% from ayear earlier, but Mr. Demler said that stepped-up pace isn'tlikely to continue. Producers' stocks outside the U.S. havedeclined, but the drop is being offset by a growth ofinventories in the hands of U.S. producers, consumers andboth the London Metal Exchange and New York's CommodityExchange, he said. The two factors that are supporting copperprices currently, he said, are concern over the labornegotiations of the two remaining major U.S. copperproducers, whose contracts end on June 30, and the low levelof world supplies.                                                                                                          COCOA: Futures prices eased. The July contract ended down$25 a metric ton at $1,415. Prices swung over a wide range,dropping in early trading to as low as $1,383 then recoveringto as high as $1,425 before easing toward the close. JudithGanes, analyst for Merrill Lynch, noted that the politicalturmoil in the Ivory Coast, the world's leading cocoaproducer, helped boost prices in recent weeks -- butmeanwhile exports from that country moved at an uninterruptedpace and have continued to climb. But now that dock strikespossibly may begin today in the Ivory Coast and Brazil, alsoa major cocoa-bean grower, prices fell yesterday. &quot;It seemsstrange that factors which had nothing really to do withcocoa pushed prices higher, but now that there aredevelopments that directly relate to cocoa, prices fall.&quot; shesaid. &quot;It may be a case of buy the rumor, sell the fact.&quot; Shesaid a report circulated early in the day that a French tradehouse had rejected a Soviet request for extension of creditin connection with a quantity of cocoa beans the firm hasbought for the Soviet Union. &quot;Now the speculation is whetherthose beans might be sold on the world market,&quot; she said.&quot;The development might have contributed to the early drop inthe futures prices, but it wasn't a major factor.&quot;                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices of hog futures contractsplunged in volatile trading on speculation that the slaughterwill temporarily jump next week, said Charles Levitt, ananalyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, Chicago. A spate of dryweather in the Midwest is allowing many farmers to plantcrops delayed by unusually heavy rains this spring. Busy inthe fields, many farmers won't have time to bring their hogsto market this week, so a glut might suddenly develop whenthey do. Hog prices were vulnerable to a profit-takingplunge, because they have been closing in on record highlevels. However, many analysts think that hog prices willremain high this summer. Hog prices have been strong forseveral months because of a tight supply of hogs ready forslaughter. That is because many farmers were cautious aboutexpanding their herds last year. Because of tight supplies,the hog slaughter is slipping instead of rising as it usuallydoes in the spring. Last week, the number of hogs killed atfederally inspected meat-packing plants dropped 6% from ayear earlier, said Thomas Morgan, president of SterlingResearch Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. The competition amongmeatpackers to find hogs to kill has increased the price offattened hogs to 66 cents a pound in some Midwest markets,just one cent below the record high. What might help keep hogprices in check this summer is that the supply of alternativemeats, such as beef, is expected to rise. Prices of cattlefutures contracts settled mixed.</TEXT></DOC>
