She also contends Davis is asking to acquire aright not normally given to a man _ the decision on whether a childshould be born after he has fertilized the egg of his mate.</TEXT><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's health officials are scrambling tocontain a 370 percent rise in the number of measles cases afteryears in which the old childhood nemesis virtually disappeared as apublic health problem.   More than 8,400 people have caught measles so far in 1989, andas many as 25 have died, according to the national Centers forDisease Control in Atlanta.   ``It's not really clear why. It's probably a variety ofthings,'' said Dr. William Atkinson of the CDC.   Lack of immunizations is playing a big part, especially in innercity Hispanic and black neighborhoods, where many youngsters aregoing without the measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations they shouldreceive starting at 15 months of age.   ``We have to reach the parents and really convince them of theimportance of having the child vaccinated,'' Atkinson saidWednesday. ``There are publicly funded clinics where children canreceive vaccines for little or no cost.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gen.
