(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Titan 2 rocket thatonce sat in a silo armed with a nuclear warhead was launched intospace Monday, carrying a secret Air Force payload believed to befour spy satellites designed to eavesdrop on Soviet ships.   The launch marked the first time one of the refurbished missileshad been used as a space booster, and apparently was the secondtime U.S. spy satellites had been sent into orbit in less than aweek.   ``It was a spectacular launch with all systems operating asexpected,'' said Air Force Capt. Norma Payne.   But the spokeswoman added that officials would not know for twoto three days whether the classified payload achieved its intendedpolar orbit circling the Earth from North to South poles.   The rocket almost certainly carried a four-satellite addition tothe Navy's White Cloud Navy Ocean Surveillance System, anelectronic eavesdropping system that locates and identifies Sovietand other ships by detecting radio and radar transmissions, spacepolicy analyst John Pike said before the launch.   ``The Navy really likes them,'' said Pike, of theWashington-based Federation of American Scientists. ``They are veryimportant for being able to keep track of the Soviet fleet.''   Pike said a White Cloud launch ``consists of one mothersatellite and three subsatellites,'' and that when orbit isreached, the mother satellite deploys the other three spacecraft soall four are strung out a few hundred miles from each other inpolar orbit.   The $37.5 million Titan 2 roared off Space Launch Complex 4 Westand into fog-shrouded skies at 2:25 a.m. PDT, Ms. Payne said atthis sprawling military base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.   The force of the blast-off rattled windows in the nearby town ofLompoc, where police said they received a half-dozen calls fromresidents asking whether it was an earthquake or a launch.   The liquid-fueled, two-stage rocket is 103 feet high and capableof lifting 4,200 pounds into a 100-nautical-mile circular orbit.   Starting in the 1960s, Titan 2 rockets were kept in silos inArkansas, Kansas and Arizona, where they served as intercontinentalballistic missiles, each carrying a nine-megaton hydrogen warhead.   But the missiles were removed from service ``because thepropellants were corroding the innards of the missile and they hada tendency to blow up,'' Pike said.   The Air Force then ordered 13 Titan 2s reconditioned as spaceboosters under a $528.9 million contract with Martin Marietta Corp.Air Force officials have said more are likely to be refurbishedbecause recycling the old ICBMs is cheaper than building newrockets.   Last Friday, a satellite said to be designed for interceptingSoviet communications was launched by a $65 million Titan 34Drocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla. But a source close to the project,who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the spacecraft failed toachieve its desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when theupper stage of the rocket failed to re-ignite. He said there waslittle hope of salvaging that mission.   Despite that failure, Air Force Secretary Edward C. ``Pete''Aldridge issued a prepared statement after Monday's launch,declaring, ``This is the year of space launch recovery.''   ``Today's successful Titan 2 launch is the first of three newboosters the Air Force will launch in the coming year,'' Aldridgesaid. ``The Titan 2, Titan 4 and the Delta 2 ... will ensure thisnation's access to space for many years to come.''   The launch had been expected a week earlier, but apparently wasdelayed by a fuel leak that the Air Force said spurred evacuationof the launch pad Aug. 28. No one was hurt in that incident,officials said.   Pike said the only other payload the Titan 2 might boost intoorbit from Vandenberg was a Defense Meteorological Support Programsatellite. But he called that unlikely.   A Titan 2 exploded in its Arkansas silo on Sept. 19, 1980,killing one crewman, injuring 21 others, blasting a 250-foot-widecrater and lofting the nine-megaton warhead harmlessly 200 feetfrom the silo. Fuel leaks and vapor spurts that prompted brief siloevacuations also plagued Titan 2 ICBMs, which since have beenreplaced by Minuteman, Midgetman and MX missiles.   Pike said Air Force officials have testified before Congressthat the first 13 reconditioned Titan 2s would be used for onelaunch of a LANDSAT Earth-observing science satellite, six launchesof DMSP weather satellites and six launches of satellites in aclassified program.   Four or five sets of White Clouds _ about 16 to 20 satellites _already are in orbit, with the new set likely meant to replaceaging White Clouds launched in the early 1980s, he said.   Pike compared White Clouds to Soviet RORSATs, or Radar OceanReconaissance Satellites, which monitor U.S. ship movements.</TEXT></DOC>
