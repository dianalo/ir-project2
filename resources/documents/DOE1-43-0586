Electrons and positronswere detected. The product of solid angles of the set-up is 1.48 sr/sup2/. Processing yielded {similar_to}160 events of the IEP reaction. Theexperimental value of the cross section for the IEP reaction on the carbonnucleus was {Delta}{sigma}(/sup 12/C)=(27.6+-4.7)x10/sup -33/ cm /sup2/ if the electron and positron energies exceed 60 MeV, and their emissionangles are {Theta} {similar_to} 90 deg in the lab system. Hence the followingvalue is obtained for the differential cross section of the IEP processon a proton ({pi}/sup -/p -andgt; e/sup +/e/sup -/n) under the same conditions:d/sup 2/{delta}/d{Omega}/sup 2/(p)=(5.3+-1.1)x10/sup -33/ cm/sup 2//sr/sup2/, taking into account screening of protons. The Dirac isovector formfactor on the nucleon is found to be F/sub 1//sup V/=1.15+-0.09 for thesquared four-momentum of the photon K/sup 2/=0.055 (GeV/c)/sup 2/. 17refs.; 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
