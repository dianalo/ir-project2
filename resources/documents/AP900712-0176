Former President Daniel Ortega called the settlement a victoryfor the Sandinistas that preserved a basic ``conquest of therevolution'' _ land reform.   A Sandinista strike in May ended with a 100 percent pay raise.   Businesses opened Thursday in Managua and workers began toreplace street paving stones torn up to build barricades.   Six people were killed and 100 wounded in clashes betweenstrikers and government supporters during the 10-day strike thattested the stability of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro andher government, which replaced Ortega's government on April 25.   The government met many Sandinista demands: salary increases,compensation for fired government workers, suspension of a decreeto return Sandinista-confiscated land to its original owners, andrestoration of free public transportation for students.   Unions also appeared to have made headway in their demand for arole in running the economy in this country of 3.7 millionresidents.   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Bouchersaid the administration was pleased the strikes had ended.   But he assailed Sandinista authorities, saying they have beenunwilling to grant the government the breathing spell it needs toget desperately needed economic reconstruction under way.   Ortega denied the strike was a Sandinista attempt to underminethe government and said senior party leaders played a pivotal rolein settling it.   He praised the Sandinista armed forces, which his brother heads,and the Sandinista police for avoiding confrontation.   The Superior Council of Private Enterprise, the major businessgroup here, said the strike amounted to blackmail and accused thegovernment of caving in under pressure. Council President GilbertoCuadra said the accord crippled the government program to returnNicaragua to a free market economy.   The strike hit at planting time and involved thousands ofagricultural workers. Cuadra said it will cost Nicaragua from $35million to $50 million.   Presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo defended the settlement onstate radio. He said it prevented more bloodshed and assuredstability.   Employees at the Industry and Commerce Ministry jumped up anddown and hugged each other in celebration when the end of thestrike was announced.   The strike began July 2 and grew into the biggest challenge toMrs. Chamorro since the Sandinistas were voted out of office 10weeks ago after nine years in power. The Sandinistas had said sincelosing elections to her United National Opposition coalition thatthey would ``rule from below.''   Unions claimed 90,000 government and state industry employeesjoined the walkout. It was the second time the Sandinistas broughtpublic services to a halt to force pay raises and modifications inMrs. Chamorro's plans to cut public spending, sell off state-ownedenterprises and turn into a capitalist economy thesocialist-oriented economy built by the Sandinistas.   Traffic stareted returning to normal Thursday, but cars andtrucks had to creep around potholes, dislodged paving stones andrubble left behind from the barricades and fires that filled thestreets during three days of disturbances.   The unions called off street disruptions Wednesday to persuadethe government to negotiate, but intense gunfire could be heard inthe city through the night. No casualties were reported.   Army and city cleanup crews used heavy equipment to shovel awayremaining barricades. Others fit paving stones back into place.   The government had declared the strike ``illegal, illegitimateand non-existent'' and threatened to fire those who took part. Mostgovernment employees received their positions during Sandinistarule.   The agreement with the pro-Sandinista National Workers' Frontgrants a 43 percent raise this month and another increase inAugust. The amount of the second raise is to be later determined.   The agreement specifies that 800 employees fired after April 26will receive compensation, state jobs will be reclassified inSeptember and a new minimum wage law will be established.   The strikers forced the conservative government to back down ona key part of its plan to return Nicaragua, debilitated by theReagan administration's economic embargo, to a free-market economy:the return of lands confiscated in the 1979 revolution.   Workers and students are to once again ride publictransportation for free, a privilege granted by the Sandinistas andrecently suspended by the new government to save money.   The government agreed to create a commission of government andNational Workers' Front representatives to discuss governmentinvestment in state-owned texile, metalworking and constructioncompanies. The talks are to begin Monday.   Creation of the commission appeared to be a response to theFront's demand for a role in making economic policy.</TEXT></DOC>
