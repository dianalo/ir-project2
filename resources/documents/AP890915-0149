Michael S. Dukakis said Friday he hasn't reada book about his 1988 presidential run that says he retreated into``a two-month shell'' after a flap that rocked his campaign inSeptember 1987.   The incident that forced the resignation of campaign manager JohnSasso, a close friend and adviser to Dukakis, was described in ``Allby Myself,'' a book written by Boston Globe reporters Christine M.Black and Thomas Oliphant.   ``He missed Sasso personally and politically, and worried abouthim,'' they wrote of the Democratic candidate, and said he became``flat as a pancake out on the hustings.''   ``Dukakis' glum mood was also reflected in an almost petulantunwillingness to try new material in his speeches,'' according tothe account.   ``I haven't read it. I think it's clear we did a good job winningthe nomination and not as good a job winning the final. There's nosense crying over spilt milk,'' Dukakis said in a brief interviewduring an international trade conference at the Statehouse.   He said he is concentrating on his responsibilities as governor,and not rehashing the campaign.   ``I spent most of yesterday preparing for the education summit,''Dukakis said, referring to the meeting later this month of thenation's governors and President Bush, the Republican who defeatedhim.   The book quoted Susan Estrich, who replaced Sasso as campaignmanager, as saying Dukakis would ``return from the road convincedthat no one liked him.'' Estrich was described as ``bothered by hismopey moods,'' while campaign chairman Paul Brountas said thecandidate entered ``a two-month shell.''   Sasso was forced to resign in September 1987 after it wasdisclosed that he had secretly distributed a videotape showing thatSen. Joseph Biden Jr. of Delaware, a Dukakis rival for theDemocratic nomination, was appropriating as his own campaignspeeches made by British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.   Sasso acted without the knowledge of Dukakis, who publicly deniedhis campaign had any role in providing the videotape.   The account also described how Dukakis repeatedly rejectedappeals from campaign aides to go on the attack against Bush. Thebook outlined an advertising effort that at one point produced 1,200unused scripts for commercials.   Although he once had a double-digit lead over Bush in the polls,Dukakis found himself trailing after the Republican NationalConvention in August 1988.   It wasn't until the closing days of the campaign that Dukakiswent on the attack, using the populist theme, ``I'm on your side.''He closed the gap somewhat but on election day, Bush carried 40states.</TEXT></DOC>
