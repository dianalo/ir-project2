The agreement removes a major uncertainty about whetherRio Algom would have been forced to close its Ontario uraniummine at the end of 1993, when Ontario Hydro had the option tocancel the original contract.</LP><TEXT>   The provincially owned utility, which has been payingabove market price for Ontario-mined uranium for years,recently canceled a similar contract as of the end of 1992with Denison Mines Ltd. Both Denison and Rio Algom have highproduction costs because of the low grade of their ore.   Under terms of Rio Algom's amended contract, the companysaid it lowered the price of its uranium sold to OntarioHydro. But because the amount delivered will risesignificantly, Rio said its revenue and earnings will remainroughly the same.   Rio Algom, a Toronto-based mining concern, is scheduled todeliver 9.6 million pounds of uranium to Ontario Hydrobetween Jan. 1 of this year and the middle of 1996, when thecontract expires. The original contract was due to run until2020 and called for Rio Algom to supply about 3.6 millionpounds before 1996.   &quot;Anything that was given away in price was made up inpounds&quot; of uranium, a Rio Algom spokesman said. &quot;It gives usmore time to seek out other contracts and to let the worlduranium markets recover.&quot;   Uranium, which traded above 40 U.S. dollars a pound in thelate 1970s, has slumped to below $10 a pound in recentmonths. Rio Algom won't disclose how much it gets for itsuranium, but analysts estimate Ontario Hydro previously waspaying about $35 a pound.   Officials at the utility couldn't be reached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
