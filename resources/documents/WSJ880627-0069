The Thursday night incident, the first involving one of the secret MH-6 copters in the gulf, occurred during a routine patrol and did not involve any hostile fire, officials said.    Both crewmen escaped injury and were picked up later in good condition, the Pentagon said. The helicopter sank.    Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman, said the incident occurred shortly before midnight local time, or around 4 p.m. EDT Thursday. He identified the craft only as &quot;a U.S. helicopter operating in the central Persian Gulf on a routine surveillance mission.&quot;    But other officials, who asked not to be identified, said the helicopter was an MH-6 flying from one of two large barges moored in the northern Persian Gulf.    The barges are used to support minesweeping vessels as well as a number of special operations aircraft and commando teams, and also as bases for surveillance missions to keep track of Iranian gunboats. The Navy and Defense Department officially refuse to acknowledge their existence.    The MH-6 is a small, fast reconnaissance aircraft that has been armed with several sophisticated weapons and nighttime sensors and modified to fly with little noise. A derivative of a bubble-canopy copter designed by Hughes Aircraft Co., a General Motors Corp. unit, it is thought to be flown by only one unit of the Army's Special Operations Forces, based at Fort Campbell, Ky.    The helicopters were ferried to the gulf last summer, not long after the U.S. Navy began protecting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the gulf. Kuwait, a key ally of Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war, requested the protection after Iran began singling out the vessels for attack.    Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger acknowledged the helicopters' presence in the gulf after one of them intercepted and attacked an Iranian navy ship, the Iran Ajr, as it sowed mines in international waters of the gulf last Sept. 21. Pentagon sources said Friday they were certain an effort would be made to raise the downed helicopter, &quot;depending upon the depth of the water there.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
