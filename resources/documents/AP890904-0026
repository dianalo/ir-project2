On Sunday, $65 million worth of U.S. military equipment and otheraid, accompanied by up to 100 American military trainers, beganarriving in Colombia.   Sununu said the United States was providing the aid at therequest of Colombian President Virgilio Barco, and ``the constraintson the folks and the resources that go down there are based on whatPresident Barco would like them to do.''   Sununu was asked: ``Is the president willing to risk Americanservicemen in this war on drugs?''   The White House official replied: ``Well, if that request evercame in, I'm sure the president would recognize that the Americanpublic thinks that the drug problem is so tough and so importantthat there is a great feeling amongst American citizens that weprobably should take even that risk.''   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, interviewed on ABC's ``This WeekWith David Brinkley,'' also said American personnel in Colombiawould be at some risk.   ``I can't say with absolute certainty that there is no risk toour people in Colombia,'' he said. ``There's probably risk to ourembassy employees there. The dependents are coming out because ofthat. To the maximum extent possible we want to minimize the risk.The Colombian security forces will provide security for our people.''   The Pentagon chief said, ``At this point, no Latin Americancountry has requested, nor has the president indicated any desire,to send American troops into combat in Latin America to deal withthe drug problem.''   In the current Colombia operation, he said, ``We are not sendingour folks into combat. They are not going out, for example, withunits of the Colombian military to actually attack facilities of thecartel. They're going to be flying missions into Colombia, but notwithin Colombia itself.''   But Cheney added: ``I can't guarantee that it's absolutelyrisk-free. The possibility exists that they would become targets forthe cartel. There is some risk involved. They (U.S. personnel) willbe able to defend themselves.''   The American aid being sent to Colombia includes two C-130transport planes and eight twin-engine A-37 jet aircraft, as well asweapons, ammunition and communications gear.</TEXT></DOC>
