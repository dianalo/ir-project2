The shuttle now is scheduled for launch sometime between July 15 and Aug. 15, NASA officials said. There had been speculation that NASA wouldn't launch the shuttle during an election year, particularly around the time of the Republican National Convention, which begins Aug. 15. But NASA Administrator James Fletcher vowed that the launch schedule won't be affected by politics.    &quot;The White House wouldn't ask us to change the launch date,&quot; Mr. Fletcher said. The White House &quot;made it very clear to me that we launch when we're ready, and don't mess around with any political considerations.&quot;    While a successful launch could be of some benefit to the Republicans, the harm from a failure would be much greater; moreover, a launch could distract the public from the convention.    In any event, some members of Congress were skeptical that NASA could meet its revised schedule. Rep. Robert Walker (R., Pa.), a member of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said he doesn't expect a launch until September. &quot;I just have to believe there will be a couple of weeks of slippage,&quot; he said.    The new launch date, which is earlier than some critics had expected, reflects the conflicting pressures on NASA to resume the shuttle program, but cautiously enough to assure safety. During a December test firing of the rocket booster, a portion of the rocket nozzle broke off. Rather than completely redesign the part, NASA said it will use a replacement part, which it had tested previously.    The part, called the outer boot ring, anchors a heat shield that protects a bearing that lets the rocket's nozzle swivel. The nozzles are crucial because their movement steers the rocket during takeoff.    NASA said it will now use a design for the boot ring that it tested last August, but under less stress than the boot ring that failed in December. J.R. Thompson, director of the Marshall Space Flight Center, in Huntsville, Ala., said the replacement part would be retested during a test firing in late March and two later trials.    However, he said, the tests will occur after Morton Thiokol Inc. has shipped to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida the rocket booster segments that will be used in the launch. So if the replacement part fails its tests, the space shuttle schedule could go completely awry. Booster parts might have to be disassembled and perhaps shipped back to Morton Thiokol's Utah facilities.    &quot;If we didn't ship any flight hardware to the Cape until the test program was over, we wouldn't be taking any risk,&quot; said Richard Truly, NASA's associate administrator for space flight. &quot;But we would delay the launch of the space shuttle until some time in 1989 or later.&quot;    The disruption in shuttle flights has cost NASA dearly in terms of its credibility and exploration plans. The shuttle is necessary for the military to launch reconnaissance satellites, build a space-based missile-defense system, and for NASA to transport parts of its proposed orbiting space station.    Since the grounding of the shuttle, the government has been pushing private companies to move into the satellite-launch business, using unmanned rockets. French, Chinese and Soviet agencies also have been competing to launch cargo that would have gone on the shuttle.    The shuttle program has been stalled since the Challenger exploded Jan. 28, 1986, 74 seconds after liftoff, killing its seven crew members. The disaster was followed closely by launch failures of NASA and Air Force unmanned rockets, crippling the nation's ability to launch satellites and conduct experiments in space. </TEXT></DOC>
