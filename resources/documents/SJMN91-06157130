And they say they've got the blessing of at least two more oftheir fellow jurors.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  JURORS IN NEEDLE-EXCHANGE CASE TAKE UP THECAUSE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Members of the jury that voted 11-1 in April to acquit two anti-AIDSactivists charged with possession of hypodermic needles this week pressedstate officials to legalize needle exchanges to prevent the spread of the AIDSvirus.;    In the meantime, the foreman of the jury breaks the law himself,giving drug addicts clean needles in exchange for their dirty ones.;    &quot;Sure,you'd like people not to use drugs. But if they're going to, give 'em cleanneedles,&quot; said former juror Madonna Foley, 63.;    The trial produced a nearlyreligious conversion among some members of the jury, which represented a crosssection of San Mateo County residents. Most had thought of AIDS as anexclusively homosexual disease that didn't affect them. Now, they feel anobligation to spread the knowledge they have gained.;    Even Foley's husband,Jim, became a convert after sitting in the courtroom through the six-daytrial.;    &quot;Before that I thought, 'It's not my problem,' &quot; said Foley, 68, aretired labor foreman. &quot;I'm a straight guy. I've been married 43 years. I'veonly got the one woman. Then I thought about my great-grandson. When he growsup, he's going to ask, 'What did Grandma and Grandpa do when all this wasgoing on?' On certain things, you gotta bend the law.&quot;;    On Monday, theFoleys and former jury foreman Spero Saridakis met in Sacramento withAssistant Secretary of Health and Welfare Margaret DeBow and Wayne Sauseda,chief of the state's Office of AIDS, to advocate a pilot needle exchangeprogram. Similar proposals have been blocked by legislators who claim thateasier access to syringes will encourage drug abuse.;    &quot;I was a little takenaback,&quot; DeBow said after the 90-minute meeting. &quot;I would have thought that arandomly selected panel of jurors might come down on the other side of theissue.&quot;;    So did Deputy District Attorney John Oakes, who broughtmisdemeanor charges against Joey Tranchina and Camille Anacabe after the twowere arrested outside a Redwood City methadone clinic last Septemberexchanging dirty needles for clean ones.;    Oakes' case crumbled after thejudge granted permission for defense attorneys to argue that the paircommitted the crime to prevent an imminent and greater danger. Health expertstestified that needle exchanges have proven effective in AIDS preventionefforts in other states and in Europe.;    Intravenous drug users with AIDSare a major source of infection among heterosexuals and their numbers continueto rise rapidly. As of the end of April, the Office of AIDS reported 1,779AIDS cases among heterosexual drug users and 2,923 among homosexual orbisexual drug users, 14 percent of California's 33,700 AIDS cases.;    &quot;Mostof us were repulsed by the idea of even being around someone who is a druguser because they're in a high-risk group,&quot; said Saridakis, a 33-year-oldmechanic with United Airlines. &quot;But in the long run, the risk would be greaterif we did nothing.&quot;;    For Madonna Foley, who has four children, fivegrandchildren and a one-year-old great-grandson, the reasoning is evensimpler.;    &quot;As I always said, you do everything in your power to prevent alife from being lost,&quot; she said.;    The Foleys are not willing to risk arrestthemselves, but plan to join Saridakis and two other jurors at needle exchangesites in San Francisco this week.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID BANK, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910605  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  603  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday June 5, 199100157130,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
