Armed forces radio and the Itim news agency reported theguerrillas had planned to stage an attack inside Israel.   An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he didnot know whether they planned an attack, but he said they carriedwire cutters, indicating they might have planned to sneak throughthe border fence.   A South Lebanon Army patrol spotted the guerrilla squad about amile north of the village of Al Jibbayn in Israel's self-declaredsecurity zone in southern Lebanon, the official said, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   The patrol opened fire, killing the guerrillas, he said. Fightersof the South Lebanon Army did not suffer casualties.   Documents found on the guerillas' bodies showed they were membersof Naif Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,a Marxist faction of the PLO, the official said.   The guerrillas carried three Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifles,a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and grenades, the army officialsaid.   On Wednesday, the Hawatmeh faction celebrated its 20thanniversary, and underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising inthe occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip urged Palestinians to mark itwith a ``day of confrontations.''   Today's clash was the second involving a PLO faction sinceDecember, when the Palestine Liberation Organization chief, YasserArafat, renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.   On Feb. 5, Israeli troops killed five guerrillas on the northernborder of security zone, and the army said the squad planned anattack in Israel. Three of the guerrillas were from the PopularFront for the Liberation of Palestine.   The South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian militiafinanced and trained by Israel, assists 1,000 Israeli troops inpatrolling the security zone. Israel declared the six-to-10 milestrip in 1985 after withdrawing most of its troops from Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
