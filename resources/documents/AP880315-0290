DRISCOLL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Precious metals futures moved higher Tuesday, with gold pricesapproaching recent highs.   While there was little on the world financial or political sceneto account for the strength, the move put gold in a position tobreak out of its trading range, analysts said.   On other markets, pork belly futures took a nosedive, grains andsoybeans were mixed and crude oil was a little higher.   ``The price action of gold was very good, but it came out ofleft field,'' said Craig Sloane, an analyst in New York with SmithBarney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. ``There wasn't any real news; no actionin the other markets that would warrant it.''   However, he noted that the gold contract for delivery in Aprilreached a high of $448.30 an ounce at the New York CommodityExchange.   ``This is very close to the highs that were made during a recentconsolidation phase were it traded between $440 and $450,'' hesaid. Prices had dropped into the mid $420s last month.   Sloane said prices are not likely to break beyond $450 onWednesday, one day ahead of the release of the January balance oftrade data.   ``But whenever it gets this close to the top of the range, youhave to treat it with some respect,'' he said.   ``Metals have made a nice recovery from the lows of a few weeksago,'' said Sloane. ``They're well positioned to make a nice move.If we do get favorable trade data, prices have almost no where togo but to break out.''   Gold settled $4.40 to $5.10 higher with the contract fordelivery in April at $447.50 a troy ounce; and silver was 12.5cents higher with March at $6.365 a troy ounce.   Pork belly futures retreated sharply at the Chicago MercantileExchange under data indicating there may be burdensome supplies inthe summer.   ``Bellies collapsed late in the day following a report of a bigmovement into storage,'' said Philip Stanley, an anlayst in Chicagowith Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.   He said 3.7 million pounds of pork bellies were stored duringthe week ended March 12.   ``This was at the top end of expectations,'' said Stanley.   Prices could rebound if the market comes to believe there'sgoing to be a need for a lot of bellies, he said, but right nowit's concerned about the ramifications for an oversupply later thissummer.   Cattle futures were weakened by profit taking, said Stanley.   Live cattle settled .18 cent lower to .10 cent higher with theApril contract at 73.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 centlower to .32 cent higher with March at 82.72 cents a pound; livehogs were unchanged to .40 cent lower with April at 45.20 cents apound; and frozen pork bellies were .95 cent to 1.32 cents lowerwith March at 52.62 cents a pound.   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed on the Chicago Boardof Trade.   It was a sluggish session with little price movement in eitherdirection.   ``This is the reflection of the indecisiveness of the markettoday in these slow conditions,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a traderwith Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``There was no news overnight tomove prices either way.   Wheat was \ cent lower to 1 cent higher with the contract fordelivery in March settling at $2.95 a bushel; corn was \ cent lowerto } cent higher with March at $1.98 a bushel; oats were 1{ centsto 3\ cents lower with March at $1.88{ a bushel; and soybeans were1 cent lower to { cent higher with March at $6.13} a bushel.   Crude oil futures moved a little higher, but the market remainedconfused and cautious, said Peter Beutel, an analyst in New Yorkwith Elders Futures Inc.   ``People are waiting for OPEC to say `We've got a problem,' anddeal with it, or for prices to simply go lower,'' he said.   At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediatecrude oil was 9 cents higher with the April contract at $15.68 abarrel; heating oil was .06 cent lower to .13 cent higher withApril at 43.47 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .05 centlower to .02 cent higher with April at 44.38 cents a gallon.</TEXT></DOC>
