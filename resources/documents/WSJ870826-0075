San Francisco Federal, with assets of $2.8 billion, said that under the agreement, Capital Federal holders will receive $21 worth of San Francisco Federal stock in exchange for each share of Capital Federal they hold.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Capital Federal rose $2.25 to close at $17.75 a share. San Francisco Federal closed at $20 a share, down 25 cents in national over-the-counter trading.    The agreement calls for the San Francisco thrift to acquire all 1.7 million shares outstanding of Capital Federal, which is based in Sacramento, Calif. San Francisco Federal plans to issue between 1.6 million and 2 million newly authorized shares. Currently, San Francisco Federal has 5.6 million shares outstanding.    The exchange ratio will be set between 0.9655 share and 1.2174 shares of the San Francisco thrift for each share of Capital Federal, depending on the average price of San Francisco Federal for the 30 days preceding regulatory approval of the acquisition.    The acquisition could be completed in the first quarter of 1988, subject to approval by shareholders of both companies, San Francisco Federal said. Patrick Price, San Francisco Federal's president and chief executive officer, said the acquisition follows the thrift's strategy to expand into nearby California markets through the purchase of &quot;sound,&quot; profitable institutions.    In 1986, San Francisco Federal had a profit of $22.1 million, up slightly from $22 million a year earlier. Capital Federal, in the fiscal year ended June 30, had net income of $3.7 million, up 28% from $2.9 million a year earlier.    San Francisco Federal operates 26 branches in the San Francisco Bay area. Capital Federal, with assets of $985 million, has 23 Sacramento-area branches. </TEXT></DOC>
