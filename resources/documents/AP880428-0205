To bolster international efforts to save endangered Africanelephants, other countries are being asked to take similar actionagainst a Burundi stockpile of ivory believed harvested by poachersin other countries, said spokesman David Klinger.   Burundi is a Maryland-sized central African nation without wildelephants of its own. Although ivory shipments from Burundi inviolation of treaties could not be accepted by the United States,without Thursday's action there would be no legal bar toimportation of carved or otherwise worked items made in thirdcountries from ivory shipped from Burundi.   Swiss-based officials of the Convention on the InternationalTrade in Endangered Species and others sources have confirmed thatabout 16,000 tusks or 94 tons of ivory have accumulated underprivate ownership in Burundi, Klinger said.   The ivory was accumulated before Burundi last November bannedimports outside of the convention, and officials there say theyhave no legal way to prevent export of the material.   ``We don't want this ivory in international trade,'' saidKlinger. ``Because Burundi has no wild elephants and noivory-producing country has authorized exports to Burundi since thecontrol system began in December 1986, Fish and Wildlife Servicelaw enforcement officials believe this stockpile was obtainedillegally.''   Burundi is not one of the 95 nations that have signed theconvention and has been used as a shipping point by people tryingto get around quotas on ivory from elephants killed in othercountries, said Klinger.   The neighbors of Burundi _ Zaire, Rwanda and Tanzania _ do haveelephants, which have been severely threatened by poaching and lossof habitat. From an estimated 1.5 million animals 10 years ago, thepopulation has fallen to about 760,000.   For this reason, nations with elephants have agreed on quotasfor ivory shipments, and a registration and tracking system fortusks taken according to the quotas. Burundi cooperates in thequota system and banned non-treaty imports of ivory last November,but says it has no legal way to act against ivory imported beforethat.   When registration began on Dec. 1, 1986, 18,148 tusks totaling98.6 tons were listed by Burundi. Such previously accumulatedinventories were exempt and could be sold, and the tusks went tocarvers in Hong Kong.   The current stockpile is not registered with the convention.   About 770 to 900 tons of ivory are traded every year. Tusks areworth about $50 million and carved items $500 million or more,Klinger said.</TEXT></DOC>
