The discrepancy between estimates of EPO obtained withtwo radioimmunoassays (RIAs) differing only in time of incubation with{sup 125}I-labeled recombinant human EPO (r-HuEPO) (20 h and 72 h) hasbeen used as an indicator of tracer degradation occurring during theRIA incubation. Degradation of {sup 125}I-labeled r-HuEPO by male mouseSG extracts was not prevented by addition of inhibitors of monodeiodinasesor proteolytic enzymes. Degradation of added {sup 125}I-labeled r-HuEPOwas monitored using gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography.SG extracts from male and androgen-treated female mice both degradedtracer r-HuEPO to a greater extent than extracts from female mice. Tracerdegradation increased with time and tissue concentration and could giverise to invalid estimates of EPO in SG extracts by RIA. In contrast,none of the kidney extracts degraded r-HuEPO. Recovery of mouse serumEPO added to and incubated with male mouse SG or kidney extracts was13% and 93%, respectively, estimated by RIA under conditions that excludeddegradation of the RIA tracer antigen.</TEXT></DOC>
