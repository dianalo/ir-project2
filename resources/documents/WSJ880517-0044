Nerco is a mining and resource-development concern that is 90%-owned by PacifiCorp, a utility holding company based here. The tentative pact is subject, among other things, to approval by the federal bankruptcy court charged with overseeing Dallas-based Placid's Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings, Nerco said.    Placid -- owned by trusts of Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert Hunt and Lamar Hunt, three sons of the late H.L. Hunt -- is selling the Black Lake holding, among other assets, to repay some of its more than $800 million in bank debt and allow the company to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings this summer. The holding, discovered by H.L. Hunt in 1964, is considered one of Placid's major U.S. assets.    Nerco said Placid's daily production in the Black Lake field is about 75 million cubic feet of natural gas and 2,400 barrels of oil and petrochemical liquids. The holding has estimated net proven reserves of about 122 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 2.2 million barrels of oil and other liquids, a spokesman added.    Nerco spent about $65 million last year to acquire oil and gas holdings, mainly in Louisiana. The company said the Placid holding would nearly triple Nerco's gas reserves and quadruple daily gas production.    The proposed transaction also includes Placid's natural gas pipeline from Louisiana to Texas, a natural gas processing plant, a carbon dioxide pipeline and other facilities. </TEXT></DOC>
