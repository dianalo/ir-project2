Industry officials and analysts say the talks, which cover 60% of Alcan's Canadian smelting capacity and about 5% of total free-world capacity, also may have a big impact on the spot aluminum price. Yesterday, the price closed at the equivalent of 84.1 cents on the London Metal Exchange, up 64% from a low of 51.4 cents in January.    Robert Maloney, a metals analyst at Wood Gundy Corp., New York, said he believes the threat of a strike at Alcan is a major factor in maintaining the current high aluminum price. If a strike doesn't materialize, &quot;I think the price would drop out of bed,&quot; he said. &quot;With a settlement at Alcan, I think the price will be back in the 60s by the end of the year.&quot;    While other analysts dispute the size of Mr. Maloney's forecast drop in the aluminum price in case of a settlement, there is general agreement that the talks, which began in June, are a factor in the heated aluminum market.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Alcan shares closed at $38, up 37.5 cents.    The contract with the Federation des Syndicats du Secteur Aluminium, the independent union, which represents employees at three of Alcan's Quebec smelters, expires Aug. 31. The union mainly is seeking bans on subcontracting and on overtime, with the aim of creating more union jobs. An Alcan spokesman wouldn't comment on the union's demands, but said the giant aluminum producer is optimistic about a settlement.    &quot;I can't say (the talks) are 10% of the reason or 50% of the reason,&quot; for high aluminum prices, said Charles Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smith, New York. But he said there are indications that consumers are building inventories, either out of fear of a strike at Alcan, or in anticipation of still higher aluminum prices.    Other factors cited in the recent price rise include heavy purchases of aluminum ingot by Japanese buyers and speculative trading in aluminum on commodity markets.    Stewart Spector, publisher of the Spector Report on the aluminum industry, contends, however, that the Alcan labor situation has &quot;limited bearing&quot; on pricing. He said the higher price is the result of a world shortage of aluminum resulting from a rebuilding of inventories from historically low levels coupled with a moderate increase in demand. He said aluminum prices &quot;would do very little&quot; if a contract were reached without a strike.    The talks at Alcan's Canadian smelting unit involve four of Alcan's five Quebec smelters with a total capacity of 636,000 metric tons a year. Alcan's smelter at Grande Baie, Quebec, is non-union and its Kitimat, British Columbia smelter is represented by another union whose contract expires in 1988.    Neither Alcan, nor the Federation des Syndicats du Secteur Aluminium expects a settlement by the contract's expiration date. The contract at the fourth smelter, represented by another union, expires on the same date.    &quot;We're confident we're going to get a contract, but not before Aug. 31,&quot; said an Alcan spokesman.    Levis Desgagne, the federation's president, said he would like to complete the talks before the end of October, but said &quot;at the rate we're going, I'm not optimistic.&quot; In Canada, unions frequently continue to work after the contract expires. In 1984, the same Alcan union came to a contract agreement, without a strike, eight months after the expiry of the old pact.    Mr. Desgagne said it is too soon to predict whether there will be a strike or not, but he said his union is intent on using the current strong market for aluminum to make gains in the contract talks. &quot;It's this year or never,&quot; he added.    In the past three years, Mr. Desgagne said the union has lost 1,000 jobs because of cutbacks. At least 500 more jobs are expected to be lost when Alcan builds a proposed smelter at Laterriere, Quebec, replacing existing capacity at the nearby Jonquiere smelter.    In addition to seeking bans on subcontracting and overtime, in an attempt to create more union jobs, the union also is seeking a cost-of-living increase of about 4% annually plus another 1% to 2% in a two-year contract. Alcan wants a three-year pact but hasn't disclosed its wage offer. The current average wage is 16.65 Canadian dollars ($12.53) an hour.    For aluminum users, the Alcan negotiations just add uncertainty to an already volatile market. Robert Wool, vice president metals at Cressona Aluminum Co., an aluminum extrusion concern based in Cressona, Pa., said his company hasn't built inventories despite the fact that Alcan is its largest supplier of ingot or primary aluminum.    &quot;Our inventory is probably at the lowest levels of 1987,&quot; noted Mr. Wool, who said he has been reluctant to build inventories at current high prices. He said he isn't expecting a strike at Alcan, but is hoping that Alcan would try to continue operating with management personnel if the union were to strike.    Mr. Wool also noted that talks are underway at Intalco Aluminum Corp.'s aluminum smelter in Ferndale, Wash., where a union contract expires Sept. 26. Intalco, a unit of San Mateo, Calif.-based Alumax Inc., has annual capacity of 259,000 metric tons of aluminum. Alumax, in turn, is a unit of Amax Inc., New York.    William J. MacDonald, divisional vice president for North American extrusion and recycling at Indal Ltd., Toronto, said he hasn't been able to build inventory for Indal's eight aluminum extrusion plants in Canada and the U.S. &quot;Our inventories are probably lower than we would like to see them,&quot; he said. &quot;Metal is in tight supply.&quot;    Although Mr. MacDonald said he doesn't expect a strike at Alcan, the prospect worries him. &quot;The timing would be difficult for the industry,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
