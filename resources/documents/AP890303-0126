Winter storm warnings were posted over much of Utah, northwesternNew Mexico, southwestern Colorado, south-central Wyoming, much ofSouth Dakota, most of Minnesota, and parts of Iowa, Wisconsin, andMichigan.   In the Rockies, 16 inches of snow fell overnight at SteamboatLake, Colo.   In the Northwest, record cold hit a day after a record snowstormblamed for four deaths that dumped up to 14 inches of snow inWashington's Puget Sound area. Seattle-Tacoma, Wash., hit a recordlow of 24 degrees, Portland, Ore., hit 29 and Astoria, Ore., had arecord 24, the National Weather Service said.   Drifting snow closed a section of Interstate 15 in central Utahfor about an hour during the morning rush and the Utah HighwayPatrol was so busy with reports of fender-benders it could notprovide an estimate on the number of accidents.   A foot of snow fell by midday at Worthington, Minn., with 1 to 3inches over most of the rest of the southern part of the state, theweather service said. Two traffic deaths were blamed on the snow.   ``Traffic is very slow and it's slippery in spots,'' MinnesotaState Patrol Trooper Everett Hurd said of conditions inMinneapolis-St. Paul.   South Dakota authorities reported 10 inches of snow in the EagleButte area in the northwestern part of the state, with 6 to 8 incheselsewhere. The snow started falling Thursday and Sioux Falls, in thestate's southeast corner, had 6{ inches by Thursday night.   ``People are wanting this snow, farmers especially, so we'regiving them what they want,'' meteorologist Chris Jansen said.   After several years of drought, the mountain snowpack in Montanawas near normal for the first time in seven years after the stormdumped more than a foot of snow in places, officials say.   The weather service said Helena and Great Falls already haveexceeded their average annual snowfall, with Helena recording 60inches and Great Falls 70.3 inches.   ``Things are looking pretty good this year,'' said Phil Farnes,snow survey supervisor for the Soil Conservation Service.``Statewide we area between 80 to 95 percent of our average.''   Northern Iowa got 2 to 6 inches, with northerly wind causingdrifting.   West Union, Iowa, School Superintendent Donald Mueller said hecanceled classes for fear that buses might get stuck. ``We had lightsnow at 5 o'clock but it has turned to what I'd call heavy with 20-,30-mile per hour winds,'' he said.   Radio station WCCO in Minneapolis, which regularly broadcastsschool closing announcements, reported it counted more than 180schools idled by the storm in southwestern and southern Minnesota.   Up to 5 inches of snow accumulated in western Nebraska andfreezing rain glazed roads in the east, closing dozens of schools.Omaha Metropolitan Area Transit buses started limited service morethan three hours late because of icy roads, the city's EppleyAirfield was closed and garbage pickup was suspended.   Freezing drizzle knocked out power lines in several areas ofnorthwest Kansas, and more than 300 utility poles were down inSherman County. There was no estimate on the number of affectedcustomers.   At Oberlin, Kan., KFNF-FM's 420-foot broadcast tower collapsedunder the weight of ice from two days of freezing rain.   ``At 8:30 I heard what sounded like pieces of ice breaking offand hitting the roof. It kept getting louder and louder and ended upsounding like a freight train,'' said KFNF operations manager JanBainter, who was alone in the studio at the time.   Herb Deremer, general manager and part owner of KFNF, said itwould be at least a week before the station would be back on the air.   Freezing rain also extended into Illinois. Chicago's O'Hare andMidway airports remained open, but flight delays averaged about anhour, the city's aviation department said.</TEXT></DOC>
