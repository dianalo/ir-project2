This AD requires specified operational limitations pertainingto the use of the FMS navigation computers and the omega/VLF sensors. Thisamendment is prompted by reports of unannunciated FMS navigation positionerrors as the result of one errant omega/VLF sensor. This condition, ifnot corrected, could result in navigation outside the aircraft's assignedairspace.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Herb Peters, Aerospace Engineer,Systems and Equipment Branch, ANM-130L, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region,Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, LongBeach, California 90806-2425; telephone (213) 988-5353.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>A Falcon Model 900 series airplane,equipped with dual Honeywell Inc., Sperry FMZ-800 Flight Management System(FMS) navigation computers, a single omega/VLF sensor selected for useby both FMS's, and two inertial reference systems (IRS) experienced a 25nautical mile lateral position error while crossing the North AtlanticOcean. Investigation revealed that multiple, unannunciated FMS navigationcomputer navigation errors can occur when each operational FMS navigationcomputer is receiving position information from one erroneous omega/VLFsensor. The navigation errors can occur under the following conditions:(1) When an aircraft is equipped with two or more FMS navigation computers,two or more IRS's, and one or more omega/VLF sensors, with only one operationalomega/VLF sensor being used by the two operational FMS's; (2) when thataircraft is operating at least one hour beyond the range of the VOR/DMEsignals; and (3) when the omega/VLF sensor being used by the FMS's, whileproducing erroneous data (in this case a 25 nautical mile error), is indicatingby its quality factor that its output is useable.Investigation also revealed that there are operational ways to avoid thesespecified unannunciated navigation errors. With two operational FMS's,one or more operational IRS's, and one operational omega/VLF sensor, thesenavigation errors are annunciated, if, upon reaching the point of beingone hour beyond the VOR/DME range, the flight crew deselects the operationalomega/VLF sensor from one of the two operational FMS's. Operated this way,the FMS's will produce ``COMPARE POSITIONS'' alerting messages at a fivenautical mile FMS position difference, and ``POSITION DIFFERENCE'' actionand alerting messages at a 10 nautical mile FMS position difference.When operating with one operational FMS navigation computer and two ormore operational IRS's, and upon reaching the point of being one hour beyondVOR/DME range, the single operational omega/VLF navigation error cannotbe detected by the FMS; therefore, the single operational omega/VLF mustbe deselected from the FMS.The FMS provides navigation information to the aircraft's course deviationindicator, flight director, and autopilot; and as presently installed andoperated, can, with a single errant omega/VLF sensor, guide the aircraftoff the desired course without annunciation. This condition, if not corrected,could cause an aircraft to be navigated outside its assigned airspace.Since this situation is likely to exist or develop on any aircraft equippedwith two or more Honeywell/Sperry FMZ-800 navigation computers, two ormore IRS's, and one or more omega/VLF sensors, this AD requires a revisionto the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM)or FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual Supplement (AFMS), to add a newFMS operating limitation. The new FMS operating limitation requires thatwhen navigation offshore, one hour or more beyond VOR/DME range, and (1)when navigating with two FMS', one or more operational IRS's, and onlyone operational omega/VLF sensor, the operational omega/VLF sensor mustbe deselected from one of the two FMS navigation computers; and (2) ifnavigating with one operational FMS, because of an in-flight FMS failure,and with two or more operational IRS's, and one operational omega/VLF sensor,the operational omega/VLF sensor must be deselected from the operationalFMS navigation computer. The FAA will consider revising this AD to specificallydefine the new navigation computers that could provide terminating actionto this AD.Since a situation exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand that it is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291.It is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291with respect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediately tocorrect an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determinedthat this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If it is determinedthat this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOTRegulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation willbe prepared and placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluationis not required). A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the RulesDocket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal AviationRegulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
