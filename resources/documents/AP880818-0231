The ``tentative plan on price and wage reforms'' was passed at athree-day meeting this week of the Politburo, the party's topdecision-making body.   The official Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday the meetingwas held at the coastal resort of Beidaihe, with General SecretaryZhao Ziyang presiding.   The plan also called for strict measures next year to bringinflation under control, especially by reining in spending inunauthorized new buildings and other capital construction.   Details of the plan were not provided, but it appeared torepresent solid support for Zhao Ziyang and others who advocatemore aggressive steps to reform China's inefficient economy byshifting to a more market-oriented economic system.   Speculation has arisen that Zhao is encountering resistance fromeconomic conservatives who feel the reforms are moving too fast,creating unacceptable levels of inflation and fostering socialinstability.   ``China's economy is full of vitality and is developingvigorously,'' Xinhua said. ``The time is favorable to the price andwage reforms.''   Inflation the first half of the year approached 20 percent,partly as a result of the loosening of price controls andproducers' inability to meet rising consumer demand.   Xinhua said that in the next five years the state will continueto control prices of a few important commodities and labor but willliberalize prices for most goods and subject them to marketregulation.   Price reform will focus on ``correcting those exceptionallyirrational problems in prices which seriously hamper the economicdevelopment and the growth of markets,'' it said.   The report said the overall objective of wage reform is to seethat the living standards of most wage earners do not drop.   The government acknowledged that last year, when the inflationrate was said to be 7.3 percent, about 20 percent of urban wageearners reported a decline in their living standards.   Chinese sources said this week that China will soon give itsworkers large raises and link further pay increases to theinflation rate. One source said the average worker, who now takeshome 910 yuan ($246) a year, will soon get an extra 30 yuan amonth, equal to a 28 percent raise.   The 17 Politburo members at the meeting agreed that revampingChina's economic system was crucial to success in price and wagereforms.   A key goal for 1989, according to the plan, will be to raiseeconomic efficiency by making enterprise managers responsible fortheir profits and losses and by strengthening markets.   In a meeting with Japanese journalists at Beidaihe Tuesday, Zhaosaid the government will give priority to enterprise reform. Hesaid the key to better efficiency lies in making all enterprisescompete for markets, promoting the better ones and eliminating theinferior ones. Communist China's first bankruptcy law, which drawsup rules for the closure of losing businesses, will go into effectNov. 1.   China will also forge ahead with reform of its political system,including the separation of party and government functions and therunning of businesses, Xinhua said.   Also in 1989, the government will reduce the purchasing power ofgovernment and semi-official groups, ``while taking tough measuresto counter extravagance and waste to keep the party and governmentorganizations honest,'' the agency reported.   Authorities will crack down on embezzlers, bribetakers, seekersof exorbitant profits, speculators, hoarders and those who imposeeconomic blockades or local protectionism.   China's current pricing system, with its artificially lowceilings on the prices of many raw materials and food items, hasled to widespread corruption among officials who seize largequantities of hard-to-obtain goods and sell them at far higherprices on free markets or the black market.   Xinhua said the Politburo at an earlier meeting decided to drawup the price and wage reform plan, and on June 2 the Party CentralCommittee formed groups of experts to study the matter.   The State Council, or cabinet, discussed the plan at an Aug. 5-9meeting.   Xinhua said the Party Central Committee will take up the planagain at its full session next month.   Zhao told the Japanese journalists the plan will be ready forimplementation by the beginning of 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
