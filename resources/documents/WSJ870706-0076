We have passed this way before.    In 1802, after 18 years of calling for war against the Mussulmen in his consecutive roles as trade commissioner, ambassador to France, secretary of state and president, Thomas Jefferson got Congress to double Americas' Mediterranean fleet. But under a foppish commodore, Richard Valentine Morris, the beefed-up force accomplished practically nothing in the struggle against North Africa's hostage-takers.    Thus, in December 1803, President Jefferson and an ex-Army intelligence officer devised a new plan of dubious legality. It entailed the diversion of government funds for a foreign-policy objective not approved by Congress: overthrowing a foreign regime. Secretary of State James Madison was invited to join their strategy session, but he pleaded indigestion. He may not have wanted to know too much, in case the plan went awry.    Jefferson's co-conspirator was gung-ho Capt. William Eaton, a former scout in the Ohio Territory and later U.S. Consul to Tunis, whence he had been unceremoniously expelled the previous February by Bey Hammouda for failing to bow and scrape like a European envoy. For four years Consul Eaton had pushed for an invasion of North Africa by 5,000 Marines, whom he hoped to lead personally. He wanted to crush the Moslem fundamentalists who had been hijacking and taking hostages for centuries.    Even before Pasha Yusuf of Tripoli wrecked the U.S. consulate in what is now Libya in May 1801 and declared war on the U.S., a declaration not reciprocated by Congress, Eaton schemed to depose him and install the legitimate heir to the throne, the Pasha's placid brother Hamet. Eaton once broached the idea to Commodore Morris, who huffily retorted that the gentlemen of the Congress would not countenance an &quot;obnoxious interference&quot; in the affairs of another country.    Jefferson suspected as much too, which is why in the White House drawing room on Dec. 10, 1803, he and Eaton set their plot in motion. The president promised to persuade Secretary of State Madison to give Eaton $40,000 from State Department funds, which Eaton was to use &quot;for his purposes in settling peace with Tripoli.&quot; However, to fudge accountability for this vague, intentionally undefined mandate, Eaton would be detached from the State Department and lent to the Navy. Jefferson also guaranteed that the Secretary of War would consign Eaton 1,000 rifles from Army stores.    Eaton may have told the president that all he wanted was to hand over the money and weapons to Hamet for a rebellion, but, hungry as he was for glory, that is not what happened. In June 1804, he sailed for the Mediterranean with the fleet, and, with an escort of 11 Marines, found Hamet in Egypt in February 1805. Promoting himself to &quot;general,&quot; he raised a ragtag band of 1,000 mercenary cutthroats and led this &quot;army&quot; for six weeks of grueling trekking over 600 miles of desert to capture the Libyan port of Derna. This spectacular exploit, and his threat to march on &quot;to the shores of Tripoli,&quot; brought the war to a close.    Afterward &quot;General&quot; Eaton, the Col. North of 1805, was celebrated throughout the land, and Congress lauded the president for his conduct of the war. In a congratulatory postwar report by Congress, no mention was made of the State Department funds appropriated by Secretary Madison (who, being the recipient of numerous, heated dispatches from hothead Eaton during his years in Tunis, had to have had some inkling of what the money was for).    Neither was there a fuss over the rifles, weapons purchased by the taxpayers, withdrawn from an Army arsenal and used by Eaton in his Middle Eastern adventure of dubious legality.    In those days, foreign issues short of full-blown war were left to the executive, for, as Henry Adams said of him, Thomas Jefferson's ideas of presidential power in foreign policy were &quot;little short of royal.&quot; Jefferson's secretary of state, the primary author of the Constitution, did not gainsay this; indeed, he played his own sly part.    ---   Mr. Sorkin is writing a book on the Barbary Wars. </TEXT></DOC>
