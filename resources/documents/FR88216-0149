Fuger, Jr.,project attorney.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Proposed Regulations</ITAG>The Roosevelt bridge presently opens on signal except weekdays from 7 a.m.to 9 a.m., 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. when it opens only onthe hour and half hour. On weekends and holidays from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.it opens on the hour, 20 minutes after the hour and 40 minutes after thehour. Martin County requested a change to these regulations on January21, 1987. On October 2, 1987, the Commander, Seventh Coast Guard Districtpublished a notice of proposed rulemaking (52 FR 36961) soliciting commentson regulations for the Roosevelt Bridge and the Evans Crary Bridge. Theproposed Roosevelt Bridge regulation would have required the bridge toopen only on the hour and half hour from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday throughFriday. In addition the draw would not be required to open at 8 a.m., 8:30a.m., 4:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. A significant number of objections were receivedfrom navigation interests. Many pointed out that the adjacent railroadbridge is sometimes closed on the hour and half hour, thus preventing avessel from proceeding until the railroad bridge was opened.The existing regulations and the proposed supplemental rules provide foran opening immediately after the railroad bridge opens if it is closedduring a scheduled opening period. Over 30 commenters stated that the twoproposed 90 minute closed periods were too long and potentially hazardousto vessels. After review of these objections to the Roosevelt Bridge regulations,Martin County has proposed one opening at the halfway point of both themorning and evening 90 minute closure periods. Neither opening would occurduring the peak 15 minute vehicular traffic periods. Public vessels ofthe United States, tugs with tows, and vessels in a situation where a delaywould endanger life or property would continue to be passed at any time.No objections were received to the Evans Crary Bridge regulations containedin the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (52 FR 36961). As a result the FinalRule for this bridge is unchanged from the proposed rule and has been published(53 FR 119) with an effective date of February 4, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment and Certification</ITAG>These proposed regulations are considered to be non-major under ExecutiveOrder 12291 on Federal Regulation and nonsignificant under the Departmentof Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979).The economic impact of this proposal is expected to be so minimal thata full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. We conclude this because theregulations exempt tugs with tows. Since the economic impact of this proposalis expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted,it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117</ITAG>Bridges.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Regulations</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, the Coast Guard proposes to amend Part117 of Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, as folows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 117_DRAWBRIDGE OPERATION REGULATIONS</ITAG>1.
