Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   The dollar tumbled to its lowest level against the yen yesterday since early January, when the world's major central banks intervened in foreign exchange markets to prop up the U.S. currency.    The dollar also weakened significantly against other major currencies. Dealers said the dollar was undercut by reports of unexpectedly strong U.S. personal income and personal consumption, which stirred fears of a widening U.S. trade deficit. The reports, along with other indicators, also fed fears of renewed inflation, adding to pressure on the dollar.    Underscoring these economic concerns were bearish comments about the dollar's near-term health by a former White House chief economic adviser, Martin Feldstein. He also predicted a 15% to 20% drop in the dollar's value in three to four years.    In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 125.55 yen, down 0.9% from 126.75 Wednesday. Yesterday's dollar-yen exchange rate was the lowest since Jan. 4, when central banks representing the Group of Seven nations began intervening heavily in support of the U.S. currency, lifting it from a 40-year low of 120.20 yen. The intervention then was led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which purchased $685 million in a two-week period beginning Jan. 4. Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada are the other Group of Seven nations.    Dealers said the Bank of Japan intervened to buy dollars in Tokyo trading Thursday, as the dollar's value began eroding. But no other major central banks were sighted in the market and the dollar steadily drifted lower throughout the day.    &quot;The market is very bearish toward the dollar, concerned about inflation and not convinced that the trade deficit has turned around,&quot; said John Lynam, vice president for foreign exchange at Security Pacific National Bank, New York.    In Tokyo Friday, the dollar opened at 125.68 yen, off from 126.30 yen at the close of activity Thursday in Japan.    Two reports of a stronger than expected U.S. economy caused the most harm to the dollar during New York trading. The news that personal income grew 0.9% in February and personal consumption expenditures increased 0.7% were seen as bad omens for the U.S. trade deficit. &quot;Everything seems to revolve around the trade numbers, and a strong economy translates into a bigger trade deficit because there's more money around to spend,&quot; Mr. Lynam said.    The reported comments by Mr. Feldstein were similar to his earlier statements but still contributed to the negative atmosphere for the dollar. He said he &quot;wouldn't be surprised&quot; to see the dollar at 120 yen or lower within six months.    The dollar's initial drop yesterday during moderately heavy selling in Tokyo raised speculation that Japanese insurance companies might have begun unloading dollars purchased earlier this month with the aim of supporting the U.S. currency.    The insurance companies were believed to be supporting the dollar in the market because of their fears about taking write-downs on the values of many of their dollar-denominated investments. Under Japanese accounting rules, these companies would be forced to realize foreign exchange losses on certain foreign-denominated investments if the yen strengthens more than 15% in the year ending March 31.    For the firms to avoid taking these losses for their U.S. holdings, the dollar's average daily value this month would have to remain above 126.85 yen. &quot;They have only five days more. If the dollar stays above 123.50 (yen), they can make it,&quot; said Masakazu Miyamori, senior vice president and chief trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd., New York.    With that much of a cushion remaining, traders said they believe Japanese institutional investors have begun selling dollars, partly out of concern that April 1 will bring a rush of sales, pushing the currency sharply lower. &quot;Some banks have jumped the gun,&quot; said J. Thomas Stanley, a trader at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York.    Separately, the Reserve Bank of Australia is estimated to have sold about 400 million Australian dollars in the market Wednesday, according to economists at Bankers Trust Australia Ltd., in Sydney.    The estimate was made in Bankers Trust's daily economic commentary.    The Reserve Bank confirmed Wednesday it was intervening more heavily in the foreign exchange market after the Australian currency rose to a two-year high of 74.20 U.S. cents, but didn't specify the amounts.    In New York, traders at commercial banks said the U.S. Federal Reserve sold Australian dollars on behalf of the Australian central bank Wednesday.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $3 an ounce to $454.10 in heavy trading. The estimated volume was six million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $453.75 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Thursday, March 24, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
