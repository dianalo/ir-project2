NPF-10 and NPF-15, issued to Southern California Edison Company, SanDiego Gas and Electric Company, the City of Anaheim, California and theCity of Riverside, California (the licensees), for the operation of SanOnofre Nuclear Generating Station, Units 2 and 3 (the facilities), locatedin San Diego County, California.The application for amendments was dated May 6, 1988, as supplemented byletters dated August 25 and December 7, 1988. The Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendments was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 9, 1988 (53 FR 35138). The amendments, as proposed by the licensees, would revise (1) LicenseConditions 2.C(14) and 2.C(12) (Fire Protection) of Units 2 and 3 respectivelyto reflect the revised fire protection program; (2) License Conditions2.G (Reporting Requirements) of both units to exempt fire protection programviolations from the 24-hour reporting requirement; (3) Table 3.3.9, ``RemoteShutdown Monitoring Instrumentation,'' to allow for plant instrument improvements;and (4) several technical specifications related to the revised fire protectionprogram. Generic Letter 86-10 allows licensees to make changes to their approvedfire protection program without prior Commission approval if those changeswould not adversely affect the ability to achieve and maintain safe shutdown.Therefore, that portion of the proposed fire protection license conditionchange is acceptable. However, Generic Letter 86-10 also adequately defineschanges which would adversely affect the ability to achieve and maintainsafe shutdown; therefore, it is not appropriate to include in the licensecondition the definition proposed by the licensees. Therefore, that portionof the proposed fire protection license condition has been denied. In additionto the above partial denial, three other provisions in the proposed fireprotection license condition were not included because they were satisfiedby the licensee's submittal of August 25, 1988. Also, the proposed additionof Technical Specification 6.9.3 was not included because it is not required.The licensees were notified of the Commission's denial of this requestby letter dated January 20, 1989. The other changes requested by the applicationhave been approved by the issuance of Amendments No. 69 and 38. By March 2, 1989, the licensees may demand a hearing with respect to thedenial described above and any persons whose interest may be affected bythis proceeding may file a written petition for leave to intervene. A request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW,Washington, DC, by the above date.
