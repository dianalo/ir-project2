O'BoyleStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP </IN><DATELINE> BONN, West Germany  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a country not noted for the volatility of its politicians, Oskar Lafontaine is a Vesuvius.    Mr. Lafontaine is expected to be elected vice chairman of the opposition Social Democrats Sunday, a move that could propel him into the chancellorship. Yet consider the statement he made during West Germany's missile debate a few years ago, when he compared Social Democratic Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's support of U.S. missile deployment to the behavior of Nazi concentration camp commandants.    Or consider the way Mr. Lafontaine, who favors Germany's withdrawal from the Western alliance and opposes all forms of nuclear energy, again turned on the leadership of his party in January. The day after the Social Democrats were routed in the national election he attacked defeated candidate Johannes Rau at a news conference for not seeking an alliance with the leftist Greens party. Mr. Lafontaine's politicking made him want to &quot;vomit,&quot; Mr. Rau said.    The fact that he evokes such strong emotions doesn't seem to bother the 43-year-old leftist governor of West Germany's Saarland. &quot;If I want to insult someone, I do it to his face,&quot; he says in an interview. Besides, he adds, &quot;It's too boring if you always agree.&quot;    While Mr. Lafontaine isn't likely to always agree with other politicians, lately he seems to have toned down his rhetoric. He no longer speaks of unilateral disarmament, for example. The reason, political analysts suggest, is his powerful ambition to be his party's next candidate for chancellor.    By West German standards, Mr. Lafontaine has had a meteoric political career. In 1976, at 32 years of age, he was the youngest man ever elected mayor of a major German city, Saarbruecken. Two years ago, at 41, he was elected governor of the Saar, a steelmaking state on the French border, as his party took control of the state parliament for the first time.    On Sunday, he will take his biggest step yet toward national prominence with his anticipated election as vice chairman of the Social Democrats. Hans-Jochen Vogel, a former chancellor candidate, is expected to take former Chancellor Willy Brandt's place as chairman. Still, Mr. Lafontaine is likely to use his new post as a springboard to capturing the party nomination.    That prospect frightens his opponents, who see him as dangerously irresponsible and incapable of dealing with what they consider a Soviet threat. His tendency to seek controversy scares even his own party. Some middle-of-the-road Social Democrats fear he will widen a party split that began over U.S. missile deployment and, in 1982, led to the collapse of the Schmidt government.    &quot;How could Lafontaine ever unite us? It is because of him that people turn away,&quot; Manfred Reimann, a Social Democratic member of parliament, charged in an open letter last week to the party's leadership. He urged them to block Mr. Lafontaine's election.    Mr. Lafontaine responds to criticism with a jaunty playfulness. &quot;I can't accept the notion that I'm not moderate,&quot; he says. &quot;It's the other people who aren't moderate when it comes to armaments. . . . When I first heard people professing that they thought an atomic war was winnable, I thought they were mad.&quot;    His supporters regard him as a politician who, like his confidant and political &quot;godfather&quot; Mr. Brandt, knows how to capture the national mood. &quot;Lafontaine isn't your typical German politician,&quot; says Norbert Wieczorek, a Social Democratic member of parliament and friend of Mr. Lafontaine. &quot;He's controversial. But that's part of his attraction.&quot;    Many polls show he is highly popular among Social Democrats. He has also shown an ability to steal voters from the Greens, something his party must do at a national level if it is to regain its standing. Yet, to reunite his fragmented party, he must move closer to the center -- and risk losing voters attracted to him because of his leftist ideology.    That evolution appears to be happening. Though Mr. Lafontaine's anti-nuclear stand is as rigid as ever, his statements on defense suggest a rethinking: He says Europeans should cooperate more for defense. He even suggests that the ability to strike offensively at targets &quot;deep&quot; behind the Iron Curtain is crucial to West European security. &quot;A person can't always keep the same opinions,&quot; he says.    Born in 1943 in the Saar, he was raised by his mother, a widow whose husband had died in the war, and educated in Catholic boarding schools. After receiving a college degree in physics in 1969, Mr. Lafontaine, who has a passion for fine food and jogs to keep his weight down, was a rising star in the Social Democrats. But he wasn't considered part of the left wing; until 1979, he supported Chancellor Schmidt's defense policies.    Critics charge that he changed his foreign-policy stances to sharpen his profile within the Social Democrats. Whatever the reason, his career got a boost with West Germany's environmentalist-pacifist surge in the early 1980s.    Soon he was a leader of a new generation in the party's left wing. A gifted orator, he addressed innumerable peace demonstrations.    Among his guiding political values, he says, are his hatred of fascism and his desire to help the poor. When he was mayor of Saarbruecken, two paintings adorned his office, one depicting a Nazi concentration camp, the other a coal-mining scene. Perhaps his biggest success as governor was the federal bailout of Arbed-Saarstahl G.m.b.H., a troubled steelmaker and the state's largest employer.    Associates say that while Mr. Lafontaine is capable of bending to the political winds, he holds fast to deeply held principles, like opposition to nuclear power. Says Ulrich Steger, a friend and fellow Social Democrat, &quot;He's a pragmatic person except for areas he identifies as evil -- and the atom is one of them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
