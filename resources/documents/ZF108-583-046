(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Katherine RideoutandM;At U.S.andP;  microcomputer installations, the responsibility for the last stageof the software buying process -- the actual authorization to purchase --lies primarily in the hands of either the managers of end-user departments orthe microcomputer professionals who support the end users, according to arecent PC Week survey.andM;The survey data was collected from PC Week's Corporate Advisory Panel, agroup of individuals from more than 500 institutions, businesses andgovernment agencies nationwide.andM;All of the panelists are directly involved in the overall implementation ofmicro-related technology at their sites.andM;This particular survey, which was conducted during April and May, askedpanelists to indicate who, within their organizations, plays the primary roleat each of several stages in the purchase process for new software.andM;These stages were identified as follows: the discovery of new software; itsfunctional and technical evaluation; the creation and maintenance of&quot;approved&quot; lists of software packages; and the final authorization of newsoftware purchases.andP;  (The three preceding Barometer columns in this seriesdiscussed software discovery, product evaluation and approved softwarelists.)andM;For this survey, PC Week examined the last of these stages -- final purchaseauthorization -- from several different angles.andM;At sites maintaining approved lists of software packages, panel members wereasked to identify the person who typically gives final authorization for thepurchases of software included on such lists, as opposed to purchases ofsoftware not included on standard lists.andP;  At sites not maintaining lists ofapproved software, panel members identified the person responsible forauthorizing purchases of additional copies of any previously purchasedsoftware.andM;At sites with approved software lists, purchase authorization for packagesalready on the list is primarily handled either by end-user department headsor by any of a variety of micro-support professionals, including micromanagers, information center managers, programmers, technical supportspecialists and network managers.andM;End-user managers typically have the final say on software purchases at 32percent of panel sites with approved lists, while micro-support staffers havethe final say at 31 percent of these sites.andM;At 20 percent of sites with approved-software lists, data-processing orinformation-systems managers have the last word on purchases made fromapproved lists.andM;Support Professionals DominateandM;For software not included on a site's approved-software list, however,micro-support specialists take a clear lead over both end-user managers anddata-processing or information-systems managers.andM;At 34 percent of these panel sites, a micro-support staffer typically hasfinal approval of such acquisitions, compared with 24 percent at sites thatrely on end-user managers and 22 percent at sites that rely ondata-processing or information-systems managers.andM;At sites that do not maintain approved lists of software packages, end-usermanagers usually have the last word on buying additional copies of softwarethat is already in use, a scenario typical of 41 percent of such sites.andM;Only 19 percent of such sites use micro-support personnel to authorize thesemundane purchases, compared with the 22 percent where data-processing orinformation-systems managers perform this function.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
