Synoptic comparisonsamong the bayous were made on eight trips over a two-year period. Additionally,each bayou was sampled intensively for small-scale distribution on fouroccasions. Numbers of all zooplankton taxa were consistently higher inthe agricultural bayou than in either of the other bayous. Patterns ofsmall-scale spatial variability also differed among the bayous. The agriculturalbayou appeared to be a relatively healthy estuarine tributary. The municipalbayou was probably subjected to chronic environmental stress that issevere in the vicinity of the municipal sewage and storm-drain outfalls.Evidence indicated that the industrial bayou suffered from frequent,but not continuous, episodes of environmental stress throughout its length.</TEXT></DOC>
