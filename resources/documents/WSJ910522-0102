The answer is simple. H.R. 1 isnot a civil-rights bill. It is a bill which will encouragequotas based on race, ethnicity, religion and gender.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Ed Koch is a Democrat mugged by quotas. The former How'm IDoin'? mayor of New York City and former liberal U.S.representative has lobbied Congress against the civil-rightsbill, jawboned leaders of Jewish groups and planned strategywith White House lawyers.   Mr. Koch's reaction against the bill is one reason why itwill make no difference that Democrats in Congress havetemporarily withdrawn their bill. After two years of claimingthis is not a quota bill, the week or so the Democrats planfor going back to the blackboard will not produce a non-quotabill.   Mr. Koch recalls that he first began to look closely atthe bill after he read an article in November in the Forward,a national Jewish weekly, that described how the bill wouldforce employers for the first time either to hire byreligious quotas or risk legal liability. Joseph Morris ofthe Chicago-based Lincoln Legal Foundation wrote that thebill would outlaw &quot;disparate impact&quot; not just by race and sexbut also by religion and national origin. Counting byreligion sounded a warning.   As Mr. Koch wrote in a Feb. 5 article on the Journaleditorial page, disparate-impact analysis is best understoodas a fancy legal term inviting quotas. Under a 1971 SupremeCourt case, plaintiffs can prove discrimination even whenthere is no evidence of intentional discrimination. Onlylawyers could dream up an offense called non-intentionaldiscrimination, but here's how it works: If an employer'swork force does not precisely mirror the area's labor pool ofminorities, presto, the defendant is presumed guilty.   Again, only lawyers could claim that only discriminationprevents every company in every industry from hiring thestatistically correct number of Hispanics, Methodists,Ukrainian-Americans. In a non-lawyer's world, of course, itwould be a fluke if the employees of any single companyanywhere managed to reflect perfectly every conceivablesubgroup.   To be fair to the Democrats, the White House version ofthe bill would also continue the use of statistics alone toestablish &quot;discrimination.&quot; The big difference is that withpunitive damages and other lures for contingency-fee lawyers,the Democrats' bill would create enormous incentives forcompanies to lock in quotas as the best and perhaps onlydefense to accusations of disparate impact. The bill wouldalso water down defenses to lawsuits by making the definitionof terms such as &quot;business necessity&quot; even more vague thanthe courts have left them.   Mr. Koch, soft-spoken as always, explained that his formerDemocratic colleagues in Congress &quot;got out of touch becausethey are so frightened by militant black and white leadershipin the civil-rights groups.&quot; Mr. Koch said, &quot;It's thepolitically correct position that blacks need help, Hispanicsneed help, even Jews with Spanish surnames need help, butAsian-Americans don't. I happen to think that is insane.   &quot;You get dragged along. Everyone wants to do the rightthing, but you find that it's the wrong thing,&quot; he said. &quot;Theeasy right thing to do is to give groups preferences, butthis means that innocent white people are going to suffer. Ido not accept that.&quot;   After he began to speak out, several Jewish groups alsoreconsidered their typically unblinking support for anylegislation that calls itself a civil-rights bill. The groupsthat now most strongly oppose the bill represent OrthodoxJews, whose members follow strict dietary, dress and Sabbathobservance rules that set them apart. They understand thatthe bill invites employers to start keeping track of thereligion of workers and tempts them to hire and fire to comeas close as possible to reflecting the makeup of the localcommunity. Yet even asking someone's religion is now rightlyconsidered out of bounds.   Mr. Koch's outspokenness against the bill won him aninvitation to the White House. Mr. Koch told Boyden Gray, thepresident's counsel, that race-norming was the smoking gun ofquotas. This is the practice of grading test scores on a raceand ethnic curve; a 300 on one aptitude test is reported topotential employers as a 79 for a black applicant, a 62 foran Hispanic and a 39 for a white or Asian.   Democrats now say they might try to limit test scoring byrace-norming. They forget that the reason race-norming wasinvented in the first place in the early 1970s was as adefense to the then-new disparate-impact lawsuits. Anycivil-rights bill that increases the exposure of employers tolawsuits based simply on statistics will only encourage racenorming and other sleights of hand to meet quotas withoutadmitting the deed.   &quot;Over the years those who now advocate&quot; this civil-rightsbill, Mr. Koch said, &quot;concealed the impact of some of thelegislation, court decisions and administrative agencyrulings which in the past have encouraged quotas by referringto those measures benignly as affirmative action. I supportaffirmative action when it is defined as reaching out andencouraging minorities to apply for a position or contract,&quot;he said, &quot;providing them with mentoring services where neededbut always filling the position or awarding the contractsolely on merit and never excluding any group on the basis ofrace, ethnicity, religion or gender.&quot;   Most Americans probably agree with Mr. Koch's praise forvoluntary affirmative action. Nor is there any seriousopposition to laws that prohibit intentional discrimination-- that is, what non-lawyers call discrimination. The paradoxfor politicians who want a new civil-rights bill is that nolaw can go beyond this prohibition against discrimination toalso capture all the nuances of encouraging minoritieswithout discriminating against whites. This is why we endedup with a sterile and legalistic debate about statistics.   The best civil-rights bill now probably is no civil-rightsbill. If there are problems prosecuting people whodiscriminate, let's have a bill that deals with the issue. Wedo not need to legally mandate the all-but-impossiblerequirement of perfectly matching the race, sex, religiousand ethnic makeup of the available labor pool.   There is an alternative to expanding the imperial reach oflawyers, lawsuits and judges. This is to encourage voluntaryaffirmative action by people of good will. Put it this way.The civil-rights groups that support this bill believe thatthe way to accomplish harmony is to encourage more lawyers tobring more lawsuits. As the debate over this bill shows,lawsuits and harmony remain an unlikely combination.</TEXT></DOC>
