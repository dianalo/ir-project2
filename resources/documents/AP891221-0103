(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A sometimes sobbing Tammy Faye Bakker tolda church congregation of her life without Jim Bakker and how she'shired an appeals lawyer to get her husband out of prison.   ``Our lawyer felt we have a 77 percent chance, praise theLord,'' Mrs. Bakker said to thunderous applause at the Carpenter'sHome Church on Wednesday.   Bakker is in a Rochester, Minn., federal prison serving a45-year sentence for defrauding investors of the PTL Ministry,which he founded.   Mrs. Bakker defended her husband, saying he is incapable ofdefrauding anybody.   ``Jim walks in his own steps,'' she said. ``He doesn't walk inthe judge's steps. He doesn't walk in the government's steps. Whoare we to say his steps were not supposed to walk through prison?''   The Rev. Karl Strader said he invited Mrs. Bakker to speak aftershe came to the church Sunday to see a play. He said the invitationwas his way of showing friendship to the Bakkers during theholidays and help her financially.   The church did not compensate Mrs. Bakker, but a collection wastaken after her talk to pay for airfare for her and her son totravel to the Minnesota prison during Christmas.   The Bakkers' New Covenant church set up following the PTLscandals has been moving from storefront to storefront in Orlandobecause of financial problems.</TEXT><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger accepted substantialundisclosed libel damages Thursday for an untrue story in a tabloidthat claimed he held ``fervent Nazi and anti-Semitic views.''   Schwarzenegger's lawyer, James Price, told the High Court it wasnow accepted by News Group Newspapers Ltd., publishers of the Newsof the World, and journalist Sharon Ring, that there was no truthin any of the allegations.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tiny Tim appeared before the citycommission and tiptoed his way through an endorsement of asculptor's effort to live in a storefront studio.   Local artists figured the 1960s celebrity could help sculptorDarien Bogart persuade city commissioners Wednesday to let Bogartlive in a downtown studio.   Tiny Tim, who is in town for club performances, was glad tooblige. He even stopped to serenade passers-by plucking his ukuleleon the steps of City Hall.   But as Tiny Tim stood before the City Commission, dressed in amulticolored coat and a red, white and blue striped tie, hissupport of Bogart wavered.   ``I'm supportive with a lot of ifs,'' Tiny Tim said.   It might be all right if Bogart kept the place clean and didn'tbother neighboring businesses, he said.   But later: ``I can't see him living in a store that is on a mainthoroughfare. The danger there also is that others may follow suit.To make it a thing to spread, right now it appears to be out oftaste.''   Commissioners decided to research the issue and reconsider it inFebruary.</TEXT><DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Singer Glen Campbell has come to the aid of a5{-month-old boy whose doctors say will die unless he gets a livertransplant.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Six of the seven O'Kelley brothers _ whofought to remain together after their mother died, their fatherabandoned them and their home burned down _ held a reunion on theset where their story is being filmed.   During an interview Wednesday with the television show,``Entertainment Tonight,'' the brothers were asked how the moviewill affect them.   ``We'll get some publicity, but in a couple of months it will beback to normal,'' said Michael, 15.   After news of their family disaster put the rural Gainesvillebrothers in the spotlight in 1986 and 1987, they received more than$200,000 in cash and gifts and a contract for themade-for-television movie, ``Fire in the Heart.''   A contractor also built them a four-bedroom house on the7.5-acre farm where they had lived in a trailer.   The attention also led to their separation, they said.   Last year, Terry O'Kelley, now 22, relinquished custody of hisfour younger brothers, saying tensions between the siblings made itimpossible for him to continue as a single parent.
