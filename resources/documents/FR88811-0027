This rule proposedto preempt the application and enforcement of prevailing wage rates determinedunder State law on projects assisted by HUD under the United States HousingAct of 1937, as amended (USHA), whenever the State wage rate exceeded thecorresponding Federally-determined prevailing wage rate for that trade.(Under section 12 of the USHA, the Federal prevailing wage rate is determinedeither by the U.S. Department of Labor pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act,in the case of project development, or by HUD in the case of project operation).Under the proposal, a State or local wage rate would not apply to a projectif the State- or locally-determined rate for a trade to be used on theproject exceeded the corresponding Federally-determined rate. Any bid documentsfor project work that would otherwise be subject to State law requiringpayment of State- or locally-determined prevailing wage rates would berequired to contain a statement that whenever any State- or locally-determinedrate exceeds the corresponding Federally-determined wage rate, the State-or locally-determined rate is inapplicable to the contract and shall notbe enforced. In addition, the PHA or IHA would not be required to pay itsown employees engaged on the project at higher State wage rates. The rulealso proposed to prohibit enforcement of such rates against contractorsor subcontractors and PHAs or IHAs. Because HUD-determined prevailing wagerates are limited in all cases to basic hourly rates without considerationof fringe benefits, the rule proposed to provide that fringe benefits determinedunder State law would be excluded from the comparison with the HUD-determinedwage rate; in that situation, preemption of the entire State-determinedrate (both fringe benefits and the basic hourly rate) would occur if thebasic hourly rate determined under State law, exclusive of fringe benefits,exceeded the HUD-determined rate. The rule also proposed to apply to IHAsand to tribal prevailing wage laws. <ITAG tagnum="85">Discussion of Public Comments and Changes Made in the Final Rule </ITAG>HUD received 81 comments in response to the proposed rule, including 55comments generally supporting the issuance of a preemption rule, 23 opposingthe rule, and 3 that did not express a clear position supporting or opposingthe rule. The comments included 49 from housing authorities, 10 directlyfrom labor organizations or their counsel (in addition to other labor organizationcomments forwarded with Congressional comments), 7 from Congressional representatives,5 from States or State agencies or officials, and several from trade, redevelopmentand other organizations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Cost Savings </ITAG>A large number of comments concerned the question of whether the rule wouldresult in cost savings in construction and rehabilitation and/or the abilityto perform work on a greater number of units with the same amount of Federalfunds. For example, one labor organization commented that it appeared HUDlacks any real evidence supporting its conclusion that it is necessaryto preempt higher State-determined prevailing wage rates, since the factthat some State rates are higher does not prove that labor costs on suchprojects are higher or that the costs of such projects are higher thanthey might otherwise be. A state law department commented that evidenceof higher State-determined wage rates alone does not lead logically toHUD's conclusion about the effect of these rates on the cost or numberof lower income housing units. Another labor organization asserted thatHUD ignored the findings of three of its own investigations, two by theOffice of Inspector General finding a direct correlation between prevailingwage requirement violations and poor quality construction due to use ofinexperienced and unskilled workers, and one by its Office of Program Planningand Evaluation finding a low correlation between average wage rates andaverage dwelling costs on a sample of Indian housing projects.HUD rejects the notion that wage rates, which may constitute one-thirdor more of the total cost of rehabilitation work, can be increased as muchas 50 to 100 percent (depending on location, job classifications, and natureof work), without affecting overall project cost or the amount of renovationwork performed. Indirect confirmation of this is found in the comment ofa labor organization, which objected to the proposed rule for the followingreason:<ITAG tagnum="21">Where the federal Davis-Bacon or HUD rates are substantially lowerthan the wage rates contained in collective bargaining agreements contractorswho are parties to such agreements would be competitively disadvantagedin obtaining work on federally funded housing projects. This will resultin a deprivation of work for employees covered by collective bargainingagreements and will undermine the wage and benefit standards in the locality.</ITAG>Moreover, at least 18 PHAs commented that the proposed rule preemptinghigher State wage rates would result in cost savings. For example, threeCalifornia PHAs commented that the rule could, in some cases, reduce thecost of new construction and modernization under the Comprehensive ImprovementAssistance Program (CIAP) by 15 to 30 percent, and that cost savings inlabor would directly translate into either more units being modernizedor constructed within the same budget amounts or improvements in the materialsused and a longer life for the units, with less operating costs. A PHAin New York State commented that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Our comparisons of State and Davis-Bacon wage rates as applicableto our rehabilitation, modernization and new development projects indicatethat the State rates exceed the Federal rates by a substantial percentageand, in many cases, would have permitted us to accomplish only half ofour original project scope. This would obviously undermine our effortsto meet the needs of the low-income and homeless people in our area. Furthermore,it would be counter productive to our attempts to stretch the ever-diminishingdollars we have to work with.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mandatory use of State wage rates would increase the overall costof our competitively bid projects to the point of making them unfeasiblewithin the limits of our budget. The end result would be diminished decent,safe and sanitary housing opportunities for the people we serve.</ITAG>Another PHA in New York State noted that New York State rates had substantialimpact on the PHA's ``residential'' work (generally, residential buildingsof four stories or less) but very little impact on ``commercial'' (residentialhigh rise) work. The authority cited a heating system replacement projectwhich fit both HUD's and the State's respective definitions of ``residential''work and was first bid with Federal ``residential'' rates; however, aftera lawsuit in State court, the project was required to be rebid with Staterates. Because of New York's methodology for determining wage rates, thenew rates deemed applicable by the court and the State in the absence ofa separate collectively bargained ``residential'' rate were actually thehigher ``commercial'' rates, which were merely labeled as ``residential''.The PHA reported that the following changes were made in the project whenit was rebid:<ITAG tagnum="21">The scope of project was then completely downgraded to offset theanticipated increase in labor costs. Some of the changes included the eliminationof thermostatic valves on convectors, lesser quality convectors, a decreasefrom cast iron to copper piping, the encapsulation of asbestos rather thanits complete removal, etc. An estimated $800,000 of work and product qualitywas cut from the project. The second bids totaled $4,667,000_an increaseof $56,000_in spite of the cost containment measures. Thus, the wage rateissue cost the Housing Authority and HUD about 19% in lost improvementsfor public housing.</ITAG>Nine PHAs commented that additional indirect cost savings would be achievedby eliminating administrative burdens associated with applying State ratesto projects.A trade association comment included examples of higher State wage ratesleading to overall higher bid costs, including the statement of a membercontractor in California, operating in the Sacramento, Los Angeles andSan Francisco areas, that California State rates were 10 to 20 percenthigher than Federal rates and that such wage differentials would increasethe contractor's total job cost by 3 to 4 percent, which would be reflectedin its bid prices.Also, in recent Buffalo, New York federal court litigation challengingHUD's refusal to apply state rates, and expert witness for the plaintiffunions admitted, on the basis of certain HUD-verified assumptions, thatHUD's annual Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) costsin the State would increase by 28 percent or $30,200,000; HUD's witnessescalculated the amount at about $50,000,000. In other words, using all availablefunds, HUD's main program for rehabilitating public housing in New Yorkwould have to be slashed by more than one quarter if State rates are imposedon PHA projects there.With respect to the labor organization comments concerning HUD's own studies,two HUD Inspector General reports (Internal Audit: Monitoring and Enforcementof Labor Standards, Region IX, 85-SF-179-0003, January 16, 1985; NationalAudit Report: Monitoring and Enforcement of Labor Standards, 86-TS-179-005,November 6, 1985) stated that there is a correlation between labor standardsviolations and construction deficiencies in the jurisdication of some RegionalOffices. The contractors cited in these reports failed to pay federally-determinedprevailing wage rates. The simple response is that these studies provideno support for the contention that poor quality construction is linkedto failure to pay State-imposed wage rates that exceed federally requiredlevels, since the reports concerned only violations of Federal labor standards.The labor organization also mentioned a HUD Office of Program Planningand Evaluation study (``Evaluation of the High Cost of Indian Housing'',December 1979), which it said indicated a low correlation between averagewage rates and dwelling construction costs. This analysis involved wagerates for projects on 20 reservations. While this report did not find acorrelation between wage rates and overall costs for those projects withthe highest wage rates, it did find some correlation between wage ratesand project costs for the remaining three quarters of the sample with lowerwage rates. In any event, the sample_restricted to a few Indian HousingAuthorities a decade ago_is wholly insufficient to support a conclusionthat high wage rates do not affect construction costs in light of the recent,already recited evidence to the contrary.Other comments relating to the overall cost of a project referred to HUD'ssuggestion that imposition of higher State rates could result in a cutbackby contractors in the cost or quality of equipment and supplies, resultingin poorer quality work. One of the comments, received from a labor organization,suggested that HUD's hypothesis was without factual support and assertedthat the quality of work is largely dependent on the workers' skill andtraining, which would be lacking at the wage rates applying after preemptionof State rates. Another labor organization commented that the contractwill specify the standards of materials required, precluding substitutionof lesser quality by the contractor. HUD's discussion, in the preamble to the proposed rule, of the possibilityof cutbacks in the cost or quality of materials and supplies due to higherState wage rates indicated that this possibility was less likely than thathigher bids must be accepted for the work. Nevertheless, HUD believes thatthe quality of the work is dependent on the skill and workmanship of theworkers_<T3>as well as</T3> the quality of materials. The comment of the New YorkState PHA quoted above regarding cutbacks in quality of materials and qualityof work to be performed is an example_albeit reflected in revised specificationsrather than initiated by a contractor_of lesser quality work resultingfrom imposition of higher State wage rates. Moreover, the labor organizations'comments, along with two other comments asserting that preemption wouldresult in shoddy workmanship due to substandard wages, essentially suggestthat the Federally-determined wage rates (HUD-determined or Davis-Baconrates), are insufficient to protect against unskilled ``bargain basement''workers or resulting poor quality work, not only in the handful of Stateswith higher applicable State rates, but also in the overwhelming majorityof States where Federal rates exeed (or apply in the absence of) State-determinedrates. HUD rejects this assertion as without foundation since the Federally-determinedrates are required by law to reflect rates prevailing in the locality.<ITAG tagnum="84">Accuracy of Federal and State Rates </ITAG>Other comments suggested that HUD and/or Davis-Bacon wage rates are inaccurateor too low. Two comments suggested that preemption of rates determinedunder State law would undermine the labor market; another comment suggestedthat the rule was not in the best interest of the worker and would resultin workers on PHA projects becoming low-income earners. HUD rejects thesecomments because both types of Federal wage rates are required by law toreflect the wage rates prevailing in the locality. Moreover, appeal proceduresare available to challenge Davis-Bacon rates determined by the Departmentof Labor for project development, as well as those determined by HUD forproject operation. Workers and other interested persons, including contractorsand labor organizations, may request that DOL reconsider a Davis-Baconwage determination. Formal appeals may be submitted to the Administrator,Wage and Hour Division. 29 CFR 1.8. The Administrator's decisions may beappealed to the Department of Labor's Wage Appeals Board. 29 CFR 1.9. HUD-determinedwage rates may also be appealed, first to the Regional or Field Office,and then to the Assistant to the Secretary for Labor Relations in Washington,DC. On the other hand, comments from PHAs in New York and California statedthat certain of the State determined wage rates were excessive and unrealistic.HUD notes that State laws vary in their methodology for determining the``prevailing'' wage rate. One recent study characterized that variationamong these laws as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">State prevailing wage laws are highly dissimilar. They are alike onlyin that all of them set some level of super-minimum wage rates for constructionworkers on public works. Even those state prevailing wage laws patternedon the federal Davis-Bacon Act usually contain concepts, definitions, procedures,or rules so changed from the original that no standard form can be saidto exist. The thirty-five little Davis-Bacon acts (those of thirty-fourstates plus that of the District of Columbia) are all effectively different,tied together by little more than a common name. [A. Thieblot, Jr., <T3>Prevailing Wage Legislation: The Davis-Bacon Act, State ``Little Davis-Bacon''Acts, the Walsh-Healey Act, and The Service Contract Act</T3> 137 (LaborRelations and Public Policy Series No. 27, University of Pennsylvania 1986).]</ITAG>The methodology mandated by the New York State labor law, in particular,varies from the DOL methodology for determining Davis-Bacon wage ratesin ways that tend to result in State-determined wage rates that are higherthan the Davis-Bacon rates. As amended in 1983, section 220 of the NewYork State Labor Law defines ``prevailing rate of wage'' as: <ITAG tagnum="20">the rate of wage paid in the locality, as hereinafter defined, byvirtue of collective bargaining agreements between bona fide labor organizationsand employers of the private sector, performing public or private workprovided that said employers employ at least thirty per centum of workers,laborers or mechanics in the same trade or occupation in the locality wherethe work is being performed. The prevailing rate of wage shall be annuallydetermined * * * In the event that it is determined after a contest, asprovided in subdivision six of this section, that less than thirty percentof the workers, laborers or mechanics in a particular trade or occupationin the locality where the work is being performed receive a collectivelybargained rate of wage, then the average wage paid to such workers, laborersor mechanics in the same trade or occupation in the locality for the twelve-monthperiod preceding the fiscal officer's annual determination shall be theprevailing rate of wage. Laborers, workers or mechanics for whom a prevailingrate of wage is to be determined shall not be considered in determiningsuch prevailing wage. [NY Lab. law andSection; 220, subdivision 5a (McKinney)]</ITAG>Only employers may contest a wage determination: <ITAG tagnum="21">An employer may contest a determination by the fiscal officer underparagraphs a and c of subdivision five of this section. The employer mustallege and prove by competent evidence, that the actual percentage of workers,laborers and mechanics is below the required thirty per centum and duringthe pendency of any such contest and until final determination thereof,the work in question shall proceed under the rate established by the fiscalofficer. [<T3>Id.</T3> subdivision 6] </ITAG>As a result of the 1983 amendments, the following differences in methodologybetween New York State and Davis-Bacon wage rates tend to result in higherState-determined wage rates: 1. New York State establishes as prevailing the rates paid to 30 percentof the workers in the trade in the locality if they are subject to collectivebargaining agreements, although the remaining 70 percent of the workersmay be receiving lower wage rates. In contrast, the majority of the workersin a trade must be paid at the same rate in order to establish that rateas prevailing for Federal Davis-Bacon purposes; if the same wage rate isnot paid to a majority, the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage is the averageof the wages paid, weighted by the total employed in the trade. 29 CFR1.2(a)(1). 2. The New York law does not require a survey to determine whether thecollective bargaining agreements considered by the State actually coverat least 30 percent of the workers in the trade, nor does it specify themethodology by which such a survey would be conducted; rather, it placesthe burden on employers to individually challenge wage determinations.Accordingly, it is likely that New York State determinations may representcollectively bargained wage rates paid to <T3>less </T3>than 30 percent of the employees in the locality. 3. In the absence of a separate collectively bargained wage rate for ``residential''structures (apartment buildings of up to four stories) in areas where thereis little or no union activity on this type of construction, the Statewill require payment of the higher collectively bargained ``building''wage rates, although Davis-Bacon wage determinations, as a result of asurvey of local rates and practices, would recognize separate ``residential''wage rates as prevailing for such structures. For these reasons, the New York statute mandates wages that bear littleresemblance to rates determined by the Federal government to prevail inareas where a small percentage of workers in a given trade are subjectto collective bargaining agreements. HUD received two comments concerning Alaska, one suggesting that the preemptionrule would have a devastating effect due to the high cost of living andhigh unemployment there, and the other requesting special considerationfor Alaska because of its significantly higher cost of living and correspondinglyhigher State wage rates. As noted above, however, Federal wage rates arerequired by law to reflect the wage rates already prevailing in the locality.Accordingly, the final rule does not include any special provisions forAlaska. The Massachusetts Secretary of Labor and Commissioner of Labor and Industriesfiled a comment opposing the proposed rule. However, the rule will haveno effect upon Massachusetts, because that State's highest court has ruledthat, in enacting the State prevailing wage law, the legislature did notintend that it apply to federally funded public housing projects. <T3>Commissioner of Labor v. Boston Housing Authority, </T3>345 Mass. 406,188 N.E.2d 150 (1963).<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority to Preempt </ITAG>Several comments addressed HUD's authority for preempting the applicationof State prevailing wage rates on HUD-assisted PHA projects. A few commentssuggested that there is no Congressional intent to preempt State prevailingwage laws or that there is Congressional intent not to preempt those laws.Several comments cited the provision in section 12 of the USHA requiringpayment of ``not less than'' the Federal rates as evidence that the Federalrates are a minimum only; two comments suggested that an amendment to theUSHA in 1949 that for the first time added the ``not less than'' languagewas significant in that it incorporated the ``fundamental'' Davis-Baconconcept that the Federal wages are a floor rather than a ceiling. Thesecomments further suggest that the statutory purpose of the USHA is notfrustrated by the imposition of higher State wage rates. Specifically,they state that nothing in the USHA suggests Congress intended its statutorypurpose to be accomplished at the expense of locally prevailing wage standards;rather, Congress expressly provided that laborers and mechanics on HUD-assistedPHA development and operation are entitled to the local prevailing rate.The comments also refer to the States' long and deep statutory concernabout payment of prevailing wages. A discussion of the legal basis for preemption of higher State-determinedprevailing wage rates on HUD-assisted PHA projects was set out in the preambleto the proposed rule and need not be repeated in detail here. HUD's determinationto preempt higher State wage rates is made under its responsibility tocarry out the Congressional purpose of the USHA as a whole, and is basedon its determination that the imposition of higher State rates on publicand Indian housing projects assisted under the Act conflicts with the Act.The overall purpose of HUD's assistance under the Act is to maintain thelower income character of public and Indian housing projects and assurethat they continue to be available to serve lower income families. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>USHA, sections 5, 9 and 14. The Act also declares thatit is the policy of the United States to employ its funds and credit, asprovided in the Act, to assist the States and their political subdivisionsto ``remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the acuteshortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of lowerincome'' and, consistent with the objectives of the Act, to vest in localPHAs the maximum amount of responsibility in the administration of theirhousing programs. USHA, section 2. The imposition on a project of Statewage rates that exceed the Federally-determined prevailing wage rates establishesan excessive wage floor, and these higher wage costs must ultimately befunded with HUD assistance through the acceptance of higher bids or proposalsor payment of higher wages to PHA or IHA employees. Since Federal fundsare limited, the number of lower income housing units to be constructed,maintained, modernized or repaired is lowered, thus frustrating the purposeof the Act. Another effect of the imposition of higher State wage ratescan be to force a cutback in the cost and quality of materials and suppliesbecause of the greater proportion of project costs required for the laborcomponent, a result equally inimical to the purposes of the USHA. Finally,in providing for locally prevailing wage rates, Congress in section 12of the Act specifically requires a determination or adoption by the <T3>Federal </T3>government of rates reflecting the locally prevailingpractice. To summarize, HUD's basis for preempting State prevailing wage laws isthat application of the State laws conflicts with the requirements of theAct and stands as an obstacle to the execution of the purposes and objectivesof the Act. HUD does not preempt simply because the State laws impose someadditional costs on PHA/IHA projects. Rather, HUD has determined that theaggregate impact of the substantial increase in expenditures resultingfrom application of such laws seriously impairs the Department in dischargingits statutory responsibility to provide and maintain lower income housing.In specific response to the above comments, HUD agrees that Congress didnot intend its statutory purpose to be accomplished at the expense of locallyprevailing labor standards and that Congress explicitly provided for suchstandards. However, Congress' provision in section 12 of the USHA for wagesmeeting such standards specifically requires a determination or adoptionby the <T3>Federal </T3>government of rates reflecting the locally prevailingpractice. Adoption of the rule preempting higher State rates clearly leavesin place the protection of locally prevailing wage standards, determinedor adopted by the respective Federal agencies as Congress required. While there is evidence that Congress in the Davis-Bacon Act and relatedprovisions intended to permit employers (whether as the result of negotiationsor voluntarily) to pay higher than the Federally determined wage rates,HUD is aware of no legislative history indicating that Congress intendedfor the States to be free to compel the payment of such higher rates inFederally-funded PHA/IHA projects. Congressman Bacon of New York, the Davis-BaconAct's sponsor in the House, stated that the Act <ITAG tagnum="20">does not put the Government in the position of price fixing or ofanticipating wage levels * * *. It leaves that to employer and employee,where it belongs. [74 Cong. Rec. at 6511, February 28, 1931]</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Thus, to construe the statute as permitting State-compelled higherrates would not only undercut Congress' grant of express authority to theFederal government to determine prevailing wage rates, but would also interferewith private bargaining which can result in rates higher than the Federally-determinedminimum and lower than the State-mandated rate.HUD recognizes that some States may have long evidenced a statutory concernabout payment of prevailing wages. However, the relative importance toa State of its own law is not material when the state law conflicts withFederal law. See<T3> Felder v. Casey</T3>, 56 USLW 4689, 4791 (1988). In any event, thisrule preempts only those State prevailing wage rates that certain Stateshave made applicable to PHA/IHA projects receiving HUD assistance, andonly to the extent that any of the rates for specific trades on a projectexceed the corresponding Federal wage rates. The rule is narrowly drawnto eliminate the conflict with the USHA that is posed by State mandatingof higher wage floors. States remain free to impose as well as enforceon HUD-assisted PHA/IHA projects those State rates that are equal to orlower than the corresponding Federal wage rates; more importantly, therule in no way affects the States' ability to enforce their own State-mandatedwage rates on the vast majority of State public works projects that isthe subject of the States' traditional concern_<T3>i.e.,</T3> every ``public work'' except Federally-funded PHA/IHA projects.Related to the matter of the States' concern with setting wage rates isthe concept of federalism, which two comments from labor organizationssuggest runs counter to the proposed rule. The comments point out the SupremeCourt's affirmation of the value of permitting each State to be its own``laboratory for experimentation'', and one of the comments cites severalFederal labor standards statutes that explicitly permit or acknowledgethe authority of the States to enact and enforce equivalent or higher standards.The comment also cites the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution (``The powersnot delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibitedby it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to thepeople.''). The concept of federalism is integral to, and not apart from, the determinationof a Federal agency's authority to preempt state law in carrying out itsresponsibility to implement a Federal law that was within the U.S. Congress'sconstitutional authority to enact. Thus the legal basis upon which HUDrelies in preempting higher State wage takes the concept of federalisminto account in determining the permissible scope of preemption. The SupremeCourt, in<T3> Lawrence County v. Lead-Deadwood School District No. 40-1,</T3> 469U.S. 256 (1985), upheld the preemption of a State statute where a Federalstatute provided that a local government recipient of Federal paymentsin lieu of taxes ``may use the payment for any governmental puprose'';the State statute held to be preempted required local governments to distributepayments in lieu of taxes in the same way they distribute general tax revenues,likely resulting in a windfall for entities such as schools that were alreadyfully funded by local revenues. In determining that the statute was preempted,the Supreme Court rejected ``federalism'' arguments opposing Federal intrusioninto a State's efforts to provide fiscal guidance to its subdivisions,and noted that under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, Congressmay impose conditions on the receipt of Federal funds absent some independentconstitutional bar. There is no area in which the State's police and health-and-welfareauthority is greater than in connection with its schools, or in which itscore government functions are greater than in providing fiscal directionto its local governmental subdivisions. Nonetheless, in<T3> Lead-Deadwood</T3>, the Supreme Court determined that a State lawmandating the manner of revenue allocation by its subdivisions, and clearlydesigned, from the State's perspective, to benefit school systems in countiesreceiving aid in lieu of taxes, was preempted. Thus, even if wage and hourstandards are viewed as areas of traditional State concern, the resultin<T3> Lead-Deadwood</T3> indicates this matters not in considering whetherthe Federal goal of providing an adequate supply of lower-income housingwould be frustrated by imposition of higher State wage rates, or in determiningthat Federal preemption is a legitimate response to such frustration. HUD notes that the fact that Congress has, in other labor standards statutes,permitted a State to enact or enforce equal or stricter standards doesnot suggest that the same applies to the USHA, where Congress has<T3> not</T3> provided for higher State wage rates. Congress' principalpurpose in enacting the USHA was to remedy an acute shortage of decent,safe and sanitary lower income housing, maintain the lower income characterof PHA and IHA projects and assure their continued availability to servelower income families. Application of State-compelled wage rates wouldclearly frustrate this purpose. A State agency comment questioned HUD's authority to override State wageand hour laws by regulation. As discussed in the preamble to the proposedrule, HUD's preemption in the narrow circumstances set out in the ruleis authorized where State law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishmentand execution of the purposes of the USHA, and in those circumstances theU.S. Supreme Court has indicated that Federal regulations have no lesspreemptive effect than Federal statutes, regardless of express Congressionalauthorization to displace State law. Another State agency commenting in opposition to the proposed rule citedCongress' desire to preserve as much local autonomy as possible, as evidencedby the statement in section 2 of the USHA that one of the Act's purposeswas ``to vest in local public housing agencies the maximum amount of responsibilityin the administration of their housing programs'' (42 U.S.C. 1437) andby a 1949 Senate report stating that ``the primary responsibility for theprovision of low rent housing is in the hands of the various localities''with a limited Federal role. Vesting of the maximum amount of responsibility in PHAs is unquestionablyone of the policies of the Act. Contrary to the comment, however, thisCongressional policy supports, rather than conflicts with, the preemptionof State-mandated wage rates, which<T3> furthers</T3> the goal of local autonomy. Moreover, the overwhelminglyfavorable comments from PHAs support this view. Preemption under the proposedrule would<T3> eliminate</T3> requirements imposed by the State on the local PHA/IHA.One PHA in New York State commented that ``[t]his proposed rule shouldbe considered as an additional step towards decontrol [of PHAs].'' Anothercommented that while, from their observation, the difference in wage scaleswas minimal, these mandates have caused serious and controversial negotiationswith contractors, delays in getting programs started and an ``overall nuisance''in the bidding process. In any event, HUD notes that the policy of vestingthe maximum amount of responsibility in local PHAs is established by section2 of the USHA only to the extent ``consistent with the objectives of thisAct.'' There is no conflict with this policy in a rule which preempts Staterequirements that are inconsistent with the stated goal of remedying theacute shortage of lower income housing. One State agency commented that under the law of the State, the agencyis required to bring suit to enjoin the award of a contract, or any furtherwork or payments thereunder where the contract is already awarded, if apublic authority has not included a schedule of the (State) prevailingwages in its contracts for public works. The State agency suggested thatthe proposed rule would therefore lead to an expensive and time-consuminglegal battle that would defeat HUD's objectives by causing delays and additionallegal costs. HUD notes that the rule does not direct the PHA/IHA to physicallyexclude State wage rates from the contract; the contract must, however,indicate that any State rates that exceed the Federal rates are inapplicableto the contract and unenforceable. Assuming, however, that the State lawwould still otherwise require some State legal enforcement action in thesecircumstances, the rule would prohibit enforcement of preempted State requirementswhether or not they were included in the contract. There shoyld not beany expensive and time-consuming State challenges because the rule wouldpreempt any State law that would require legal action or other enforcementof the higher State rates, as a matter of law, thereby eliminating theasserted duty under State law to bring suit to enjoin contract award orwork or payments under the contract.A labor organization comment asserted that HUD does not allege an inherentconflict between the Federal and State laws in question, but rather a conflictby virtue of the manner in which the prevailing wage provisions of therespective statutes are interpreted and applied, and that the labor organizationknew of no reported case involving preemption on the grounds that the respectiveregulatory schemes were not harmonious under the particular facts of aspecific case. As indicated above, HUD believes there is an inherent conflicthere between the Federal and State laws. Moreover, HUD notes that thiscomment cites no case suggesting that preemption is warranted only wherean obstacle to the accomplishment of the Federal statutory purpose is ``inherent''in the State and Federal laws, but is unwarranted where the same obstacleresults from the manner in which the respective statutes are interpretedand applied. In fact, a recent Supreme Court case repeats the establishedrule that preemption may be based upon the <T3>effect</T3> a State law, neutral on its face, has upon a Federal objective.<T3>Felder </T3>v.<T3> Casey, </T3>56 USLW 4689 (1988). The effect of State laws that prescribehigher-than-Federal wage rates is to divert funds from the provision ormaintenance of a greater number of lower income housing units to the paymentof higher wages and thus obstruct the Federal objective.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Effect on Competition  </ITAG>Several comments concerned the proposed rule's effect on competition. TheChief Counsel for Advocacy of U.S. Small Business Administration commentedthat if HUD believes the impact of the rule is not expected to be significantin terms of both the number of small entities affected and the magnitudeof the expected savings, HUD's Regulatory Flexibility Act certificationaccompanying the final rule should at least recognize that the changesbrought about by the rule will clearly be beneficial to small businesses.The Chief Counsel stated that regulatory reform which reduces disparitiescaused by artificially inflated wage determinations can reasonably be expectedto encourage greater small business participation in bidding on PHA projects,since many small firms have foregone bidding on public projects becauseof dislike for having to maintain a two-tier wage system with ``higherwages for regulated projects and competitive wages on private projects''.A trade association commented that the proposed rule is a step toward makingthe procurement process more competitive and would encourage more subcontractors,the overwhelming majority of which are small businesses, to take part.Another trade association commented that individual state laws are creatingdeterminations of ``prevailing'' wages that are not true ongoing wagesin a locality, and that such laws discriminate against small contractorsbecause they are unable to compete with the capabilities and resourcesof larger firms to comply with such ``inflated'' rates and their paperworkrequirements. Five PHAs also indicated that the proposed rule would stimulatecompetition. On the other hand, as noted earlier, a labor organizationin New York State commented that the proposed rule would have an adverseeffect on competition in bidding on PHA work by effectively precludingcontractors that are parties to collective bargaining agreements from competitivebidding for such work, since in general the wage rate determined underNew York law is the collectively bargained rate.  HUD recognizes that when a State law designates a collectively bargainedwage rate as prevailing in a locality and the Federal government determinesthat a lower wage rate prevails, some contractors that are contractuallybound to pay at the level of the State-determined wage rates would be competitivelydisadvantaged, since their labor costs would be reflected in an overallhigher bid on the job, as the comment of the New York labor organizationsuggests. This may be an unavoidable effect on preempting State laws thatwould otherwise require HUD to fund excessive wage floors through the acceptanceof higher bids or proposals for PHA work. In any event, the other commentscited support HUD's conclusion that the overall effect of the rule wouldbe to increase competition because it would lead to a net increase in thenumber of firms willing to bid on PHA/IHA work at the Federally determinedwage rates once higher State wage rates are preempted.<ITAG tagnum="85">Proposals for Alternatives and Modifications to the Proposed Rule</ITAG>Several comments suggested modifications or alternatives to the proposedrule or requested clarifications of the rule. Several PHAs in Californiaand a regional association commented that the final rule should clarifywhether or not Department of Labor (DOL) wage rates include fringe benefits,and the effect of these benefits upon the issued wage rate, <T3>i.e., </T3>whether their value is in addition to, apart from, or tobe subtracted from the Davis-Bacon wage rate. In the context of this rule, DOL wage rates are the ``Davis-Bacon'' wagerates. Davis-Bacon wage rates include fringe benefits where DOL determinesthat more than 50 percent of the employees in the craft in the localityreceive fringe benefits; in other areas Davis-Bacon wage rates do not includeany fringe benefits and reflect only the prevailing basic hourly rate.See, U.S. Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wageand Hour Division, <T3>Davis-Bacon Construction Wage Determinations Manual of Operations </T3>63-65(1986). Davis-Bacon wage rates that include fringe benefits so indicateand Federal law and regulations require that the fringe benefits must beprovided or the hourly monetary equivalent listed in the DOL wage determinationmust be added to the basic hourly rate paid to the workers. HUD believesit is unnecessary for the final rule to include this explanation of whatDavis-Bacon/DOL rates contain, however, because each DOL wage decisionitself indicates whether fringe benefits are included in the wages thatmust be paid. As the proposed rule and its preamble indicated, State wagerates would be preempted on work that is subject to Davis-Bacon wage ratesif the total State wage rate_including fringe benefits, if any, as wellas basic hourly rate_exceeds the total DOL wage rate_including fringe benefits,if any, and basic hourly rate. The final rule has not been changed in thisregard. Thus, where a State rate includes fringe benefits and the DOL ratedoes not (because DOL has determined that fringe benefits do not prevailfor that trade in that locality), the total State rate including fringebenefits will be compared to the basic hourly rate determined by DOL tobe prevailing, and will be preempted if it exceeds the DOL rate. The same PHAs also commented that the issue of wage rates for apprenticesand the ratio of apprentices to journeymen should also be addressed inthe final rule. In addition, a New York State PHA commented that HUD, inconjunction with DOL and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, shouldconsider preemption of New York State Labor Law section 220 to the extentthat it precludes the payment of lower-than-journeyman State-determinedwage rates to trainees enrolled under Federally-approved trainee programs.The PHA cited the case of <T3>Monarch Electrical Contracting Corporation v. Roberts, </T3>510 N.E.2d795, 517 NYS.2d 711, 70 NY2d 91 (NY Ct. of App. 1987), in which the Courtof Appeals of New York held that section 220 recognized only two categoriesof workers_journeymen and State-registered apprentices_thus precludingpayment of apprentice-level wage rates to trainees notwithstanding theirparticipation in a U.S. DOL-registered trainee program. The court in thatcase indicated that the trainee program was functionally equivalent toan apprenticeship program but was designed in its entrance requirementsto promote minority group participation, and invited the legislature toreexamine section 220, noting that its application ``unexpectedly frustratesthe very important policy of reducing discrimination in the workplace.''Apprentice and trainee wage rates and the allowable ratio of apprenticesor trainees to journeymen are not set out in Davis-Bacon wage determinations;they are set out in the apprenticeship program approved by the DOL Bureauof Apprenticeship and Training or a State Apprenticeship Agency recognizedby the Bureau, or in the trainee program certified by the DOL Employmentand Training Administration, although States may also legislate ratios.Apprentice and trainee wage rates are generally expressed as percentagesof the DOL determined (journeymen) Davis-Bacon rate. The proposed ruledid not address the issue of apprentice or trainee ratios because HUD didnot intend to preempt State non-wage labor standards. In any event, HUDdoes not view as a significant difficulty the possibility that a State-legislatedratio might allow a lower proportion of apprentices or trainees than therelevant apprenticeship or trainee program. Accordingly, the final ruleis unchanged in this regard. With regard to the wage rates of apprentices and trainees, the final rulehas been clarified in response to the above comments by referring explicitlyto wage rates for apprentices and trainees under approved programs (inaddition to the DOL-determined rates) on work that is subject to Davis-Baconwage rates. One PHA requested clarification as to whether other funds used in the developmentor operation of a public housing project, such as Community DevelopmentBlock Grant, Emergency Shelter Grant or other HUD program funds, FarmersHome Administration funds, or State and local funds, would be subject tothe preemption rule. HUD does not intend that higher State wage rates be preempted unless thework in question is assisted in whole or in part with assistance for lowerincome public housing under the USHA. Thus, for example, modernizationwork funded in part with CIAP funds under section 14 of the USHA and inpart with State funds would be subject to the preemption provisions ofthe rule; however, HUD does not intend that work on HUD-assisted publichousing would be subject to preemption of State wage rates if the workin question is assisted entirely by, <T3>e.g., </T3>State funds, Community Development Block Grant funds, orprivate donations. Accordingly, in those parts of the regulations thatotherwise cover work that may receive no HUD assistance for public housingunder the USHA (Parts 905 and 965), the final rule has been revised toexclude such non-USHA assisted work from the preemption provisions; norevision has been made in this regard to the final rule provisions in Parts941 and 968, since those parts only cover work that is at least partiallyassisted with USHA assistance for public housing. HUD notes that section12 of the USHA requires the payment of at least HUD-determined rates inthe operation of the project and Davis-Bacon rates in the development ofthe project, without regard to the source of funds for the specific workinvolved. The same PHA suggested that all HUD programs be subject to the preemptionrule, and that the Community Development Block Grant and Emergency ShelterGrant programs were also intended to be administered in an efficient andeconomical answer to assure assistance to the greatest number of low incomefamilies. HUD has not adopted this suggestion because it is beyond thescope of this rulemaking, which is limited to work on public housing projectsthat are receiving assistance under the public housing programs of theUSHA. Two New York State PHAs commented that the rule should be expanded to preemptNew York State Housing Law section 32, which requires the compensationfixed by the PHA for its officers, agents and employees to be approvedby the local legislative body. The argument for such preemption was thatsome local governments may not be willing to approve salaries guaranteeingthe best qualified workers. HUD presumes that section 32 is intended to govern compensation for executiveand administrative PHA personnel rather than laborers and mechanics whomay be subject to the New York State prevailing wage law. The issue ofcompensation for executive and administrative personnel is outside thescope of this rule. HUD notes that such compensation has long been addressedby a provision in the Annual Contributions Contract between HUD and a PHA,which requires adoption of a statement of personnel policies, includingsalary and wage rates, that are comparable with pertinent local publicpractice.One PHA commented that if the proposed rule is adopted, HUD must take intoconsideration local market conditions, trends, and adjustments in Stateswith prevailing wage statutes in order to compete with trades that mightbe drawn away as a result of a higher wage scale in a specific trade. AnotherPHA, while supporting the rule, suggested the possibility of not receivingan adequate number of well qualified bidders on construction projects dueto lower wage rates. HUD believes no modification to the proposed ruleis warranted in this regard for two reasons. First, adoption of the ruleleaves Federal wage rates, which are by definition a determination of theprevailing wage rates, applicable to PHA work. Second, this rule does notimpose a cap on what PHAs or contractors may choose to pay their employees.A housing and redevelopment association proposed several modificationsto the rule. First, the association stated that various pressures couldforce PHAs to continue to pay (higher) State determined rates even withpreemption in place, <T3>e.g., </T3>because city and State funds will also be used on the projector because contracts and workers could be lost to competition with localgovernment's housing construction or modernization. The association suggestedthat in these situations, PHAs should be provided a special waiver or anassurance that HUD will allow the costs of paying the State wages. HUD believes no modification to this rule to include a special waiver isnecessary. A State law that requires State-determined prevailing wage rateson public housing projects in general applies with no less force when solelyFederal funds are used than when a mixture of Federal and State or cityfunds is used to carry out specific work on a HUD-assisted project, andthe preemptive force of this rule is the same in both cases. However, neitherthe prevailing wage provisions of section 12 of the USHA nor this ruleprecludes a PHA (or its contractors) from paying rates higher than theFederally-determined prevailing wage for the locality. For purposes of clarifying this point, HUD has decided to add provisionsto the rule to state explicitly that the rule will not affect the applicabilityof wage rates established in collective bargaining agreements where therates equal or exceed the Federal wage rate, nor does the rule impose aceiling on wage rates the PHA or IHA or its contractors or subcontractorsmay choose to pay independent of State law. With regard to HUD allowanceof the costs of paying the State wages, HUD budgetary review is not governedby this rule; PHA and IHA operating budgets are reviewed in accordancewith outstanding instructions, and the provision added to this final ruledoes not imply automatic HUD allowance of all wage expenses. Second, the association, noting that PHAs and IHAs would not be requiredto pay their own employees at the higher State rates, asserts that therule could create personnel problems for employers which would be ``forcedto reduce salaries of employees if in fact they begin to pay the lower[Federal] wage rate to others in the same classification.'' The associationsuggests grandfathering current employees into this rule change. HUD hasnot adopted this suggestion. While the rule would make higher State wagerates no longer mandatory or enforceable, nothing in the rule legally ``forces''PHAs or IHAs to reduce wages to no more than the Federal prevailing wagelevel, nor does HUD have any general administrative policy that would forcesuch a result. Finally, the association commented that it strongly supported the statementin the preamble to the proposed rule that applicability of wage rates establishedin collective bargaining agreements with a PHA or its contractors willnot be affected by the rule, regardless of whether those rates equal orexceed rates determined under State or Federal law; however, the associationurged that this provision be spelled out in the rule itself and clarifiedto state that: (1) It pertains to any current or future agreements and(2) under such circumstances, HUD will recognize cost differences betweenState and Federal requirements as an eligible expenditure. As discussed above, in response to this comment and another of the association'scomments, HUD has decided to incorporate a provision into each of the sectionsof the rule to the effect that the rule shall not affect the applicabilityof wage rates established in collective bargaining agreements with a PHAor IHA or its contractors or subcontractors where such wage rates exceedthe applicable Federal wage rate. HUD believes it is clear that these provisionspertain to current and future agreements. HUD has also added a clause indicatingthat the rule does not impose a ceiling on wages the PHA or IHA or itscontractors or subcontractors may choose to pay independent of State law;this provision would apply in the absence of collectively bargained wagerates. As to recognition of eligible expenditures, that issue (which appearslimited to wages paid by PHAs and IHAs to their own employees) is not thesubject of the regulation sections added by this rule. In any event, theproper measure of costs for which the association requests recognitionis not the difference between State and Federal rates, but the actual differencebetween the collectively bargained rates and the Federal rates. However,the Department is not willing to commit unconditionally to recognize suchcost differences as an eligible expenditure in all cases. A New York State PHA commented that the rule should be amended to applya residential wage rate to all housing projects and that such rate shouldbe issued by DOL. HUD cannot adopt either suggestion in this rule. First,the application of residential rates (as opposed to ``building'' rates)under the Davis-Bacon related acts, which is generally limited to workon residential structures of up to four stories, is a matter for determinationby DOL and not HUD. Second, Section 12 of the USHA gives HUD, rather thanDOL, the authority to determine prevailing wage rates for work involvedin the operation of a public housing project (including routine and non-routinemaintenance work), as opposed to development of the project which is subjectto Davis-Bacon rates. A Washington State PHA commented that PHAs need to be exempted from theState prevailing wage law, since without a complete exclusion the Staterates must be requested and included in the bid documents, the contractormust accurately distinguish among the wage exhibits that which will apply,and the general contractor must submit for itself and its subcontractors``Intent to Pay Prevailing Wages'' documents and ``Affidavits of WagesPaid'' at $12.50 each payable by the PHA. HUD has not adopted this suggestionbecause HUD does not view inclusion of State-determined prevailing ratesthat are equal to or lower than Federal wage rates as an obstacle to thepurposes of the USHA; accordingly, HUD does not view State monitoring andenforcement of such State rates as in conflict with the USHA. However,HUD notes that the rule provides that State prevailing rates may not beenforced against contractors or subcontractors. To the extent that theState rates on a project exceed the corresponding Federal rates, HUD takesthe position that it would be contrary to this provision in the rule fora State to require a contractor to submit a statement that it intends topay the higher State rate.<ITAG tagnum="85">Comparison of Certain State Wage Rates to Federally-Determined WageRates</ITAG>The preamble to the proposed rule did not provide examples of the differencesbetween Federally-determined prevailing wage rates and State-determinedwage rates in the State of Washington.
