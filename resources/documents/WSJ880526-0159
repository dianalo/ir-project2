That's the advice of Robert Half, founder of Robert Half International Inc., a world-wide financial and data-processing recruiting firm. Mr. Half says that a resume is a job seeker's advertisement and &quot;we all know that many ads are misleading, some bordering on outright lying.&quot;    In an article in the latest issue of Management Accounting, a monthly publication of the National Association of Accountants based in Montvale, N.J., Mr. Half estimates that 30% of job candidates lie in their resumes.    The more a candidate uses vivid colors, unusual size paper and other gimmicks on his resume, the weaker the candidate's work background, says Mr. Half. Beware of the &quot;cookie-cutter, too-slick look&quot; of a resume, he warns. &quot;An employer has to be wary of someone who's allowed others to put words in his or her mouth.&quot;    Resumes without job dates generally hide job-hopping and use of such phrases as &quot;some experience in&quot; or &quot;knowledge of&quot; may show lack of hands-on experience, says Mr. Half.    Should a candidate without a resume be disqualified? Not necessarily, says Mr. Half. &quot;Sometimes the hottest candidates haven't had a chance to prepare one.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
