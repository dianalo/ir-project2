The hitch comes seven months after a consortium led by Norway's national oil company, Statoil, signed the agreement to provide Austria's state-owned OMV AG with about one billion cubic meters of natural gas annually for 20 years, starting in 1993. The terms of the Austrian contract parallel those obtained by Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands in June 1986, when they signed a 20-year, $64 billion contract to buy gas from Norway's huge Sleipner and Troll gas fields.    In signing the contract with Austria, Statoil intended to arrange transmission from its terminal facilities on West Germany's northern coast through lines owned by Ruhrgas AG. But the German company has objected. &quot;Ruhrgas isn't a transport service,&quot; a senior Ruhrgas spokesman said. &quot;We buy and sell natural gas and don't simply transmit gas for third parties.&quot;    Instead, Ruhrgas proposed to buy the gas from Statoil for resale to Austria, a plan that Norway and Austria oppose. Both note that the natural-gas contract calls for Statoil to deliver the gas to Austria's border. The pact would have to be renegotiated entirely, probably with different pricings, if Ruhrgas insisted on stepping into the transaction, they said. </TEXT></DOC>
