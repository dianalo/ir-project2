BTU reduction ingas plants is simply the difference, in BTUs, in thermal content betweenthe inlet gas stream and the outlet, or residue, gas stream as determinedby measurement or calculation. BTU based allocation of gas plant productionis relatively new to gas processing contracts and is particularly importanttoday in that virtually all gas purchase contracts are based on dekatherms(MM BTUs) instead of volumetric (MCF) contracts that were common in thepast. In plant BTU reduction determination and allocation, the transportingpipeline sees no difference in physical residue gas quality, althoughthe disbursement of gas purchase payments or transportation charges arealtered to reflect differences in each processor's residue dekatherms.Natural gas produced from various onshore and offshore wells is routinelytransported via intrastate and/or interstate pipelines to its ultimatedestination or market. Natural gas that is transported within these pipelinesis typically a mixture of inerts, (nitrogen and carbon dioxide), methane(the main component of natural gas), and C/sub 2/ to C/sub 9/ parrafinhydrocarbons (NGLs).</TEXT></DOC>
