At a breakfast meeting yesterday with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Reilly specifically said he anticipates industry efforts to reduce the scope of the auto alternative-fuels program and to remove a provision that would cap utilities' emissions of sulfur dioxide, a rule that could limit their growth. He said that the emissions cap faces particular opposition in the House and that he is aware that even some sponsors of the administration's bill believe it is too tough on utilities.    Mr. Reilly, contending that industry opposition to the emissions measure hasn't softened, disputed charges by lawmakers and environmental groups that significant concessions were made to business groups during the drafting of the bill. &quot;We've seen very strong concern and opposition from the energy industry. We've seen a somewhat ambivalent but generally negative view from the auto industry on alternatve fuels,&quot; he said.    At the same time, he said, environmentalists have a good chance of winning tougher standards for auto tailpipe emissions and of succeeding in doubling the required warranty on pollution equipment to 100,000 miles per car. Proponents of tougher auto standards gained some ground yesterday when eight Northeastern states agreed to adopt tougher auto emissions rules than the Bush administration is proposing.    Moreover, a top General Motors Corp. executive yesterday expressed support for the president's proposal. In a speech at an automotive conference in Michigan, Gary W. Dickinson, a GM vice president, said that while the Bush plan will be tough for the industry to meet, &quot;on balance it is more realistic than any of the alternatives pending in Congress.&quot;    While GM's backing will likely shore up the support of Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), a key sponsor of the legislation, it will also reinforce the perception of environmental groups and other lawmakers that the plan is too soft on the auto industry.    Still, Mr. Reilly said he expects that whatever emerges will be based largely on the president's proposal, noting that the measure has already attracted support from a coalition of moderate Democrats and Republicans. &quot;These bills are not that far apart,&quot; he said, referring to other clean-air proposals in Congress. Lawmakers have predicted that a clean-air measure will pass sometime next year.    Mr. Reilly asserted that Rep. Henry Waxman's (D., Calif.) more stringent approach on reducing smog, which would demand greater pollution reductions from the auto industry, would bring only 2% a year in additional pollution reduction compared with Mr. Bush's smog proposal, but would cost $6 billion more a year. He estimated that the administration's smog provision, the bill's most expensive section, would represent $8 billion to $13 billion of the measure's total annual cost to business. That total annual cost is estimated at $14 billion to $19 billion.    Mr. Reilly said there might be an acid rain compromise struck -- for example, between Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine -- to save high-sulfur coal mining jobs by requiring some coal-fired utilities to install scrubbers. Scrubbers would allow plants to continue burning high-sulfur coal more cleanly. Mr. Bush's bill is styled to give utilities flexibility to switch to cleaner fuels or to cut emissions in other ways.    Another vulnerable provision, he suggested, is the administration's proposal to allow utilities to trade or sell credits earned from reducing emissions below new federal standards. Mr. Reilly said he expects considerable opposition to this provision from some environmental groups.    Arguing that the administration measure wasn't weakened during drafting, Mr. Reilly defended a provision that would allow auto makers to average emissions, a provision that he said has been widely misunderstood. He explained that averaging of tailpipe emissions would be allowed within each engine family rather than across entire fleets, which, he said, would allow auto makers additional flexibility while still reducing the amount of pollution.    &quot;There's nothing to fear from averaging,&quot; he said. &quot;That's a false charge against us.&quot;    Separately, Mr. Reilly plans to meet today with top officials of nine companies with polluting plants that EPA officials say pose some of the biggest health risks in the country. He intends to try to persuade them to cut voluntarily their emissions of toxic chemicals, even before new requirements are put in place. EPA officials describe the meeting as part of an experimental strategy to solicit voluntary industry cooperation in the face of recent data showing excessively high amounts of toxic air emissions.    William Fay, chief lobbyist on clean-air legislation for a coalition of major industries, argued, however, that there is a disincentive for companies to make voluntary reductions when there isn't a guarantee they will get credit for them when a clean-air law is enacted.    Expected at the session are officials from Occidental Chemical Corp., Exxon Chemical, Texas Olefins, Texaco Chemical Co., GE Plastics, Dow Chemical USA, Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co., BASF Corp., Reichhold Chemicals Inc. and the Chemical Manufacturers Association.    The Northeast states seeking to toughen auto standards plan to propose the adoption of requirements as stringent as those in California. The program would include stiffer exhaust standards, a 100,000-mile warranty for pollution-control equipment and a more aggressive vehicle-recall program, among other provisions.    Michael J. Bradley, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, said in a prepared statement that the program would increase the cost of a new car by about $150. The states in the program are Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.    If these states and California have auto-pollution standards that are stiffer than the national standard, that could increase pressure on lawmakers to adopt a single standard nationwide as tough as that of these states.    Chrysler Corp. called the Northeast states' plan &quot;premature,&quot; saying that the best way to accomplish clean-air goals is to enact federal legislation. </TEXT></DOC>
