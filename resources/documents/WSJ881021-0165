Likewise they curb investment in plant modernization. Among the other burdens, the high cost of servicing government debt is the most conspicuous. Now, the election campaign could be an opportunity to challenge and reshape some ideas which keep interest rates high.    Time and again the Federal Reserve System tightens credit when economic growth gathers momentum. Because of fear from inflation the price of money is raised. The rationale is that higher interest rates will slow economic growth, which in turn will prevent &quot;demand -- pull&quot; inflation. But actually, raising the price of credit triggers &quot;cost-push&quot; inflation as much or even more than it halts demand-pull inflation. Conventional wisdom pretends not to recognize that cost-push type inflation can be prompted by overpriced money, quite similarly to overpriced labor, energy or other factors of production. To compound the irony, in reaction to rising interest rates, the supply may shift backward more substantially than demand.    Keeping interest rates high to restrain economic growth is a dubious strategy in the fight against inflation. Whenever economic growth occurs, it expands not only demand but also supply. Essentially, growth is the process through which additional supply is produced while additional income is earned. People earn no additional income before participating in the enhancement of supply.    The makers of monetary policy overlook the reality that supply expansion does pressure the price level downward. Any upward price pressures, attributable to demand increase, are countered by the downward price pressures of increased supply. More goods are chasing the money in circulation. Keynesian thought still holds that laborious aggregate demand management constitutes the heart of stabilization policy. Monetary policy is conducted as during the heydays of the Phillips curve, pretending to trade off unemployment and inflation. Also disregarded is evidence from the past 20 years: More often than not, inflation and unemployment move up or down simultaneously. The &quot;misery index&quot; (inflation plus unemployment rates) is around 8% to 9% today instead of the 20% to 22% that it was a decade ago.    The Federal Reserve believes its mandate of macroeconomic stabilization is &quot;to lean against the prevailing winds.&quot; But quite often the Fed leans against imaginary winds that in reality are the enlivening breeze of the market. Thus the Phantom fighting Fed curbs production and also triggers an unwanted chain reaction. Supply restraint feeds unemployment, widens the government budget deficit, reduces saving, worsens balance-of-payment deficit, augurs international financial crises, etc. Another burden is eroding competitiveness, which results from diverting entrepreneurial talents away from the pursuit of efficient production toward defending the status quo, scheming alternative scenarios, and guessing out the Fed.    The election season of 1988, if the candidates set their mind to it, could still bring about breakthroughs in economic policy. The Fed may begin to correct its distorted view that good news is bad news. True, obsolete theories fade slowly, be they adherence to institutional rigidities or the propensity to fine tune by the central bank. But examples through history abound that growth did propel supply increases and, consequently, downward price adjustments followed. Today, if stale ideology would cease to obscure reality, simultaneous reductions in the unemployment rate and in the price level could receive reinforcement from sustained economic growth.
