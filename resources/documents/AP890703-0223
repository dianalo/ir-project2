However, Dotson's lawyer argued that the technology he says willexonerate his client has only been available for a few years.   Dotson was convicted of raping Cathleen Crowell Webb andsentenced to a 25- to 50-year prison term.   But in 1985, Ms. Webb recanted her testimony against him in acase that drew nationwide attention.   Gov. James R. Thompson granted Dotson clemency, saying hispunishment had been sufficient. The governor, however, said he didnot believe the recantation, and has refused to pardon Dotson.   Dotson attorney Thomas Breen's bid for a retrial is based onrecent genetic tests that the attorney says prove Dotson was not Ms.Webb's assailant.   Assistant State's Attorney Gayle Shines said Dotson's right toask for a retrial expired two years after his conviction, eventhough the genetic tests were not available then.   Circuit Judge Thomas R. Fitzgerald continued the hearing untilJuly 24, saying he needed more time to study the matter.   Dotson, 32, remains in an alcoholism treatment center as acondition of his parole last August. He had been returned to prisonin December 1987 for a parole violation.   Since his 1985 release, Dotson has had recurring problems withthe law.</TEXT></DOC>
