About 5,000 radical students and dissidents marched in freezingweather, calling for the arrest and punishment of ex-president ChunDoo-hwan for abuses under his authoritarian rule.   Protesters hurled firebombs and rocks in clashes with some of the15,000 riot police who flooded the city.   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan! Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' enraged protestersyelled.   Several police officers were set on fire by firebombs, but policehad no word on casualties or arrests.   Radical groups, which have little public backing, have beentrying to use the Chun issue to generate opposition to the Rohgovernment. Onlookers showed few signs of support for the radicalsSaturday and the march appeared smaller than protests last week.   Roh appealed on television for an end to the crisis surroundingChun and asked for mercy for the former president, who went intointernal exile Wednesday after apologizing for corruption and otherabuses under his government.   Chun, a former general who stepped down in February after aseven-year term, said he was surrendering all his property,including about $24 million. But he has denied any personalcorruption.   Roh, also an ex-general and former ally of Chun, promised tocorrect past government abuses and shake up the administration toremove vestiges of the Chun era.   ``I will liquidate past wrongdoings and carry out bold reforms inthe government and governing party in the quest of a new era,'' hesaid.   Roh stopped short of granting Chun a pardon but said anyprosecution of the former ruler would be unfair politicalretribution.   ``When he himself apologized deeply, how can we stone the formerpresident alone on the grounds that there were many mistakes in thepast?'' Roh said.   Opposition parties immediately rejected Roh's appeal, saying Chunshould be investigated by the National Assembly and a specialprosecutor. Radical groups called for Roh's removal from office andsome demanded Chun commit suicide.   ``Chun Doo-hwan is a coward who asks for forgiveness instead oftaking his own life to atone for his crimes,'' dissident leader PaikKi-wan told a rally.   Paik urged people to march on the Blue House presidentialmansion. Riot police, dressed in green combat fatigues and blackvisored helmets, blocked the way. Students hurled scores offirebombs and rocks before being driven off by police armored vansfiring volleys of tear gas.   Protesters burned an effigy draped in the U.S. flag. Speakerssaid Roh and Chun were American puppets and demanded an end to U.S.ties.   ``Drive out Yankees!'' protesters chanted.   Small, peaceful anti-Chun protests were also reported in theprovincial cities of Pusan, Chunchon, Taegu, Taejon and Andong.   Roh said he will grant amnesty to political prisoners jailedunder Chun, who took power in 1980 with military backing. Roh alsopromised to restore the civil rights of prisoners already freed.   Government officials said the cases of 266 prisoners convicted ofpolitical offenses or facing trial were being reviewed and manywould be freed around Dec. 10. Opposition parties contend there areabout 1,000 political prisoners.   Roh also promised compensation for victims of the 1980 uprisingin the southern city of Kwangju and other people killed or dismissedfor political reasons under Chun. About 200 people died when thearmy suppressed the uprising.</TEXT></DOC>
