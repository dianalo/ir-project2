By the end of 1992, the EEC plans to ``perfect its internalmarket and remove further obstacles to the free movement of people,goods, services and capital between the member countries,'' saysErnest Koenig of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.   ``Although complete integration may be years away, the plannedsteps in that direction may conflict with U.S. interests,'' he said.``Tax, labor, business and investment regulations in a singleEuropean market undoubtedly will favor (EEC) members.''   To what extent such regulations and preferences will affect theUnited States and other EEC trading partners is unknown at this time.   The move toward an integrated Europe has not met with unanimousapproval within the bloc. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatchersays she can never accept a United States of Europe.   Although Mrs. Thatcher favors removing barriers that restrictfree trade, whe wants EEC borders to remain for security reasons anddoes not want a single market to lead to a monetary union with asingle currency and a central bank after 1992.   But France, West Germany and the nine other countries say the EECmust head for that goal if it is to compete effectively with Japanand the United States.   If there is uncertainty about 1992 and the years after, there islittle doubt about the position of the EEC in today's world trade.And there is no mistaking that the 12-nation bloc _ even if has someold aches and pains _ can flex plenty of muscle.   According to a USDA study several years ago, the 12-member EEChad a population of about 320 million, with 11 million employed inagriculture in 1984. Those represented 8.9 percent of the EEC'scivilian employment.   In the United States, with a much smaller population,agricultural employment was 3.32 million in 1984, or 3.2 percent oftotal civilian employment.   The EEC had 9.8 million farms in 1984, averaging only 42 acreseach, compared with 2.3 million farms averaging 438 acres.   A major complaint of U.S. trade people has involved the EEC'sprotective import system and readiness to subsidize exports as a wayof getting rid of surplus production. For years, the United Stateshas sought freer world trade and has complained often about EECpolicies.   One of the fears of U.S. trade experts and American producers isthat the situation may worsen instead of improve with the coming ofthe 1992 plan. There would be much to lose.   Recent trade figures speak for themselves. In the fiscal yearthat ended last Sept. 30, U.S. agricultural exports totaled $35.3billion. Of the total, shipments to EEC countries were valued atmore than $7.5 billion.   Collectively, the EEC is the largest foreign market for Americanfarmers. Japan, at $7.27 billion last year, is the biggestsingle-country buyer.   Koenig, writing in a new issue of AgExporter, the successor toForeign Agriculture magazine, said that the United States hasencouraged EEC integration but ``has stated repeatedly its concernfor fair treatment of non-members.''   For instance, he said, there is talk among EEC members ofrequiring identical or equivalent technical and regulatoryconditions in non-member countries _ called reciprocity _ beforegranting them certain benefits of free access to EEC markets.   ``Whatever the shape of things to come, exporters who wish tosucceed in a post-1992 environment must pay close attention todevelopments as they unfold,'' Koenig said.   But the EEC's long-standing Common Agricultural Policy, whichincludes support of domestically produced commodities and theirprotection against foreign goods, has already determined what kindof conditions the United States will face after 1992.   ``Internal price supports probably will decline, but importprotection and export subsidization are likely to continue,'' Koenigsaid. ``This scenario could change if the (EEC) adopts a moremarket-oriented policy in consequence of the Uruguay Round of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.''   The 1992 model EEC will not have a single sovereign government,he said. Although the European Parliament will increase its powerslightly, it will lack the authority to interfere in a membercountry's affairs. The Council of Ministers will remain thelegislative branch of the EEC, and the Commission will continue asits executive branch.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 12</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
