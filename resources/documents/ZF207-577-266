became part of every informed Mac user'svocabulary.andP;  Since that time the Mac world has had to learn how to deal witha wide range of viruses, from the the original Peace virus to the ANTI virusfrom France.andM;As viruses have become more complex, so have virus-prevention programs.andO;Vaccine, a free utility from CE Software, was the first program thatattempted to catch viruses when they tried to infect applications.andP;  But newerviruses quickly overcame Vaccine's capabilities.andM;Now there are three sets of utilities that can prevent infection by amultitude of viruses.andP;  Symantec AntiVirus for Macintosh (SAM) from Symantec,Anti-Virus Kit from 1stAid Software and Virex 2.0 from HJC Software are theleaders in commercial virus prevention.andM;The first two are close cousins in their detection and prevention methods.andO;Virex 2.0 takes a somewhat different tack.andP;  Each offers a set of tools thatcan reduce the likelihood of a virus infection to almost nil.andM;What these programs do.andP;  The SAM package comes with SAM Intercept, whichoffers multiple levels of active protection, and SAM Virus Clinic, a programthat can repair infected files.andM;SAM Intercept is a Control Panel device (cdev) that can scan all the files onthe start-up disk or in your System folder for viruses when you start yourMacintosh or when you shut down.andP;  In the Finder or under MultiFinder, SAMalso alerts you when an inserted floppy is infected with a virus.andP;  Sam can beconfigured to cover different levels of protection.andP;  Basic protection willcheck for known viruses when you run applications; advanced protection willwatch for &quot;suspicious activities&quot; that might indicate the presence of avirus.andP;  Advanced protection covers almost any modification to the Macoperating system, whether caused by a virus or not.andP;  Even adding a deskaccessory or cdev is considered a suspicious activity.andP;  Fortunately, SAM canlearn which changes are harmless.andP;  Still, you will need patience the firstfew days working with SAM at the advanced level.andP;  It will alert you manytimes.andP;  If you tell SAM to learn a particular change, it won't bother youagain with that modification.andM;SAM Virus Clinic will repair files that are infected with most of the currentviruses.andP;  It can give you a printout of all infected files.andM;Anti-Virus Kit comes with three utilities that work together to preventinfection: the VirusGuard cdev; Inoculator, an application that stores animage of a disk's contents and can detect any variation from that image; andSame/Diff, a program that compares two copies of the same file to determineif one has been altered.andM;VirusGuard monitors changes to several resources.andP;  It can be configured sothat with Inoculator it will scan a hard disk at start-up for changes inapplications.andP;  Unfortunately, this means that just copying a file onto yourhard disk can cause a VirusGuard alert when you next start your Mac.andM;For this type of check to work, each disk you use must be &quot;inoculated&quot;beforehand by the Inoculator program.andP;  During this process, Inoculatoruncovers applications that have viruses as well as &quot;false positives,&quot; a virusalert for a non-existent virus.andP;  Some/Diff seems a little out of place here.andO;Its stated purpose is to track down the source of the virus, but this seemsless important than eradicating the viruses found.andP;  However, Anti-Virus Kitprovides no software to remove viruses.andM;All three manufacturers recommend deleting infected files and replacing themwith safe backups.andP;  However, being able to repair applications is a powerfulconvenience, especially when it is difficult to get at master disks.andM;Virex was the first commercial infection-repairing program.andP;  Version 2.0comes with two utilities: the self-named Virex and Virex-Guard, a new cdevthat checks floppies for viruses as they are inserted and checks applicationswhen you launch them.andM;Virex 2.0 has an Expert Mode that can make a record of your disks' contentsduring a scan for viruses.andP;  The record contains information like file sizeand the date of last modification.andP;  When either of these change, it couldmean you are infected with a virus.andM;How well do they work?andP;  SAM Intercept was able to detect the range of currentviruses.andP;  It never indicated that an uninfected file was infected.andP;  The SAMIntercept interface follows the Macintosh guidelines well and is easy tolearn.andP;  SAM Intercept was able to quickly find virus-infected files buriedeight folders deep in a 300-Mbyte hard disk with 5,000 files, and SAM VirusClinic repaired them all.andM;Anti-Virus needs improvement.andP;  It indicated that FullWrite 1.1 was infected(a classic false positive).andP;  VirusGuard was able to find the infected fileson the 300-Mbyte test disk, but it took nearly twice as long as SAM,Anti-Virus Kit is difficult to use, and its interface is complex.andP;  As aresult, explaining the program to large numbers of people (as in a networkedenvironment) would be troublesome.andM;Virex 2.0 was able to detect a range of viruses and to repair infected files.andO;It sometimes missed the ANTI virus on the first scan but always picked it upon the second try.andP;  The Record Scan in the Expert Mode worked well and wasable to detect all changes to files on our drive.andM;Problems.andP;  Virex, SAM and Anti-Virus Kit should be able to handle current andfuture viruses, but an infection would slip past any of them if an infecteddisk was used to start the Mac.andP;  SAM and Anti-Virus Kit, if configured toscan the hard disk at start-up, would catch the infected file immediately,but Virex would not catch it until the next time you ran an infectedapplication.andP;  Unknown new viruses are likely to be caught by SAM andVirusGuard, but Virex requires updates, which the company has been prompt indelivering for every new virus discovered.andP;  For example, the latest nFLUvirus requires Version 2.1 of Virex, although the current versions ofAnti-Virus Kit and SAM will detect it.andM;VirexGuard is not likely to be fooled by false positives, although when theyoccur there is no way to stop them from pestering you.andP;  With Anti-Virex Kit,false positives can be ignored, but doing so makes it easier for thoseapplications to do damage if they become infected later.andM;Documentation and support.andP;  All three utilities have more than adequatemanuals.andP;  The SAM manual has a small trouble-shooting section, and Anti-VirusKit covers &quot;virus theory&quot; well.andM;Technical support personnel from Symantec were quite slow in responding toour calls.andP;  It took four days.andP;  When they did return our call, they were ablesolve a complex network and virus problem.andM;1stAid's support personnel answered by the third ring each time we called,and they were both helpful and informed.andM;HJC's technical support personnel were able to answer our questions in atimely manner.andP;  But phone support, while helpful, was curt.andM;Conclusions.andP;  All three of the products reviewed here should detect currentviruses, but SAM stands above the others in features and implementation.andM;Anti-Virus Kit is inelegant and more susceptible to false positives than theother two.andP;  Unlike SAM, which can learn from its mistakes, Anti-Virus Kitwill always alert you every time a suspicious event occurs.andP;  While it candetect the same viruses as its competitors, Anti-Virus Kit requires threeprograms to do so and can't repair infected applications.andM;Virex 2.0's repair program is fast and is a full-blown solution to virusdetection.andP;  VirexGuard is easy to use but is not prepared to deal with newviruses.andP;  The ability to automatically scan floppy disks is useful, but itshould handle hard disk drives, too.andP;  We were unsettled that Virexoccasionally missed the ANTI virus.andM;SAM is the easiest of the three to use and has a more refined look than theothers.andP;  It comes with a program to repair infected files.andP;  SAM Intercept'sability to scan both inserted floppy disks and the start-up disk will be, innormal situations, all you need to keep viruses away.andP;  That and its abilityto learn from false positives make SAM the best anti-virus protectionavailable today.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
