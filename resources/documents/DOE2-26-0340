<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-26-0340 </DOCNO><TEXT>An expression is presented for computing the classical diffusion constantof a point defect (e.g., adatom) in an infinite lattice of binding sitesat arbitrary temperature. The transition state theory diffusion constantis simply multiplied by a dynamical correction factor that is computedfrom short-time classical trajectories initiated at the site boundaries.The time scale limitations of direct molecular dynamics are thus avoidedin the low and middle temperature regimes. The expression resulted fromtaking the time derivative of the particle mean square displacement inthe lattice-discretized coordinate system. Applications are presentedfor surface diffusion on fcc(100) and fcc(111) Lennard-Jones crystalfaces. 14 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
