Section 300.1 of the regulations incorporatesby reference the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual (PPQTreatment Manual). The PPQ Treatment Manual contains procedures and schedulesfor treating various regulated articles so that these articles may moveinto or within the United States and not present a plant pest risk. Papayas from Hawaii must be treated for three species of fruit flies, <T3>Ceratitis capitata, Dacus dorsalis, </T3>and <T3>D. curcubitae, </T3>before being moved into the continental UnitedStates. Recent research indicates that treating papayas from Hawaii witha dry heat treatment also destroys the fruit flies. This treatment canbe completed with less complicated equipment and in a shorter time thanthe existing treatments. Further, the dry heat treatment results in lessproduct damage. We propose to update the PPQ Treatment Manual to include this dry heattreatment to provide Hawaiian papaya shippers an additional treatment option.Specifically, we propose to amend andSection; 300.1 of the regulations toshow that the PPQ Treatment Manual, which is incorporated by referenceand on file at the Office of the Fededal Register, is being revised toinclude a dry heat treatment for papayas from Hawaii. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule would havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291.This propsoed rule would give an additional treatment option to the sevenpackinghouses in Hawaii that ship papayas to the United States mainland.The additional treatment option could be completed with less complicatedequipment in a shorter time period, and would result in a higher qualityproduct. No change in price or production is anticipated as a result ofthis rule. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The regulations in this rule contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
