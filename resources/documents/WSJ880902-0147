It is questionable whether Europe has a system at all. What it has is a crazy quilt of air-traffic control regimes, each with its own brands of equipment and software, and indigenous communications procedures and bureaucracy. With passenger traffic booming, the result is near-saturation of the European skies -- and huge delays on some flights.    &quot;The system in force can't accept the expansion of the traffic we're encountering,&quot; says Jean-Pierre Notte, a Boeing 747 first officer for a European carrier.    Imagine a flight from Copenhagen to Palma de Mallorca. Before takeoff, the pilot files a flight plan by telex to all the control &quot;territories&quot; through which the plane will pass. If there aren't any delays because of congestion, storms or technical problems, the pilot is ordered by Copenhagen Airport terminal controllers to take off. As the craft ascends, it passes to the keeping of the Copenhagen area radar control center.    It is then turned over successively to controllers in Maastricht, the Netherlands; Brussels; Rheims, France; Paris; Marseille; and Barcelona. Each time, the controller alerts his counterpart in the next airspace by telephone that the plane is coming. When the aircraft nears the Balearic Islands, a Barcelona controller hands it off to his colleague in Palma, who then gives it over to the Palma airport tower controller.    The more time controllers working on different systems have to spend telephoning and doing clerical tasks such as writing out slips of paper on each flight because their computer systems aren't capable of it, the less time they have to spend on separating the traffic and keeping travelers safe. And the longer and more frequent are the delays.    In the U.S. -- often held up as a model -- one big administration with standard procedures, training and equipment copes with the burgeoning traffic. With sophisticated computer links giving them warnings of traffic to come, controllers can spend more time watching out for problems in their airspace.    The recent U.S. government award of a $3.6 billion contract to International Business Machines Corp. to upgrade the U.S. system (now being contested by rival bidder Hughes Aircraft Co., a unit of General Motors Corp.) emphasizes how fragmented Europe is.    Flying in the U.S. &quot;is smoother,&quot; says Yves Enderle, a Boeing 737 captain for a Belgian airline. &quot;You may {encounter} only four different {control} centers while you're cruising {across the U.S.}, while you'll have seven or eight in Europe.&quot; This means there are more delays in Europe when traffic is heavy, he adds.    Even the future of Europe's air navigation system isn't being coordinated. Spain is pouring 15 billion pesetas ($122.2 million) into major new equipment by Ceselsa, a Spanish maker. Holland is spending $100 million on new memory systems for its N.V. Philips computers. West Germany plans to spend 700 million marks ($376 million) by 1992 to buy new radar transmission equipment and to replace its old telex and internal telephone systems with gear from AEG Telefunken AG. France plans to allocate 900 million francs ($142 million) for new radars, upgrading its Groupe Bull computer system, and new data displays. Britain's $1.1 billion upgrade includes a new London area center. All are buying different equipment and emphasizing different priorities.    Greece, on the verge of awarding huge contracts to computer companies, software makers, radar makers and others for its first modern air-control system, isn't making special efforts to buy a system that fits with any others in Europe.    Getting to an integrated system in Europe would necessitate cooperation at the highest political levels. To many, that seems a quixotic quest, doomed by high costs, nationalism and the desire to keep military airspace separate, and a myriad of practical difficulties, like choosing which nation's equipment to buy.    Consider the existing patchwork: In West Germany, for example, 1,240 fairly well-paid controllers handle 1.3 million flights a year using sophisticated Unisys Corp. and Siemens AG equipment. In Greece, on the other hand, there is no civilian radar, save for a small unit at Athens airport for approach and takeoff. The 490 Greek controllers earn an average of about $9,000 a year.    Few of the national systems' computers are linked with neighboring computers; most contact is by phone and telex. &quot;I am a railway enthusiast,&quot; says Hans C. Vorhauer, adviser to the director of the Dutch air-control administration. &quot;I compare the telephone connections between control centers to steam locomotives. In this age of advanced-technology 747s, we're still busy dialing until our fingers hurt on old-fashioned telephones.&quot;    Despite strong agreement that air-control systems should be centralized or at least better coordinated, no one expects Europeans to jointly purchase equipment, pool controller training and give over national sovereignty to a supranational air-traffic agency. They had that chance in 1963 when Eurocontrol was formed to take over air navigation from European Community member states. But Eurocontrol never was allowed to flourish; its only remaining center, in Maastricht, controls only the upper airspace of the Benelux states and northern West Germany.    There is hope. Europe's crowded skies have already led to limited cooperation. Eurocontrol's Maastricht center manages flow control for the Benelux states, while Frankfurt does it for Switzerland and Austria. Madrid coordinates Spain and Portugal. Copenhagen takes all of the Nordic states. This is a notable departure from patchwork sovereignty of the skies.    Moreover, an ambitious Eurocontrol project is under way to link the control centers in Maastricht, Brussels, Amsterdam, Bremen and Duesseldorf so they function as one. This will be done through the installation of high-speed data links to carry radar and flight information.    This $20 million-plus program is scheduled to be working by 1991. &quot;I very strongly hope that this will be a model states will want to follow,&quot; says Henrich Eckhardt, director of air navigation of the West German Transport Ministry.    But Mr. Eckhardt isn't optimistic about the prospect of unified skies. &quot;For the future, we'll have nationally staffed and operated centers,&quot; he concedes. &quot;So the question is how to interlink them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
