A filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeks to allow Natural Gas Pipeline instead to provide &quot;firm transportation&quot; of gas owned by others. Currently, the pipeline provides to 49 gas utility customers about 3.5 billion cubic feet of gas daily, an amount Natural Gas Pipeline is seeking to reduce to 2.8 billion cubic feet per day, according to a MidCon spokeswoman.    MidCon said that Natural Gas Pipeline hasn't been able to compete well with cheaper spot-market gas prices, and that sales to utility customers have fallen to below one-third of historical levels. Natural Gas Pipeline has faced growing liabilities because it must reserve gas from producers, to meet contract specifications, but often hasn't been able to sell it to the Natural Gas Pipeline customers that previously indicated a need for the gas.    MidCon said that if the government approves its request, pipeline gas utility customers will assume responsibility for getting as much as one-fifth of the daily gas supply that currently comes from Natural Gas Pipeline.    Los Angeles-based Occidental has interests in natural resources, chemicals and food processing. </TEXT></DOC>
