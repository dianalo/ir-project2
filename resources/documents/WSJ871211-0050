The biggest hurdle is persuading New York-based Pan Am's U.S. labor unions to accept $800 million in concessions over the four-year term of a new labor contract. Both union and Braniff officials gave the agreement about an even chance.    &quot;It's a tough sell,&quot; says a Pan Am source, who doubts that Dallas-based Braniff can &quot;get those commitments from the unions.&quot; Four unions met here yesterday to consider the plan. Union officials said they will meet today with Braniff's chairman, Jay Pritzker, whose family owns 94% of the voting stock of Braniff.    The merger agreement follows an acrimonious battle between Pan Am's chairman, C. Edward Acker, who pushed for the merger, and Martin Shugrue Jr., vice chairman, who fought Mr. Acker in an attempt to keep the airline. Following a tense board meeting Wednesday night, which lasted about 90 minutes, all but one of Pan Am's 12 directors backed Mr. Acker, a Pan Am source said.    Mr. Shugrue apparently didn't take his defeat lightly, said the source, who opposed his view. &quot;He came in later and announced to people working on the news release: 'I'm in touch with the unions, and the unions aren't going to deal with Pritzker,'&quot; the source said.    Mr. Shugrue didn't return calls seeking comment.    J. Patrick Foley, Braniff's chief executive officer, said the company is &quot;optimistic&quot; about reaching an agreement with Pan Am employees. &quot;It's a big step getting by the board,&quot; he said.    Both sides are working under a tight deadline. Pan Am's board gave Mr. Pritzker until Dec. 22 to win concessions. And even if the unions' leadership agrees, the rank and file of the five unions representing Pan Am's workers must approve the plan by Jan. 19.    One factor working in Mr. Pritzker's favor is that most of the unions are loath to deal with Pan Am's current management, which has presided over losses of $400 million last year and $19.8 million through the first nine months of 1987. &quot;We're not going to give the present management concessions because it's like giving money to a drunk,&quot; says George Miranda, vice president of Local 732 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in New York.    &quot;It remains to be seen&quot; whether the unions will support the agreement, said Michael Connery, a lawyer representing a coalition of four unions in the talks. &quot;I give it at least a 50-50 chance.&quot;    The combined Pan Am-Braniff entity would control 7% to 8% of the industry's traffic and would be roughly the same size as the USAir Group Inc.-Piedmont Aviation Inc. combination, which is the industry's seventh-largest airline concern.    Under the agreement, Pan Am shareholders would get a 55% stake in the new company while retaining their shares in the parent Pan Am Corp., which would continue as a publicly traded company. Braniff holders would get about a 25% stake, and Pan Am's unions would get about a 20% stake in return for the concessions.    The combination would have to be approved by Pan Am holders and the Transportation Department.    Pan Am Corp., which had revenue of $2.24 billion last year, would retain several operations that industry analysts expect to have 1987 revenue of about $700 million. They are Pan Am Shuttle Inc., the East Coast shuttle service; World Services, a contract-services unit; and Pan Am Express, a regional commuter airline. Analysts expect Pan American World Airways to have revenue of $2.9 billion this year.    The merger might take as long as six months to complete, Mr. Foley said. Mr. Pritzker might then continue to operate the two airlines as independent entities for as long as several years afterward, sources close to Braniff said. In addition to the wage concessions, Mr. Pritzker thinks he could save as much as a further $100 million annually from cost efficiencies from combining the two airlines, a source close to Braniff said. &quot;Mr. Pritzker really believes with the right type of labor agreement, we can have a very viable, profitable operation,&quot; Mr. Foley said.    Analysts, however, questioned whether Braniff's small domestic route system would be enough to bolster Pan Am's weak domestic operations, which feed its international routes. Braniff carried less than 1% of the industry's traffic through the first 10 months of this year.    The agreement received a lukewarm response from Wall Street yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Pan Am closed at $3.375, down 25 cents. In over-the-counter trading, Braniff shares were quoted at a bid price of $4.25, down 12.5 cents.    Separately, Braniff reported third-quarter profit of $1.6 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $61,000. The results mark Braniff's second consecutive quarterly profit after several big losses. Revenue rose 35% to $82.1 million from $60.7 million a year earlier. For the nine months, Braniff's net loss widened to $7.8 million, including a $3 million pretax gain from the sale of landing rights, from $4.5 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 24% to $218.2 million from $176.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
