Schwammberger, 77, was one of the world's most-wanted suspectedwar criminals before his arrest in Argentina in November 1987 on aWest German warrant.   Prosecutors say he was responsible for the torture and murder ofthousands of people, mostly Jews, while commander of Nazi laborcamps during World War II.   High-ranking officials from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in LosAngeles said they were worried that Schwammberger remains inArgentina.   ``The hard truth is, they have had ample time to deal with thematter, and now we're getting worried,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier,dean at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, on Monday.   ``It's happened before that people have died in jail withoutbeing brought to justice,'' Hier said in an interview at the Colognehotel where he was staying.   Hier said he was informed by West German Justice Minister HansEngelhard on Monday that Argentina has told West Germany theextradition hearings could take another year.   ``This is an ominous development,'' Hier said. ``We think it'snecessary for the new Argentine government to immediately declareitself on the Schwammberger case.''   President Carlos Menem of Argentina succeeded Raul Alfonsin thismonth.   Hier also met in Bonn with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.Hier said he asked the chancellor to contact Menem aboutSchwammberger.   ``The chancellor responded that he would look into this matterand indicated there would be contact,'' Hier said.   Simon Wiesenthal, the famous Austrian Nazi hunter, and colleaguesworking for him had sought Schwammberger for years.   In October 1987, the Simon Wiesenthal Center listed Schwammbergeras among the most-wanted Nazi war criminals still at large andannounced he was believed hiding in Argentina.   The center's list appeared in Argentine newspapers, and Argentineauthorities were tipped off about his whereabouts.   According to Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean at the LosAngeles center, the Wiesenthal organization has found about 50witnesses in the United States, Canada, Israel and Britain who cantestify that Schwammberger was responsible for the murder of laborcamp inmates.   Cooper said they included about a dozen former labor camp inmateswho saw Schwammberger personally carrying out inmate executions.   ``To us the most important thing is putting Schwammberger ontrial for history,'' Hier said. ``To allow a person like this to sitin jail in Argentina without a trial doesn't serve the record ofhistory.''</TEXT></DOC>
