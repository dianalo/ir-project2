Connolly Jr., chairman and chiefexecutive officer of the Bank of New England Corp., will resign hisCEO position when a replacement is found, the troubled bank said ina statement Tuesday.   Asked if this meant Connolly will stay on as chairman, MarciaRyan, a bank spokeswoman, said only ``the word of the release is asit stands.'' She acknowledged ``there is an ambiguity'' about thewording regarding Connolly's future position with the bank.   Bank of New England also announced Tuesday it had designated theexecutive committee of its board of directors and three specialboard committees to examine key structural aspects of its businessand operations.   Since the bank's troubles began, federal banking regulators haveincreased scrutiny of its operations. Financial analysts hadspeculated that a major reshuffling of the bank's top managementwas forthcoming.   ``It's certainly been rumored around Hartford and Boston that he(Connolly) might step aside,'' said Tracey Stangle, an analyst withFirst Albany Corp., who works out of Hartford, Conn. ``I guess forthat reason it didn't come as a surprise.''   The announcement came after the stock market closed Tuesday.Bank of New England was the most active issue on the New York StockExchange, with more than 2.2 million shares changing hands. Theshares fell 12.5 cents to close at $7.37{.   Stangle said Connolly has been a driving force at the bank.``He's a very strong-willed guy that has run the institution forthe past 10 years or so,'' he said, adding it was unclear who wouldtake his place as chief executive.   The bank's board appointed a committee to begin a search forcandidates to succeed Connolly, who said he would resign his postas chief executive when a replacement is found, the company said ina statement.   The statement said Connolly will continue working with anotherboard committee on further expense reductions, financial mattersand other improvements in operations.   In another sign of its financial difficulties, the bank onFriday rescinded its common stock dividend of 34 cents a share forthe fourth quarter. Earlier this month, the bank said it wouldboost its loan reserves above $1 billion and that it expected a``substantial'' loss for the year.   The new special committees are ``designed to assure that theproblems faced by the organization as a result of the unprecedenteddevelopments in the real estate market are addressed in a timelyand comprehensive manner,'' the statement said.   The special committees, made up of non-management board members,would work closely with the corporation's management and the bankregulatory agencies, the company said.   Gordon I. Ulmer, the company's president, was named to begin aneffort to address all aspects of the real estate loan portfolio ofBank of New England's banking subsidiaries in Massachusetts. He wascharged to report to the executive committee of the company'sboard, assisted by the board's special advisor, Washington-basedSecura Group.   Industry analysts said the move reflected the serious troubleBank of New England faces due to a real estate slump that affecteda number of other banks in the region.   Bank of New England also said Tuesday it is continuing to workwith the investment firm Lazard Freres andamp; Co. to explore possibleasset sales or mergers. A special board committee has been named tooversee this effort, the company said.   Separately Tuesday, an investor group that includes CBS Inc.Chief Executive Laurence M. Tisch said it holds a 6.6 percent stakein Bank of Boston Corp., New England's largest bank.   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, thegroup said it acquired the 4.7 million shares for investmentpurposes only. It paid $94.5 million for them.</TEXT></DOC>
