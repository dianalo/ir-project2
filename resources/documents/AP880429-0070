Roh plans to replace several senior Cabinet and party officialsto apportion blame for the election defeat and to give theadministration a more moderate image, the aides said.   Presidential aides, who spoke on condition they not beidentified further, said the changes in the government and theDemocratic Justice Party are expected to come as early as next week.   One aide said the reorganization would be ``extensive,''affecting presidential advisers and Cabinet posts, including theministries of Justice and Home Affairs. Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jaewould not be affected, he said.   Government and governing party officials said the strongopposition showing in Tuesday's National Assembly elections hasforced them to change strategy, to seek dialogue and compromise.   ``Reform through dialogue would be a new form of politics,'' theaide said.   Victims of the reorganization may include Ahn Moo-hyuk, directorof the Agency for National Security Planning, who was retained fromthe government of former President Chun Doo-hwan, another aide said.   The intelligence agency came under fire for alleged attempts tosmear some important opposition candidates in Tuesday's elections.   An extensive reorganization of the governing party isinevitable. Chairman Chae Moon-shik and other top officials offeredto resign to take responsibility for the humiliating electionsetback, the Roh aides said.   In Tuesday's balloting, opposition candidates left the governingparty without a parliamentary majority for the first time in SouthKorea's 40-year history.   Three opposition parties secured 164 seats in the 299-memberNational Assembly. The Democratic Justice Party won 125 seats andindependents took 10.   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung, whose Party for Peace andDemocracy emerged as the main opposition party with 71 seats inTuesday's election, said today that he ``would not opposeeverything the government proposes.''   ``We will cooperate as long as the Roh regime carries out itspromised democratic reforms,'' Kim told reporters.   Projecting a moderate image, the 62-year-old opposition leadersaid he would also cooperate to insure a successful staging of the1988 Olympic Games, opening in Seoul in September.   Kim said he would ask the Seoul government to be ``magnanimous''and allow North Korea to take part in the Olympics.   He said he has some ideas on ways of persuading North Korea toparticipate in the Games, but refused to disclose details beforeconsultation with the government in May.   Kim also welcomed a proposal for a united anti-Roh coalition inthe Assembly. He said he would closely cooperate with rivalopposition leaders Kim Young-sam of the Reunification DemocraticParty and Kim Jong-pil of the New Democratic Republican Party.   The three Kims, who won parliamentary seats in Tuesday'selections, said they would meet next week to work out a newanti-government strategy.   Party officials said the three Kims then will propose a meetingwith Roh that government officials say Roh will welcome.   With Kim Dae-jung and Kim Youmg-sam splitting the oppositionvote, Roh won just 36.6 percent of the vote in December's election,the country's first direct presidential balloting in 16 years.</TEXT></DOC>
