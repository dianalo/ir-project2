The mainprogram of experiments was directed at elucidating the accumulation oflung burden during chronic (i.e., repeated) exposure. For this, ratswere exposed to a toxic dust and a relatively non-toxic dust (titaniumdioxide). The results showed that lung burdens scaled with respect toexposure concentration, lung burdens increased progressively with exposuretime, lung burdens decreased with time post-exposure, and transfer tolymph nodes appeared to commence when the lung burden reached a thresholdlevel which was higher for the non-toxic dust than for the toxic dust.The accumulation of lung burden was modelled mathematically by incorporatinga sequestration compartment into a conventional model with two clearancecompartments.</TEXT></DOC>
