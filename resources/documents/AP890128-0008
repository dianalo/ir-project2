(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 8,100-acre Stanford University campushas apparently became a popular place for cat owners to abandontheir pets, officials say.   An estimated 1,500 cats live in storm drains, steam tunnels andjust about everywhere at the school, says Herb Fong, the manager ofgrounds and custodial services.   Fong said the university will place traps that won't hurt theanimals, beginning Feb. 22. Cats with identification tags will bereleased, but those that appear to be untamed will be taken to theSanta Clara County animal shelter.   Fong said animal lovers often feed the cats.   ``They're not tame enough to just take home,'' he said. ``Thereare some areas that employees don't want to go into because of theferal cats that are in there. You get a wild cat trapped in acorner, they'll be biting and scratching their way out of there.''</TEXT></DOC>
