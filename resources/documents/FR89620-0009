A notice of correction was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 6, 1988 (53 FR 39403). During thecomment period, nine comments were received, six from Federal agencies,one from an association of county governments, one from an individual andone from a public utility.<ITAG tagnum="52">Part 2800_DEFINITIONS</ITAG>Two comments suggested that the definition of trespass, as provided inthe proposed rulemaking at 43 CFR 2800.0-5(u), be expanded to address usesallowed by prior statute. These suggestions are consistent with the Bureau'sintent to safeguard uses allowed by prior statute, and the final rulemakingadopts the suggestions by expanding andSection; 2800.0-5(u) to include usesallowed by prior statute.One comment suggested that unnecessary and undue degradation be considereda trespass even when associated with a Revised Statute (RS) 2477 right-of-wayor grant of easement to mining and settlement claims. The proposed definitionprovided in 43 CFR 2800.0-5(u) classifies all unnecessary and undue degradationas a trespass without excluding trespasses associated with an RS 2477 right-of-wayor grant of easement to mining and settlement claims. The final rule is,therefore, unchanged.One comment suggested that the proposed definition for ``willful trespass''as defined in the proposed rulemaking and ``knowing and willful'' as definedin 43 CFR 2920 be consistent. Since it is our intent that these terms andtheir definitions be synonymous, the definition in 43 CFR 2920 will berevised when those regulations are amended.One comment suggested that trespass should not be considered ``willful''where it is ``virtually impossible for a person to identify or locate thepublic lands.'' The Bureau believes such a situation would qualify as atrespass committed by ``mistake or inadvertence,'' which is criteria fornonwillful trespass as proposed and therefore, the final rule is unchanged.One comment recommend that a definition of ``current use fee, amortizationfee, and maintenance fee'' be included in final rulemaking. The Bureaurecognizes the value in this suggestion and therefore, a definition hasbeen added in the final rule as andSection; 2800.0-5(z).Unauthorized Use, Occupancy or DevelopmentOne comment requested clarification as to whether penalties for unauthorizeduse, occupancy or development outlined in andSection; 2801.3(c) are to beapplied in addition to the actions identified in andSection; 2801.3(b). Thepenalties are to be applied in addition to the actions identified in andSection;2801.3(b). 43 CFR 2801.3(b) lists the liabilities of anyone determinedby the authorized officer to have trespassed as provided in andSection; 2801.3(a).43 CFR 2801.3(c) lists the penalties an authorized officer shall applydepending on whether the trespass is determined to be either willful, repeatednonwillful, or not resolved within 30 days after receipt of a written demand.One comment suggested that 43 CFR 2801.3 (unauthorized use, occupancy ordevelopment) as proposed failed to recognize types of right-of-way trespassother than road use. Reference to other kinds of trespass, i.e., for usesrequiring authorization pursuant to the regulations in 43 CFR 2800 and2880, include all types of uses requiring rights-of-way or permits underTitle V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Mineral LeasingAct, as amended. Therefore, the final rule is not changed as suggested.One comment requested that the starting point of the 30-day period in andSection;2801.3(c)(1) be identified. The proposed rulemaking identifies the beginningof the 30 day period to be the date of receipt of a written demand. TheBureau recognizes the inherent ambiguity in the term ``receipt of a writtendemand''. Therefore, a definition of ``written demand'' is added as paragraph(y) under andSection; 2800.0-5 and means a written demand in the form ofa billing notice for payment of trespass liability which in no case willbe less than the minimum amount as identified in andSection; 2801.3(d) andwill be delivered by certified mail, return receipt requested, or personallyserved.Three comments suggested that the time period for which trespass damagesare computed in the proposed rulemaking is inconsistent with 43 CFR 2920.1-2(b).Since the Bureau of Land Management is required by the FLPMA to receivefair market value for the use of the public lands and their resources forthe period of use, the 6 year period is not included in the rulemaking.Two comments recommended increasing the grace period (allowed for nonwillfultrespass before assessing penalties) to 45 or 60 days after receipt ofa written demand in order to provide adequate time for reaching an amicablesettlement. One comment recommended deleting the requirement that penaltiesfor a nonwillful trespass be assessed if the trespass is not resolved withinthe 30 day period. A definition of ``written demand'' has been added asandSection; 2800.0-5(y) which will clarify at what time the 30 day periodbegins. The written demand is the culmination of fact finding meetingsand investigation by field officials. The written demand is issued afterthe trespasser and the authorized officer have finished resolution meetingsand the authorized officer has determined the amount of liability due theUnited States based upon information provided by the trespasser and factsprovided from the trespass investigation. The trespasser has 30 days topay the damages due as identified in the written demand; a penalty is appliedif payment is not received within those 30 days. This penalty is providedto insure a timely final resolution to the trespass. Penalty is avoidedwhen one of the three conditions in andSection; 9239.7-1 of this title havebeen satisfied. Provisions are also allowed in item (c) of 43 CFR 9239.7-1for the authorized officer to ``determine in writing'' that a legitimatedispute exists. The authorized officer therefore has the authority at anytime prior to issuance of the written demand for payment to adjust liabilitiesand any time during the 30 day period to acknowledge a legitimate disputeto prevent the penalty assessment. Doubling the rental value as penaltyfor an excessive delay in resolution is also provided in 43 CFR 2920. Therefore,these comments were not adopted in the final rulemaking.One comment stated that the proposed rulemaking did not provide for a timeframeto resolve repeated nonwillful or willful trespass. The ``30 day'' timeframein the proposed rulemaking at andSection; 2801.3(c)(1) is the measure oftime after which penalties for nonwillful trespass are to be addressedfor failure to satisfy liabilities by meeting one of the conditions inandSection; 9239.7-1, not the time allowed to resolve a trespass. No specifictime period is identified for total trespass investigation and resolution.A clarification is included in andSection; 2801.3(c)(1) and 2800.0-5(y) ofthe final rulemaking.One comment suggested allowing the discretionary increase of penaltiesby 3 to 5 times the rental or road use, amortization and maintenance chargeswhen trespass is repeated. The proposed rulemaking provides for penaltieson repeated trespass which we believe are adequate. The suggestion to providediscretionary authority to increase the penalty for repeated trespass to5 times the rental value is considered harsh, is inconsistent with existing43 CFR 2920 regulations, and, therefore, is not adopted.One comment suggested that the phrase ``inception of trespass'' in subparagraphs2801.3(c)(1) and (2) could be interpreted to mean either the date the trespassbegan or the date a trespass was discovered and a case established. TheBureau believes that the term ``inception of trespass'' generally is understoodto mean the date on which a trespass began (as can be proven by methodsnormally used in establishing a period in time, such as by photos, witnesses,evidence, admission, etc.). Therefore, the final rule is unchanged.One comment suggested that the reimbursement of costs incurred by the UnitedStates in investigation and termination of a trespass be recovered by utilizingthe fee schedule found in 43 CFR 2808.3 and 3808.4 to determine liabilityfor administrative costs. As no trespass cases have been completed by whichan average of administrative costs can be determined, the suggested averagefee schedule cannot be used at this time. Actual costs determined by accuraterecord keeping will be needed until a determination can be made as to whetheran average fee schedule is proper. Therefore, this suggestion is not adoptedin the final rulemaking.One comment suggested that the requirement of a minimum settlement feeas required in andSection; 2801.3(e) of the proposed rulemaking would hinderresolving trespass and may cost more to collect than an amount which otherwisecould be collected. The State Director presently has the authority, withconcurrence of the Field Solicitor, to compromise or write off trespassliability up to $20,000 and to suspend collection action (write off) uncollectabletrespass liability claims of up to $600. The FLPMA requires receipt offair market value for use of public lands and resources unless otherwiseprovided for by statute such as in the Federal Claims Collection Standards.Collection of administrative costs has been upheld, see <T3>Henry Deaton</T3> (101 IBLA 177), and also is provided for in 43 CFR2920 and 43 CFR 4150. Based upon studies conducted for right-of-way applications,processing a case costs, at a minimum, the amount identified for a CategoryI (all information contained in the office and no field trips involved)right-of-way application. In light of minimum right-of-way case processingcosts and the State Director's authority to compromise or write off debtsup to $20,000 for good cause, the concerns of this suggestion are met byexisting mechanisms. The suggestion to eliminate the minimum fee requirementin the final rulemaking is not adopted.One comment suggested that the term ``other lands use request'' as usedin andSection; 2801.3(e) be clarified. The authorities for the final rulemakingmay be found at 43 U.S.C. 1181a, 1181b, 1733, 1740, 1761-1771 and 30 U.S.C.185. These authorities include rights-of-way and permits under Title Vof FLPMA, the Mineral Leasing Act, and Tram Roads on the Revested Oregonand California Railroad and Reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant Lands(Oandamp;C). Lands actions which may be authorized by other authorities arenot included in this final rulemaking, and no further explanation is required.One comment suggested changing the wording in 43 CFR 2801.3(g) and 43 CFR9262.1 to ``knowing and willful trespassers shall be tried'' before a UnitedStates Magistrate rather than ``may be tried.'' The wording ``may be tried''is consistent with wording in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act(43 U.S.C. 1733). Therefore, this suggestion is not adopted in the finalrulemaking.One comment suggested that public utilities providing service to partiesaccused of trespass be allowed to remain in service until the party receivingthe services is legally judged to be in trespass. In the instance described,both the public utility and the party being served would be in trespass,i.e., the utility company is in trespass for service lines and the partyserved by the utility company is in trespass for the utilities to whichthe utility lines run. The utility and the party being served are legallyjudged to be in trespass only after the appeal period for a notice of trespasshas expired without appeal, decision on appeal has been made, or the trespasserjudged to be in trespass in court proceedings. The utility may file a usepermit or right-of-way application requesting authorization to continueservice pending the outcome of all appeals to satisfy any concern. Therefore,the suggested change is not adopted as no removal is required until a use,occupancy or development is considered a trespass in accordance with existinglaw.One comment suggested that an authorized officer be able to resolve anunauthorized use, occupancy, or development through an amicable settlement,by giving the trespasser a grant for his unauthorized use and not requirea formal trespass procedure. As stated previously, provisions are availablewhich allow the State Director to compromise or write off debts of up to$20,000. This allows the flexibility suggested where cause exists. Also,without formal notice, a trespasser is not legally notified of his liability.Therefore, this suggestion is not adopted in the final rulemaking.One comment suggested that a trespasser not be allowed to file a bond,conditioned upon payment of the damages due, as provided in andSection; 9239.7-1item (b) in order to be eligible for a new permit, license, authorizationor grant. The rulemaking should allow new authorizations to any trespasserwho has filed a bond to compensate the United States for outstanding trespassliabilities. The allowance provides for issuance of new authorizationspending payment of outstanding liabilities yet assures that the UnitedStates will recover just compensation. This provision will allow timelycompletion of multiple applications in progress. Additional penalties forwillful trespass are provided in andSection; 9262.1. Therefore, this suggestionis not included in the final rulemaking.One comment suggested clarification of andSection; 9239.7-1 (rights-of-waytrespass on public lands) for the types of uses which shall not be allowedto a party with an unresolved trespass. Existing rules provide that nonew right-of-way or permit under 43 CFR Parts 2800, 2810 or 2880 may beissued to a trespasser until one of the conditions identified in Section9239.7-1 is met. Therefore, the final rulemaking is unchanged.One comment suggested that the rule should be revised to delete from andSection;9239.7-1 the words ``and received by the applicant.'' In most cases, itis difficult to determine when a letter has been received by the addressee.It is not unusual for weeks to pass before proof of delivery has been receivedby the Bureau. Therefore, the final rule is changed to state that the granttakes effect on the date of the authorized officer's signature.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part 9260_Law Enforcement_Criminal</ITAG>One comment asked whether a trial before a United States Magistrate asspecified in 43 CFR Part 9262-1 and provision for fine and/or imprisonmentare pursued in addition to rent and other charges imposed under andSection;2801.3. Criminal penalties are applied in addition to civil penalties,where the trespasser is convicted in a criminal prosecution. Such prosecutionmay be brought independently of civil damage recovery proceedings.The principal author of this final rulemaking is Oscar Anderson, Divisionof Lands and Realty, Bureau of Land Management, assisted by the Divisionof Legislation and Regulatory Management, Bureau of Land Management.It is hereby determined that this final rulemaking does not constitutea major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C)of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)is required.The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 and will not have a significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).The changes made by this final rulemaking will not have an effect uponthe legitimate users of the public lands and resources. The changes madeby the final rulemaking will provide procedures for processing cases involvinginstances of illegal use of the public lands for rights-of-way and roaduse purposes, for recovering fair market value of the use of public landsand resources for right-of-way and road use purposes, for providing penaltiesfor repeated and willful illegal use, for recovering adminstrative costsfor processing these cases, and for rehabilitation costs of public landsand resources damaged through illegal use. The impact of the final rulemakingwill be the same, regardless of the size of the entity involved in an illegaluse.The rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 etseq.For the reasons set out above, 43 CFR Parts 2800, 2810, 2880, 9230, 9260are amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="6">James M.
