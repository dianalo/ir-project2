Journal on Pat Robertson:   Republican presidential hopeful Pat Robertson has a problem withmaking outrageous statements that he can't back up with facts.   He labeled Planned Parenthood supporters as people trying tocreate a master race just because birth control pioneer MargaretSanger dabbled in eugenics back around the turn of the century.   He warned us that there are nuclear missiles in Cuba and offeredas proof that ``no one can prove there aren't missiles there.''   Now he has the gall to suggest, though he admits he has noproof, that the George Bush campaign is behind TV preacher JimmySwaggart's fall from grace in an attempt to discredit Robertson, aformer TV evangelist trying hard to distance himself from that past.   Robertson doesn't need anyone to discredit him. He appears to bedoing a fine job of it himself.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 24   The Knoxville (Tenn.) News-Sentinel on playing politics withappointments:   Ohio's Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum has gotten himself alltwisted out of shape over the Justice Department's refusal torelease certain of its files to the Senate Judiciary Committee.   The files relate to the department's investigation of reportsthat former U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland Faith Ryan Whittleseymishandled some entertainment funds.   She was said to have entertained American friends with privatelydonated money that was intended to be used to fete foreignofficials. The Justice Department said there was no evidence toproduce a ``viable criminal case.''   That wasn't good enough for Metzenbaum. He wants to come up withsomething politically damaging to the Reagan administration.   Metzenbaum is holding up Senate confirmation of four Reaganappointees to federal court judgeships.   This isn't just playing politics. It's hostage-taking, and itill becomes a senator of the United States.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 29   Sioux Falls (S.D.) Argus Leader on President Reagan's budget:   However else he is remembered, Ronald Reagan will go down as thebiggest spender in the history of the presidency.   The $1.1 trillion national budget he proposed recently wouldonly increase military spending about 2 percent.   In addition, Reagan has an agreement with Congress to run uponly $136 billion more debt during the next budget year. In fiscal1987, they accumulated $148 billion in debt.   Minor concessions like that will not erase the fact that Reagan,more than any other president, has led the nation into what seemslike a bottomless pit of overdue bills.   Of course, Reagan is not entirely to blame. Every Democratic andRepublican representative and senator who has served in Congresssince Reagan took office in 1981 must shoulder part of the blamefor the nation's spending problems.   Reagan, the candidate who promised to balance the budget, hasfailed financially. He has less than a year remaining in his term _not enough time to balance the budget.   The good news is that this is an election year. Taxpayers andvoters have the opportunity _ and an obligation _ to holdpresidential candidates accountable on that issue.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 28   The Orange County (Calif.) Register on the Supreme Court parodydecision:   When the U.S. Supreme Court hands down a unanimous decision, youmight figure it was a cut-and-dried case. Not so with last week'sdecision upholding Hustler magazine's disgusting parody of the Rev.Jerry Falwell.   While the court seemed to grant almost absolute protection tospeech that is intended as satire, it left blurred the line thatdistinguishes fact from fiction, parody from portrayal.   At issue was a 1983 takeoff of a well-known liquor advertisementin which famous people describe the ``first time'' they tasted theproduct. In Hustler's version, Falwell was depicted as having sexwith his mother in an outhouse.   Outraged, the televangelist and founder of the Moral Majoritysued publisher Larry Flynt for $45 million for libel, invasion ofprivacy and infliction of emotional distress.   A lower court had no trouble discerning that the parody wasfiction. Thus Falwell did not have a case for libel. ... But itawarded him $200,000 for emotional distress.   It took the Supreme Court to rule that awards for emotionaldistress require ... (proof of) factual falsehood, the standard forlibel. ... And now the court rules draw a distinction betweensatire, which is absolutely free, and seriousness, which is not.   Free speech should mean just that. ... In the marketplace ofideas and public opinion, truth almost always will win out.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 27   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on foreign-held patents:   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued 89,385 patents lastyear. A stunning 46.6 percent of them went to people who are notU.S. citizens.   Americans are inventing more things than they used to, sayofficials at the patent office. But non-Americans are inventing ata faster pace.   In the past two decades, the share of U.S. patents awarded toforeigners has more than doubled. From the patent office's figures,the chief competitors of the future will be the Japanese, whoclaimed 17,288 patents, and the West Germans, who registered 8,030.   It seems likely that more of the next generation of Americanswill be paying license fees, and more inventors in other nationswill be sitting back collecting royalties.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
