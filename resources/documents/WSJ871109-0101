Adams andamp; Reinhart Inc., a corporate and financial public relations concern, found that in the two weeks following the market plunge, 87% of investors surveyed didn't sell any stock or stock-oriented mutual funds and 54% said they will consider buying stock in the next six months.    &quot;Contrary to popular impression, the individual investor is not in a state of panic,&quot; said George Sard, president of the firm. &quot;Instead of dumping their stocks, most investors have held on to their shares, apparently out of a basic confidence in the market and portfolio companies.&quot;    When asked why they haven't sold, 34% of the 340 investors surveyed said they took a long-term approach to investing, 23% cited confidence in the companies whose shares they own and and 9% said they were satisfied with their portfolio companies' performance since the bull market began in 1982. Only 6% said they held their shares because the market was too volatile and 2% wanted to sell but couldn't reach their brokers.    Of the investors who said they would consider buying stock over the next six months, 22% said low price would be the most important factor, followed by earnings growth (17%) and company size and reputation (16%). High dividend yield was cited by 11%, and 5% mentioned a company stock buy-back program. </TEXT></DOC>
