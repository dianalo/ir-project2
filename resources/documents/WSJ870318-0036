Attorneys for the House and Senate investigative committees met privately yesterday with a representative of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. Details of the agreement are expected to be announced after the two panels meet separately this morning.    A formal vote on immunity for Adm. Poindexter isn't expected today, but the proposed compromise underscores his importance in the inquiry. He is believed to have intimate knowledge of U.S. arms sales to Iran and of Reagan administration efforts to funnel aid to Nicaraguan insurgents. As national security adviser, Adm. Poindexter had direct access to President Reagan. The Senate committee, in particular, has put a high priority on securing Adm. Poindexter's testimony.    Adm. Poindexter, invoking the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, so far has refused to testify on the affair. Yesterday, he again refused to testify when called by a House Government Operations subcommittee, which is investigating administration efforts to restrict public access to sensitive information in federal computer systems.    Mr. Walsh has been urging the committees to wait 90 days before giving Adm. Poindexter immunity. He is concerned that too early a grant of immunity could jeopardize his criminal investigation. Under the committees' plan to grant &quot;use&quot; immunity, Mr. Walsh couldn't use any information contained in Adm. Poindexter's testimony as evidence against the former national security adviser unless he could show he got the information elsewhere.    Under the tentative compromise, a vote on immunity would come in late April. To meet Mr. Walsh's concerns, any resulting public testimony by Adm. Poindexter would be delayed until at least June 10. But congressional investigators would be able to move ahead with their inquiries by conducting private interviews with the admiral in May. The success of the compromise depends on all sides keeping this preliminary testimony from public disclosure.    The congressional committees also appear certain to grant limited immunity to Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, the former National Security Council aide who was fired for his role in the Iran-Contra affair. But under the tentative agreement, lawmakers wouldn't decide the matter until June. That timetable also assures Mr. Walsh of the 90-day delay he sought for his inquiry.    For Congress, the greater priority has been to get Adm. Poindexter to testify.    Neither panel appears inclined to extend immunity to compel the testimony of retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, who was active in facilitating U.S. weapon shipments to Iran and in the sale of arms to the Nicaraguan Contras. But the committees are expected today to consider granting immunity to several less important figures in the private arms network that the general supervised with Col. North.    Among these are Robert Owen, who is believed to have been an important liaison for Col. North with the Contra supply operation, and Richard Gadd, a retired Air Force officer who was an important associate of Gen. Secord. A third person expected to receive immunity is Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl, a former aide to Col. North at the NSC.    Separately, investigators are pursuing possible connections between Col. North's operations and a British company, KMS Ltd., made up of former members of Britain's elite Special Air Services (SAS). KMS has been hired by the government of Sri Lanka to train forces in anti-guerrilla warfare. According to special-operations veterans, the company has a long history as a clandestine operator in the Mideast and Africa.    A chart found among Col. North's papers identifies a series of corporations that played a role in funneling money and arms to Nicaraguan insurgents. Among these is one labeled &quot;KMS.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
