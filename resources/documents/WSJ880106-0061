James (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ABT </CO><IN> PHA </IN><TEXT>   Researchers have taken a major step toward preventing and curing a respiratory disease that's the most common cause of illness and death for premature babies.    A team of scientists at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and Abbott Laboratories, a health-care company, have discovered two important proteins needed for proper lung function, and cloned the genes responsible for the proteins.    The discovery and successful gene splicing holds out the promise of an effective treatment for premature babies suffering from respiratory distress syndrome, or hyaline membrane disease. About 40,000 newborns are afflicted each year with the disease; about 10,000 die from it.    Besides babies, an estimated 300,000 adults a year suffer respiratory distress syndrome, with about half that number dying from the ailment.    The recently discovered proteins spur the creation of lung surfactant, a substance that coats the lining of healthy lungs, allowing oxygen in the lungs to diffuse into the bloodstream. Surfactant also keeps the lungs from collapsing after exhalation.    Very premature babies, especially those born 22 weeks or less into gestation, don't produce surfactant. Present therapy involves placing such infants in an environment of highly pressurized oxygen, but that often results in permanent neurological and tissue damage.    The work done by the Cincinnati and Abbott researchers, some of which was published in yesterday's issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry, hastens the day when human surfactant could be produced in great quantities through recombinant DNA technology.    Currently, researchers in the U.S., Europe and Japan have tested surfactant extracted from cow lungs in babies, with good results. &quot;Some pediatricians say you can actually see a blue baby turn red right before your eyes. That's how dramatic it is,&quot; said J. Lawrence Fox, director of molecular biology for North Chicago, Ill.-based Abbott Laboratories.    Jeffrey Whitsett, director of Children's Hospital's division of pulmonary biology, and head of the group that identified the proteins, said surfactant yielded by recombinant DNA techniques may have advantages over animal extracts. &quot;It would be more reproducible and there'd be no immunologic concerns&quot; of animal-borne infections, said Dr. Whitsett.    Researchers say it could be at least two years before the genetically engineered product, which has so far been tested in animals, is used in the human trials necessary before the product could be cleared for routine treatment.    Dr. Whitsett's group studied the proteins' genetic makeup, learning their structure. The researchers believe that by knowing the proteins' genetic sequence, physicians may be able to detect families at higher risk for the respiratory problem. And babies with the defect could be diagnosed in the womb, allowing infants to be treated before, or immediately after birth. One possible treatment would be to switch on or modulate the responsible genes that spur surfactant production. </TEXT></DOC>
