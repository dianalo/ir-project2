New York, like other primaries so far, did wreck someone's campaign. This time it was the S.S. Gore, which seemed to have had the misfortune of being pulled up the Hudson by a tugboat named Koch.    Like so much else in Manhattan it was fun for a day, but the belief persists that the candidates aren't saying much of substance about their presidencies. One New York paper's reporter neatly summed up the Dukakis campaign so far as &quot;emollient.&quot; Asked earlier in the week, for instance, what he thought of the strike Mr. Reagan ordered against the Iranians, Governor Dukakis said several times that he didn't have enough information to form an opinion, then offered a brief assent. Mr. Dukakis, however, is the likely Democratic nominee, so it's time to see what lies below the smooth surface.    It can't actually be said that the governor has been hiding what he stands for. The folks at Mike Dukakis for President in Boston have put many of the candidate's proposals on paper. Where Mr. Dukakis wants to take America domestically is not a mystery.    He wants to &quot;enact National Plant Closing and Worker Security Legislation&quot;; &quot;control the merger and acquisition binge&quot;; raise the minimum wage; establish a Fund to Rebuild America; invest in training and retraining workers; support temporary relief from imports for particular American industries; support Congressman Pepper's long-term health-care bill; &quot;require Medicare to pay for home health care services already covered by law&quot;; enact basic health insurance legislation for all Americans; achieve &quot;paycheck justice for all Americans&quot;; ensure affordable child care; expand federal rental assistance programs; create a National Teachers Corps; restore federal student loans; guarantee loans to all students who need them, with repayment through payroll withholding; support programs to preserve farmlands; and promote the use of Certified Public Toxics Auditors.    This is supposed to represent fresh thinking, but its animating spirit calls to mind a book published some 20 years ago, &quot;The New Industrial State,&quot; which was another set of ideas from Massachusetts.    What would it all cost? The beauty of such ideas as &quot;paycheck justice&quot; and &quot;affordable child care&quot; is that many voters will support them with their hearts, believing that their candidate, Mr. Dukakis, will have the wit to put off the costs on someone else, hopefully the people who voted for the other candidate. But supporters of Governor Dukakis's managerial state should understand that he has one other proposal:   &quot;Recognize the need for a more expansive monetary policy that encourages investment and growth.&quot; Put differently, there is no free lunch; but there's always inflation.    &quot;A more expansive monetary policy&quot; -- inflation -- is the social populist's parachute, the device that supposedly protects him and the economy from crashing abruptly back to earth. This isn't to suggest that we minimize the potential appeal of such a strategy. Initially, inflation does boil the economy, and debtors gain relief from creditors. (Albeit temporary relief, as was discovered by the people who leveraged themselves into great expanses of the farmland Mr. Dukakis wants to preserve.)    But even parachutes hit the ground eventually and President Dukakis's would be no different. The last time the U.S. endured one of these grand schemes of political engineering, it learned that wealth wasn't passing from rich to poor but into the pockets of sheiks and Third World dictators. The world economy is still digging out from the debt burden of this recycled wealth. Ironically, Mr. Dukakis seeks a &quot;flexible response&quot; to the international debt crisis that followed a cheapened dollar.    The American presidency is a big prize, and politicians running for it now tend to feel that to measure up they have to propose big programs, or at least a lot of them. Perhaps Mike Dukakis doesn't expect all, or even most, of this stuff to become policy either. Nonetheless it all adds up to something important.    In Mr. Dukakis's politics, the economic and social life of a country moves in directions consciously designed for it by the national government. Under the current administration, the country moves generally in the direction that results from the totality of the decisions made each day by its individual members. The electorate had to choose between these two distinct views in 1980, in 1984, and apparently will have to do so again in 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
