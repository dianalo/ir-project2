The company had contended that Japanese television makers conspired to sell television sets at artificially low prices in the U.S. to drive U.S. companies out of the market. In March, the Supreme Court ruled that Zenith had failed to present enough evidence in pre-trial proceedings to justify a trial of its claim. But the high court sent the dispute back to the appeals court saying it was &quot;free to consider&quot; whether Zenith had any other evidence showing an antitrust conspiracy.    The company contends the appeals court ruled on a narrow segment of the law. Zenith hasn't decided whether it might appeal to the Supreme Court, a spokesman said.    The suit was filed in 1970 by Emerson Radio, now National Union Electric Corp., Bloomington, Ill., a unit of Sweden's Electrolux Corp. In 1974, Zenith Radio Corp., succeeded by Zenith Electronics, joined the case.    The defendants included Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co., Toshiba Corp., Hitachi Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Sharp Corp. and Sanyo Electric Co. </TEXT></DOC>
