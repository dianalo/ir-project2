The half-percentage point hike in the prime _ to 10 percent _pushed the lending rate to its highest level since the spring of1985. It was the third increase in the rate so far this year andthe second in a month.   Because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixed-andadjustable-rate loans, the increase is likely to pinch thepocketbooks of consumers who already have seen borrowing costs risein recent months.   ``It will slow the economy, but it won't stop it in itstracks,'' explained Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist forthe investment firm Nikko Securities Co. International. ``That's ahealthy thing right now.   ``You try to get your flu shot before you get the flu ... That'spreventative medicine. That's what the Fed is doing.''   Economists say the rise in the prime will affect small- tomedium-sized businesses and consumers more so than largecorporations, which borrow more cheaply in the open market byissuing commercial paper, or short-term unsecured IOUs.   Home equity lines of credit are usually pegged to the banks'prime rate, while many home mortgages are tied to interest ratespaid on Treasury bills.   The financial markets took Thursday's news in stride afterweathering the storm that followed the Fed's increase in a keylending rate earlier in the week.   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closedup 5.16 to 2,039.30. Bond prices, which generally decline in theface of rising interest rates, ended mixed.   The dollar lost ground against all key foreign currencies,although the prime rate hike was credited by some European tradersfor preventing a free fall.   Chase Manhattan Bank was the first to announce the prime hikeThursday morning, with other major banks across the country quicklyfollowing suit.   The increase brings the closely watched rate to its highestlevel since June 18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5 percent from10 percent.   At the start of the year, the prime stood at 8.5 percent. It wasraised to 9 percent on May 11 and then another half percentagepoint on July 14.   The latest move had been anticipated after the Fed signaled itsdesire to tighten credit by raising its discount rate to 6.5percent from 6 percent on Tuesday, citing inflationary pressures.The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges on loans tomember banks.   Economists said banks were justified in raising the prime to thecurrent double-digit level because their own borrowing costs hadrisen. Rates banks pay on products such as certificates of depositsor money market accounts have been forced up, although not at thesame pace as bank loans.   The trend toward higher interest rates reflects prevailingconcerns in the credit markets that the economy might beoverheating and inflation creeping up.   Elizabeth G. Reiners, an economist for the investment firm DeanWitter Reynolds Inc., said the catalyst for raising the prime camefrom the rising federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loansbetween banks. That rate, which has lingered around 7.5 percent formost of the summer, surged above 8 percent at the start of businessThursday.   ``Usually there's a pretty good correlation between the spreadof fed funds and the prime rate,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
