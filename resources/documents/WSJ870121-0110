Directors of Dallas-based AMR Corp., American's parent, are expected at a meeting today to approve acquiring 15 Boeing 767 jets and 25 Airbus A-300 planes. The jets, both wide-bodies, sell for about $60 million each, indicating the total order would be valued at about $2.4 billion.    Spokesmen for Seattle-based Boeing and for Airbus declined to comment. An American Airlines spokesman acknowledged that the carrier has been talking to both manufacturers but said an agreement hadn't been completed.    The order would be unusual in several respects. Instead of buying the jets, American plans to acquire the planes on so-called &quot;walk-away&quot; leases, the industry sources said. Under these leases, the jets can be returned to the manufacturers with very short notice, in some cases as short as 30 days. This would make the acquisition extremely risky for the manufacturers.    But one top aircraft executive said competition between Boeing and Airbus has become so fierce that such leases &quot;will become the way of life -- until someone gets badly burned, stuck with a bunch of planes that can't be leased or sold, and then this walk-away lease business will stop.&quot;    The American order also would be unusual in that the airline would split it between two manufacturers. Airlines usually hold a competition that ends with a winner-take-all conclusion, partly because the carriers like to concentrate on a single type of plane to reduce maintenance and pilot-training costs, and to simplify scheduling.    In the competition for the American order, which has been going on behind the scenes for months, both manufacturers thought they would get a single order for 25 jets, an industry source said. In this way American was able to extract the best terms from each. When Boeing found the order was to be split, Boeing cut its initial offer of 25 jets to 15 for fear of undue risk, the source said.    American is now in a position to continue playing off one manufacturer against the other in future purchases. &quot;American can say to each manufacturer, 'We'll take more of your planes -- if you give us a better price,'&quot; the industry source said.    The two jets are very similar. The Boeing 767-300ER, the model involved in the American order, carries 261 passengers in a two-class seating configuration for a distance of more than 6,000 miles. The Airbus A-300-600 seats 267 passengers and has a range of about 3,800 miles.    The transaction is so risky that Pratt andamp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp., in effect dropped out of the competition to supply engines for the planes. As a result, General Electric Co. is expected to win the order for all the engines. The engine orders usually account for about 20% of the total -- or in this case nearly $500 million.    According to one airline executive, American plans to use the Airbus jets mainly on routes to the Caribbean, and perhaps transcontinental U.S. routes, while the Boeing jets would be used on longer range flights to Europe. American has been expanding its service in both areas.    Many industry executives had expected American to acquire only Boeing wide-bodies because American already has 20 767s, though different versions than the 767-300ER. Airbus's ability to win the order is thus a coup for the European consortium, composed mainly of French, West German and British manufacturers.    The order is especially significant in that it is to be placed by American, which in financial terms is one of the strongest carriers in the U.S. Until recently Airbus orders in the U.S were mainly from financially weak airlines that needed the favorable terms Airbus was willing to provide.    ---   Boeing Gets Chinese Order   SEATTLE -- Boeing Co.'s Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. unit said a division of the Chinese national airline ordered three 757-200 jetliners for a total of about $125 million.    Boeing said the Guangzhou Regional Administration of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, or CAAC, as the Chinese airline is known, plans to use the 200-seat aircraft on routes between Shanghai and Peking. Deliveries are scheduled for September and October, Boeing said.    The maker of commercial aircraft and defense contractor said the two-engine 757s will be equipped with RB211-535E4 engines produced by Rolls-Royce Ltd. of Britain.    Boeing said CAAC also converted orders for three 747-200 jumbo jets into 747-400 long-range aircraft. The 747-400s, which can fly 8,000 miles compared with the 747-200's 6,000-mile range, will be delivered in 1989 and 1990, Boeing said. The 747-400 sells for about $115 million each, compared with about $100 million for a 747-200 model. </TEXT></DOC>
