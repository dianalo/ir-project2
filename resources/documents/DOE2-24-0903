For x{ge}0.05, evidence for secondphase appears in x-ray-diffraction diagrams. Superconducting transitiontemperature T/sub c/ falls systematically with increasing x. The systematicvariations in T/sub c/ and lattice parameters with nominal x suggestthat Ga solid solution may extend to x = 0.05. However, electron microproberesults indicate that Ga incorporation into the superconducting phaseis extremely limited; the Ga content x of the superconducting phase appearsto be x{le}0.01. A Ga-rich second phase is also observed by microprobefor 0.01{le}x{le}0.10.</TEXT></DOC>
