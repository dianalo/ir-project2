Computed tomography (CT) has been demonstrated to be a valuablemodality in the detection and differential diagnosis of these abnormalitieswith a sensitivity, according to results, of approx. 86%. CT will identifythe exact location, shape and density of the lesion and demonstrate theeffect of the lesion on adjacent structures. The use of i.v. contrastmaterial in CT imaging permits the accurate visualisation of wall thicknessand its characteristics. Magnetic resonance (MR) is the latest modalityadded to the study of pathological changes of the neck. 29 refs.; 13figs.</TEXT></DOC>
