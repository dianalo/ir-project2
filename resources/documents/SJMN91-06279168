Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,said failure to retaliate against the Canadians would have cost U.S.manufacturers $600 million in annual sales and 15,000 jobs -- &quot;tantamount toan act of trade war.&quot;;   &quot;I believe that these steps will prevent subsidizedCanadian lumber imports from forcing American mills to close,&quot; Sen. MaxBaucus, D-Mont., said Friday. &quot;I am confident that this final duty will behigher than the interim duty.&quot;;   Canadian Trade Minister Michael Wilson saidin a statement Friday that the U.S. investigation of Canadian lumber importsis groundless and Canada will fight it.;   Canada agreed to collect the tax onits side of the border in 1986 when the U.S. Commerce Department threatened toimpose a 15 percent fee based on its findings that subsidized lumber wasflooding U.S. markets.;   Canada maintains the subsidies no longer exist, butU.S. officials disagree.;   The United States imported $2.6 billion inCanadian softwood lumber in 1990, about three-fourths of that from BritishColumbia.;   The United States has initiated its own countervailing duty probeonly once before, in a case involving Japanese semiconductors, a sign of theseriousness of the matter, Commerce Under secretary Michael Farren said. Hesaid President Bush made the final decision on Friday's action.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911005  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  12F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  355  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, October 5, 199100279168,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
