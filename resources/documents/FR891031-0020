Office of the Assistant General Counsel (Enforcement),(202) 566-2941.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Bank Secretary Act, Public Law91-508, (codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951, <T3>et seq., </T3>and 31 U.S.C. 5311-5326), authorizes the Secretary ofthe Treasury to require financial institutions to keep records and filereports that the Secretary determines have a high degree or usefulnessin criminal, tax, and regulatory matters. The primary purpose of the Actis to identify the sources, volumes and movements of monies moving intoand out of the country and through domestic financial institutions. <T3>See </T3>H.R. Rep. No. 975, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 11-13 (1970). In exercisingthis far reaching authority, Treasurey has been mindful of issues concerningundue interference with foreign laws and has been careful not to createobstacles to the free flow of legitimate international trade and commerce.H.R. Rep. No. 975 at 13.Under 31 U.S.C. 5314, the Secretary may require reports or records relatingto transactions between persons subject to the jurisdiction of the UnitedStates and ``foreign financial agencies'', <T3>e.g., </T3>financial institutions located abroad. In addition, pursuantto 31 U.S.C. 5318(a)(2), the Secretary may require that domestic financialinstitutions ``maintain appropriate procedures'' to ensure compliance withany regulation prescribed under section 5314 or any other provision in31 U.S.C. 5311-5326. Treasury will be exercising its authority unde theseprovisions to address the problem of ``laundering'' drug and other illegalproceeds through the international payments system, particularly throughinternational wire transfers of funds. International wire transfers offunds include transactions where either (1) a foreign office of a financialinstitution instructs a U.S. office of a financial institution to effecta payment in the U.S., directly or indirectly, or (2) where a U.S. officeof a financial institution instructs a foreign office of a financial institutionto effect a payment abroad, directly or indirectly. (The term does notinclude check or ACH payments.)World-wide gross drug revenues are estimated to be $300 billion. Illegaldrug revenues in the United States are estimated to total $110 billion.Estimates are that only 20% of the money generated from narcotics traffickinggoes to the cost of goods sold, with 80% available for profits. These profitsare used to finance other narcotics and criminal activities, purchase luxuryitems, make investmens in real estate and acquire legitimate businesses.Money laundering is a vital component of drug trafficking and other criminalactivity throughout the world. Criminals must ``wash'' their ``dirty''money to make it appear ``clean.'' As President Bush recently stated,<ITAG tagnum="21">Drug money undermines honest businesses, corrupts political institutions,and even threatens the security of nations. To conceal their obscene profits,drug barons must wash their money by cycling it through financial institutionsand illegitimate shell corporations. </ITAG>Currently, illegal funds are being transferred from or to the United Statesand ``cycled'' through intricate money laundering schemes involving internationalpayments, particularly wire transfers. Several recent money launderingoperations, which have been discovered by Treasury and other federal lawenforcement agencies, such as Operations C-Chase and Polar Cap, are testamentsto this phenomenon. In an April 28, 1989, submission to the Director, Officeof National Drug Control Policy, reprinted in the Congressional Recordof May 18, 1989, the American Bankers Association stated that, ``Wire transfers,which are essentially unregulated, have emerged as the primary method bywhich high volume launderers ply their trade.'' 135 Cong. Rec. S5555 (May18, 1989).To date Treasury has used its Bank Secrecy Act authority to require financialinstitutions to keep records of all requests, advices and instructionsrelating to international transfers of more than $10,000 to or from anyperson or account outside the United States. 31 CFR 103.33(b). Under thisprovision, a financial institution must keep a record of each internationaltransaction over $10,000, including all international wire transfers offunds and book transfers of credit. Currently, Treasury does not specifywhat type of information must be contained in the record. Thus, financialinstitutions are not required to obtain or record information from or aboutthe identity of an originator or beneficiary of a payment, about the partieson whose behalf the originator or beneficiary may be acting, or other informationbeyond what is in their records or necessary to make the transfer.In addition to the current recordkeeping requirements for wire transfers,Treasury is authorized to require financial institutions to report transactions,including international wire transfers of funds, with foreign financialinstitutions in a designated location for a limited period of time pursuantto 31 CFR 103.25. This authority is limited by the fact that financialinstitutions involved in international wire transfers of funds frequentlydo not have complete information about the originator or beneficiary ofpayments.Treasury is reviewing a number of regulatory options under the authorityof 31 U.S.C. 5314 and 5318 to deal with these deficiencies and the severemoney laundering problem. In our regulatory review, we will give carefulconsideration to the question of reaching an appropriate balance betweenlaw enforcement needs, the importance of free capital flow in global commerceand an efficient international financial network, and the potential burdenon financial institutions. This is difficult given the severity of themoney laundering problem and the enormous daily volume of internationalpayments, the overwhelming majority of which represent normal commercialtransactions. Therefore, Treasury is soliciting views of financial institutions,law enforcement officials, regulatory agencies, and other interested partieson these or other regulatory options. After Treasury analyzes the commentsreceived in response to the Advance Notice, it expects to issue a Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking with specific regulatory proposals for comment.The following list illustrates some of the regulatory options under consideration.Treasury seeks views on each of these proposals. However, these proposalsare not meant to be considered as mutually exclusive alternatives; theymay be later proposed in combination with one another. With respect toany possible reporting requirement, Treasury would propose that reportingcould be made by electronic data transmission.1. Require a record or report by the financial institution originatingor receiving an international wire transfer of funds for a customer whichincludes identifying and account information about the originator, beneficiaryand the person on whose behalf the payment is being made or received andwhether the sender or receiver is aware of any separate payment instructionsregarding the payment unknown to the financial institution. This requirementmight be coupled with some type of an exemption system designed to coverthe majority of normal business transactions. 2. Require that all international wire transfer messages contain all knownthird party identifying information, <T3>e.g.</T3>, account numbers, addresses, and names of the originatorand beneficiary of the payment. 3. Require that, prior to originating international payments on a customer'sbehalf, either through book entry transfers of credit or through internationalwire transfers of funds, financial institutions apply model ``know yourcustomer'' procedures to verify the legitimate nature of the customer'sbusiness and that the transfers are commensurate with legitimate businessactivities. 4. Require special identification procedures and recordkeeping or reportingof international payments sent or received by persons without establishedaccount relationships at financial institutions. 5. Require that financial institutions develop a suspicious internationalwire transfer profile and report suspicious payments to Treasury. The profilemight include certain criteria suggested by Treasury, for example, thepresence of large currency deposits prior to an outgoing transfer or theexistence of an incoming transfer followed by issuance of a cashier's check.6. Require that (A) when an institution, typically a bank, receives a targetingorder under 31 CFR 103.25 relating to international wire transfers of funds,it must obtain, to the extent possible, information from other domesticbanks involved in the transfer regarding the identity of the originatoror beneficiary of the transfer, and (B) that those other domestic bankscooperate in providing this information on a timely basis to the targetedinstitution. 7. Provide that an additional category of information may be requestedthrough a regulation issued under 31 CFR 103.25, relating to internationalbook transfers of credit not involving wire transfers, <T3>e.g.,</T3> transfers of credit between U.S. and foreign offices ofa financial institution.This list is not meant to be exhaustive of the ways in which Treasury'sregulatory authority might be used to address the problem. Treasury isopen to other suggestions from financial institutions or other interestedparties regarding additional or alternative regulatory measures or voluntaryprograms. Treasury requests that financial institutions that have dealt with theissue of money laundering through international payments share their experienceswith Treasury, for instance, on efforts to isolate suspicious wire transfersor to impose ``know your customer'' procedures. We would like financialinstitutions to advise of their policies and procedures for ``pay on properID'' payments or other arrangements whereby noncustomers can receive (orsend) international payments. Treasury also is interested in comments onany practical problems presented by these options and on the estimatedcosts of compliance. We welcome recommendations on how best to fashionan appropriate exemption system if routine recordkeeping or reporting requirementsare adopted. Finally, we welcome comments relating to specific problemswhich might arise with foreign jurisdictions, such as foreign constraintson U.S. jurisdiction and enforcement abilities.Treasury is committed to the effective and judicious use of its Bank SecrecyAct authority and wishes to work with the affected financial institutionsand law enforcement community to fashion a responsible regulatory solutionto the problem at hand. We look forward to the full cooperation and participationof financial institutions on this regulatory project.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Salvatore R.
