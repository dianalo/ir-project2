Three of the birds arrived at the town buzzard's roost at 6:32a.m. with Metroparks Ranger Capt. Roger Lutz on hand to record theevent.   Buzzard spotting each March 15 in Hinckley has become an annualsign of spring in northeast Ohio.   Lutz said a flock of about 80 buzzards migrates to the park inthe small town 20 miles from Cleveland. The migration route of thescavenger birds remains a mystery.
