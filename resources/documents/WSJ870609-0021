Judge John F. Keenan, who said he would issue a written opinion this morning, made his ruling after a hearing yesterday. Harcourt attorney Sheldon Raab had argued at the hearing that a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction against the dividend sought by British Printing would &quot;send a signal that there is something wrong with the recapitalization,&quot; driving down the stock's price.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Harcourt closed yesterday at $57.625 a share, down 25 cents.    John Berardi, Harcourt's chief financial officer, declined last night to comment on the judge's decision until he has seen the ruling.    As previously reported, the Orlando, Fla.-based publishing, entertainment and insurance concern proposed the recapitalization plan to shake off British Printing's attempt to take over the company. British Printing, an Oxford, England-based publishing and printing concern, is controlled by British media magnate Robert Maxwell.    Under the recapitalization, Harcourt would take on almost $3 billion in debt and pay holders a special common share dividend of $40 a share in cash, plus a fraction of a share of newly issued preferred stock. Yesterday was the record date of the special dividend.    Nancy Barton, a British Printing attorney, argued at the hearing that Harcourt &quot;created the problem themselves by acting so hastily. They were trying to stampede the debenture holders into conversion.&quot;    Harcourt, which wanted holders to convert their debentures into common stock, faces a question on the status of debentures that remain unconverted after the record date for the special dividend. The trustee for the debentures said it will contest any claim that bond-holders would lose conversion privileges. Harcourt has asked a Florida state court for a ruling. </TEXT></DOC>
