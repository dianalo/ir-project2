Ms. McKinzie, a 41-year-old former business manager andexecutive consultant for the thrift's late president, alsowas ordered to pay $13.4 million in restitution to theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp.</LP><TEXT>   Ms. McKinzie was ordered Friday by Judge Alicemarie H.Stotler to begin serving her prison term immediately. Ms.McKinzie's attorney, Richard &quot;Racehorse&quot; Haynes of Texas,filed a notice of appeal at the sentencing hearing, saidDavid Schindler, one of the two assistant U.S. attorneys whoprosecuted the case. Neither Ms. McKinzie nor her attorneycould be reached.   After an eight-week trial, a jury found Ms. McKinzieguilty in March of stealing $15.5 million from North AmericaSavings. She was convicted on 22 criminal counts, includingracketeering, conspiracy, wire and bank fraud and interstatetransportation of stolen property.   Federal banking and thrift regulators say the sentence wasamong the toughest ever levied for fraud. Last month, WoodyLemons was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role indefrauding a Texas thrift. That sentence also is beingappealed.   &quot;The government considers the sentence to be appropriatein light of the egregious misconduct of McKinzie,&quot; the twoprosecutors said in a statement. The demise of North AmericaSavings is expected to eventually cost taxpayers $118million.   Ms. McKinzie had pleaded innocent because of insanity. Herattorneys had argued that her judgment was impaired byprescription drugs she was taking.   Duayne D. Christensen, a Westminster, Calif., dentist,invested $6.4 million to open the thrift in 1983. Ms.McKinzie was a consultant to Dr. Christensen in operating thethrift. In 1986, the concern lost $8.9 million in the first11 months. Government prosecutors charged that the two liveda lavish life style, using thrift funds to buy Rolls-Royceautos, a $125,000 gold eagle statue and an $18,500 goldletter-opener.   In 1987, a week before federal regulators declared thethrift insolvent, Dr. Christensen, 57 years old, died whenhis Jaguar crashed into a freeway overpass. The Orange countycoroner classified the cause of his death as undetermined,failing to rule whether it was an accident or suicide.   Federal regulators have also filed a civil suit seeking$40 million for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty inthe case, an FDIC attorney said. &quot;This sentencing was a verygratifying victory, but it could also speed things up in ourcivil case,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
