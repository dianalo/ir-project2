In addition,the crystalline structure study of the Hf/sub 2/Fe compound was performed.The results of the EQI measurement show the presence of two independentinteractions, one at low frequency, characterized by {omega}/sub Q//sup(1)/=33 Mrad/s and {delta}=30%, and the other at high frequency describedby {omega}/sub Q//sup (2)/=207+-2 Mrad/s and {delta}=4%. Both interactionsare found to be compatible with the crystalline structure establishedin this investigation. The large temperature dependence of the electricfield gradient of the second interaction in the range from 78 K to 1183K was determined. The change in the EFG follows the empirical T/sup 3/2/-relation.</TEXT></DOC>
