StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JAPAN EUROP CANDA FRESTMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The dollar was hammered again in foreign exchange trading yesterday as news of a widened U.S. trade deficit seemed to confirm widespread bearish sentiment on the currency.    Several major central banks again reportedly mounted a coordinated support operation for the U.S. currency against the yen, but the dollar still slid to a post-World War II low against the Japanese currency.    The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, had its biggest one-day fall in over a decade, largely because of the narrowing interest-rate spread between Canada and the U.S. For much of this year, the Canadian dollar has risen on heavy capital inflows, particularly from Japan as investors there diversified out of U.S. dollar holdings.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 140.80 yen, down 1.1% from 142.33 Monday. In intraday trading, it touched 140.60 yen, a postwar low. The previous low was 141.60, established Friday.    In early trading Wednesday in Tokyo, the dollar stood at 140.68 yen.    In Washington yesterday, the Commerce Department said the U.S. trade gap widened to $15.06 billion in February, a worse showing than economists generally expected but better than some recent market rumors. The January trade deficit was revised to $12.27 billion from the $14.78 billion preliminary report.    &quot;The longer it takes to show some nominal impact on the trade deficit . . . the lower the dollar should go,&quot; Richard Witten, vice president, foreign exchange, at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., New York, said.    The dollar had its biggest losses before the Commerce Department report as dealers expected bad news. The currency's drop prompted several central banks to step into the market, selling yen to buy dollars, apparently in accordance with a multilateral agreement to stabilize exchange rates.    Traders said the Bank of Japan intervened in Tokyo trading, and in Europe the Bank of France, the Swiss National Bank and the West German Bundesbank reportedly entered the market. The Swiss central bank confirmed its intervention but wouldn't disclose details; the others wouldn't comment.    Despite the apparent central bank activity, which followed last week's reaffirmation of an accord among major industrial nations to enforce currency stability, foreign exchange traders were unperturbed.    &quot;The market doesn't seem to fear intervention at all,&quot; said Joseph Volpicella, executive vice president, foreign exchange, at Spavo Financial Corp., a New York-based money manager. &quot;It's also perceived as half-hearted intervention because the U.S. is a reluctant participant,&quot; he said.    It wasn't clear whether the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened yesterday.    The dollar also fell 0.6% against the West German mark to 1.7963 marks from 1.8071.    The Canadian dollar tumbled to 75.52 U.S. cents from 76.73 cents Monday. Traders cited unconfirmed reports that Japanese institutions are liquidating Canadian dollar investments and repatriating the funds to Japan, where the Tokyo stock market is at a record high.    Interest-rate spreads between Canada and the U.S., which traditionally are 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 percentage points, were as narrow as 80 basis points, or eight-tenths of a percentage point, yesterday morning as U.S. rates rose. Canadian rates rose later, widening the spread beyond one percentage point.    &quot;The psychology of the stronger (Canadian) dollar has been broken,&quot; said Paul Kovacs, senior economist at Burns Fry Ltd., a Toronto securities firm. Investors in the Canadian currency, he said, decided to take profits.    Rod Fowler, foreign exchange manager at Wood Gundy Inc., said that the Canadian dollar had been overbought and that the recent sudden rise in short-term U.S. interest rates &quot;spooked the market.&quot;    The Canadian dollar had been rising steadily from its Jan. 1 level of 72.44 U.S. cents as Japanese money poured into North America. Canada's resource-based markets were particularly favored on expectations of higher commodity prices in a more inflationary environment. Canadian stock markets were sharply lower yesterday.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery soared $13.80 an ounce to $450.90 in heavy trading. The estimated volume was 6.3 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $448.58.    ---                  LATE NEW YORK TRADING                Tuesday, April 14, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
