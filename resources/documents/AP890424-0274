WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States and the European EconomicCommunity are near an agreement in their dispute over an EEC ban onimports of U.S. beef treated with growth-boosting hormones, a Dutchofficial said Monday.   U.S. officials have agreed to let the EEC certify U.S. beef dueto be exported to the EEC as having been raised without the use ofhormones, Dutch Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Yvonne vanRooy said.   The tentative accord, reached by a U.S-EEC panel of experts,``has solved 80 percent of the problem,'' Mrs. Van Rooy toldreporters outside an EEC foreign ministers meeting.   An official at the U.S. mission to the EEC in Brussels declinedto comment except to say that negotiations were continuing.   EEC External Relations Commissioner Frans Andriessen briefed theforeign ministers on the tentative agreement.   ``There was general satisfaction (among the EEC states) that theAmericans have agreed in principle to a certification system,''said an EEC source, who asked not to be named.   Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, the Spanish minister who chairedthe ministers meeting, said it was ``still too early to say whatthe outcome of the (hormone) conflict will be.'' But, he toldreporters, he ``glimpsed the possibility of a solution.''   Under the accord, EEC inspectors at U.S. meat plants wouldcertify no hormones were used to raise beef due to shipped to anyof the 12 EEC nations.   But the EEC source said U.S. and EEC officials ``have yet toquantify how much beef could be exported to the Community under thecertification procedure, including offal that is used in meatproducts. The question remains if it (the United States) couldstill export the same amount of beef as it did previously.''   The EEC, citing health reasons, banned all imports ofhormone-treated meat as of Jan. 1. The ban affects about $100million in U.S. beef to the EEC annually.   Initially, it was to affect $140 million but this was reducedafter the EEC agreed to exclude beef used for pet food.   The U.S. has threatened to retaliate against EEC imports. That,in turn, led the EEC to threaten counter-retaliatory measuresagainst U.S. exports of walnuts and dried fruit.   A special EEC-U.S. task force was formed Feb. 18 to study theissue as both sides agreed to hold off on any retaliation during a75-day ``cooling off period.''   ``The United States has agreed to a certification policy'' underwhich it would vouch that beef sent to the EEC was not raised ongrowth-boosting hormones, Mrs. Van Rooy said.   ``This is a success for Europe. The United States has shown tobe sufficiently realistic.''   The EEC considers the use of such hormones harzardous to thehealth of consumers. The United States has maintained there is noscientific base for that.   The cooling off period ends in early May. It was instituted toprevent a trade war and allow the Bush administration come to gripswith the issue which it inherited from the Reagan administration.</TEXT></DOC>
