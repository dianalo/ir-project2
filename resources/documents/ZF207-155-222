 But terminology can muddy the issue.andM;Many users refer to local area network topologies and protocol standardsinterchangeably, but actually they are quite different.andP;  Even networkmanufacturers mix protocol with topology references unless their products areexceptions.andM;For example, Ethernet is a protocol standard that may be configured in avariety of topologies.andP;  The same is true for token-ring or fiber-opticnetworks.andP;  However, when most people refer to Ethernet, they think of a bustopology.andP;  Likewise, they think of a ring configuration for token-ring and astar arrangement for fiber optics.andM;Standardization on network protocols is improving, with many small suppliersnow capable of easy interconnection with the outside world and other LANs.andM;One concern is the interaction of network operating systems supplied bydifferent vendors.andP;  Individual workstations must be able to communicateacross all the subnetworks and clusters.andP;  That requires careful selection ofbridges and gateways, and often means that the network must be supplied by asingle vendor to ensure transparent compatibility.andM;Virtually all large government installations today come from Novell Inc.,andO;3Com Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., or, in the case of secure installations,10Net Communications, Marietta, Ga.andM;The preeminence of Novell and 3Com networks in government reflects theirmarket control in the private sector.andP;  Many users say that sticking to thesedominant suppliers ensures easy connectivity; others care so much about aless-known product's superb performance of a particular function that theyare willing to pay the price of difficult interconnections with othersystems.andM;For isolated work group clusters, the system chosen has no such requirementsoutside the work group itself.andM;One of the most common configuration among large government networks is anEthernet backbone with token-ring, fiber-optic, Ethernet or TCP/IP branches.andO;The reason is that a large government LAN often has many work group clustersand interconnections to other networks, mainframes and wide area networks.andM;Among the advantages of the Ethernet bus configuration is reliability.andP;  Ifone bus workstation fails, the rest still can access the network server.andO;That is not always true with other configurations.andM;When security is an issue for defense or financial applications, fiber opticsis the preferred choice.andP;  Fiber-optic networks adhere increasingly to theemerging fiber-optic network standard whose configuration usually is a star.andM;Ethernet on FiberandM;The fiber-optic network's central hub ensures that loss of one node does notnecessarily cause the rest of the network to fail.andP;  Fiber nets can use theEthernet protocol even though the transmission medium is glass fiber insteadof the more common coaxial cable.andM;Another topology favored in government is the token-ring work group clusteron an Ethernet bus backbone.andM;This configuration requires an Ethernet-to-token-ring bridge, whicheffectively isolates the work group from the rest of the network.andM;Failures within the ring are not transmitted to the rest of the network; onlythe work group goes out of service.andP;  The backbone, meanwhile, can communicatewith other work groups, servers, networks or hardware platforms.andM;Although there are exceptions, it appears that smaller or physicallyself-contained work groups in government agencies favor token-ring clusters.andM;As several groups begin to share data or other resources, the clusters areintereconnected on an Ethernet bus or backbone.andP;  When the size of the networkexceeds the practical limits of the 10-MHz Ethernet, it gets replaced by abroadband backbone.andM;The backbone has other functions as well.andP;  From the Ethernet bus, a TCP/IPlink may connect the LAN to a UNIX network or other dissimilar installation.andO;The backbone also is a good location for a communications server orconcentrator to connect the LAN and its work groups to an external wide areanetwork.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
