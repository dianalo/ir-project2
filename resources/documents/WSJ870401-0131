Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa again pledged that the government will deliver strong measures during the spring to spur economic growth.    In its unemployment report, the statistics bureau of the prime minister's office said that Japanese joblessness fell to a seasonally adjusted 2.9% of the labor force in February from 3% -- a post-World War II record -- in January. But officials called the drop small and said that the number of job holders, which rose by only 150,000 from a year earlier, to 57.03 million, hadn't increased as much as expected.    Unemployment among women reached a record 3.1%, while the rate among men was 2.9%.    Employment in the manufacturing industry declined by 430,000 workers from the year before, as companies continued to lay off workers because of the slump stemming from the yen's strength. As the strong currency has raised the cost of Japanese exports, manufacturers here have been reducing production and employment. That has brought Japanese unemployment to levels that are unprecedented for the country although low by the standards of many other industrialized nations.    In a separate report, the Economic Planning Agency said that Japan's leading economic indicator rose to a reading of 75.0 in January from 50.0 in December. The agency considers a figure above 50.0 to be an indication that the economy will expand in the near future. But despite January's increase, agency officials said they will have to wait before they can conclude that the economy may have emerged from its slump.    &quot;It's too early to say from these statistics that the economy may start recovering,&quot; one official said. &quot;Production and other indicators are getting strong, but there is still weakness in the employment sector.&quot;    With the statistics as a background, Prime Minister Nakasone and Finance Minister Miyazawa said yesterday that the government will introduce strong stimulative steps in the spring. Addressing the budget committee of parliament's upper house, both officials indicated that the government is ready to ease its policy of fiscal restraint.    Mr. Nakasone also hinted that the government may introduce a supplementary budget in autumn in an effort to sustain the stimulative efforts to be unveiled in the spring.    During a meeting earlier yesterday with Deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru, Mr. Nakasone noted that he has instructed the director-general of the Economic Planning Agency to consider &quot;epoch-making economic plans.&quot;    Japan pledged in February to introduce a stimulative package as soon as parliament finishes work on the budget for the fiscal year that begins today. A dispute over the planned introduction of a sales tax has delayed completion of the budget; yesterday, the upper house of parliament approved a stop-gap budget, which the lower house had already approved.    In addition to calls from within Japan that he do more to stimulate the economy, Mr. Nakasone is being pressured by Japan's trading partners, especially the U.S., to make his country's economy less dependent on exports.    Although the yen had been relatively stable against the dollar earlier this year, it has risen sharply over the past week. And Japan is facing additional trade pressure following the announcement last Friday that the U.S. planned to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to live up to a semiconductor-trade accord. </TEXT></DOC>
