The proposed deal, which would resolve several of thefraud suits brought against the pop duo and its U.S. recorddistributor, excludes all but four Chicago law firms from its$670,000 attorneys' fees provision. Lawyers who weren't partof the arrangement had previously argued that the terms wereunfair to consumers, but yesterday acknowledged that theyfelt cheated out of fees.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The attempt by the (Chicago) group to limit the award ofattorneys' fees to themselves is inappropriate,&quot; wrotelawyers at the Philadelphia law firm Levin, Fishbein, Sedranandamp; Berman in a memorandum submitted in preparation foryesterday's arguments. Attached was a request claiming feesand expenses for the Levin firm and three others totalingabout $174,000.   Lawyers at Levin Fishbein couldn't be reached for comment.   Clint Krislov, another lawyer who is objecting to thesettlement, said that the excluded lawyers' objections wereaimed at preventing the record company from &quot;keeping profitsfrom something everybody knows now was a fraud.&quot;   Mr. Krislov, of Chicago, added: &quot;The fact is, we'd like toactually litigate this and determine what the actual amountof damages is, who's responsible, and recover a fair amountfor the class.&quot;   Last fall, The Wall Street Journal reported that at least26 suits had been filed across the country, mostly on behalfof people connected to lawyers who stood to win hundreds ofthousands of dollars in fees. The scandal over the musicalgroup, which has conceded that it didn't perform the songs onits hit album, attracted dozens of lawyers, including topfirms known for filing shareholder suits against companiesinvolved in leveraged buyouts.   Since then, many of the cases have been abandoned ordismissed, but about eight are still seeking approval tobecome class actions in state and federal courts around thecountry. The Chicago settlement wouldn't automaticallydispose of the remaining actions. Lawyers for the recordcompany, however, said they will ask other courts to abide bythe terms of the agreement, which calls for the AristaRecords unit of Bertelsmann AG, Germany, to send partialrefund checks to people who can prove they bought MilliVanilli music, merchandise or concert tickets before the popduo admitted the fake in 1990.   Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas O'Brien said yesterdaythat he would make a final ruling March 10 on the settlement.   Lawyers for the record company said it would be&quot;inappropriate&quot; to comment on the hearing before the judgeissues his final ruling. But Peter Parcher, Arista's trialcounsel, said: &quot;We think that Judge O'Brien said it all whenhe said (yesterday), `I wonder whether anybody would be hereif not for the fact of attorneys' fees.'&quot;   ---   STUDENT NEWSPAPER WINS university disciplinary records.   In a county superior court in Atlanta, the University ofGeorgia student newspaper won access to records of a studentdisciplinary board's hazing probe. The decision is the firstto allow such access since a 1974 Congressional privacy act.   That act, called the Buckley Amendment, withheld federalfunding from universities that disclosed any student recordsbesides basic directory information. Universities often citethe amendment in withholding information found in internalinvestigations, and the University of Georgia used it toargue that the disciplinary board's records should be keptfrom the student paper, called the Red andamp; Black.   But Judge Frank M. Hull said the amendment didn't applybecause it allows a university to keep its funding if a courtforces it to open the records. The judge also said the hazingdocuments were disciplinary records, not &quot;educational&quot;documents protected by the amendment.   &quot;The decision could have major impact, depending on howother states interpret it,&quot; said Mark Goodman, executivedirector of the Student Press Law Center in Washington, D.C.&quot;There are a lot of things that go on on campuses, in theirjustice systems, that the public doesn't know about.&quot;   The judge didn't allow the newspaper access to actualdisciplinary board meetings, however, because he said theboard is not a governmental body as defined by Georgia's OpenMeetings Act.   An attorney for the student paper, Anthony E. DiResta,said the paper might appeal that part of the decision.Lawyers for the university said they hadn't seen the decisionand could not comment.   The judge put a 30-day stay on disclosing the recordspending a possible appeal by the university.   (Red andamp; Black Publishing Co.

Reversing two lower courts, New York's high court ruledthat insurers don't have to cover homeowner's policyholderswho have been sued for alleged child abuse in their home. TheNew York Court of Appeals found that sexual abuse of childrenis not covered because it is an intentional act. Such actsare excluded in standard homeowners policies.   Insurance lawyers said the decision was important becausethere are more than 100 suits involving New Yorkpolicyholders seeking insurance coverage for allegations ofsexual abuse of children. They said New York joins 23 otherstates limiting coverage for sexual abuse of children.   In the case decided yesterday, a couple in HuntingtonStation, N.Y., faced a civil suit brought by the mother oftwo children that the husband allegedly sexually abused whilehis wife was babysitting for them. The husband denied theallegations and criminal charges related to the case weredismissed.   &quot;Until now it has been an open question in New York as towhether&quot; sexual abuse of children is covered by homeowner'sinsurance, said Joseph L. Forstadt, an attorney at Stroock andamp;Stroock andamp; Lavan who argued the case on behalf of AllstateInsurance Co., a unit of Sears Roebuck andamp; Co., Chicago.   Mitchell Gittin, who represented the policyholders, saidthat the decision broadened the extent of the exclusion fromcoverage of intentional acts, since there had never been afinding that his clients were responsible for the allegedabuse.
