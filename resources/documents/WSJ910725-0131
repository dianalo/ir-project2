Over the next few years, as the systems advance, the newtype of computer could lead to more creative scientificanalysis, just as the computerized spreadsheet allowed forfaster, more imaginative business analysis.</LP><TEXT>   The new breed of machine, exemplified by a deviceInternational Business Machines Corp. unveiled yesterday inNew York, has supercomputer-class power but costs perhaps atenth as much and is much easier to use because its hardwareand software are designed specifically to handlevisualization problems.   Currently, supercomputers are often used to handleproblems such as putting into pictures the reams of satellitedata on the ozone hole over the South Pole. But scientistsmust jump through hoops to book time on scarcesupercomputers.   At the other end of the spectrum, workstations arebecoming fast enough and their graphics capabilities robustenough to handle some simulations. But even a fastworkstation might take hours to produce one frame in ananimated simulation of a complex weather system.   IBM addressed the speed problem by producing a specializedcomputer that uses 32 Intel Corp. i860 processors in a waythat lets the machine, called the Power Visualization System,do as many as 2.5 billion so-called floating point operationsa second. That's well into the supercomputer league innumber-crunching, but the machine will cost $600,000 to $2million, compared with perhaps $20 million for asupercomputer. That price is affordable for some big researchinstitutions and corporations, and it should come downsignificantly over the next couple of years.   &quot;IBM's machine is way out there in terms of performance,&quot;said Daniel Brady, manager of the National Center forSupercomputing Applications in Urbana-Champaign, Ill. He saidsuch performance is crucial, because it will help scientiststurn their data into films, not just static images. &quot;Withmotion,&quot; he said, &quot;there's a whole other layer of the brainthat kicks in&quot; when analyzing a problem.   IBM researchers, for instance, have a piece of video,produced in seconds using their system, that shows the ozonelayer spinning so rapidly around the South Pole that pieceswould occasionally go flying off through the SouthernHemisphere. That effect, which sheds some light on changes inthe ozone layer, wasn't obvious from the still pictures thatsatellites have collected.   The lack of affordable computing power currently is soacute that scientists have closely examined only 1% of thedata spacecraft have sent back to Earth. As a result, it took10 years for scientists to realize there was an alarming holein the ozone layer.   Malvin Kalos, director of the Cornell University TheoryCenter, a test site for the IBM machine, said anotherscientist recently used the IBM machine to simulate amolecule's electrical properties. He asked him to change someassumptions in the model, and the new image appearedimmediately.   &quot;It was very vivid, and it happened before I could getbored,&quot; Mr. Kalos said. &quot;It makes a big difference to be ableto see something right away and not have to go away for anhour and come back.&quot;   Researchers say they expect lots of manufacturers toaddress the visualization problem, many by helping scientistsavoid having to spend days or weeks producing programs thatrepresent data visually. For instance, Silicon Graphics Inc.this week introduced a software tool that lets researchersbuild programs out of blocks for its graphics workstations,much as a child might produce a structure out of Lego blocks.Stardent, a maker of high-powered workstations, has a similarproduct available, and IBM took much the same approach withits visualization system.   IBM researchers said they expect a competitor to introducesoon a specialized piece of hardware to handle visualization,though they declined to identify the competitor or speculateabout the product. In any case, the supercomputer andminisupercomputer companies will continue to tackle the issueby speeding up their hardware as fast as possible, a processthat historically has increased computing power 10-fold everyfive years or so.   &quot;This is a very active field,&quot; said Forest Baskett, vicepresident of research and development at Silicon Graphics.&quot;It's wonderful to see all this activity, because{visualization} makes a world of difference.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
