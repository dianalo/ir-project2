Clark Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ECO </IN><TEXT>   The boom in capital spending appears to be losing some of its steam.    Some companies plan major spending increases next year, and others expect to continue outlays at about this year's high levels. But others are trimming spending, in some cases bracing for a business slowdown or a recession, either next year or in 1990. In addition, increased stress is being placed on projects to increase efficiency, not add to capacity.    The net result, according to the consulting firm of Data Resources Inc., will be that business -- fixed investment next year will rise by an inflation-adjusted 4.8%, still a strong gain, but a sharp slowdown from the record 11.1% gain Data Resources expects this year.    The Lexington, Mass., consulting firm expects all of next year's gain to be in outlays for equipment to increase productivity, not for structures required when companies boost output. The brokerage firm of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., offers almost an identical forecast of next year's spending gain -- 4.8% -- and adds, &quot;Structures are past their peak for this cycle.&quot;    This year's record gain in capital outlays follows a modest rise of 2.7% in 1987. This year's boost, together with exports, has helped maintain the business expansion as consumer spending has slowed slightly. The expansion will be six years old in November, a peacetime record, and a smaller increase in capital spending next year could help slow the overall economy. Contemplating that fact, John M. Godfrey, chief economist of Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville, Fla., says, &quot;Consumer spending will have to remain strong next year if the expansion is to endure.&quot;    One businessman worried about the economic outlook is Richard R. Allen, chief financial officer of Ladd Furniture Co., High Point, N.C. His company expects a &quot;modest recession&quot; in its industry beginning late next year, so it is shifting spending from expanding capacity to increasing productivity. &quot;We think that being the low-cost producer gives you strength as you go through a soft period.&quot;    International Paper Co. of Purchase, N.Y., completed an eight-year, $7 billion primary-mill rebuilding program in 1987. Next year, it plans to concentrate on what it calls &quot;de-bottlenecking&quot; projects -- improvements to increase the speed, efficiency and output of plant machinery. The company expects to spend between $800 million and $900 million in 1989, up from $750 million this year.    Scott Paper Co. of Philadelphia, another big paper company facing strong demand, plans to spend between $450 million and $500 million in 1988, and &quot;most likely&quot; will spend more in 1989.    Like International Paper, Rohr Industries Inc., a Chula Vista, Calif., producer of aerospace parts, has just completed a major capacity-expanding program. Next year, it will cut outlays to $55 million from the 1988 level of $76 million. A spokesman said: &quot;We will be focusing on improving and modernizing existing facilities, not on adding capacity.&quot;    Deere andamp; Co., the Moline, Ill., farm-equipment maker, expects capital outlays next year to rise 15% to 20% to about $315 million. Although it expects the 1989 farm economy to be strong, a Deere spokesman said next year's outlays will be mainly for upgrading and buying new machinery, not for increasing capacity.    Although the major aim of many companies is to boost efficiency, a number of concerns are willing to tackle capacity-increasing projects if they see growing demand. B.F. Goodrich Co., Akron, Ohio, expects capital outlays next year to rise from this year's $200 million level, and is concentrating mainly on cutting costs. But it does plan to build a $13 million second hangar at Everett, Wash., for a recently purchased aircraft-services unit. &quot;There's a real shortage of capacity for aircraft service,&quot; said Chairman John D. Ong.    As companies put together their spending programs, few are paying much attention to the presidential election. The result may or may not affect the economy, but Edward Blood, vice president of strategic planning and analysis at General Mills Inc., says it really doesn't matter.    &quot;The nature of our business is not specific to the economy,&quot; says Mr. Blood. &quot;We're not as sensitive to the gross national product as General Motors. I think people will eat Wheaties, Cheerios or Crispy Wheat and Raisins whether or not there's a Republican in office.&quot; The Minneapolis processed-foods and restaurant concern plans to spend $420 million in 1989, up $10 million from 1988, with $110 million going for a cereal plant at Covington, Ga.    Grumman Corp., the Bethpage, N.Y., aerospace company, is highly dependent on defense contracts, yet its officials don't think it makes much difference who wins the election. The Grumman executives say whoever wins will be under pressure to cut defense costs. So Grumman, even though it has a sizable order backlog, is cutting capital outlays.    J. Clayton Stephenson, vice chairman and chief financial officer for Union Carbide Corp., Danbury, Conn., says the election won't affect the company's spending plans because &quot;we can't turn around on a dime.&quot; In any case, even if a recession does occur, Mr. Stephenson expects chemical supplies to remain tight into the 1990s. As a result, Carbide expects to raise outlays about 7% to around $800 million. This year, however, the company has raised spending 25%.    It is true that capital spending is a lagging indicator, declining only after a general business downturn is under way. But companies usually manage to adjust fairly quickly, canceling some projects and postponing others.    Obviously, the size of the capital-spending cut depends on the severity of the recession. The biggest spending slashes in the post-World War II period came in the 1957-58, 1973-75 and 1981-82 recessions, by far the worst of the postwar slumps. So capital spending -- currently supporting the expansion -- can be expected to turn around and make the next downturn worse.    ---    Planned Spending on New Plants and Equipment in 1988      Percent gain from year earlier, in 1982 dollars                  November 1987   7.3%                  March 1988      8.0%                  May 1988       11.9%                  August 1988    11.6%0   Source: Survey by Commerce Department.</TEXT></DOC>
