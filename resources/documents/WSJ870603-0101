H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co., the Los Angeles-based parent of the nation's second-largest thrift, yesterday said it plans to write off its $24 million investment in the secondary reserve fund in the second quarter. And Financial Corp. of America, the biggest thrift concern, said it would follow suit with its $23 million investment.    But Great Western Financial Corp., parent of the nation's third-largest thrift, said it won't write off its $49.1 million investment in the secondary reserve.    Edwin Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, testified on May 14 before a congressional committee that the secondary reserve had been wiped out, because the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, determined that the FSLIC was insolvent by $6.3 billion as of the end of last year. The Bank Board, which regulates thrifts, also sent a letter to thrifts directing them to write off their investments in the secondary reserve during the month of May.    Most of the nation's 3,200 thrifts, which have smaller amounts invested in the FSLIC secondary reserve, are expected to take such write-offs in the current quarter.    Richard H. Deihl, chairman of Ahmanson, said in an interview that the write-off was caused by the recent directives from the Bank Board and a decision by the Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting rules for publicly held companies.    Mr. Deihl, in the interview, said Ahmanson's second-quarter earnings will be about $40 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with $76.6 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. The drop in earnings will be caused by the secondary reserve write-off and a decision to delay sales of as much as $1 billion of loans and mortgage-backed securities, he said.    The FSLIC write-off will reduce Ahmanson's earnings about 13 cents a share, and the delayed sales will push about 30 cents a share of profit into later quarters, Mr. Deihl said. Because of rising interest rates, the prices that investors are willing to pay for securities backed by Ahmanson's adjustable-rate mortgages have fallen temporarily, he said.    But Ian Campbell, a senior vice president of Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Great Western, said, &quot;Our intention remains to vigorously oppose any move that would require a write-off.&quot; He added, &quot;We're trying to communicate that to a variety of people, including those who are involved in the emerging issues task force. We still think it's an obligation of the federal government.&quot;    Great Western has by far the largest investment in the FSLIC secondary reserve of any company. Still, with shareholders' equity of $1.67 billion and earnings of $70 million to $80 million in recent quarters, even an after-tax write-off of about $25 million wouldn't damage the company's financial position.    But thrift-industry executives say that Great Western's refusal to write off the secondary reserve stems at least partly from the anger that James F. Montgomery, chairman of Great Western, feels toward Mr. Gray.    Mr. Montgomery wasn't available for comment.    Many thrift executives were outraged at Mr. Gray's action on the secondary reserve, and believe that he is trying to increase the pressure on Congress to enact a bill to recapitalize the FSLIC before his term ends on June 30. The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the major thrift trade group, has said it is preparing to file a lawsuit against the Bank Board, contending that it didn't follow due process of law before wiping out the FSLIC debt to thrifts.    In addition, the U.S. League, and the Bank Board, want Congress to include language that would reestablish the secondary reserve in the bill to allow FSLIC to borrow more money to replenish its capital.    However, Great Western could run into trouble with the FASB and the Securities and Exchange Commission, because those bodies are convinced that the FSLIC secondary reserve is gone.    Clarence Sampson, the SEC's chief accountant, attended the meeting of the FASB's emerging issues task force on May 21 and concurred in the decision that the secondary reserve should be written off.    &quot;As of this particular point in time, the FSLIC doesn't seem to have enough money to pay that off anyway, and contingencies such as pending legislation or lawsuits really wouldn't seem to have much impact on that,&quot; Mr. Sampson said in an interview yesterday.    The FSLIC secondary reserve was established in the 1960s with a special assessment on thrifts. Those funds have been accruing interest ever since, but the interest hasn't been paid out. For example, only about $6 million of Ahmanson's $24 million investment in the secondary reserve represents principal. The rest is accrued interest.    Other major thrift companies, whose operations were smaller in the 1960s, will have smaller write-offs. They include:    --CalFed Inc., Los Angeles, which will write off $16.1 million, or about 31 cents a share after taxes, in the second quarter.    --GlenFed Inc., Glendale, Calif., which will write off $8.9 million, or 27 cents a share after taxes, in its fourth quarter ending June 30.    --Golden West Financial Corp., Oakland, Calif., which will write off $7.8 million, or 15 cents a share after taxes, in the second quarter.    The Bank Board has said that four small thrifts, which it hasn't identified, will become technically insolvent after writing off their portion of the secondary reserve. Another 24 thrifts will reduce their capital below the required level of 3% of liabilities as a result of the write-offs, the Bank Board said. </TEXT></DOC>
