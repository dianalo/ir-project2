Police Commissioner Willie Williams called the indictmentsannounced Tuesday at a news conference ``another sad day'' for thePolice Department.   Since 1976, some 40 Philadelphia police officers have beenconvicted, mostly for protecting illegal gambling.   In addition, four judges have been found guilty of extortion,convicted of taking cash from a Roofers Union local whose 13 topofficials dispensed bribes to them and at least 10 other jurists,also removed from the bench.   FBI agents Tuesday said six narcotics officers were part of aracketeering conspiracy that involved extortion of money and drugs.A seventh narcotics officer and two civilians were charged withlesser drug and tax violations.   Some of the officers were accused of dealing cocaine andmethamphetamine seized from drug suspects.   ``For a police officer to use his or her position to steal moneyis bad enough, but for police officers to take money or otherproperty in exchange for allowing drug dealers to continue to dealdrugs or for the officers to take and to distribute drugsthemselves, that makes other forms of official corruption pale incomparison,'' said acting U.S. Attorney Thomas Lee II.   Six of the officers named are no longer members ofPhiladelphia's 7,000-member department. Williams said the seventhofficer was suspended and will be dismissed.   One indicted officer, former Lt. John Wilson, appeared suddenlyat the news conference to protest his innocence before the TVcameras. He was roughly evicted.   Outside, Wilson and former squad member James Cattalo, alsoindicted, criticized the charges. ``They are false, they areexaggerated,'' Cattalo said. ``No money was stolen. No drugs werestolen. Everything was done properly.''   The indictment alleges the scheme occurred from 1980 to 1984 andinvolved members of the department's elite Five Squad. The squadhas been disbanded.</TEXT></DOC>
