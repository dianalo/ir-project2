By last December, the Chicago-based company had delivered about3,100 Bradleys at a cost of $10 billion. Critics of the vehicle,most of which have been stationed in Europe, say it doesn't workand is unsafe.   A report aired on ABC World News Tonight said the network hasobtained documents from the company showing that there wereproblems with billing for certain parts on the Bradley.   ``Sometimes the FMC simply didn't tell the Army what the priceswere. Other times the prices billed were too high,'' ABC reported.   A man who worked for the government and was assigned by the Armyto audit the cost of Bradley parts told ABC, ``There's been timesthat I have caught some excessive prices, quite a few excessiveprices. But there's a lot of things I couldn't do anything aboutit.''   A woman who was in charge of parts billing for the Bradley toldABC that FMC executives often ordered her to inflate the price of apart.   ``Sometimes I would take it to an engineer and he would say `Oh,just fix this price.' I would go to another manager, `Oh, add 50percent, give us this price,''' said the woman, who requestedanonymity.   She sometimes was told to raise the price as much as 100percent, she said. ``It was my job. I had to do it.''   An engineer at FMC told ABC the company overbilled the Army fromthe beginning, sometimes tripling the price of parts.   When production of the Bradley began in 1980, the estimated costof each vehicle was $548,000, according to a document issued by thedeputy chief of staff for the Army. In 1984 the cost per Bradleywas frozen by contract at $1.2 million, where it remains today.   ABC News said FMC declined to discuss on camera their pricingprocedures for the Bradley. But, the company did provide writtenanswers to questions submitted over the phone, the network said.   The company stated that ``appropriate markups are added toparts,'' and that it does ``not condone and would not tolerateillegal activities or actions violating fair business practices.''   In July, the company announced that the Army had awarded it a$289 million contract for continued production of the Bradley atthe company's plant in Santa Clara, Calif.   Congressional, Army and FMC records show numerous mechanical andelectrical components on the vehicle have failed repeatedly inrecent years. Last December, Pentagon officials told Congress theyplanned to thicken the armor on the vehicle to make it 50 percent``more survivable'' in battle.</TEXT></DOC>
