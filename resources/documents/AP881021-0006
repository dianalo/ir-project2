(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The war of words to make English theofficial language in three states won't be settled until ElectionDay, but it has already prompted lawsuits and the resignations ofkey proponents, including Walter Cronkite.   Arizona and Colorado voters will get to decide the issue Nov. 8.It's also on the ballot in Florida but a lawsuit seeks to remove itbecause petitions in the citizens' initiative weren't circulated inSpanish in six of the state's 67 counties; a federal judge in Miamihas yet to rule on the suit.   Fourteen states have passed laws designating English theirofficial language. Only California has a constitutional amendment,approved in 1986. Arizona, Florida and Colorado also areconsidering amendments, which would, if approved, be harder tochange or repeal than a law.   Colorado's proposed Amendment 1 would ``declare that the Englishlanguage is the official language of the state of Colorado.''   Arizona's Proposition 106 would require state and countygovernments to conduct all business in English, with certainexceptions in the areas of education, public health and safety, thejustice system and federal election law.   Florida's Amendment 11 would designate English the state'sofficial language and give the Legislature authority to pass lawsenforcing that status.   Both sides say the stakes are especially high in Florida.   ``We want to turn the heat on this one and try to slow itdown,'' said Jeff Browne, statewide coordinator of Speak Up Now ForFlorida, which opposes the amendment. ``If it passes in Florida, Ithink it makes Texas, which is the next target state, more likelyto pass this type of law.''   Browne contends that English is already the de facto officiallanguage of both Florida and the country and that the proposedamendment could threaten fundamental liberties.   ``The framers of the (U.S.) Constitution had the opportunity todeclare an official language,'' Brown said. ``They chose not to.They felt this was an area the government ought to stay out of. In200 years, they were proved right.''   Pat Fulton, a spokeswoman for Florida English, which supportsthe amendment, agrees that Florida ``has become a bellwetherstate.''   Browne said he thinks Colorado and Arizona voters will pass themeasures, and conceded it will be hard to stop the Floridaamendment if it survives the court challenge.   But both sides of the official English battle have sufferedsetbacks this month.   On Oct. 12, a federal appeals court cleared the way for theColorado measure to appear on November ballots, ruling against alawsuit which argued that the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965required election material to be provided in Spanish in certainareas of the state.   The pending Florida suit, filed on behalf of four Dade CountySpanish-speaking residents, makes a similar argument.   In an action growing out of the campaigns, former CBS anchormanCronkite resigned on Oct. 13 from the advisory board of U.S.English, a group founded in 1983 by John Tanton and former Sen.S.I. Hayakawa of California to promote a U.S. constitutionalamendment.   Cronkite said he believed the Arizona proposal could hurtminorities, though he said he remains opposed to bilingualism.   On Monday, Linda Chavez, a former White House aide during theReagan administration, resigned as president of U.S. English,citing a report that at least one major contributor to the grouphas advocated forced sterilization. She did not elaborate.   That same day, U.S. English co-founder Tanton resigned. BothCronkite and Ms. Chavez had expressed concern over a 1986 memoTanton wrote suggesting that too many recent immigrants have beenRoman Catholics and that Hispanics bring with them a trend towardcorruption.   Ms. Chavez, who said she still supported the idea behind U.S.English, told Tallahassee business leaders last month that there isa difference in what's being expected of new immigrants.   ``Only in the last 20 years or so have we seen a dramatic shiftin terms of the attitude about that integration,'' she said, citingthe expansion of bilingual education from a $7.5 million program in1968 to $750 million now.</TEXT></DOC>
