Bass Group, as expected, withdrew its $75-a-share, $2 billion offer for Macmillan Inc. because of a significantly higher offer from Maxwell Communication Corp.    The investor group, which began the bidding for the publishing and information services group in May, said Maxwell's offer of about $87 a share, including a planned Macmillan dividend, was &quot;a full and fair price.&quot;    The Bass group began its effort to acquire New York-based Macmillan in May amid concern that Macmillan management might issue a newly approved preferred issue that would reduce the value of the group's investment. The Bass group owns about 2.4 million Macmillan shares, or 9.2% of those outstanding, which it purchased for roughly $145 million last year.    After the group offered to buy Macmillan for $64 a share in a friendly transaction, Macmillan's management proposed a $64.15-a-share restructuring. The group found that plan so offensive that it launched its first hostile tender offer.    It's understood that the Bass group spent $15 million to $20 million to fight Macmillan's restructuring in court and to make the tender offer. But the effort is expected to pay off handsomely, as Maxwell's offer is more than $20 a share, or about $600 million, above Macmillan management's proposed plan.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Macmillan shares closed at $86.50, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
