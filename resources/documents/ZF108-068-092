 If the time saved by automation exceeds the cost ofacquiring the equipment, a purchase is indicated.andP;  The softwarerequirements analysis should include features, performance,user-friendliness and interaction with other programs.andP;  Thehardware system can include base computer, memory, video cards,monitor, disk drives, mouse, printer, maintenance and training.andO;Cost analysis will construct a list of cost categories andquantify them as accurately as possible.andP;  A laptop computer willonly be indicated in those cases where mobility is a primeconsideration, particularly where there is a large data base to betransported and where complicated calculations are involved.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Hardware SelectionEquipment AcquisitionLaptop ComputersMicrocomputersUser NeedsSoftware SelectionCost Benefit Analysis.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Of computers, laptops and money: the purchasing decisionandM;The decision whether to buy a computer system is often easier when one isconsidering a laptop.andP;  Decisions are made after evaluating the pros and consof the alternatives.andP;  The plus side of purchasing a (desktop) computer is theresulting gain in productivity and efficiency.andP;  (Productivity is the state ofdoing more work in the same time, while efficiency is the degree of doing thesame work in less time.)andM;The minus side is the total price of the system, including the cost of thesoftware, training and maintenance.andP;  The purchase is justified by comparingthese dark and bright sides on the same basis: money.andM;The evaluation process first involves determining the tasks to be automated.andO;The estimated difference in time between manual and automated performance ofthese tasks is the gain in efficiency.andP;  Usually, a good measure for themonetary value of this benefit is the total salary cost of the employeesdoing the work.andM;The next step is selecting the software requirements.andP;  These are thefunctionality needs (features, performance, interaction with other packages,etc.) and the user-friendliness (ease of use, user-interface, documentation,support, etc.).andP;  The search can then begin for the cheapest softwarepackage(s) fitting the bill.andP;  Why pay more?.andM;If the requirements did not specify the operating system, as they could forconnectivity reasons, then the choice is made for you at this point.andM;The requisites to run the system and application software will putconstraints on the power and peripherals needed for the computer.andP;  The systemto be evaluated has to meet these needs and provide enough power or upgradepaths for the projected future uses.andP;  The outlined analysis obviouslyincludes a few tricky evaluations.andP;  The decision-maker must undergo thisprocess whether choosing a desktop or a laptop as a primary system.andP;  Theextra cost of portability can rarely be justified unless the job requirementsmake it necessary.andM;This can be the case with door-to-door salespeople and travellers needingcomputing power.andP;  Two common needs are a vast amount of data to betransported (e.g.andP;  a large inventory) or complicated calculations to beperformed (e.g.andP;  complex financial projections).andP;  As there is little choice,the monetary part of this analysis can almost be skipped.andP;  Money's sole rolein the decision-making process will concern the inclusion of the optionalfeatures (the ones not really necessary, but useful to have.)andM;The only headache involved will be determining the power and features needed.andO;Not really, but an important spin-off of the feasibility or cost-benefitanalysis is that you end up setting measurable objectives.andP;  This alone makesthe effort worth pursuing.andM;Accuracy is importantandM;Evaluating the total cost of a purchase is done by drafting a budget.andP;  Thisis a dual process.andP;  First, one has to come up with an exhaustive list of costcategories.andP;  Then, each item has to be quantified as accurately as possible.andM;Very often, the former is the more difficult.andP;  When considering computerhardware, items you might need to include in your shopping list are: basecomputer, additional memory, video card, monitor, hard disk and/or floppydisk drive and blank floppy disks, mouse, printer, paper and other supplies,network adapter card, additional external storage, maintenance, software,application software, utilities and training.andP;  A laptop requires specialthought concerning connectivity and data exchange, expansion possibilities,data security and backup.andM;Is the decision still too easy?andP;  Try considering it in the light of thefourth dimension: time.andP;  Maybe trying to figure out the economic life cycleof the computer system will make matters more complicated.andP;  Of course, if thematter is too mind-boggling, getting advice from a more experienced colleagueor from a computer professional should help solve the problem.andM;The author is the president of Boutquin Computer Consulting, based in SaintJohn, N.B.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
