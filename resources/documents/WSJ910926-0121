Mr. Anders, who took the helm at the nation's No. 2defense contractor in January, said a series of steps thisyear to reduce the size of the company, cut payroll andincrease productivity has begun to improve earnings and cashflow more rapidly than expected. Some of these funds, alongwith cash generated in the next few years, will be returnedto shareholders, the executive said.   &quot;At present, we have not decided upon what methods wemight employ to do so. We are, however, examining a number ofoptions. These include stock buy-back, increased dividend,special distribution or self tender,&quot; Mr. Anders said. Afterthe meeting, James J. Cunnane, chief financial officer, saidthere isn't any timetable for deciding about or acting onthese ideas.   Shareholders reacted favorably to the generally upbeatmessage. General Dynamics stock closed yesterday at $49.50,up $3.875 in late New York Stock Exchange trading.   On Tuesday, the shares spurted $3.875, to close at $45.625after one analyst raised her earnings estimate and anothersuggested that a share buy-back might be in the offing.   The sharp stock jumps raise the possibility that Mr.Anders and 24 other General Dynamics executives could qualifysoon for a bonus equal to two times their base pay underterms of a controversial compensation plan tied to the stockprice. A General Dynamics spokesman didn't dispute thatinterpretation of the plan.   In May, Mr. Anders, whose base pay is $800,000, and theother executives, received &quot;gain-sharing&quot; bonuses equal totheir base salaries when the company's stock price for the10th consecutive day hit at least $10 above the $25.5625level that it stood at when the plan was adopted in February.For each subsequent $10 jump in the share price, maintainedfor 10 days, the executives get additional bonuses equal totwice their base salaries.   Mr. Anders's remarks were in line with the new course hecharted for General Dynamics earlier this year. Responding tothe possibly permanent shrinkage of the defense budget, hehas pledged to reshape the company into a smaller, moreprofitable enterprise. He has said the company might moveinto new commercial markets.   At the meeting, he said General Dynamics expects to have acash balance &quot;in the $500 million to $600 million range&quot; bythe end of the year. That includes about $175 million inanticipated proceeds from the planned sale of the company'sdata processing business to Computer Sciences Corp., ElSegundo, Calif., announced earlier this week.   Some of those funds will be used to bolster balance sheetliquidity and to pay down some debt, Mr. Anders said. IfGeneral Dynamics loses a dispute with the U.S. over thecanceled A-12 attack plane program, the company will have topay as much as $650 million, Mr. Cunnane said. GeneralDynamics, which last year took charges of $1.3 billionrelated to the program, has said it is confident that it willwin the case.   Mr. Anders also said General Dynamics may makeacquisitions in or related to the company's core businesses.&quot;We have no plans for additional investments now,&quot; Mr.Cunnane said. If that changes, he said, it might reduce theamount available to be returned to shareholders.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          GENERAL DYNAMICS Corp. said any future acquisitions wouldbe in its core defense businesses and that it isn't anylonger considering expansion into new commercial markets.Also, the company's third-quarter per-share net income lastyear was $1.63. An earlier edition misstated the acquisitionplans and income.   (WSJ Sept. 27, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
