Barbara Raboy, the bank's director, apologizes for the clutter and the worn carpet, explaining that the bank is nonprofit and subsists on sliding fees pegged to a client's income. The average total cost of a conception ranges from $400 to $1,600, including consultation fees and the typical four- to six-month course of insemination, using two units of sperm -- at $60 apiece -- each month.    The bank offers fertility counseling, sperm banking and private sperm storage, and insemination on the premises. One-third of its female clients are wives of infertile or low-fertility husbands; one-third are single professional women, and one-third are lesbians. In fact, the first clients on a recent morning are a female couple ushered in for their insemination counseling. &quot;Who are we to judge who's fit to parent?&quot; Ms. Raboy says. &quot;We base it on medical and not social factors.&quot;    &quot;The most intense women to work with,&quot; she continues, &quot;are single straight women getting on in age and very much involved in their careers. They're well-off, concerned about their fertility and very much want a kid. They bring a sense of urgency. Our oldest client who's gotten pregnant is 44.&quot;    Sperm donors are required to come in at least four times to complete questionnaires and provide semen samples, as well as to undergo interviews, physical examinations and a battery of blood tests and disease cultures. During this process, their semen is quarantined for three months while the tests are repeated.    In its early days, the bank provoked a major controversy over AIDS risk by accepting gay donors, though there were never any cases of infection. Now, although there is no formal policy against it, the bank has no gay donors. Besides testing for AIDS, the bank uses detailed questionnaires to measure compliance with safe-sex practices. Ms. Raboy notes, too, that her clients have become more informed on such issues as quarantine periods and diagnostic techniques.    Ms. Raboy shows a visitor into the sperm-storage area, where seven 44-liter tanks are housed, each holding up to 1,200 semen samples. Each sample contains 20 million to 60 million sperm, supercooled in liquid nitrogen to a state of suspended animation at minus 196 degrees Celsius. When thawed, about half of the sperm in each sample will survive.    Their anonymous sources are listed in a catalog: Donor number 092, for example, is a 5-foot, 10-inch Hispanic man of Mexican descent with brown eyes and black hair. Number 268 is a 6-foot, 1-inch Caucasian man of Scots-Irish-German descent with blond hair and blue eyes. More detailed files list particulars about their educational and medical histories.    Clients can either order the semen through their own doctor (the bank cold-ships nationwide) or come in for prenatal exams and insemination at the center.    Contrary to public misconception, Ms. Raboy says, &quot;most of our sperm inventory is dedicated to private sperm storage.&quot; One recent request came from a 50-year-old man with a young woman friend. Another came from the father of a teenager suffering from Hodgkin's disease; the boy was facing radiotherapy, which would leave him sterile. Ms. Raboy notes that storage by men facing cancer therapy or vasectomy is increasingly common at sperm banks nationwide.    The phone rings with a call from a client. &quot;You're pregnant?&quot; Ms. Raboy says to the caller, a married woman who has just conceived her second child through the bank. &quot;Oh, this is so emotional,&quot; Ms. Raboy exclaims. &quot;This makes our day.&quot; After hanging up, she spreads the news to her colleagues. &quot;Who froze this one?&quot; she asks. &quot;I'll have to let them know. It's just like being a grandparent!&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
