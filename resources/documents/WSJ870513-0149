He's the leader-elect of West Germany's biggest party, the Social Democrats, and he's standing before a downtown hall full of workers in a city that's long been a SPD stronghold. Down the street, monuments to the German welfare state -- the health office, the employment office and the union -- stand in a line. Known as &quot;the socialist mile,&quot; the area is so much SPD territory that other parties don't even advertise here.    Yet as this city-state prepares to elect a new government Sunday, SPD leaders such as Mr. Vogel have cause to be nervous. The SPD is weaker today than it's ever been in the nearly 40 years since the Federal Republic was founded. On a national level, the SPD locked itself out of power for four more years when it lost its bid in January to knock out the governing coalition in Bonn of conservatives and their junior partners, the liberal Free Democrats. Only four of Germany's 11 states remain in SPD control, and this year two SPD states face elections that stand good chances of weakening SPD power.    The slide of the wide, left-leaning party signals a change in German society, and, to some extent, in the rest of Northern Europe. The SPD is a workers' party, and as such has been a big power in one of the world's three mightiest industrialized nations. But the blue-collar component of German society is thinning: In 1985 these workers were 40% of the working population, eight percentage points fewer than white-collar workers and down from 51% in 1950. Much of the growing white-collar segment that had originally supported the SPD is moving to the ecological movement, the Green Party. Like Labor in Britain, which probably will be defeated in a national election next month, the SPD is losing votes to a new party. In both nations the new demography is causing a political rearrangement unprecedented in this generation's Europe.    &quot;German parties are splintering,&quot; says Hans-Joachim Veen of the conservative Konrad Adenauer Foundation. &quot;As the SPD loses to the Greens, it loses its mandate as a broad-based national party.&quot;    The SPD's problem with workers is visible as Mr. Vogel addresses the meeting here in Hamburg. &quot;We will fight to keep this republic from becoming more black,&quot; he says, referring to the party color of the conservative Christian Democrats. His audience, longshoremen and union organizers, applauds. The workers call Mr. Vogel &quot;comrade&quot; and address him with the familiar &quot;du&quot; that's part of SPD tradition. But party divisions come to the surface.    &quot;Today everything {in the SPD} is done by the intellectuals and academics,&quot; charges a man in a peach-colored shirt. &quot;What about the workers?&quot;    On Sunday, the SPD will face the results of this disillusionment. It's not likely to regain the absolute majority it needs to rule alone. A massive scandal bringing down German unions' housing concern, Neue Heimat, has hurt the party, which has close union links. Hamburg would seem a likely candidate for a &quot;Red-Green&quot; coalition between the SPD and Greens, for the local Green Party polled 10.4% in this election's first round. But it's a telling sign of SPD frailty that, even in final pre-election days, the local Greens reject a partnership and seem to be calling the shots. In Hamburg the SPD's biggest hope is a coalition with the Free Democrats, the slender liberal party currently in coalition at the national level with the CDU. This scenario means the CDU stands its best chance in decades of winning Hamburg.    Hamburg's mayor, Klaus von Dohnanyi, is in some ways an emblem of the SPD's quandary. The son of a lawyer killed by the Nazis for his part in the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, the mayor studied law at U.S. Ivy League universities. He typifies the moderate, educated elite that has traditionally played a big role in leading the postwar SPD. Like Helmut Schmidt, the most prominent of this group, Mr. von Dohnanyi has governed with an articulate style that long made him popular. And like Mr. Schmidt, who was routed from the chancellor's office after a vote of no-confidence five years ago, Mr. von Dohnanyi is becoming the victim of the strengthening left wing in the SPD.    The CDU for its part isn't offering an entirely attractive alternative. Instead of focusing on changes it would make, the party has worked on trying to scare voters to its side with the prospect of a Red-Green coalition. Conservative mayoral candidate Hartmut Perschau charges SPD infighting makes the party incapable of forming a government. SPD leaders, he's said, &quot;wrap around each other like eels.&quot; When it comes to addressing Hamburg's finances, though, the CDU prescribes a traditional philosophy that's not necessarily growth oriented: &quot;thrift.&quot;    At a national level, the CDU has found this play-it-safe technique works -- at least for now. Together with its Bavarian sister, the Christian Social Union, the CDU polled 44.3%, down from the 48.8% of four years ago, but so much ahead of the SPD's 37% that the governing coalition returned to power. Chancellor-candidate Johannes Rau, who refused to campaign with the Greens, cost such losses that an SPD leader more friendly to the radicals, Oskar Lafontaine, has become the likely next candidate for chancellorship.    Even &quot;Ostpolitik,&quot; the policy of working toward openings with the East bloc that buoyed the SPD in the 1960s and 1970s, is no longer bringing in votes. In recent years the party worked hard to remind voters that it initiated the policy, even negotiating a &quot;draft treaty&quot; on chemical weapons with the ruling Communist Party in East Berlin. But Hans-Dietrich Genscher, foreign minister and leader of the Free Democrats, has more or less co-opted the detentist role for his party. In the debate over the zero-zero option currently burning in Germany, the SPD was slow to put forward a proposal. The terms are set by Free Democrats and the CDU.    The Greens have been the main benefactors of the SPD's slip. Bearded academics and white-collar workers who once would have graced SPD gatherings were present en masse at a recent Green Party gathering in industrial Duisburg. The Greens, who with 8.3% of the vote grew fastest in the last election, are steering leftward. At Duisburg, the left wing of the anti-NATO, anti-nuclear party seized control from more-moderate Greens. The electoral consequences of this swing are usually at SPD expense.    For all Germans, the SPD's wobbliness causes concern. &quot;When one party stops being a broad-based national party, it's hard for the other big parties,&quot; says Mr. Veen of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. &quot;The SPD's weakness takes pressure off conservatives to be a wide national party.&quot;    Germany isn't the only nation witnessing such a confusion on the left. In Britain, the weakness of Labor and anti-NATO policies of Neil Kinnock are helping the Alliance, a partnership of the Liberal Party and the newer Social Democrats. The split could help Margaret Thatcher in June.    In Hamburg, the SPD is trying to gain last-minute votes. But Hamburgers -- from sailors to leather-draped yuppies -- are wondering about their old party. Their confusion keeps showing up at the meeting with Mr. Vogel. Asks a voter: &quot;How many parties are there in the SPD?&quot;    ---   Miss Shlaes is editorial-features editor of The Wall Street Journal/Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
