Sadler, General Attorney,Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611, (312)751-4513 (FTS 386-4513).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The purpose of this rule is to provideguidelines for the administration of the Board's authority under 5 U.S.C.5514 for recovering debts owed to the United States by installment collectionsfrom the current pay accounts of its employees.The Debt Collection Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97-365, amended section 5514 topermit interagency recovery of general debts due the United States. However,before agencies may use this new recovery procedure, certain due processrights must be extended to the debtor. The specific procedures in thisregulation conform with the statutory provisions added to 5 U.S.C. 5514by the Debt Collection Act, 5 CFR 550.1101 <T3>et seq.</T3>, and court decisions emphasizing the debtor's right todue process protection prior to the initiation of an action to recoverfor a debt (<T3>Califano </T3>v. <T3>Yamasaki</T3>, 442 U.S. 682 (1979)).On March 9, 1984, the U.S. General Accounting Office and the Departmentof Justice adopted final regulations amending the Federal Claims CollectionStandards (FCCS). See 4 CFR Chapter II. Although the installment collectionfrom the current pay account of an employee described in these regulationsis authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5514, such a collection is still an administrativeoffset as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1). Consequently, any collectionmatters involving salary offset not addressed in these regulations aregoverned by the FCCS.In essence this rule provides that the Board shall not deduct moneys fromthe current pay of one of its employees in order to satisfy a debt owedby that employee to the United States until it has afforded the employeea pre-offset hearing before an impartial adjudicator. However, there arethree types of collections against pay which are not subject to the fullprocedural rights provided by these regulations.The first is a collection which has resulted from an overpayment causedby an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federalbenefit program. An employee who makes such an election is aware, or reasonablyshould be aware, that the election would cause a change in the amount withheldfrom his or her salary. Accordingly, it is appropriate to exclude fromthe scope of the salary offset due process procedures routine ``catch-up''retroactive collections which are necessary solely because of brief, necessary,and inevitable processing delays.A similar situation exists with regard to ministerial adjustments of payrates of allowances, <T3>e.g.</T3>, credit union allotment, union dues deduction, etc., whichcannot be placed into effect immediately because of normal processing delays.The debt in this case does not arise from any error committed by eitherthe employee or the agency. The validity of the obligation is beyond reasonabledispute and the amount due is readily ascertainable.For these two types of collections the rule provides for a limited procedurewhereby the employee is notified in advance of the amount of the retroactivecollection and may dispute the retroactive collection by notifying a specifiedofficial. Furthermore, it should be noted that in collections by salaryoffset made for reasons other than normal processing delays or, even ifmade by reason of normal processing delays but where the period for whichretroactive deduction must be made will exceed four pay period, the fulldue process procedures set out in the final regulations shall apply.Finally, where there is no question regarding credibility and veracity,no pre-offset hearing will be granted. In these cases the Board will makeits pre-offset determination under this part based upon a review of thewritten record. Such a provision in the regulation is consistent with theFCCS (4 CFR 102.3(c)).In addition, this rule also covers the situation in which the Board isnot the creditor agency but merely the paying agency of the debtor. Insuch situations, the rule provides that this agency will commence deductionsfrom the current pay account of an employee upon receipt of a properlycertified debt claim as provided by 5 CFR 550.1108.On January 5, 1988, the Board published this rule as a proposed rule andinvited comments for 120 days ending May 4, 1988, (53 FR 143-147). No commentswere received within the allotted time frame. The Board did receive onMay 5, 1988, a comment from the American Federation of Government Employees(AFGE), Local 375. AFGE suggested that the Board provide some limited dueprocess when it is the paying agency (see andSection; 361.17), and receivesa claim from another agency. Specifically, AFGE recommends that when theBoard receives such a claim and the affected employee disputes the debt,the Board should provide the documentation from the requesting agency whichproves that the debt exists and give the employee 60 days to attempt resolutionof the debt before offset would occur.Under 5 CFR 550.1108(b)(3), if a paying agency receives a debt claim whichmeets the requirements of that section, it is not authorized to reviewthe merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the validityof the debt. Under 5 CFR 550.1108(b), upon receipt of a properly certifieddebt claim the paying agency should schedule deductions to begin prospectivelyat the next officially established pay interval.Section 361.17 of this part provides that if the Board receives a claimwhich meets the requirements of 5 CFR 550.1108, deductions will commenceat the next established pay interval. In addition, the Board will notifythe employee of receipt of the claim, the amount of the debt, and the datesalary deductions will commence and the amount of the deductions. Furthermore,it is the agency's policy to permit the affected employee to view and makecopies of any documentation provided by the creditor agency.It is the Board's view that andSection; 361.17 fully complies with the requirementsof 5 CFR 550.1108 and therefore AFGE's suggestion was not adopted. This regulation has been approved by the Office of Personnel Management.This rule is not a major rule as defined under section 1(b) of ExecutiveOrder 12291 (46 FR 13193, 3 CFR 1981 Comp., p. 127) and, therefore, a regulatoryimpact analysis has not been prepared. In addition, any information requiredto be furnished under this rule is information to be provided by a governmentemployee or agency and, therefore, is not covered by the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 361</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Wages, DebtCollection.1.
