The SEC, in a complaint filed in federal district court here, charged that the retired banker, Russell S. Douglas of Brunswick, Maine, bought 2,000 shares of Coastal, on Oct. 15 and 16, 1985, about a week after being told by an executive of Norstar that the company would soon make a bid for Coastal. Norstar made the offer on Oct. 17, 1985, but Coastal rejected the $30-a-share bid.    Mr. Douglas settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt. As part of the settlement, he agreed to repay $9,500 representing potential profits and to pay a civil penalty of another $9,500. He also agreed to a court order barring him from future violations of federal securities laws.    The executive who told Mr. Douglas about the expected bid was Roger Castonguay, chief executive of Norstar Bank of Maine, a unit of Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar, according to a spokesman for the unit. Mr. Castonguay, who wasn't identified by name in the complaint, wasn't charged with any wrongdoing; the complaint said that the Norstar executive thought the information &quot;was for a legitimate corporate purpose and that Douglas would treat this information as confidential.&quot; Mr. Castonguay couldn't be reached, and the bank spokesman said, &quot;I don't think it's appropriate for us to comment&quot; about the SEC complaint.    Mr. Douglas didn't return a phone call seeking comment. Coastal was acquired earlier this year for about $40 a share in stock by Suffield Financial Corp., Suffield, Conn. </TEXT></DOC>
