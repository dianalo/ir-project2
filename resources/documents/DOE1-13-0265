<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-13-0265 </DOCNO><TEXT>A detailed hydrogeological evaluation was carried out in the Swan Hillsarea of north-central Alberta in a 15,760 km/sup 2/ region effectivelycentred on the special waste injection site of the Alberta Special WasteManagement Corporation. The study was based on the examination and interpretationof stratigraphic and hydrogeologic information from 3276 wells, 635 drillstemtests, 3477 core analyses and 645 formation water analyses, all of whichwere processed using software developed by the Basin Analysis Group ofthe Alberta Geological Survey. Based on a detailed analysis of the naturalflow system, using potentiometric surface maps, hydraulic head cross-sections,and pressure head versus depth plots, seven major aquifer units and sevenintervening aquitards (and minor aquicludes) were identified. The three-dimensionalnatural and perturbed flow regimes were simulated using a finite-elementnumerical model. Four of the major aquifer units were also studied usinga non-leaky analytical model and a leaky &quot;two-aquifer&quot; analytical model.</TEXT></DOC>
