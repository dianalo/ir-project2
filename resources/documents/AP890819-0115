LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fourteen rockets hit Kabul today,injuring 18 people on the 70th anniversary of the nation'sindependence from Britain.   Foreign Minister Mohammad Nabi Amani, who gave the casualtyfigure, said the 14 rockets struck mainly residential areas acrossthe city.   Saturday is normally the first day of the working week in MoslemAfghanistan, with bazaars bustling and thousands of people on thestreets of Kabul.   But because of the independence holiday and rumors thatU.S.-backed guerrillas fighting to overthrow the Soviet-supportedgovernment were planning massive rocket attacks on the city, streetswere almost empty.   The government did not mark the anniversary with a ceremony,despite reports that President Najib would appear at an officialfunction.   Kabul has been hit almost daily by rocket attacks since late Juneand the guerrillas have claimed responsibility for some attacks.   No one claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack.   The rebels say they aim for military targets, but unofficialestimates say 98 percent of the rockets have hit non-militarytargets including schools, homes, crowded bus stops and bazaars.   One rocket today went through the roof of the home of a family inKarte Parwann, just blocks from the British High Commission, whichwas closed before the Feb. 15 withdrawal of Soviet troops fromAfghanistan.   It went through two floors, landing in the living room andshowering shrapnel on a woman who suffered injuries to the back andright arm.   Young boys and girls wailed hysterically and the brother of theinjured woman said the United States was responsible for the deathsof innocent Afghans.   ``They're killing us. Why are they killing us?'' he asked,refusing to give his name.   U.N. sources say 335 people were killed and more than 900 injuredin rocket attacks and a car bombing between June 25 and Aug. 12.Virtually all were civilians.   The Afghan government on Thursday accused the United States ofsupplying the rebels with new, more deadly rockets that explode inthe air and shower small warheads over a wide area.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the rockets,which he did not identify, had U.S. markings.   A promised trip Friday to see pieces of the new missiles wascanceled. Deputy spokesman Naquib Sameer said the Kabul garrisoncommander had destroyed the pieces because they were too dangerous.   U.S. officials have promised new arms shipments to the mujahedeenbut have not revealed the types of weapons. Published reports saythey include cluster bombs and Spanish 120mm mortars to craterairport runways.   The government's commemoration of King Amanullah's treaty withBritain in 1919 giving Afghanistan its independence was almostnon-existent. Red, black and green Afghan flags hung limply onflagpoles in the afternoon heat and tanks were positioned at majorintersections for the first time in more than a month.   Afghanistan gained its independence at the end of the thirdAnglo-Afghan war, at a time when this rugged land-locked country wasa buffer between the two superpowers of the day, czarist Russia andEngland. Najib has compared the struggle in the nation's 11-year-oldcivil war with the fight by Amanullah to liberate the country.</TEXT></DOC>
