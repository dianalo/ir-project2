It alsosaid its chairman, maverick financier Werner K. Rey,resigned.   Mr. Rey, who is also Omni's majority owner, is succeededby board member Walter Koenig. Mr. Rey couldn't be reachedfor comment.</LP><TEXT>   Stock market traders reported a flood of small sell ordersin Omni shares after trading resumed. The shares had beensuspended since Thursday. Omni's bearer share closed at 260francs ($193.44), down from 640 francs last week on theZurich stock exchange. In early January, it was trading at1,090 francs.   &quot;This is a tragedy for the small investors,&quot; one tradersaid.   Mr. Rey's resignation represents a confusing managerialflip-flop. On Monday, the company announced that Mr. Rey hadquit as board managing director and that another manager,Jean-Claude Vagnieres, had assumed operational management.Then, on Tuesday, a company spokesman insisted Mr. Rey wouldcontinue as chairman and retain primary responsibility forthe company. But yesterday it said he has in fact quit.   Cash-strapped Omni, parent of a vast array of businessholdings, has received much criticism for itspublic-information practices. For instance, on Tuesday Omnisaid it was in talks with Lonrho PLC on the possibility ofthe British company taking a stake in Omni. But a Lonrhospokesman said flatly: &quot;We never discussed or said we wouldput any money into Omni directly.&quot;   And the company issued separate statements, one in Germanand one in English. The German version was couched inlanguage that differed in some respects from the Englishversion released later. While neither statement elaborated oncreditors, it is known that Omni and its banks held a meetingTuesday evening. At that meeting, people close to the talkssay, the banks made clear they weren't prepared to rescueOmni.   The German release spoke of a review of all of Omni'spending negotiations and transactions, given the currentsituation. The English version went further: &quot;All pendingnegotiations and transactions are halted in view of thepending moratorium.&quot;   That casts a shadow over plans for Omni to sell a 53%stake in the services group Adia S.A. for 770 million francsto German retailer Asko AG and Swiss investor Klaus Jacobs.Still, Adia expressed optimism that the sale will becompleted.   Lonrho has agreed to buy from Omni a 19.95% stake inHarpener AG, a German company in which Omni holds about 54%.</TEXT></DOC>
