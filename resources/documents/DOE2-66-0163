When used for the storage of gas, the pressure in the cavitymay be reduced to well below the geostatic pressure in the surroundingsalt. In these conditions the salt will creep and the shape and sizeof the cavity will change. The ability to predict these changes, andthe effect they may have on the subsurface system is necessary for theefficient operation of the storage. British Gas has developed a mathematicalmodel for investigating this mechanical behaviour of salt cavities. Itis based on an extensive programme of experimental work to determinethe rheological behaviour of the salt. This paper describes this modeland shows how it has been used to solve a number of typical problemsencountered in the planning and operation of salt cavities.</TEXT></DOC>
