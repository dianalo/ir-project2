Regan saidtoday.   ``The president was practically immobile during that period ofDecember 1986, January and February of '87, all because the firstlady was saying no, no, no he can't go out,'' Regan said onNBC-TV's ``Today'' program.   ``Now she used as an excuse the fact that he had a minoroperation right after the Christmas holidays. But I said, `No, thispresident is going to get shot down in flames. He's not out talkingto the people about Iran-Contra. He should be making his own case.'But he didn't.''   In his book, ``For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington,''which went on sale today, Regan said he believes the president'scontention that he knew nothing of the Iran-Contra affair, in whichproceeds from secret U.S. arms sales to Iran were diverted to theNicaraguan rebels, until told about it by Attorney General EdwinMeese III on Nov. 25, 1986.   ``The president ... is a ruddy man, with bright red cheeks. Heblanched when he heard Meese's words. The color drained from hisface, leaving his skin pasty white. ... Nobody who saw thepresident's reaction that afternoon could believe for a moment thathe knew about the diversion of funds before Meese told him aboutit. He was the picture of a man to whom the inconceivable hadhappened,'' Regan wrote.   He said that he urged the president to conteract the effects ofthe Iran-Contra affair by undertaking an active speaking scheduleoutside Washington, but was balked by astrological advice to thefirst lady that ``harm would come to Reagan if he went out of theWhite House.''   ``By humoring her, we had given her control,'' he said of Mrs.Reagan.   Regan, in his memoir, portrayed the president as a hesitant andunassertive chief executive controlled by a wife who relied heavilyupon the predictions of an astrologer.   Former press secretary Larry Speakes, who also wrote a ``kissand tell'' book about his years in the White House, said today hewas not aware of the first lady's reliance on astrology.   ``I didn't see it and had no evidence of it,'' Speakes said onCBS's ``This Morning'' show. ``I've got no reason to doubt. But Inever saw any crystal balls in the Cabinet Room. From time to time,strange people did come into the White House. But I didn't knowthat they were astrologers, if they were.''   The White House issued a brief statement about the book onSunday that said: ``Vindictiveness and revenge are not admirablequalities, and are not worthy of comment. Donald Regan's attemptsto defame the first lady, on Mother's Day no less, are certainly inthat category.''   Asked about the White House statement, Regan responded: ``Theyought to know it when they see it.''</TEXT></DOC>
