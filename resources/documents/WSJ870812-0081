YangStaff Reporters of the Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED) </IN><TEXT>   Some Texas savings and loans were hit with a series of withdrawals yesterday after the governor of Texas said the federal government won't fully back deposits.    Gov. William Clements was quoted in yesterday's editions of the Amarillo Daily News predicting that the ailing Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will wind up paying depositors at institutions that fail &quot;like 30 cents on the dollar and give them a piece of paper like a bond.&quot; The governor said federal efforts to keep insolvent thrifts open &quot;is an absolute fraud on the general public.&quot;    The governor's remarks stunned thrift industry executives and regulators in Texas and Washington. They also touched off &quot;higher than normal&quot; withdrawals at savings and loans mostly in the Amarillo area, according to Roy G. Green, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of Amarillo said about $35,000 was taken out of the institution yesterday because of the report of Gov. Clements's prediction. Most of it was deposited in the bank across the street, First Federal said.    William Zimmerman, First Federal's senior vice president and chief financial officer, said the thrift called a meeting of bank officials early in the day and monitored outflows hourly. He said that of the $35,000 withdrawn from the thrift, about $30,000 of it was one man's life's savings. &quot;He didn't care whether the article was factual or not, it was his life's savings,&quot; Mr. Zimmerman said.    The Amarillo incident comes as Texas savings and loan depositors are nervous about the safety of their money and the soundness of banks and thrifts in Texas. Texas leads the nation so far this year in bank failures and the number of insolvent thrifts. For the past several months, savings and loans have been scrambling unsuccessfully to head off a liquidity crisis. The strong reaction by thrift industry regulators reflects their concern that the slightest nudge could set Texas financial institutions reeling.    Mr. Green and regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas yesterday braced themselves for a run of withdrawals like that by arranging additional amounts of currency to be ready should customers threaten the liquidity of some institutions. Mr. Green and M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, held separate news conferences to refute Gov. Clements's comments.    &quot;The governor is wrong,&quot; Mr. Wall declared. Both he and Mr. Green said that &quot;the full faith and credit of the United States&quot; is behind federally insured deposits in thrifts and banks. Texas depositors should know, Mr. Wall said, that &quot;your deposits are safe -- fully safe -- to the limit of $100,000.&quot; Added Mr. Green, &quot;to state anything to the contrary, is fallacious and misleading.&quot;    Mr. Green added that there is some $130 billion of liquid assets available for the FSLIC and the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks to meet the demands of thrift customers. That figure includes about $4 billion that is available at the Dallas bank, he said.    In Austin, a spokesman for Gov. Clements said the remarks were accurately reported in the newspaper, though he said the headline was wrong. The front page banner headline said: &quot;Clements says FSLIC will go 'belly-up.'&quot;    In fact, Gov. Clements said: &quot;I will predict what is going to happen. The federal government is finally going to belly up to this problem and when they do, they're going to pay off those depositors like 30 cents on the dollar.&quot; He added, &quot;They're going to rationalize by saying, 'Well, I gave you 70 cents on the dollar on a piece of paper.'&quot;    &quot;There isn't, there never has, there never will be such a plan,&quot; Mr. Wall declared. &quot;There has never been a suggestion either here or in Congress of anything like that.&quot;    In a statement late yesterday, Gov. Clements didn't explain his views. He said the statements by thrift-industry regulators &quot;represent a reaffirmation by the federal government to stand behind the depositors of the savings and loan institutions across Texas. I applaud the renewed commitment.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
