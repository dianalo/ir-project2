Lange accused the French government of flouting internationallaw with the move.   The New Zealand prime minister said he was advised that Capt.Dominique Prieur was returning to Paris ``forthwith'' from Haoatoll.   Ms. Prieur and Maj. Alain Mafart, the other French agent, weresupposed to remain in exile on the South Pacific island until July1989 under an agreement worked out by the United Nations. Theaccord stipulated that they could not leave the island without theconsent of New Zealand.   Lange said he expected Ms. Prieur to arrive in Paris on Fridayor Saturday and that he intends to pursue the matter with Frenchauthorities.   ``There has been no confirmation of departure but it is notconsented to and should she leave it would be a clear breach ofFrance's obligation under international law,'' Lange said in astatement.   Ms. Prieur and Mafart were sent to New Zealand to stop theRainbow Warrior from leading a protest flotilla to Mururoa, a SouthPacific island where France conducts underground nuclear tests.   One crewman on the Rainbow Warrior was killed in the bombing inAuckland Harbor.   The pair, who worked for the French secret service, theDirection Generale de la Securite Exterieure, pleaded guilty in1985 to manslaughter.   Mafart was repatriated in December last year after complainingof a stomach disorder.   France's decision to end Ms. Prieur's exile on Hao atoll followsthe release of three French hostages from Lebanon and Thursday'sbloody rescue in New Caledonia of 23 hostages held by Melanesianseparatists.   All three events could boost the chances of conservativecandidate Prime Minister Jacques Chirac in the runoff in France'spresidential election Sunday. He is running against PresidentFrancois Mitterrand.   Mafart and Ms. Prieur originally were sentenced to 10 years injail. Their conviction sparked an unprecedented diplomatic rowbetween Paris and Wellington which ended after seven months, whenthe sentences were commuted under the agreement worked out byJavier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general.   Under the agreement the pair was released into French custody onHao, a tiny military outpost near Mururoa.   In return Paris apologized for the bombing, paid $7 millioncompensation and promised not to block New Zealand exports toEurope.</TEXT></DOC>
