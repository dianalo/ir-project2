The bank-holding company, which received $130 million in open-bank assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in 1986, said that it is taking &quot;more aggressive action&quot; in working out nonperforming loans and in marketing repossessed real estate.    As a result, the company expects to report that loan-loss reserves increased about $47 million for the third quarter, producing a loss for the period of $46 million to $49 million. A year earlier, BancOklahoma had a loss of $12.5 million.    Leonard J. Eaton, chairman and chief executive officer, said that about two-thirds of the company's nonperforming assets involve real estate, and that appraisals of those properties during the first six months of 1988 declined an average of 26% from prior periods. The company wrote down those properties, &quot;but the cost of carrying nonperforming real estate remains a problem,&quot; he said.    Mr. Eaton said that expected reductions in operating expenses would produce the projected profit for the fourth quarter. The company had a loss of $4 million in last year's fourth quarter and $35.5 million for all of 1987.    The company also announced that the FDIC and creditor banks renewed their waivers on its assistance and credit agreements until year end.    In over-the-counter trading Friday, BancOklahoma shares were quoted at 50 cents bid, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
