The crew has so much free time on its hands that Capt. Charles Thibaut de Maisieres usually dines at home with his wife in Brussels.    Indeed, the military cuts are so widespread that there isn't enough gasoline to train pilots or enough practice bullets and warm clothes for the 28,000 Belgian troops stationed in West Germany. And underneath it all is a dwindling commitment by Belgians to what they see as a wasteful, inefficient and powerless army that gives them little prestige.    The Belgians aren't alone. Most other member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are also experiencing shrinking defense budgets and declining public suppport for military spending. And the money issue is aggravated by the often wasteful and inefficient ways conventional forces are organized within NATO. For the sake of jobs, votes and domestic prestige, most countries make weaponry that they could buy for less money elsewhere.    &quot;Increased collaboration and cooperation among NATO nations in the armaments field could save billions,&quot; says Gen. John R. Galvin, the new commander of NATO forces. But instead of setting common standards and dividing the work, NATO forces now have six new communications systems that can't communicate with one another, Gen. Galvin says. Moreover, NATO armies on the central front use eight different battle tanks requiring four types of ammunition.    Such waste and inefficiency show up starkly in Belgium. Indeed, this small but strategically important NATO country is being viewed by many defense experts as a test case for how the alliance will manage to survive with less money. When Belgium began hinting several years ago that it wouldn't, or couldn't, spend $700 million to buy the Patriot missile system to replace the aging Nike missiles that protect Europe from air attack, other nations complained that Belgium was forcing them to take over part of its defense.    &quot;I think the Belgium situation is very worrisome,&quot; says James Steinberg, a researcher at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, a London research organizaton. &quot;It is at the core of a big weakness that is developing in NATO's central front.&quot;    Although Belgium's budget crunch will be felt even more sharply in years to come, Belgian forces are already operating on a shoestring. NATO says the country in 1986 met only about 38% of the key force goals that the alliance annually establishes for each country, compared with at least 70% for all other European members.    Defense Minister Francois-Xavier de Donnea says his ministry is a leading victim of a serious -- and he hopes temporary -- national budget crisis. &quot;We hope to be able to catch up in the 1990s,&quot; he says.    When Belgian ministers decided on the defense budget for 1988 a few days ago, it was no surprise that cuts in the military budget were greater than those for social services and the vast government bureaucracy. Military spending accounts for 5.4% of the national budget, compared with about 25% in the U.S. And with the headquarters of NATO as well as other important allied installations located in Belgium, some outsiders say the Belgians can be sure the rest of NATO will step in to fill the gaps.    &quot;On July 21 (Belgian independence day), I think the Belgians support the army and they are proud of it,&quot; says Henri Demarbaix, who has just watched a military parade march by the Royal Palace. &quot;But when they get their tax bill, they don't like the army any more.&quot;    This may be partly because Belgians seem to set records for waste in buying defense equipment. Largely for political reasons, for example, they built four frigates for what it would have cost to buy 10 in the Netherlands, one navy source says.    The same problem plagues other NATO countries, of course. Peter Volten, a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for International Affairs in The Hague, says small nations would be better off doing a few things well rather than many things poorly. With Western governments unable to get support for higher defense spending, NATO nations are still creating forces as if they are trying to protect themselves from each other. &quot;It's still the 17th century in Europe,&quot; he says. &quot;We have to start trusting in the idea of an alliance.&quot;    Mr. Volten raised a storm of protest from politicians and navy men when he suggested his country could live without its 22-frigate navy. &quot;They called me insane,&quot; he says. But he argues the savings from abolishing the naval force would allow the Netherlands to send a larger contingent to the West German front, &quot;where NATO needs it most.&quot;    He concedes his more radical suggestions are probably politically unacceptable. But as more and more divisions run out of fuel and uniforms, such ideas are taking hold. &quot;We have to think in terms of cooperation in the European context,&quot; says Col. Willy Demeuleneere, who is in charge of training at Heverlee. &quot;It won't be possible for the small nations to do everything in the future.&quot;    The French and the Germans recently decided to create a joint brigade as one symbol of their growing unity. But most Europeans say true military cooperation won't become a reality until there is broader political cooperation. &quot;My wish is as soon as possible to have a united government for Europe,&quot; says Capt. Thibaut de Maisieres. But even he doubts whether that will happen before the Wandelaar becomes obsolete around the year 2000.    Belgium is trying to field not just an army, but an air force and a navy, on its $2.6 billion defense budget. Many experts say it could make the best contribution to NATO just by having a good army.    It's clear that small nations can't continue their costly ways. If NATO nations don't find better ways to share duties, many observers believe such countries as Belgium will listen to internal political forces and make independent decisions that could undermine the alliance. The decision against replacing air defense missiles could just be the beginning.    &quot;We are consolidating what we really can do in good faith,&quot; says Mr. de Donnea, the defense minister. &quot;Maybe we have to do one or two tasks less, but we want to do the others better. I want to be honest with the allies and tell them this.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
