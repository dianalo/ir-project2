In this effort, the Company succeeded businessactivities begun by Dash, Straus Associates in 1977.The Product Safety Division of Dash, Straus and Goodhue, Inc. was formedin January 1986 for purposes of providing its client base with servicesdesigned to support its client's requirements for Underwriters' laboratories,Inc. (UL), Canadian Standards Association (CSA), and Technicher Uberwachungs-Verein(TUV) electrical safety listing certification and licensing.The Company is listed by the Federal Communications Commission and accreditedby the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the National Instiutute of Standardsand Technology (NIST), formerly the National Bureau of Standards, underthe National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). The applicantis an active member of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI),the Electronic Industries Association (EIA), and the National Fire ProtectionAssociation (NFPA).Dash, Straus and Goodhue, Inc. (DSandamp;G) applied to OSHA for recognitionas a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory in April 1988. The applicationwas susbsequently revised and additional data provided as requested. Anon-site evaluation was conducted (Ex. 2B(1)) and the results were discussedwith the applicant who responded with appropriate corrective actions andclarifications to recommendations made as a result of the survey (Ex. 2B(2)).A final on-site review report, consisting of the on-site evaluation ofDSandamp;G's testing facility and administrative and technical practicesand the corrective actions taken by DSandamp;G in response to this evaluation(Ex. 2B), and the OSHA staff recommendation, was subsequently forwardedto the Assistant Secretary for a preliminary finding on the application.A notice of DSandamp;G's application together with a positive preliminaryfinding was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 16, 1988 (53 FR 50603-04). Interestedparties were invited to submit comments.There were seven responses to the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of the DSandamp;G application and preliminaryfinding (Docket No. NRTL-2-88). Exhibits 3-1 through 3-6 attested to thecredibility of the applicant, agreed with the positive preliminary finding,and recommended recognition as a nationally recognized testing laboratory.The other comment, Exhibit 3-7, will be discussed more fully below.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has evaluated the recordin relation to the regulations set out in 29 CFR 1910.7 and makes the folowingfindings:CapabilitySection 1910.7(b)(1) states that for each specified item of equipment ormaterial to be listed, labeled or accepted, the testing laboratory musthave the capability (including proper testing equipment and facilities,trained staff, written testing procedures, and calibration and qualitycontrol programs) to perform appropriate testing.The on-site review report indicates that DSandamp;G does have testing equipment,facilities, and personnel appropriate for the areas of recognition it seeksand its present workload. The laboratory has more than 30 pieces of identifiedtest equipment is uses to perform the testing required by the four standardsit will use. The test standards to be used identify the necessary parameterswhich are specified in the standard; DSandamp;G's equipment can measure theseparameters specified in the standard. It maintains an inventory list oftest equipment which includes the type of equipment, manufacturer, modeland serial numbers, and calibration type.One respondent expressed concern that certain necessary equipment may notbe owned and available at the site (Ex. 3-7, p. 4).DSandamp;G has demonstrated that it has all equipment needed to test theproducts for which it seeks recognition under the test standards it intendsto use. Therefore, at the present time, DSandamp;G has no need to lease equipment.The Product Safety Division, which is located at the Boxborough, Massachusettsaddress of the applicant, consists of 20 employees, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">1_President</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1_Vice President of Sales/Marketing</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1_Vice President for Legal/Administrative</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1_Vice President for Engineering</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">8_Clerical/Administrative</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">6_Engineers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2_Technicians</ITAG>DSandamp;G has submitted copies of the job responsibilities and qualificationsfor each of the technical positions listed above and the employees, inOSHA's opinion, appear to be qualified by training or experience for performingtesting in the areas for which DSandamp;G seeks recognition.DSandamp;G leases 7,000 square feet of floor space in a 2-story commercial/retailbuilding. Product testing is conducted within a 640 square foot room. Visitorentrance to the facility is monitored by laboratory personnel occupyingthe area during working hours. The facility also has security alarm andfire sprinkler systems. The physical facilities appear to be adequate forthe volume and type of testing for which DSandamp;G has requested recognition.One respondent (Ex. 3-7, p. 4) questioned the ability of DSandamp;G to accomplishthe work associated with the testing and listing services involving theindicated product catagories alleging that it is ``a very small organizationwith limited facility, test equipment, and staff resources''.The on-site review has demonstrated to OSHA's satisfaction that DSandamp;Ghas adequate facilities, personnel, and test equipment to accomplish theservices required for its present workload in the applied-for product categories.It is DSandamp;G's intention to continuously maintain adequate facilities(including personnel and equipment) to deal with their workload and theywill expand their facilities as necessary if the workload significantlyincreases. OSHA will, of course, continue to monitor the operation of thelaboratory as part of its oversight function. Any expansion of productcatagories would necessitate the presentation of a formal application toOSHA. With regard to a commentators inference (Ex. 3-7, p. 5) that DSandamp;Gwill use contract or part-time employees in its follow-up program, DSandamp;Ghas stated that it has no plans to employ any members of either group.The on-site review report revealed that DSandamp;G has a comprehensive calibrationprogram for its test equipment which was up-graded subsequent to the on-sitereview report (see Corrective Action Report (Ex. 2B(2)). Although outsidevendor calibration services are used, the Quality Assurance Manager retainsthe responsibility for the identification, scheduling and shipping of thisequipment. There is a written equipment calibration program which includesperiodic calibration, labels to indicate calibration status, and recordsof calibration, repairs and maintenance of test equipment. A computer database tracks the calibration status of all test equipment which needs periodiccalibration.Another respondent (Ex. 3-7, p. 5) viewed the applicant ``suggesting remedies''to a client as a conflict of interest and a ``significant and importantdeficiency''. The commentator felt that such practice indicated the applicant's``greater propensity for consultation than testing''.While the extent of consultation provided might, in some cases, impedea laboratory's objectivity and even its independence, OSHA does not viewDSandamp;G's present practice of dialogue with clients as a conflict of interest.DSandamp;G appears to offer the same service as Underwriters LaboratoriesInc. That is, offering an explanation of the standards and assisting itsclient in arriving at a solution that will meet the requirements of thestandards. It is left up to the client, however, to implement such a solution.OSHA does agree with the commentator in theory, at least, that the standarddoes not contemplate a situation where a laboratory would be evaluatingits own design. However, whether a given laboratory's practice is acceptableunder 29 CFR 1910.7 is a question of fact tied to the particular circumstancesof a given case. OSHA reserves the right to revisit this issue in the futureshould DSandamp;G's practice in this area change significantly.DSandamp;G test engineers utilize written test procedures (guides) to describeand evaluate the construction of a sample of the product submitted fortesting. These procedures are indexed to specific sections of the standards.The procedures are detailed in the on-site review report. See the On-SiteEvaluation (Ex. 2B(1), p. 2), and the Corrective Action Report (Ex. 2B(2),p. 1).The applicant has a number of procedures in place to help assure consistenttest protocol and interpretations. For example, DSandamp;G has a procedurein place to record technical policy interpretations pertaining to a teststandard and to disseminate this information to the staff (see CorrectiveAction Report (Ex. 2B(2), p. 2). OSHA considers these procedures to beadequate.Although at the time of the on-site review DSandamp;G had no designated QualityAssurance Manager, the Vice President of Engineering had the quality assuranceresponsibilities to review and approve the work of the staff engineersand technicians related to product approvals. This same individual alsoconducted regular performance reviews of staff members to assure adherenceto standards and procedures, in lieu of a formal internal audit program.While OSHA considered this adequate for the present workforce and workload,it noted the informality of this procedure and recommended formalizingcertain aspects of the program to assure objective evaluations of performanceif the laboratory expands or the workload increases (see the On-Site Evaluation,Ex. 2B(1), p. 5). DSandamp;G has since implemented these recommendationsand modified these aspects of its program (see the Corrective Action Report(Ex. 2B(2), p. 2). A Quality Assurance Manager has been appointed withthe responsibility for test equipment calibration, review of form reportsand test records, and for the initiation and maintenance of the Follow-UpServices Program. A formal audit team has also been designated to randomlyselect and review reports and test records to insure that proper procedureshave been followed and that test data is reproducible.Type of TestingThe standard contemplates that testing done by NRTLs fall into one of twocategories: testing to determine conformance with appropriate test standards,or experimental testing where there might not be one specific test standardcovering the new product or material. DSandamp;G has applied for recognitionin the first category.Follow-Up Procedures Section 1910.7(b)(2) requires that the NRTL shall provide certain follow-upprocedures to the extent necessary for the particular equipment or materialto be listed, labeled or accepted. These include implementation of controlprocedures for identifying the listed or labeled equipment or materials,inspecting the production run at factories to assure conformance with teststandards, and conducting field inspections to monitor and assure the properuse of the label. One commentator (Exc. 3-7, p. 5) stated that ``the applicantindicates that such a (follow-up) program currently does not exist''. Thissame commentator states further that there is no description in the follow-upagreement on legal action regarding the misuse of the listing mark andof public notification regarding hazardous products; that the follow-upprogram of DSandamp;G only addresses products from stock; and that the applicantindicates that it ``may'' request samples from the manufacturing line,which tends to weaken the program. Although DSandamp;G has not previously listed products, it has written follow-upprocedures to verify that the product at the manufacturing site, as itis currently assembled, is identical to samples of the product that havebeen evaluated and tested. An agreement must be signed by the submitter/clientwhich, among other stipulations, permits DSandamp;G to conduct follow-upservice inspections of listed products at the manufacturing site. The approvalmark authorized by DSandamp;G cannot be applied to the product until afterthe first inspection is carried out. Such inspections will be conducted at three-month intervals from the dateof the approval. Unresolved discrepancies found during the follow-up procedurescan result in the forfeiture of the right to apply the label, removal ofalready affixed labels, and possible recall of products sold with the label.DSandamp;G has the right to notify vendors, authorities, potential users,and others of an improper or unauthorized use of its mark. DSandamp;G's follow-up services agreement stipulates that it shall have free,unannounced, and immediate access to the factories and other facilitieswherein the products, or any component thereof, may be fabricated, processed,finished, stored or located, at all times during business hours or whenthe factory or storage facilities are in operation, in order that suchrepresentative may properly perform the follow-up service. DSandamp;G hasalso stated that it was always its intent to conduct unannounced factoryfollow-up inspections, and to require a review of samples from the manufacturingline (see Ex. 4, p. 5). Field inspections may be necessary under various circumstances. The determinationon whether to conduct these field inspections routinely, sporadically,or not at all for a given product, will depend upon the results of thefactory follow-up and other relevant considerations. As an example, fieldinspections may be appropriate when the laboratory has reason to believethat its mark or label is being improperly used. Such belief could resultfrom observed events or information from complainants. Another situationnecessitating a field inspection could arise where it is impractical toconduct regular factory inspections because of a limited production schedule.It is expected that the decision on conducting field inspections will becontinually reevaluated to fit the circumstances. DSandamp;G, in the writtenterms and conditions of its follow-up services, states that it will makeperiodic examinations or tests of products at the factory and may, fromtime to time, select samples from the factory, the open market, or elsewhereto be sent to a DSandamp;G testing station for examination or test to determinecompliance with DSandamp;G's requirements. The on-site review demonstrated that DSandamp;G has experience with a follow-upprogram to correct product problems and insure the integrity of the label.Moreover, OSHA will periodically review the follow-up procedures to evaluatetheir efficacy. Independence Section 1910.7(b)(3) requires that the NRTL be completely independent ofemployers subject to the tested equipment requirements and of any manufactureror vendor of equipment or materials being tested. The applicant statedin its application that it is a privately held company jointly owned inequal shares by its three officers. It operates as an independent testinglaboratory and has no fiduciary relationship or association with its vendors,suppliers, or clients except as a facility engaged to perform regulatoryand compliance testing. Moreover, no officer of DSandamp;G owns any stockin any manufacturer whose products DSandamp;G tests. DSandamp;G has stated that it will maintain this same level of independencethroughout its existence as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory.Creditable Reports/Complaint Handling Section 1910.7(b)(4) provides that an OSHA recognized NRTL must maintaineffective procedures for producing creditable findings and reports thatare objective and without bias. The laboratory, in order to be recognized,must also maintain effective procedures for handling complaints under afair and reasonable system. The DSandamp;G application as well as the on-site review report indicatethat DSandamp;G does maintain effective procedures for producing creditablefindings and reports that are objective. As part of the review, severaltest reports were reviewed and found to be consistent with the intent ofandSection;1910.7(b)(4)(i) to produce creditable findings and reports. Thisrequirement is, however, essentially procedural in nature (see 53 FR 12111,4/12/88). OSHA believes that its evaluation of DSandamp;G's capabilities,including its personnel, equipment, facilities, calibration program, andquality assurance program, as well as its independence, among other things,indicates that there are appropriate procedures being implemented to produceobjective test reports that are without bias. The requirement that a laboratory have a fair and reasonable system forhandling complaints was intended to allow interested parties an avenueof redress when, for example, it is believed that an item has been improperlylabeled or that an inappropriate test procedure has been applied. It wasnot intended to interfere with any laboratory's recognized responsibilityto decide whether to approve, list, label, or certify any particular typeof equipment or material which it had tested. Indeed, many of the ANSItest standards include in the preface a statement specifically indicatingthat an item may not be acceptable even though it may meet all the testcriteria. Rather, 29 CFR 1910.7(b)(4)(ii) was intended to help settle complaintsand disputes after an item has been approved, listed, labeled, or certified.DSandamp;G has a program to assure that the complaints of any interestedparty, including users of the product, will be fairly handled and resolved.Its procedure requires that the complaint first be presented for resolutionin house. If the dispute cannot be resolved, there is a procedure for referringthe issue to an impartial third person for resolution. One respondent (Ex. 3-7, p. 5) objected to DSandamp;G's dispute handlingprocedure on the basis that the results would lack consistency as differentparties would be involved and different arbitrators could be selected.The essential ingredient in this requirement is that all interested personshave access to a dispute handling system which is both ``fair and reasonable''(of <T3>ASME </T3>v. <T3>Hydrolevel </T3>456 U.S. 556, 102 S.Ct. 1935 (1982)). Arbitration andmediation are long recognized and satisfactory methods of resolving disputesbetween private parties and are consistent with 29 CFR 1910.7(b)(4)(ii).Test Standards Section 1910.7 requires that a nationally recognized testing laboratoryuse ``appropriate test standards''. The standard defines an appropriatetest standard as a document which specifies the safety requirements forspecific equipment or a class of equipment and is recognized in the UnitedStates as providing an adequate level of safety, compatible with and maintainedcurrent with periodic revisions of applicable national codes, and developedby a standards developing organization under a system of providing forbroad input from interested parties andSection; 1910.7(c) (1), (2), and (3)).The standard also designates as ``appropriate'' any standard that is currentlydesignated as an ANSI safety designated product standard or an ASTM teststandard used for evaluation of products or materials. (See andSection; 1910.7(c)(4)).Laboratories may also use other test standards that the Assistant Secretaryof Labor has evaluated to determine that such standard provides an adequatelevel of safety. (See andSection; 1910.7(d)). In this case, DSandamp;G hasindicated that it will use the ANSI/UL and UL test standards listed below.The ANSI standard (ANSI/UL #1012_Power Supplies) is an appropriate teststandard within the meaning of 29 CFR 1910.0(b) and (c)(4). As to the othertest standards DSandamp;G has applied to use (UL #478, UL #1459, and UL #544),OSHA has examined the status of the Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL)Standards for Safety and, in particular, the method of their development,revision and implementation and has determined that they are appropriatetest standards under the criteria described in 29 CFR 1910.7 (1), (2),and (3). That is, these standards specify the safety requirements for specificequipment or classes of equipment and are recognized in the United Statesas safety standards providing adequate levels of safety; are compatiblewith and remain current with periodic revisions of applicable nationalcodes and installation standards; and are developed by a standards developingorganization (i.e. UL) under a method providing for input and considerationof views of industry groups, experts, users, consumers, governmental authorities,and others having broad experience in the safety fields involved. One of the commentators (Ex. 3-7, pp. 3-4) stated that the test standards``are listed without their date of issue'' and raised the spectre of inconsistency;they believe ``there is need for assurance of testing to latest versionsof the standard''. DSandamp;G indicated that part of its testing includesa Revision Subscription Service to automatically obtain the latest revisionsof the standards (see on-site review report). The procedures identifiedby DSandamp;G indicate its capability to test to the latest revision of thetest standard. This is the same level of assurance that would be requiredof other recognized laboratories. The procedures to be followed in theevent of test standard changes are adequately stated in Appendix A of 29CFR 1910.7. Other Issues One of the respondents (Ex. 3-7) raised a number of issues that were notdirectly relevant to the issue of DSandamp;G meeting the definition of anNRTL as set forth in 29 CFR 1910.7. These comments were general criticismsof the standard. For example, one such comment focused on the need to designateand use a single test standard for each product. (Ex. 3-7, pp. 1-2). Thisissue had been raised by the same respondent during the rulemaking proceedingand was discussed and resolved in the preamble to the final rule (see 53CFR 12108-12109, 4/12/88). Since these general issues were raised and resolvedduring the promulgation of the standard it is not now timely to commenton them. Another comment (Ex. 3-7, p. 4) indicated that no information was providedrelative to the testing and approval of components. The NRTL Program does not address whether one NRTL must accept anotherNRTL's listing or recognition of a component. Instead, the laboratory listingthe overall product acceptance, listing, or recognition, is responsiblefor assuring that the components used in the product meet the applicabletest standards. In DSandamp;G's case, where a recognized component is requiredDSandamp;G will require that that component be labelled with the recognitionmark of a nationally recognized testing laboratory. The component vendorwill then be required to supply DSandamp;G with evidence of component recognition.Finally, the component vendor will be required to supply DSandamp;G witha copy of the ``Conditions of Acceptability'', which describes the teststhat need to be performed upon the component in the end product. (See Ex.4, pp. 2-3). Another issue raised by a commentator (Ex. 3-7, pp. 5-6) concerned testand evaluation consistency among all NRTLs. This would be an ideal state which may be achieved in the future when laboratoriesexchange information on a regular basis. This is not being accomplishedby the nationally recognized testing laboratories presently in their standardsor interpretations. In addition, consistent interpretation of standardsbetween the two presently recognized Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratoriesis not the case in every instance. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Decision and Order </ITAG>Based upon a preponderance of the evidence resulting from an examinationof the complete application, the supporting documentation, the OSHA stafffinding including the on-site review report, and the comments presentedduring the public review and comment period, OSHA finds that Dash, Strausand Goodhue, Inc., has met the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 to be recognizedby OSHA as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory to test and certifycertain equipment or materials.  Pursuant to the authority in 29 CFR 1910.7, it is ordered that the Dash,Straus and Goodhue, Inc., be recognized as a Nationally Recognized TestingLaboratory subject to the conditions listed below. This recognition islimited to equipment or materials which, under 29 CFR Part 1910, requiretesting, listing, labeling, approval, acceptance, or certification, bya Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. This recognition is limitedto the use of the following test standards for the testing and certificationof equipment or materials included within the scope of these standards.DSandamp;G has stated that all the standards in these catagories are usedto test equipment or materials which may be used in environments underOSHA's jurisdiction:<ITAG tagnum="15">ULandplusmin;478_Information-Processing and Business Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ULandplusmin;1459_Telephone Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ULandplusmin;544_Electric Medical and Dental Equipment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">ANSI/UL andplusmin;1012_Power Supplies.</ITAG>Dash, Straus and Goodhue, Inc., also must abide by the following conditionsof its recognition, in addition to those already required by 29 CFR 1910.7:The Occupational Safety and Health Administration shall be allowed accessto DSandamp;G's facilities and records for purposes of ascertaining continuingcompliance with the terms of its recognition and to investigate as OSHAdeems necessary;If DSandamp;G has reason to doubt the efficacy of any test standard it isusing under this program, it shall promptly inform the test standard developingorganization of this fact and provide that organization with appropriaterelevant information upon which its concerns are based;DSandamp;G shall not engage in or permit others to engage in any misrepresentationof the scope or conditions of its recognition. As part of this condition,DSandamp;G agrees that it will allow no representation that it is eithera recognized or an accredited Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory(NRTL) without clearly indicating the specific equipment or material towhich this recognition is tied, or that its recognition is limited to certainproducts;DSandamp;G will continue to meet the requirements for recognition in allareas for which it has applied; andDSandamp;G will cooperate with OSHA at all times to assure compliance withthe letter as well as the spirit of its recognition and 29 CFR 1910.7.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Effective Date:</T2> This recognition will become effective on June16, 1989, and will be valid for a period of five years from that date,until June 16, 1994, unless terminated prior to that date, in accordancewith 29 CFR 1910.7.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC this 13th day of June, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Alan C.
