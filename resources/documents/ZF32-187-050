(program)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Writing Code, SBT-StyleandM;Developing systems from the ground up is perhaps the most satisfyingprogramming I do, but the fact remains that many times this kind ofdevelopment becomes a losing proposition.andP;  It takes an inordinate amount oftime to design and write an application, especially considering inevitableinterruptions and changes.andP;  And when time's short, the features that definetruly professional applications (such as programming standards, technicaldocumentation, and user guides) get short shrift.andM;To combat this, many developers aim their applications at multiple users--a&quot;niche&quot;--which also means more maintenance and minor enhancements.andP;  Then thetime spent maintaining the application for the original users keepsdevelopers from looking for new niches or prospecting for new customers.andM;You could stop programming and simply sell and support packaged software (tothe extent you can support it).andP;  One example of this that comes to mind isaccounting software.andP;  But what if customers have a need that the softwaredoesn't meet?andP;  You can try third-party add-ons, but the level of integrationoften suffers, and nobody likes a kludge.andM;Another alternative meets the needs of developers: packaged software with thesource code.andP;  Let someone else maintain the basic application.andP;  You sell it,tweak it, and even write for vertical markets with it.andP;  Of course, you wantto make sure the company doing the maintaining has the resources andcommitment to keep that software running--and running well.andP;  SBT Corp. hasbeen one of these companies for a long time.andP;  Their specialty: X-Base sourcecode accounting software.andM;Now SBT offers Developers' Platform, a package that will help you modifytheir applications.andP;  When you buy the SBT Systems Manager (a shell for usingthe SBT Applications software products), you get a comprehensive, two-volumeTechnical Reference Manual that describes and lists programming standards,integration of products, data dictionaries, program descriptions, and more.andO;The Developers' Platform (a separate product), which consists of a manual anda number of disk-based files, addresses two key components of developingindustry-specific applications: system design and documentation.andM;The system design tools are divided into five sections.andP;  The first is anintroduction, which presents the concepts behind the SBT &quot;engine&quot; anddescribes the files that come with the package.andP;  There are also skeletons ofthe programs that consist of the comments from each program file.andP;  Inreviewing them, you'll understand SBT's documentation philosophy.andP;  SBTdoesn't allow their programmers to simply write what they feel should be in acomment block; the comments follow a specific style.andP;  There's also a strategyto date stamping and the placement of version numbers.andP;  Even the commentindicator tells you something.andP;  In the code, searching on &quot;**&quot; verses &quot;*SBT&quot;gives you different information.andP;  SBT advises you to use your own commentindicator, such as &quot;*$&quot;, for your comments.andM;The next section, Program Structure, describes the files and how they make upthe engine.andP;  It describes each program function and provides a narrative ofhow the SBT engine works.andP;  These programs, while generic to SBT products,actually make up the SBT Accounts Payable module.andP;  While the accounting logicis removed, the user interface handler and much of the file control remains.andO;While I had some problems with variables that were incorrectly defined, I wassurprised at the amount of processing these programs do.andP;  They're anexcellent outline to write programs around.andP;  (Listing 1 shows part of one ofthese files.)andP;  The code follows SBT's commenting style and places a commentin the m0system variable which is eventually displayed at the top of a menu.andO;The code is straightforward and, as one can expect in programs that run oneverything from MACs to PCs to UNIX, is &quot;very dBASE III PLUS&quot; (theleast-common denominator in the compilers/interpreters SBT supports).andO;Accounting is known as a conservative profession: SBT code certainly followsthat standard.andM;This section also includes a discussion of how programs link to and updatethe General Ledger, which is critically important since the G/L is the hub ofany accounting software.andP;  The databases and how they interact is describedstep by step.andM;The chapter, &quot;Modifying SBT Programs,&quot; discusses strategies for makingdata-driven (&quot;loosely coupled&quot;) and code-driven (&quot;tightly coupled&quot;) changes.andO;What are these?andP;  To a relatively large degree, SBT uses information indatabases to control logic.andP;  In this &quot;data-driven&quot; method of processingcontrol, the programming is separated from the code (loosely-coupled) and hasthe advantage of allowing you to make programming changes without modifyingthe source code.andP;  The opposite of this, in which all changes to the logicnecessitate source code modifications, is referred to as &quot;code-driven&quot;processing.andP;  There are excellent examples describing how to locate otherfiles and modules affected by the changes.andP;  The roles of report writers andprogram generators are also discussed.andM;You have to see the section on documentation to appreciate it.andP;  SBT obviouslyfeels that writing manuals is an art.andP;  The fact that over half of theDevelopers' Platform is devoted to the &quot;hows&quot; of documentation shows how higha priority SBT places on it.andP;  They provide a very specific set of templatesto help you produce professional manuals.andM;First, you'll learn how to name files and directories.andP;  Next you'll find outabout tools you can use to create the documentation, such as VenturaPublisher and Microsoft Word (and various utilities).andP;  Don't be misledhowever, SBT does not tell you how to use Ventura or Word.andP;  You'll have tolearn those packages separately.andM;Manual organization is the next topic.andP;  This section describes the componentsof the chapters of an SBT manual, including copyrights, disclaimers,tutorials, and appendixes.andP;  You'll get tips about how to use non-sexistlanguage, what words to avoid, and even how to explain to your users how touse the Enter key.andP;  The documentation also lists the procedures SBTdevelopers use.andM;You can also develop trial programs--limited-function versions for yourusers.andP;  The Developers' Platform includes Showboat from Lexcel Systems, Inc.andO;(reviewed in the October 1990 issue) for creating slide-show demos.andM;Realizing that developers' would rather back-up than write documentation andthat developers' strengths are writing software and not documentation, SBTprovides a very specific set of templates to use to produce very professionalmodels.andP;  After studying the Developers' Platform, you'll be quite familiarwith the way SBT writes code.andP;  You'll also become more proficient at writing&quot;SBT-style&quot; yourself.andP;  This is, no doubt, what SBT had in mind when theydeveloped this product.andP;  I consider it a must-have for SBT developers.andP;  It'spriced at $295.andP;  There's also a $35 royalty for modified applications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
