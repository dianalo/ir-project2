 Although IBM saysthat the final deal will result in a &quot;global alliance with manycomplexities&quot;, it is adamant that the spirit of the initial Decemberagreement still stands: it wants Siemens to take over Rolm's mainmanufacturing and development centre in Santa Clara, California - though thedestination of Rolm's Austin, Texas plant is still negotiable - withmarketing functions becoming part of a joint venture company.andP;  Siemensmaintains that talks will result in a 50-50 joint venture covering the wholeof the Rolm business rather than just the sales and marketing operation; asfar as the West Germans are concerned, research, manufacturing and marketingin both Europe and the US are still subject to negotiation.andP;  Siemens says thedeal may not be finalised until the end of the year.andP;  This is a far cry fromthe timescale envisaged when the outline agreement was  announced late lastyear with an ind ication  of  definitive agreement during the first quarter1989 (CI No 1,080).andM;CRAY, SUPERTEK SWAP PATENTSandM;Cray Research Inc, Minneapolis and Supertek Computers Inc, Santa Clara havesigned a non-exclusive patent and technology cross- licence agreement,covering a royalty-free exchange of specified patents and technology.andO;Supertek builds the Cray-compatible S-1 small minisupercomputer, which offersjust 36 MFLOPS peak and costs from $250,000 or so.andM;WYSE TECHNOLOGY SIGNS FOR IBM MICRO CHANNEL PATENTSandM;Wyse Technology Inc, one of those nine founder backers of the ExtendedIndustry Standard Architecture bus appears to be thinking of breaking ranks.andO;It has signed a licence agreement with IBM covering all Wyse use of IBMpatents over five years, and expects to pay 3% for current products, up to 5%for  future ones; IBM has proposed to charge 5% of sales on PS/2 patents.andM;TEXAS SEEKS TO SET HIGH-END IAPX-86 GRAPHICS STANDARDandM;Texas Instruments Inc is hoping that its new TIGA-340 graphics interfacespecification will be accepted as an industry standard and claims backingfrom Microsoft Corp, Compaq Computer Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co.andP;  The TIGATexas Instruments Graphics Architecture acts as a translator between IntelCorp microprocesors and the TMS340 family of signal processing graphicsprocessors - the 34010 and 34020, and enables developers to write a singledriver that will work with all boards using the Texas chips.andP;  Unlike IBM's8514/A and Adaptor Interface alternative, the Texas architecture isindependent of resolution, depth of colour and pixel size, and adapts itselfat run-time to the configuration of the graphics subsystem, according toMicrobytes.andP;  It als includes a set of built-in graphics primitives, and isextensible via user-developed primitives written in C or assembler that canbe downloaded during program initialisation.andP;  Currently offered as anapplications programming interface for for MS-DOS, it will in future come inversions for Unix and OS/2 that will be used by systems developers tofacilitate communications between high-level applications programminginterfaces such as Presentation Manager and OSF/Motif that will isolate itfrom the hardware.andP;  Texas claims that TIGA- 340 knocks over the IBMalternative, running the AutoCAD redraw operation 16 times faster when usedwith the older 34010 processor.andM;PHILIPS' SIGNETICS SEEKS A RISC TO SECOND SOURCEandM;The unanticipated gallop of the commodity processor market to ReducedInstruction Set Computing architectures suddenly means that the burningissues of second source licences to the Motorola 68000 and Intel iAPX-86families are, pace Advanced Micro Devices Inc, no longer exercising secondsource licence holders the way they were a couple of years ago.andP;  Philips NV'sSignetics chip shop was one of the four second sources for the 68000 familycut off without a penny by Motorola when the 68020 came out, but that worriesSignetics no longer: it now wants to leap aboard the RISC bandwaggon, andaccording to Electronic News, is weighing up Motorola's 88000, the MIPSComputer Systems Inc R2000A and R3000, Sun Microsystems' Sparc, AdvancedMicro Devices' Am29000 and the forthcoming RISC-oriented NS32732.andP;  Its choicecould come as a surprise, because its primary interest is processors forembedded applications and not straight CPUs.andM;COMPAREX LOOKS TO WRAP UP NATIONAL ADVANCED DEAL BY JUNEandM;Comparex Informationssysteme GmbH has decided to reinstate negotiations withHitachi Ltd (CI No 1,666), and appears confident that a deal for it to buyNational Advanced Systems Europe will be finalised by the end of June.andP;  The&quot;additional conditions&quot; which appear to have led to the suspension of talkslast week turn out to be a tax liability, incurred through Hitachi's plan toresell NAS Europe, as soon as it had acquired the company from NationalSemiconductor Corp.andP;  The origin of the tax liability is presumably thedifference between the book value of NAS, and the purchase price agreed withComparex, which turns out to be taxable in the jurisdiction where thetransfer is legally effected.andP;  Currently, neither side is willing to pay,although any tax would normally be levied on the seller, Hitachi, and not thebuyer, Comparex.andP;  The proposed sale of National Advanced to Hitachi has notyet been completed, and it is unlikely to go through until the future ofEurope has been settled.andM;COMPUTER SCIENCES TO BUY CIG-INTERSYS IN BELGIUMandM;Looking to expanding its European operations, Computer Sciences Corp, ElSegundo, California has agreed in principle with Belgium's Societe Generalede Belgique SA and Generale de Banque SA to acquire CIG-Intersys Group andits subsidiaries.andP;  CIG- Intersys is the largest computer-servicesorganization in Belgium and provides consulting, computer systemsintegration, software engineering, software products, data processing andrelated services, and did $85m last year exclusive of the electronic bankingnetwork service that will be sold prior to the takeover by Computer Sciences.andO;No price has been indicated as yet.andM;ATandamp;T UNVEILS THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO ENABLE PHONE COMPANIESandM;TO BUILD ISDN PACKET NETSandM;ATandamp;T Co's Network Systems unit last week introduced what it claims is thefirst set of building blocks for creating wideband packet network to combinespeech, data and image transmission over 1.544Mbps T-1 lines while meetinginternational standards.andP;  Aimed at telephone companies wanting to offercustomers a bandwidth-on-demand ISDN facilities and to use their lines moreefficiently and cost-effectively, the Integrated Access andamp; Cross- ConnectSystem uses speech compression algorithms claimed to increase dramaticallythe capacity and flexibility of telephone company networks.andP;  ATandamp;T reckonsthat Integrated Access andamp; Cross Connect is the only product of its kind basedon the Link Access Protocol - D, LAP-D, a CCITT standard for sendinginformation over the D channel of the Integrated Services Digital Networks,and ATandamp;T suggests that LAP-D compatibility is important because more and moreISDN information will travel over telephone company networks in the future.andO;The reason for going to packet technology is that &quot;end users' needs fortransmission capacity can vary greatly from minute to minute, based on theinformation they are sending, and packet technology will make it easy fortelephone companies to give their customers the transmission capacity theyneed as they need it&quot;, says ATandamp;T, adding that it also makes it easy for phonecompany networks to adjust to sudden periods of network congestion.andO;Describing  as the first of what will be a new generation ofbandwidth-on-demand products, obviating the need to give each customer adedicated a transmission line that's as big as a customer's maximum need.andO;Integrated Access andamp; Cross-Connect instead swaps transmission capacity backand forth among dozens of channels.andP;  Moreover the company claims that it usesbandwidth so efficiently that it can lead to as much as a 400% increase inthe capacity of telephone company facilities.andP;  As for the &quot;instantaneousvoice compression technology&quot; from Bell Laboratories, ATandamp;T claims it is sogood that there can be five-to-one compression without any noticeabledegradation in quality - that means a 24-channel system handling up to 120speech channels.andP;  The Integrated Access andamp; Cross-Connect system can be used tomultiplex and cross-connect up to 24 T1 lines, and includes new networkmanagement features to make it easy to control: an ATandamp;T 3B2-600 Unix computeris used as the Integrated Access Controller, giving network managers centralcontrol with support for up to 32 terminals, with access to standardoperations systems.andP;  Alternate routing is a standard feature of the systemfor quick reconfiguration of high- capacity networks.andM;Worldwide in 1990andM;The Integrated Access and Cross-Connect System is available now in the US andwill be available to international markets in 1990.andP;  Also on the IntegratedServices Digital Network front, ATandamp;T Microelectronics has released the 2B1Qchip set that it claims is the first to meet the American National StandardsInstitute, ANSI, &quot;U&quot; interface ISDN standard for transmission over standardtelephone lines.andP;  ATandamp;T claims that the new chip will prompt development ofISDN equipment that meets the &quot;U&quot; standard; sample quantities are $95, withproduction quantities available in the fourth quarter of 1989.andP;  The &quot;U&quot;interface standard, which refers to transmission over two copper wires, ispart of the basic rate interface, the ISDN standard that governs how desktopterminals and telephones can be connected to an ISDN switch.andP;  And ATandamp;TMicroelectronics and Intel Corp have announced the first results of theirjoint development on local area networks and ISDN, with the availability ofthe T7220 twisted pair medium attachment unit, TPMAU, transceiver.andP;  Thecompanies say the unit allows companies to add users to local area networksby using standard telephone lines - unshielded twisted pair wiring - ratherthan coaxial cable.andP;  Design samples of the T7220 are available now, withproduction scheduled for the second half of the year: they are priced at $15each in quantities of 10,000-up.andM;OPEN SOFTWARE FOUNDATION SEEKS MEANS OF SIMPLIFYINGandM;APPLICATIONS PORTABILITYandM;As anticipated (CI No 1,164), the Open Software Foundation's second RequestFor Technology has been issued to find a method of distributing software in asingle format, independent of the target hardware.andP;  The Foundation'sArchitecture-Neutral Distribution Format Request will follow the same processas that followed in the choice of its graphical user interface technologyearlier this year, which resulted in the OSF/Motif product, an amalgamationof technology from DEC and Hewlett-Packard Co, being selected from theoriginal 39 submissions.andP;  The new Request is not specific about the approachto the neutral distribution format, but cites the specification of anintermediate compiler format, encrypted source, or tagged executables asexamples.andP;  Technology must support at least two distinct computerarchitectures, applications written in ANSI C, and must be extensible toadditional architectures and languages, says the Request.andP;  It must also beready for shipment by some time in 1990 at the latest.andP;  Closing date forsubmissions is June 30 this year, and the Software Foundation says it willhave made its decision on a short list by January 8 1990.andP;  According toFoundation business area manager Elizabeth Cobb, the Architecture-NeutralDistribution Format &quot;will make purchasing software as simple as renting avideo tape&quot;, and will provide a single format for all architectures, incontrast to the the approach of creating a series of Applications BinaryInterfaces for individual processor families - that's the approach that hasbeen taken by ATandamp;T Co and Unix International Inc for Unix System V.4.andP;  Butthere may be a performance penalty - the Request states that theimplementation &quot;should not impose a severe performance penalty or producecode less reliable than code distributed through conventional means, such asApplications Binary Interfaces&quot;.andM;BARCLAYS BANK GETS SERIOUS ABOUT EMBEDDED MICROPROCESSORandM;CARDS - AND FAVOURS BULL CP8andM;The Merchant Services Division of Barclays Bank has been conducting a trialof the Bull CP8 Smart Card at the Dallington Country Club in Northampton (CINo 1,011), calling the project the Electronic Leisure Management System.andO;Barclays involvement in Smart Cards and their potential commercialapplication seems to stem from a number of business considerations that havearisen since deregulation of the UK financial sector.andP;  The money markets haveopened up and a number of new players are offering services that were onceregarded as banking functions.andP;  Retail stores such as Debenhams and Marks andamp;Spencer have their own in-house credit cards, and other financialinstitutions like National andamp; Provident Building Society and Chase ManhattanBank are cutting into Barclay's share of the payment card market.andP;  The recentreport from the Monopolies andamp; Merger Commission on the UK brewing industry,and its strong recommendations for liberalisation has also given the banksfood for thought.andP;  The same body has been preparing a report on financialinstitutions, due to be published at the end of May, and Barclays quitefrankly admits that it will have to diversify its activities and develop itsinterests in technology with commercial and banking implications.andP;  Of courseBarclays is also aware of the coming European Single Market and isconsidering mergers or acquisitions in the continental financial sector.andO;Therefore, given the need to diversify its activities and maintain a Europeanperspective, Barclays is very interested in the development of Smart Cards.andM;Complex consumer needsandM;Since 1987 it has been involved in discussions with the British StandardsInstitute, the International Standards Organisation, the InternationalAssociation of Micro Cards and various manufacturers to standardise SmartCards.andP;  The bank claims that it was most attracted to Bull's CP8 card becauseof its multi- functionality, and the Dallington Country Club project is anattempt to assess the various services it offers, and its applicability tothe increasingly complex consumer needs that Barclays will be meeting in thefuture.andP;  The CP8 offers three main services at the club - access control,both physical and logical; data files which store cardholder information andtransaction logs; and electronic payment facilities, which make &quot;purse&quot;,&quot;cheque&quot; and off-line transactions.andP;  The purse facility allows the user tomake high volume low cost purchases, and Barclays foresees the purse beingused for such things as car parking fees and small scale travelling expenses.andO;The electronic cheque has a minimum limit of #5, and unlike the purse, mustbe accessed via the user's personal identification number.andP;  Transactions aremade off-line and the long-awaited experimental introduction this autumn ofon-line electronic fund transfer at point of sale in the UK is almostinevitably going to be less popular with retailers than the alternative.andO;However, Smart Cards are more secure than the conventional magnetic stripebank card, and it could be argued that the latter requires the added securityof on-line transactions, and the retailer must pay for that insurance.andP;  So,what services does Barclays intend to offer in its future diversification?andO;It's difficult to say really (of course).andP;  The Smart Card is user-defined anduser-specific and does have the facility to carry medical and otherconfidential information which can be accessed only by the user and otherauthorised persons; it does save on paperwork, which one suspects is largelyfor the banks' own benefit, and it is true that many people like theconvenience of plastic money but don't like using credit cards.andP;  It wouldappear that Barclays is offering effective security, off-line transactions,64Kb memory space in which to store information that may or may not berequired and the nebulous possibility of some pan-European financial servicesnetwork - but is it &quot;technology providing value added services to meetgrowing consumer needs...&quot;?andM;SYSTEMS RELIABILITY COMPLEMENTS IBM 3090 SKILLS WITH CHASEandM;4300 ACQUISITIONandM;Following the announcement of the acquisition of Chase International ComputerServices for a price of up to #7.8m, Systems Reliability Holdings Plc claimsit is now able to offer specialist engineering services on the complete rangeof IBM mainframes on a worldwide basis.andP;  Chase installs and reconfigures usedIBM mainframes and has particular expertise in the mid-range 4300 series.andO;Consequently, its activities complement those of Enterprise which waspurchased in March and which specialises on revamping the top-end 308X and3090 series.andP;  Chase, which currently has an annual turnover of #2.2m has beenacquired for an initial consideration of #5m with an additional payment of upto #2.8m to be paid contingent on Chase's pre-tax profit performance risingby 226% to #1.8m in the next financial year.andP;  According to SystemsReliability this latest acquisition, following those of Enterprise ComputerSystems, Aquix and South East Computers, completes the first phase of thediversifying company's ambitious expansion programme.andM;UNISYS ESPANA GREW BY 20% IN 1988andM;Unisys Espana SA reports turnover for 1988 at over $244m, a 19.6% increase on1987.andP;  Of that figure $222.4m came from the national market, while export (ofConvergent B-series computers made since last June in Unisys' new Barcelonaplant, and printers manufactured for Unisys by Fujitsu at its Malaga plant)turned over $21m.andP;  The company says that the most important growth has beenin distributed departmental mini and microcomputer systems, but demand formainframes also increased 12% due, the company claims, to launch of the newnew 2200/400 and 2200/600 the end of September.andP;  The services divisionincreased turnover by 28%.andP;  In addition to the new plant at Barcelona, Unisysalso opened an international sales office in Madrid last year and increasedstaff by 14% to 704.andP;  Activities this year include a contract with theDepartment of Employment for computer systems worth $82,000.andM;STC $27.5M HONG KONG-TAIWAN CABLE PACTandM;STC Plc has won a contract worth $27.5m for the supply of an optical fibresubmarine system to link Hong Kong and Taiwan.andP;  The contract was awarded bythe Hong Kong and Taiwanese administrations, in which InternationalTelecommunication Development Corp, Taiwan, and Cable andamp; Wireless (HK) Ltd arethe main investors.andP;  The system will be based on STC's 420Mbps digitalsystem, which provides a capacity of 5,760 simultaneous telephoneconversations, in addition to data, facsimile and video transmission.andO;Installation of the link is scheduled to begin in early 1990, with completionthe following summer.andM;ICL AIMS TO INCREASE PROCUREMENT FROM WITHIN EUROPE TO 40%andM;THIS YEAR FROM 1987'S 26%andM;At ICL's eighth Annual Quality Vendor Conference last week the theme was thetotal cost of product ownership, as the company outlined the role of itsvendors in the streamlined growth it envisages for the future.andP;  ICL'sDirector of Purchasing Les Pyle said that steady progress had been made inEuropean sourcing which rose to 33% in 1988 from 26% in 1987.andP;  He predictedthat this would grow to 40% this year.andP;  Indeed, it seems that the reductionof ICL's vendor base from the current number of 45 will be achieved over thenext few years by procuring more than two- thirds of its product requirementsfrom within Europe.andP;  Not, however, that this precludes Japanese and Americanproducts made in Europe, and ICL was quite firm in its antagonistic attitudetowards the Fortress Europe mentality.andP;  The company sees the cutting of itsvendor base in terms of meeting its targets for reducing procurement costs.andO;For example, a 15% reduction is planned in such costs for this year.andP;  ICL is,however, evidently disappointed that vendors have been so slow to adopt itsTradanet electronic data interchange service.andP;  So far only 15 vendors withinthe UK have taken it up, yet the company is looking for 25 more suppliers toadopt it over the next year including some from overseas.andP;  It argues that theservice would enable it to reduce costs by adopting just-in-time inventorymanagement.andP;  In fact a vague threat was made that the use of Tradanet maywell become a future requirement of ICL vendors.andP;  Under questioning, however,the company denied that an electronic data interchange requirement would betied to its Tradanet service.andP;  As regards the recent rationalisation planswhich it revealed last month (CI No 1,142), ICL once again denied that theclosure of three bases and the loss of 500 jobs heralded dramaticrestructuring prior to the company being sold off by its parent STC, addingthat #37m had been invested this year in Manufacturing and Logistics, risingto #42m next year.andP;  Furthermore, the facilites at Ashton- under-Lyne andKidsgrove are to be expanded.andP;  Sadru Nanji, the Component Product CentreManager told delegates that he had a budget for 1989 of #160m which was splitbetween #28.8m for silicon components, #39.5m for non-silicon components, and#92m for component-related products.andP;  His biggest concern was with the marketconditions for dynamic memory chips.andP;  During 1988 this market had been trickydue to increased demand from digital consumer products, the difficulty thatthe transition from 256K- to 1M-bit devices had caused manufacturers, and theEC's political intervention in proposing a reference price for memory chips.andO;Nanji believes, however, that this year will see a far better balance betweensupply and demand.andP;  John Pritchard, the Manager of Peripheral ProductEngineering, was less optimistic about the disk drive market this year.andM;3480-type tape drivesandM;Last year prices dropped due to competition and over-capacity, and Pritchardobviously doesn't relish having to raise his procurement margins.andP;  Inparticular he stressed that he did not want to see a price rise in Winchesterdisk drives, which constitute ICL's main peripheral expense.andP;  He also tolddelegates that ICL would become more involved in the use of 3480-typecartridge tapes in a bid to offer customers greater capacity in departmentalcomputing at a lower cost.andP;  Evidently vendor delivery performance and qualitycontrol is a problem within Pritchard's division, as he spent some timeexpounding ICL's Vendor Rating System.andP;  This was also a theme developed byCheryll Haydon-Soutar, the commercial manager of Software CommercialServices.andP;  Indeed, software was featured at the Vendors Conference for thefirst time this year, since ICL sees it as its major growth area.andP;  MsHaydon-Soutar outlined the seamless departmental systems product range basedon Unix System V.4 with interfaces and applications conforming to the X/Opencommon application environment that ICL is creating.andP;  She said she waslooking to vendors for complete packaged applications and at present had anannual budget of #100m to spend on such solutions.andP;  This budget is planned torise 200% by 1990.andP;  The Conference ended with the announcement of 15 qualityawards, nine of which went to European sources.andP;  In keeping with ICL's newlyvaunted software slant, a new category, Best Software Supplier, wasintroduced, and was won by Edinburgh Portable Compilers Ltd for its sterlingwork on the VME operating system.andP;

 (IBM seems to havecompletely forgotten that the majority of its mainstream users cut theirteeth on a mainframe operating system called DOS, and now insists on callingPC-DOS simply DOS; Computergram is more pedantic).andP;  The new program is acomponent of the IBM ImagePlus System, designed to support the conversion ofpaper-intensive applications to computer-based electronic systems.andP;  Paperdocuments are scanned and manipulated at the workstation and then transmittedto the host application for storage and on-line retrieval.andP;  The IBM PS/2ImagePlus Workstation Program is designed for high-volume image handling,enabling savings in processing cycles and reduced paper handling costs.andP;  Itsends and receives architected image data streams in compressed format;controls movement of various pages of a document including move to the next,first, previous or last page; provides viewing functions including scrolling,rotating, and magnifying images; enables concurrent display of alphanumericcoded data and image documents; provides document modification such as addinga new page to a document; and supports direct attachment of a scanner and/ora printer to the image workstation for high-speed/high- volume processing.andO;It communicates with the IBM ImagePlus host system components in the MVS/ESA,AS/400 and System/36 environments on an IBM Token-Ring Network using SNA LUType 6.2 communications protocol.andP;  The PS/2 Image Adaptor/A is also needed onthe micro.andP;  Its announcement fulfills the statement of direction made inIBM's June 28, 1988 announcement (sounds a bit like those bits in the NewTestament where events are hallowed by the writer pointing out that byhappening the way they did, they fulfilled some Old Testament prophecy).andP;  Theprogram will be available on September 29 and will cost $600 in the US.andM;Here are the promised new ImagescreensandM;Oh and IBM wants people to buy new screens for their PS/2s if they are goingto use ImagePlus.andP;  The PS/2 Monochrome Display 8508 is a horizontal 19&quot;analogue, multimode, white phosphor raster display capable of displaying upto 1,600 by 1,200 pixels at 114 pels-per-inch in a viewable area of 14.0&quot; by10.5&quot;; using the large screen enables display of either coded or non-codeddata in image and text applications.andP;  The fact that it is analogue, says IBM,increases the capability for selecting grey shades.andP;  Up to 16 out of 256shades of grey, dependent on the screen mode being used, are available whenthe thing is attached to the PS/2 Image Adaptor/A, and programmable selectionof screen resolution is supported.andP;  The display contains a self-regulatingpower supply accommodating voltage that can be used in both the US and Europe- this is a new IBM policy - make one version for the world.andP;  The thing costs$1,300 from September 29.andP;  And if you don't like that one, you can alwayswait for the PS/2 Monochrome Display 8506, a vertical or portrait 17&quot;analogue, multimode, white phosphor raster display that puts up 848 by 1,200pixels at 100 pels-per-inch in a viewable area of 8.5&quot; by 11.8&quot;, so the thingcan put up a full A4 page.andP;  All the other features are the same as for the8508 - including the $1,300 price - but the thing doesn't arrive untilDecember 29.andP;  But while the 8508 landscape monitor provides two display areason the screen, side-by-side, to handle coded data and display imagesconcurrently, users of the 8506 have to use a second monitor on the same PS/2to look at the coded data application; users of MVS/ESA can use a separateIBM 3270 terminal for the coded data.andM;Delivery dates for ImagePlus for  MVS/ESA, AS/400 and SystemandM;36 usersandM;The workstation program ain't much use unless you've got the host end ofImagePlus as well, so what of the ImagePlus System MVS/ESA, AS/400 andSystem/36?andP;  Rappelons que, as they say Outre Manche, the IBM ImagePlus SystemMVS/ESA, AS/400 and System/36 consist of a set of components, includingapplication and storage management software, on-line optical storage, andPS/2-based image workstations to provide comprehensive hardware and softwaresystems to facilitate input, storage, retrieval and distribution of imagedocuments using SAA Common Communications Support.andP;  Functions are included tomanage flow of work through the system and to provide a consistent method oforganising image documents and distributing them for processing.andP;  IBM hasn'tsaid much about optical disks, although those with long memories willremember that substantial parts of the system come from Filenet Corp, CostaMesa, California.andP;  Becoming more and more incomprehensible is IBM's use ofthe term RPQ, which once stood for Request Price Quotation, and doesn't seemto mean anything very much now.andP;  The original connotation was of a productthat was a special, made available as a favour to a small group of customers,and specifically had no price attached.andP;  Now, none of those things apply, andsome of the essential parts of a full ImagePlus system are labelled RPQs.andO;Thus it is that the Optical Library Unit RPQ and the Optical Disk Drive RPQwill be available on September 29, with the MVS/ESA Direct Attachment RPQfollowing in December 29, 1989.andP;  Also out in December is MVS/ESA FolderApplication Facility 1; MVS/ESA Object Distribution Manager 1; MVS DataFacility Product 3.2; the System 36 Workfolder application is September 29,but AS/400 users must wait until March 1990.andP;  Further details of the IBMImagePlus system were given last June in CI Nos 961 and 962.andM;TELEFONICA-BARCELONA MAKES INVESTMENTS TO WELCOME 1992 OLYMPIADandM;Telefonica-Barcelona makes enormous investments to welcome worldandM;to 1992 OlympiadandM;One of the most pressing questions in Spain at the moment with both the 1992Single European Market and the Olympic Games just around the corner, iswhether Telefonica de Espana SA will be able to cope with the country'stelecommunications requirements.andP;  Telefonica-Barcelona's recent annual reportshows that the company has succeeded, in this region, in reducing the waitinglist for lines to 36,951 from 1987's figure of 44,097 and is laboriouslyimproving the service it offers, increasing the rate of installation of linesby 19% while demand went up only 11%.andP;  Furthermore, digital connections wereup 182%, staff increased by 700, while total investment in Barcelona was$309m, up 53% on 1987.andP;  With regard to demand, the most notable increaseswere for services such as X25 (up 99%), cellular phones (up 141%), andIbercom (up 282%), while, in actual traffic, international calls increased by28% and cellular mobile phone calls went up 188%.andP;  In response, Telefonicaincreased the number of X25 ports available by 36%, lines by 34% and fibreoptic cable by 172%.andP;  Looking to the future, Telefonica-Barcelona's budgetfor 1989 comes out at $667m which is 116% up on that for 1988.andP;  The Reportalso mentions Telefonica's main telecommunications projects.andP;  These includethe laying of a ring channel around the Olympic Games stadium and villagearea to enable phone links to be tapped in as required.andP;  Optical fibre cableswill be installed in the channelling to support delivery of speech, data andvideo over Telefonica's network.andP;  Secondly, the Olympic Village is to bereconverted into homes after the Games and Telefonica has recently signed acontract of sale with Barcelona's council for a $1.2m plot in the Villagewhere the telephone company will build its $25.6m &quot;Barcelona-92&quot; telephoneexchange to deal with telecommunications in the north and north-east of thecity both during and after the Games.andP;  The building will consist of twosections, one housing 20,000 digital lines, an Iberpac packet- switchingcentre to connect terminals in the Village to the rest of the network, anIbermic centre for data and image high speed circuit connections and a basestation for the mobile phone and and radiopaging services; the other willhouse the administrative offices and management.andM;Barcelona TeleportandM;The building will also be an international exchange distributing foreignphone traffic from surrounding provinces via optical fibre cable to France,submarine communications (MAT-2 and EMOS cables) to Italy, Greece, Turkey andIsrael, and via TAT-9 cable to the UK, the US and Canada; it will also housethe international transmission and data maintenance centre.andP;  The thirdTelefonica project is the $252m Telecommunications Tower to support all typesof microwave service including Telefonica services, broadcasting of TV and FMservices in the metropolitan area, connection of TV production centres to thebroadcasting centre, interconnection of the mobile TV radio links and a basestation for any type of private radiotelephony.andP;  An earth station for alltypes of international communications via satellite is also planned.andP;  It willhave several parabolic antennae and an advanced satellite tracking system,enabling telegraphy services, high speed data transfer, videoconferences,faxes and TV signals to be provided via Intelsat and Eutelsat.andP;  Other plansinclude, the Barcelona Teleport consisting of a satellite farm with parabolicantennae for the IBS and SMS services via satellites and an annexe building,complete with all the transmission and radio equipment required for thelinking the terrestrial network to the parabolic antennae; a networkmanagement centre with service and supplementary buildings; the TelecomValles Programme for a new telecommunications infrastructure in the Vallesarea which supports Barcelona's technological park and various researchinstitutions; and the creation of a new company to produce and distributeBarcelona Cable TV.andP;  The city will also be connected by fibre optic cable toMadrid, Valencia, and France adding to the province's existing wide areanetwork.andP;  Telefonica- Barcelona's future projects also span promotion anddevelopment of its viewdata service, and, last but not least, the extensionof the basic phone service.andM;BULL TAKES TIGHTER CONTROL OF ITS SPANISH OPERATIONSandM;Bull takes tighter control of its  Spanish operations; CP8andM;card ventureandM;After two years of being overshadowed by the progress of other multinationalsin Spain, Bull Espana SA has reported turnover up 22%.andP;  Now that Bull SA hasfull control of Bull HN, it wants to support its multi-national Europeanmajor accounts more efficiently so as to provide a better service at lesscost to its local subsidiaries.andP;  In Spain, Bull has already teamed up withAmper SA via its subsidiary Bull CP8 for the joint manufacture of Smart Cardsfor payphones (CI No 1,105).andP;  This  project was initiated by Telefonica whichpicked the French company because of Smart Card penetration in the Frenchmarket, and then paid $21.3m for a 10% share in Bull CP8 so that it couldhave a say in its management and marketing.andP;  The resulting factory willassemble chips in the cards and hopes to produce 750,000 cards a year,increasing this to 10,000,000 by 1992.andP;  In addition, Bull has increased itsinvestment in Spain with the acquisition of most of Telesincro SA and the twocompanies are at present working on technology required by the Banca Catalanafor a new electronic payment service using Smart Cards capable of storinglarge amounts of data.andP;  Total investment for this project should be about$20m and Telesincro will manufacture the card readers.andP;  If this system, newon the Spanish market, is as successful as Bull hopes in Catalonia, it willbe extended across the country.andP;  Bull has also been retained by Basqueelectrotechnical group Fagor SA to implement a major automation systemcosting a total $21m over the next five years.andP;  Bull will supply computerequipment and technical assistance and train staff.andP;  The other main Bullmarkets in Spain are government, finance and industry.andM;ARTHUR ANDERSEN AND CENTUNION SET UP ACCENT SAandM;Arthur Andersen manufacturing ventureandM;Arthur Anderson Consulting and Spanish technical and financial co-ordinationcompany Centunion SA have set up a new group, Accent SA to offer acomprehensive assessment and development service for industrial companiesstarting out or updating their production systems.andP;  Formation of the groupwas prompted by the fact that many industrial modernisation programmes faildue to a lack of efficient integration of management and technology.andP;  Atpresent Spain is relatively undeveloped in production process automation inEurope, but plans for the future indicate that investments incomputer-integrated manufacturing will grow 30% annually over the next fewyears, taking it to $4,300m by 1992.andM;SET-BACKS FOR IBM, DEC SPELL MISERY FOR THEIR WEAKER BRETHRENandM;IN THE INDUSTRYandM;Last week's double whammy of bad news, first from IBM and then from DEC maycause a few downcast faces at Armonk and Maynard, but there are other townsthat will be sunk in deepest gloom.andP;  IBM and DEC - and a few othertraditional computer manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard Co and NCR Corp arestrong enough to take emphatic down-turns in the market in their strides.andO;But the last five years of patchy growth left several industry stalwartsgravely weakened, and times are hard and look like getting much harder inMinneapolis, Lowell and Marlborough where Control Data Corp, WangLaboratories and Data General Corp have their domiciles.andP;  Because if thosecompanies were finding profits hard to come by when the market as a whole wasrelatively healthy, the outlook for them in a downturn is grim indeed.andO;Equally threatened is Prime Computer Inc, now expected to report a firstquarter loss that, coupled with an industry recession will make it muchharder for the company to defend itself against the ludicrous hostile bidfrom MAI Basic Four Inc.andP;  Unisys Corp is among the ranks of the strongersecond line companies, but is likely to be hit hard by an industry recessionthat would likely leave it with another year of zero, if not negative, growth- DEC at least is going to grow this year, albeit at a slower rate than overthe last two or three years.andP;  The outlook would be grim too for what used tobe Honeywell Information Systems were it not now a distant branch of theFrench government, which will live with whatever losses the company turns in.andO;With ICL now battening the hatches, all the signs are, as we suggested twoweeks back, that the European market that has pulled so many of IBM'schestnuts out of the fire in recent years, has now gone decidedly soggy, andthe impact on IBM at the top end is likely to be disproportionate if othersfollow National Westminster Bank's example and put price-performance at thetop of their list of requirements and go for Amdahl Corp's 5990 market leaderin the performance stakes (CI No 1,142).andP;  As for DEC, the company is thoughtto have been suffering slow sales of its high-end VAXes - users areimpatiently waiting for the delayed new line-topper, and DEC needs it too, toimprove margins.andP;  Customers are also said to be confused by the differentprice curves on which DEC has put its Ultrix Unix machines and its VMSmachines - the former face such fierce price competition from SunMicrosystems Inc, which is likely to come through any slow-down relativelyunscathed, although a fall in growth and profits will no doubt triggerapocalyptic banner headlines, that DEC has priced them much more keenly thanthe VMS machines, which it still tends to treat as a captive market.andP;  DECfinally came out and admitted that turnover for the third quarter would be$100m to $125m lower than had been expected, leading analysts to trim theirsales growth forecast for the third quarter to 10% from 13%.andP;  There's somecontroversy over the way the information came out through analysts and notdirect from the company, and gung-ho shareholders are no doubt alreadysharpening their lawyers.andP;  DEC's defence is that it has consistently beenmore bearish than analysts about its outlook in the US, and that it can't beheld responsible if analysts don't listen to what it says.andP;  The share pricefinally closed $10.625 down at $96.375 on Wednesday.andM;BRITISH TELECOM WINS THE CONTRACT TO REWIRE ULSTER WITHandM;BRUSSELS BACKINGandM;British Telecommunications Plc and Northern Ireland's Department of EconomicDevelopment has won an award of #7.25m from the European Regional DevelopmentFund to improve Northern Ireland's telecommunications infrastructure.andP;  Theaward is part of the European Community's programme of SpecialTelecommunications Action for Regional Development, STAR.andP;  British Telecomsays it will integrate the investment into an expanded programme for theregion; the award will be used to develop an optical fibre telecommunicationsnetwork within Ulster, the only UK region involved in the STAR programme, andconstruct fibre optic links to Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.andO;Among the developments to be introduced are special digital equipment at 44locations in Ulster, switched transmissions down phone lines from computer tocomputer, and extensions of advanced data facilities into remote areas ofNorthern Ireland, which would otherwise be unavailable on economic grounds.andO;British Telecom says the investment means improvements to thetelecommunications infrastructure five years earlier than they would haveotherwise been introduced; the company says the STAR measures could cost#100m up to 1992, while the infrastructure implementations, over two years,should secure around 110 jobs.andP;  The STAR programme was set up to improvetelecommunications infrastructures in less developed regions of the EuropeanCommunity.andP;  British Telecom beat Mercury Communications Ltd to the contract;it says the development should give a boost to business in the province, andespecially help the telecommunications needs of small to medium- sizedenterprises.andM;CONSULTING IS WEATHERPROOF, P-E CONFIRMS AS IT LOOKS FORandM;ACQUISITIONSandM;The international management and computer consultants, P-E International ofEgham, Surrey, is living proof of what its chairman Hugh Lang calls the&quot;all-weather quality&quot; of consulting, as it survives the slowing UK market andlooks for acquisitions.andP;  P-E will remain in its four core business areas ofmanagement consulting, information technology, computer services andtechnical services, but intends to develop its portfolio of businesses bothorganically and by acquisition.andP;  It achieved a 35% growth in pre-tax profitsup at #4.5m on turnover that also rose 35% to #48.2m.andP;  The bulk of P-E'srevenue came from the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 43%, with oil,gas and chemicals contributing 19%.andP;  The most rapid revenue growth, however,came from the financial services sector where fees rose 87% to #7.64m.andP;  Inresponse to both the soft UK market and the approach of 1992, the companywithin the past few months has established links with consultancies inDenmark, France, Germany, Italy and Norway giving it access to a network of1,500 staff in Western Europe.andP;  As for the future, P-E points out that&quot;whatever the weather&quot; in the computer industry companies will need adviceeither about handling success or about handling failure.andM;COMPANY RESULTSandM;Adobe Systems Inc has reported first quarter net profit up 95.4% at $7.0m onturnover up 79.5% to $25.5m.andP;
