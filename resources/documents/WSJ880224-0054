The Louisville, Ky., company didn't indicate the size of the possible charge. A spokesman said officials &quot;just now are in the planning stages to make that determination.&quot; He wouldn't disclose the company's annual wine cooler sales.    Separately, the alcoholic beverages, china and luggage concern reported that profit for the third quarter ended Jan. 31 rose 32% to $28.6 million, or 89 cents a share, from $21.6 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding federal excise taxes and duties, sales increased 6% to $271.7 million from $257.4 million.    In response to increased competition in the wine cooler market, the company said it is developing new flavors and package designs. &quot;These changes are being incorporated into new business plans which will be used to reassess the brand's value,&quot; the company said. The company also said it is optimistic about future wine cooler demand &quot;in a number of foreign countries,&quot; which weren't identified.    Brown-Forman acquired California Cooler in 1985, when there was limited competition and rapid growth. Since then, the company said, the wine cooler market &quot;is experiencing modest declines.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
