The pitch to diameter ratio has beenvaried from 1.2 to 2.0. Heat transfer results have been obtained forboth up and down forced flow influenced by buoyancy with and withoutthe effects of variable thermophysical fluid properties. The Rosselanddiffusion approximation has been used for radiative transfer. First-and second-order density changes have been investigated.</TEXT></DOC>
