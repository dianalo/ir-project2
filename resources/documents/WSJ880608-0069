The court said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an arm of the Transportation Department, has considerable discretion in setting the standard. That could affect pending litigation that challenges the agency's lowering of the 1987 and 1988 standards.    Congress, as part of a 1975 energy-conservation law, set the standards at 27.5 mpg for model year 1985 and beyond, but gave the department authority to reduce the requirement to as low as 26 mpg if warranted.    The agency, in lowering the 1986 fuel-economy standard to 26 mpg, said Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. were making progress toward meeting the congressional goal of 27.5 mpg, but that &quot;unforeseen events&quot; had interfered. The principal one was a sharp drop in gasoline prices, which encouraged consumers to shift from small, fuel-efficient cars to larger ones that aren't as fuel-efficient.    Chrysler Corp.'s performance wasn't an issue because it mostly sold smaller cars that met the higher fuel standards.    Public Citizen, a Washington-based group affiliated with Ralph Nader, and some states and cities sued the agency on the grounds that it didn't have the authority to consider consumer-buying patterns in setting fuel-efficiency standards.    But the appeals court in Washington disagreed, saying Congress had given the agency broad guidelines in changing the fuel-economy standards. It also said the agency wasn't unreasonable in considering the possible economic impact of the higher standard on the auto makers.    The decision could presage future rulings on other fuel-economy litigation. Public Citizen and two other consumer groups have sued the agency for lowering its 1987 and 1988 model-year standards to 26 mpg. Competitive Enterprise Institute, a business group, also sued, saying the fuel-economy standards should be even lower.    Cornish Hitchcock, an attorney for Public Citizen, said the group was &quot;disappointed&quot; by the ruling but hadn't decided what to do about the pending suit.    The agency's lowering of the 1986, 1987 and 1988 fuel-economy standards saved GM and Ford millions of dollars in fines for failing to meet fuel-economy standards in previous years. The car makers' performance is based on their fleetwide averages. Under the federal rule, car makers earn &quot;credits&quot; for exceeding the standard, and those credits can be used to wipe out fines that occur later for failing to meet the standards.    In Detroit, a GM spokeswoman said the No. 1 auto maker was pleased by the ruling. She added that the fuel-economy requirement &quot;continues to be a straitjacket on American full-line vehicle manufacturers and the damage it causes should be removed either through repeal or amendment of the law or administrative action by the Department of Transportation.&quot;    At Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford, a spokesman said the company would have had to cut production of its largest and most profitable models if the agency hadn't rolled back the 1986 standard. &quot;We are pleased the court once again recognized that customer demand is an important element in establishing fuel-economy standards,&quot; he added. </TEXT></DOC>
