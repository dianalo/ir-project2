In other words, foreigners &quot;foisted&quot; almost as much ice cream on &quot;hapless&quot; Americans as a large Safeway sells on a summer Saturday. Obviously, a crisis was imminent.    While many people relish American-made ice cream with deliberately foreign-sounding names, few people realize that the U.S. government restricts ice-cream imports to less than one-tenth of one percent of U.S. consumption. Jamaica, the Netherlands and Belgium are the only other countries allowed to sell ice cream to Americans, and with quotas so low and transportation costs high, they don't bother to ship us any ice cream at all.    The U.S. exports hundreds of thousands of gallons of ice cream to Canada, yet Canadian ice cream is banned from the U.S. Canada expressed its appreciation for this treatment last year by slapping a quota on U.S. ice-cream exports to Canada. (Dairy trade was exempted from last year's Free Trade Agreement.)    Across North America, armies of bureaucrats have mobilized to slug this one out. Officials from the Canadian Embassy met with U.S. State Department officials to raise the ice-cream issue last October. Canada filed a formal complaint with the U.S. government in November. The U.S. Agriculture Department convened a task force that spent months studying ice-cream quotas.    On May 5 of this year, President Bush sent a letter to the U.S. International Trade Commission demanding an ice-cream investigation. The ITC has had as many as 30 people dealing with this project. The ITC made a report on Aug. 28 to the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, which is responsible for forwarding it to the president. According to Claire Buchan, spokeswoman for the trade rep, &quot;The president has not made a decision on this, and there is not a deadline.&quot; Doesn't he realize the ice cream is melting?    The U.S. ice-cream quotas date back to Dec. 31, 1970, when President Nixon decreed that future ice-cream imports could not exceed 431,330 gallons a year. Why? That year, according to Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman, testifying this July before the ITC, the U.S. was hit with a &quot;flood of imports.&quot; This so-called &quot;flood&quot; amounted to barely 1% of U.S. ice cream consumption.    How did Mr. Nixon decide to limit imports to exactly 431,330 gallons a year? Section 22 of the Agriculture Adjustment Act allows the U.S. government to protect domestic price-support programs by restricting imports to 50% of the annual average imports of a representative period. Ice-cream imports did not begin until 1969 -- so the U.S. government chose the years 1967, 1968, and 1969. This allowed the government to slash imports by 95% of their 1970 level and then tell foreigners that the 5% remaining was their &quot;fair&quot; market share.    Under the &quot;free trade&quot; Bush administration, the Agriculture Department still has a phobia about foreign ice cream. Deputy Undersecretary Veneman told the ITC, &quot;We believe that imports above (the current) level would render or tend to render ineffective or materially interfere with the domestic dairy price support program.&quot;    The ice-cream controversy illustrates the meaninglessness of some of the central terms in our trade law. In 1983, the Agriculture Department concluded that imports of roughly 160 million pounds of casein, a dairy derivative, did not &quot;materially interfere with domestic dairy (price) supports,&quot; even though the casein imports had far greater impact on the dairy price support program than did ice-cream imports.    This July, when ITC Chairman Anne Brunsdale pushed Agriculture Department official John Mengel to explain what had changed between 1983 and 1989, Mr. Mengel sputtered, &quot;I think, Madam Chairman, that perhaps budget is a stronger consideration now.&quot; Yet the Agriculture Department a few weeks later endorsed a $900 million drought bailout to farmers who had failed to protect themselves by buying crop insurance.    Given all this controversy, what was the ITC looking at? Apparently, it looked only at changing the distribution of the quota -- allowing more countries to compete to sell the same tiny amount of ice cream to the U.S. Abolishing or increasing the quota apparently was not even seriously considered.    In this mega-investigation, the U.S. government has probably already spent more than a thousand dollars in administrative expenses for each gallon of ice cream imported into the U.S. last year. International trade disputes are rapidly degenerating into a full employment program for government bureaucrats.    Since 1987, the U.S. has been hollering for the abolition of all trade-distorting agricultural subsidies. But how can we tell the Japanese to abolish their rice subsidies or the Europeans to stop dumping wheat when the U.S. is terrified over a few scoops of ice cream?    ---   Mr. Bovard is an associate analyst for the CATO Institute. </TEXT></DOC>
