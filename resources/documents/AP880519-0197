Gorbachev might notwant to wait for a new administration.   While acknowledging that ``none of us really think'' such astrategic missile deal could be completed at the coming summit inMoscow, Reagan said he did not think Gorbachev necessarily wants totake his time.   In a wide-ranging interview with foreign broadcasters, thepresident also maintained again that the clandestine sales of armsto Iran did not amount to an arms-for-hostages deal and said theSoviet Union should resume diplomatic relations with Israel if itwants to take part in an international peace conference on theMiddle East.   Asked whether he was worried about the impact on the May 29-June2 summit of recent reports of astrological influences on WhiteHouse affairs, Reagan replied:   ``Well, I hope that Mr. Gorbachev has heard some of the thingsthat I have been saying about those charges, because no decisionwas ever made by me on the basis of astrology.''   In the question-and-answer session in the Oval Office, thepresident said he thought Gorbachev should be encouraged in thereforms he is pushing in the Soviet Union. ``I think it is evidentthat he is running into opposition, that there are those who wantto cling to more of the Stalinist policies,'' Reagan said.   ``If there's any way that outside nations could be helpful inthis, they should,'' he said, ``because many of the reforms that hehas undertaken are aimed at the things that we have alwayscriticized in the Soviet Union. And if there is a way to be helpfulin that, certainly, to at least acknowledge our approval of what heis doing, that we should do that.''   Previewing the summit in Moscow, Reagan said he hopes moreprogress can be made in the area of human rights, and that theKremlin still has not lived up to promises made in the Helsinkiaccords on that subject.   Asked whether he thought Gorbachev might take his time on thestrategic arms reduction talks in view of the few months remainingin his own administration, the president said he didn't know if theSoviet leader was ready to ``gamble that much.''   He said ``we're working as hard as we can, and it's a far morecomplex treaty than the INF (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces)treaty signed by Reagan and Gorbachev last December.   ``We'll continue to work there at the summit if it is notcompleted (beforehand),'' Reagan said. ``And none of us reallythink that it will be. ... But I think that it is possible that wecould have that, yes, while this administration is still here.''   If that does not happen, he added, ``I would hope that whoeveris there and whoever is here in this office would recognize ...that a nuclear war cannot be won and should not be fought.''   U.S. and Soviet negotiators are working on a treaty that couldslash the superpowers' arsenals of long-range missiles by 30percent to 50 percent.   The president said he thought the atmosphere for arms controlhad improved in recent years, in part because of the nuclearreactor accident at Chernobyl in the Ukraine.   ``Possibly, in the Soviet Union, it was their tragic experiencewith Chernobyl, and to see that how an area was made unlivable forthe people that had lived all their lives there,'' he said. ``Andwhen you stop and think, that that explosion was less than thepower of one single warhead.''   Reagan also defended anew his decision to permit the sale ofU.S. arms to elements in Iran during parts of 1985 and 1986, eventhough Iran was on the State Department's list of terroristnations. Those sales, and the subsequent diversion of proceeds toNicaraguan Contra rebels, mushroomed into a major embarrassment forhis administration.   In the interview, the president complained that ``I've laboredunder a misapprehension here _ well, worldwide, I guess _ about theso-called Iran-Contra affair.''   ``We argued right in this room (Oval Office) about it,'' he said.   ``Some people said, well, would that appear to be trading armsfor hostages? Well, no, because we're weren't giving them ... tothe kidnapers. We were doing nothing to make an advantage to them.''   ``And I've likened it to, if I had a child that was kidnaped, Idon't think that you should pay ransom,'' Reagan said.   ``But if I found there was another individual that could getthat child back for me in return for my doing something for him,that would be all right ... And the truth was, we got two hostagesback.''</TEXT></DOC>
