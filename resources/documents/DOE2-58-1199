The azimuthal correlation between the plane spannedby the detected projectile fragment and the beam axis and the emissiondirection of a coincidently to this emitted light particle (p, d, t,{alpha}) was determined. At the highest incident energy studied the alreadyknown effect of the transverse-momentum transfer to a highly-excitedsubsystem consisting of target and projectile nucleons could be detected.At the lower incident energies studied at small relative angles betweenthe projectile fragment and the light particle a contribution growingwith decreasing energy of the projectile breakup is detected. Besidethis contributions of the effect detected at E/A=84 MeV are found whichoccurs however here not in the same dominance. It could be shown thatshadowing effects can contribute to the measurement results at the lowerincident energies. A final explanation whether these or other effects- which are for instance produced by deep inelastic mechanisms like orbiting- contribute to the emission of light particles was not performed onthe framework of this thesis.</TEXT></DOC>
