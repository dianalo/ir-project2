The foreign ministers of the 12 nations of the European EconomicCommunity will meet Monday to discuss the conflict sparked Jan. 1when the trading bloc banned imports of U.S. meat from cattletreated with growth hormones.   The United States retaliated by imposing, also on Jan. 1, highertariffs on a variety of products from the community, also known asthe Common Market.   Nico Wegter, a community spokesman, said the foreign ministerswill be asked to implement as soon as possible counter-measures thatwould slap stiff duties on American imports of dried fruit andwalnuts. he package was tentatively approved earlier this month bythe governments' representatives in Brussels.   But other officials said a number of countries apparently want todefer setting an effective date in order to give the two sides moretime to resolve the dispute, particularly with George Bush takingoffice as the new U.S. president.   Many countries, said one official, want to ``see if there's stilla possibility of getting the new administration moving.''   The officials, who demanded anonymity, said the ministers mayalso want to await the outcome of a Feb. 8 meeting of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. The EEC intends to ask the 96-nationGATT to declare the U.S. retaliatory measures in violation of theinternational body's rules.   Moreover, officials have been following reports that some smallU.S. slaughterhouses and packaging firms have offered to shipuntreated meat to Europe. ``It is an encouraging sign and should beexplored to see how far this can go,'' said an official.   As a result, the officials said, it was likely the foreignministers would decide to continue watching the situation anddiscuss it again in February or March.   The dispute was touched off by an EEC decision to prohibit forhealth reasons meat from animals treated with growth hormones. TheUnited States _ which exports about $100 million of such meat to theEEC annually _ contends the use of certain hormones to fattenanimals, a common practice among American farmers, does not pose ahealth risk.   The United States has urged the Europeans to let GATT's Committeeon Technical Barriers to Trade, also known as the Standards CodeCommittee, decide the issue on scientific grounds.   The EEC has insisted that GATT should consider only whether thecommunity has the right to impose such a ban to protect the healthof its consumers.   But there was some hint the community was shifting its position.   Frans Andriessen, the EEC's top trading official, told theEuropean Parliament, the community's legislative body, on Thursdaythat scientific factors could be considered.   ``One doesn't need to exclude the scientific judgment in thetotal framework of this problem,'' he said.   Wegter denied that Andriessen's remarks represented a shift, butother officials saw the comments as marking a weakening of theEuropean position.   The meat ban was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988, but thetrading bloc agreed to a one-year delay. The EEC refused furtherU.S. appeals for a postponement.   In retaliation, the United States imposed 100 percent duties onboneless beef, pork hams and shoulders and a variety of otherEuropean products. The sanctions are worth about $100 million.   Both sides agreed to allow a grace period until the end ofJanuary for sanctioned products to enter their borders. This appliesto goods in transit before Jan. 1.   The disputed goods represent a tiny fraction of the estimated$166 billion in trade last year between the United States and theCommon Market.   Common Market members are: France, West Germany, Italy,Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland,Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.</TEXT></DOC>
