The December surplus, down from a revised 402 million Canadiandollars in November, left the full year's surplus at the lowestlevel in seven years.   The 1987 surplus totaled 10.3 billion Canadian dollars, or about$8.1 billion, down marginally from 10.4 billion Canadian dollars in1986, the agency said.   The surplus with the United States, Canada's most importanttrading partner, declined to 17 billion Canadian dollars from 18.4billion Canadian dollars in 1986. Those numbers are reconciled withthe United States.   Paul Kovacs, senior economist at the Burns Fry investment housein Toronto, said he had expected 1987 would have ended with a muchstronger trade surplus _ the result of Canada exporting more goodsthan it imported.   ``We clearly had a deteriorating trend at the end of the year,which is disturbing,'' said Kovacs.   Exports grew by 4.1 per cent in 1987 from the previous year,rising to 125.8 billion Canadian dollars largely on strong foreignsales of forest products.   However, imports increased at the slightly quicker pace of 4.7per cent during the year to reach 115.4 billion Canadian dollars byyear end.   Meanwhile, the trade deficit with Japan, the No. 2 tradingpartner, fell to 691 million Canadian dollars from more than 1.6billion Canadian dollars the year before.   Statistics Canada said the rise in exports was mainly the resultof an increase of 3.2 billion Canadian dollars in forest-productsales that came despite export taxes Canada was forced to impose onsoftwood lumber because of American action.   However, foreign sales of automotive products from Canada fellby 2.2 billion Canadian dollars to 32 billion Canadian dollars.   Merchandise trade is only about half of Canada's total tradepicture, with the rest coming in service sectors such as tourism,shipping and consulting.</TEXT></DOC>
