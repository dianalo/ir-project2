EDITOR'S NOTE _ Dian Fossey fought hard to protect the remnantsof Africa's mountain gorillas and apparently paid for it with herlife. Now those who carry on her work hope a forthcoming movie onFossey's singular adventure will spur public interest and donations.   ^By JOE WHEELAN</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The head of a fund that carries onprimate researcher Dian Fossey's work after her murder in Africaexpects a movie about Fossey's life to pique public interest in theplight of the endangered mountain gorilla.   Claude Ramsey, head of the Digit Fund _ which continues Fossey'swork today through the Englewood-based Morris Animal Foundation _hopes the film this fall will keep pressure on gorilla poachers andheighten awareness of one of the closest primate relatives of man.   Fewer than 400 of the huge, gentle apes remain in the worldtoday, none of them in captivity. Most live in Rwanda's ParcNational des Volcans in central Africa's Virunga Mountains, whereFossey conducted her studies.   ``The gorillas come across as very friendly in the movie. It'sgoing to make the world a lot more conscious of the gorillas andthe problem of poaching,'' Ramsey said. ``Since Dian Fossey'sdeath, poaching has diminished. There's a lull.''   ``Gorillas in the Mist,'' also the title of the book Fosseywrote about her research, will feature actress Sigourney Weaver asthe American researcher. Fossey went to Rwanda in early 1967 at theurging of anthropologist Dr. Louis Leakey and stayed on until hermurder, when she was 53, at Karisoke Research Center on Mount Viske.   The Morris Animal Foundation hopes the movie will spur publicdonations to the Digit Fund. Ramsey said that Karisoke ResearchCenter needs $65,000 in maintenance funds and $100,000 worth ofcapital improvements.   Fossey founded the Digit Fund in 1978, naming it after a malegorilla she had befriended and studied closely for 10 years beforeit was killed by poachers on 12,000-foot Mount Visoke. His head andhands were cut off to be sold as souvenirs.   ``I am anxious to establish a `Digit Fund' to attempt to raisemoney to maintain students, to train Rwandans in the patrol of thepark, and for additional census work on the Rwandan side of theVirungas...so that stronger efforts may be made to protect them andto actively secure their survival,'' Fossey wrote in 1978. ``Here,at camp, we wake up each morning wondering who will be next.''   Ramsey, who has headed the Morris Animal Foundation for 20 ofits 40 years, says Fossey talked to him in 1985 about the thepossibility of the foundation and the Digit Fund working together.   About a year after Fossey's murder, Stacey Coil, a friend ofFossey's who had become president of the Digit Fund, suggested thatthe Morris Animal Foundation administer the fund.   Ramsey's foundation now oversees the fund, and the two entitieswill officially merge next year. The Digit Fund has about 2,000donors, he says.   ``The purpose of the whole fund is to continue Fossey's work atKarisoke Research Center,'' Ramsey says.   Three researchers and the center director carry on both Fossey'sstudies of the mountain gorilla at Karisoke and her conservationefforts.   The Digit Fund also opened a veterinary laboratory at MountVisoke in January to provide the gorillas with medical care and toinvestigate their health problems. David Kenny of the Denver Zooran the lab for two months and was succeeded by Barkley Hastings ofthe London Zoo. Ramsey says veterinarians will be rotated every fewmonths.   ``It's a plum job,'' says Ramsey, providing veterinarians with aunique opportunity to observe and care for gorillas in their nativehabitat.   The Digit Fund also plans to build a Dian Fossey museum at thefoot of the Virunga Mountains some day.   The movie to be released this fall will deal with Fossey'sskirmishes with poachers _ legendary in Rwanda, where she was knownas ``The Lone Woman of the Forest.''   Fossey began regular patrols of Mount Visoke's slopes to protectthe gorillas and was known to fire shots to frighten intruders. Inat least one case, Fossey, who had emphysema, helped chase andcapture a poacher thought to be involved in Digit's death.   Poachers initially were suspected of killing Fossey, but Rwandagovernment officials and others have ruled out that theory becauseof the way she was killed.   Fossey was found dead on Dec. 28, 1985, on the floor of herKarisoke cabin, her skull split by a large knife that she owned.Beside her on the floor were a pistol and a clip of ammunition.   The Rwandan government charged Wayne McGuire, a studentresearcher at Karisoke, with Fossey's murder, but no crediblemotive ever was established. McGuire fled to the United States,which has no extradition agreement with Rwanda. A native trackerfired months earlier by Fossey also was charged. He died in aRwandan jail.   Some observers think Fossey's vigorous conservation efforts mayhave led parties who wanted economic development of Rwanda'svolcanic region to plot her death.   Fossey advocated minimal human contact with the gorillas, whichput her at odds with those who wanted to use the gorillas to luretourists to the Virunga Mountains. Fossey was concerned that thegorillas would contract human diseases, against which they have noimmunity. She linked some gorilla deaths on Mount Visoke to humancontact.   ``I suspect he (the killer) was hired, or suborned, byinfluential people who increasingly viewed Dian as a dangerousimpediment to the exploitation of the Parc National des Volcans,and especially to the exploitation of the gorillas,'' Farley Mowatwrote in his biography of Fossey, ``Woman in the Mists.''   Ramsey says Fossey's message has been taken to heart by nativesof Mount Visoke. During dedication ceremonies for the veterinarylaboratory this year, the natives sang and performed skitspromoting the preservation of the mountain gorilla.   ``I had always suspected that they were not too concerned aboutthe poaching,'' Ramsey says. ``But now I saw these villagers hadmade up their own songs and skits and that poaching truly hadbecome unpopular there. Two years ago, I'm not really sure it was.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 24</NOTE></DOC>
