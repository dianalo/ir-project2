Michel Aoun said Tuesday he rejectedthe entire peace plan adopted by Parliament, and the general'sfollowers roamed Christian areas, beating street vendors whoignored a strike supporting him.   The Christian army commander originally accepted politicalreforms in the accord worked out at Taif, Saudi Arabia, butrejected security arrangements that did not include a timetable forwithdrawal of Syria's 40,000 soldiers from Lebanon.   Aoun calls the Syrians, who are in Lebanon under a 1976peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League, an occupation army.Hundreds of people were killed and thousands wounded in a six-monthartillery war between Aoun's men and the Syrians that was suspendedby a truce in September.   On Tuesday, the general said: ``We reject all of the Taifaccord. Lebanon was killed in Taif and buried in Kleiat, where theyelected a president for a Syrian state in Lebanon.''   Parliament met at Kleiat in Syrian-controlled northern Lebanonon Sunday and elected Rene Mouawad, a Maronite Catholic, aspresident. It also endorsed political reforms worked out bylegislators at Taif with Arab League mediation, which give Moslemsmore power in an effort to end the 14-year-old civil war.   The legislators moved their Sunday session to northern Lebanonbecause Aoun threatened to shell the Parliament building in Beirut.   At a news conference Tuesday, Aoun said: ``A plan has beenprepared, details of which will not be announced now, to defend ourliberated area,'' a reference to the 310-square-mile Christianenclave north and east of Beirut in which 1 million Christians live.   Aoun has no control in the 70 percent of Lebanon outside theenclave, and the peace accord presumably will be applied there. Healso has serious opposition from other Christians and it is unclearhow long the government central bank will continue paying his bills.   ``Mr. Mouawad is not an elected president, he is only a formerlegislator; I had dissolved Parliament before his election,'' Aounsaid at his headquarters and residence, a bunker beneath theshattered presidential place in Baabda, a Christian suburb east ofBeirut.   He and acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss have led competingChristian and Moslem governments since September 1988, when thesix-year term of President Amin Gemayel ended without Parliamentagreeing on a successor.   By unwritten covenant, the president has been Christian, theprime minister Sunni Moslem and the Parliament speaker ShiiteMoslem since independence from France in 1943.   Christians were the majority in 1943 and have controlled thegovernment, army and judiciary, but Moslems now make up 55 percentof the population. Their demand for more power is a main cause ofthe civil war, which has taken more than 150,000 lives since 1975.   Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam of Syria drove to Mouawad'shometown of Ehden in north Lebanon late Tuesday to see him, andtold reporters:   ``Syria, which has supported and continues to support Lebanon'sunity, will extend all assistance requested by the government ...to establish its authority on every inch of Lebanon''   In a clear reference to Aoun, he said: ``No one, no matter howfar he goes in craziness, can continue because the process ofreconciliation will bypass the deviationists and all those whosabotaged the unity of the nation and are trying to subvertreconciliation and reunification.''   Mouawad, 64, continued consultations with politicians to form agovernment of national unity that would try to end the war.   At the French Embassy in Hazmieh, just south of Baabda, about500 youths chanted ``Aoun is the legitimate leader!''   Waving Lebanese flags and placard portraits of Aoun, theyshouted for President Francois Mitterrand of France to ``protectLebanon.'' About 40 of them began a sit-in at the main gate.   The French have been the Christians' main protectors since theygoverned the country under a League of Nations mandate. France, theUnited States, Arab nations and other governments have declaredsupport for Mouawad.   Aoun asked his followers to end the two-day strike, because theyhad ``expressed your views honestly.''   Witnesses in Ashrafiyeh said Aoun supporters with sticks beatvegetable vendors who ignored the strike.   One said a vendor shouted while being beaten: ``We want peace!We want to work to make money! We live from hand-to-mouth!''   An editor at Voice of Lebanon, the main radio station inChristian east Beirut, said privately that 100 of the general'sfollowers tried to storm the station Monday night and readstatements on the air, but Christian militiamen guarding thebuilding drove them off.</TEXT></DOC>
