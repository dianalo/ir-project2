Because tobacco sterols may be important in the pathogenesisof smoking-induced lung and vascular diseases, we studied the patternof deposition of cigarette sterols in the lungs and appearance of cigarettesterols in plasma and body organs of rats. After exposure to twenty 5ml puffs of smoke from tobacco labeled with [4-{sup 14}C]cholesterolor beta-[4-{sup 14}C]sitosterol, rats were killed just after exposure(day 0) and on days 2, 5, 8, 11, 15, and 30, and the lungs and selectedbody organs analyzed for activity. We found that cigarette sterols areassociated with particulates in cigarette smoke, deposited mostly indistal airspaces and parenchyma of the lungs, and appear in plasma andseveral body organs for more than 30 days after this single exposureto cigarette smoke. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contained relativelysmall amounts of radiolabel for only the first few days, suggesting thatmost of the sterols were rapidly incorporated in lung parenchyma. Becausedisorders of sterol metabolism have been implicated in a variety of diseasesincluding atherosclerosis and cancer, the significance of tobacco sterolsto human smoking-induced diseases deserves further study.</TEXT></DOC>
