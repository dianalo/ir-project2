Important national policy issues arise in the context of adequatelymeeting these needs, given the large proportion of rural households insuch countries, the desire to ensure an improved standard of living despitelimited supplies of traditional fuels, and the high priority that mustcontinue to be given to increased agricultural productivity. Of course,both the composition and level of per capita energy use are likely tochange if development goals are achieved. Addressing this complex issue,the author provides a methodological and quantitative approach to theanalysis of energy choices, looking at technology options, inter-fuelsubstitution, and the transition from noncommercial to commercial fuelsin terms of their implications for overall national energy policy, aswell as for the rural sector.</TEXT></DOC>
