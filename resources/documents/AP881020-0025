The unreleased report by the Environmental Protection Agencysays low-lying coastal areas equal in size to the state ofMassachusetts could be submerged.   Congress directed EPA to perform major studies on the effects ofthe greenhouse effect and what can be done about it. Both studiesare expected to be submitted to Congress in December. A draft ofthe summary of the effects report was obtained Wednesday by TheAssociated Press.   The ``greenhouse effect'' is the expected warming of the Earthfrom the growing concentration of gases in the atmosphere that keepheat from being radiated out to space. The principal greenhousegas, carbon dioxide, has increased 10 percent since 1958 andcontinued worldwide use of fossil fuels and destruction of tropicalrain forests point to further increases.   Some computer models have predicted that droughts could be morefrequent in the Midwest and Southeast in the coming century as aresult of the global warming. The EPA report says this year'sdrought across the United States should serve as a warning, eventhough precise predictions are impossible.   ``We cannot anticipate how changing technology, new scientificadvances, urban growth and changing demographics will affect theworld of the next century,'' EPA analysts write.   ``In this report we did not analyze or anticipate the reductionsin barge shipments due to lower river levels, the increases inforest fires due to dry conditions, or the impacts on ducks due todisappearing prairie potholes. All these impacts were made vividduring the past year.   ``The drought dramatically reminded us of our vulnerability as anation but it cannot be viewed as a prediction of things to come.... Until a severe event occurs such as the drought of 1988, wefail to recognize the close links between our society, theenvironment and climate.''   Most scenarios say the Earth will warm on average by three toeight degrees Fahrenheit in the middle of the next century. Thiswill expand the volume of the oceans and melt some glaciers,causing a rise in average sea levels estimated at 20 inches to 6{feet.   The report says it could cost $73 billion to $111 billion toprotect developed coastal areas from sea level increases, but 4,100square miles to 9,200 square miles still would be lost. The landarea of Massachusetts is 7,826 square miles.   Environmental groups have urged drives to improve energyefficiency and conservation, and to replant forests, which absorbcarbon dioxide. Just last week, a power company in Connecticut saidit would help plant trees in Guatemala that would offset the carbondioxide its new plant would emit over the next 40 years.   In its studies, EPA convened panels of experts, searched thescientific literature and ran computer models of the global climate.   Some potential effects it foresees:</TEXT><HEAD>Agriculture</HEAD><TEXT>   U.S. food production is likely to remain adequate for domesticconsumption, although export capacity is uncertain. ``Highertemperatures across the country will shift relative agriculturalproductivity northward.''   A moderate warming actually could bring economic benefits, butchanges would be ``negative with the hotter, drier climate changescenario.''   ``Yields of dryland corn, wheat and soybeans could decline underhigher temperatures at particular sites by up to 80 percent, mostlyin the South. In very northern areas such as Minnesota, drylandyields of corn and soybeans could double as warmer temperaturesextend the frost-free growing season.   ``Crop acreage in Appalachia, the Southeast and the SouthernGreat Plains could decrease by 5 percent to 25 percent, acreage inthe northern Great Lakes states, the northern Great Plains and thePacific Northwest could increase by 5 percent to 17 percent.''</TEXT><HEAD>Forests</HEAD><TEXT>   ``The actual range of forests is likely to be reduced forcenturies because the southern boundary may advance more quicklythan the northern boundary.''   Declines may be visible in 30 years in Mississippi and northernMinnesota. Those forests ``appear to be very sensitive to smallchanges in climate.''   ``In central Michigan, forests now dominated by sugar maple andoak may be replaced by grasslands, with some sparse oak treessurviving.''</TEXT><HEAD>Coasts and Water</HEAD><TEXT>   Some coastal wetlands could survive rising sea levels bymigrating inland, but one study estimated that if sea levels roseabout 3\ feet, ``26 percent to 66 percent of wetlands would be losteven if wetland migration is not blocked.''   Heat stress could reduce shellfish harvests in the South, butbass and lake trout harvests in the Great Lakes could increase.   Higher temperatures could reduce snow pack and increaseevaporation, both of which would lower the Great Lakes, reducingshipping capacity but leading to a longer shipping season. LakeSuperior could fall 1.5 feet and Lake Michigan by as much as 8 feet.   Higher temperatures and less snow pack also imply that ``watermanagement systems such as those in California would be unlikely tomaintain current yields.''</TEXT><HEAD>Air Quality</HEAD><TEXT>   Higher temperatures would increase urban smog. A case study ofSan Francisco showed a 20 percent increase in ozone levels for aseven-degree temperature increase and a doubling of the size of theland area there that does not meet federal air quality standards.</TEXT></DOC>
