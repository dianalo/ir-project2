CAMPBELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With barely a flush of anger, they told talesof human waste spewing from train toilets onto railworkers andstation platforms.   Some accused Amtrak, the national passenger rail line, of nottrying to dispose of the problem.   ``I'm the one being squirted on. He's (Amtrak official) notbeing squirted and he's got the attitude,'' George E. Jones, ofLocal 24 of the Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen, told asubcommittee hearing of the House Government Operations Committeeon Tuesday.   Jones and A. Tom Matthews, Utah state chairman of theBrotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, showed the panel avideotape of broadcast news stories illustrating the disposalproblem on the rails, the station platforms and, graphically, thelens of the camera.   The hearing resulted from complaints from railworkers and cityofficials whose downtown train stations have been sprayed with amixture of human urine, feces and shredded toilet paper as theAmtrak trains pass through or stop.   Amtrak spokesman Tim Gillespie told the panel the company was inline with federal regulations because it was exempted in 1976 byCongress from an order to retrofit all passenger and freighttoilets.   In addition, he cited a 1978 report by the department of Health,Education and Welfare _ now the Health and Human ServicesDepartment _ indicating that there ``have been no identifiabledisease outbreaks or illnesses which might be . . . associated withrailroad waste discharge.''   ``In the absence of a known health risk or the potential ofdisease, Amtrak questions the advisability of spending extremelyscarce capital and operating funds to alleviate what essentiallyamounts to a problems of aesthetics,'' Gillespie said. Theretrofitting would cost the company at least $34 million, he said.   ``That is perhaps the most arrogant statement I have seen in avery long time,'' snapped Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairwomanof the subcommittee on government activities and transportation.``It would seem to me that Amtrak would have some kind of concernfor the well-being of people who work on its tracks.''   Ken Alkema, Utah's director of environmental health, told thehearing that a 1970 document from the National Communicable DiseaseCenter indicated that ``we are in essential agreement that apotential health hazard exists whenever human excreta are disposedabove ground.''   Alkema said efforts to recruit the Food and Drug Administrationfor assistance failed when the FDA said it had ``no enforcementauthority over Amtrak.'' He urged Congress to enact appropriatelegislation.   Jones, the railway signalman, told of a Aug. 17 incident nearHelper, Utah in which a train that had stopped to transfer a sickpassenger to a local ambulance illegally discharged at least fourwaste tanks in front of passengers, police and ambulance workers.   ``You should have seen those medical people having to walkthrough that sewage to put the passenger in the ambulance,'' Jonessaid.   Gillespie said Amtrak had no knowledge of the discharge.</TEXT></DOC>
