Manuel Noriega's black-painted torture chamber in Panama City's Military Secret Police Headquarters, I kept thinking: &quot;I will not give the names of the leaders of the opposition; they will not make me an informant!&quot; A circuitous route had led me there -- naked and handcuffed, with a steady barrage of beatings to my stomach and head, and a lead ball drumming painfully up and down my legs and feet.    It had been three years since I visited my home in Panama, where I worked for Chase Manhattan Bank and Bank of America. While in New York I had helped organize meetings and demonstrations against Gen. Noriega, but I had gone to Panama to visit with family and friends.    As I buckled my seat belt on Eastern flight 976 to Miami on Oct. 7, after a week in Panama, I thought about my countrymen's desperation. People whom I talked to were frustrated at the lack of support from the U.S., and that no change had been brought about by peaceful demonstrations against Gen. Noriega's dictatorship. I sat back comfortably as the plane taxied out of the terminal. Suddenly, the plane reversed and returned to the terminal, where it sat for 35 minutes. Then, a security officer entered the plane and called my name. Before I could protest, the guard had pushed me off the plane to later confront the &quot;black room&quot; inquisitors.    Once they had wisked me from the airport to the downtown G-2 headquarters, five interrogators stripped me and had me stand for seven hours. Repeatedly I was accused of working for New York Consul General Alberto Garcia de Paredes, a loyalist of Eric Arturo Devalle, the president Gen. Noriega first &quot;hired&quot; and then &quot;fired.&quot; I was beaten under blinding floodlights. Shadows and voices constantly demanded information about President Delvalle's hideout and reasons for his recent trip to New York. I was then thrown naked into a damp and rancid cell, which stank of urine and vomit. I heard muffled screams of other detainees being beaten, all through the long night.    The next morning, I was taken once again naked into another black room, where I sat in front of a desk. The day before they had threatened to kill my mother, to have me raped by an AIDS-infected man, and to pull my nails out if I did not reveal names and facts about the opposition's plans. But this time, they cajoled and pleaded with me to cooperate. Unexpectedly, I was ordered to shower and dress. Due to pressure from U.S. and foreign-government representatives, informed of my abduction by a friend on the airplane, I was to be released.    I was lucky, unlike the 25 or more political prisoners incarcerated since early September in that same torture complex. Publicist Alberto Conte, realtor Giovani Carlucci, opposition politican Humberto Raynolds and others remained there as I was put clandestinely onto a plane headed to New York. As I drank water and ate for the first time in two days, my determination to continue the opposition crusade was strengthened. They could not break my spirit or my dignity, just as they cannot destroy the will of the people of Panama to have what is rightfully theirs: justice, liberty and democracy.    ---   Mr. Alfaro is a Panamanian businessman and investor living in New York.
