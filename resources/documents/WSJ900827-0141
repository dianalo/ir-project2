Output has yet to return to the already sinking levels oflate 1987, when the United Nations declared Burma to be amongthe world's least-developed nations. Economists estimate theannual inflation rate is about 70%, and some predict it willreach triple digits this year.</LP><TEXT>   All this has occurred despite some fundamental changes inBurma's business climate. For the first time in nearly 30years, foreign investment is permitted, and several largeforeign companies -- including 10 oil companies -- and manysmaller ones have set up shop. After decades of prohibition,the Burmese private sector has been allowed to engage inforeign trade. More than 1,000 Burmese exporters, and about350 importers, have registered since liberalizations wereannounced in November 1988.   The regime has legalized a booming border trade with Chinaand allowed border dealings with Thailand, Bangladesh andLaos. It has permitted the private sector to engage inactivities formerly monopolized by the state. It also hasgiven more Burmese access to foreign currencies.   But open-door policy and other changes haven't much helpedthe average Burmese, nor have they lessened the country'smacroeconomic plight. The military regime has yet to tacklesuch fundamental problems as the country's unrealisticexchange rate, resource-draining state enterprises, and aninept bureaucracy.   Political uncertainty also is sapping business confidence.Though the National League for Democracy won a landslidemajority in May's election, the military is unlikely to cedepower in the near term.   Burma's military rulers &quot;have a verbal commitment toreform, but they don't have the slightest comprehension ofwhat economic reform would actually entail,&quot; says a Westerndiplomat. &quot;There's a complete absence of the realization thatif you want Burmese to invest in Burma, then you have toreduce the entrepreneur's fear of the arbitrary power of thestate.&quot;   Arbitrary state action has been at the heart of Burma'seconomic decline for years. For example, the currency hasthrice been declared worthless. Even now the government seemsambivalent: While the state-run press heralds each foreigninvestment as a triumph of the open-door policy, it denouncesforeigners as neo-colonists and warns Burmese not to trustoutsiders.   &quot;They say they want foreign investment, but the number ofhoops any investor has to go through is just as many as itwas before,&quot; says a foreign economist specializing in Burma.   Some analysts cite the country's new tourism law, unveiledin June, as indicative of the regime's fundamental mistrustof business and foreigners. Tourism is a potentiallypromising industry for Burma, yet in the new law, the firstpriority specified is &quot;prevention of infringement of thesovereignty and security of the state.&quot; The last priority is&quot;providing security and satisfaction of tourists.&quot;   A commercial tax law announced in March is even moreflawed, some analysts say. Probably introduced to widenBurma's tax base, the law appears to function somewhat like avalue-added tax. But unlike VATs, where only the value-addedcomponent is taxed at each stage of production of a good, thelaw apparently taxes the entire value of the product at eachstep. Because of its pyramiding effect, the tax is likely todiscourage desperately needed manufacturing and processingindustries, analysts say, and promote imports, which aretaxed only once.   Burma's exchange-rate policy is among the thorniestproblems for foreigners and Burmese alike. The officialexchange rate is about 5.6 kyat to the dollar, or more than10 times its current black-market value. Because foreigncompanies are required to convert funds at the official rate,business in Burma is expensive.   A longer-term problem is Burma's rotting infrastructure.The country's manufacturing base has been debilitated bychronic shortages of foreign exchange, which meant that vitalparts and raw materials couldn't be bought. The country hasvast oil reserves, but decades of self-imposed isolationblocked industry access to modern technology and equipment toimprove yields from older oil fields. Recently concludedjoint-venture exploration contracts won't add to output forseveral years. The distribution of electricity is &quot;abysmal,&quot;and the country's telecommunications network -- includingonly 26 international circuits -- is woefully inadequate, adiplomat says.   Burma's basic infrastructure problems probably won't besolved without substantial foreign aid. However, thecountry's main donors -- including Japan, West Germany,Britain and the U.S. -- have suspended aid, pending transferof power to a democratically elected government.   Burma's sizable debt also hampers its ability to securedevelopment financing. In March, Burma repaid 3.5 billion yen($23.3 million) of the 23 billion yen it owes Japan, thefirst debt repayment it has made in several years. Diplomatsand economists don't expect further repayments soon onBurma's more than $5 billion of debt.   Despite obvious obstacles, several foreign companies aredoing business in Burma. Aside from the 10 oil companies,other foreign concerns are exploring for zinc and otherminerals. Korea's Daewoo Group, which started with ashirt-making factory outside Rangoon in 1987, recentlyunveiled plans to produce television sets, radio-cassetterecorders and refrigerators, and to set up a third garmentfactory.   Daewoo, Toshiba Corp.'s Singapore subsidiary and otherforeign companies have opened retail outlets in Rangoon,selling consumer goods priced in foreign currencies.   Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., Nestle S.A. and other foodcompanies are contemplating investments, and several tourismcompanies have concluded deals to build hotels and operatechartered tourist flights.</TEXT></DOC>
