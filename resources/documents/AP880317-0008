DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A prosecutor in the racketeering trial of Rep.Mario Biaggi told the judge that another congressman was bribed andthat Wedtech Corp. founder John Mariotta ``was the prime mover'' inthe alleged bribery, it was disclosed Wednesday.   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., the second congressman, has not beencharged with any crime. His attorney, Robert Morvillo, saidWednesday that the congressman was aware that his activities werebeing investigated and had denied any wrongdoing.   Mariotta is a co-defendant in the trial of Biaggi, a BronxDemocrat, involving alleged bribery of public officials by Wedtech,a defunct defense contractor.   In another development, a key government witness testified thatBiaggi sought 5 percent of Wedtech's stock and a 5 percent cut ofall government contracts that he and his law partner helped thecompany get.   The witness, former Wedtech Vice Chairman Mario Moreno,testified that in the summer of 1982 he and Mariotta met withBiaggi at a restaurant and the congressman ``indicated he wanted 5percent of every contract that he could help bring into thecompany.''   Biaggi also wanted 5 percent of Wedtech's soon-to-be issuedstock, Moreno said.   He testified that Mariotta later agreed to the deal but hispartner, Fred Neuberger, opposed it and got into a ``heatedargument'' with Biaggi at a later meeting in July 1982.   ``We have done a lot for this company,'' Moreno quoted Biaggi astelling Neuberger. ``This company is where it is because of theservices we provided to you.''   The prosecutor's statement about Mariotta was revealed in thetranscript of a Tuesday morning conference in U.S. District JudgeConstance Baker Motley's robing room before the start of the day'scourt session.   ``As to Congressman Garcia,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney MaryShannon told the judge, ``it is the government's contention thatMr. Mariotta was the prime mover in the bribery of CongressmanGarcia.''   In the conference, Mariotta lawyer Jeffrey Glekel complainedbitterly that prosecutors planned to elicit testimony aboutWedtech-related crimes from a key government witness who is notcharged in the case on trial.   The witness, Mario Moreno, is one of four former Wedtechexecutives who have admitted bribing public officials and agreed totestify in a plea bargain with state and federal prosecutors.   The integrity and reliability of the four former executives wereattacked by several defense lawyers in opening statements to thejury Monday.   Countering Glekel's arguments in the robing room session, Ms.Shannon told the judge: ``We told Mr. Glekel that while we wouldelicit from Mario Moreno that he had knowledge of and participatedin the bribery of Congressman Garcia, we wouldn't go beyond that;nor would we bring out any details.''   The judge asked: ``Now you plan to bring out details, is thatwhat you are saying?''   ``To the extent that Mr. Mariotta was involved, yes,'' said Ms.Shannon. ``Just to bring out his involvement. Again, not tosubstantively prove that particular crime.''   Prosecutors said they were entitled to bring out the otheralleged crimes because of the opening statements by defense lawyers.   The transcript and court proceedings did not indicate whetherthe judge would allow the testimony.   Moreno, a former vice chairman of Wedtech, continued histestimony Wednesday, elaborating on how another defendant, formerBronx Borough President Stanley Simon, got his brother-in-law afour-day-a-week job with the company.   Moreno said Simon told him his brother-in-law, Henry Bittman,``needed to take off one day a week ... he had to sign in at astate job, a no-show job.''   Previously, Moreno said company officials agreed to Simon'srequest because they needed his help in getting city approval for aland deal.</TEXT></DOC>
