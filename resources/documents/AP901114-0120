Cool J crooned against cigarettesWednesday with actress Carol Channing and other celebrities whourged people to stamp out their butts for the Great AmericanSmokeout.   An eclectic mix of two dozen personalities from television,stage, sports, music and politics gathered on the eve of the 14thannual Smokeout to give firsthand accounts of what made them giveup tobacco, or never start.   The venue was the American Cancer Society offices. The societysponsors the yearly pitch to get at least some of the country's 50million smokers to abandon their unhealthy habit for 24 hours, ifnot longer.   ``Throw your cigarettes away for the day. ... The clouds ofsmoke will turn so sunny, not to mention savin' you money,'' thecelebrities sang.   Lung surgeon Dr. Bill Cahan told the crowd to remember peoplelike Sammy Davis Jr., Yul Brenner and Leonard Bernstein. All diedas a direct result of smoking, he said.   ``I see the end result of smoking all too often. As a matter offact, I've named my surgery room `Marlboro Country,''' Cahan said.   In Philadelphia, a familiar stogie was stubbed out. Advertisingfor the automotive Pep Boys will no longer include a cigar-chompingManny. Since the Roaring Twenties, a beaming, bespectacled likenessof the late Emanuel ``Manny'' Rosenfeld accompanied the other twoPep Boys - Moe andamp; Jack - in ads for the auto parts and service chainthat operates in 17 states.   The celebrities in New York stepped up to tell their smokingstories.   ``When I was 30 and doing eight shows a day, I smoked threepacks a day,'' the effervescent actress Carol Channing said. ``Icouldn't get into a bathtub without an ashtray, a match and acigarette.''   A stern warning from her doctor got her thinking about quitting.But it was Cupid who deserves the credit, she said.   ``At the same time, I met my future husband and he didn't smoke.... I didn't want to smell like an old sewer around somebody I wasstuck on.''   Rod Gilbert, a National Hockey League hall of famer, said he was12 when he stole a pack of cigarettes from his older brother.   When his brother found out, Gilbert said: ``He took me upstairsto the bathroom and hit me on the head with his fist ... and thensaid, `Get up, I'm going to hit you again.'''   The bop on the bean and a stern lecture convinced him to leavethe butts alone - for a while.   After retiring from hockey, Gilbert said he got into therestaurant business and began smoking. He quit two years ago afterhaving some polyps removed.   Rapper L.L. Cool J never was and never will be a smoker.   ``Smoking is the pits. It's terrible. It's garbage. I hate it.Get rid of them,'' he said.   The Philadelphia-based Pep Boys agree.   Rosenfeld smoked cigars until his death, but his image puffed onfor the chain, which has 300 stores and employs 12,000 people.   To coincide with the Smokeout, the cigar got tossed.   ``The decision was based on our desire to promote a healthierimage for employees and customers,'' said Fred Stampone, seniorvice president of the company founded in 1921.</TEXT></DOC>
