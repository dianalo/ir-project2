Albert Wynn calls himself part of the &quot;second wave&quot; of black leadership: committed to improving civil rights, but not defined exclusively by such issues.    &quot;I think we're at a point of transition from a civil-rights orientation to an economic-rights orientation, and that is much more difficult,&quot; says the 35-year-old lawyer and Democrat.    After expecting to tackle mainly rights issues when he took office five years ago, Mr. Wynn now finds himself involved in such issues as tax policy.    Rep. William Gray (D., Pa.), chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Willie Brown, speaker of the California House and a Democrat, are other examples of how far black leadership has come in winning broader political influence. But at the same time that these leaders serve as symbols of black gains, frustration abounds at how much remains to be done.    &quot;It's the paradox in America today -- that the black middle class are driving BMWs and the black poor are getting hungrier and more homeless,&quot; laments Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D., Calif.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.    Such paradoxes turn up in a variety of ways:    Major civil-rights and equal-employment laws have been in place for more than two decades, contributing to an unprecedented entry of blacks into professional and managerial jobs. The percentage of black families living in poverty has fallen from a high of 55% in 1959 to about 31% today.    But blacks are twice as likely as whites to be poor, and twice as likely to be unemployed. Educational differences don't necessarily account for the gap, according to an Urban League analysis of government labor statistics, since blacks with at least one year of college training have about the same unemployment rate as whites who didn't go to high school.    And the income gap between black and white families seems to be widening: While black families earned 60% of the median income of white families in 1970, they earned only 57% in 1985.    More than two decades after enactment of the 1965 Voting Rights Act there are more than 6,500 black elected officials in the U.S., according to the Joint Center for Political Studies, a Washington research group. The figures represent a 60% increase over 10 years ago and a fourfold increase over the past 15 years. A black man, Jesse Jackson, has been getting top poll ratings for the Democratic nomination for president; black mayors head four of the nation's six largest cities.    Yet blacks, who are at least 12% of the population, still hold fewer than 2% of the nation's elective offices. No blacks have served as governor and only one, Douglas Wilder of Virginia, currently is a lieutenant governor. No blacks are U.S. senators, and blacks remain under-represented in black districts, especially in the South.    John Jacob, president of the National Urban League, contends that the Reagan administration's conservative approach to civil rights has fostered a &quot;hostility toward black citizens&quot; that has diminished the public's concern about racism and black advancement.    In Congress, says Rep. Dymally, nobody pays any attention to the Black Caucus's alternative budgets. And there hasn't been a major fair-housing or jobs bill in six years. Thus, after a career that includes a stint as California's first black lieutenant governor, Mr. Dymally says his seven years in Congress have, in many ways, &quot;been the most unproductive years of my life.&quot;    But others, the administration and its black supporters included, argue that the black leadership must be held more accountable, especially in communities where blacks are in charge.    &quot;Why are we always the first to get the lottery and the last to get&quot; a new subway line? says black conservative Robert Woodson, the head of a Washington-based think tank. &quot;We have got to start evaluating our black officials on the basis of what they actually produce for us.&quot; He also accuses civil-rights groups of fighting old battles instead of meeting current challenges.    His views are backed to a degree by polling data: Political scientist Linda Williams, a senior researcher with the Joint Center for Political Studies, says a survey of attitudes toward black leadership conducted with the Gallup organization last August showed that 74% of the 868 blacks surveyed considered their local black leaders effective; 81% gave that rating to national black leaders. (Of the 916 whites surveyed, 54% considered local black leaders effective, and 67% of the whites said national black leaders are effective in leading black Americans.)    But asked whether civil-rights leaders are trying to push too fast, going too slowly or at the right pace, 59% of the blacks surveyed said too slowly, a percentage that has risen every year since the 1970s.    Some analysts say black leaders often face a more difficult task because they deal with areas with severe economic and social problems. &quot;If you have to deal with the one-third underbelly, the structurally poor, then you have to say the black leadership hasn't been successful at all, because that hasn't changed at all,&quot; says Alvin Thornton, a professor of political science at Howard University. &quot;But I don't blame the black leadership, I blame the intransigence of the problems they face.&quot;    Even a Martin Luther King Jr. might be stymied by conditions many black Americans face today, says Betti Whaley, president of the Washington Urban League.    &quot;Today there are barriers that do not lend themselves to eradication simply by protesting,&quot; Ms. Whaley says. &quot;I don't care what kind of charismatic leadership you have, you can't blow them away, you can't march them away, you can't picket away structural unemployment.&quot;    Yet researchers say black leadership has produced gains. Harvard University government Prof. Martin Kilson says his research on five major cities shows, for example, that black officeholders are able to redistribute the last true patronage, city contracts. In Atlanta, which has had two black mayors in succession, black companies received 30% of the multimillion-dollar contracts for the construction of the airport there.    &quot;Of course, there are blacks who live in the southeast corner of the city who live as poorly as in the northeast corner of Harlem, while the elite middle class benefits from these contracts. Then you ask, 'Is that legitimate?'&quot; Mr. Kilson says. &quot;I say it is legitimate; that is how benefits are distributed to other ethnic groups as they move toward parity.&quot;    But black leaders agree their goals are far from fulfilled.    In downtown Washington, in a big corner office with leather furniture along the walls, Washington attorney and activist Vernon Jordan is a picture of the success he sought for all blacks in his 10 years as president of the National Urban League. But when he leaves his office for lunch, he confronts what he views as a sign of his failure:    A scraggly young black man, reeking of alcohol and shaky on his feet, accosts him as he leaves. &quot;Hey, Vernon Jordan,&quot; says the man, &quot;Hey, Vernon Jordan,&quot; louder. Then after a long pause, he shouts, &quot;Do something.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
