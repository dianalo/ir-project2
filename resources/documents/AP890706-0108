Vietnam says all its military forces will be out of Cambodia bythe end of September, after nearly 11 years. What will replaceVietnamese occupation has dominated discussions here this week amongSecretary of State James A. Baker III and foreign ministers from theAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations.   The best result would be a negotiated settlement between thethree resistance factions and the Hanoi-sponsored government, layingthe groundwork for peace in Cambodia for the first time in ageneration.   The worst would be a power vacuum, with each contending partytrying to fill it through the use of force, because the strongestresistance army is the brutal Khmer Rouge.   Hundreds of thousands of people were executed or died ofstarvation while the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from the end of theIndochina war in April 1975 to the Vietnamese invasion of December1978. Some estimates say more than 1 million perished.   France, once the colonial power in Indochina, has taken thediplomatic initiative as the Vietnamese withdrawal approaches,inviting the Cambodian factions to peace talks in Paris in two weeks.   It plans to follow the talks immediately with an internationalconference involving the ASEAN members Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.   Also attending would be the United States, Soviet Union, Britain,China and France, the five permanent members of the U.N. SecurityCouncil.   The Cambodian issue was the glue that kept the Association ofSoutheast Asian Nations together over the past decade, and somedelegates to the meeting in Brunei wondered whether it couldcontinue after a settlement.   American officials seem undecided about whether the French actedprecipitately. Renewed civil war could result if the initiativefails, but the French view that decisive action is required alsocould be a catalyst for peace negotiations.   To Baker, the requirements for a durable settlement are clear.   He said in a speech Thursday it should include a cease-fire;cessation of foreign military aid to all factions; an interimcoalition government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the formerCambodian head of state, and an international force to monitor freeelections.   All the delegates are aware, however, that the problem inCambodia goes beyond ordinary factionalism.   They are aware that history may not judge them kindly if theresult of their long diplomatic effort is the return of the KhmerRouge to power. China also could be expected to share in thecriticism because of its role in arming the Khmer Rouge.   Baker spoke for delegates when he said Thursday that the goal oftransforming Cambodia from ``a battlefield to a marketplace''requires ``our resolve and our unity of purpose, now more thanever.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   George Gedda is based in Washington and hascovered foreign affairs for The Associated Press since 1968.</TEXT></DOC>
