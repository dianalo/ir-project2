The diplomatic push has even involved an unusual request to the Soviet Union for help. Last Sunday, during an international conference in Paris, a top aide to Secretary of State James Baker met with aides to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to ask that Mr. Shevardnadze urge Iran to ensure the safety of the American hostages. The Soviet foreign minister was believed to have done that during a previously scheduled meeting yesterday in Tehran with Iranian President-elect Hashemi Rafsanjani.    Pressure on President Bush to retaliate for Monday's apparent murder of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins eased a bit when Lebanese Shiite terrorists backed off a threat to immediately kill a second U.S. hostage, Joseph Cicippio. The group holding Mr. Cicippio, the &quot;Revolutionary Justice Organization,&quot; said in a statement delivered to a Lebanese newspaper that the deadline yesterday for killing the hostage had been postponed 48 hours because of &quot;friendly appeals and sincere behests.&quot;    The terrorist group's reference to &quot;friendly appeals&quot; was taken by U.S. officials as a sign that the international diplomatic effort, which has included appeals to Iran and Syria, was having some effect.    Mr. Bush held another meeting yesterday with his national security advisers to discuss options on the hostage matter, but the crisis atmosphere faded a bit as the Cicippio death threat was postponed. That threat hasn't been withdrawn, however, and the Revolutionary Justice group included with its most recent message a photo of a third American hostage, Edward Austin Tracy, implying he could be in danger as well.    There was confusion about the fate of Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, a British hostage. Late yesterday, &quot;Oppressed of the Earth,&quot; the group that claimed to have killed Col. Higgins denied an earlier report that it had threatened to kill Mr. Waite today. But there were reports of a phone call in the group's name insisting Mr. Waite would be killed today. U.S. officials say there have been persistent reports for months that Mr. Waite died or was killed some time ago.    Both the faction that says it killed Col. Higgins and the one that is holding Messrs. Cicippio and Tracy are believed to be affiliates of Hezbollah, the Iranian-inspired Shiite political and terrorist organization in South Lebanon. One of Hezbollah's top leaders, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, was kidnapped last week by Israeli commandos, setting off the apparent murder of Col. Higgins and the threats against the other hostages.    U.S. officials took pains yesterday to emphasize that while they don't condone Israel's kidnapping of the sheik, the U.S. isn't pressuring Jerusalem to release him unconditionally because that would appear to be granting the terrorists' demand. Indeed, Bush administration officials are privately hinting that they harbor some hope that Israel may be able to trade the sheik for some hostages, as it has offered to do. President Bush late Monday called on &quot;all parties&quot; to free any hostages they hold, a statement that seemed to include Israel and could be interpreted as condoning an exchange.    White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. maintains a policy of refusing to negotiate for hostages, and has clearly explained it to Israel. But he added: &quot;Israel is a sovereign nation. They have a different policy with regard to hostages than we have. . . . We wouldn't try to tell any other country what to do. We would make our policy clear in terms of how we would conduct ourselves.&quot; He added: &quot;That would be the limits of our guidance.&quot;    Though officials were playing down military options, they might have been doing so to avoid complicating any eventual military strike by signaling in advance that it is coming. And there was one significant military movement yesterday; the Pentagon said the Coral Sea, the only U.S. aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, ended a port visit to Alexandria, Egypt, several hours earlier than expected yesterday.    However, a three-ship task force headed by the destroyer Belknap, the flagship of the U.S. Mediterranean fleet, was said to be continuing on a planned visit to the Russian seaport of Sevastopol on the Black Sea, giving the impression that no major naval preparations related to the hostage crisis are imminent.    The American diplomatic offensive, described by one top State Department official as &quot;a real full-court press,&quot; began Sunday after the terrorists threatened to kill Col. Higgins, and it picked up tremendous steam Monday after they claimed to have hanged him and threatened to kill others.    In addition to the request made of the Soviet Union, the offensive involves urgent meetings with Israel, America's European allies and Syria, which controls the portions of Lebanon where the Shiite terrorists operate. Indirect contacts with Tehran are being conducted through Switzerland, and probably through other countries such as Turkey and Japan, which maintain ties there. One administration aide suggested that U.S. messages are being received &quot;very clearly&quot; in Tehran, but he wouldn't describe the precise route.    President Bush also called Pope John Paul II to ask him to help seek the return of Col. Higgins' body and to discuss the situation in Lebanon more generally.    Officials said the response to the effort has been good and even claimed receiving some positive feedback from Syrian and Iranian contacts. They claimed the diplomatic offensive may have helped avert Mr. Cicippio's murder, but they said it was impossible to know what specific contacts influenced the terrorists' decision to delay carrying out their threat against the hostage. One official said Syrians and Iranians had sent word they had no direct control over the terrorists.    Any U.S. campaign to convince Iran to use its influence to save hostages could be complicated by politics within the Tehran government.    Iran's President-elect Rafsanjani is attempting to consolidate control over that country's government. He has tried in the past to appear more reasonable to the outside world than others in Tehran's power structure. Moscow's Tass news agency quoted Mr. Rafsanjani as expressing &quot;deep regret about what had happened&quot; but asserting that &quot;Iran has no connection with the tragedy played out in Lebanon.&quot;    But militant Shiites in Lebanon have tended to take their lead from Iran's hardline Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who just this week declared that &quot;American and Israeli criminals&quot; should be held responsible for any violence Moslem activists carry out in retaliation for the kidnapping of Sheik Obeid.    Jockeying between Messrs. Rafsanjani and Mohtashemi may be particularly acute now, Middle East analysts note, because Mr. Rafsanjani is starting to form a cabinet and will have to determine the future of the interior minister. </TEXT></DOC>
