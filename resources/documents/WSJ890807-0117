Mike won the election.&quot; But he was only half right. What we actually got is the product of the new dominant force in U.S. defense spending, the Dove-Pork Military Complex.    At the very moment that Iran and its terrorists were showing that the world remains a dangerous place, this new congressional alliance was turning America's defense strategy into a dove-pork stew. The usual band of anti-defense Democrats voted against just about every major weapons program. They were joined by pork-barrel Republicans and Democrats who voted to buy weapons the Pentagon doesn't want. Of course, these are the same people who complained for eight years that Ronald Reagan and Cap Weinberger never had a defense &quot;strategy.&quot;    The Complex flourished in the House, where even the hint of coherence or discipline seems to have vanished. It was mob rule. Rep. John Spratt (D., S.C.), ignoring a deal between the leadership and George Bush, sponsored an amendment to gut spending for the MX missile. This infuriated Republicans, who pounced with an amendment to kill funding for the Democrats' pet missile, the Midgetman. U.S. security won't turn on this issue of a new land-based missile, but the episode captures the general mayhem.    Nick Mavroules (D., Mass.) regularly votes to gut defense spending, but he was only too happy to require a minority set-aside program for defense contracts. Under his amendment, the &quot;disadvantaged&quot; can include contractors with a net worth of $750,000 -- nice work if you can get it. Tom Downey (D., N.Y.) rarely has met any defense bill he's liked, but he was patriotic enough to ram $800 million for the Grumman F-14D fighter down the Pentagon's throat. Defense Secretary Cheney already had sent up a budget, saying the department could get by without the Grumman plane. Rep. Downey, who manages to embody the pork-dove in one creature, seems to believe defense policy stops at the water's edge -- the beaches on Long Island.    Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.), another dove, micro-managed the Pentagon into spending some $370 million for child care and &quot;revitalized family housing.&quot; Ms. Schroeder likes defense spending so long as there aren't any serious weapons involved. She received a boost from Republican David Martin, a pseudo-hawk from New York, who voted to deny funds to transfer a NATO fighter wing in order to fund the Grumman F-14D and other goodies.    In the most hilarious episode, Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.), operating from his perch in the Appropriations Committee, tried a backdoor maneuver to scuttle the base-closing act, one of the few genuinely laudable achievements of recent congressional history. That was too much even for fellow Democrats, who forced him to back down. But they still couldn't deter Reps. Barbara Boxer and Nancy Pelosi, two of San Francisco's Democrats, who mounted a campaign to save the Presidio, the San Francisco base with gorgeous ocean views but no military mission.    Self-parody aside, the Dove-Pork crowd is mounting an assault on a prudent U.S. defense. It's plausible to argue that, in the Gorbachev era, the U.S. can afford to spend less on some current weapons because the immediate threat has diminished. But the House didn't do that. It voted instead to retain old weapons, robbing from research and technology for the long term, when we don't know who will be running the Soviet Union.    The Members gutted weapons that go to the heart of America's competitive advantage with the Soviets. They zeroed out the advanced cruise missile and advanced tactical fighter, both of which use radar-evading stealth technology. Rather than vote up-or-down on the Stealth B-2 bomber, they erected just enough obstacles to guarantee that it will become more expensive, if it's ever allowed to fly. And of course, the House gutted SDI, though strategic-defense research is yielding tremendous gains in satellites and lasers. The Soviets always can match us F-14D for F-14D, but they'd have to spend hundreds of billions of rubles to counter stealth.    The Senate, to its credit, seems to understand this, passing a bill much closer to President Bush's priorities. On Friday the White House promised a veto if the House-Senate conference produces anything close to the House version. Perhaps Mr. Bush heard what Mr. Aspin said about the Mike Dukakis defense bill. If the President can't shut down the new Dove-Pork Military Complex now, other power centers on the Hill may start thinking that &quot;Mike won the election.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
