This section requires the Secretary ofthe Interior to review, in accordance with section 3(d) of the WildernessAct, all lands in refuges in Alaska not Congressionally designated as wildernessas to their suitability or nonsuitability for preservation as wildernessand report Department recommendation to the President.Although large tracts of land in the refuge were found to meet the criteriaof the Wilderness Act for designation as wilderness, not all of these landswere proposed for wilderness designation because of management strategiesthat will be used to meet refuge purposes. As a result, a range of wildernessalternatives were evaluated subsequent to the Service's selection of itsproposed management alternative in the Final Becharof Plan. Three wildernessproposals, ranging from recommending all refuge lands that qualify forwilderness designation to recommending no additional lands for wildernessdesignation, were examined in the Draft Statement. The Record of Decisionfor the Final Becharof Plan recommended that an additional 347,000 acresbe proposed for designation as wilderness as does the proposed action inthe Wilderness Review Amendment and Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement.The wilderness review in the Final Becharof Plan/Environmental Impact Statement/WildernessReview discussed the wilderness suitability of lands on the refuge, butdid not adequately evaluate the environmental impacts of the wildernessproposal. To ensure full compliance with the Wilderness Act and the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service has prepared thisWilderness Review Amendment and Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement,clearly discussing the proposal for and environmental impacts of wildernessdesignation on the refuge.All agencies and persons wishing to comment are urged to do so as soonas possible. However, all comments received by the date given above willbe considered in preparation of the Final Supplemental Environmental ImpactStatement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Bruce Blanchard,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Environmental Project Review</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-15292 Filed 7-7-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-55-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
