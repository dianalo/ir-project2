<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-78-1188 </DOCNO><TEXT>Of the transition metals, osmium forms the most neutral binary carbonyls.The crystal structures of Os{sub 3}(CO){sub 12}, Os{sub 5}(CO){sub 16},Os{sub 5}(CO){sub 19}, Os{sub 6}(CO){sub 18}, Os{sub 7}(CO){sub 21},and Os{sub 8}(CO){sub 23} have been determined. Pentacarbonylosmium,Os(CO){sub 5}, and nonacarbonyldiosmium, Os{sub 2}(CO){sub 9}, are alsoknown as is Os{sub 6}(CO){sub 21}, previously considered to be Os{sub6}(CO){sub 20}. However, to their knowledge there are no previous reportsof a tetranuclear binary carbonyl of osmium. Given the stability of Os{sub3}(CO){sub 12} and allowing for the increase in nonbonded interactions,one might expect that Os{sub 4}(CO){sub 16} with a square arrangementof metal atoms would be stable. Here they report the synthesis and structureof Os{sub 4}(CO){sub 15} the first tetranuclear binary carbonyl of osmium,along with the synthesis and structure of (eta{sup 5}-C{sub 5}Me{sub5})(OC)IrOs{sub 3}(CO){sub 11}. These clusters have unusual planar skeletonswith adjacent short and long metal-metal bonds.</TEXT></DOC>
