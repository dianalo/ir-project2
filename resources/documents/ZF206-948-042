 Once theexclusive preserve of corporate engineering departments equipped withexpensive mainframes and minicomputers, CADD systems have dropped both inprice and computing requirements right into the environment of the office PC.andO;Yet while many users could profit by using CADD programs, they remain largelyunknown outside engineering circles.andM;Spreadsheets offer an instructive parallel.andP;  When you saw your firstelectronic spreadsheet, you probably thought, &quot;Gee, that's a neat tool--but Idon't have a lot of applications for it.&quot;andP;  But Lotus 1-2-3 long ago outgrewits roots in the accounting world.andP;  Engineers began using it to analyze theirdesigns, home builders began using it to keep track of materials andconstruction costs, and doctors began using it to keep billing records.andM;Similarly, while CADD has single-handedly revolutionized the architecture andengineering industries, you don't have to be an engineer to reap itsbenefits.andP;  CADD is for everyone.andP;  And now that inexpensive CADD software canbe had for less than the cost of a good word processor, it has suddenly beenthrust within reach of the average user.andM;This PC Lab Notes will look at CADD from the perspective of the typical homeor business PC user.andP;  I'll try to explain its terminology and basic conceptsand show you some of the everyday situations where CADD can increase thelevel of your own productivity.andP;  Hopefully, that will be enough for you todecide that a CADD package deserves a place on the shelf right alongside yourfavorite spreadsheet or word processor.andM;WHAT IS CADD?andM;CADD is an acronym for computer-aided drafting and design.andP;  Simply put, itgives you a way to create precise sketches and pictures on your PC that arecomparable to what a skilled artist or draftsman would create on paper usingrulers, T squares, and other tools of the trade.andP;  CADD programs are similarto the mouse-driven paint programs made popular by the Macintosh, but theylean more toward detailed, scaled images than free-hand drawings.andM;With CADD you can whip up a quick diagram to include in a memo you'repreparing on your word processor, create a scale model of your office toexperiment with different furniture arrangements, or create a pictorialinformation database.andP;  One of the great benefits of CADD is that once you'vedone the work up front to create an image, you can go back and edit it asmany times as you like without compromising its integrity.andP;  And CADD programspack an arsenal of features that make editing easy.andM;Consider the steps that you would take to create a simple sketch of the floorplan of your house.andP;  You would start by selecting a sheet of paper andchoosing a drawing scale that would let you fit the entire plan on a singlesheet.andP;  With CADD software, you go through the same process.andP;  Select a sheetsize and a drawing scale, and the borders of the blank page are displayed onyour screen.andP;  Unlike your hand drawing, however, if the entire page won't fiton the screen, with CADD you can zoom out until it does or zoom in untilyou're at a comfortable range, and then pan around to reach different partsof the page.andM;On paper, next you'd make an outline of the interior and exterior walls usinga ruler or triangle to draw the lines straight and to make sure theyintersect at right angles.andP;  With CADD, no straightedge is required.andP;  Togenerate a line, you simply choose the LINE function from a menu and use yourmouse to point to the spot where one end of the line should be anchored.andO;Then you'd either type in numbers indicating the length and direction of theline or you'd point to whether the other end should fall.andP;  The CADD programdraws the line between the two points.andM;A number of standard CADD facilities expedite the drawing process.andP;  You canset up a grid of points spaced 1 foot apart and instruct the CADD software to&quot;snap&quot; the pointer to the nearest grid point.andP;  That makes short work oflaying down a series of precisely positioned parallel and perpendicularlines.andP;  Once the outline of the house is roughed in, you can refine the gridto one point every 4 inche and zoom in on each room to add finer detail.andP;  Andif a line is accidentally misplaced or drawn to the wrong length, you canerase it simply by clicking on it with the mouse or by instructing theprogram to trim the line back to its intersection with another line.andM;With the floor plan complete, you'll want to add some dimensions to show thesize of each room and the overall length and width of the house.andP;  This iswhere CADD really shines.andP;  It already knows the lengths and locations of thelines you've created, so when you select any two points, the CADD programcalculates the distance between them and displays it in the units and scaleyou specify.andP;  And thanks to a feature known as associative dimensioning(which permanently ties the dimension you just created to the two points youindicated), the dimension is automatically updated if you later return andstrech the line to add 3 feet to the length of the room.andM;As a final touch, you might add a few lines of text to indicate the squarefootage and the name of each room.andP;  CADD programs let you enter text in thestyle, size, and color of your choice; then you can paste it into thedrawing.andP;  Some CADD programs will even calculate the square feet for you.andO;You'd finish up by saving the final product to disk where it can be recalledfor editing later.andP;  As you become an experienced CADD user, you'll find thatyou're sending your sketch to be printed while the other guy is still tryingto pencil over his mistakes.andM;PUTTING CADD TO WORKandM;CADD programs are good for much more than generating house plans.andP;  We allknow that often a simple sketch is the best way to convey an idea, and CADDlets us put a picture in place of a thousand words.andP;  Now we can have the bestof both worlds, since word processors are being designed to incorporate CADDgraphics.andM;WordPerfect, Version 5.0, has done a particularly complete job of bridgingthe gap between traditional word processors and desktop publishers byoffering the ability to include graphics as well as text in word processingdocuments.andP;  Given a pictorial bitmap image stored on-disk, WordPerfect willbring it in, let you resize it and move it around, and wrap words around itin such a way that there's no collision between graphics and text.andP;  It evenincludes a small library of useful clip-art images to save you the time ofcoming up with them from scratch.andM;WhatWordPerfect doesn't give you is a way to create these images from withinitself.andP;  The program can, however, import files in a variety of graphicsformats and convert them into its own native .WPG (for WordPerfect Graphics)format.andP;  One of the formats it supports is known as .DXF, which is a neutralfile format developed by the makers of AutoCAD that is supported by most PCADD vendors.andP;  Hence, if you need a graphic for WordPerfect 5.0 and have aCADD system, you can draw your picture, save it as a .DXF file, and read itstraight into your WordPerfect document.andM;Many desktop publishing programs also support .DXF files.andP;  WordPerfect willeven import AutoCAD files directly, without intermediate translation to .DXF.andO;If you're involved with desktop publishing or graphics-oriented wordprocessing even in a small way, CADD is your ticket to attractive documentsand lively graphics.andM;CADD can help in other areas, too.andP;  How many times have you decided torear-range the furniture in your office and reached for a tape measure forhelp in matching potential arrangements to the size of your workspace?andP;  Maybeyou've even gone so far as to cut out paper models scaled to match the sizeof your desk, tables, and chairs, then toyed with different combinations oforientation and position.andP;  If so, you're a perfect candidate for CADD.andM;Most CADD programs will let you grab an object with the mouse pointer anddrag it around the screen.andP;  To take advantage of this in laying out an officearea, you'd simply set up a rectangle scaled to match the length and width ofthe room, then create another rectangle for each item of furniture.andP;  To keepthem straight, you might label each item with a simple line of text denotingits size and function.andP;  Then move them around at will.andP;  If two items won'tfit when placed end to end along a wall or wedged together in a corner,you'll see the overlap on the screen and save the useless labor of trying tomuscle the real pieces into position.andP;  And when you've found a satisfactoryarrangement, you can save it to disk for next time.andM;Another place where you might put CADD to work for you is in landscaping.andP;  Ifyou're like me, you like to work in the yard, planting trees and shrubs andadding touches of greenery to increase the visual appeal.andP;  But if you goabout it in a random, unplanned fashion, the results look haphazard.andP;  Ifthere's anything worse than spending an afternoon digging a hole for a treein dry, sun-baked earth, it's digging another hole for the same tree when itdoesn't look right where you first put it.andM;Landscaping calls for planning ahead.andP;  And a CADD program is perfect for thejob of preplanning and experimenting.andP;  CADD lets you play what-if withpictures the same way a spreadsheet lets you play what-if with financialdata.andP;  I have a CADD drawing file with the outline of my house, yard,driveway, sidewalks, and the street that borders my front yard sketched in.andO;When I begin a new landscaping project, I try out my ideas on the screenbefore investing a penny in materials or digging the first hole.andP;  If I don'tlike what I see on the screen, I tinker with it until I settle on asatisfactory scheme--or until I decide to scrap the idea altogether.andP;  Andwhen I do decide on a plan, I make sure to save it along with the masterdrawing file so that the changes are documented.andM;One of the many ways that CADD helps in such projects is by maintaining asymbol library.andP;  A symbol is a picture that can be inserted into a drawing asmany times in as many places as you like.andP;  Symbols save time when a number ofidentical objects are to be placed in a drawing.andP;  The CADD program lets youcreate the object once, save it as a symbol, and call it back whenever it'sneeded.andM;Thus, if you're working on a landscaping plan, for example, you mightconstruct a circle with lines emanating from the center, representing ashrub.andP;  You then save it as a symbol and simply paste it into the drawingwherever a shrub is needed.andP;  The same symbol can double as a tree if yousimply scale it up by a factor of 4 or 5 when you recall it from the library.andO;Most CADD programs will let you shrink, expand, and rotate a symbol prior toplacing it.andM;Most professional CADD users develop custom symbol libraries of their own.andO;An architect, for instance, will create a symbol library that includesobjects such as door swings, water closets, bathtubs, sinks, and windows.andO;After drawing each item once, he never has to draw it again unless he wantsto change it or make a new one that's a slight variation on the old.andM;Symbols needn't be limited to small objects.andP;  An entire drawing can beconverted into a symbol and pasted on top of another drawing.andP;  Thus, ifthere's a standard form you want to use on each of your drawings--such as aborder with your company's logo or letterhead--you can make a pattern out ofit by saving it as a symbol.andP;  Then each time you start a new drawing, you canretrieve the pattern from disk and add it to the new file.andM;BEYOND SYMBOLISMandM;The use of symbols isn't the only way that CADD lets you reduce the amount oftime spent duplicating geometric shapes.andP;  Any object or group of objects youdraw can be selectively mirrored, copied, or moved to another location.andO;Objects can also be duplicated in rectangular or circular arrays.andM;The classic example of how generating a circular array can save time is theconstruction of a gear.andP;  Each tooth of the gear is composed of identicallyconnected arcs and lines joined to the inner circle that forms thecircumference of the gear body.andP;  Creating each tooth individually in theproper orientation would be an enormous task.andP;  But with CADD, all you need todo is draw one-half of a tooth, mirror and copy it to make the adjoininghalf, then duplicate the resulting tooth in a circular array.andM;You can also set up a CADD drawing to serve as a visual database.andP;  Using aprocess known as attributing, information can be attached to individualobjects or symbols in a drawing and later extracted and transferred to anexternal ASCII file.andP;  There the information is typically used in a list ofmaterials or imported into a database program such as dBASE III or Paradox.andM;Consider, for example, the possibility of setting up a graphicalpoint-and-shoot database to store information about the members of yourstaff.andP;  You could start by sketching up a quick organization chart, with eachstaff member's name occupying a box.andP;  To each box you could add informationsuch as job title, years with the company, and area of expertise.andP;  Thisadditional information would be put in the form of unseen text attributes,which would be displayed only when you specifically asked for them.andP;  Withsome CADD programs, you could design your system so that clicking on a boxwould bring up a display of all recorded information for that person.andP;  Or youcould use the program's attribute extraction feature to generate a snapshotpersonnel profile of your entire organization.andM;3-D CADDandM;CADD isn't limited to producing two-dimensional pictures and drawings.andP;  Manyof the CADD programs available for the PC are capable of modeling objects infull 3-D.andP;  Each point on the object is assigned x, y, and z coordinates, andthe viewpoint representing the position of the operator's eye within theframe of the model can be shifted to show the object from any angle ordistance.andP;  A simple cube that looks like a square in a 2-D drawing takes onadded impact when viewed from a point in space that shows three of its sides.andM;But what really brings an object to life is its transformation from a simplewire-frame model to a lifelike shaded rendering.andP;  An object in wireframe formis represented only by the lines and curves that define its edges.andP;  Awireframe cube, for example, is composed of 12 lines, and all 12 can be seenfrom any viewing perspective.andP;  Without adding the ability to remove hiddenlines, there is no masking of the lines that lie behind surfaces positionedcloser to the eye.andP;  By contrast, a shaded rendering shows the surfaces thatmake up an object.andP;  Surfaces that are obscured by other surfaces are thushidden from view, and surfaces that are visible are shaded according to theintensity and relative position of an unseen light source.andM;Some CADD programs with shaded rendering capabilities even offer perspectiveviewing, in which all parallel lines converge at an infinite point on thehorizon.andP;  With perspective applied, an object loses the clinicaldrawing-board look and seemingly springs to life.andP;  In terms of visualrealism, shaded renderings drawn in perspective are the best that PC-basedCADD systems can currently offer.andP;  As recently as a few years ago, however,shaded images were beyond even many of the powerful mainframe computers.andO;Higher-performance computing engines and improved computer graphicsalgorithms have made shaded renderings possible at all cost levels.andM;Most rendering programs are sold separately from their parent CADD programs.andO;AutoShade, for example, is an add-on that accepts AutoCAD drawing files andproduces shaded renderings from them.andP;  Cadkey markets a Solids Synthesispackage that generates detailed shaded images from Cadkey drawing files.andM;If a simple 2-D sketch helps to get your point across, a 3-D shaded renderingwill really drive it home.andP;  The screen shot in Figure 1 illustrates a plainsketch of a floor plan generated in AutoCAD.andP;  Figure 2 shows the same plandisplayed as a 3-D wireframe in AutShade, with the lines defining the wallsextruded into surfaces.andP;  Figure 3 shows the entire scene displayed as ashaded rendering on an EGA video adapter.andM;The difference is clearly dramatic.andP;  The 3-D wireframe image makes it mucheasier to visualize what the final product--in this case the interior of ahouse--will actually look like.andP;  The shaded image helps even more.andP;  Givenadditional time, the model could be developed in much finer detail and evenembellished with doors, windows, and furniture.andP;  The only limit is yourimagination.andM;MORE-EFFICIENT CADDandM;After becoming acquainted with CADD program, there are a number of steps youcan take to make your work more efficient.andP;  CADD doesn't stop at helping youcreate drawings; it also helps you organize them and use the information inthem.andM;One of the ways CADD helps you organize your drawings is by implementing theconcept of layering.andP;  Imagine a drawing not as a single sheet of paper but asa vertical stack of clear cellophane pages.andP;  If you're developing plan-viewdrawings for a two-story house, you might draw the first floor on one page,the second floor on a second page, plumbing on a third, heating andair-conditioning ducts on a fourth, dimensions on a fifth, and notes on asixth.andP;  Stack them on top of each other, and you get a complete picture.andP;  Butpick any one page out of the stack and you get a clear, uncluttered view ofwhat's on it.andM;CADD drawings are structured the same way.andP;  When you work with CADD, you drawon one layer at a time and switch back and forth between layers to developthe drawing fully.andP;  The layer you're drawing on is known as the current, oractive, layer.andP;  CADD programs generally let you display one layer, alllayers, or any combination of layers at one time.andP;  Layering helps you keepthe discrete elements of your drawing separated without having to keep themin separate drawing files.andM;Figure 4 shows how one house plan was broken into layers in the early stagesof development.andP;  The first layer holds the outline of the walls, thesecond-layer symbols represent the swinging and sliding doors, and the thirdlayer adds the text that denotes the size and function of each room.andM;One of the quickest ways to increase your CADD productivity is to takeadvantage of macro capabilities the program offers.andP;  CADD macros are likethose commonly found in spreadsheets and word processors in that they let yourecord and play back sequences of keystrokes or pointer movements toeliminate needless manual repetition.andM;High-end CADD packages such as AutoCAD go even further and offer their ownprogramming languages.andP;  AutoLISP is a CADD-specific implementation of theLISP language that lets you customize AutoCAD by building your own programfiles, which are executed like commands.andP;  If you need a capability notalready built into AutoCAD--maybe a function to draw a box, or to draw twoparallel lines a certain distance apart with a single command--you can createit yourself and make it a part of the package.andP;  Working better and faster isworking smarter, and working smarter means increasing your productivity.andM;PORTABILITYandM;One of the problems you're likely to encounter if you deal frequently withCADD is that of transporting files produced by one system to another.andO;Unfortunately, all CADD programs currently on the market use proprietary fileformats.andP;  You can't, for example, create a drawing file with Generic CADD andthen read it directly into Cadkey or VersaCAD.andP;  Nor can you go the oppositedirection, sending a Cadkey or VersaCAD file to be interpreted by GenericCADD.andM;The solution is to use what are called &quot;neutral format&quot; files as a vehiclefor drawing exchange between systems.andP;  The economics behind the idea ofneutral files are easily demonstrated.andP;  If the vendors of six different CADDprograms had to supply translators that would enable them to import drawingfiles from each of the other five, a total of 30 different translators wouldhave to be written.andP;  If a new product came along, chances would be slim thatthe other vendors would rush to support it.andP;  But if all the CADD programspossessed the ability to read and write files in a common neutral format,then each would have an established link with the others.andP;  Then each vendorneed supply only a single translator that allows his system to go back andforth between its proprietary format and the agreed-upon neutral format.andM;There are currently two neutral file formats in widespread use: .DXF andIGES.andP;  .DXF and its ramifications have already been discussed in conjunctionwith WordPerfect 5.0.andP;  IGES, the acronym for Initial Graphics ExchangeSpecification, is a more encompassing standard established by the AmericanNational Standards Institute for the exchange of 2-D or 3-D drawing files.andO;IGES is almost universally supported by mainframe CADD vendors and enjoysgrowing support among PC-based CADD vendors.andM;To transport a drawing file from Cadkey to AutoCAD using the .DXF format, youwould simply call the drawing up in Cadkey, save it as a .DXF file, then gointo AutoCAD and read in the .DXF file.andP;  Theoretically, you would see thesame drawing in AutoCAD as you saw in Cadkey.andP;  In practice, you will have acertain amount of touching up to do.andP;  Regardless of their claims, differentCADD vendors support .DXF and IGES transfers to varying degrees.andP;  Moreover,there is an inevitable degree of mismatch between the entity or data types inthe respective formats.andP;  One CADD program may support eight different linetypes, for instance, while another supports only five.andP;  These inconsistenciesoften result in translation errors.andP;  But even if transfers are not fullyeffective, a 95 percent success rate is better than none at all.andM;NEW FRONTIERSandM;CADD is largely an outgrowth of advances in the wider field of computergraphics.andP;  As technology is further refined and hardware continues down thepath toward higher performance for less money, you can soon expect to seePC-based CADD systems that rival what runs today on $80,000 engineeringworkstations.andP;  The next move will be to true solid modeling, where partgeometry is represented as an unambiguous mathematical solid rather than byedges or surfaces.andP;  Real-time graphical simulations are not far away, either.andM;CADD is no longer restricted to use only by scientists and engineers.andP;  CADDprograms have flowed into the mainstream and are ready to be classed as&quot;commodity items,&quot; along with word processors, spreadsheets, and databaseprograms.andP;  The next time you need pictures, think about CADD.andP;  And when youthink about CADD, think of it as a means to an end, not as a prototypicaltool with little or no application beyond the boundaries of its scientificorigins.andM;SPEAKING THE CADD LANGUAGEandM;Like other specialized fields, the CADD (computer-aided drafting and design)world has developed its own terminology.andP;  Some of it was handed down from thedays when CADD ran only on mainframes and minicomputers; the rest of it wasadded after the technology was adapted to PCs.andP;  To help you learn somethingabout its phraseology, here's a short glossary of key CADD terms that willlet you hold your own when CADD buzzwords are being shot back and forth likeso many arrows.andM;Associative dimensioningandM;A feature that ties dimensions to specific pieces of geometry in such a waythat when the geometry is changed, the dimensions automatically change withit.andM;AttributeandM;Intrinsic information that may be attached to a drawn object for purposes ofdata storage and management.andP;  For example, a window on an architecturaldrawing might be attributed with the text string &quot;3 x 4&quot; to designate itsdimensions as 3 by 4 feet.andM;Through the process of attribute extraction, the information attached to thisand all other windows in the drawing can be gathered and written to an ASCIIfile.andP;  Once stored in an external file, the information is typically used ina list of materials or manipulated by a database program.andM;CADD (computer-aided drafting and design)andM;Also the name for an entire category of computerized drawing programs.andM;CAM (computer-aided manufacturing)andM;The technology by means of which manufacturing needs are fulfilled bycomputer.andP;  One example of a typical CAM application is using CADD systems toproduce the tapes needed to drive numerically controlled manufacturing andinspection machines.andM;CIM (computer-integrated manufacturing)andM;The integration of CADD and CAM to achieve the goal of completely automatingfactories.andM;Digitizing tabletandM;A peripheral input device (usually accompanied by an electronic pen or puckand menu overlays) that allows drawing operations to be selected andperformed off the screen rather than on it.andM;.DXF (drawing exchange file)andM;.DXF is a neutral file format developed by Autodesk, makers of AutoCAD, thatis suitable for the exchange of 2-D drawing files between CADD programs.andM;Hidden-line removalandM;The process of hiding lines on a wireframe model that would be obscured bysurfaces closer to the eye, thus producing the visual effect of a surface.andM;IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification)andM;IGES is a neutral file format established by the American National StandardsInstitute for the exchange of 2-D or 3-D drawing files.andM;LayeringandM;The act or method of dividing the elements of a single drawing among a numberof individual pages, or layers.andP;  This technique is widely used fororganizational purposes.andP;  Layers may be visualized as cellophane cells that,when stacked on top of one another, make up a complete picture of thedrawing.andM;PanningandM;The act of moving the window represented by the CRT screen around to viewdifferent portions of a drawing.andM;PlotterandM;A high-quality graphics output device consisting of a two-dimensionalmechanism that drives one or more colored pens across the surface of a sheetof paper to produce a rendering of what appears on a CRT screen.andM;Shaded renderingandM;A means of displaying an object in which surfaces are colored and shaded toproduce a visually realistic effect.andM;SnappingandM;A means of automatically selecting coordinating points when creating adrawing.andP;  For example, if endpoint snapping is activated, the user need onlyindicate a point anywhere on the line in order to select the endpoint of theline.andP;  The CADD program will automatically determine which end of the line iscloser and snap the screen cursor to it.andM;Solid modelingandM;A means of representing an object as an unambiguous mathematical solid ratherthan as a wireframe or surface model.andM;Surface modelingandM;A means of representing an object as a collection of bounding surfaces.andM;SymbolandM;A picture that can be inserted into a CADD drawing at the location, size, andangle of the user's choice.andP;  For example, a graphic depicting a window can bestored as a symbol and used in multiple instances on the elevation of ahouse.andP;  Symbols are also called blocks.andM;WireframeandM;A method of representing an object by showing only the lines and curves thatconstitute its edges.andP;  With this technique, the eye must supply its owninterpretation of the model to achieve the impression of surfacing.andM;CADD HARDWARE REQUIREMENTSandM;Many prospective users believe that setting a PC up for serious CADD workrequires megabytes of RAM, a hard disk, an expensive graphics card, a mathcoprocessor, a digitizing tablet, a plotter, and a souped-up 286 or 386machine running at 12 MHz or better.andM;'Tain't necessarily so.andP;  While outfitting your machine with all of the abovewill give you the most awesome CADD system on the block, not all these itemsare required to get up and running.andP;  Many CADD systems will run acceptablywith a plain old CGA video card or a Hercules monochrome card.andP;  An EGA hassufficient resolution to tackle all but the most complex designs.andP;  Megabytesof RAM can be great, but many CADD programs can't use anything beyond 640K.andM;Plotters are far too expensive to consider unless you're preparing forhigh-volume production work.andP;  A standard dot matrix or laser printer sufficesfor most purposes.andP;  A mouse is often as good as a digitizing tablet, and manyCADD programs even allow for input to come entirely from the keyboard.andM;And as for the 286 or 386 CPU--well, it helps, because CADD programs arenecessarily graphics-intensive, and graphics-intensive meanscomputation-intensive.andP;  But like most other products, CADD software will runon an 8086 or 8088, though with a commensurate sacrifice in speed.andM;The one item you shouldn't be without for CADD work is a numeric coprocessor.andO;CADD programs rely heavily on floating-point calculations and thus benefitdirectly from dedicated math hardware.andP;  AutoCAD is one of the few packagesthat require a coprocessor.andP;  If you opt to go without one, expect a tenfolddecrease in drawing performance.andP;  Circles that pop instantly into view with amath coprocessor installed are slowly painted on the screen a pixel at a timewithout one.andP;  There's a substantial penalty to be paid in productivity when adrawing takes 60 seconds to regenerate rather than 6.andM;I consider a minimal CADD hardware configuration to consist of a hard disk, agraphics card and a compatible monitor, a mouse, and a math coprocessor.andO;Some programs require a hard disk; others don't.andP;  An EGA and a relativelyfast machine are recommended but not required.andP;  Anything more should bejustified by the complexity of the task at hand or by heavy use, and anythingless may make CADD more of a hindrance than a help.andM;A BUYER'S GUIDE TO CADDandM;SOFTWARE FOR THE PCandM;There are two distinct classes of competitors in the race to bring high-powerCADD software to the PC: those costing roughly $500 and less, and thosecosting up to $3,000 and beyond.andP;  Among the lower-cost entrants belong suchimpressive performers as Generic CADD and Drafix 1 Plus, which give youmodest power and utility at a humble price.andP;  In the upper-price echelons,products like AutoCAD, Cadkey, MicroStation PC, and VersaCAD battle formarket share.andP;  While all are useful packages in their own right, they'retargeted more for the corporate user buying CADD software with companydollars than for the nontechnical user.andM;For home and business use, you're just about as well off with an inexpensiveCADD program if you buy carefully and match its features to what you want todo with the software.andP;  The under-$500 products generally perform as well astheir higher-priced counterparts but offer fewer features.andP;  That's fine ifyou have no desire for the built-in power of an AutoCAD or for its expandableAutoLISP programming capabilities, but don't expect a lowend product toaccommodate such refinements.andM;You'll find a thorough and useful suite of reviews of low-cost CADD packagesin the article &quot;Upwardly Mobile CADD,&quot; which appeared in the December 8,1987, issue of PC Magazine.andP;  High-end products were examined in PC Magazinein &quot;Expanding to New Dimensions,&quot; August 1988.andM;As in purchasing software of any type, it pays to look before you leap whenyou're ready to make the move to CADD.andM;THE CADD REVOLUTIONandM;The impact of computer-aided drafting and design on the fields ofarchitecture and engineering can be compared with the impact of theIndustrial Revolution on American industry.andP;  It has permanently changed theway we do business, so that a company that doesn't upgrade to take advantageof recent advances in computer technology is doomed to fall behind the restin terms of efficiency, productivity, and product quality.andP;  The rush is on asdesign houses make the transition from drafting board to computer screen andfactories both domestic and foreign race to implement the latest in CIM(computer-integrated manufacturing) technology.andM;In the old days, architecture and engineering organizations relied upon roomsfull of draftsmen bent diligently over drafting boards to produce blueprintsof their designs.andP;  Their primary tools were the T square, the triangle, andthe lead pencil.andP;  Look at what's around you--a building, the floor plan ofyour kitchen, the sheet metal box that houses your computer, or the desk thatstands in the corner of your den--and you'll notice that everything isprimarily composed of straight lines coming neatly together at very preciseangles.andM;Before any of these objects existed, they were carefully laid out on adrawing board.andP;  Chances are, the designs were changed--sent &quot;back to thedrawing board&quot;--many times before they were ready to be transferred from thedrawing board to the manufacturing floor.andP;  If you blow the dust off an olddrawing, you'll often see spots where the paper is almost worn through as aresult of so many erasures.andM;The same idea of crafting and recrafting a design is still followed today, ofcourse, but the drawing board is rapidly becoming as much a relic as theslide rule.andP;  With CADD, drawings are produced on the CRT screen in far lesstime than it would take on a drawing board.andP;  Changes are made much moreeasily and leave no messy eraser marks or smudged pencil lead.andP;  And drawingfiles are stored safely away on-disk, where they can be retrieved undamagedyears later and reproduced on paper with the aid of a plotter.andP;  Better still,drawings produced electronically can be zipped across the country in minutesover conventional telephone lines, eliminating the once costly andtime-consuming process of shipping paper drawings from one location toanother.andM;CADD even helps in the post-design phase.andP;  Some CADD systems can eliminatethe drudgery involved in analyzing a design by automatically calculating thearea of a floor plan or the mass centroid of a mechanical component.andP;  Outputneeded to drive a numerically controlled lathe or milling machine to shape apart from raw metal can be generated directly from the part model on-screen.andO;And concise material lists can be derived from a complicated assembly drawingsimply by invoking a data extraction feature similar to the reportingfunctions commonly found in database programs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
