Compositing (poolingsamples) for detection is discussed first, followed by the developmentof a statistical test to determine whether any component of a compositeexceeds a prescribed maximum acceptable level. Subsequently, the authorsexplore the question of optimal field sampling designs and present thefeatures of a microcomputer program designed to show the difficultiesin constructing efficient field designs and using compositing schemes.Finally, they propose the use of bioassays as an adjunct or replacementfor chemical analysis as a means of detecting and defining the arealextent of chemical migration.</TEXT></DOC>
