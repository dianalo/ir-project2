Afghanistan and Pakistan also signed the agreement in a solemnm10-minute ceremony in a marble and gold council chamber at U.N.headquarters. Pakistan was representing the Afghan guerrillas, whohave vowed to continue their war to oust the Marxist government inKabul.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who signed for the UnitedStates, said the agreement would allow the people of Afghanistan todetermine their own future and to restore the independence theyhave earned through ``blood and sacrifice.'' Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze signed for the Soviet Union.   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nationssaid the U.N.-mediated agreements ``represent a major stride in theeffort to bring peace to Afghanistan.''   Also signing the accord were Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil ofAfghanistan and Acting Foreign Minister Zain Noorani of Pakistan.   Shultz said the United States will continue to aid the Afghanguerrillas until the Soviets stop arming the Afghan government. Buthe also said the agreement will ``improve the atmosphere'' ofU.S.-Soviet relations and could help end Soviet intervention inother regional conflicts.   The settlement followed six years of on-again, off-againnegotiations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which neighborsAfghanistan and is home to an estimated 3 million Afghan refugees.   The Moslem insurgents fighting the Marxist Afghan government for10 years have headquarters in Pakistan. Pakistan also serves as theconduit for foreign military aid to the guerrillas.   Perez de Cuellar opened the 10-minute ceremony by thankingAfghanistan and Pakistan for their ``tireless efforts.'' He thankedthe United States, which supports the guerrillas, and the SovietUnion, which backs the government, for agreeing to guarantee theaccord.   Aides carried the leather-bound documents from one minister tothe next for signing. Copies go to each country and the UnitedNations.   The agreement commits Pakistan and Afghanistan to not support``directly or indirectly, rebellious or secessionist activities''against each other, and it provides from the withdrawal of Soviettroops who entered Afghanistan in 1979 to help the government.   Shultz said he was confident the Soviet Union would begin itstroop withdrawal on schedule May 15.   But in Pakistan, President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq said today heforesees continued turmoil in Afghanistan because the agreementdoesn't address the issue of a new government to replace the oneheaded by President Najib.   There is no provision in accord to end the war, and it saysnothing about the composition of future Afghan governments.   Pakistan said it would continue to withhold recognition of theKabul government pending formation of a new one. In a letter toDiego Cordovez, the U.N. mediator in the talks, Noorani said that``in view of the realities of the situation in Afghanistan andnotwithstanding the accords signed today, (Pakistan) will continueto ... withhold extending recognition to the regime in Kabul.''   The Afghan guerrillas have said they will continue their waruntil the government is deposed. No guerrilla leaders attended thesigning ceremony.   Shultz and Perez de Cuellar stressed that the accord will letthe Afghan people determine their fate.   ``The challenge facing the Afghan people is great, but it canand must be met by them alone,'' the secretary-general said.   ``Through their blood and sacrifice, the Afghans have earned theopportunity to resume their independence,'' Shultz said. ``Let ushelp them realize it.''   The United Nations estimates 1.5 million Afghans have beenkilled in the war, which began after an April 1978 communist coup.More than 10,000 Soviets have died in the fighting, Western sourcesestimate.   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told American businessleaders in Moscow on Wednesday that the accord may haveinternational implications on a par with the superpower treatysigned in December to ban medium-range nuclear missiles.   The Afghan agreement provides for withdrawal of all Soviettroops, pledges by Pakistan and Afghanistan of non-interference ineach other's affairs, and the safe return of about 5 millionrefugees from Pakistan and Iran. Moscow and Washington willguarantee Afghanistan's future non-alignment and the United Nationswill supervise the settlement, including the return of refugees.   Cordovez will continue promoting an intra-Afghan settlement byshuttling between the fighters and the government in Kabul.   Another point left out of the accord is military aid.   An informal understanding has been reported between the SovietUnion and United States. Diplomatic sources say each superpowerwill phase out such aid, while reserving the right to resume it ifthe other side does.</TEXT></DOC>
