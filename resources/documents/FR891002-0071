Background</ITAG>The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law No. 94-163(42U.S.C. 6201 <T3>et seq.</T3>), December 22, 1975, declared it to be U.S. policy toestablish a national Strategic Petroleum Reserve of up to one billion barrelsof petroleum. The Government's currently stated commitment is to completea 750 million barrel reserve, although the Congress has directed that abillion barrel goal be assumed for certain analytical purposes, and theDepartment of Energy recently submitted a technical report on a one billionbarrel reserve to Congress.The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is located in salt domes at six sites onthe U.S. Gulf Coast, where the currently projected storage goal is 750million barrels of crude oil. The first shipment of crude oil was receivedin July 1977. There now are over 570 million barrels of crude oil in theseStrategic Petroleum Reserve storage facilities.Past funding for Strategic Petroleum Reserve facilities and oil has comeprimarily from direct Congressional appropriations. The Federal Governmenthas obtained sites from private owners, exercising its power of eminentdomain. Oil for the Reserve has been purchased on the open market and throughgovernment-to-government contracts. Total SPR appropriations for oil andfacilities through Fiscal Year 1989 have been $19 billion, of which 83percent has been for oil acquisition and transport, and the remainder hasbeen for storage facility development and operations and program management.The Government's commitment to 750 million barrels of oil could cost asmuch as $25 billion by 1995, with roughly 20 percent of costs being forstorage facilities and management and 80 percent for crude oil.Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil purchases and facilities development arecurrently funded on-budget through Congressional appropriations. They countagainst the Federal budget deficit under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings procedures.Funding levels for Fiscal Year 1990, which begins on October 1, 1989, havenot yet been determined.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose of Inquiry</ITAG>The Department of Energy has long been interested in alternative methodsof financing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; that is, in methods otherthan the direct appropriation and outlay approach which has been utilizedin SPR oil and facility acquisition up to this point in time. The Departmentis interested in alternatives that would reduce the cost to the FederalGovernment of developing the Reserve or at least reduce the Government'sactual outlays in early years without appreciably increasing the finaltotal cost of the Reserve.The Deparment is well aware that there is interest in alternative financingproposals in the oil industry and the banking and financial community.The Department has received numerous unsolicited proposals in recent yearsand some of these proposals have been the subject of informal meetings.The Congress also is interested in alternative financing methods. Congress,in recently extending title I of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act,required the Secretary of Energy to study alternative financing methodsthat could be used to finance completion of a 1 billion barrel StrategicPetroleum Reserve. Specifically, Public Law No. 101-46 sets out the followingrequirements:<ITAG tagnum="73">Sec. 2. Study and Report on Oil Leasing and Other Arrangements toFill SPR to One Billion Barrels.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) <T3>In General._</T3>The Secretary of Energy shall carry out a study onpotential financial arrangements (including long-term leasing of crudeoil and storage facilities) that could be used to provide additional, alternativemeans of financing the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to onebillion barrels. In carrying out such study, the Secretary shall_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Assume that the legislation that extends title I of the EnergyPolicy and Conservation Act beyond April 1, 1990, will require the Secretaryto amend, by July 1, 1990, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan to provideplans for completion of storage of one billion barrels of petroleum productsin the Reserve at an average fill rate of at least seventy-five thousandbarrels per day;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Consider a broad array of such arrangements;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Consult with persons in the private sector who might be interestedin leasing crude oil or storage facilities;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Initiate, in cooperation with the Department of State, to theextent consistent with the interests of the United States, discussionswith representatives of foreign governments and other entities as to thetypes of financial arrangements (including crude oil leasing arrangements)that would interest them; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Produce preliminary written solicitations for proposed alternativefinancial arrangements (including long-term leasing of crude oil and storagefacilities) to assist in filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to onebillion barrels.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Reports_</T3>(1) The Secretary shall, no later than October 15, 1989,transmit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senateand the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representativesan interim report containing_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) An enumeration of the specific resources (both personnel and funding)committed to the study described in subsection (a);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) A description of the progress made toward completing the study;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) Any preliminary findings and conclusions made by such date.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The Secretary shall, no later than February 1, 1990, transmitto such committees a copy of the solicitations described in paragraph (5)of subsection (a) and a final report containing the findings and conclusionsof the study carried out under this section, together with a draft of thelegislative changes that would be necessary to authorize the most significantalternative financial arrangements studied by the Secretary (includinglong-term leasing of crude oil and storage facilities) and recommendationsof the Secretary with respect to the need for and desirability of suchfinancial arrangements (including long-term leasing of crude oil and storagefacilities).</ITAG>The purpose of this inquiry is to obtain assistance in fulfilling theselegislative requirements. Both Congress and the Department of Energy areinterested in alternative financing methods that could reduce the impacton the Federal deficit of developing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Tothat end, the Department is interested in methods that could be used tofinance any additional development of the Reserve above the more than 570million barrels of crude oil currently in storage, either to a level of750 million barrels or to a level of one billion barrels.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Alternative Methods of Financing the Development of the StrategicPetroleum Reserve</ITAG>There are a wide range of possible alternative methods for financing theStrategic Petroleum Reserve. As noted above, most prior financing of theStrategic Petroleum Reserve has been through direct appropriations by theCongress. Exceptions included use of Naval Petroleum Reserve sales revenuesto finance Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil purchases in Fiscal Year 1987,use of special ``entitlements'' provisions to augment direct appropriationsin Fiscal Year 1981, and use of the profits from the Strategic PetroleumReserve test sale in late 1986.The Department wishes to invite comments on all possible alternative financingmethods for completing the development of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Suggestions may concern the financing of storage facilities, of oil tobe stored in the reserve, or both. Suggestions may be approaches permittedunder current legislation, or they may be of a nature requiring additionallegislation. Suggestions should be in as much detail as possible. The purposeof this Notice of Inquiry is to gather information and insights about theoptions.The following list, which is not intended to be all-inclusive, illustratespossible alternative financing approaches. It is provided merely to showinterested parties the range of methods that might be of interest to theGovernment:andbullet; Leases of oil;andbullet; Leases of facilities;andbullet; Bonds, other than conventional debt issued by the Treasury;andbullet; SPR user charge linked to oil imports or consumption;andbullet; Exchange of Federal assets for oil and/or storage facilities;andbullet; Non-Federal public financing of state or regional petroleum reserves;andbullet; Cancellation of government or private debt of foreign oil producersin return for oil;andbullet; Sale of rights to acquire Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil duringa disruption.In reviewing alternatives, the Department will consider the following factors,among others:andbullet; Effects on Strategic Petroleum Reserve costs under a broad rangeof plausible future energy conditions;andbullet; Budget effects;andbullet; Effects on Strategic Petroleum Reserve development schedules;andbullet; Impacts on the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during asevere energy supply interruption;andbullet; Incentives created for foreign producer governments;andbullet; Effects on energy markets;andbullet; Incentives and disincentives for other parties to provide a reasonabledegree of self-protection against the effects of a severe energy supplydisruption;andbullet; Complexity and administrative burdens.<ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Request for Written Comments and Submission of Ideas for AlternativeMethods of Financing the Development of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve</ITAG>The Department of Energy hereby requests that interested parties submitideas for or comments on the subject of alternative financing methods forfurther developing and filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Five copiesof each submission should be received by the Department by October 20,1989. The proper address and other pertinent information are listed nearthe beginning of this notice.Submissions believed to be ``proprietary'' should be identified as such.However, the decision that a financing method actually is proprietary isone that the Department reserves the right to make in light of all factsand circumstances. Submitters should be aware that a wide range of alternativefinancing concepts already have been considered by the Department overan extended period of time. The Department is charged with providing apublic policy analysis to the Congress on this subject and may not be ableto give full consideration to concepts which cannot be discussed openly.Potential respondents should be aware, furthermore, that should the Departmentrequest proposals for an alternative financing method or methods in thefuture, a competitive government solicitation may be used.<ITAG tagnum="6">Michael R.
