An emergency situation,in the form of a recently documented outbreak of a virulent desert tortoiseupper respiratory disease syndrome (Respiratory Disease Syndrome), hasbeen identified and has caused significant declines to certain tortoisesubpopulations and threatens to become pandemic in subpopulations alreadystressed as a result of habitat degradation, predation, and other factors.Because of the need to make Federal funding, protection, and other measuresimmediately available to combat the Respiratory Disease Syndrome, the Servicefinds that good cause exists to make this emergency rule effective uponpublication. The emergency rule will implement Federal protection for 240days. The status of the Beaver Dam Slope desert tortoises, which were listedas threatened with critical habitat in 1980, will not change. The Servicedoes not expect additional benefits would accrue to this subpopulationby changing its listing to endangered at this time. A proposed rule tolist the Mojave population of the desert tortoise will be published shortlyto provide for public comment, and hearings (if requested). The Servicewill accept comments on the status of the species at any time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATES: </T2>This emergency rule is effective on August 4,1989 and expires on April 2, 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The complete file for this rule is available for inspectionduring normal business hours at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, RegionalOffice, Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservation, 1002 NEHolladay Street, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Robert P.

The Berlandier's tortoise(<T3>G. berlandieri</T3>) is found in northeastern Mexico and southern Texas.The gopher tortoise (<T3>G. polyphemus</T3>) is found in the hot, humid portions of southeasternUnited States. <T3>G. agassizii</T3> is relatively large, with adults measuring up to15 inches in shell length and inhabits the Mojave, Colorado, and Sonorandeserts in the southwestern United States and adjacent Mexico.Recent studies based on shell shape and variations in genetic compositionindicate that the species has two distinct populations, one of which isdivided into two subpopulations (Spang et al. 1988). A summary of thisinformation is as follows:The two populations are the Mojave and the Sonoran. These are separatedin the U.S. and Mexico by the Colorado River, with the former populationsbeing found to the west and north of the river and the latter being foundto the east and south. The Mojave population is further divided into twosubpopulations.The western Mojave subpopulation includes parts of the west Mojave, eastMojave, and Colorado Deserts in California and extreme southern Nevada.Tortoises occur in creosote bush, alkali sink, and tree yucca habitatsin valleys, on alluvial fans, and in low rolling hills at elevations generallyranging from 2,000 to 4,000 feet above sea level. Study plot data fromeight sites indicate that populations have declined at rates of 10 percentor more per year for the last six to eight years. Vandalism, collections,raven predation, and disease are a few of the many causes for populationdeclines. Habitat is deteriorating and being lost from urban, energy, andmineral development, vehicle-oriented recreation, grazing, and other uses.The eastern Mojave subpopulation includes tortoises in eastern California,southern Nevada, and the Beaver Dam Slope and the Virgin River Basin ofsouthwestern Utah and extreme northwestern Arizona (north of the GrandCanyon). For the purposes of this rule, the status of Beaver Dam slopetortoises will remain unchanged. Eastern Mojave tortoises occur in creosotebush-burro bush or creosote bush-tree yucca vegetation types. Downwardtrends in this subpopulation and its habitat are believed to be a resultof urban development, long-term livestock grazing, mining, large-scalewater development, off-road vehicle use, collecting, and many other human-relateduses.The Sonoran population is found in Arizona, south and east of the ColoradoRiver, and in Mexico. Tortoises in this area are found on steep, rockyslopes of mountain ranges, primarily in Arizona upland vegetation dominatedby palo verde and saguaro cactus. The distribution of the present populationand habitat is disjunct. Some habitat has been lost to expansion of urbanareas. Grazing, mining, and fire have adversely affected some areas oftortoise habitat.The Beaver Dam Slope population of desert tortoises in Utah was listedas threatened with critical habitat on August 20, 1980 (45 FR 55654). TheService received a petition on September 14, 1984, from the EnvironmentalDefense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Defenders of Wildlifeto list the desert tortoise in Arizona, California, and Nevada as endangeredunder the Endangered Species Act. The Service determined in September 1985that the proposed listing of the tortoise within the three petitioned Stateswas warranted but precluded by other listing actions of higher priorityunder authority of section 4(b)(3)(iii) of the Act. Annual findings ofwarranted but precluded have been made in each subsequent year since 1985under authority of section 4(b)(3)(C) of the Act. For the purpose of this rule, the Mojave population of the desert tortoiseincludes all desert tortoises north and west of the Colorado River, includingdesert tortoises in the Colorado and Mojave Deserts of California, southernNevada, southwestern Utah, and northwestern Arizona, other than the BeaverDam Slope population of desert tortoises, which is already listed as athreatened species under the Act. Data collected on the Mojave population in recent months indicate thatmany local tortoise populations throughout the range of the species havedeclined precipitously. The rapid spread of Respiratory Disease Syndrome,rarely seen before in wild tortoises, has been identified as a significantcontributing factor in the current high level of tortoise losses.On May 31, 1989, the same three environmental organizations that petitionedthe Service in 1984 petitioned the Service to list the desert tortoiseas an endangered species throughout its United States range under the expeditedemergency provisions of the Act. This petition was received on June 2,1989. In response to this petition, the Service conducted an extensivereview of existing information on the Respiratory Disease Syndrome, otherreported diseases in Arizona, and tortoise status. As a result of thisand other information, the Service determines the Mojave population ofthe desert tortoise to be an endangered species. The Service will not takeemergency action to reclassify the Beaver Dam Slope population in Utahto endangered because it is already protected by the Act. The Service doesnot concur with the requested action under the petition to emergency listthe Sonoran population of desert tortoises. The rationale leading to thisdecision is as follows:1. Historically, desert tortoises in the Sonoran population occur in numeroussmall groups, more or less patchy or disjunct, inhabiting steep-sided canyons.2. The very patchiness of the distribution in the Sonoran population leadsthe Service to believe that the Respiratory Disease Syndrome affectingother subpopulations will not likely reach the epidemic proportions thatit has in locations like the Desert Tortoise Natural Area in California.Although a few instances of a respiratory disease have been documentedin the Sonoran population and are of concern to the Service, it appearsthat respiratory disease is: (a) Usually present in tortoise populationsto varying degrees, (b) has not shown any evidence of becoming pandemic,(c) has not been shown to be Respiratory Disease Syndrome, and (d) is currentlybeing addressed by the Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department,who will continue to gather and evaluate data. A report on the resultsof these studies will be available after two field seasons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that the Mojave population of the desert tortoiseshould be classified as endangered. A species may be determined to be endangeredor threatened due to one or more of the five factors described in section4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Mojave population ofdesert tortoise are as follows:A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof its Habitat or RangeAs indicated above, habitat is deteriorating and has been lost due to anaccelerating rate of urban, energy, and mineral development, military activities,vehicle-oriented recreational activities, grazing, and land exchanges.Changes in perennial vegetation, essentially the reduction in cover ofsmall and large shrubs and perennial grasses, are believed to be the resultof cattle and sheep grazing pressures. These changes have created openingsand barren areas in desert landscape and have deteriorated the qualityof habitat for the tortoise. Losses of plant cover may contribute to theexcessive raven predation on small tortoises being recorded. Changes inannual vegetation have also affected food supplies for tortoises. Weedyplant species that have been introduced for grazing can germinate, flower,and fruit before the native plants. Native plant species are essentialto meet the nutritional needs of the tortoise and are their favored forage.The exotic weedy species are outcompeting many native plant species (Berry1988). Additional potential adverse impacts to the tortoise from cattleand sheep grazing include: damage to shrubs used for tortoise shelter,crushing of burrows and nests, and trampling of young tortoises. Cattlegrazing has contributed to declines in many tortoise populations. The degreeand nature of impacts from cattle grazing is dependent upon habitat, grazinghistory, seasons of use, stocking rates, and density of the tortoise population(Sievers et al. 1988).The following discussions are summarized from Alden Sievers and the CaliforniaDesert Tortoise Workgroup's 1988 Recommendations for Management of theDesert Tortoise in the California Desert, submitted to the Bureau of LandManagement (BLM), Riverside, California, and to the California Departmentof Fish and Game, Long Beach, California (Sievers et al. 1988):Vehicle free-play in tortoise habitat results in cumulative adverse impactto tortoise habitat. Impacts vary from minor habitat alteration and vehicleroute proliferation to total denudation of extensive areas created by intensivevehicle play, parking, and camping. Concentrated vehicle play areas mayeliminate all but the most hardy shrubs. Other impacts include soil compactionand erosion. Tortoises suffer from loss of forage, loss of vegetative cover,and loss of burrow sites and then become subject to increased mortalityfrom crushing, collection, and vandalism.Competitive off-highway vehicle racing events adversely impact tortoisehabitat. They usually involve several hundred race participants and thousandsof spectators. The camping and race start and finish areas receive intensivevehicle use and become devoid of vegetation. Tortoises are eliminated fromthese areas entirely due to the loss of food, cover, and burrow sites.Affected areas become enlarged with continued use.Vehicle route proliferation has occurred in many areas and can result ina significant cumulative loss of habitat. Human access increases the incidenceof tortoise mortality from collection, gunshot, and crushing by vehicles.Soil compaction results in loss of vegetation and increases in erosion.Large surface disturbances (e.g., power plants, mining, agricultural developments,military activities, and urbanization) cause longterm, permanent loss ofhabitat. Both large and small developmental activities often induce furthersurface disturbing activities with resulting habitat loss and tortoisepopulation reduction. Increased human activity results in increased vehiclekills, vandalism, and collecting of tortoises.Land exchanges may result in habitat loss and increased fragmentation ofpopulations. Even where tortoise habitat is exchanged by the Bureau ofLand Management for other tortoise habitat, there is an increased likelihoodof development, resulting in loss of habitat, on the new private holdings.B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationalPurposesDesert tortoises have long been a popular pet in the Southwest. It is notcurrently known to what extent collecting has impacted wild populations.It is estimated that 100,000 desert tortoises exist in captivity. Manytortoises held in captivity, however, are known to exhibit signs of contagiousRespiratory Disease Syndrome. The release of diseased captive tortoisesis considered by the BLM to be the source of introduction of the currentlyidentified Respiratory Disease Syndrome found in wild populations. Therelease of captive tortoises to the wild population following listing asEndangered could be considered to constitute harm to the wild population.C. Disease of PredationPredation of young tortoises by ravens is a growing threat to the species.Common raven populations in the southwestern deserts have increased significantlysince the early 1940's, presumably in response to expanding human use ofthe desert. Sewage ponds, landfills, power lines, roads, and other useshave increased available foraging, roosting, and nesting opportunitiesfor ravens. In recent years, raven predation on juvenile desert tortoiseshas increased to a point where recruitment of young tortoises into theadult population has been significantly reduced or eliminated in certainlocalities. Ravens are highly adaptable as to their feeding patterns, andconcentrate on easily available seasonal food sources such as juveniletortoises, including live, healthy animals. In the Desert Tortoise NaturalArea, a protected area of 21,320 acres in the western Mojave Desert, eventhough tortoise eggs are still being laid and hatched, as shown by thepresence of very small tortoises, raven predation appears to have preventedthe recruitment of the young into the adult population (BLM 1989).The BLM's 1989 Environmental Assessment (BLM 1989) for the Selected Controlof the Common Raven to Reduce Desert Tortoise Predation in the Mojave Desert,California, further summarizes the annual trend (percent annual change)and the change (percent) of raven numbers in the last 20 years for thefollowing deserts:In the Mojave Desert, raven populations have increased 15-fold between1968 and 1988, at a rate of nearly 15 percent per year.A new threat to certain desert tortoise populations has recently been identified.A fatal disease, currently referred to as Desert Tortoise Respiratory DiseaseSyndrome, is spreading and appears to target the mature, reproductivelyactive segment of the population.The disease has been known for some time in captive tortoises throughoutthe world (Shipes et al. 1980), although the exact cause, or etiologicalagent, has not been clearly identified. The disease is probably the resultof multiple factors working in concert. It is known that the disease maybe readily transmitted from an infected tortoise to a non-infected tortoise(Rosskopf 1988). A virus (herpes-like) has been observed by electron microscopicstudies in other species of turtles with respiratory tract infections (Jacobsonet al. 1986). A paramyxovirus is also considered as a primary pathogencapable of initiating the disease (Jacobson, personal communication, inRosskopf 1988). Infected animals may not necessarily exhibit obvious signsof the disease.Once the disease is initiated, bacteria may invade and become the primarypathological agent. <T3>Pasturella testudinatus </T3>was recently isolated from a series ofsick tortoises collected for disease study from the Desert Tortoise NaturalArea in California. Species of <T3>Pasturella </T3>Bacteria are commonly associated with disease syndromesinitiated or enhanced by other predisposing factors, including poor nutrition,stress, and immune system compromise.The disease appears to be spread via contact between infected and non-infectedanimals (Rosskopf 1988). Adult male tortoises may contact many femalesin a single breeding season and, thus, the occurrence of the disease inthe adult breeding population would reinforce the conclusion that directnose contact during courtship activities could spread the pathogen to susceptibletortoises. Once the disease is contracted, there appears to be little chanceof full recovery and the affected individual eventually becomes debilitatedand dies. Even individuals given extensive treatment in captivity usuallysuccumb to the disease eventually. Furthermore, if an inidividual appearsto overcome the disease, relapse may occur under stress conditions (Rosskopf1988).Although the transmittance of an infectious agent from one tortoise toanother occurs by contact, the actual infection of the newly inoculatedindividual may be associated with other factors that increase its susceptibility.Some of the original information published about this disease suggesteda nutritional and/or stress-related cause with a secondary bacterial infectionof debilitated animals (Fowler 1977). The combination of an infectiousagent along with lowered resistance is typical of these types of diseasesyndromes in many other animals.Based on current knowledge of the incidence, morbidity, and the mortalityrates, the disease appears to be escalating in surveyed populations inthe western Mojave Desert. The disease was first recognized as a majorproblem in wild populations in the spring of 1988 (Fauna West WildlifeConsultants 1989). Signs of the disease were observed in up to 46 percentof adult tortoises examined during surveys of the Desert Tortoise NaturalArea in the western Mojave Desert in southern California in the springof 1988. In one portion of this range, the infection rate went from 9 percentin a 1988 survey to 52 percent of all tortoises in a 1989 survey. A lossof about 20 percent of the marked tortoise population with disease signsoccurred in one year in this plot.While not all populations surveyed have such high mortality rates, thesefigures demonstrate the potential impact the disease can have on any givenarea. Infection rates in multiple grid areas in the southern Californiastudy area range from 7 to 50 percent. The disease symptoms have also beenobserved in individual tortoises from a variety of populations (Berry 1989)including the Fremont Valley (50 percent infection rate), Saguaro NationalMonument in Arizona (2 of 12 radio tagged infected, and died), and BeaverDam Slope, Utah-Arizona (10 to 20 percent infection rate with high mortalityin radio tagged animals). Interviews of personnel at veterinary hospitalsin the Las Vegas, Nevada area by Service personnel have revealed that mostcases of Respiratory Disease Syndrome are found in captive tortoises, butthat wild tortoises have been brought in with symptoms of respiratory disease.The potential exists for the Respiratory Disease Syndrome to reach epidemicproportions throughout the Mojave population. There appear to be no naturalbarriers that would prevent transfer of infectious agents from Californiasubpopulations to Nevada, Utah, and Arizona subpopulations in the Mojavedesert. In addition to the identified respiratory disease in the BeaverDam Slope population, an apparent nutritional disease causing osteoporosisof the bones has been identified (Jarchow 1988). D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms All four involved States have laws that provide varying levels of protectionfor the desert tortoise. State of Nevada laws concerning fish, game, and watercraft, as amendedin 1987, afford limited protection in the desert tortoise. Nevada RevisedStatutes (NRS), Section 501.110.1(d) sets forth that reptiles must be classifiedas either protected or unprotected. NRS Section 501.110.2 states that protectedwildlife may be further classified as either sensitive, threatened, orendangered. The Nevada Administrative Code (NAC), Section 503.080.1(a)classifies the desert tortoise as protected and rare outside the urbanareas of Clark County (Las Vegas). NRS Section 503.597, states that itis unlawful, unless with written consent of the Nevada Department of Wildlife,to transport a desert tortoise from one portion to another portion of theState or across State lines. The California Fish and Game Commission adopted a regulation change onJune 22, 1989, to amend the California Code of Regulations, Section 670.5(b)(4)of Title 14, to add the desert tortoise as a State threatened species.Under the Fish and Game Code, Article 3, Section 2080 prohibits the importor export of endangered or threatened species. This section also indicatesthat no person shall take, possess, purchase, or sell within the State,any listed species, or any part or product thereof, except as otherwiseprovided in State law or regulation. Violations of these provisions relatingto endangered species may result in both fines (up to $5,000.) and/or imprisonment(up to one year). The California Fish and Game Code, Article 4, Section 2090 requires thateach State agency shall consult with the California Department of Fishand Game to ensure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out bythat State lead agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existenceof any State listed species. In Arizona, the collecting season has been closed on the desert tortoisesince January 1, 1988, under Arizona Game and Fish Commission Order 43:Reptiles. Under Arizona Administrative Code, Title 12, Chapter 4, Article319.3, the desert tortoise is considered ``prohibited wildlife'' and maynot be imported, exported, possessed, transported, propagated, purchased,bartered, sold, leased, or offered for sale except as expressly authorizedby State law.In Utah, the status of the desert tortoise is considered by the State tobe endangered (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 1987). The desert tortoiseis also considered a ``prohibited reptile'' under Utah Rule, Collection,Importation, Transportation and Subsequent Possession of Zoological Animals(R608-3). In Utah, the desert tortoise is prohibited from collection, importation,transportation, possession, sale, transfer, or release.E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued ExistenceVandalism, including shooting and crushing of tortoises under vehicles,has been documented by the Bureau of Land Management (Bureau) and is considereda factor in reducing the number of tortoises in their natural habitat.Bureau studies on 11 permanent study plots showed 14.3 percent of the carcasseswith evidence of gunshot. The highest incidence of gunshot is found inthe western Mojave Desert. At one plot, the highest frequency of carcasseswith evidence of gunshot was 28.9 percent (Sievers et al. 1988).<ITAG tagnum="85">Status of Feral Tortoises and Tortoises Currently Held in Captivity</ITAG>Feral desert tortoises, which have been released inside the native habitatof the desert tortoise, are classified endangered species in the area northand west of the Colorado River and are protected under the Act. Tortoisesfound released outside of the known Mojave population range will be consideredas captive animals.Under section 9(b)(1) of the Act, prohibitions applicable to the Mojavepopulation will not apply to tortoises that were held in captivity or ina controlled environment on the date of the publication of this notice,provided, that such holding and any subsequent holding or use of the tortoisewas not in the course of a commercial activity.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at thetime a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that critical habitat for this population is not determinable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withStates, and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing.Such increased recognition and an active recovery program would providea means to ensure survival for the desert tortoise. Available funding wouldbe used on research to determine the causes of and possible treatmentsfor the disease currently infecting tortoise populations and to determinewhether the disease can be passed on to hatchlings by infected females.Available funding would also be used for, but would not necessarily belimited to, the identification of and isolation of healthy populations,carrying out raven control to reduce loss of immature tortoises, and publiceducation to discourage further releases of diseased captive tortoises.The protection required of Federal agencies and the applicable prohibitionsare discussed, in part, below:Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.Over 63 percent of occupied desert tortoise habitat is managed by the BLM.Other Federal Managers of tortoise habitat include the Department of Defense,National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and lands managed byIndian tribes. All current and proposed actions and plans for managementof the habitat will require considerations for the protection of the tortoise,as required by the Act. Such activities may include, but may not be limitedto, grazing, off-highway-vehicle use, mining, construction of developmentsand rights-of-way, and activities in tortoise habitat that kill tortoisesand fragment their habitat.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set fortha series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import or export, shipin interstate commerce in the course of a commercial activity, or sellor offer for sale any desert tortoise in interstate or foreign commerce.It is also illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or shipany such wildlife that has been illegally taken. Certain exceptions applyto agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife under certain circumstances. Regulations governingsuch permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are availablefor scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of thespecies, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawfulactivities. In some instances, permits may be issued during a specifiedperiod of time to relieve undue economic hardship that would be sufferedif such relief were not available.All <T3>Gopherus </T3>tortoises, including the desert tortoise, were listedon July 1, 1975, as Appendix II species under the Convention on InternationalTrade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The only exceptionwithin the genus is <T3>G. flavomarginatus, </T3> which was listed as an Appendix I species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Determination</ITAG>Under section 4(b)(7) of the Act and 50 CFR 424.20, the Secretary may determinea species to be endangered or threatened by an emergency rule that shallcease 240 days following publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The reasons for taking this action with respectto the desert tortoise are discussed below. If at any time after this rulehas been issued, the Secretary determines that substantial evidence doesnot exist to warrant such a rule, it shall be withdrawn.As noted above, an emergency posing a significant risk to the well-beingof the desert tortoise exists as a result of the outbreak and rampant spreadof a contagious disease that is often, and may always be, fatal and forwhich no known cure currently exists. Even before the recent outbreak ofa virulent respiratory disease, the desert tortoise was in serious perilfor the many reasons already noted.In 1985, when the Service found that the listing of the remaining populationsof the desert tortoise as endangered was warranted, disease was not knownto be a major factor affecting the species' survival. Today, however, ahighly contagious and often fatal Respiratory Disease Syndrome is knownto exist in tortoise populations in California, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada.Tortoises in some of these areas have experienced extraordinary populationcollapses within the very recent past and infection rates of survivinganimals often exceed 50 percent. The outbreak of this disease syndrome,particularly when viewed against the background of the many other seriousfactors detrimentally affecting wild tortoise populations, poses a significantrisk to the immediate well-being and survival of the species.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not beprepared in connection with listing species under the Endangered SpeciesAct of 1973, as amended.<ITAG tagnum="74">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Berry, K.H. 1988.
