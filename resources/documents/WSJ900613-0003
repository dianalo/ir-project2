E.T.S. to Offer   Employee Tests   ----   By Gilbert Fuchsberg   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/13/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><CO>   OLS LABOR</CO><IN>SOFTWARE (SOF)</IN><LP>   The people who run the College Board exams want to putoffice workers to the test.   Educational Testing Service, publisher of the ScholasticAptitude Test and other educational and professional exams,is developing a series of products that would assess basicworkplace skills, from computer know-how to secretarial savvyto memo-writing ability.</LP><TEXT>   Today the Princeton, N.J., company is to announce itsfirst products for the office-testing field, a series ofsoftware packages to probe proficiency on a variety ofword-processing programs used in millions of businessesaround the country. Tests for less concrete skills are stillin the developmental stage.   If they catch on, the new E.T.S. tests -- billed by aspokeswoman as the &quot;S.A.T.s&quot; of the workplace -- could prompta shake-up in the burgeoning employee evaluation industry.E.T.S.'s prominence as the nation's best-known testingcompany stands to give its workplace tests added credibility.This could encourage the spread of employee testing,especially among employers concerned about liability foradministering tests that are deemed unfair, experts say.   Companies now can sort among thousands of testing productsand techniques, from written personality and integrity teststo computer-based simulations of corporate dilemmas. A recentFord Foundation study charged that much workplace testing hasgrown out of control, with little regulation existing toverify test validity and to ensure that tests aren't biasedin themselves or misused by companies.   E.T.S. hasn't escaped criticism. Some educators say thecompany hasn't done enough to discourage colleges from usingits tests as the sole standard to judge applicants. And thecompany's new workplace tests could be abused becauseemployers will be free to buy and administer them withoutsupervision.   But E.T.S.'s reputation is bound to give it a strategicedge. One possible result, observers say, could be the firstnationally accepted benchmarks for judging secretaries,clerks and other entry-level workers, a group assailed bymany employers for lacking basic qualifications.   &quot;E.T.S.'s entry into this kind of testing will clearly addvalue and credibility,&quot; says Walter M. Haney, a seniorresearch associate with Boston College's Center for the Studyof Testing, Evaluation and Educational Policy.   E.T.S. itself isn't shy about heralding its impact. Thename &quot;is like a Good Housekeeping seal of approval,&quot; aspokesman says.   The company is &quot;not looking to make bundles and bundles ofmoney in the short run&quot; with workplace testing, says AliceIrby, an E.T.S. vice president overseeing the venture. E.T.S.revenue, which has increased steadily for the past fiveyears, reached $256 million in the year ending June 30, 1989.   But E.T.S. faces troubles in its largest longtime market:college admissions testing. A decline in the population ofhigh school seniors caused a modest slide in the S.A.T.business last year, to just under two million testsadministered. And if demographic projections hold, demand maydrop for the company's range of professional-schooladmissions tests, too.   E.T.S. has moved to diversify. The company makescertification and licensing tests for dozens of industriesand professions, from architecture to food preparation toteaching. E.T.S. also has taken on a variety of privatecompanies as clients in recent years, evaluating theirinternal training and testing programs.   Overall demand for employee evaluation is huge. About halfof all companies conduct some form of competency testing,mostly among job applicants, according to a recent AmericanManagement Association survey. And the number is expected togrow, as companies step up their efforts to find the bestworkers they can in a shrinking pool of young people.   E.T.S. contends its new products will differ from manycurrent personnel tests because they will be computer-based,and will generate diagnoses for further training as well asassessments. &quot;One thing that's happened in corporate trainingprograms is that companies never know whether that trainingtakes,&quot; Ms. Irby says.   The software packages set for announcement today aredesigned to test users of WordPerfect, DisplayWrite, andMicrosoft Word, three popular word-processing programs. Thetests will take between 20 and 30 minutes each. They will runthrough a variety of tasks and then score performance -- andrecommend additional training -- in such areas as editingskills, file management and document creation. Eachtest-taker will also receive one of three ratings: junior,senior or specialist. (Anyone taking a test presumably wouldhave at least some experience with the program in question.)   E.T.S. developed the tests in conjunction with closelyheld Kee Incorp, Columbia, Md., which markets computertraining classes. Kee had tried to develop the tests on itsown, but clients balked because they weren't certain aboutthe validity of the exams, says Doug Becker, Kee's executivevice-president.   E.T.S. agreed to become a partner but &quot;required that werebuild the test from scratch&quot; to ensure fairness, he says.   Kee says it trained 300,000 people last year in one-dayclasses on various software programs. The new software testsare to be marketed through subscriptions costing $795annually, with additional charges for each product. &quot;Demandfor a program like this is in the tens of millions ofdollars,&quot; Mr. Becker says.   Kee and E.T.S. are beginning work on tests, expected abouta year from now, that will gauge expertise on Lotus 1-2-3 andother spreadsheet programs. Other exams are underconsideration to measure how well people can handle data baseand operating system programs, Mr. Becker says.   More broadly, E.T.S. is developing a variety of &quot;workplaceliteracy&quot; exams for testing and training employees at allcorporate levels, from clerks to managers, Ms. Irby says.   It's too early to know how such tests will turn out, Ms.Irby says, but they will probably involve interactivevideo-based systems, offering test-takers a chance to answerquestions via computer. Such technology is the basis for anew 20-hour training and testing program E.T.S. has helpeddevelop for appraising nursing assistants, Ms. Irby says. Thetests for general office skills may be ready within twoyears, she adds.   One arena likely to be affected by the word-processingexams is the temporary-help industry. Olsten Corp., Westbury,N.Y., is installing the E.T.S./Kee programs in its 540 tempoffices, and believes they will lead to a &quot;more precisematch&quot; between client needs and the secretaries sent into theworkplace. But the nation's largest temp company, ManpowerInc., based in Milwaukee, questioned whether the new examswould prove superior to word-processing tests it developedfor its offices.   Testing industry experts say that the new tests, simplybecause their focus is so specific, may mark an improvementover many broad-based employment exams currently available.   But the tests could prove problematic, they say, ifemployers set fixed cutoff scores and use the exams toexclude workers who may be worth hiring and training. &quot;A testis a tool that can be used or applied poorly,&quot; says Mr. Haneyof Boston College.   Cinthia Schuman, executive director of the National Centerfor Fair and Open Testing, a Cambridge, Mass., test-reformgroup, says employers shouldn't latch onto the tests simplybecause they may be billed as &quot;validated&quot; by E.T.S., giventhe company's role in developing them, too.   &quot;Where are the people completely outside the system whohave no financial stake in the outcome?&quot; she asks. &quot;Where arethey in the process? That's what independent validation is.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
