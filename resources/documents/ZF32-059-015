(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Fisher, Harry D.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Ada Will Go the Way of EsperantoandM;Referring to the article headed &quot;Only Time Will Tell if Ada DominatesProgramming&quot; in the Aug. 5 GCN, I can only say: What a diatribe!andM;I think it is presumptuous of the proponents of a programming language thathas been around for as short a time as Ada to want to do away with all otherlanguages.andP;  C has been around less than 10 years; you don't see the Cprogrammers trying to do away with the other languages.andM;The attitude of the Ada proponents is offensive.andP;  The other languages are&quot;entrenched&quot;; Cobol is difficult to &quot;eradicate.&quot;andP;  The list of complaints iswithout end.andM;There is absolutely no reason to eliminate Cobol, a language perfectly suitedto the type of applications for which it is most commonly used, which is thereason for its continuing popularity.andM;An analogy with Esperanto springs to mind.andP;  At some time early this century,a group of visionaries determined that what was needed to bring peace onearth and goodwill to all men was common language, one that would replace theother languages currently in use.andP;  They came up with Esperanto, a concoctionof elements of Germanic, Slavic, Latin and other languages.andP;  I believe therestill are groups out there trying to keept the Esperanto dream alive.andM;Let's face it, the reason for the arrogance and intolerance of the Adaproponents is that the language has the backing of the Defense Department.andO;Were it not for that support, Ada would have already sunk like a stone, orrather, it would have gone the way of other large, cumbersome, dinosaurlanguages such as PL/1.andM;Ada is doomed because no one likes to use it.andP;  The Department of Defensewould do wisely to seek a replacement, the sooner the better.andP;  Ada has beenaround long enough to have caught on by now, but it hasn't.andP;  Just look at Cand compare the reception in the user community.andP;  In the matter of language,you can't force usage.andP;  Maybe you can constrain programmers to use it on aparticular project, but after that they will disappear back to their &quot;native&quot;languages -- Cobol, Fortran, Lisp or C, wherever they feel the mostcomfortable -- with a sigh of relief.andM;Harry D.
