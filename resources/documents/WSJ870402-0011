The vote was 65-35 but two-thirds, or 67 votes, were needed, and Democrats will try to reverse that outcome as early as today. As Reagan continued pressing for support, leaders of both parties said Senate concurrence with earlier House action to enact the bill appeared likely, perhaps by a single vote. A last-minute switch by freshman Sen. Sanford, the lone Democratic dissenter, gave Reagan the tentative victory on the $87.5 billion road and mass transit legislation, but Sanford, under pressure, later changed his mind.    Senate GOP Leader Dole held up the final vote to give the White House time to make its case about the importance of the Senate's sustaining the veto.    ---   CASEY HELPED CREATE the private network that armed Nicaraguan rebels.    The actions by the ex-CIA chief, then the top U.S. intelligence officer and a Reagan confidante, came while Congress cut off U.S. military aid for the Contras, current and ex-U.S. officials said. Casey also encouraged a top aide, an ex-Nicaragua station chief, to retire at the end of 1985 to work overseas in the multimillion-dollar Contra aid network overseen by then-NSC aide Lt. Col. North, to help sustain the rebels between late 1984 and last October.    As CIA director, Casey assigned several veteran intelligence officers to help the insurgents, and was briefed by North about the operation, the officials said.    ---   Reagan called for AIDS education programs, saying local schools and parents should decide how to approach prevention efforts against &quot;public health enemy No. 1.&quot; He told the Philadelphia College of Physicians the programs must stress morality and avoid a &quot;value neutral&quot; approach. He also pledged to back efforts to find a cure.    ---   Pope John Paul II urged Chileans to use &quot;peace over violence&quot; in solving political problems. His arrival for a six-day visit, after calling the military government dictatorial, sparked street protests against President Pinochet, who defended his regime as a legitimate response to what he described as communism.    ---   Italy's President Cossiga said he rejected the month-old resignation of Socialist Premier Craxi and told him to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament, in a bid to head off early elections. Craxi's five-party coalition collapsed March 3 when he stepped down after feuding between his party and the dominant Christian Democrats.    ---   Investigators assume the U.S. Embassy security breach in Moscow by Marine ex-guards let the Soviets decode secret message traffic, Pentagon sources said. Use of lie detectors has been cleared in interrogating guards, and further cases of guards' fraternization with Soviet women probably will be disclosed, the sources said.    ---   Thatcher ended her visit to the U.S.S.R., proclaiming a &quot;new chapter&quot; in bilateral relations. The British prime minister met with Jewish activist Iosif Begun, who said Thatcher told him the Kremlin views emigration rights as an &quot;internal affair.&quot; Soviet leader Gorbachev said he and Thatcher can do business despite their differences.    ---   The Reagan administration said companies in France, Italy and Israel are selling arms to South Africa in violation of a U.N. arms embargo. The report to Congress said the firms probably are conducting the sales &quot;with the knowledge of their governments.&quot;    ---   The space agency said it is planning a design competition for a new shuttle booster rocket to be delivered in 1993. But in the meantime, Morton Thiokol will remain the sole supplier, NASA said in a report sent to Congress.    ---   West Germany swapped convicted spies with East Germany, security sources said. The four-for-four exchange included a former Bonn defense ministry clerk, Lothar Lutze, who began serving a 12-year jail sentence in 1979. East Germany handed over agents described as &quot;not insignificant.&quot; Officials wouldn't confirm or deny the swap.    ---   Israel said it agreed to exchange official visits with the Soviet Union, amid signs of rising emigration for Soviet Jews and efforts by Moscow to enter the Mideast peace process. Each nation hopes this will lead to a renewal of ties cut by Moscow during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Israeli officials said.    ---   Brazilian government banks reopened in major cities as a nationwide strike by bank workers began to weaken. Strikers had sought a 100% wage increase, but voted to accept a 50% wage boost over one year. The walkout over pay issues began March 24. About 15% of the more than 700,000 workers remained on strike, an official said.    ---   A think tank warned of a &quot;significant contraction of U.S. military capability in the 1990s&quot; unless the government acts to refine defense procurement practices. The independent Washington-based organization urged Congress to streamline its Pentagon budget oversight and to simplify arms-buying rules.    ---   The White House budget chief assailed the main welfare-revision bill being pushed by House Democrats. James Miller told a congressional panel that the legislation would increase rather than eliminate welfare dependency. </TEXT></DOC>
