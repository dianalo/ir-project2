An embargo imposed in 1977 on South Africa prompted it to create its own arms industry. Today, South Africa is 95% militarily self-sufficient, and the government-owned Arms Corp. of South Africa is one of the world's leading arms exporters. Israel's busy arms industry, too, is the product of an international embargo after the Six-Day War in 1967.    Now, defense specialists say, Iran, which is the target of an admittedly leaky embargo by most Western countries, is following the example set by the two previous outcasts. The embargo, they say, hasn't prevented Iran from making or buying the arms to pursue its war with Iraq.    &quot;Certainly, Iran is building up a defense industry,&quot; says Aaron Karp, an analyst at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Some experts say Iran already can fill as much as half of its defense needs and boasts large arms factories in Isfahan and Shiraz. Much of what Iran produces is munitions -- artillery shells, bullets, and sea and land mines. But it also makes small arms, missiles, and some artillery pieces. Iran needs only to import explosives and basic commodities such as steel.    &quot;They are seven years into this war,&quot; says Heino Kopietz, senior economist at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London. &quot;Seven years ago they were buying howitzer fuses. They don't even buy those anymore. They make them themselves.&quot;    Even countries that bar arms sales to Iran permit it to purchase the basic commodities to make munitions. It has succeeded in buying large quantities of explosives from the West. Iran turns out mountains of munitions, mainly using plants built by the U.S., West Germany and Czechoslovakia during the shah's reign.    &quot;Arms embargoes, unless globally supported, aren't effective,&quot; says Mr. Kopietz of the London institute. &quot;There are too many renegade countries out there.&quot;    Like Iraq, Iran has also established an extensive research effort in chemical and nuclear weapons. Not only are there thousands of scientists trained in the West during the shah's reign, but also nuclear power plants provide technology for such weapons. A study by Anthony H. Cordesman, published last month by the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies in London, concludes that the Khomeini regime has revived a nuclear-weapons research program at a small five-megawatt reactor in Tehran.    &quot;Unless a far more stable political settlement is reached than now seems possible, both Iraq and Iran will almost certainly continue their nuclear and chemical arms race to the point where both have large chemical stockpiles, at least some nuclear weapons, and extensive numbers of long-range aircraft and missiles,&quot; writes Mr. Cordesman. Nuclear weapons could be available as early as 1995, he says.    International arms experts express another worry: If Iran becomes militarily self-sufficient, it could join South Africa and Israel in exporting war equipment to other renegade countries. The result, observers fear, could be a dangerous division in the arms business -- those countries that will supply weapons only to internationally accepted markets, and a handful of countries that will sell to anyone.    Already, South Africa and Israel are suppliers to countries like Iran that can't openly get arms elsewhere. </TEXT></DOC>
