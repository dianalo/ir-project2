Such gains are likely, he says, even if a recession forces paper firms to drop plans for a 5% to 8% price increase early next year. &quot;This industry has everything going for it except a rocky stock market,&quot; says Mr. Clephane.    The paper industry's main strengths are a weak dollar and tremendous demand. The industry's operating rate is the highest since 1973, with no noticeable customer inventory buildup. Exports even to such European strongholds as Scandinavia are surging. Two price increases that went through in 1987 have stuck. And a concerted cutback in labor costs has fattened many firms' margins.    Moreover, the trend is for &quot;more of the same,&quot; says American Paper Institute economist Benjamin Slatin.    While a recession would damp demand, Gary Palmero of Oppenheimer andamp; Co. says many firms' profits would hold up well because of the low dollar and recent stringent cost-cutting. Moreover, analysts say, a recession likely wouldn't much affect sales of consumer items such as tissue paper and disposable diapers.    Mr. Tetrick, for example, is recommending Kimberly-Clark and Scott Paper specifically because of their consumer orientation.    Many in the industry don't yet see any signs of a business downturn. &quot;There's been no visible change&quot; in economic activity since the market crash, says David L. Luke III, chairman and chief executive of Westvaco in New York. Mr. Luke says he keeps looking for clouds on the horizon but finds only bright spots such as low inflation, reasonable interest rates and good labor relations within the industry.    As a result, Westvaco plans capital expenditures of $350 million to $400 million in each of the next two years, compared with $200 million in 1987. That money, he adds, will go not just to add new capacity but also for new product technology. Westvaco gets many analysts' nods because of its innovative product mix, which includes, among other things, new frozen-food packaging.    Mr. Palmero's favorites are the export-oriented firms, including International Paper and Federal Paper Board. Mr. Tetrick, however, recommends selling International Paper because of labor problems. There have been strikes since last summer at three of the company's mills and a lockout at a fourth. Mr. Tetrick instead recommends the biggest linerboard manufacturer, Fort Howard Paper.    Mr. Tetrick says the crash may actually have helped paper firms because they have a history of botching boom periods by adding too much capacity too quickly, thereby precipitating inventory buildups and price drops. This time, however, Mr. Tetrick expects firms to move cautiously on capacity additions because of the October stock scare.    Investors, Mr. Palmero muses, &quot;tend to like exotic stories,&quot; while the paper industry's success is strictly fundamental. Adds Mr. Luke: &quot;Right now, the investment community is still trying to decide whether they believe (the industry's) good news. We see a lot of strong factors working to our advantage.&quot;    Morgan Stanley is so impressed that it has given the paper industry a triple-weighted position, equal to 7% of an investor's portfolio. Mr. Clephane says that if the January price increase sticks, full-year earnings for the group's leading firms will rise about 35% to 40% from 1987 results, which are expected to be quite strong. Without the January increase, he adds, full-year profits should still be about 15% to 20% better than 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
