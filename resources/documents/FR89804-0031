This part will replacePart 208 and andSection;andSection; 230.3 and 230.4 of chapter II, and amendandSection; 260.1 of chapter II. The Board's present regulations concerningdisability determinations were promulgated under the Railroad RetirementAct of 1937, and no longer adequately describe the process by which theBoard makes disability determinations as provided for in the Act. Consequently,these regulations have been totally revised.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received by the Secretary to the Boardon or before October 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Secretary to the Board, Railroad Retirement Board, 844North Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Grace Koester, Director of Hearingsand Appeals, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 North Rush Street, Chicago,Illinois 60611, telephone 312-751-4790.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>These proposed regulations providerules for the three types of disability decisions made by the Board; namely,occupational disability, disability for any regular employment and disabilityas defined in the Social Security Act. In general, the proposed regulationsprovide for a sequential method of evaluating disability which initiallytakes into consideration all medical evidence and then proceeds to considersuch vocational factors as age, education and work experience. In thisregard many of the proposed regulations parallel the regulations of theSocial Security Administration found in Subpart P, Part 404, of Title 20(Determining Disability and Blindness). This is because courts have heldthat ``regular employment'' as that term is used in the Act has the samemeaning as the term ``substantial gainful activity'' as that term is usedin the Social Security Act. See, for example, <T3>Peppers </T3>v. <T3>Railroad Retirement Board, </T3>728 F. 2d 404 (7th Cir., 1984). Theproposed regulations also include the requirements set forth in the recentproposed regulations of the Social Security Administration dealing withconsultative examinations. See 52 FR 13014-13031. These proposed regulationsalso provide for trial work periods during which disabled individuals mayattempt to work without jeopardizing loss of any disability benefits. Finally,the proposed rules provide a procedure which must be followed before disabilitybenefits may be terminated. Proposed Part 220 is divided into 15 Subparts,A through O.<T3>Subpart A, General </T3>(andSection;andSection; 220.1 through 220.3), isintroductory in nature and sets forth the three types of disability decisions,described above, made by the Board.<T3>Subpart B, General Definition of Terms Used in This Part </T3>(andSection;220.5), defines certain terms used throughout Part 220.<T3>Subpart C, Disability Under the Railroad Retirement Act for Work inRegular Occupation </T3>(andSection;andSection; 220.10 through 220.21), setsforth the requirements which an employee must meet to receive a disabilityannuity because of his or her inability to work in his or her regular occupation.Proposed andSection; 220.10 provides that in order to receive this annuityan employee must be unable to engage in his or her regular occupation (definedin andSection; 220.11) because of a permanent physical or mental condition.Proposed andSection; 220.13 describes the process by which the Board evaluatesclaims for this type of disability annuity. Generally speaking, if an employerdoes not allow an employee to continue working for medical reasons he orshe will be found disabled for his or her occupation. However, the Boardmay find the employee disabled or not disabled regardless of the employer'sfindings by evaluating his or her impairments against the requirementsof his or her job.<T3>Subpart D, Disability Under the Railroad Retirement Act for Any RegularEmployment </T3>(andSection;andSection; 220.25 through 220.30), sets forththe requirements which an employee, child, widow(er) must meet in orderto receive an annuity because he or she is disabled for any regular employment.Proposed andSection; 220.26 provides that in order to receive such an annuitythe claimant must show that he or she is unable to engage in any substantialgainful activity because of a permanent physical or mental condition.<T3>Subpart E, Disability Determination Governed by the Regulations ofthe Social Security Administration </T3>(andSection;andSection; 220.35 through220.39), describes when the Board has authority to determine when someoneis disabled as that term is defined in the Social Security Act. Such determinationsare made by the Board where they may increase an individual's annuity underthe Act or provide for Medicare coverage prior to the age of 65. In addition,in order to pay a disability annuity to a surviving divorced spouse orremarried widow(er) he or she must be found disabled under the Social SecurityAct (proposed andSection; 220.39). This subpart emphasizes that in makingthe determinations described therein the Board follows Subpart P, Part404, of Title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations and not the regulationsin this part.<T3>Subpart F, Evidence of Disability </T3>(andSection;andSection; 220.45 through220.48), describes what type of evidence the Board considers in makingdisability determinations.<T3>Subpart G, Consultative Examinations </T3>(andSection;andSection; 220.50through 220.64), describes the process the Board follows for developingmedical evidence in a disability claim. The proposed regulations make clearthat the Board will request and make every reasonable effort to obtainmedical evidence from the claimant's treating sources. The proposed regulationsalso describe when the Board will require a claimant to take a medicalexamination at the Board's expense in order to assist the Board in makingthe disability determination.<T3>Subpart H, Evaluation of Disability </T3>(andSection;andSection;220.100through 220.105), describes the process which the Board proposes to usein determining whether one is unable to engage in any regular employmentbecause of a disability. In general, the proposed process parallels thatas provided for in the Social Security Administration Regulations: SubpartP of Part 404 of Title 20. Under this process if a claimant's impairmentsare not severe enough to merit a rating of disability on the medical evidencealone, the Board will look to see if the claimant can do his or her pastrelevant work. If he or she cannot, then the Board will determine whetherthe individual can do any other work. Proposed andSection;220.101 also describesthe additional considerations the Board will use when evaluating any mentalimpairment(s) a claimant may have.<T3>Subpart I, Medical Considerations</T3> (andSection;andSection;220.110 through220.115), describes a listing of medical impairments which are found atAppendix 1 of the proposed regulations. If a claimant has an impairmentwhich, based upon medical findings, is identical or medically equivalentto one listed in Appendix 1, he or she is considered to be unable to engagein any regular employment unless he or she is actually working. ProposedandSection;220.113 describes medical findings as consisting of symptoms,signs and laboratory findings. Proposed andSection;220.114 provides thatan individual will not be found to be disabled based upon his or her owndescription of his or her symptoms unless medical signs or laboratory findingsshow an impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce those symptoms.Proposed andSection;220.115 describes when the Board will deny an applicationfor a disability annuity or stop paying a disability annuity because theclaimant fails to follow prescribed treatment.<T3>Subpart J, Residual Functional Capacity </T3>(andSection;andSection;220.120through 220.121), describes how the Board determines what an individualcan do despite limitations because of physical or mental impairments. Whenan individual cannot be found disabled, either occupationally or for anyregular employment, based upon medical consideration alone, the residualfunctional capacity determination is a threshold step in determining what,if any, other type of work the claimant can do. This determination willinclude a consideration of what the claimant's treating physicians havestated the claimant can do.<T3>Subpart K, Vocational Considerations</T3> (andSection;andSection;220.125through 220.134), applies only to claimants who claim they are disabledfor any regular employment. When the Board cannot decide whether such aclaimant is disabled based upon medical evidence alone, it then makes aresidual functional capacity determination as provided in Subpart J. Ifbased upon this determination it is found that a claimant cannot do worksimilar to that which he has done in the past, then the Board applies thevocational considerations in this subpart to determine whether an individualcan do any other type of work which exists in the national economy. ProposedandSection;220.129 describes the effect of an individual's educational backgroundon this type of disability determination. Proposed andSection;220.130 describesthe impact of an individual's past work experience upon this type of disabilitydetermination. Proposed andSection;220.131 defines work which exists in thenational economy and how the Board determines the existence of such work.Proposed andSection;220.133 describes how in evaluating an individual's pastwork it is categorized as unskilled, semi-skilled or skilled with or withoutskills transferable. Proposed andSection;220.134 describes the listing ofmedical-vocational guidelines found in Appendix 2 of this proposed part.These rules set forth combinations of residual functional capacity, describedin terms of physical exertion (proposed andSection;220.132), age, educationand previous work experience. After each combination there is an indicateddecision of disabled or not disabled. Thus, for example, rule andSection;201.01provides that an individual who has the residual functional capacity todo sedentary work (proposed andSection;220.132(a)) who is of advanced age(proposed andSection;220.128(d)), and whose previous work experience is unskilled(proposed andSection;220.133(b)) is found disabled. However, if the sameindividual has transferable skills (proposed andSection;220.133(e)) he orshe would be found <T3>not</T3> disabled under rule 201.03. These rules only apply if allthe findings of fact about the claimant's vocational factors and the residualfunctional capacity meet the profile set forth in the rule. If the ruleapplies, the decision as to whether one is disabled or not is governedby the rule (proposed andSection;220.134(c)).<T3>Subpart L, Substantial Gainful Activity</T3> (andSection;andSection;220.140through 220.145), defines substantial gainful activity. Under proposedandSection;220.141 substantial gainful activity is work which involves significantphysical or mental activity and which an individual does for pay or profit.As noted in proposed Subpart D, an individual must be found unable to dosubstantial gainful activity in order to receive an annuity based uponhis or her inability to engage in any regular employment. Proposed andSection;220.143describes how the amount of an individual's earnings may create a presumptionas to whether or not such person is engaging in substantial gainful activity.Proposed andSection;220.144 describes how the Board evaluates a self-employedindividual to determine if he or she is engaging in substantial gainfulactivity. Proposed andSection;220.145 describes how the Board takes intoconsideration impairment-related work expenses, such as wheel chairs, prostheticdevices, braille typewriters, in determining an individual's earnings whenapplying andSection;220.143.<T3>Subpart M, Disability Annuity Earnings Restrictions </T3>(andSection;andSection;220.160 through 220.164), describes the effect of earnings upon an employeereceiving a disability annuity, whether occupational or due to inabilityto engage in any regular employment. An employee annuity is suspended inany month in which an employee earns $400 or more in employment or self-employment(proposed andSection; 220.161(b)). However, if the employee's earnings areless than $5000 a year all annuities withheld are paid back at the endof the year. The earnings limitations in this subpart are not to be confusedwith the earnings tests found in proposed andSection; 220.143 of proposedSubpart L. As noted earlier these tests are used to determine whether anindividual is engaged in substantial gainful activity. Suffering a deductionin one's annuity under this subpart because of earnings of more than $5000a year does not necessarily mean the employee is engaging in substantialgainful activity. Proposed andSection; 220.162 explains the reporting requirementswith regard to earnings that disability annuitants must follow, and proposedandSection; 220.163 explains the penalties for failure to report earnings.<T3>Subpart N, Trial Work Period and Reentitlement Period for AnnuitantsDisabled for Any Regular Employment </T3>(andSection;andSection; 220.170 through220.171), describes the trial work period for annuitants who are unableto engage in any regular employment. This is a period of nine months inwhich the individual may work and the Board will not consider that workas showing that the annuitant's disability has ended. Proposed andSection;220.171 describes the reentitlement period which follows the trial workperiod. During this period an individual may have his or her annuity terminatedbecause he or she engages in substantial gainful activity but should substantialgainful activity cease, he or she may begin to receive the disability annuityagain without a new application or a new determination of disability.<T3>Subpart O, Continuing or Stopping Disability Due to Substantial GainfulActivity or Medical Improvement </T3>(andSection;andSection; 220.175 through220.184), describes the process under which the Board would determine whetheran individual continues to be disabled for purposes of receiving an annuitybased upon his or her inability to engage in regular employment. Generally,unless the annuitant has demonstrated his or her ability to engage in substantialgainful activity, for example, by the amount of his or her earnings (proposedSubpart L), in order to terminate an annuity the Board must determine ifthere has been any medical improvement in the annuitant's impairment and,if so, whether this medical improvement is related to the annuitant's abilityto work (proposed andSection; 220.178). If the Board finds that there isno medical improvement, then it must determine whether one of the exceptionsto the medical improvement rule exists. These exceptions are found in proposedandSection; 220.179. If medical improvement related to ability to work hasnot occurred and no exception applies, the disability annuity will continue.However, even where medical improvement related to ability to work hasoccurred or an exception to medical improvement applies, the Board mustalso show that the annuitant is currently able to engage in any substantialgainful activity before it can terminate the annuity (proposed andSection;220.180). Proposed andSection; 220.183 provides that no disability annuitywill be terminated without advanced written notice to the annuitant andwithout an opportunity being provided to the annuitant to show that heor she is still disabled.The Board will perform continuing disability review at the same intervalsas required in regulations of the Social Security Administration. Althoughnot included in this notice, the Board will incorporate provisions identicalto those found in 20 CFR 404.1590 (dealing with how often disability reviewsare conducted by the Social Security Administration) into this regulationbefore promulgating it as a final rule.The Board has determined that this is not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder No. 12291; therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required.The information collection requirements contained in this proposed rulehave been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the PaperworkReduction Act. The public reporting burden for the collection of informationat 20 CFR 220.36(b)(6) (OMB No. 3220-0002), 220.45 (OMB No. 3220-0002,3220-0030, 3220-0106, 3220-0141), 220.46 (OMB No. 3220-0038), and 220.50(OMB No. 3220-0124) is estimated to average 28, 28, 22, 10, 30, 24, and60 minutes per response respectively, including the time for reviewingthe completed form. If you wish, send comments regarding the accuracy ofour estimates or any other aspects of these information collections, includingsuggestions for reducing completion time, to the Director of InformationResources Management, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago,IL 60611 and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork ReductionProject, Washington, DC 20503.A distribution table is provided to show the disposition of the old Part208 and portions of Part 230.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Distribution Table</T4><H1>Current section and name</H1><H1>New section and name</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">208.9 Regular occupation defined <D>220.11 Regular occupation defined.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">208.10 Permanent physical or mental condition <D>220.12 Permanent physical or mental condition.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>220.28 How long the impairment must last.</D><ITAG tagnum="1">208.11 Establishment of permanent disability for work in the applicant's``regular occupation'' <D>220.13 Establishment of permanent disability for work in the regularoccupation.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">208.17 Establishment of permanent disability for work in any regularemployment <D>220.26 Disability for any regular employment, defined.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>220.110 Listing of Impairments in Appendix 1.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>220.141 Substantial gainful activity, defined.</D><ITAG tagnum="1">208.25 Proof of continuance of disability <D>220.176 When disability continues or ends.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">208.27 Disability annuitant to notify of recovery from disability andof employment or self-employment <D>220.162 Earnings report.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">208.29 Cessation of eligibility for disability annuities <D>220.48 If the claimant fails to submit medical or other evidence.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>220.52 Failure to appear at a consultative examination.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>220.181 The month in which the Board will find that the annuitant isno longer disabled.</D><ITAG tagnum="1">208.31 Cessation of disability annuity not prejudicial to further eligibility<D>Obsolete.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">230.3 Loss of disability annuity because of earnings and penalties<D>220.162 Earnings report.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>220.163 Employee penalty deductions.</D><ITAG tagnum="1">230.4 Limit of loss of disability annuity because of earnings and penalty<D>220.164 Employee end-of-the-year adjustment.</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>20 CFR Parts 208 and 220Disability benefits.20 CFR Parts 230 and 260 Railroad employees.For the reasons set out in the preamble, chapter 11 of title 20 of theCode of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows:1.

In some determinations of disability entitlement, asdescribed below, the Board makes the decision of disability under the RailroadRetirement Act based on the regulations set out in this part. However,in certain other determinations of disability entitlement (as also describedbelow) the Board has the authority to decide whether the claimant is disabledas that term is defined in the Social Security Act and the regulationsof the Social Security Administration. (b) In order for a claimant to become entitled to a railroad retirementannuity based on disability for his or her regular railroad occupation,or to become entitled to a railroad retirement annuity based on disabilityfor any regular employment as an employee, widow(er), or child, he or shemust be disabled as those terms are defined in the Railroad RetirementAct. In order for a claimant to become entitled to a period of disability,to early Medicare coverage based on disability, to benefits under the socialsecurity overall minimum, or to a disability annuity as a surviving divorcedspouse or remarried widow(er) the claimant must be found disabled as thatterm is defined in the Social Security Act. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">The basis for the Board's disability decisions. </ITAG>(a) The Board makes disability decisions for claims of disability underthe Railroad Retirement Act. These decisions are based either on the rulescontained in the Board's regulations in this part or the rules containedin the regulations of the Social Security Administration, whichever iscontrolling. (b) A disability decision is made only if the claimant meets other basiceligibility requirements for the specific disability benefit for whichhe is applying. For example, a claimant for an occupational disabilityannuity must first meet the eligibility requirements for that annuity,as explained in Part 216 of this chapter, in order for the Board to makea disability decision. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Determinations by other organizations and agencies. </ITAG>Determinations of the Social Security Administration or any other governmentalor non-governmental agency about whether or not a claimant is disabledunder the laws, regulations or standards administered by that agency shallbe considered by the Board but are not binding on the Board. <ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart B_General Definitions of Terms Used in This Part </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions as used in this part. </ITAG>``Act'' means the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974. ``Application'' refers only to a form described in Part 217 of this chapter.``Board'' means the Railroad Retirement Board Agency. ``Claimant'' means the person for whom an application for an annuity, periodof disability or Medicare coverage is filed. ``Eligible'' means that a person would meet all the requirements for paymentof an annuity but has not yet applied. ``Employee'' is defined in Part 203 of this title. ``Entitled'' means that a person has applied and has proven his or herright to have the annuity, period of disability, or Medicare coverage tobegin. ``Medical Source'' refers to both a treating source and a source of record.``Review physician''_a medical doctor either employed by or under contractto the Board who upon request reviews medical evidence and provides medicaladvice. ``Social Security Overall Minimum'' refers to the provision of the RailroadRetirement Act which guarantees that the total monthly annuities payableto an employee and his or her family will not be less than the total monthlyamount which would be payable under the Social Security Act if the employee'srailroad service were credited as employment under the Social SecurityAct. ``Source of Record'' means a hospital, clinic or other source that hasprovided a claimant with medical treatment or evaluation, as well as aphysician or psychologist who has treated or evaluated a claimant but doesnot have an ongoing relationship with him or her. ``Treating Source'' means the claimant's own physician or psychologistwho has provided the claimant with medical treatment or evaluation andwho has an ongoing treatment relationship with him or her. <ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart C_Disability Under the Railroad Retirment Act for Work inthe Regular Occupation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.10</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Disability for work in the regular occupation. </ITAG>In order to receive an occupational disability annuity, an eligible employeemust be found by the Board to be disabled for work in his or her regularoccupation because of a permanent physical or mental impairment. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Regular occupation, defined. </ITAG>(a) For the purpose of this Part, an employee's ``regular occupation''shall be his or her occupation in the railroad industry in which_ (1) He or she has been engaged in service for hire in more calendar monthsthan the calendar months in which he or she has been engaged in servicefor hire in any other occupation during the last preceding five calendaryears, whether or not consecutive; or (2) He or she has engaged in service for hire in not less than one-halfof all of the months in which he or she has been engaged in service forhire during the last preceding 15 consecutive calendar years. (b) If an employee last worked as an officer or employee of a railway labororganization and if continuance in such employment is no longer availableto him or her, the ``regular occupation'' shall be the position to whichthe employee holds seniority rights or the position which he or she leftto work for a railway labor organization. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.12</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Permanent physical or mental impairment, defined. </ITAG>For the purposes of this Part, the term ``permanent physical or mentalimpairment'' means a physical or mental impairment or combination of impairmentsthat can be expected to result in death or has lasted, or can be expectedto last, for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.13</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Establishment of permanent disability for work in the regular occupation.</ITAG>The Board usually considers an employee disabled for work in his or herregular occupation if the employer does not allow the employee to continueworking in that occupation for a medically documented reason and the Boardhas evidence that supports the conclusion that the employee is unable toperform the duties of his or her regular occupation because of a permanentphysical or mental impairment. (See andSection;220.21 if the claimant isnot currently disabled but was previously occupationally disabled for aspecified period of time in the past.) The Board uses the following evaluationprocess in determining disability for work in the regular occupation: (a) The Board evaluates the employee's medically documented physical andmental impairment(s) to determine if the employee has an impairment whichis listed in the Listing of Impairments in Appendix 1 of this part. ThatListing describes impairments which are considered severe enough to preventa person from doing any substantial gainful activity. If the Board findsthat an employee has an impairment which is listed or is equal to one whichis listed, it will find the employee disabled for work in his or her regularoccupation without considering the duties of his or her regular occupation.(b) If the Board finds that the employee does not have an impairment describedin (a) above, it will_ (1) Review the occupations which the employee has held in the last 5-15calendar years in which he or she was employed, to determine his or herregular occupation (see andSection;220.11); and (2) Determine what the physical and mental demands of the employee's regularoccupation are. In making this determination, the Board will consider theemployee's own description of his or her regular occupation and all informationobtained from his or her employer(s). The Board may also take administrativenotice of reliable job information available from various governmentaland other publications; and (3) Evaluate the employee's physical and mental impairments to determinewhat limitations these impairments cause. The Board will consider the effectof all of the employee's medically documented impairments to determinewhether he or she retains the capacity to meet the physical and mentaldemands of his or her regular occupation. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Evidence considered. </ITAG>The regulations explaining the employee's responsibility to provide evidenceof disability, the kind of evidence, what medical evidence consists of,and the consequences of refusing or failing to provide evidence or to havea medical examination are found in andSection; 220.45 through andSection;220.48.The regulations explaining when the employee may be requested to reportfor a consultative examination are found in andSection;220.50 and andSection;220.51.The regulations explaining how the Board evaluates conclusions by physiciansconcerning the employee's disability, how the Board evaluates the employee'ssymptoms, what medical findings consist of, and the need to follow prescribedtreatment are found in andSection;220.112 through andSection;220.115. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.15</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Effects of work on occupational disability. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Disability onset when the employee works despite impairment.</T3> Anemployee who has stopped work in his or her regular occupation due to apermanent physical or mental impairment(s) may make an effort to returnto work in his or her regular occupation. If the employee is subsequentlyforced to stop that work after a short time because of his or her impairment(s),the Board will generally consider that work as an unsuccessful work attempt.In this situation, the Board may determine that the employee became disabledfor work in his or her regular occupation before the last date the employeeworked in his or her regular occupation. No annuity will be payable, however,until after the last date worked. (b) <T3>Occupational disability annuitant work restrictions.</T3> The restrictionswhich apply to an annuitant who is disabled for work in his or her regularoccupation are found in andSection;andSection;220.160 through 220.164. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.16</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Responsibility to notify the Board of events which affect disability.</ITAG>If the annuitant is entitled to a disability annuity because he or sheis disabled for work in his or her regular occupation, the annuitant shouldpromptly tell the Board if_ (a) His or her impairment(s) improves; (b) He or she returns to any type of work; (c) He or she increases the amount of work; or(d) His or her earnings increase. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.17</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Recovery from disability for work in the regular occupation. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General.</T3> Disability for work in the regular occupation will endif_ (1) There is medical improvement in the annuitant's impairment(s) to theextent that the annuitant is able to perform the duties of his or her regularoccupation; or (2) The annuitant demonstrates the ability to perform the duties of hisor her regular occupation. The Board provides a trial work period beforeterminating a disability annuity because of the annuitant's return to work.(b) <T3>Definition of the trial work period.</T3> The trial work period isa period during which the annuitant may test his or her ability to workand still be considered occupationally disabled. It begins and ends asdescribed in paragraph (e) of this section. During this period, the annuitantmay perform ``services'' (see paragraph (c) of this section) in as manyas nine months, but these months do not have to be consecutive. The Boardwill not consider those services as showing that the annuitant's occupationaldisability has ended until the annuitant has performed services in at leastnine months. However, after the trial work period has ended, the Boardwill consider the work the annuitant did during the trial work period indetermining whether the annuitant's occupational disability has ended atany time after the trail work period. (c) <T3>What the Board means by services in an occupational disability case.</T3>When used in this section, ``services'' means any activity which,even though it may not be substantial gainful activity as defined in andSection;220.141, is_(1) Done by a person in employment or self-employment for pay or profit,or is the kind normally done for pay or profit; and(2) The activity is a return to the same duties of the annuitant's regularoccupation or the activity so closely approximates the duties of the regularoccupation as to demonstrate the ability to perform those duties.(d) <T3>Limitations on the number of trial work periods. </T3>The annuitantmay have only one trial work period during each period in which he or sheis occupationally disabled.(e) <T3>When the trial work period begins and ends. </T3>(1) The trial workperiod begins with whichever of the following calendar months is the latest_(i) The month disability begins;(ii) The month after the end of the appropriate waiting period; or(iii) The month the application for disability is filed.(2) The trial work period ends with the close of whichever of the followingcalendar months is the earlier_(i) The ninth month (whether or not the months have been consecutive) inwhich the annuitant performed services; or(ii) The month in which new evidence, other than evidence relating to anywork the annuitant did during the trial work period, shows that the annuitantis not disabled, even though the annuitant has not worked a full nine months.The Board may find that the annuitant's disability has ended at any timeduring the trial work period if the medical or other evidence shows thatthe annuitant is no longer disabled.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.18</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">The reentitlement period.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>The reentitlement period is an additional period afterthe nine months of trial work during which the annuitant may continue totest his or her ability to work if the annuitant has a disabling impairment.(b) <T3>When the reentitlement period begins and ends. </T3>The reentitlementperiod begins with the first month following completion of nine monthsof trial work but cannot begin earlier than December 1, 1980. It ends withwhichever is earlier_(1) The month before the first month in which the annuitant's impairment(s)no longer exists or is not medically disabling; or (2) The last day of the fifteenth month following the end of the annuitant'strial work period.(c) <T3>When the annuitant is not entitled to reentitlement period. </T3>Theannuitant is not entitled to a reentitlement period if_(1) The annuitant is not entitled to a trial work period; or (2) The annuitant's disability ended before the annuitant completed ninemonths of trial work in that period in which he or she was disabled.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.19</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Payment of the disability annuity during the trial work period andthe reentitlement period.</ITAG>(a) The employee who is entitled to an occupational disability annuitywill not be paid an annuity for each month in the trial period or reentitlementperiod in which he or she_(1) Works for an employer covered by the Railroad Retirement Act (see andSection;220.160);or(2) Earns more than $400 (after deduction of impairment related work expenses)in employment or self-employment (see andSection;andSection; 220.161 and 220.164).See andSection; 220.145 for the definition of impairment related work expenses.(b) If the employee's occupational disability annuity is stopped becauseof work during the trial work period or reentitlement period, and the employeediscontinues that work before the end of either period, the disabilityannuity may be started again without a new application and a new determinationof disability.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.20</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Notice that an annuitant is no longer disabled.</ITAG>The regulation explaining the Board's responsibilities in notifying theannuitant, and the annuitant's rights when the disability annuity is stoppedis found in andSection; 220.183.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.21</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Initial evaluation of a previous occupational disability.</ITAG>(a) In some cases, the Board may determine that a claimant is not currentlydisabled for work in his or her regular occupation but was previously disabledfor a specified period of time in the past. This can occur when_(1) The disability application was filed before the claimant's occupationaldisability ended, but the Board did not make the initial determinationof occupational disability until after the claimant's disability ended;or (2) The disability application was filed after the claimant's occupationaldisability ended but no later than the 12th month after the month the disabilityended. (b) When evaluating a claim for a previous occupational disability, theBoard follows the steps in andSection;220.13 to determine whether an occupationaldisability existed, and follows the steps in andSection;andSection;220.16 and220.17 to determine when the occupational disability ended.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 1: </T4>The claimant sustained multiple fractures to his leftleg in an automobile accident which occurred on June 16, 1982. For a periodof 18 months following the accident the claimant underwent 2 surgical procedureswhich restored the functional use of his leg. After a recovery period followingthe last surgery, the claimant returned to his regular railroad job onFebruary 1, 1984. The claimant, although fully recovered medically andregularly employed, filed an application on December 3, 1984 for a determinationof occupational disability for the period June 16, 1982 through January31, 1984. The Board reviewed his claim in January 1985 and determined thathe was occupationally disabled for the period which began on June 16, 1982and continued through January 31, 1984. A disability annuity is payableto the employee only for the period December 1, 1983 through January 31,1984. An annuity may not begin any earlier than the 1st day of the 12thmonth before the month in which the application was filed.

However, as of February 1,1984, and before the Board makes a disability determination, the claimantreturns to his regular railroad job and is no longer considered occupationallydisabled. The Board reviews the claimant's application in May of 1984 andfinds him occupationally disabled for the period June 16, 1982 throughJanaury 31, 1984.

To meetthis definition of disability, a claimant must have a severe impairment,which makes him or her unable to do any previous work or other substantialgainful activity which exists in the national economy. To determine whethera claimant is able to do any other work, the Board considers a claimant'sresidual functional capacity, age, education and work experience.

The Board will consider only impairment(s)the claimant claims to have or about which the Board receives evidence.Before deciding that the claimant is not disabled, the Board will developa complete medical history (i.e., evidence from the records of the claimant'smedical sources) covering at least the preceding 12 months, unless theclaimant says that his or her disability began less than 12 months beforehe or she filed an application. The Board will make every reasonable effortto help the claimant in getting medical reports from his or her own medicalsources when the claimant gives the Board permission to request them. Everyreasonable effort means that the Board will make an initial request and,after 20 days, one followup request to the claimant's medical source toobtain the medical evidence necessary to make a determination before theBoard evaluates medical evidence obtained from another source on a consultativebasis. The medical source will have 10 days from the followup request toreply (unless experience indicates that a longer period is advisable ina particular case). In order to expedite processing the Board may ordera consultative exam from a non-treating source while awaiting receipt ofmedical source evidence.

Upon filing an application for a disabilityannuity a claimant will be required to obtain from his or her medical source(s)information regarding the claimed impairments. The Board will seek clarificationfrom a medical source who has provided a report when that report containsa conflict or ambiguity, or does not contain all necessary informationor when the information supplied is not based on objective evidence. TheBoard will not, however, seek clarification from a medical source whenit is clear that the source either cannot or will not provide the necessaryfindings, or cannot reconcile a conflict or ambiguity in the findings providedfrom the source's records. Therefore, before purchasing a consultativeexamination, the Board will consider not only existing medical reports,but also the background report containing the claimant's allegations andinformation about the claimant's vocational background, as well as otherpertinent evidence in his or her file.(2) When the Board purchases a consultative examination, we will use thereport from the consultative examination to try to resolve a conflict orambiguity if one exists. The Board will do this by comparing the persuasivenessand value of the evidence.

If there is a goodreason for the objection, the Board will schedule the examination withanother physician or psychologist. A good reason may be where the consultativeexamination physician or psychologist had previously represented an interestadverse to the claimant. For example, the physician or psychologist mayhave represented the claimant's employer in a worker's compensation caseor may have been involved in an insurance claim or legal action adverseto the claimant. Other things the Board will consider are: language barrier,office location of consultative examination physician or psychologist (2ndfloor, no elevator, etc.), travel restrictions, and examination by thephysician or psychologist in connection with a previous unfavorable determination.If the objection is because a physician or psychologist allegedly ``lacksobjectivity'' (in general, but not in relation to the claimant personally)the Board will review the allegations. To avoid a delay in processing theclaimant's claim, the consultative examination in such a case will be changedto another physician or psychologist while a review is being conducted.Any objection to use of the substitute physician or psychologist will behandled in the same manner. However, if the Board or the Social SecurityAdministration had previously conducted such a review and found that thereports of the consultative physician or psychologist in question conformto the Board's guidelines, then the Board will not change the claimant'sexamination.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.59</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Requesting examination by a specific physician, psychologist or institution_appealsreferee hearing level.</ITAG>In an unusual case, an appeals referee may have reason to request an examinationby a particular physician, psychologist or institution.

Thus,the detail and format for reporting the results of a purchased examinationwill vary depending upon the type of examination or testing requested.The reporting of information will differ from one type of examination toanother when the requested examination relates to the performance of testssuch as ventilatory function tests, treadmill exercise tests, or audiologicaltests. The medical report must be complete enough to help the Board determinethe nature, severity, duration of the impairment and residual functionalcapacity.

This evaluation process applies to employees,widow(er)s, and children who have applied for annuities under the RailroadRetirement Act based on disability for any regular employment. Regularemployment means substantial gainful activity as that term is defined inandSection; 220.141.(b) <T3>Steps in evaluating disability. </T3>A set order is followed to determinewhether disability exists. The duration requirement, as described in andSection;220.28, must be met for a claimant to be found disabled. The Board reviewsany current work activity, the severity of the claimant's impairment(s),the claimant's impairment(s), the claimant's residual functional capacity,and the claimant's age, education, and work experience. If the Board findsthat the claimant is disabled or is not disabled at any step in the process,the Board does not review further. (See andSection; 220.105 if the claimantis not currently disabled but was previously disabled for a specified periodof time in the past.) The steps are as follows: (1) <T3>Claimant is working. </T3>If the claimant is working, and the workis substantial gainful activity, the Board will find that he or she isnot disabled regardless of his or her impairments, age, education, or workexperience. If the claimant is not performing substantial gainful activity,the Board will follow paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (2) <T3>Impairment(s) not severe. </T3>If the claimant does not have an impairmentor combination of impairments which significantly limit his or her physicalor mental ability to do basic work activities, the Board will find thatthe claimant is not disabled without consideration of age, education, orwork experience. If the claimant has an impairment or combination of impairmentswhich significantly limit his or her ability to do basic work activities,the Board will follow paragraph (b)(3) of this section. (See andSection;220.102(b) for a definition of basic work activities.)(3) <T3>Impairment(s) meets or equals one in the Listing of Impairments. </T3>Ifthe claimant has an impairment or combination of impairments which meetsthe duration requirement and such impairment is listed or is medicallyequal to one which is listed in the Listing of Impairments, the Board willfind the claimant disabled without considering his or her age, educationor work experience. (The Listing of Impairments is contained in Appendix1 of this part.) If the claimant's impairment or combination of impairmentsis not listed or is not medically equal to one which is listed in the Listingof Impairments, the Board will follow paragraph (b)(4) of this section.(Medical equivalence is discussed in andSection; 220.111).(4) <T3>Impairment(s) must prevent past relevant work. </T3>If the claimant'simpairment or combination of impairments is not listed or is not medicallyequal to one which is listed in the Listing of Impairments, the Board willthen review the claimant's residual functional capacity (see andSection;220.120) and the physical and mental demands of past relevant work (seeandSection; 220.130). If the Board determines that the claimant is stillable to do his or her past relevant work, the Board will find that he orshe is not disabled. If the claimant is unable to do his or her past relevantwork, the Board will follow paragraph (b)(5) of this section.(5) <T3>Impairment(s) must prevent any other work. </T3>(i) If the claimantis unable to do his or her past relevant work because of his or her impairmentor combination of impairments, the Board will review the claimant's residualfunctional capacity and his or her age, education and work experience todetermine if the claimant is able to do any other work. If the claimantcannot do other work, the Board will find him or her disabled. If the claimantcan do other work, the Board will find the claimant not disabled.(ii) If the claimant has only a marginal education (see andSection; 220.129)and long work experience (i.e., 35 years or more) in which he or she onlydid arduous unskilled physical labor, and the claimant can no longer dothis kind of work, the Board will use a different rule (see andSection; 220.127)to determine disability.(c) Once a claimant has been found eligible to receive a disability annuity,the Board follows a somewhat different order of evaluation to determinewhether the claimant's eligibility continues as explained in andSection;220.180.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.101 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Evaluation of mental impairments. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>The steps outlined in andSection; 220.100 apply to theevaluation of physical and mental impairments. In addition, in evaluatingthe severity of a mental impairment(s), the Board will follow a specialprocedure at each administrative level of review. Following this procedurewill assist the Board in_(1) Identifying additional evidence necessary for the determination ofimpairment severity;(2) Considering and evaluating aspects of the mental impairment(s) relevantto the claimant's ability to work; and (3) Organizing and presenting the findings in a clear, concise, and consistentmanner.(b) <T3>Use of the procedure to record pertinent findings and rate the degreeof functional loss.</T3> (1) This procedure requires the Board to recordthe pertinent signs, symptoms, findings, functional limitations, and effectsof treatment contained in the claimant's case record. This will assistthe Board in determining if a mental impairment(s) exists. Whether or nota mental impairment(s) exists is decided in the same way the question ofa physical impairment is decided, i.e., the evidence must be carefullyreviewed and conclusions supported by it. The mental status examinationand psychiatric history will ordinarily provide the needed information.(See andSection;220.27 for further information about what is needed to showan impairment.)(2) If the Board determines that a mental impairment(s) exists, this procedurethen requires the Board to indicate whether certain medical findings whichhave been found especially relevant to the ability to work are presentor absent.(3) The procedure then requires the Board to rate the degree of functionalloss resulting from the impairment(s). Four areas of function consideredby the Board as essential to work have been identified, and the degreeof functional loss in those areas must be rated on a scale that rangesfrom no limitation to a level of severity which is incompatible with theability to perform those work-related functions. For the first two areas(activities of daily living and social functioning), the rating is donebased upon the following five point scale: none, slight, moderate, marked,and extreme. For the third area (concentration, persistence, or pace),the following five point scale is used: Never, seldom, often, frequent,and constant. For the fourth area (deterioration or decompensation in workor work-like settings), the following four point scale is used: never,once or twice, repeated (three or more), and continual. The last two pointsfor each of these scales represent a degree of limitation which is incompatiblewith the ability to perform the work-related function.(c) <T3>Use of the procedure to evaluate mental impairments.</T3> Followingthe rating of the degree of functional loss resulting from the impairment(s),the Board then determines the severity of the mental impairment(s).(1) If the four areas considered by the Board as essential to work havebeen rated to indicate a degree of limitation as ``none'' or ``slight''in the first and second area, ``never'' or ''seldom'' in the third area,and ``never'' in the fourth area, the Board can generally conclude thatthe impairment(s) is not severe, unless the evidence otherwise indicatesthat there is significant limitation of the claimant's mental ability todo basic work activities (see andSection;220.102).(2) If the claimant's mental impairment(s) is severe, the Board must thendetermine if it meets or equals a listed mental impairment. This is doneby comparing the Board's prior conclusions based on this procedure (i.e.,the presence of certain medical findings considered by the Board as especiallyrelevant to a claimant's ability to work and the Board's rating of functionalloss resulting from the mental impairment(s)) against the criteria of theappropriate listed mental disorder(s).(3) If the claimant has a severe impairment(s), but the impairment(s) neithermeets nor equals the Listings, the Board will then do a residual functionalcapacity assessment for those claimants (employees, widow(er)s, and children)whose applications are based on disability for any regular employment underthe Railroad Retirement Act.(4) At all adjudicative levels, the Board will, in each case, incorporatethe pertinent findings and conclusions based on this procedure in its decisionrationale.

For all others, the evidencemust show that the impairment has lasted or is expected to last for a continuousperiod of at least twelve months. (b) <T3>Adult and Childhood Listings. </T3>The Listing of Impairments consistsof two parts: (1) <T3>Part A </T3>contains medical criteria that apply to claimants age 18and over. The medical criteria in Part A may also be applied in evaluatingimpairments in claimants under age 18 if the disease processes have a similareffect on adults and younger persons. (2) <T3>Part B </T3>contains additional medical criteria that apply only tothe evaluation of impairments of disabled children who are between theages of 16 and 18. Certain criteria in Part A do not give appropriate considerationto the particular effects of the disease processes in childhood: i.e.,when the disease process is generally found only in children or when thedisease process differs in its effect on children than on adults. Additionalcriteria are included in Part B, and the impairment categories are, tothe extent possible, numbered to maintain a relationship with their counterpartsin Part A. In evaluating disability for a child between 16 and 18, PartB will be used first. If the medical criteria in Part B do not apply, thenthe medical criteria in Part A will be used. (c) <T3>How to use the Listing of Impairments. </T3>Each section of the Listingof Impairments has a general introduction containing definitions of keyconcepts used in that section. Certain specific medical findings, someof which are required in establishing a diagnosis or in confirming theexistence of the impairment for the purpose of this Listing, are also givenin the narrative introduction. If the medical findings needed to supporta diagnosis are not given in the introduction or elsewhere in the Listing,the diagnosis must still be established on the basis of medically acceptableclinical and laboratory techniques. Following the introduction in eachsection, the required level of severity of impairment is shown under ``Categoryof Impairments'' by one or more sets of medical findings. The medical findingsconsist of symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings. (d) <T3>Diagnosis of Impairments. </T3>The Board will not consider the claimant'simpairment to be one listed in Appendix I of this part solely because ithas the diagnosis of a listed impairment. It must also have the findingsshown in the Listing of that impairment. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.111 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Medical equivalence. </ITAG>(a) <T3>How medical equivalence is determined. </T3>The Board will decide thatthe claimant's impairment(s) is medically equivalent to a listed impairmentin Appendix I of this part if the medical findings are at least equal inseverity and duration to the listed findings. The Board compares the symptoms,signs, and laboratory findings about the claimant's impairment(s), as shownin the medical evidence in his or her claim, with the medical criteriashown with the listed impairment. If the claimant's impairment is not listed,the Board will consider the listed impairment most like the claimant'simpairment to decide whether his or her impairment is medically equal.If the claimant has more than one impairment, and none of them meets orequals a listed impairment, the Board will review the symptoms, signs,and laboratory findings about the claimant's impairments to determine whetherthe combination of his or her impairments is medically equal to any listedimpairment. (b) <T3>Medical equivalence must be based on medical findings. </T3>The Boardwill base its decision about whether the claimant's impairment(s) is medicallyequal to a listed impairment on medical evidence only. Any medical findingsin the evidence must be supported by medically acceptable clinical andlaboratory diagnostic techniques. The Board will also consider the medicalopinion given by one or more physicians employed or engaged by the Boardor the Social Security Administration to make medical judgments. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.112 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Conclusions by physicians concerning the claimant's disability. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Under the statute, the Board is responsible for makingthe decision about whether a claimant meets the statutory definition ofdisability. A claimant can only be found disabled if he or she is unableto do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinablephysical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in deathor which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous periodof not less than 12 months. (See andSection;220.28). A claimant's impairmentmust result from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalitieswhich are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratorydiagnostic techniques. (See andSection; 220.27). Except in cases of remarriedwidows, widowers, and surviving divorced spouses, the decision as to whethera claimant is disabled may involve more than medical considerations andthe Board may have to consider such factors as age, education, and pastwork experience. Such vocational factors are not within the expertise ofmedical sources.(b) <T3>Medical opinions that are conclusive. </T3>A medical opinion by a treatingsource will be conclusive as to the medical issues of the nature and severityof a claimant's impairment(s) where the Board finds that (1) it is fullysupported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniquesand (2) it is not inconsistent with the other substantial medical evidenceof record. A medical opinion that is not fully supported will not be conclusive.(c) <T3>Medical opinions that are not fully supported. </T3>If an opinion bya treating source(s) is not fully supported, the Board will make everyreasonable effort (i.e., an initial request and, after 20 days, one followuprequest) to obtain from the claimant's treating source(s) the relevantevidence that supports the medical opinion(s) before the Board makes adetermination as to whether a claimant is disabled.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example: </T4>In a case involving an organic mental disorder causedby trauma to the head a consultative physician upon interview with theclaimant found only mild disorientation as to time and place. The claimant'streating physician reports that the claimant as the result of his impairmenthas severe disorientation as to time and place. The treating physiciansupplies office notes which follow the course of claimant's illness fromdate of injury to present. These notes indicate that the claimant's conditionis such that he has some ``good days'' on which he appears to be unimpairedbut generally support the treating physician's opinion that claimant isseverely impaired. In this case the treating physician's opinion will begiven some weight over that of the consultative physician.</ITAG>(d) <T3>Inconsistent medical opinions. </T3>Where the Board finds that theopinion of a treating source regarding medical issues is inconsistent withthe evidence of record including opinions of other sources that are supportedby medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques,the Board must resolve the inconsistency. If necessary to resolve the inconsistency,the Board will secure additional independent evidence and/or further interpretationor explanation from the treating source(s) and/or the consultative physicianor psychologist. The Board's determination will be based on all the evidencein the case record, including the opinions of the medical sources. In resolvingan inconsistency, the Board will give some extra weight to the treatingsource's supported opinion(s) which interprets the medical findings aboutthe nature and severity of the impairment(s).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example: </T4>In a case involving arthritis of the shoulder, wherethe X-rays confirm bony destruction, the examinations indicate minimalswelling and inflammation, but the treating source supplies evidence ofgreater restriction in the range of motion than found by the consultativephysician, the Board will ask the treating source for further interpretationof the range of motion studies. If the treating source supplies a reasonableexplanation, e.g., that the individual's condition is subject to periodsof aggravation, the treating source's explanation will be given some extraweight over that of the consultative physician.</ITAG>(e) <T3>Medical opinions that will not be considered conclusive nor given extraweight. </T3>The Board will not consider as conclusive nor give extra weightto medical opinions which are not in accord with the statutory or regulatorystandards for establishing disability. Thus, opinions that the individual'simpairments meet the Listing of Impairments in Appendix 1 of this part,where the medical findings which are the basis for that conclusion wouldnot meet the specific criteria applicable to the particular impairmentas set out in the Listing, will not be conclusive nor given extra weight.Likewise, an opinion(s) as to the individual's residual functional capacitywhich is not in accord with regulatory requirements set forth in andSection;andSection;220.120 and 220.121 will not be conclusive nor given extra weight.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 1: </T4>A medical opinion that an impairment meets listing2.02, but the medical findings show that the individual's visual acuityin the better eye after best correction is 20/100, would not be conclusivenor would it be given extra weight since listing 2.02 requires that theremaining vision in the better eye after best correction be 20/200 or less.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 2: </T4>A medical opinion that the individual is limited tolight work when the evidence shows that he or she can lift a maximum of50 pounds and lift 25 pounds frequently will not be considered as conclusivenor given extra weight. This is because the individual's exertional capacityexceeds the criteria set forth in the regulations for light work.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.113 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings. </ITAG>Medical findings consist of symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings: (a) <T3>Symptoms </T3>are the claimant's own description of his or her physicalor mental impairment(s). The claimant's statements alone are not enoughto establish that there is a physical or mental impairment(s). (b) <T3>Signs </T3>are anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalitieswhich can be observed, apart from the claimant's own statements (symptoms).Signs must be shown by medically acceptable clinical diagnostic techniques.Psychiatric signs are medically demonstrable phenomena which indicate specificabnormalities of behavior, affect, thought, memory, orientation and contactwith reality. They must also be shown by obsevable facts that can be medicallydescribed and evaluated. (c) <T3>Laboratory findings </T3>are anatomical, physiological, or psychologicalphenomena which can be shown by the use of medically acceptable laboratorydiagnostic techniques. Some of these diagnostic techniques include chemicaltests, electrophysiological studies (electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram,etc.) x-rays, and psychological tests. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.114 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Evaluation of symptoms, including pain. </ITAG>The Board considers all of the claimant's symptoms, including pain, andthe extent to which signs and laboratory findings confirm these symptoms.The Board will not find the claimant disabled based on his or her symptomsunless medical signs or findings show a medical impairment that could bereasonably expected to produce those symptoms. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.115 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Need to follow prescribed treatment. </ITAG>(a) <T3>What treatment the claimant must follow. </T3>In order to get a disabilityannuity, the claimant must follow treatment prescribed by his or her physicianif this treatment can restore the claimant's ability to work. (b) <T3>When the claimant does not follow the prescribed treatment. </T3>Ifthe claimant does not follow prescribed treatment without a good reason,the Board will find him or her not disabled or, if the claimant is alreadyreceiving a disability annuity, the Board will stop paying the annuity.(c) <T3>Acceptable reasons for failure to follow prescribed treatment. </T3>Thefollowing are examples of a good reason for not following treatment: (1) The specific medical treatment is contrary to the established teachingand tenets of the claimant's religion. (2) The prescribed treatment would be cataract surgery for one eye, whenthere is an impairment of the other eye resulting in a severe loss of visionand is not subject to improvement through surgery. (3) Surgery was previously performed with unsuccessful results and thesame surgery is again being recommended for the same impairment. (4) The treatment because of its magnitude (e.g., open heart surgery),unusual nature (e.g., organ transplant), or other reason is very riskyfor the claimant. (5) The treatment involves amputation of an extremity, or a major partof an extremity. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart J_Residual Functional Capacity </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.120 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Residual functional capacity, defined. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>(1) The claimant's impairment(s) may cause physical andmental limitations that affect what the claimant can do in a work setting.Residual functional capacity is what the claimant can do despite his orher limitations. If the claimant has more than one impairment, the Boardwill consider all of his or her impairments of which the Board is aware.The Board considers the claimant's capacity for various functions as describedin the following paragraphs: (b) physical abilities, (c) mental impairments,and (d) other impairments. Residual functional capacity is a medical assessment.However, it may include descriptions (even the claimant's) of the limitationsthat go beyond the symptoms that are imprortant to diagnosis and treatmentof the claimant's medical impairment(s) and may include observations ofthe claimant's work limitations in addition to those usually made duringformal medical examinations. (2) The descriptions and observations of the limitations, when used, mustbe considered along with the rest of the claimant's medical records toenable the Board to decide to what extent the claimant's impairment(s)keep him or her from performing particular work activities. (3) The assessment of the claimant's residual functional capacity for workis not a decision on whether the claimant is disabled, but is used as thebasis for determining the particular types of work the claimant may beable to do despite his or her impairment(s). A claimant's vocational background(see andSection;andSection; 220.125 through 220.134) is considered along withhis or her residual functional capacity in arriving at a disability decision. (4) In deciding whether disability continues or ends, the residual functionalcapacity assessment may also be used to determine whether any medical improvementthe claimant's ability to work as discussed in andSection; 220.180. (b) <T3>Physical abilities.</T3> When the Board assesses the claimant's physicalabilities, the Board assesses the severity of his or her impairment(s)and determines his or her residual functional capacity for work activityon a regular and continuing basis. The Board considers the claimant's abilityto do physical activities such as walking, standing, lifting, carrying,pushing, pulling, reaching, handling, and the evaluation of other physicalfunctions. A limited ability to do these things may reduce the claimant'sability to do work. (c) <T3>Mental impairments.</T3> When the Board assesses a claimant's mentalimpairment(s), the Board considers the factors, such as_ (1) His or her ability to understand, to carry out, and remember instructions;and (2) His or her ability to respond appropriately to supervision, co-workers,and work pressures in a work setting. (d) <T3>Other impairments.</T3> Some medically determinable impairments, suchas skin impairments, epilepsy, and impairments of vision, hearing, or othersenses, postural and manipulative limitations, and environmental restrictionsdo not limit physical exertion. If the claimant has this type of impairment,in addition to one that affects physical exertion, the Board considersboth in deciding his or her residual functional capacity  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.121</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Responsibility for assessing and determining residual functional capacity.</ITAG>(a) For cases at the initial or reconsideration level, the responsibilityfor determining residual functional capacity rests with the bureau of retirementclaims. This assessment is based on all the evidence the Board has, includingany statements regarding what the claimant can still do that have beenprovided by treating or examining physicians, consultative physicians,or any other physican designated by the Board. In any case where thereis evidence which indicates the existence of a mental impairment, the bureauof retirement claims will not make a residual functional capacity determinationwithout making every reasonable effort to ensure that a qualified psychiatristor psychologist has provided a medical review of the case.(b) For cases at the hearing level or the three-member-Board review level,the responsibility for deciding residual functional capacity rests withthe appeals referee or the three-member-Board, respectively. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart K_Vocational Considerations </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.125</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">When vocational background is considered. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General.</T3> The Board will consider vocational factors when the claimantis applying for_ (1) An employee annuity based on disability for any regular employment(See andSection; 220.45(b)); (2) Widow(er) disability annuity; or (3) Child's disability annuity based on disability before age 22. (b) <T3>Disability determinations in which vocational factors must be consideredalong with medical evidence.</T3> When the Board cannot decide whetherthe claimant is disabled on medical evidence alone, the Board must useother evidence. (1) The Board will use information from the claimant about his or her age,education, and work experience. (2) The Board will consider the doctors' reports, and hospital records,as well as the claimant's own statements and other evidence to determinea claimant's residual functional capacity and how it affects the work theclaimant can do. Sometimes, to do this, the Board will need to ask theclaimant to have special examinations or tests. (See andSection; 220.50.)(3) If the Board finds that the claimant can no longer do the work he orshe has done in the past, the Board will determine whether the claimantcan do other work (jobs) which exist in significant numbers in the nationaleconomy. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.126</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Relationship of ability to do work and residual functional capacity.</ITAG>(a) If the claimant can do his or her previous work (his or her usual workor other applicable past work), the Board will determine he or she is notdisabled. (b) If the residual functional capacity is not enough for the claimantto do any of his or her previous work, the Board must still decide if theclaimant can do any other work. To determine whether the claimant can doother work, the Board will consider the claimant's residual functionalcapacity, and has or her age, education, and work experience. Any work(jobs) that the claimant can do must exist in significant numbers in thenational economy (either in the region where he or she lives or in severalregions of the country). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.127</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">When the only work experience is arduous unskilled physical labor.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Arduous work.</T3> Arduous work is primarily physical work requiringa high level of strength or endurance. The Board will consider the claimantunable to do lighter work and therefore, disabled if he or she has_ (1) A marginal education (see andSection; 220.129); (2) Work experience of 35 years or more during which he or she did arduousunskilled physical labor; and (3) A severe impairment which no longer allows him or her to do arduousunskilled physical labor. (b) <T3>Exceptions.</T3> The Board may consider the claimant not disabled if_(1) The claimant is working or has worked despite his or her impairment(s)(except where work is sporadic or not medically advisable); or (2) Evidence shows that the claimant has training or past work experiencewhich enables him or her to do substantial gainful activity in anotheroccupation with his or her impairment, either full-time or on reasonablyregular part-time basis.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example:</T4> B is a 60-year-old miner with a fourth grade educationwho has a life-long history of arduous physical labor. B says that he isdisabled because of arthritis of the spine, hips, and knees, and otherimpairments. Medical evidence shows a combination of impairments and establishesthat these impairments prevent B from performing his usual work or anyother type of arduous physical labor. His vocational background does notshow that he has skills or capabilities needed to do ligher work whichwould be readily transferable to another work setting. Under these circumstances,the Board will find that B is disabled. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.128</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Age as a vocational factor. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General.</T3> (1) ``Age'' refers to how old the claimant is (chronologicalage) and the extent to which his or her age affects his or her abilityto_ (1) Adapt to a new work situation; and (ii) Do work in competition with others. (2) In determining disability, the Board does not consider age alone. TheBoard must also consider the claimant's residual functional capacity, education,and work experience. If the claimant is unemployed because of his or herage and can still do a significant number of jobs which exist in the nationaleconomy, the Board will find that he or she is not disabled. Appendix 2of this part explains in detail how the Board considers age as a vocationalfactor. However, the Board does not apply these age categories mechanicallyin a borderline situation. (b) <T3>Younger person.</T3> If the claimant is under age 50, the Board generallydoes not consider that his or her age will seriously affect the abilityto adapt to a new work situation. In some circumstances, the Board considersage 45 a handicap in adapting to a new work setting (see Rule 201.17 inAppendix 2 of this Part.) (c) <T3>Person approaching advanced age.</T3> If the claimant is closely approachingadvanced age (50-54), the Board considers that the claimant's age, alongwith a severe impairment and limited work experience, may seriously affectthe claimant's ability to adjust to a significant number of jobs in thenational economy.  (d) <T3>Person of advanced age.</T3> The Board considers that advanced age(55 or over) is the point at which age significantly affects the claimant'sability to do substantial gainful activity. (1) If the claimant is severely impaired and of advanced age, and he orshe cannot do medium work (see andSection; 220.132), the claimant may notbe able to work unless he or she has skills that can be used in less demandingjobs which exist in significant numbers in the national economy.(2) If the claimant is close to retirement age (60-64) and has a severeimpairment, the Board will not consider him or her able to adjust to sedentaryor light work unless the claimant has skills which are highly marketable.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.129</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Education as a vocational factor.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>``Education'' is primarily used to mean formal schoolingor other training which contributes to the claimant's ability to meet vocationalrequirements, for example, reasoning ability, communication skills, andarithmetical ability. If the claimant does not have formal schooling, thisdoes not necessarily mean that the claimant is uneducated or lacks theseabilities. Past work experience and the kinds of responsibilities the claimanthad when he or she was working may show that he or she has intellectualabilities, although the claimant may have little formal education. A claimant'sdaily activities, hobbies, or the results of testing may also show thatthe claimant has significant intellectual ability that can be used to work.(b) <T3>How the Board evaluates the claimant's education. </T3>(1) The importanceof the claimant's educational background may depend upon how much timehas passed between the completion of the claimant's formal education andthe beginning of the claimant's physical or mental impairment(s) and whatthe claimant has done with his or her education in a work or other setting.Formal education completed many years before the claimant's impairment(s)began, or unused skills and knowledge that were a part of the claimant'sformal education, may no longer be useful or meaningful in terms of abilityto work. Therefore, the numerical grade level that the claimant completedin school may not represent his or her actual educational abilities. Theseeducational abilities may be higher or lower than the numerical grade levelthat the claimant completed. However, if there is no other evidence tocontradict it, the Board uses the claimant's numerical grade level to determinethe claimant's educational abilities. The term ``education'' also includeshow well the claimant is able to communicate in English since this abilityis often acquired or improved by education. In evaluating the claimant'seducational level, the Board uses the following categories:(1) <T3>Illiteracy. </T3>Illiteracy means the inability to read or write. TheBoard will consider the claimant illiterate if he or she cannot read orwrite a simple message such as instructions or inventory lists even thoughthe claimant can sign his or her name. Generally, the illiterate claimanthas had little or no formal schooling.(2) <T3>Marginal education. </T3>Marginal education means ability in reasoning,arithmetic, and language skills which are needed to do simple, unskilledtypes of jobs. Generally, this means a 6th grade or less level of education.(3) <T3>Limited education. </T3>Limited education means ability in reasoning,arithmetic, and language skills, but not enough to allow a person withthese educational qualifications to do most of the more complex dutiesneeded in semi-skilled or skilled jobs. Generally, a limited educationis a 7th grade through 11th grade level of education.(4) <T3>High school education and above. </T3>High school and above means abilitiesin reasoning, arithmetic, and language skills acquired through formal schoolingat a 12th grade level or above. The claimant with this level of educationis generally considered able to do semi-skilled through skilled work.(5) <T3>Inability to communicate in English. </T3>Since the ability to speak,read, and understand English is generally learned or increased at school,the Board may consider this an educational factor. Because English is thedominant language of the country, it may be difficult for the claimantwho does not speak and understand English to do a job, regardless of theamount of education he or she may have in another language. The claimant'sability to speak, read and understand English will be considered when theBoard evaluates what work, if any, he or she can do.(6) <T3>Information about the claimant's education. </T3>The Board will askthe claimant how long he or she attended school and whether he or she canspeak, understand, read and write in English, and do at least simple calculationsin arithmetic. The Board will also consider information about how muchformal or informal education the claimant received from his or her previouswork, community projects, hobbies and any other activities which mighthelp him or her to work.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.130</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Work experience as a vocational factor.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>``Work experience'' means skills and abilities the claimanthas acquired through work he or she has done which show the type of workhe or she may be expected to do. Work the claimant has already been ableto do shows the kind of work that he or she may be expected to do. TheBoard considers that the claimant's work experience is relevant and applieswhen it was done within the last 15 years, lasted long enough for him orher to learn to do it, and was substantial gainful activity. This workexperience is called ``past relevant work.'' The Board does not usuallyconsider that work the claimant did 15 years or more before the time theBoard is deciding whether he or she is disabled (or when the disabilityinsured status requirement was last met, if earlier) applies. A gradualchange occurs in most jobs so that after 15 years, it is no longer realisticto expect that skills and abilities acquired in a job done then continueto apply. The 15-year guide is intended to insure that remote work experienceis not currently applied. If the claimant has no work experience or workedonly ``off-and-on'' or for brief periods of time during the 15-year period,the Board generally considers that these do not apply. If the claimanthas acquired skills through his or her past work, the Board considers theclaimant to have these work skills unless he or she cannot use them inother skilled or semi-skilled work that he or she can do. If the claimantcannot use his or her skills in other skilled or semi-skilled work, theBoard will consider his or her work background the same as unskilled. However,even if the claimant has no work experience, the Board may consider thatthe claimant is able to do unskilled work because it requires little orno judgment and can be learned in a short period of time.(b) <T3>Information about the claimant's work. </T3>(1) Sometimes the Boardwill need information about the claimant's past work to make a disabilitydetermination. The Board may request work information from_(i) The claimant; and(ii) The claimant's employer or other person who knows about the claimant'swork (member of family or co-worker) with the claimant's permission.(2) The Board will ask for the following information about all the jobsthe claimant has had in the last 15 years:(i) The dates the claimant worked.(ii) All the duties the claimant did.(iii) Any tools, machinery, and equipment the claimant used.(iv) The amount of walking, standing, sitting, lifting and carrying theclaimant did during the work day, as well as any other physical and mentalduties of the job.(3) If all the claimant's work in the past 15 years has been arduous andunskilled, and the claimant has very little education, the Board will askthe claimant to tell about all of his or her work from the time he or shefirst began working. (See andSection; 220.45(b).)<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.131</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Work which exists in the national economy.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>The Board considers that work exists in the nationaleconomy when it exists in significant numbers either in the region wherethe claimant lives or in several other regions of the country. It doesnot matter whether_(1) Work exists in the immediate area in which the claimant lives,(2) A specific job vacancy exists for the claimant; or(3) The claimant would be hired if the claimant applied for work.(b) <T3>How the Board determines the existence of work.</T3> Work exists inthe national economy when there is a significant number of jobs (in oneor more occupations) having requirements which the claimant is able tomeet with his or her physical or mental ability and vocational qualifications.Isolated jobs that exist in very limited numbers in relatively few locationsoutside the region where the claimant lives are not considered ``work whichexists in the national economy.'' The Board will not deny the claimanta disability annuity on the basis of the existence of these kinds of jobs.The Board will determine that the claimant is disabled if the work he orshe can do does not exist in the national economy. If the work the claimantcan do does exist in the national economy, the Board will determine thatthe claimant is not disabled. (c) <T3>Inability to obtain work.</T3> The Board will determine that the claimantis not disabled if he or she has the residual functional capacity and vocationalabilities to do work which exists in the national economy but the claimantremains unemployed because of_ (1) His or her inability to get work; (2) Lack of work in his or her local area; (3) The hiring practices of employers; (4) Technological changes in the industry in which the claimant has worked;(5) Cyclical economic conditions; (6) No job openings for the claimant; (7) The claimant not actually being hired to do work he or she could otherwisedo; or (8) The claimant not wishing to do a particular type of work. (d) <T3>Administrative notice of job data.</T3> The following sources are usedwhen the Board determines that unskilled, sedentary, light and medium jobsexist in the national economy:(1) <T3>Dictionary of Occupational Titles,</T3> published by the Departmentof Labor. (2) <T3>County Business Patterns,</T3> published by the Bureau of the Census.(3) <T3>Census Reports,</T3> also published by the Bureau of the Census. (4) <T3>Occupational Analyses,</T3> prepared for the Social Security Administrationby various State employment agencies. (5) <T3>Occupational Outlook Handbook,</T3> published by the Bureau of LaborStatistics.(e) <T3>Use of vocational experts and other specialists.</T3> If the issuein determining whether the claimant is disabled is whether his or her workskills can be used in other work and the specific occupations in whichthey can be used, or there is a similarly complex issue, the Board mayuse the services of a vocational expert or other specialist. The Boardwill decide whether to use a vocational expert or other specialist. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.132 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Physical exertion requirements. </ITAG>To determine the physical exertion requirements of work in the nationaleconomy, jobs are classified as ``sedentary'', ``light'', ``medium'', ``heavy'',and ``very heavy.'' These terms have the same meaning as they have in theDictionary of Occupational Titles, published by the Department of Labor.In making disability determinations the Board uses the following definitions:(a) <T3>Sedentary work.</T3> Sedentary work involves lifting no more than 10pounds at a time and occastionally lifting or carrying articles like docketfiles, ledgers, and small tools. Although a sedentary job is defined asone which involves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing isoften necessary in carrying out job duties. Jobs are sedentary if walkingand standing are required occasionally and the other sedentary criteriaare met. (b) <T3>Light work.</T3> Light work involves lifting no more than 20 poundsat a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be very little, a job is in thiscategory when it requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when itinvolves sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of armor leg controls. To be considered capable of performing a full or widerange of light work, the claimant must have the ability to do substantiallyall of these activities. If the claimant can do light work, the Board determinesthat he or she can also do sedentary work, unless there are additionallimiting factors such as loss of fine dexterity or inability to sit forlong periods of time. (c) <T3>Medium work.</T3> Medium work involves lifting no more than 50 poundsat a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 25pounds. If the claimant can do medium work, the Board determines that heor she can also do sedentary and light work. (d) <T3>Heavy work.</T3> Heavy work involves lifting no more than 100 poundsat a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 50pounds. If the claimant can do heavy work, the Board determines that heor she can also do medium, light, and sedentary work.  (e) <T3>Very heavy work.</T3> Very heavy work involves lifting objects weighingmore than 100 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objectsweighing 50 pounds or more. If the claimant can do very heavy work, theBoard determines that he or she can also do heavy, medium, light and sedentarywork. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.133 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Skill requirements. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General.</T3> To evaluate skills and to help determine the existencein the national economy of work the claimant is able to do, occupationsare classified as unskilled, semi-skilled, and skilled. In classifyingthese occupations, the Board uses materials published by the Departmentof Labor. (b) <T3>Unskilled work.</T3> Unskilled work is work which needs little or nojudgment to do simple duties that can be learned on the job in a shortperiod of time (30 days). The job may or may not require considerable strength.A job is considered unskilled if the claiment can usually learn to do thejob in 30 days, and little job training and judgment are needed. The claimantdoes not gain work skills by doing unskilled jobs. For example, jobs areconsidered unskilled if primary work duties are_ (1) Handling; (2) Feeding; (3) Offbearing (placing or removing materials from machines which are automaticor operated by others; or (4) Machine tending. (c) <T3>Semi-skilled work.</T3> Semi-skilled work is work which needs someskills but does not require doing the more complex work duties. A job maybe classified as semi-skilled where coordination and dexterity are necessary,as when hand or feet must be moved quickly to do repetitive tasks. Semi-skilledjobs may require_ (1) Alertness and close attention to watching machine processes; (2) Inspecting, testing, or otherwise looking for irregularities; (3) Tending or guarding equipment, property, materials, or persons againstloss, damage, or injury; or (4) Other types of activities which are similarly less complex than skilledwork but more complex than unskilled work. (d) <T3>Skilled work.</T3> Skilled work requires qualifications in which aperson uses judgment to determine the machine and manual operations tobe performed in order to obtain the proper form, quality, or quantity ofmaterial to be produced. Skilled jobs may require_ (1) Laying out work; (2) Estimating quality; (3) Determining suitability and needed quantities of materials; (4) Making precise measurements; (5) Reading blueprints or other specifications; (6) Making necessary computations or mechanical adjustments to controlor regulate work; or (7) Dealing with people, facts, figures or abstract ideas at a high levelof complexity. (e) <T3>Skills that can be used in other work (transferability)_</T3>(1) <T3>What the Board means by transferable skills. </T3>The Board considersthe claimant to have skills that can be used in other jobs, when the skilledor semi-skilled work activities the claimant did in past work can be usedto meet the requirements of skilled or semi-skilled work activities ofother jobs or kinds of work. This depends largely on the similarity ofoccupationally significant work activities among different jobs.  (2) <T3>How the Board determines skills that can be transferred to other jobs.</T3>Transferability is most probable and meaningful among jobs in which_ (i) The same or a lesser degree of skill is required;  (ii) The same or similar tools and machines are used; and  (iii) The same or similar raw materials, products, processes, or servicesare involved.  (3) <T3>Degrees of transferability. </T3>There are degrees of transferabilityof skills ranging from very close similarities to remote and incidentalsimilarities among jobs. A complete similarity of all three factors isnot necessary for transferability. However, when skills are so specializedor have been acquired in such an isolated vocational setting (like manyjobs in mining, agriculture, or fishing) that they are not readily usablein other industries, jobs, and work settings, they are considered not transferable. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.134  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Medical Vocational Guidelines in Appendix 2 of this part.  </ITAG>(a) The Dictionary of Occupational Titles includes information about jobs(classified by their exertional and skill requirements) that exist in thenational economy. Appendix 2 of this part provides rules using this datareflecting major functional and vocational patterns.  (b) The Board applies the rules in appendix 2 of this part in cases wherea claimant is not doing substantial gainful activity and is prevented bya severe impairment(s) from doing vocationally relevant past work.  (c) The rules in Appendix 2 of this part do not cover all possible variationsof factors. The Board does not apply these rules if one of the findingsof fact about the claimant's vocational factors and residual functionalcapacity is not the same as the corresponding criterion of a rule. In theseinstances, the Board gives full consideration to all relevant facts inaccordance with the definitions and discussions under vocational considerations.However, if the findings of fact made about all factors are the same asthe rule, the Board uses that rule to decide whether that claimant is disabled. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart L_Substantial Gainful Activity  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.140  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General.  </ITAG>The work that a claimant has done during any period in which the claimantbelieves he or she is disabled may show that the claimant is able to dowork at the substantial gainful activity level. If the claimant is ableto engage in substantial gainful activity, the Board will find that theclaimant is not disabled for any regular employment under the RailroadRetirement Act. Even if the work the claimant has done was not substantialgainful activity, it may show that the claimant is able to do more workthan he or she actually did. The Board will consider all of the medicaland vocational evidence in the claimant's file to decide whether or notthe claimant has the ability to enagage in substantial gainful activity. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.141 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Substantial gainful activity, defined.  </ITAG>Substantial gainful activity is work activity that is both substantialand gainful.  (a) <T3>Substantial work activity. </T3>Substantial work activity is work activitythat involves doing significant physical or mental activities. The claimant'swork may be substantial even if it is done on a part-time basis or if theclaimant does less, gets paid less, or has less responsibility than whenthe claimant worked before.  (b) <T3>Gainful work activity. </T3>Gainful work activity is work activitythat the claimant does for pay or profit. Work activity is gainful if itis the kind of work usually done for pay or profit, whether or not a profitis realized  (c) <T3>Some other activities. </T3>Generally, the Board does not consideractivities like taking care of one's self, household tasks, hobbies, therapy,school attendance, club activities, or social programs to be substantialgainful activity.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.142  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General Information about work activity.  </ITAG>(a) <T3>The nature of the claimant's work. </T3>If the claimant's duties requireuse of the claimant's experience, skills, supervision and responsibilities,or contribute substantially to the operation of a business, this tendsto show that the claimant has the ability to work at the substantial gainfulactivity level.  (b) <T3>How well the claimant performs. </T3>The Board considers how well theclaimant does his or her work when the Board determines whether or notthe claimant is doing substantial gainful activity. If the claimant doeshis or her work satisfactorily, this may show that the claimant is workingat the substantial gainful activity level. If the claimant is unable, becauseof his or her impairments, to do ordinary or simple tasks satisfactorilywithout more supervision or assistance than is usually given other peopledoing similar work, this may show that the claimant is not working at thesubstantial gainful activity level. If the claimant is doing work thatinvolves minimal duties that make little or no demands on the claimantand that are of little or no use to the claimant's railroad or non-railroademployer, or to the operation of a business if the claimant is self-employed,this does not show that the claimant is working at the substantial gainfulactivity level.      (c) <T3>If the claimant's work is done under special conditions.</T3> Eventhough the work the claimant is doing takes into account his or her impairment,such as work done in a sheltered workshop or as a patient in a hospital,it may still show that the claimant has the necessary skills and abilityto work at the substantial gainful activity level.(d) <T3>If the claimant is self-employed</T3>. Supervisory, managerial, advisoryor other significant personal services that the claimant performs as aself-employed person may show that the claimant is able to do substantialgainful activity.(e) <T3>Time spent in work</T3>. While the time the claimant spends in workis important, the Board will not decide whether or not the claimant isdoing substantial gainful activity only on that basis. The Board will stillevaluate the work to decide whether it is substantial and gainful regardlessof whether the claimant spends more time or less time at the job than workerswho are not impaired and who are doing similar work as a regular meansof their livelihood.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.143</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Evaluation guides for an employed claimant.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General</T3>. The Board uses several guides to decide whether the workthe claimant has done shows that he or she is able to do substantial gainfulactivity.(1) <T3>The claimant's earnings may show the claimant has done substantialgainful activity</T3>. The amount of the claimant's earnings from workthe claimant has done may show that he or she has engaged in substantialgainful activity. Generally, if the claimant worked for substantial earnings,this will show that he or she is able to do substantial gainful activity.On the other hand, the fact that the claimant's earnings are not substantialwill not necessarily show that the claimant is not able to do substantialgainful activity. The Board will generally consider work that the claimantis forced to stop after a short time because of his or her impairment(s)as an unsuccessful work attempt and the claimant's earnings from that workwill not show that the claimant is able to do substantial gainful activity.(2) <T3>The Board considers only the amounts the claimant earns</T3>. The Boarddoes not consider any income not directly related to the claimant's productivitywhen the Board decides whether the claimant has done substantial gainfulactivity. If the claimant's earnings are subsidized, the amount of thesubsidy is not counted when the Board determines whether or not the claimant'swork is substantial gainful activity. Thus, where work is done under specialconditions, the Board only considers the part of the claimant's pay whichthe claimant actually ``earns.'' For example, where a handicapped persondoes simple tasks under close and continuous supervision, the Board wouldnot determine that the person worked at the substantial gainful activitylevel only on the basis of the amount of pay. A railroad or non-railroademployer may set a specific amount as a subsidy after figuring the reasonablevalue of the employee's services. If the claimant's work is subsidizedand the claimant's railroad and non-railroad employer does not set theamount of the subsidy or does not adequately explain how the subsidy wasfigured, the Board will investigate to see how much the claimant's workis worth.(3) <T3>If the claimant is working in a sheltered or special environment</T3>.If the claimant is working in a sheltered workshop, the claimant may ormay not be earning the amounts he or she is being paid. The fact that thesheltered workshop or similar facility is operating at a loss or is receivingsome charitable contributions or governmental aid does not establish thatthe claimant is not earning all he or she is being paid. Since personsin military service being treated for a severe impairment usually continueto receive full pay, the Board evaluates work activity in a therapy programor while on limited duty by comparing it with similar work in the civilianwork force or on the basis of reasonable worth of the work, rather thanon the actual amount of the earnings.(b) <T3>Earnings guidelines</T3>_(1) <T3>General.</T3> If the claimant is employed, the Board first considersthe criteria in paragraph (a) of this section and andSection; 220.145, andthen the guides in paragraphs (b) (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section.(2) <T3>Earnings that will ordinarily show that the claimant has engaged insubstantial gainful activity</T3>. The Board will consider that the earningsfrom the employed claimant's work activities show that the claimant hasengaged in substantial gainful activity if_(i) The claimant's earnings averaged more than $200 a month in calendaryears prior to 1976;(ii) The claimant's earnings averaged more than $230 a month in calendaryears prior to 1976;(iii) The claimant's earnings averaged more than $240 a month in calendaryear 1977;(iv) The claimant's earnings averaged more than $260 a month in calendaryear 1978;(v) The claimant's earnings averaged more than $280 a month in calendaryear 1979; or(vi) The claimant's earnings averaged more than $300 a month in calendaryears after 1979.(3) <T3>Earnings that will ordinarily show that the claimant has not engagedin substantial gainful activity</T3>. The Board will generally considerthat the earnings from the employed claimant's work will show that theclaimant has not engaged in substantial gainful activity if_(i) The claimant's earnings averaged less than $130 a month in calendaryear before 1976;(ii) The claimant's earnings averaged less than $150 a month in calendaryear 1976;(iii) The claimant's earnings averaged less than $160 a month in calendaryear 1977;(iv) The claimant's earnings averaged less than $170 a month in calendaryear 1978;(v) The claimant's earnings averaged less than $180 a month in calendaryear 1979; or(vi) The claimant's earnings averaged less than $190 a month in calendaryears after 1979.(4) <T3>If the claimant works in a sheltered workshop</T3>. If the claimantis working in a sheltered workshop or a comparable facility especiallyset up for severely impaired persons, the claimant's earnings and activitieswill ordinarily establish that the claimant has not done substantial gainfulactivity if_(i) The claimant's average earnings are not greater than $200 a month incalendar years prior to 1976;(ii) The claimant's average earnings are not greater than $230 a monthin calendar year 1976;(iii) The claimant's average earnings are not greater than $240 a monthin calendar year 1977;(iv) The claimant's average earnings are not greater than $260 a monthin calendar year 1978;(v) The claimant's average earnings are not greater than $280 a month incalendar year 1979; or(vi) The claimant's average earnings are not greater than $300 a monthin calendar year after 1979.(5) <T3>If there is evidence showing that the claimant may have done substantialgainful activity. </T3>If there is evidence showing that the claimant mayhave done substantial gainful activity, the Board will apply the criteriain paragraph (b)(6) of this section regarding comparability and value ofservices.(6) <T3>Earnings that are not high or low enough to show whether the claimantengaged in substantial gainful activity</T3>. If the claimant's earnings,on the average, are between the amounts shown in paragraphs (b) (2) and(3) of this section, the Board will generally consider other informationin addition to the claimant's earnings, such as whether_ (i) The claimant's work is comparable to that of unimpaired persons inthe claimant's community who are doing the same or similar occupationsas their means of livelihood, taking into account the time, energy, skill,and responsibility involved in the work; or(ii) The claimant's work, although significantly less than that done byunimpaired persons, is clearly worth the amounts shown in paragraph (b)(2)of this section, according to pay scales in the claimant's community.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.144 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Evaluation guides for a self-employed claimant.</ITAG>(a) <T3>If the claimant is a self-employed claimant. </T3>The Board will considerthe claimant's activities and their value to the claimant's business todecide whether the claimant has engaged in substantial gainful activityif the claimant is self-employed. The Board will not consider the claimant'sincome alone since the amount of income the claimant actually receivesmay depend upon a number of different factors like capital investment,profit sharing agreements, etc. The Board will generally consider workthat the claimant is forced to stop after a short time because of his orher impairment(s) as an unsuccessful work attempt and the claimant's incomefrom that work will not show that the claimant is able to do substantialgainful activity. The Board will evaluate the claimant's work activityon the value to the business of the claimant's services regardless of whetherthe claimant receives an immediate income for his or her services. TheBoard considers that the claimant has engaged in substantial gainful activityif_(1) The claimant's work activity, in terms of factors such as hours, skills,energy output, efficiency, duties, and responsibilities, is comparableto that of unimpaired persons in the claimant's community who are in thesame or similar businesses as their means of livelihood; (2) The claimant's work activity, although not comparable to that of unimpairedpersons, is clearly worth the amount shown in andSection; 220.143 (b)(2)when considered in terms of its value to the business, or when comparedto the salary that an owner would pay to an employed person to do the workthe claimant is doing; or(3) The claimant renders services that are significant to the operationof the business and receives a substantial income from the business.(b) <T3>What the Board means by significant services</T3>_(1) <T3>Claimants who are not farm landlords. </T3>If the claimant is not afarm landlord and the claimant operates a business entirely by himselfor herself, any services that the claimant renders are significant to thebusiness. If the claimant's business involves the services of more thanone person, the Board will consider the claimant to be rendering significantservices if he or she contributes more than half the total time requiredfor the management of the business or he or she renders management servicesfor more than 45 hours a month regardless of the total management timerequired by the business.(2) <T3>Claimants who are farm landlords</T3>_ (i) <T3>General</T3>. If the claimant is a farm landlord, that is, the claimantrents farm land to another, the Board will consider the claimant to berendering significant services if the claimant materially participatesin the production or the management of the production of the things raisedon the rented farm. If the claimant was given social security earningscredits because he or she materially participated in the activities ofthe farm and he or she continues these same activities, the Board willconsider the claimant to be rendering significant services.(ii) <T3>Material participation. </T3>(A) The claimant will have establishedthat he or she is materially participating if he or she_(<T3>1</T3>) Furnishes a large portion of the machinery, tools, and livestockused in the production of the things raised on the rented farm; or(<T3>2</T3>) Furnishes or advances monies or assumes financial responsibilityfor a substantial part of the expense involved in the production of thethings raised on the rented farm.(B) The claimant will have presented strong evidence that he or she ismaterially participating if he or she periodically_(<T3>1</T3>) Advises or consults with the other person, who under the rentalagreement produces the things raised on the rented farm; and (<T3>2</T3>) Inspects the production activities on the land.(iii) <T3>Production</T3>. The term ``production'' refers to the physical workperformed and the expenses incurred in producing the things raised on thefarm. It includes activities like the actual work of planting, cultivating,and harvesting of crops, and the furnishing of machinery, implements, seed,and livestock. (iv) <T3>Management of the production. </T3>The term ``management of the production''refers to services performed in making managerial decisions about the productionof the crop, such as when to plant, cultivate, dust, spray or harvest.It includes advising and consulting, making inspections, and making decisionson matters, such as rotation of crops, the type of crops to be grown, thetype of livestock to be raised, and the type of machinery and implementsto be furnished.(c) <T3>What the Board means by substantial income. </T3>After the claimant'snormal business expenses are deducted from the claimant's gross incometo determine net income, the Board will deduct the reasonable value ofany unpaid help, any soil bank payments that were included as farm income,and impairment-related work expenses described in andSection; 220.145 thathave not been deducted in determining the claimant's net earnings fromself-employment. The Board will consider the resulting amount of incomefrom the business to be substantial if_(1) It averages more than the amounts described in andSection; 220.143(b)(2);or(2) It averages less than the amounts described in andSection; 220.143(b)(2)but the livelihood which the claimant gets from the business is eithercomparable to what it was before the claimant became severely impairedor is comparable to that of unimpaired self-employed persons in the claimant'scommunity who are in the same or similar businesses as their means of livelihood.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.145 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Impairment-related work expenses.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General.</T3> When the Board figures the claimant's earnings in decidingif the claimant has done substantial gainful activity, the Board will subtractthe reasonable costs to the claimant of certain items and services which,because of his or her impairment(s), the claimant needs and uses to enablehim or her to work. The costs are deductible even though the claimant alsoneeds or uses the items and services to carry out daily living functionsunrelated to his or her work. Paragraph (b) of this section explains theconditions for deducting work expenses. Paragraph (c) of this section describesthe expenses the Board will deduct. Paragraph (d) of this section explainswhen expenses may be deducted. Paragraph (e) of this section describeshow expenses may be allocated. Paragraph (f) of this section explains thelimitations on deducting expenses. Paragraph (g) of this section explainsthe Board's verification procedures.(b) <T3>Conditions for deducting impairment-related work expenses.</T3> TheBoard will deduct impariment-related work expenses if_(1) The claimant is otherwise disabled as defined in andSection;220.26;(2) The severity of the claimant's impairment(s) requires the claimantto purchase (or rent) certain items and services in order to work;(3) The claimant pays the cost of the item or service. No deduction willbe allowed to the extent that payment has been or will be made by anothersource. No deduction will be allowed to the extent that the claimant hasbeen, could be, or will be reimbursed for such cost by any other source(such as through a private insurance plan, Medicare or Medicaid, or otherplan or agency). For example, if the claimant purchases crutches for $80but the claimant was, could be, or will be reimbursed $64 by some agency,plan, or program, the Board will deduct only $16;(4) The claimant pays for the item or service in a month he or she is working(in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section); and(5) The claimant's payment is in cash (including checks or other formsof money). Payment in kind is not deductible.(c) <T3>What expenses may be deducted_</T3>(1) <T3>Payments for attendant care services.</T3> (i) If because of the claimant'simpairment(s) the claimant needs assistance in travelling to and from work,or while at work the claimant needs assistance with personal functions(e.g., eating, toileting) or with work-related functions (e.g., reading,communicating), the payments the claimant makes for those services maybe deducted.(ii) If because of the claimant's impairment(s) the claimant needs assistancewith personal functions (e.g., dressing, administering medications) athome in preparation for going to and assistance in returning from work,the payments the claimant makes for those services may be deducted.(iii) (A) The Board will deduct payments the claimant makes to a familymember for attendant care services only if such person, in order to performthe services, suffers an economic loss by terminating his or her employmentor by reducing the number of hours he or she worked.(B) The Board considers a family member to be anyone who is related tothe claimant by blood, marriage or adoption, whether or not that personlives with the claimant.(iv) If only part of the claimant's payment to a person is for servicesthat come under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, theBoard will only deduct that part of the payment which is attributable tothose services. For example, an attendant gets the claimant ready for workand helps the claimant in returning from work, which takes about 2 hoursa day. The rest of the attendant's 8 hour day is spent cleaning the claimant'shouse and doing the claimant's laundry, etc. The Board would only deductone-fourth of the attendant's daily wages as an impairment-related workexpense.(2) <T3>Payment for medical devices.</T3> If the claimant's impairment(s) requiresthat the claimant utilize medical devices in order to work, the paymentsthe claimant makes for those devices may be deducted. As used in this subparagraph,medical devices include durable medical equipment which can withstand repeateduse, is customarily used for medical purposes, and is generally not usefulto a person in the absence of an illness or injury. Examples of durablemedical equipment are wheelchairs, hemodialysis equipment, canes, crutches,inhalators and pacemakers.(3) <T3>Payments for prosthetic devices.</T3> If the claimant's impairment(s)requires that the claimant utilize a prosthetic device in order to work,the payments the claimant makes for that device can be deducted. A prostheticdevice is that which replaces an internal body organ or external body part.Examples of prosthetic devices are artificial replacements of arms, legsand other parts of the body.(4) <T3>Payments for equipment</T3>_(i) <T3>Work-related equipment.</T3> If the claimant's impairment(s) requiresthat the claimant utilize special equipment in order to do his or her job,the payments the claimant makes for that equipment may be deducted. Examplesof work-related equipment are one-hand typewriters, vision aids, sensoryaids for the blind, telecommunication devices for the deaf and tools specificallydesigned to accommodate a person's impairment(s).(ii) <T3>Residential modifications.</T3> If the claimant's impairment(s) requiresthat the claimant make modifications to his or her residence, the locationof the claimant's place of work will determine if the cost of these modificationswill be deducted. If the claimant is employed away from home, only thecost of changes made outside of the claimant's home to permit the claimantto get to his or her means of transportation (e.g., the installation ofan exterior ramp for a wheelchair confined person or special exterior railingsor pathways for someone who requires crutches) will be deducted. Costsrelating to modifications of the inside of the claimant's home will notbe deducted. If the claimant works at home, the costs of modifying theinside of the claimant's home in order to create a working space to accommodatethe claimant's impairment(s) will be deducted to the extent that the changespertain specifically to the space in which the claimant works. Examplesof such changes are the enlargement of a doorway leading into the workspaceor modification of the workspace to accommodate problems in dexterity.However, if the claimant is self-employed at home, any cost deducted asa business expense cannot be deducted as an impairment-related work expense.(iii) <T3>Non-medical appliances and equipment.</T3> Expenses for appliancesand equipment which the claimant does not ordinarily use for medical purposesare generally not deductible. Examples of these items are portable roomheaters, air conditioners, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and electric aircleaners. However, expenses for such items may be deductible when unusualcircumstances clearly establish an impairment-related and medically verifiedneed for such an item because it is for the control of the claimant's disablingimpairment(s), thus enabling the claimant to work. To be considered essential,the item must be of such a nature that if it were not available to theclaimant there would be an immediate adverse impact on the claimant's abilityto function in his or her work activity. In this situation, the expenseis deductible whether the item is used at home or in the working place.An example would be the need for an electric air cleaner by a person withsevere respiratory disease who cannot function in a non-purified air environment.An item such as an exercycle is not deductible if used for general physicalfitness. If an exercycle is prescribed and used as necessary treatmentto enable the claimant to work, the Board will deduct payments the claimantmakes toward its cost.(5) <T3>Payments for drugs and medical services.</T3> (i) If the claimant mustuse drugs or medical services (including diagnostic procedures) to controlhis or her impairment(s) the payments the claimant makes for them may bededucted. The drugs or services must be prescribed (or utilized) to reduceor eliminate symptoms of the claimant's impairment(s) or to slow down itsprogression. The diagnostic procedures must be performed to ascertain howthe impairment(s) is progressing or to determine what type of treatmentshould be provided for the impairment(s).(ii) Examples of deductible drugs and medical services are anticonvulsantdrugs to control epilepsy or anticonvulsant blood level monitoring; antidepressantmedication for mental impairments; medication used to allay the side effectsof certain treatments; radiation treatment or chemotherapy for cancer patients;corrective surgery for spinal impairments; electroencephalograms and brainscans related to a disabling epileptic impairment; tests to determine theefficacy of medication on a diabetic condition; and immunosuppresive medicationsthat kidney transplant patients regularly take to protect against graftrejection. (iii) The Board will only deduct the costs of drugs or services that aredirectly related to the claimant's impairment(s). Examples of non-deductibleitems are routine annual physical examinations, optician services (unrelatedto a disabling visual impairment) and dental examinations. (6) <T3>Payments for similar items and services_</T3>(i) <T3>General. </T3>If the claimant is required to utilize items and servicesnot specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section, but whichare directly related to his or her impairment(s) and which the claimantneeds to work, their costs are deductible. Examples of such items and servicesare medical supplies and services not discussed above, the purchase andmaintenance of a dog guide which the claimant needs to work, and transportation.(ii) <T3>Medical supplies and services not described above. </T3>The Board willdeduct payments the claimant makes for expendable medical supplies, suchas incontinence pads, catheters, bandages, elastic stockings, face masks,irrigating kits, and disposable sheets and bags. The Board will also deductpayments the claimant makes for physical therapy which the claimant requiresbecause of his or her impairment(s) and which the claimant needs in orderto work. (iii) <T3>Payments for transportation costs. </T3>The Board will deduct transportationcosts in these situations: (A) The claimant's impairment(s) requires that in order to get to workthe claimant needs a vehicle that has structural or operational modifications.The modifications must be critical to the claimant's operation or use ofthe vehicle and directly related to the claimant's impairment(s). The Boardwill deduct the cost of the modifications, but not the cost of the vehicle.The Board will also deduct a mileage allowance for the trip to and fromwork. The allowance will be based on data compiled by the Federal HighwayAdministration relating to vehicle operating costs. (B) The claimant's impairment(s) requires the claimant to use driver assistance,taxicabs or other hired vehicles in order to work. The Board will deductamounts paid to the driver and, if the claimant's own vehicle is used,the Board will also deduct a mileage allowance, as provided in paragraph(c)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, for the trip to and from work. (C) The claimant's impairment(s) prevents the claimant from taking availablepublic transportation to and from work and the claimant must drive hisor her (unmodified) vehicle to work. If the Board can verify through theclaimant's physician or other sources that the need to drive is causedby the claimant's impairment(s) (and not due to the unavailability of publictransportation), the Board will deduct a mileage allowance, as providedin paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, for the trip to and from work.(7) <T3>Payments for installing, maintaining, and repairing deductible items.</T3>If the device, equipment, appliance, etc., that the claimant utilizesqualifies as a deductible item as described in paragraphs (c)(2), (3),(4) and (6) of this section, the costs directly related to installing,maintaining and repairing these items are also deductible. (The costs whichare associated with modifications to a vehicle are deductible. Except fora mileage allowance, as provided for in paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A) of thissection, the costs which are associated with the vehicle itself are notdeductible.) (d) <T3>When expenses may be deducted_</T3>(1) <T3>Effective date. </T3>To be deductible, an expense must be incurredafter November 30, 1980. An expense may be considered incurred after thatdate if it is paid thereafter even though pursuant to a contract or otherarrangement entered into before December 1, 1980. (2) <T3>Payments for services. </T3>A payment the claimant makes for servicesmay be deducted if the services are received while the claimant is workingand the payment is made in a month the claimant is working. The Board considersthe claimant to be working even though he or she must leave work temporarilyto receive the services. (3) <T3>Payments for items. </T3>A payment the claimant makes toward the costof a deductible item (regardless of when it is acquired) may be deductedif payment is made in a month the claimant is working. See paragraph (e)(4)of this section when purchases are made in anticipation of work. (e) <T3>How expenses are allocated_</T3>(1) <T3>Recurring expenses. </T3>The claimant may pay for services on a regularperiodic basis, or the claimant may purchase an item on credit and payfor it in regular periodic installments or the claimant may rent an item.If so, each payment the claimant makes for the services and each paymentthe claimant makes toward the purchase or rental (including interest) isdeductible in the month it is made.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example: </T4>B starts work in October 1981 at which time she purchasesa medical device at a cost of $4,800 plus interest charges of $720. Hermonthly payments begin in October. She earns and receives $400 a month.The term of the installment contract is 48 months. No downpayment is made.The monthly allowable deduction for the item would be $115 ($5,520 dividedby 48) for each month of work during the 48 months.</ITAG>(2) <T3>Non-recurring expenses. </T3>Part or all of the claimant's expensesmay not be recurring. For example, the claimant may make a one-time paymentin full for an item or service or make a downpayment. If the claimant isworking when he or she makes the payment, the Board will either deductthe entire amount in the month the claimant pays it or allocate the amountover a 12 consecutive month period beginning with the month of payment,whichever the claimant selects.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example: </T4>A begins working in October 1981 and earns $525 a month.In the same month, he purchases and pays for a deductible item at a costof $250. In this situation the Board could allow a $250 deduction for October1981, reducing A's earnings below the substantial gainful activity levelfor that month. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If A's earnings had been $15 above the substantial gainful activityearnings amount, A probably would select the option of projecting the $250payment over the 12-month period, October 1981-September 1982, giving Aan allowable deduction of $20.83 a month for each month of work duringthat period. This deduction would reduce A's earnings below the substantialgainful activity level for 12 months.</ITAG>(3) <T3>Allocating downpayments. </T3>If the claimant makes a downpayment,the Board will, if the claimant chooses, make a separate calculation forthe downpayment in order to provide for uniform monthly deductions. Inthese situations the Board will determine the total payment that the claimantwill make over a 12 consecutive month period beginning with the month ofthe downpayment and allocate that amount over the 12 months. Beginningwith the 13th month, the regular monthly payment will be deductible. Thisallocation process will be for a shorter period if the claimant's regularmonthly payments will extend over a period of less than 12 months.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 1: </T4>C starts working in October 1981, at which time hepurchases special equipment at a cost of $4,800, paying $1,200 down.

In this situation the Board would allowa deduction of $205.42 a month for each month of work during the periodOctober 1981 through September 1982. After September 1982, the deductionamount would be the regular monthly payment of $115 for each month of workduring the remaining installment period. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s25,6,10</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> Explanation: <ITAG tagnum="2">Downpayment in October 1981 <D>$1,200</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Monthly payments:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3"> November 1981 through September 1982 </ITAG><D>1,265</D><R>n,s,n</R><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>$2,465 </D><D>12=205.42</D></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 2. </T4>D, while working, buys a deductible item in July 1981,paying $1,450 down.

When anitem is paid for in full during the 11 months preceding the month the claimantstarted working, the payment will be allocated over the 12 consecutivemonth period beginning with the month of the payment. However, the onlyportion of the payment which may be deductible is the portion allocatedto the month work begins and the following months. For example, if an itemis purchased 3 months before the month work began and is paid for witha one-time payment of $600, the deductible amount would be $450 ($600 dividedby 12, multiplied by 9). Installment payments (including a downpayment)that the claimant made for a particular item during the 11 months precedingthe month he or she started working will be totalled and considered tohave been made in the month of the claimant's first payment for that itemwithin this 11 month period. The sum of these payments will be allocatedover the 12 consecutive month period beginning with the month of the claimant'sfirst payment (but never earlier than 11 months before the month work began).However, the only portion of the total which may be deductible is the portionallocated to the month work begins and the following months. For example,if an item is purchased three months before the month work began and ispaid for in three monthly installments of $200 each, the total paymentof $600 will be considered to have been made in the month of the firstpayment, that is, three months before the month work began. The deductibleamount would be $450 ($600 divided by 12, multiplied by 9). The amount,as determined by these formulas, will then be considered to have been paidin the first month of work. The Board will deduct either this entire amountin the first month of work or allocate it over a 12 consecutive month period,beginning with the first month of work, whichever the claimant selects.In the above examples, the claimant would have the choice of having theentire $450 deducted in the first month of work or having $37.50 a month($450 divided by 12) deducted for each month that he or she works overa 12 consecutive month period, beginning with the first month of work.To be deductible, the payments must be for durable items such as medicaldevices, prostheses, work-related equipment, residential modifications,non-medical appliances and vehicle modifications. Payments for servicesand expendable items such as drugs, oxygen, diagnostic procedures, medicalsupplies and vehicle operating costs are not deductible for the purposeof this paragraph. (f) <T3>Limits on deductions. </T3>(1) The Board will deduct the actual amountsthe claimant pays towards his or her impairment-related work expenses unlessthe amounts are unreasonable. With respect to durable medical equipment,prosthetic devices, medical services, and similar medically-related itemsand services, the Board will apply the prevailing charges under Medicare(Part B of title XVIII, Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled) tothe extent that this information is readily available. Where the Medicareguides are used, the Board will consider the amount that the claimant paysto be reasonable if it is no more than the prevailing charge for the sameitem or service under the Medicare guidelines. If the amount the claimantactually pays is more than the prevailing charge for the same item underthe Medicare guidelines, the Board will deduct from the claimant's earningsthe amount the claimant paid to the extent he or she establishes that theamount is consistent with the standard or normal charge for the same orsimilar item or service in his or her community. For items and servicesthat are not listed in the Medicare guidelines, and for items and servicesthat are listed in the Medicare guidelines but for which such guides cannotbe used because the information is not readily available, the Board willconsider the amount the claimant pays to be reasonable if it does not exceedthe standard or normal charge for the same or similar item or service inthe claimant's community. (2) Impairment-related work expenses are not deducted in computing theclaimant's earnings for purposes of determining whether the claimant'swork was ``services'' as described in andSection;220.170. (3) The decision as to whether the claimant performed substantial gainfulactivity in a case involving impairment-related work expenses for itemsor services necessary for the claimant to work generally will be basedupon the claimant's ``earnings'' and not on the value of ``services'' theclaimant rendered. (See andSection;220.143(b)(6) (i) and (ii), and andSection;220.144(a)).This is not necessarily so, however, if the claimant is in a position tocontrol or manipulate his or her earnings. (4) No deduction will be allowed to the extent that any other source haspaid or will pay for an item or service. No deduction will be allowed tothe extent that the claimant has been, could be, or will be reimbursedfor payments he or she made. (See paragraph (b)(3) of this section.) (5) The provisions described in the foregoing paragraphs of this sectionare effective with respect to expenses incurred on or after December 1,1980, although expenses incurred after November 1980, as a result of contractualor other arrangements entered into before December 1980, are deductible.For months before December 1980, the Board will deduct impairment-relatedwork expenses from the claimant's earnings only to the extent they exceededthe normal work-related expenses the claimant would have had if the claimantdid not have his or her impairment(s). The Board will not deduct expenses,however, for those things which the claimant needed even when he or shewas not working. (g) <T3>Verification. </T3>The Board will verify the claimant's need for itemsor services for which deductions are claimed, and the amount of the chargesfor those items or services. The claimant will also be asked to provideproof that he or she paid for the items or services.   <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart M_Disability Annuity Earnings Restrictions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.160</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">How work for a railroad employer affects a disability annuity. </ITAG>A disability annuity is not payable and the annuity must be returned forany month in which the disabled annuitant works for an employer as definedin Part 202 of this chapter. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.161</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">How work affects an employee disability annuity. </ITAG>In addition to the condition in andSection; 220.160, the employee's disabilityannuity is not payable and the employee must return the annuity paymentfor any month in which the employee earns more than $400 (after deductionof impairment related work expenses) in employment or self-employment ofany kind.

The last $200 or more of earnings over $4,800 is treated asif it were $400. If the annuity rate changes during the year, any annuitiesdue at the end of the year are paid first for months in which the annuityrate is higher.

The trial work period begins and endsas described in paragraph (e) of this section. During this period, theannuitant may perform ``services'' (see paragraph (b) of this section)in as many as nine months, but these months do not have to be consecutive.The Board will not consider those services as showing that the annuitant'sdisability has ended until the annuitant has performed services in at leastnine months. However, after the trial work period has ended, the Boardwill consider the work the annuitant did during the trial work period indetermining whether the annuitant's disability has ended at any time afterthe trial work period.  (b) <T3>What the Board means by services.</T3> When used in this section, ``services''means any activity, even though it is not substantial gainful activity,which is done by the annuitant in employment or self-employment for payor profit, or is the kind normally done for pay or profit. If the annuitantis employed, the Board will consider his or her work to be ``services''if in any calendar year after 1978 the annuitant earns more than $75 amonth ($50 a month is the figure for earnings in any calendar year before1979). If the annuitant is self-employed, the Board will consider his orher activities ``services'' if in any calendar year after 1978 the annuitant'snet earnings are more than $75 a month, ($50 a month is the figure forearnings in any calendar year before 1979), or the annuitant works morethan 15 hours a month in the business.

(c) <T3>Limitations on the number of trial work periods.</T3> The annuitantmay have only one trial period during each period in which he or she isdisabled for any regular employment as defined in andSection;220.26.  (d) <T3>Who is and is not entitled to a trial work period.</T3> (1) Generally,the annuitant is entitled to a trial work period if he or she is entitledto an annuity based on disability.  (2) An annuitant is not entitled to a trial work period if he or she isin a second period of disability for which he or she did not have to completea waiting period before qualifying for a disability annuity.  (e) <T3>Payment of the disability annuity during the trial work period.</T3>(1) The disability annuity of an employee, child, or widow(er) who is disabledfor any regular employment will not be paid for any month in the trialwork period in which the annuitant works for an employer covered by theRailroad Retirement Act (see andSection;220.160).

When the annuitantis entitled to a disability annuity as a disabled employee, disabled widow(er)or as a person disabled since childhood, there are a number of factorsto be considered in deciding whether his or her disability continues. TheBoard must first consider whether the annuitant has worked and, by doingso, demonstrated the ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.If so, the disability will end. If the annuitant has not demonstrated theability to engage in substantial gainful activity, then the Board mustdetermine if there has been any medical improvement in the annuitant'simpairment(s) and, if so, whether this medical improvement is related tothe annuitant's ability to work. If an impairment(s) has not medicallyimproved, the Board must consider whether one or more of the exceptionsto medical improvement applies. If medical improvement related to abilityto work has not occurred and no exception applies, the disability willcontinue. Even where medical improvement related to ability to work hasoccurred or an exception applies (see andSection; 220.179 for exceptions),in most cases the Board must also show that the annuitant is currentlyable to engage in substantial gainful activity before it can find thatthe annuitant is no longer disabled. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.177</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Terms and definitions. </ITAG>There are several terms and definitions which are important to know inorder to understand how the Board reviews whether a disability for anyregular employment continues: (a) <T3>Medical improvement. </T3>Medical improvement is any decrease in themedical severity of an impairment(s) which was present at the time of themost recent favorable medical decision that the annuitant was disabledor continued to be disabled. A determination that there has been a decreasein medical severity must be based on a comparison of prior and currentmedical evidence showing changes (improvement) in the symptoms, signs orlaboratory findings associated with the impairment(s).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 1: </T4>The claimant was awarded a disability annuity due toa herniated disc. At the time of the Board's prior decision granting theclaimant an annuity he had had a laminectomy. Postoperatively, a myelogramstill shows evidence of a persistent deficit in his lumbar spine. He hadpain in his back, and pain and a burning sensation in his right foot andleg. There were no muscle weakness or neurological changes and a modestdecrease in motion in his back and leg. When the Board reviewed the annuitant'sclaim to determine whether his disability should be continued, his treatingphysician reported that he had seen the annuitant regularly every 2 to3 months for the past 2 years. No further myelograms had been done, complaintsof pain in the back and right leg continued especially on sitting or standingfor more than a short period of time. The annuitant's doctor further reporteda moderately decreased range of motion in the annuitant's back and rightleg, but again no muscle atrophy or neurological changes were reported.Medical improvement has <T3>not </T3>occurred because there has been no decrease in the severityof the annuitant's back impairment as shown by changes in symptoms, signsor laboratory findings. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 2: </T4>The claimant was awarded a disability annuity due toa rheumatoid arthritis. At the time, laboratory findings were positivefor this impairment. The claimant's doctor reported persistent swellingand tenderness of the claimant's fingers and wrists and that he complainedof joint pain. Current medical evidence shows that while laboratory testsare still positive for rheumatoid arthritis, the annuitant's impairmenthas responded favorably to therapy so that for the last year his fingersand wrists have not been significantly swollen or painful. Medical improvementhas occurred because there has been a decrease in the severity of the annuitant'simpairment as documented by the current symptoms and signs reported byhis physician. Although the annuitant's impairment is subject to temporaryremission and exacerbations, the improvement that has occurred has beensustained long enough to permit a finding of medical improvement. The Boardwould then determine if this medical improvement is related to the annuitant'sability to work.</ITAG>(b) <T3>Medical improvement not related to ability to do work. </T3>Medicalimprovement is not related to the annuitant's ability to work if therehas been a decrease in the severity of the impairment(s) (as defined inparagraph (a) of this section) present at the time of the most recent favorablemedical decision, but <T3>no </T3>increase in that annuitant's functional capacity to do basicwork activities as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. If there hasbeen any medical improvement in an annuitant's impairment(s), but it isnot related to the annuitant's ability to do work and none of the exceptionsapplies, the annuity will be continued.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example: </T4>An annuitant was 65 inches tall and weighed 246 poundsat the time his disability was established. He had venous insufficiencyand persistent edema in his legs. At the time, the annuitant's abilityto do basic work activities was affected because he was able to sit for6 hours, but was able to stand or walk only occasionally. At the time ofthe Board's continuing disability review, the annuitant had undergone avein stripping operation. He now weighed 220 pounds and had intermittentedema. He is still able to sit for 6 hours at a time and to stand or walkonly occassionally although he reports less discomfort on walking. Medicalimprovement has occurred because there has been a decrease in the severityof the existing impairment as shown by his weight loss and the improvementin his edema. This medical improvement is not related to his ability towork, however, because his functional capacity to do basic work activities(i.e., the ability to sit, stand and walk) has not increased.</ITAG>(c) <T3>Medical improvement that is related to ability to do work. </T3>Medicalimprovement is related to an annuitant's ability to work if there has beena decrease in the severity (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section)of the impairment(s) present at the time of the most recent favorable medicaldecision <T3>and </T3>an increase in the annuitant's functional capacity to do basicwork activities as discussed in paragraph (d) of this section. A determinationthat medical improvement related to an annuitant's ability to do work hasoccurred does not, necessarily, mean that such annuitant's disability willbe found to have ended unless it is also shown that the annuitant is currentlyable to engage in substantial gainful activity as discussed in paragraph(e) of this section.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 1: </T4>The annuitant has a back impairment and has had a laminectomyto relieve the nerve root impingement and weakness in his left leg. Atthe time of the Board's prior decision, basic work activities were affectedbecause he was able to stand less than 6 hours, and sit no more than \1/2\hour at a time. The annuitant had a successful fusion operation on hisback about 1 year before the Board's review of his entitlement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At the time of the Board's review, the weakness in his leg decreased.The annuitant's functional capacity to perform basic work activities nowis unimpaired because he now has no limitation on his ability to sit, walk,or stand. Medical improvement has occurred because there has been a decreasein the severity of his impairment as demonstrated by the decreased weaknessin his leg. This medical improvement is related to his ability to workbecause there has been also an increase in his functional capacity to performbasic work activities (or residual functional capacity) as shown by theabsence of limitation on his ability to sit, walk, or stand. Whether ornot his disability is found to have ended, however, will depend on theBoard's determination as to whether he can currently engage in substantialgainful actitity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 2: </T4>The annuitant was injured in an automobile accidentreceiving a compound fracture to his right femur and a fractured pelvis.When he applied for disability annuity 10 months after the accident hisdoctor reported that neither fracture had yet achieved solid union basedon his clinical examination. X-rays supported this finding. The annuitant'sdoctor estimated that solid union and a subsequent return to full weightbearing would not occur for at least 3 months. At the time of the Board'sreviw 6 months later, solid union had occurred and the annuitant had beenreturned to full weight-bearing for over a month. His doctor reported thisand the fact that his prior fracture no longer placed any limitation onhis ability to walk, stand, and lift, and, that in fact, he could returnto full-time work if he so desired.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Medical improvement has occurred because there has been a decreasein the severity of the annuitant's impairments as shown by x-ray and clinicalevidence of solid union and his return to full weight-bearing. This medicalimprovement is related to his ability to work because he no longer meetsthe same listed impairment in Appendix 1 of this part (see andSection; 220.178(c)(1)).Whether or not the annuitant's disability is found to have ended will dependon the Board's determination as to whether he can currently engage in substantialgainful activity.</ITAG>(d) <T3>Functional capacity to do basic work activities. </T3>(1) Under thelaw, disability is defined, in part, as the inability to do any regularemployment by reason of a physical or mental impairment(s). ``Regular employment''is defined in this part as ``substantial gainful activity.'' In determiningwhether the annuitant is disabled under the law, the Board will measure,therefore, how and to what extent the annuitant's impairment(s) has affectedhis or her ability to do work. The Board does this by looking at how theannuitant's functional capacity for doing basic work activities has beenaffected. Basic work activities means the abilities and aptitudes necessaryto do most jobs. Included are exertional abilities such as walking, standing,pushing, pulling, reaching and carrying, and nonexertional abilities andaptitudes such as seeing, hearing, speaking, remembering, using judgment,dealing with changes in a work setting and dealing with both supervisorsand fellow workers. The annuitant who has no impairment(s) would be ableto do all basic work activities at normal levels; he or she would havean unlimited functional capacity to do basic work activities. Dependingon its nature and severity, an impairment(s) will result in some limitationto the functional capacity to do one or more of these basic work activities.Diabetes, for example, can result in circulatory problems which could limitthe length of time the annuitant could stand or walk and can result indamage to his or her eyes as well, so that the annuitant also has limitedvision. What the annuitant can still do, despite his or her impairment(s),is called his or her residual functional capacity. How the residual functionalcapacity is assessed is discussed in more detail in andSection; 220.120.Unless an impairment is so severe that it is deemed to prevent the annuitantfrom doing substantial gainful activity (i.e., the impairment(s)) meetsor equals the severity of a listed impairment in Appendix 1 of this part),it is this residual functional capacity that is used to determine whetherthe annuitant can still do his or her past work or, in conjunction withhis or her age, education and work experience, do any other work.(2) A decrease in the severity of an impairment as measured by changes(improvement) in symptoms, signs or laboratory findings can, if great enough,result in an increase in the functional capacity to do work activities.Vascular surgery (e.g., femaropopliteal bypass) may sometimes reduce theseverity of the circulatory complications of diabetes so that better circulationresults and the annuitant can stand or walk for longer periods. When newevidence showing a change in medical findings establishes that both medicalimprovement has occurred and the annuitant's functional capacity to performbasic work activities, or residual functional capacity, has increased,the Board will find that medical improvement which is related to the annuitant'sability to do work has occurred. A residual functional capacity assessmentis also used to determine whether an annuitant can engage in substantialgainful activity and, thus, whether he or she continues to be disabled(see paragraph (e) of this section).(3) Many impairment-related factors must be considered in assessing anannuitant's functional capacity for basic work activities. Age is one keyfactor. Medical literature shows that there is a gradual decrease in organfunction with age; that major losses and deficits become irreversible overtime and that maximum exercise performance diminishes with age. Other changesrelated to sustained periods of inactivity and the aging process includemuscle atrophy, degenerative joint changes, decrease in range of motion,and changes in the cardiac and respiratory systems which limit the exertionalrange.(4) Studies has also shown that the longer the annuitant is away from theworkplace and is inactive, the more difficult it becomes to return to ongoinggainful employment. In addition, a gradual change occurs in most jobs sothat after about 15 years, it is no longer realistic to expect that skillsand abilities acquired in these jobs will continue to apply to the currentworkplace. Thus, if the annuitant is age 50 or over and has been receivinga disability annuity for a considerable period of time, the Board willconsider this factor along with his or her age in assessing the residualfunctional capacity. This will ensure that the disadvantages resultingfrom inactivity and the aging process during a longer period of disabilitywill be considered. In some instances where available evidence does notresolve what the annuitant can or cannot do on a sustained basis, the Boardmay provide special work evaluations or other appropriate testing.(e) <T3>Ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. </T3>In most instances,the Board must show that the annuitant is able to engage in substantialgainful activity before stopping his or her annuity. When doing this, theBoard will consider all of the annuitant's current impairments not justthat impairment(s) present at the time of the most recent favorable determination.If the Board cannot determine that the annuitant is still disabled basedon medical considerations alone (as discussed in andSection;andSection; 220.110through 220.115), it will use the new symptoms, signs and laboratory findingsto make an objective assessment of functional capacity to do basic workactivities (or residual functional capacity) and will consider vocationalfactors. See andSection;andSection; 220.120 through 220.134. (f) <T3>Evidence and basis for the Board's decision. </T3>The Board's decisionsunder this section will be made on a neutral basis without any initialinference as to the presence or absence of disability being drawn fromthe fact that the annuitant had previously been determined to be disabled.The Board will consider all of the evidence the annuitant submits. An annuitantmust give the Board reports from his or her physician, psychologist, orothers who have treated or evaluated him or her, as well as any other evidencethat will help the Board determine if he or she is still disabled (seeandSection; 220.45). The annuitant must have a good reason for not givingthe Board this information or the Board may find that his or her disabilityhas ended (see andSection; 220.178(b)(2)). If the Board asks the annuitant,he or she must contact his or her medical sources to help the Board getthe medical reports. The Board will make every reasonable effort to helpthe annuitant in getting medical reports when he or she gives the Boardpermission to request them from his or her physician, psychologist, orother medical sources. Every reasonable effort means that the Board willmake an initial request and, after 20 days, one followup request to theannuitant medical source to obtain the medical evidence necessary to makea determination before the Board evaluates medical evidence obtained fromanother source on a consultative basis. The medical source will have 10days from the followup to reply (unless experience indicates that a longerperiod is advisable in a particular case). In some instances the Boardmay order a consultative examination while awaiting receipt of medicalsource evidence. Before deciding that an annuitant's disability had ended,the Board will develop a complete medical history covering at least thepreceding 12 months (See andSection; 220.45(b)). A consultative examinationmay be purchased when the Board needs additional evidence to determinewhether or not an annuitant's disability continues. As a result, the Boardmay ask the annuitant, upon the Board request and reasonable notice, toundergo consultative examinations and tests to help the Board determineif the annuitant is still disabled (see andSection; 220.50). The Board willdecide whether or not to purchase a consultative examination in accordancewith the standards in andSection;andSection; 220.53 through 220.54. (g) <T3>Point of comparison. </T3>For purposes of determining whether medicalimprovement has occurred, the Board will compare the current medical severityof that impairment(s), which was present at the time of the most recentfavorable medical decision that the annuitant was disabled or continuedto be disabled, to the medical severity of that impairment(s) at that time.If medical improvement has occurred, the Board will compare the annuitant'scurrent functional capacity to do basic work activities (i.e., his or herresidual functional capacity) based on this previously existing impairment(s)with the annuitant's prior residual functional capacity in order to determinewhether the medical improvement is related to his or her ability to dowork. The most recent favorable medical decision is the latest decisioninvolving a consideration of the medical evidence and the issue of whetherthe annuitant was disabled or continued to be disabled which became final.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.178</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Determining medical improvement and its relationship to the annuitant'sability to do work. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of andSection; 220.177 discusswhat is meant by medical improvement, medical improvement not related tothe ability to work and medical improvement that is related to the abilityto work. How the Board will arrive at the decision that medical improvementhas occurred and its relationship to the ability to do work, is discussedin paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.(b) <T3>Determining if medical improvement is related to ability to work.</T3>If there is a decrease in medical severity as shown by the symptoms, signsand laboratory findings, the Board then must determine if it is relatedto the annuitant's ability to do work. In andSection; 220.177(d) the relationshipbetween medical severity and limitation on functional capacity to do basicwork activities (or residual functional capacity) and how changes in medicalseverity can affect the annuitant's residual functional capacity is explained.In determining whether medical improvement that has occurred is relatedto the annuitant's ability to do work, the Board will assess the annuitant'sresidual functional capacity (in accordance with andSection; 220.177(d))based on the current severity of the impairment(s) which was present atthat annuitant's last favorable medical decision. The annuitant's new residualfunctional capacity will then be compared to the annuitant's residual functionalcapacity at the time of the Board's most recent favorable medical decision.Unless an increase in the current residual functional capacity is basedon changes in the signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings, any medicalimprovement that has occurred will not be considered to be related to theannuitant's ability to do work.(c) <T3>Additional factors and considerations. </T3>The Board will also applythe following in its determinations of medical improvement and its relationshipto the annuitant's ability to do work:(1) <T3>Previous impairment met or equaled listings.</T3> If the Board's mostrecent favorable decision was based on the fact that the annuitant's impairment(s)at the time met or equaled the severity contemplated by the Listing ofImpairments in Appendix I of this Part, an assessment of his or her residualfunctional capacity would not have been made. If medical improvement hasoccurred and the severity of the prior impairment(s) no longer meets orequals the same listing, the Board will find that the medical improvementwas related to the annuitant's ability to work. Appendix I of this Partdescribes impairments which, if severe enough, affect the annuitant's abilityto work. If the Listing level of severity is met or equaled, the annuitantis deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be unable toengage in substantial gainful activity. If there has been medical improvementto the degree that the requirement of the listing is no longer met or equaled,then the medical improvement is related to the annuitant's ability to work.The Board must, of course, also establish that the annuitant can currentlyengage in gainful activity before finding that his or her disability hasended.(2) <T3>Prior residual functional capacity assessment made.</T3> The residualfunctional capacity assessment used in making the most recent favorablemedical decision will be compared to the residual functional capacity assessmentbased on current evidence in order to determine if an annuitant's functionalcapacity for basic work activities has increased. There will be no attemptmade to reassess the prior residual functional capacity.(3) <T3>Prior residual functional capacity assessment should have been made,but was not. </T3>If the most recent favorable medical decision shouldhave contained an assessment of the annuitant's residual functional capacity(i.e., his or her impairment(s) did not meet or equal the level of severitycontemplated by the Listing of Impairments in Appendix I of this Part)but does not, either because this assessment is missing from the annuitant'sfile or because it was not done, the Board will reconstruct the residualfunctional capacity. This reconstructed residual functional capacity willaccurately and objectively assess the annuitant's functional capacity todo basic work activities. The Board will assign the maximum functionalcapacity consistent with an allowance.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example:</T4> The annuitant was previously found to be disabled onthe basis that while his impairment did not meet or equal a listing, itdid prevent him from doing his past or any other work. The prior adjudicatordid not, however, include a residual functional capacity assessment inthe rationale of that decision and a review of the prior evidence doesnot show that such an assessment was ever made. If a decrease in medicalseverity, i.e., medical improvement, has occurred, the residual functionalcapacity based on the current level of severity of the annuitant's impairmentwill have to be compared with his residual functional capacity based onits prior severity in order to determine if the medical improvement isrelated to his ability to do work. In order to make this comparison, theBoard will review the prior evidence and make an objective assessment ofthe annuitant's residual functional capacity at the time of its most recentfavorable medical determination, based on the symptoms, signs and laboratoryfindings as they then existed.</ITAG>(4) <T3>Impairment subject to temporary remission.</T3> In some cases the evidenceshows that the annuitant's impairment(s) are subject to temporary remission.In assessing whether medical improvement has occurred in annuitants withthis type of impairment(s), the Board will be careful to consider the longitudinalhistory of the impairment(s), including the occurrence of prior remission,and prospects for future worsenings. Improvement in such impairment(s)that is only temporary, i.e., less than 1 year, will not warrant a findingof medical improvement.(5) <T3>Prior file cannot be located.</T3> If the prior file cannot be located,the Board will first determine whether the annuitant is able to now engagein substantial gainful activity based on all of his or her current impairments.(In this way, the Board will be able to determine that his or her disabilitycontinues at the earliest point without addressing the often lengthy processof reconstructing prior evidence.) If the annuitant cannot engage in substantialgainful activity currently, his or her disability will continue unlessone of the second group of exceptions applies (see andSection; 220.179(b)).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.179</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exceptions to medical improvement.</ITAG>(a) <T3>First group of exceptions to medical improvement.</T3> The law providesfor certain limited situations when the annuitant's disability can be foundto have ended even though medical improvement has not occurred, if he orshe can engage in substantial gainful activity. These exceptions to medicalimprovement are intended to provide a way of finding that the annuitantis no longer disabled in those limited situations where, even though therehas been no decrease in severity of the impairment(s), evidence shows thatthe annuitant should no longer be considered disabled or never should havebeen considered disabled. If one of these exceptions applies, the Boardmust also show that, taking all of the annuitant's current impairment(s)into account, not just those that existed at the time of the Board's mostrecent favorable medical decision, the annuitant is now able to engagein substantial gainful activity before his or her disability can be foundto have ended. As part of the review process, the annuitant will be askedabout any medical or vocational therapy that he or she has received oris receiving. Those answers and the evidence gathered as a result as wellas all other evidence, will serve as the basis for the finding that anexception applies.(1) <T3>Substantial evidence shows that the annuitant is the beneficiary ofadvances in medical or vocational therapy or technology (related to hisor her ability to work).</T3> Advances in medical or vocational therapyor technology are improvements in treatment or rehabilitative methods whichhave increased the annuitant's ability to do basic work activities. TheBoard will apply this exception when substantial evidence shows that theannuitant has been the beneficiary of services which reflect these advancesand they have favorably affected the severity of his or her impairment(s)or ability to do basic work activities. This decision will be based onnew medical evidence and a new residual functional capacity assessment.In many instances, an advanced medical therapy or technology will resultin a decrease in severity as shown by symptoms, signs and laboratory findingswhich will meet the definition of medical improvement. This exception will,therefore, see very limited application.(2) <T3>Substantial evidence shows that the annuitant has undergone vocationaltherapy (related to his or her ability to work).</T3> Vocational therapy(related to the annuitant's ability to work) may include, but is not limitedto, additional education, training, or work experience that improves hisor her ability to meet the vocational requirements of more jobs. This decisionwill be based on substantial evidence which includes new medical evidenceand a new residual functional capacity assessment. If, at the time of theBoard's review the annuitant has not completed vocational therapy whichcould affect the continuance of his or her disability, the Board will reviewsuch annuitant's claim upon completion of the therapy.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 1:</T4> The annuitant was found to be disabled because thelimitations imposed on him by his impairment(s) allowed him to only dowork that was at a sedentary level of exertion. The annuitant's prior workexperience was work that required a medium level of exertion with no acquiredskills that could be transferred to sedentary work. His age, education,and past work experience at the time did not qualify him for work thatwas below this medium level of exertion. The annuitant enrolled in andcompleted a specialized training course which qualifies him for a job indata processing as a computer programmer in the period since he was awardeda disability annuity. On review of his claim, current evidence shows thatthere is no medical improvement and that he can still do only sedentarywork. As the work of a computer programmer is sedentary in nature, he isnow able to engage in substantial gainful activity when his new skillsare considered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 2:</T4> The annuitant was previously entitled to a disabilityannuity because the medical evidence and assessment of his residual functionalcapacity showed he could only do light work. His prior work was consideredto be of a heavy exertional level with no acquired skills that could betransferred to light work. His age, education, and past work experiencedid not qualify him for work that was below the heavy level of exertion.The current evidence and residual functional capacity show there has beenno medical improvement and that he can still do only light work. Sincehe was originally entitled to a disability annuity, his vocational rehabilitationagency enrolled him in and he successfully completed a trade school courseso that he is now qualified to do small appliance repair. This work islight in nature, so when his new skills are considered, he is now ableto engage in substantial gainful activity even though there has been nochange in his residual functional capacity.</ITAG>(3) <T3>Substantial evidence shows that based on new or improved diagnosticor evaluative techniques the annuitant's impairment(s) is not as disablingas it was considered to be at the time of the most recent favorable decision.</T3>Changing methodologies and advances in medical and other diagnostic orevaluative techniques have given, and will continue to give, rise to improvedmethods for measuring and documenting the effect of various impairmentson the ability to do work. Where, by such new or improved methods, substantialevidence shows that the annuitant's impairment(s) is not as severe as wasdetermined at the time of the Board's most recent favorable medical decision,such evidence may serve as a basis for finding that the annuitant can engagein substantial gainful activity and is no longer disabled. In order tobe used under this exception, however, the new or improved techniques musthave become generally available after the date of the Board's most recentfavorable medical decision.(i) <T3>How the Board will determine which methods are new or improved techniquesand when they become generally available.</T3> New or improved diagnostictechniques or evaluations will come to the Board's attention by severalmethods. In reviewing cases, the Board often becomes aware of new techniqueswhen their results are presented as evidence. Such techniques and evaluationsare also discussed and acknowledged in medical literature by medical professionalgroups and other governmental entities. Through these sources, the Boarddevelops listings of new techniques and when they become generally available.(ii) <T3>How the annuitant will know which methods are new or improved techniquesand when they become generally available.</T3> The Board will let annuitantsknow which methods it considers to be new or improved techniques and whenthey become available. Some of the future changes in the Listing of Impairmentsin Appendix 1 of this part will be based on new or improved diagnosticor evaluative techniques. Such listings changes will clearly state thisfact as they are published as Notices of Proposed Rulemaking and the newor improved techniques will be considered generally available as of thedate of the final publication of that particular listing in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example:</T4> The electrocardiographic exercise test has replaced theMaster's 2-step test as a measurement of heart function since the timeof the annuitant's last favorable medical decision. Current evidence showsthat the annuitant's impairment, which was previously evaluated based onthe Master's 2-step test, is not now as disabling as was previously thought.If, taking all his current impairments into account, the annuitant is nowable to engage in substantial gainful activity, this exception would beused to find that he is no longer disabled even if medical improvementhas not occurred.</ITAG>(4) <T3>Substantial evidence demonstrates that any prior disability decisionwas in error.</T3> The Board will apply the exception to medical improvementbased on error if substantial evidence (which may be evidence on the recordat the time any prior determination of the entitlement to an annuity basedon disability was made, or newly obtained evidence which relates to thatdetermination) demonstrates that a prior determination was in error. Aprior determination will be found in error only if:(i) Substantial evidence shows on its face that the decision in questionshould not have been made (e.g., the evidence in file such as pulmonaryfunction study values was misread or an adjudicative standard such as alisting in Appendix 1 of this part or a medical/vocational rule in Appendix2 of this part was misapplied).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 1:</T4> The annuitant was granted a disability annuity whenit was determined that his epilepsy met Listing 11.02. This listing callsfor a finding of major motor seizures more frequently than once a monthas documented by EEG evidence and by a detailed description of a typicalseizure pattern. A history of either diurnal episodes or nocturnal episodeswith residuals interfering with daily activities is also required. On review,it is found that a history of the frequency of his seizures showed thatthey occurred only once or twice a year. The prior decision would be foundto be in error, and whether the annuitant was still considered to be disabledwould be based on whether he could currently engage in substantial gainfulactivity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 2: </T4>The annuitant's prior award of a disability annuitywas based on vocational rule 201.14 in Appendix 2 of this part. This ruleapplies to a person age 50-54 who has at least a high school education,whose previous work was entirely at semiskilled level, and who can do onlysedentary work. On review it is found that at the time of the prior determinationthe annuitant was actually only age 46 and vocational rule 201.21 shouldhave been used. This rule would have called for a denial of his claim andthe prior decision is found to have been in error. Continuation of hisdisability would depend on a finding of his current inability to engagein substantial gainful activity.</ITAG>(ii) At the time of the prior evaluation, required and material evidenceof the severity of the annuitant's impairment(s) was missing. That evidencebecomes available upon review, and substantial evidence demonstrates thathad such evidence been present at the time of the prior determination,disability would not have been found.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example: </T4>The annuitant was found disabled on the basis of chronicobstructive pulmonary disease. The severity of his impairment was documentedprimarily by pulmonary function testing results. The evidence showed thathe could do only light work. Spirometric tracings of this testing, althoughrequired, were not obtained, however. On review, the original report isresubmitted by the consultative examining physician along with the correspondingspirometric tracings. A review of the tracings shows that the test wasinvalid. Current pulmonary function testing supported by spirometric tracingsreveals that the annuitant's impairment does not limit his ability to performbasic work activities in any way. Error is found based on the fact thatrequired material evidence, which was originally missing, now becomes availableand shows that if it had been available at the time of the prior determination,disability would not have been found.</ITAG>(iii) Substantial evidence which is new evidence relating to the priordetermination (of allowance or continuance) refutes the conclusions thatwere based upon the prior evidence (e.g., a tumor thought to be malignantwas later shown to have actually been benign). Substantial evidence mustshow that had the new evidence (which relates to the prior determination)been considered at the time of the prior decision, the disability wouldnot have been allowed or continued. A substitution of current judgmentfor that used in the prior favorable decision will not be the basis forapplying this exception.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example: </T4>The annuitant was previously found entitled to a disabilityannuity on the basis of diabetes mellitus which the prior adjudicator believedwas equivalent to the level of severity contemplated in the Listing ofImpairments. The prior record shows that the annuitant has ``brittle''diabetes for which he was taking insulin. The annuitant's urine was 3+for sugar, and he alleged occasional hypoglycemic attacks caused by exertion.His doctor felt the diabetes was never really controlled because he wasnot following his diet or taking his medication regularly. On review, symptoms,signs and laboratory findings are unchanged. The current adjudicator feels,however, that the annuitant's impairment clearly does not equal the severitycontemplated by the listings. Error <T3>cannot</T3> be found because it would represent a substitution of currentjudgment for that of the prior adjudicator that the annuitant's impairmentequaled a listing. The exception for error will not be applied retroactivelyunder the conditions set out above unless the conditions for reopeningthe prior decision are met.</ITAG>(5) <T3>The annuitant is currently engaging in substantial gainful activity.</T3>If the annuitant is currently engaging in substantial gainful activity,before the Board determines whether he or she is no longer disabled becauseof his or her work activity, the Board will consider whether he or sheis entitled to a trial work period as set out in andSection; 220.170. TheBoard will find that the annuitant's disability has ended in the monthin which he or she demonstrated the ability to engage in substantial gainfulactivity (following completion of a trial work period, where it applies).This exception does not apply in determining whether the annuitant continuesto have a disabling impairment(s) for purposes of deciding his or her eligibilityfor a reentitlement period.(b) <T3>Second group of exceptions to medical improvement. </T3>In additionto the first group of exceptions to medical improvement, the followingexceptions may result in a determination that the annuitant is no longerdisabled. In these situations the decision will be made without a determinationthat the annuitant has medically improved or can engage in substantialgainful activity.(1) <T3>A prior determination was fraudulently obtained. </T3>If the Boardfinds that any prior favorable determination was obtained by fraud, itmay find that the annuitant is not disabled.

The month in which the annuitant's disability ends will bethe first month in which he or she failed to do what was requested. (3) <T3>Inability of the Board to locate the annuitant. </T3>If there is aquestion about whether the annuitant continues to be disabled and the Boardis unable to find him or her to resolve the question, the Board will suspendannuity payments.

The month such annuitant's disability ends will bethe first month in which the question arose and the annuitant could notbe found. (4) <T3>Failure of the annuitant to follow prescribed treatment which wouldbe expected to restore the ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</T3>If treatment has been prescribed for the annuitant which would beexpected to restore his or her ability to work, he or she must follow thattreatment in order to be paid a disability annuity. If the annuitant isnot following that treatment and he or she does not have good cause forfailing to follow the treatment, the Board will find that his or her disabilityhas ended.

To assure that disability reviews are carried out ina uniform manner, that decisions of continuing disability can be made inthe most expeditious and administratively efficient way, and that any decisionsto stop a disability annuity are made objectively, neutrally and are fullydocumented, the Board will follow specific steps in reviewing the questionof whether an annuitant's disability continues. The Board's review maycease and the disability may be continued at any point if the Board determinesthat there is sufficient evidence to find that the annuitant is still unableto engage in substantial gainful activity. The steps are_ (a) Is the annuitant engaging in substantial gainful activity? If he orshe is (and any applicable trial work period has been completed), the Boardwill find disability to have ended (see andSection;220.179(a)(5)); (b) If the annuitant is not engaging in substantial gainful activity, doeshe or she have an impairment or combination of impairments which meetsor equals the severity of an impairment listed in Appendix I of this part.If the annuitant's impairment(s) does meet or equal the level of severityof an impairment listed in Appendix I of this part, his or her disabilitywill be found to continue; (c) If the annuitant's impairment(s) does not meet or equal the level ofseverity of an impairment listed in Appendix I of this part, has therebeen medical improvement as defined in andSection;220.177(a)? If there hasbeen medical improvement as shown by a decrease in medical severity, seestep (d). If there has been no decrease in medical severity, then therehas been no medical improvement (See step (e)); (d) If there has been medical improvement, the Board must determine whetherit is related to the annuitant's ability to do work in accordance withparagraphs (a) through (d) of andSection;220.177 (i.e., whether or not therehas been an increase in the residual functional capacity based on the impairment(s)that was present at the time of the most recent favorable medical determination).If medical improvement is <T3>not </T3>related to the annuitant's ability to do work, see step (e).If medical improvement <T3>is </T3>related to the annuitant's ability to do work, see step (f);(e) If the Board found at step (c) that there has been no medical improvmentor if it found at step (d) that the medical improvement is not relatedto the annuitant's ability to work, the Board considers whether any ofthe exceptions in andSection;220.178 apply. If none of them apply, disabilitywill be found to continue. If one of the first group of exceptions to medicalimprovement applies, see step (f). If an exception from the second groupof exceptions to medical improvement applies, disability will be foundto have ended. The second group of exceptions to medical improvement maybe considered at any point in this process; (f) If medical improvement is shown to be related to the annuitant's abilityto do work or if one of the first group of exceptions to medical improvementapplies, the Board will determine whether all of the annuitant's currentimpairments in combination are severe. This determination will considerall current impairments and the impact of the combination of those impairmentson the ability to function. If the residual functional capacity assessmentin step (d) above shows significant limitation of ability to do basic workactivities, see step (g). When the evidence shows that all current impairmentsin combination do not significantly limit physical or mental abilitiesto do basic work activities, these impairments will not be considered severein nature, and the annuitant will no longer be considered to be disabled;(g) If the annuitant's impairment(s) is severe, the Board will assess hisor her current ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. Thatis, the Board will assess the annuitant's residual functional capacitybased on all of his or her current impairments and consider whether heor she can still do work that was done in the past. If he or she can dosuch work, disability will be found to have ended; and (h) If the annuitant is not able to do work he or she has done in the past,the Board will consider one final step. Given the residual functional capacityassessment and considering the annuitant's age, education and past workexperience, can he or she do other work? If the annuitant can do otherwork, disability will be found to have ended. If he or she cannot do otherwork, disability will be found to continue. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.181</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">The month in which the Board will find that the annuitant is no longerdisabled.</ITAG>If the evidence shows that the annuitant is no longer disabled, the Boardwill find that his or her disability ended in the earliest of the followingmonths_(a) The month the Board mails the annuitant a notice saying that the Boardfinds that he or she is no longer disabled based on evidence showing:(1) there has been medical improvement in the annuitant's impairments relatedto the ability to work and the annuitant has the capacity to engage insubstantial gainful work under the rules set out in andSection;andSection;220.177 and 220.178; or(2) there has been no medical improvement in the annuitant's impairmentsrelated to the ability to work but the annuitant has the capacity to engagein substantial gainful work and one of the exceptions to medical improvementset out in andSection; 220.179(a)(1), (2), (3) or (4) applies.(b) The month in which the annuitant demonstrated his or her ability toengage in substantial gainful activity (following completion of a trialwork period);(c) The month in which the annuitant actually does substantial gainfulactivity where such annuitant is not entitled to a trial work period;(d) The month in which the annuitant returns to full-time work, with nosignificant medical restrictions and acknowledges that medical improvementhas occurred, and the Board expected the annuitant's impairment(s) to improve;(e) The first month in which the annuitant failed without good cause todo what the Board asked, when the rule set out in paragraph (b)(2) of andSection;220.179 applies;(f) The first month in which the question of continuing disability aroseand the Board could not locate the annuitant after a suitable investigation(see andSection; 220.179(b)(3));(g) The first month in which the annuitant failed without good cause tofollow prescribed treatment, when the rule set out in paragraph (b)(4)of andSection; 220.179 applies; or(h) The first month the annuitant was told by his or her physician thathe or she could return to work provided there is no substantial conflictbetween that physician's and the annuitant's statements regarding thatannuitant's awareness of his or her capacity for work and the earlier dateis supported by the medical evidence.(i) The month the evidence shows that the annuitant is no longer disabledunder the rules set out in andSection;andSection; 220.177 through 220.180,and he or she was disabled only for a specified period of time in the pastas discussed in andSection; 220.21 or andSection; 220.105;<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.182</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Before a disability annuity is stopped.</ITAG>Before the Board stops a disability annuity, it will give the annuitanta chance to explain why it should not do so.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.183</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Notice that the annuitant is not disabled.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>If the Board determines that the annuitant does not meetthe disability requirements of the law, the disability annuity will generallystop.

The contraction may be eithersymmetrical or irregular. The extent of the remaining peripheral visualfield will be determined by usual perimetric methods at a distance of 330mm. under illumination of not less than 7-foot candles. For the phakiceye (the eye with a lens), a 3 mm. white disc target will be used, andfor the aphakic eye (the eye without the lens), a 6 mm. white disc targetwill be used. In neither instance should corrective spectacle lenses beworn during the examination but if they have been used, this fact mustbe stated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Measurements obtained on comparable perimetric devices may be used;this does not include the use of tangent screen measurements.

The term binocular aphakia would apply to anindividual who has had both lenses removed. In cases of binocular aphakia,the central efficiency of the better eye will be accepted as 75 percentof its value. In cases of monocular aphakia, where the better eye is aphakic,the central visual efficiency will be accepted as 50 percent of the value.(If an individual has binocular aphakia, and the central visual acuityin the poorer eye can be corrected only to 20/200, or less, the centralvisual efficiency of the better eye will be accepted as 50 percent of itsvalue.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Ocular symptoms of systemic disease may or may not produce a disablingvisual impairement.

The most common symptom attributable to these disordersis dyspnea on exertion. Cough, wheezing, sputum production, hemoptysis,and chest pain may also occur, but need not be present. However, sincethese symptoms are common to many other diseases, evaluation of impairmentsof the respiratory system requires a history, physical examination, andchest roentgenogram to establish the diagnosis of a chronic respiratorydisorder. Pulmonary function testing is required to provide a basis forassessing the impairment, once the diagnosis is established by appropriateclinical findings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Alteration of ventilatory function may be due primarily to chronicobstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema, chronic bronchitis, chronic asthmaticbronchitis) or restrictive disorders with primary loss of lung volume (pulmonaryresection, thoracoplasty, chest cage deformity as seen in kyphoscoliosis),or infiltrative interstitial disorders (diffuse fibrosis). Impairment ofgas exchange without significant airway obstruction may be produced byinterstitial disorders (diffuse fibrosis). Primary disease of pulmonarycirculation may produce pulmonary vascular hypertension and, eventually,heart failure. Whatever the mechanism, any chronic progressive pulmonarydisorder may result in cor pulmonale or heart failure. Chronic infectioncaused, most frequently by mycobacterial or mycotic organisms, may produceextensive lung destruction resulting in marked loss of pulmonary functionalcapacity. Some disorders such as bronchiectasis and asthma may be characterizedby acute, intermittent illnesses of such frequency and intensity that theyproduce a marked impairment apart from intercurrent functional loss, whichmay be mild.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Most chronic pulmonary disorders may be adequately evaluated on thebasis of history, physical examination, chest roentgenogram, and ventilatoryfunction tests. Direct assessment of gas exchange by exercise arterialblood gas determination or diffusing capacity is required only in specificrelatively rare circumstances, depending on the clinical features and specificdiagnosis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. <T3>Mycobacterial and mycotic infections of the lung will be evaluated</T3>on the basis of the resulting impairment to pulmonary function. Evidenceof infectious or active mycobacterial or mycotic infection, such as positivecultures, increasing lesions, or cavitation, is not, by itself, a basisfor determining that the individual has a severe impairment which is expectedto last 12 months. However, if these factors are abnormally persistent,they should not be ignored. For example, in those unusual cases where thereis evidence of persistent pulmonary infection caused by mycobacterial ormycotic organisms for a period closely approaching 12 consecutive months,the clinical findings, complications, treatment considerations, and prognosismust be carefully assessed to determine whether, despite the absence ofimpairment of pulmonary function, the individual has a severe impairmentthat can be expected to last for 12 consecutive months.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. <T3>When a respiratory impairment is episodic in nature, </T3>as may occurin complications of bronchiectasis and asthmatic bronchitis, the frequencyof severe episodes despite prescribed treatment is the criterion for determiningthe level of impairment. Documentation for episodic asthma should includethe hospital or emergency room records indicating the dates of treatment,clinical findings on presentation, what treatment was given and for whatperiod of time, and the clinical response. Severe attacks of episodic asthma,as listed in section 3.03B, are defined as prolonged episodes lasting atleast several hours, requiring intensive treatment such as intravenousdrug administration or inhalation therapy in a hospital or emergency room.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D. <T3>Documentation of ventilatory function tests. </T3>The results of ventilatoryfunction studies for evaluation under tables I and II should be expressedin liters or liters per minute (BTPS). The reported one second forced expiratoryvolume (FEV<T2>1</T2>) should represent the largest of at least three attempts. Onesatisfactory maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) is sufficient. The MVVshould represent the observed value and should not be calculated from FEV<T2>1</T2>. These studies should be repeated after administration of anebulized bronchodilator unless the prebronchodilator values are 80 percentor more of predicted normal values or the use of bronchodilators is contraindicated.The values in tables I and II assume that the ventilatory function studieswere not performed in the presence of wheezing or other evidence of bronchospasmor, if these were present at the time of the examination, that the studieswere repeated after administration of a bronchodilator. Ventilatory functionstudies performed in the presence of bronchospasm, without use of bronchodilators,cannot be found to meet the requisite level of severity in tables I andII.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The appropriately labeled spirometric tracing, showing distance persecond on the abscissa and the distance per liter on the ordinate, mustbe incorporated in the file. The manufacturer and model number of the deviceused to measure and record the ventilatory function should be stated. Ifthe spirogram was generated other than by direct pen linkage to a mechanicaldisplacement-type spirometer, the spirometric tracing must show the calibrationof volume units through mechanical means such as would be obtained usinga giant syringe. The FEV<T2>1</T2> must be recorded at a speed of at least 20 mm. per second. Calculationof the FEV<T2>1</T2> from a flow volume loop is not acceptable. The recording devicemust provide a volume excursions of at least 10 mm. per liter. The MVVshould be represented by the tidal excursions measured over a 10- to 15-secondinterval. Tracings showing only cumulative volume for the MVV are not acceptable.The ventilatory function tables are based on measurement of the heightof the individual without shoes. Studies should not be performed duringor soon after an acute respiratory illness. A statement should be madeas to the individual's ability to understand the directions and cooperatein performing the test.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">E. <T3>Documentation of chronic impairment of gas exchange_Arterial bloodgases and exercise tests.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Introduction: </T3>Exercise tests with measurement of arterial bloodgases at rest and during exercise should be purchased when not availableas evidence of record in cases in which there is documentation of chronicpulmonary disease, but the existing evidence, including properly performedventilatory function tests, is not adequate to evaluate the level of theimpairment.

O<T2>2</T2>/kg./min. If a bicycle ergometer is used, an exercise equivalentof 450 kgm./min., or 75 watts, should be used. At the option of the facility,a warm-up period of treadmill walking may be performed to acquaint theapplicant with the procedure. If, during the warm-up period, the individualcannot exercise at the designated level, a lower speed and/or grade maybe selected in keeping with the exercise capacity estimate. The individualshould be monitored by electrocardiogram throughout the exercise and representativestrips taken to provide heart rate in each minute of exercise. During the5th or 6th minute of exercise, an arterial blood gas sample should be drawnand analyzed for PO<T2>2</T2>, PCO<T2>2</T2>, and pH. If the facility has the capability, and at the optionof the DDS and the facility, minute ventilation (BTPS) and oxygen consumptionper minute (STPD) and CO<T2>2</T2> production (STPD) should be measured during the 5th or 6th minuteof exercise.

Thetargeted heart rate should be not less than 85 percent of the maximum predictedheart rate unless it becomes hazardous to exercise to the heart rate orbecomes unnecessary because the ECG meets the criteria in 4.04A at a lowerheart rate (see also 4.00F.2).

For purposes of this Social Security disability program, treadmillexercise testing will be evaluated on the basis of the level at which thetest becomes positive in accordance with the ECG criteria in 404A. However,the significance of findings of a treadmill exercise test must be consideredin light of the clinical course of the disease which may have occurredsubsequent to performance of the exercise test. The criteria in 4.04B arenot applicable if there is documentation of an acceptable treadmill exercisetest, it there is no evidence of a treadmill exercise test or if the testis not acceptable, the criteria in 4.04B should be used. The level of exerciseis considered in terms of multiples of MET's (metabolic equivalent units).One MET is the basal O<T2>2</T2> requirement of the body in an inactive state, sitting quiely.It is considered by most authorities to be approximately 3.5 ml.

Assessment of themagnitude of the impairment following surgery requires adequate documentationof the pertinent evaluations and tests performed following surgery, suchas an interval history and physical examination, with emphasis on thosesigns and symptoms which might have changed postoperatively, as well asX-rays and electrocardiograms. Where treadmill exercise tests or angiographyhave been performed following the surgical procedure, the results of thesetests should be obtained.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Documentation of the preoperative evaluation and a description ofthe surgical procedure are also required.

The level of the impairmentis based on the symptomatology, physical findings, Doppler studies beforeand after a standard exercise test, and/or angiographic findings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The requirements for evaluation of peripheral arterial disease inListing 4.13B are based on the ratio of systolic blood pressure at theankle, determined by Doppler study, to the systolic blood pressure at thebrachial artery determined at the same time. Results of plethysmographicstudies, or other techniques providing systolic blood pressure determinationsat the ankle, should be considered where the information is comparableto the requirements in the listing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Listing 4.13B.1 provides for determining that the listing is met whenthe resting ankle/brachial systolic blood pressure ratio is less than 0.50.Listing 4.13B.2 provides additional criteria for evaluating peripheralarterial impairment on the basis of exercise studies when the resting ankle/brachialsystolic blood pressure ratio is 0.50 or above. The results of exercisestudies should describe the level of exercise (e.g., speed and grade ofthe treadmill settings), the duration of exercise, symptoms during exercise,the reasons for stopping exercise if the expected level of exercise wasnot attained, blood pressures at the ankle and other pertinent levels measuredafter exercise, and the time required to return the systolic blood pressuretoward or to, the preexercise level. When exercise Doppler studies arepurchased by the Social Security Administration, it is suggested that therequested exercise be on a treadmill at 2 mph. on a 12 percent grade for5 minutes.

Blood drug levels should be evaluated in conjunctionwith all the other evidence to determine the extent of compliance. Whenthe reported blood drug levels are low, therefore, the information obtainedfrom the treating source should include the physician's statement as towhy the levels are low and the results of any relevant diagnostic studiesconcerning the blood levels.

The listings for mental disorders are arranged in eight diagnosticcategories: organic mental disorders (12.02); schizophrenic, paranoid andother psychotic disorders (12.03); affective disorders (12.04); mentalretardation and autism (12.05); anxiety related disorders (12.06); somatoformdisorders (12.07); personality disorders (12.08); and substance addictiondisorders (12.09). Each diagnostic group, except listings 12.05 and 12.09,consists of a set of clinical findings (paragraph A criteria), one or moreof which must be met, and which, if met, lead to a test of functional restrictions(paragraph B criteria), two or three of which must also be met. There areadditional considerations (paragraph C criteria) in listings 12.03 and12.06, discussed therein. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The purpose of including the criteria in paragraph A of the listingsfor mental disorders is to medically substantiate the presence of a mentaldisorder. Specific signs and symptoms under any of the listings 12.02 through12.09 cannot be considered in isolation from the description of the mentaldisorder contained at the beginning of each listing category. Impairmentsshould be analyzed or reviewed under the mental category(ies) which issupported by the individual's clinical findings. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The purpose of including the criteria in paragraphs B and C of thelistings for mental disorders is to describe those functional limitationsassociated with mental disorders which are incompatible with the abilityto work. The restrictions listed in paragraphs B and C must be the resultof the mental disorder which is manifested by the clinical findings outlinedin paragraph A. The criteria included in paragraphs B and C of the listingsfor mental disorders have been chosen because they represent functionalareas deemed essential to work. An individual who is severely limited inthese areas as the result of an impairment identified in paragraph A ispresumed to be unable to work. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The structure of the listing for substance addiction disorders, listing12.09, is different from that for the other mental disorder listings. Listing12.09 is structured as a reference listing; that is, it will only serveto indicate which of the other listed mental or physical impairments mustbe used to evaluate the behavioral or physical changes resulting from regularuse of addictive substances. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The listings for mental disorders are so constructed that an individualmeeting or equaling the criteria could not reasonably be expected to engagein gainful work activity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Individuals who have an impairment with a level of severity whichdoes not meet the criteria of the listings for mental disorders may ormay not have the residual functional capacity (RFC) which would enablethem to engage in substantial gainful work activity. The determinationof mental RFC is crucial to the evaluation of an individual's capacityto engage in substantial gainful work activity when the criteria of thelistings for mental disorders are not met or equaled but the impairmentis nevertheless severe.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">RFC may be defined as a multidimensional description of the work-relatedabilities which an individual retains in spite of medical impairments.RFC complements the criteria in paragraphs B and C of the listings formental disorders by requiring consideration of an expanded list of work-relatedcapacities which may be impaired by mental disorder when the impairmentis severe but does not meet or equal a listed mental disorder. (While RFCmay be applicable in most claims, the law specifies that it does not applyto the following special claims categories: disabled title XVI childrenbelow age 18, widows, widowers and surviving divorced wives. The impairment(s)of these categories must meet or equal a listed impairment for the individualto be eligible for benefits based on disability.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. <T3>Need for Medical Evidence:</T3> The existence of a medically determinableimpairment of the required duration must be established by medical evidenceconsisting of clinical signs, symptoms and/or laboratory or psychologicaltest findings. These findings may be intermittent or persistent dependingon the nature of the disorder. Clinical signs are medically demonstrablephenomena which reflect specific abnormalities of behavior, affect, thought,memory, orientation, or contact with reality. These signs are typicallyassessed by a psychiatrist or psychologist and/or documented by psychologicaltests. Symptoms are complaints presented by the individual. Signs and symptomsgenerally cluster together to constitute recognizable clinical syndromes(mental disorders). Both symptoms and signs which are part of any diagnosedmental disorder must be considered in evaluating severity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. <T3>Assessment of Severity:</T3> For mental disorders, severity is assessedin terms of the functional limitations imposed by the impairment. Functionallimitations are assessed using the criteria in paragraph B of the listingsfor mental disorders (descriptions of restrictions of activities of dailyliving; social functioning; concentration, persistence, or pace; and abilityto tolerate increased mental demands associated with competitive work).Where ``marked'' is used as a standard for measuring the degree of limitation,it means more than moderate, but less than extreme. A marked limitationmay arise when several activities or functions are impaired or even whenonly one is impaired, so long as the degree of limitation is such as toseriously interfere with the ability to function independently, appropriatelyand effectively. Four areas are considered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Activities of daily living</T3> include adaptive activities such ascleaning, shopping, cooking, taking public transportation, paying bills,maintaining a residence, caring appropriately for one's grooming and hygiene,using telephones and directories, using a post office, etc. In the contextof the individual's overall situation, the quality of these activitiesis judged by their independence, appropriateness and effectiveness. Itis necessary to define the extent to which the individual is capable ofinitiating and participating in activities independent of supervision ordirection.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Marked'' is not the number of activities which are restricted butthe overall degree of restriction or combination of restrictions whichmust be judged. For example, a person who is able to cook and clean mightstill have marked restrictions of daily activities if the person were toofearful to leave the immediate environment of home and neighborhood, hamperingthe person's ability to obtain treatment or to travel away from the immediateliving environment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Social functioning </T3>refers to an individual's capacity to interactappropriately and communicate effectively with other individuals. Socialfunctioning includes the ability to get along with others, e.g., familymembers, friends, neighbors, grocery clerks, landlords, bus drivers, etc.Impaired social functioning may be demonstrated by a history of altercations,evictions, firings, fear of strangers, avoidance of interpersonal relationships,social isolation, etc. Strength in social functioning may be documentedby an individual's ability to initiate social contacts with others, communicateclearly with others, interact and actively participate in group activities,etc. Cooperative behaviors, consideration for others, awareness of others'feelings, and social maturity also need to be considered. Social functioningin work situations may involve interactions with the public, respondingappropriately to persons in authority, e.g., supervisors, or cooperativebehaviors involving coworkers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Marked'' is not the number of areas in which social functioningis impaired, but the overall degree of interference in a particular areaor combination of areas of functioning. For example, a person who is highlyantagonistic, uncooperative or hostile but is tolerated by local storekeepersmay nevertheless have marked restrictions in social functioning becausethat behavior is not acceptable in other social contexts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Concentration, persistence and pace </T3>refer to the ability to sustainfocused attention sufficiently long to permit the timely completion oftasks commonly found in work settings. In activities of daily living, concentrationmay be reflected in terms of ability to complete tasks in everyday householdroutines. Deficiencies in concentration, persistence and pace are bestobserved in work and work-like settings. Major impairment in this areacan often be assessed through direct psychiatric examination and/or psychologicaltesting, although mental status examination or psychological test dataalone should not be used to accurately describe concentration and sustainedability to adequately perform work-like tasks. On mental status examinations,concentration is assessed by tasks such as having the individual subtractserial sevens from 100. In psychological tests of intelligence or memory,concentration is assessed through tasks requiring short-term memory orthrough tasks that must be completed within established time limits. Inwork evaluations, concentration, persistence, and pace are assessed throughsuch tasks as filing index cards, locating telephone numbers, or disassemblingand reassembling objects. Strengths and weaknesses in areas of concentrationcan be discussed in terms of frequency of errors, time it takes to completethe task, and extent to which assistance is required to complete the task.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Deterioration or decompensation in work or work-like settings </T3>refersto repeated failure to adapt to stressful circumstances which cause theindividual either to withdraw from that situation or to experience exacerbationof signs and symptoms (i.e., decompensation) with an accompanying difficultyin maintaining activities of daily living, social relationships, and/ormaintaining concentration, persistence, or pace (i.e., deterioration whichmay include deterioration of adaptive behaviors). Stresses common to thework environment include decisions, attendance, schedules, completing tasks,interactions with supervisors, interactions with peers, etc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D. <T3>Documentation: </T3>The presence of a mental disorder should be documentedprimarily on the basis of reports from individual providers, such as psychiatristsand psychologists, and facilities such as hospitals and clinics. Adequatedescriptions of functional limitations must be obtained from these or othersources which may include programs and facilities where the individualhas been observed over a considerable period of time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Information from both medical and nonmedical sources may be used toobtain detailed descriptions of the individual's activities of daily living;social functioning; concentration, persistance and pace; or ability totolerate increased mental demands (stress). This information can be providedby programs such as community mental health centers, day care centers,sheltered workshops, etc. It can also be provided by others, includingfamily members, who have knowledge of the individual's functioning. Insome cases descriptions of activities of daily living or social functioninggiven by individuals or treating sources may be insufficiently detailedand/or may be in conflict with the clinical picture otherwise observedor described in the examinations or reports. It is necessary to resolveany inconsistencies or gaps that may exist in order to obtain a properunderstanding of the individual's functional restrictions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An individual's level of functioning may vary considerably over time.The level of functioning at a specific time may seem relatively adequateor, conversely, rather poor. Proper evaluation of the impairment must takeany variations in level of functioning into account in arriving at a determinationof impairment severity over time. Thus, it is vital to obtain evidencefrom relevant sources over a sufficiently long period prior to the dateof adjudication in order to establish the individual's impairment severity.This evidence should include treatment notes, hospital discharge summaries,and work evaluation or rehabilitation progress notes if these are available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some individuals may have attempted to work or may actually have workedduring the period of time pertinent to the determination of disability.This may have been an independent attempt at work, or it may have beenin conjunction with a community mental health or other sheltered programwhich may have been of either short or long duration. Information concerningthe individual's behavior during any attempt to work and the circumstancessurrounding termination of the work effort are particularly useful in determiningthe individual's ability or inability to function in a work setting. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The results of well-standardized psychological tests such as the WechslerAdult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), the Minnesota Multiphasic PersonalityInventory (MMPI), the Rorschach, and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT),may be useful in establishing the existence of a mental disorder. For example,the WAIS is useful in establishing mental retardation, and the MMPI, Rorschach,and TAT may provide data supporting several other diagnoses. Broad-basedneuropsychological assessments using, for example, the Halstead-Reitanor the Luria-Nebraska batteries may be useful in determining brain functiondeficiencies, particularly in cases involving subtle findings such as maybe seen in traumatic brain injury. In addition, the process of taking astandardized test requires concentration, persistence and pace; performanceon such tests may provide useful data. Test results should, therefore,include both the objective data and a narrative description of clinicalfindings. Narrative reports of intellectual assessment should include adiscussion of whether or not obtained IQ scores are considered valid andconsistent with the individual's developmental history and degree of functionalrestriction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In cases involving impaired intellectual functioning, a standardizedintelligence test, e.g., the WAIS, should be administered and interpretedby a psychologist or psychiatrist qualified by training and experienceto perform such an evaluation. In special circumstances, nonverbal measures,such as the Raven Progressive Matrices, the Leiter international scale,or the Arthur adaptation of the Leiter may be substituted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Identical IQ scores obtained from different tests do not always reflecta similar degree of intellectual functioning. In this connection, it mustbe noted that on the WAIS, for example, IQs of 69 and below are characteristicof approximately the lowest 2 percent of the general population. In instanceswhere other tests are administered, it would be necessary to convert theIQ to the corresponding percentile rank in the general population in orderto determine the actual degree of impairment reflected by those IQ scores.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In cases where more than one IQ is customarily derived from the testadministered, i.e., where verbal, performance, and full-scale IQs are providedas on the WAIS, the lowest of these is used in conjunction with listing12.05. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In cases where the nature of the individual's intellectual impairmentis such that standard intelligence tests, as described above, are precluded,medical reports specifically describing the level of intellectual, social,and physical function should be obtained. Actual observations by SocialSecurity Administration or State agency personnel, reports from educationalinstitutions and information furnished by public welfare agencies or otherreliable objective sources should be considered as additional evidence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">E. <T3>Chronic Mental Impairments: </T3>Particular problems are often involvedin evaluating mental impairments in individuals who have long historiesof repeated hospitalizations or prolonged outpatient care with supportivetherapy and medication. Individuals with chronic psychotic disorders commonlyhave their lives structured in such a way as to minimize stress and reducetheir signs and symptoms. Such individuals may be much more impaired forwork than their signs and symptoms would indicate. The results of a singleexamination may not adequately describe these individuals' sustained abilityto function. It is, therefore, vital to review all pertinent informationrelative to the individual's condition, especially at times of increasedstress. It is mandatory to attempt to obtain adequate descriptive informationfrom all sources which have treated the individual either currently orin the time period relevant to the decision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">F. <T3>Effects of Structured Settings: </T3>Particularly in cases involvingchronic mental disorders, overt symptomatology may be controlled or attenuatedby psychosocial factors such as placement in a hospital, board and carefacility, or other environment that provides similar structure. Highlystructured and supportive settings may greatly reduce the mental demandsplaced on an individual. With lowered mental demands, overt signs and symptomsof the underlying mental disorder may be minimized. At the same time, however,the individual's ability to function outside of such a structured and/orsupportive setting may not have changed. An evaluation of individuals whosesymptomatology is controlled or attenuated by psychosocial factors mustconsider the ability of the individual to function outside of such highlystructured settings. (For these reasons the paragraph C criteria were addedto Listings 12.03 and 12.06.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">G. <T3>Effects of Medication: </T3>Attention must be given to the effect ofmedication on the individual's signs, symptoms and ability to function.While psychotropic medications may control certain primary manifestationsof a mental disorder, e.g., hallucinations, such treatment may or may notaffect the functional limitations imposed by the mental disorder. In caseswhere overt symptomatology is attenuated by the psychotropic medications,particular attention must be focused on the functional restrictions whichmay persist. These functional restrictions are also to be used as the measureof impairment severity. (See the paragraph C criteria in Listings 12.03and 12.06.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Neuroleptics, the medicines used in the treatment of some mental illnesses,may cause drowsiness, blunted affect, or other side effects involving otherbody systems. Such side effects must be considered in evaluating overallimpairment severity. Where adverse effects of medications contribute tothe impairment severity and the impairment does not meet or equal the listingsbut is nonetheless severe, such adverse effects must be considered in theassessment of the mental residual functional capacity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">H. <T3>Effect of Treatment: </T3>It must be remembered that with adequatetreatment some individuals suffering with chronic mental disorders notonly have their symptoms and signs ameliorated but also return to a levelof function close to that of their premorbid status. Our discussion herein 12.00H has been designed to reflect the fact that present day treatmentof a mentally impaired individual may or may not assist in the achievementof an adequate level of adaptation required in the work place.

They alsoreflect the analysis of the various vocational factors (i.e., age, education,and work experience) in combination with the individual's residual functionalcapacity (used to determine his or her maximum sustained work capabilityfor sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy work) in evaluatingthe individual's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity in otherthan his or her vocationally relevant past work. Where the findings offact made with respect to a particular individual's vocational factorsand residual functional capacity coincide with all of the criteria of aparticular rule, the rule directs a conclusion as to whether the individualis or is not disabled. However, each of these findings of fact is subjectto rebuttal and the individual may present evidence to refute such findings.Where any one of the findings of fact does not coincide with the correspondingcriterion of a rule, the rule does not apply in that particular case and,accordingly, does not direct a conclusion of disabled or not disabled.In any instance where a rule does not apply, full consideration must begiven to all of the relevant facts of the case in accordance with the definitionsand discussions of each factor in the appropriate sections of the regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The existence of jobs in the national economy is reflected inthe ``Decisions'' shown in the rules; i.e., in promulgating the rules,administrative notice has been taken of the numbers of unskilled jobs thatexist throughout the national economy at the various functional levels(sedentary, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy) as supported by the ``Dictionaryof Occupational Titles'' and the ``Occupational Outlook Handbook,'' publishedby the Department of Labor; the ``County Business Patterns'' and ``CensusSurveys'' published by the Bureau of the Census; and occupational surveysof light and sedentary jobs prepared for the Social Security Administrationby various State employment agencies. Thus, when all factors coincide withthe criteria of a rule, the existence of such jobs is established. However,the existence of such jobs for individuals whose remaining functional capacityor other factors do not coincide with the criteria of a rule must be furtherconsidered in terms of what kinds of jobs or types of work may be eitheradditionally indicated or precluded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) In the application of the rules, the individual's residual functionalcapacity (i.e., the maximum degree to which the individual retains thecapacity for sustained performance of the physical-mental requirementsof jobs), age, education, and work experience must first be determined.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The correct disability decision (i.e., on the issue of abilityto engage in substantial gainful activity) is found by then locating theindividual's specific vocational profile. If an individual's specific profileis not listed within this Appendix 2, a conclusion of disabled or not disabledis not directed. Thus, for example, an individual's ability to engage insubstantial gainful work where his or her residual functional capacityfalls between the ranges of work indicated in the rules (e.g., the individualwho can perform more than light but less than medium work), is decidedon the basis of the principles and definitions in the regulations, givingconsideration to the rules for specific case situations in this Appendix2. These rules represent various combinations of exertional capabilities,age, education and work experience and also provide an overall structurefor evaluation of those cases in which the judgments as to each factordo not coincide with those of any specific rule. Thus, when the necessaryjudgments have been made as to each factor and it is found that no specificrule applies, the rules still provide guidance for decisionmaking, suchas in cases involving combinations of impairments. For example, if strengthlimitations resulting from an individual's impairment(s) considered withthe judgments made as to the individual's age, education and work experiencecorrespond to (or closely approximate) the factors of a particular rule,the adjudicator then has a frame of reference for considering the jobsor types of work precluded by other, nonexertional impairments in termsof numbers of jobs remaining for a particular individual.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) Since the rules are predicated on an individual's having an impairmentwhich manifests itself by limitations in meeting the strength requirementsof jobs, they may not be fully applicable where the nature of an individual'simpairment does not result in such limitations, e.g., certain mental, sensory,or skin impairments. In addition, some impairments may result solely inpostural and manipulative limitations or environmental restrictions. Environmentalrestrictions are those restrictions which result in inability to toleratesome physical feature(s) of work settings that occur in certain industriesor types of work, e.g., an inability to tolerate dust or fumes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) In the evaluation of disability where the individual has solelya nonexertional type of impairment, determination as to whether disabilityexists shall be based on the principles in the appropriate sections ofthe regulations, giving consideration to the rules for specific case situationsin this Appendix 2. The rules do not direct factual conclusions of disabledor not disabled for individuals with solely nonexertional types of impairments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) However, where an individual has an impairment or combinationof impairments resulting in both strength limitations and nonexertionallimitations, the rules in this subpart are considered in determining firstwhether a finding of disabled may be possible based on the strength limitationsalone and, if not, the rule(s) reflecting the individual's maximum residualstrength capabilities, age, education, and work experience provide a frameworkfor consideration of how much the individual's work capability is furtherdiminished in terms of any types of jobs that would be contraindicatedby the nonexertional limitations. Also, in these combinations of nonexertionaland exertional limitations which cannot be wholly determined under therules in this Appendix 2, full consideration must be given to all of therelevant facts in the case in accordance with the definitions and discussionsof each factor in the appropriate sections of the regulations, which willprovide insight into the adjudicative weight to be accorded each factor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">201.00 <T3>Maximum sustained work capability limited to sedentary work as a resultof severe medically determinable impairment(s). </T3>(a) Most sedentaryoccupations fall within the skilled, semi-skilled, professional, administrative,technical, clerical, and benchwork classifications. Approximately 200 separateunskilled sedentary occupations can be identified, each representing numerousjobs in the national economy. Approximately 85 percent of these jobs arein the machine trades and benchwork occupational categories. These jobs(unskilled sedentary occupations) may be performed after a short demonstrationor within 30 days.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) These unskilled sedentary occupations are standard within theindustries in which they exist. While sedentary work represents a significantlyrestricted range of work, this range in itself is not so prohibitivelyrestricted as to negate work capability for substantial gainful activity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Vocational adjustment to sedentary work may be expected wherethe individual has special skills or experience relevant to sedentary workor where age and basic educational competences provide sufficient occupationalmobility to adapt to the major segment of unskilled sedentary work. Inabilityto engage in substantial gainful activity would be indicated where an individualwho is restricted to sedentary work because of a severe medically determinableimpairment lacks special skills or experience relevant to sedentary work,lacks educational qualifications relevant to most sedentary work (e.g.,has a limited education or less) and the individual's age, though not necessarilyadvanced, is a factor which significantly limits vocational adaptability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The adversity of functional restrictions to sedentary work atadvanced age (55 and over) for individuals with no relevant past work orwho can no longer perform vocationally relevant past work and have no transferableskills, warrants a finding of disabled in the the absence of the rare situationwhere the individual has recently completed education which provides abasis for direct entry into skilled sedentary work. Advanced age and ahistory of unskilled work or no work experience would ordinarily offsetany vocational advantages that might accrue by reason of any remote pasteducation, whether it is more or less than limited education.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) The presence of acquired skills that are readily transferableto a significant range of skilled work within an individual's residualfunctional capacity would ordinarily warrant a finding of ability to engagein substantial gainful activity regardless of the adversity of age, orwhether the individual's formal education is commensurate with his or herdemonstrated skill level. The acquisition of work skills demonstrates theability to perform work at the level of complexity demonstrated by theskill level attained regardless of the individual's formal educationalattainments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) In order to find transferability of skills to skilled sedentarywork for individuals who are of advanced age (55 and over), there mustbe very little, if any, vocational adjustment required in terms of tools,work processes, work settings, or the industry.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(g) Individuals approaching advanced age (age 50-54) may be significantlylimited in vocational adaptability if they are restricted to sedentarywork. When such individuals have no past work experience or can no longerperform vocationally relevant past work and have no transferable skills,a finding of disabled ordinarily obtains. However, recently completed educationwhich provides for direct entry into sedentary work will preclude sucha finding. For this age group, even a high school education or more (ordinarilycompleted in the remote past) would have little impact for effecting avocational adjustment unless relevant work experience reflects use of sucheducation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(h) The term ``younger individual'' is used to denote an individualage 18 through 49. For those within this group who are age 45-49, age isa less positive factor than for those who are age 18-44. Accordingly, forsuch individuals; (1) who are restricted to sedentary work, (2) who areunskilled or have no transferable skills, (3) who have no relevant pastwork or who can no longer perform vocationally relevant past work, and(4) who are either illiterate or unable to communicate in the English language,a finding of disabled is warranted. On the other hand, age is a more positivefactor for those who are under age 45 and is usually not a significantfactor in limiting such an individual's ability to make a vocational adjustment,even an adjustment to unskilled sedentary work, and even where the individualis illiterate or unable to communicate in English. However, a finding ofdisabled is not precluded for those individuals under age 45 who do notmeet all of the criteria of a specific rule and who do not have the abilityto perform a full range of sedentary work. The following examples are illustrative:Example 1: An individual under age 45 with a high school education canno longer do past work and is restricted to unskilled sedentary jobs becauseof a severe medically determinable cardiovascular impairment (which doesnot meet or equal the listings in Appendix 1). A permanent injury of theright hand limits the individual to sedentary jobs which do not requirebilateral manual dexterity. None of the rules in Appendix 2 are applicableto this particular set of facts, because this individual cannot performthe full range of work defined as sedentary. Since the inability to performjobs requiring bilateral manual dexterity significantly compromises theonly range of work for which the individual is otherwise qualified (i.e.,sedentary), a finding of disabled would be appropriate. Example 2: An illiterate41 year old individual with mild mental retardation (IQ of 78) is restrictedto unskilled sedentary work and cannot perform vocationally relevant pastwork, which had consisted of unskilled agricultural field work; his orher particular characteristics do not specifically meet any of the rulesin Appendix 2, because this individual cannot perform the full range ofwork defined as sedentary. In light of the adverse factors which furthernarrow the range of sedentary work for which this individual is qualified,a finding of disabled is appropriate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) While illiteracy or the inability to communicate in English maysignificantly limit an individual's vocational scope, the primary workfunctions in the bulk of unskilled work relate to working with things (ratherthan with data or people) and in these work functions at the unskilledlevel, literacy or ability to communicate in English has the least significance.Similarly the lack of relevant work experience would have little significancesince the bulk of unskilled jobs require no qualifying work experience.Thus, the functional capability for a full range of sedentary work representssufficient numbers of jobs to indicate substantial vocational scope forthose individuals age 18-44 even if they are illiterate or unable to communicatein English. </ITAG><ITAG

Approximately 1,600separate sedentary and light unskilled occupations can be identified ineight broad occupational categories, each occupation representing numerousjobs in the national economy. These jobs can be performed after a shortdemonstration or within 30 days, and do not require special skills or experience.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The functional capacity to perform a wide or full range of lightwork represents substantial work capability compatible with making a workadjustment to substantial numbers of unskilled jobs and, thus, generallyprovides sufficient occupational mobility even for severely impaired individualswho are not of advanced age and have sufficient educational competencesfor unskilled work.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) However, for individuals of advanced age who can no longer performvocationally relevant past work and who have a history of unskilled workexperience, or who have only skills that are not readily transferable toa significant range of semi-skilled or skilled work that is within theindividual's functional capacity, or who have no work experience, the limitationsin vocational adaptability represented by functional restriction to lightwork warrant a finding of disabled. Ordinarily, even a high school educationor more which was completed in the remote past will have little positiveimpact on effecting a vocational adjustment unless relevant work experiencereflects use of such education.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) Where the same factors in paragraph (c) of this section regardingeducation and work experience are present, but where age, though not advanced,is a factor which significantly limits vocational adaptability (i.e., closelyapproaching advanced age, 50-54) and an individual's vocational scope isfurther significantly limited by illiteracy or inability to communicatein English, a finding of disabled is warranted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) The presence of acquired skills that are readily transferableto a significant range of semi-skilled or skilled work within an individual'sresidual functional capacity would ordinarily warrant a finding of notdisabled regardless of the adversity of age, or whether the individual'sformal education is commensurate with his or her demonstrated skill level.The acquisition of work skills demonstrates the ability to perform workat the level of complexity demonstrated by the skill level attained regardlessof the individual's formal educational attainments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) For a finding of transferability of skills to light work for individualsof advanced age who are closely approaching retirement age (age 60-64),there must be very little, if any, vocational adjustment required in termsof tools, work processes, work settings, or the industry.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(g) While illiteracy or the inability to communicate in English maysignificantly limit an individual's vocational scope, the primary workfunctions in the bulk of unskilled work relate to working with things (ratherthan with data or people) and in these work functions at the unskilledlevel, literacy or ability to communicate in English has the least significance.Similarly, the lack of relevant work experience would have little significancesince the bulk of unskilled jobs require no qualifying work experience.The capability for light work, which includes the ability to do sedentarywork, represents the capability for substantial numbers of such jobs. This,in turn, represents substantial vocational scope for younger individuals(age 18-49) even if illiterate or unable to communicate in English. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,xs48,r45,r70,r70,xs48</C><T4>Table No. </T4>2_<T4>Residual Functional Capacity: Maximum Sustained Work Capability Limitedto Light Work as a Result of Severe Medically Determinable Impairment(s)</T4><H1>Rule</H1><H1>Age</H1><H1>Education</H1><H1>Previous work experience</H1><H1>Decision</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">202.01<D>Advanced age</D><D>Limited or less</D><D>Unskilled or none</D><D>Disabled.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.02<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills not transferable</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.03<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills transferable\1\</D><D>Not disabled.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.04<D>......do</D><D>High school graduate or more_does not provide for direct entry intoskilled work\2\</D><D>Unskilled or none</D><D>Disabled.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.05<D>......do</D><D>High school graduate or more_provides for direct entry into skilledwork\2\</D><D>......do</D><D>Not disabled.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.06<D>......do</D><D>High school graduate or more_does not provide for direct entry intoskilled work\2\</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills not transferable</D><D>Disabled.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.07<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills transferable\2\</D><D>Not disabled.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.08<D>......do</D><D>High school graduate or more_provides for direct entry into skilledwork\2\</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills not transferable</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.09<D>Closely approaching advanced age</D><D>Illiterate or unable to communicate in English</D><D>Unskilled or none</D><D>Disabled.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.10<D>......do</D><D>Limited or less_At least literate and able to communicate in English</D><D>......do</D><D>Not disabled.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.11<D>......do</D><D>Limited or less</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills not transferable</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.12<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills transferable</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.13<D>......do</D><D>High school graduate or more</D><D>Unskilled or none</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.14<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills not transferable</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.15<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills transferable</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.16<D>Younger individual</D><D>Illiterate or unable to communicate in English</D><D>Unskilled or none</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.17<D>......do</D><D>Limited or less_At least literate and able to communicate in English</D><D>......do</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.18<D>......do</D><D>Limited or less</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills not transferable</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.19<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills transferable</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.20<D>......do</D><D>High school graduate or more</D><D>Unskilled or none</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.21<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills not transferable</D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">202.22<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>Skilled or semiskilled_skills transferable</D><D>  Do.</D><F>\1\See 202.00(f).</F><F>\2\See 202.00(c).</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">203.00 <T3>Maximum sustained work capability limited to medium work as a resultof severe medically determinable impair- ment(s).</T3> (a) The functionalcapacity to perform medium work includes the functional capacity to performsedentary, light, and medium work. Approximately 2,500 separate sedentary,light, and medium occupations can be identified, each occupation representingnumerous jobs in the national economy which do not require skills or previousexperience and which can be performed after a short demonstration or within30 days.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The functional capacity to perform medium work represents suchsubstantial work capability at even the unskilled level that a findingof disabled is ordinarily not warranted in cases where a severely impairedindividual retains the functional capacity to perform medium work. Eventhe adversity of advanced age (55 or over) and a work history of unskilledwork may be offset by the substantial work capability represented by thefunctional capacity to perform medium work. However, an individual witha marginal education and long work experience (i.e., 35 years or more)limited to the performance of arduous unskilled labor, who is not workingand is no longer able to perform this labor because of a severe impairment(s),may still be found disabled even though the individual is able to do mediumwork.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) However, the absence of any relevant work experience becomes amore significant adversity for individuals of advanced age (55 and over).Accordingly, this factor, in combination with a limited education or less,militates against making a vocational adjustment to even this substantialrange of work and a finding of disabled is appropriate.
