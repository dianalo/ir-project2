The order also is indicative of an airline that picks itsequipment in a smart, precise way, says a spokesman an aircraftmaker that lost out on the deal.   Fort Worth, Texas-based American scheduled a news conference fortoday to disclose details of its purchase, which some industryexperts believe could total $7 billion. The airline is expected toorder 50 to 60 MD-11 jumbo jets and as many as 100 smaller MD-80twinjets from McDonnell Douglas Corp.   The purchase would be the first huge aircraft order in 1989,after a year that saw at least nine carriers _ including American _place jet orders for $1 billion or more.   They included a $5.04 billion order in May by International LeaseFinance Corp. for 130 planes from Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie,and a September order-and-option package by Delta Air Lines for 215planes, split between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, that could beworth $6 billion to $10 billion.   The big three commercial jet builders shattered order records in1988. Boeing, with about two-thirds of the market, announced firmorders for 636 planes worth $30.1 billion, surpassing 1987 orders by49 percent. McDonnell Douglas had orders for 246 planes and Airbus,the European consortium, 167, but neither announced dollar values.   Few believe 1989 will approach those marks, but Boeing estimatesthere's plenty of room in the new plane market _ more than $450billion worth, in 1989 dollars, between now and 2005.   Demand for new planes is so great that it's tough for operatorsto get them when they want them.   ``In general, the industry is running flat-out at capacity and ispretty much booked into the 1992-93 time frame,'' Wolfgang Demisch,aerospace industry analyst for Union Bank of Switzerland in NewYork, said Monday. Being able to provide delivery spots ``seems atleast one factor in American deciding for the MD-11, besides whatmay be a very advantageous price.''   MD-11s normally sell for $90 million to $100 million, butanalysts said American's actual purchase price could be for $80million to $85 million each, partly because of the large numberordered.   American already has 118 MD-80s and 60 DC-10s, a predecessor tothe MD-11, along with a wide variety of Boeing jets.   The MD-11 is a three-engine widebody, capable of carrying 405passengers 8,000 miles. McDonnell Douglas bills it as a long-hauljet to serve routes that don't have the passenger volume to justifya Boeing 747. Boeing's new 747-400 also can fly 8,000 miles,carrying about 479 passengers.   Boeing was at a disadvantage, said analyst William Whitlow Jr. atDain Bosworth Co. in Seattle, since American flies such routes asDallas-Tokyo, with fewer passengers than, say, Tokyo-Los Angeles.   ``It just looks to me that they probably weren't in the huntbased on what they are able to provide,'' Whitlow said. ``The 747 isso much bigger.''   Boeing is considering a smaller long-haul plane, a new version ofits 767 widebody, but that's only in the talking stage. Airbus istaking orders for its four-engine A340, which will carry about 295passengers 7,500 miles, but Airbus spokesman David Venz in Herndon,Va., said it was effectively eliminated from the American biddingbecause the first A340 won't be available until 1992.   Likewise, Venz said, Airbus would have loved to sell American aslew of its hot-selling A320s, a smaller plane that competes withthe twin-jet MD-80 and Boeing's 737 family. But ``we're essentiallysold out on that airplane up to the '92-93 period,'' he said.   Boeing spokesman David Jimenez said Monday there is a waitingperiod for new Boeing jets, negotiable with each order, but``usually a couple of years out.'' He said he did not haveparticulars on the pending American order, but said Boeing hadtalked to American about buying planes.   Don Hanson, McDonnell Douglas spokesman in Long Beach, Calif.,said his company's delivery dates generally extend into 1993.   ``However, there are always ways to be able to swap deliverypositions to satisfy a customer,'' Hanson said. He declined todiscuss the American order Monday.   Though American may favor McDonnell Douglas today, it has spreadits business in the past. Airbus is delivering 25 A300-600Rwidebodies that American ordered in 1987, and American last yeargave Boeing a $2 billion order for 50 mid-sized 757s, with optionsfor 50 more.   Venz said American officials like to get the precise plane forthe job.   ``They buy in a very smart and sophisticated way. They go out andlook at the market and look at what airplanes are there to dospecific jobs. That can bring them great rewards,'' he said.   Analysts say the need to replace aging fleets has spurred therecent orders.   Traumas involving older planes, including the accident lastspring in which the top came off an Aloha Airlines 737 over Hawaii,focused attention on the safety of older jets. Airplane makers,regulators and operators say a jet is safe to fly indefinitely ifproperly maintained, but note that maintenance costs climb with anaircraft's age.   Also, many older planes don't meet tougher noise regulations,burn more fuel and require a crew of three instead of two, theconfiguration of many newer jets.</TEXT></DOC>
