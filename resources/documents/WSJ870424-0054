To get a silk blouse dry-cleaned, the New Yorker recently paid $6, up 33% from the $4.50 she paid less than a year ago. &quot;You can buy the blouse in China for what they now want to clean it,&quot; she complains.    Although economists are just beginning to worry that inflation is reawakening after a five-year slumber, consumers such as Ms. Barbanel say they noticed its early stirrings months ago.    That's because prices of commonly used goods and services that shape consumers' perceptions about inflation -- things such as toothpaste, coffee, haircuts and taxi rides -- are soaring even though the overall rise in the cost of living continues moderate.    &quot;Consumers have a gnawing suspicion that there is more inflation out there than is captured in official government statistics -- and the skepticism is justified,&quot; says Irwin Kellner, the chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.    In a recent survey, the New York bank found that prices of these so-called nuisance items are rising three to four times faster than the government's consumer price index. The bank's nuisance index, which consists of three dozen goods and services commonly purchased during a month's time, rose at an average rate of 15% a year in 1985 and 1986.    Meanwhile, the government's closely watched CPI -- which gives more weight to expensive items such as houses and cars -- rose only 3.8% in 1985 and a scant 1.1% last year. Although the CPI ran at a compound annual rate of 5.2% in February -- the highest in several years -- it still doesn't capture the speed of many price spirals.    Some economists contend that the nuisance index may provide a truer picture of how inflation is depleting consumers' pocketbooks. Along with the way the sagging dollar is pushing up prices of many imports and of some competing domestic goods, the rising nuisance index suggests that overall inflation will accelerate in coming months.    Rising prices of nuisance items can alter spending patterns. Consumers forced to spend ever more money on small, everyday necessities may be unable to afford cars, appliances and other major purchases. For the growing number of retired Americans rarely in the market for big-ticket durables, the nuisance index is the crucial cost-of-living measure.    Raymond DeVoe terms it the &quot;piranha&quot; factor. A jump in a hairdresser's or housekeeper's bill &quot;won't devour your budget at once the way an auto-price increase will, but those small bites are sharp and can be just as painful,&quot; the economist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. says.    And they are multiplying. For example, the cost of hiring skilled services workers such as barbers, beauticians, housekeepers and shoe repairers is rising 10% to 20% a year, statistics show.    &quot;Paying for a haircut and perm has become a capital expenditure,&quot; says Arleyne Byers, a Pittsburgh insurance agent. She now pays $60 for the combination, up 33% from $45 last year.    Service operators defend the price increases as necessary to cover their own rising costs. Angelo Sicilia, who owns a New York barbershop, recently raised prices 14% after his rent and utilities increased and as his employees asked for pay raises. &quot;I tried to absorb the increases for a while, but my back was up against the wall,&quot; says Mr. Sicilia, who now charges $8 for a shave, up $1.    Among the most noticeable increases are insurance premiums, which are climbing about 10% a year nationally and rose as much as 40% last year in some states. For Douglas Mason, higher rates this year translated into total annual premiums of $1,900 for his three cars, up from $1,500. The 37-year-old Fort Washington, Md., education consultant is paying more even though he has an unblemished driving record.    For Social Security beneficiaries and others whose benefit payments are pegged to changes in the CPI, rapidly rising prices for day-to-day items such as liquid detergent, a pound of coffee and a magazine can trim the gains that they receive through cost-of-living allowances. Kathleen Scholl, an economist at the American Association of Retired Persons, finds that people over 65 years old spend about 8.3% of their incomes on food, household supplies and personal-care services, compared with 7% for 35- to 40-year-olds.    Such prices are rising, in part, because the stores in which such goods are sold are labor-intensive operations and can't count on gains in productivity -- as do manufacturers -- to offset their own rising labor and rental costs. In addition, these businesses often hold local monopolies for the goods they sell and benefit from the lack of competition -- above all, import competition. &quot;You won't go to Korea to buy a hamburger because the local coffee shop raised prices,&quot; says Sandra Shaber, a consumer economist at the Futures Group in Washington, D.C.    In the service sector, a major factor tending to enable suppliers to keep raising prices is what economists call &quot;imperfect&quot; competition. They note that consumers seldom shop around and compare prices for small-tag goods and services as they do when buying big-ticket goods. &quot;Consumers will drive across town to find a good deal on a dishwasher but seldom travel far to a dry cleaners,&quot; Ms. Shaber explains.    The price surge in small items bodes ill for the overall outlook. &quot;Prices of small-ticket items tend to lead inflation and tend to accelerate rather rapidly once you get into an inflationary mode,&quot; says Lacy Hunt, an economist at Carroll McEntee andamp; McGinley Inc. in New York. &quot;They are an indication that generalized inflation is taking root.&quot;    However, the overall inflation still seems too moderate to spark the sort of anticipatory buying that aggravated the problem in the late 1970s. Then, when inflation was surging at double-digit rates and price changes were rapid, consumers tended to buy goods out of fear that if they waited, they would soon have to pay more. In recent years, the ebbing of inflation changed attitudes -- at least temporarily.    Recent economic research indicates that rising prices are beginning to damp, rather than spur, consumer spending. Also discouraging any spending sprees are the current slow gains in consumer income and the fact that as the economic expansion ages, more and more consumers have already bought what they might have wanted for some time. Government retail-sales figures for the 1987 first quarter show that consumers have started to pull back as rising prices &quot;pinch&quot; consumers' pocketbooks, Ms. Shaber says.    Eleanor Moye, a Pittsburgh banker, considers herself pinched these days. After allocating more of her income to pay for parking fees, groceries, maid service and child care, she and her husband recently canceled plans to purchase new appliances and furniture. Her monthly parking bill recently climbed to $155 from $135, child-care costs for this summer are rising to $40 a week from just $15 two years ago, and maid service now costs $25 a visit, up from $15 earlier this year.    &quot;I can live without new home furnishings and appliances, but I can't work in the office all day and iron shirts all evening,&quot; Mrs. Moye says.    The phenomenon of fast-rising nuisance prices isn't new. But in the late 1970s and early 1980s, prices of small-ticket items rose more slowly than the CPI and therefore went unnoticed. Now that they are rising much faster, they are rattling nerves.    Between December 1979 and December 1980, for example, prices of food, apparel, services, and incidentals such as postage and personal-care products -- CPI components that include some of the items also making up Manufacturers Hanover's nuisance index -- rose 8.08% while the overall CPI surged 12.38%. In December 1986, in contrast, the 12-month percentage change for those small items was 5.9%, compared with 1.2% for overall inflation.    Mr. Kellner's index isn't the only one signaling sharp price rises for familiar consumer &quot;incidentals.&quot; Legg Mason's Mr. DeVoe has compiled what he calls the &quot;trivia index&quot; of 45 items ranging from a Baskin-Robbins ice-cream cone and a Brooks Brothers necktie to an X-rated greeting card and a Chinese takeout dinner of diced chicken with pine nuts. Overall, the items on his index have climbed three to four times faster than the CPI in the past two years.    Among recent changes from prices two years ago: A caddie fee for 18 holes of golf has jumped to $20 from $12, the charge for an hour of racketball time at a Wall Street athletic club has soared to $75 from $54, and that Chinese takeout has gone up to $6.25 from $5.25.    Some of the dramatic differences in private and government inflation measures reflect their differing methodologies. Economists Kellner and DeVoe take a random sample of prices from one period to the next and calculate percentage changes. (Mr. Kellner now is developing a more sophisticated index based on the CPI.) The government's measurements, in contrast, are far more complex. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks how prices change within a fixed &quot;market basket&quot; of goods and services designed to represent total consumer spending. Each product then gets a weight in proportion to its relative importance as a percentage of total expenditures.    Because consumers spend a greater proportion of their incomes on big-ticket durables -- cars, furniture and appliances -- this group is weighted heavily in tracking price trends, even though most people buy such items infrequently and some postpone such purchases for a long time. The so-called nuisance items, which, ironically, can't be postponed and are purchased often, get a small weight.    As a result, lower prices of durable goods -- many of which can be imported -- could pull down inflation, while higher personal-services costs could go unnoticed.    The CPI also fails to take into account variations in spending patterns that might arise from changes in prices or consumer tastes. A family that spends 10% of its annual income on gasoline one year might spend considerably less the following year because higher pump prices persuaded it to drive less or because it purchased a new, fuel-efficient car. The government recently revised the CPI to factor in such trends, but the index still can't easily measure nickel and dime items.    Some economists say consumers shouldn't get too upset over climbing prices of nuisance items. Ms. Shaber says consumers &quot;get mad when prices of things they really want start to rise&quot; but quickly forget about prices that have fallen. Price declines for gasoline, farm produce and some electronic products, such as videocassette recorders, microwave ovens and radios, have offset the rising prices of small-ticket items.    That's little comfort to Linda Barbanel. After the shock of the hefty dry-cleaning bill wore off, the 40-year-old psychoanalyst raised the fee she charges for an office visit to $60 from $45. &quot;I have to cover my costs, too,&quot; she explains.    ---           Two Measures of Consumer Price Changes                     The Nuisance Index                          JAN.
