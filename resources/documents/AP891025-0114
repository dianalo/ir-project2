WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House today sustained President Bush'sveto of a bill that would have allowed federally financed Medicaidabortions for victims of rape and incest.   The vote was 231 to 191 in favor of override, but that fell 51votes short of the two-thirds margin needed.   Abortion-rights supporters, who had won a surprising victory twoweeks ago for more liberal abortion provisions, failed in today'svote to end a prohibition that has been written in federal law fornearly a decade.   Supporters of expanding federally financed abortions for poorwomen had acknowledged they faced a difficult task in trying toraise a two-thirds House majority for an override. They won a216-206 vote two weeks ago.   An override also would have require two-thirds approval by theSenate.   The vote followed an emotion-packed debate on the House floor,in which abortion-rights forces condemned Bush's veto as anunconscionable infringement on the rights of poor women andchildren victimized by rape and incest _ and one that will bringpolitical damage to Republicans.   Abortion foes cast the issue as a moral one that would invitewidespread federal financing of abortions.   ``This president can't stop (Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio)Noriega. He can't decide what to do to roll back communism ... Butboy, can he show the poor women of this country who's boss,'' saidRep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., a leader of abortion-rights lawmakers.   ``If you're a poor woman, George Bush is saying to you, `Justsay no to rape; Just say no to incest.' What a leader,'' Aucoinsaid.   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., a leader of the anti-abortionforces, said the measure was ``vague, imprecise, and if enactedinto law might open the floodgates to aboriton funding.''   Another abortion foe, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said, ``I haveletters here from women who have been raped who say, `Thank God Ididn't have an abortion.'''   In an indication of how politically difficult the issue wasregarded, the House Republican leader, Rep. Robert Michel, R-Ill.,said he would vote with Bush while suggesting he could changepositions later.   ``I'm obliged obviously as the leader to support the presidentin this effort,'' Michel said. ``That isn't to say that sometimedown the road that position won't be modified to some degree, but Ithink we ought to talk about it.''   The liberalized abortion language passed the House on a 216-206vote two weeks ago. The measure, which cleared the Senate by awider margin, is part of a $156.7 billion appropriations bill foreducation, labor and health programs.   One Democrat who had voted against the liberalization told theHouse today he would change positions and vote to overrride. Rep.William Natcher, D-Ky., chairman of the appropriations subcommitteethat wrote the spending bill, said ``I like George Bush. ... ButMr. Speaker, he's wrong this time.''   Bush said he was seeking ``room for flexibility'' on the issueimmediately after the House vote. But under pressure fromanti-abortion supporters he hardened his stand and vetoed the billSaturday.   Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today thepassage of tougher restrictions on abortion by the PennsylvaniaHouse on Tuesday ``certainly does show that there's strong feelingson both sides of this issue.'' He said the president has no plansto campaign for passage of state laws restricting abortion.   On Tuesday, freshman Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., reversedhis previous stand and said he would vote in favor of an override.   ``I think it's wrong for me as a congressman to dictate to women... what decision they should make in the case of rape andincest,'' said Pallone, who added he remains personally opposed toabortion.   The abortion provision would reverse a law in effect since 1981that bans all Medicaid abortions for poor women except when themother's life is endangered by her pregnancy.   Although the Senate has endorsed more liberal abortionprovisions, the House in previous years insisted on keeping thecurrent law. The House vote two weeks ago to accept the Senateversion surprised even its supporters.   The disputed provision would allow Medicaid funding of abortionsin cases of rape or incest, when the victim ``reported promptly''to health or law authorities.   Although that was expected to cover a relatively narrow categoryof women, the issue has taken on broader symbolic importance in thepolitical fight over abortion.   It comes at a time when abortion rights supporters say they arebenefiting from a changed political climate after the Supreme Courtlast summer gave the states more room to regulate abortions. Thatruling, they contend, has energized abortion rights supporters andmade voters more wary of efforts to impose new restrictions.</TEXT></DOC>
