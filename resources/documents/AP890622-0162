Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs,said he will talk to South African government officials and leadersof the outlawed African National Congress during a trip to theregion in July.   He spoke from Washington in a special U.S. Information Servicehookup with four South African cities.   Cohen repeatedly mentioned ``the new government of SouthAfrica,'' apparently referring to the fact that National Partyleader F.W. de Klerk is expected to replace retiring P.W. Botha aspresident after September parliamentary elections. They excludevoting by the 28 million black majority.   The National Party, which has ruled South Africa for 41 years, isvirtually certain to remain in power.   Cohen said he will visit Lusaka, Zambia, and tell exiled leadersof the ANC, South Africa's biggest guerrilla organization: ``I'mexpecting the new South African government to be coming up with someinteresting proposals. If the new government proposed a dialogue,will you be ready?''   If Pretoria lifts a four-year state of emergency, Cohen said,``there has to be a reciprocal element that political activity wouldbe nonviolent.''   He said this ``will be one of the major topics'' when AlbertinaSisulu, co-president of the banned United Democratic Front, meetsPresident Bush next week. Mrs. Sisulu is prohibited from speaking inpublic or leaving her home at night without permission. The passportallowing her to visit Bush is the first granted her and is valid foronly 30 days.   Cohen said a visit to Washington by de Klerk still is ``thesubject of diplomatic discussions.''   He gave an overview of the Bush administration's Africa policy,noting it still is under review.   ``You will see probably a more activist role of the United Stateson the issue of internal constitutional change in South Africa. Whatwe'd like to do is be more active in promoting a dialogue betweenthe government and the black leadership. I think we could be acatalyst.''   He said the Reagan administration had concentrated on U.N.Resolution 435 bringing independence to Namibia and the withdrawalof Cuban troops from Angola _ settled by a transition plan now underway.   ``The next priority of our policy is trying to promote settlementin South Africa itself,'' Cohen said. ``The successful completion of435 could lead to more peacemaking. Mozambique and Angola (whererebels are fighting Marxist governments) are ready for peacemakingefforts.''   He said the United States helped develop an African summit toresolve the Angolan civil war that began Thursday in Zaire. ``We mayhave a breakthrough,'' Cohen said.   He also saw a ``greater effort at multilateral diplomacy'' insouthern Africa _ coordinating with former colonizers Portugal, theUnited Kingdom and West Germany _ and ``greater cohesion'' in theU.S. Congress.   ``We welcome South Africa's new diplomatic effort in SouthernAfrica. It has changed from a policy of destabilization to one ofcooperation,'' Cohen said.   ``Sanctions have had a very major impact on development of newthinking in South Africa,'' he said, but Bush wants to concentrateon dialogue.   ``But you cannot even begin that without the release of blackleaders and the lifting of the emergency so non-violent politicalactivity can take place.   ``If progress on these lines is not made within two years of thenew government it would be difficult for the U.S. to hold backforces demanding increased pressure, and it would be difficult forWestern Europe and Japan as well.''</TEXT></DOC>
