The only elementalspecies that can be detected with reasonable sensitivity as negativeions are the halogens. For these ions, calibration curves are linearover at least four orders of magnitude and detection limits range from10 to 400 ng/mL. Other characteristics that are evaluated include isotoperatios, matrix effects caused by the associated cation or the anion speciation,and polyatomic-ion formation.</TEXT></DOC>
