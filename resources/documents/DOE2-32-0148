Withindisturbances structure bow and backward shock waves, magnetic cloudsand interaction area between clouds are identified. Comparative investigationof disturbances from ball weak flares doublet 1n 15 -16.01 and from moreenergetic flares doublet 2n 14 - 15.02 are conducted. Normals to shockfronts and cloud boundaries correlate with disturbance specific flatnessconcept.</TEXT></DOC>
