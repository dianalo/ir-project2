The Foreign Ministry statement came two days after theVietnamese government announced its withdrawal plan. Vietnaminvaded Cambodia in 1978 and has battled Chinese-backed guerrillasever since.   ``Despite Vietnam's repeated announcement of partial troopwithdrawals from Kampuchea (Cambodia), up to now there has been nosign of reduction of Vietnamese aggressor troops,'' the ForeignMinistry said. ``One may suspect whether the same old trick isbeing played once again.''   Vietnam says it has made annual troop withdrawals since 1982,but the United States says the only genuine one was made lastNovember when 20,000 troops left Cambodia.   American officials say the other troop movements were onlyrotations.   The United States estimates there are still 120,000 to 125,000Vietnamese troops in Cambodia.   Hanoi said it will pull out 50,000 soldiers from June toDecember and put its remaining troops under the command of theVietnamese-installed government in Cambodia as part of its plan topull out completely by 1990.   However, China said, ``it is entirely deceptive talk for theVietnamese side to state that it will further withdraw'' its troops.   China was a supporter of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge regime thatVietnam ousted in 1978, and has since been the most vociferousopponent of Vietnam's presence in Cambodia.   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 until the Vietnameseinvasion. During that time it killed millions of Cambodians as itpursued its policy of radical agrarian communism.   China now supports a three-party resistance coalition headed byPrince Norodom Sihanouk, who was ousted as ruler of Cambodia in a1970 military coup.   The coalition, made up of three guerilla groups including theKhmer Rouge, is recognized by the United Nations as the legitimategovernment of Cambodia and receives arms and financial support fromChina.   China reiterated today that the only way to resolve theCambodian question is for Vietnam to completely withdraw its troopsand take part in negotiations to establish an independent Cambodiangovernment.   Vietnam has said it is an outsider and has no place innegotiations on Cambodia.   ``It will lead nowhere for Vietnam to disguise itself as anoutsider,'' China's statement said.   China has made Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia a condition innormalizing relations with the Soviet Union. It claims Vietnamwould not be able to maintain its occupation without the Kremlim'ssupport.   China and the Soviet Union split over ideological and strategicdifferences in the 1960s, but relations have improved in recentyears.</TEXT></DOC>
