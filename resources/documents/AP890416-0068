Police Sgt. Glenn Repp III repeatedly ordered Dallas Sgt. LarryWise to ``Drop it, Larry'' before both men opened fire at a rangeof about 20 feet, said Duncanville police spokesman Dan Robertson.   Wise, hit once in the chest, died about 50 minutes later at 4:05a.m. at Charlton Methodist Hospital, Robertson said.   Repp and his partner, Officer Stacy Holden, were not wounded.   Wise, a 20-year police veteran, lived at the house with hiswife, Cindy, police said. The couple, who had once been separated,had gotten into an argument at a nightclub earlier in the eveningwhile celebrating Mrs. Wise's birthday.   Wise's sister-in-law, Brenda Smith, told police he made threats,Robertson said.   Ms. Smith, fearing for the safety of Wise's 13-year-old son anda teen-age friend, went to pick up the youngsters, and asked policeto accompany her.   Repp and Holden arrived at Wise's home just before he did,Robertson said. Wise spotted the officers and pointed his gun atthem, then lowered it and headed for the door.   The officers, who sought cover behind their car when Wise raisedhis weapon, were approaching him when the shooting broke out.   Robertson said police weren't sure who fired the first shot, butDallas police spokesman Hollis Edwards said Duncanville police toldhim Wise fired first and Repp returned fire in self-defense.   Ms. Smith and a male friend pulled up in time to see theshooting, Robertson said.   Mrs. Wise arrived afterwards, and took the teen-agers to aneighbor's home, friends said.   Carl Chapman, who lives across the street from the Wise home,said Wise ``was a nice guy.'' Other neighbors, who asked not to beidentified, said they had never seen trouble between the couple.   Repp, who knew Wise professionally, was put on a one-week leave.   Robertson said the Duncanville and Dallas departments worktogether daily, and said he hoped the shooting wouldn't change therelationship between the two forces.   ``We hope the (Dallas) officers can see our officers only didwhat they had to do,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
