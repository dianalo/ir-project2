The agreement, also signed by the aircraft engine unit ofDaimler-Benz AG of West Germany, follows the establishment ofseveral new business relationships between Western and Sovietaerospace concerns recently. These new links are driven inlarge part by Soviet demand for Western technology and aneagerness in the West to gain access to the huge Sovietaviation market that is opening up as East-West relationsdefrost.</LP><TEXT>   Despite the West's shifting political posture towardMoscow, the new links between the Western and Sovietaerospace concerns face questions about possible technologytransfers of potential military significance. &quot;This is all sonew to everyone, we're writing this book as we go along,&quot;said a Pratt andamp; Whitney spokesman in East Hartford, Conn.   He said Pratt andamp; Whitney's agreement with the SovietMinistry of Aviation Industry and Daimler-Benz's Motoren-undTurbinen-Union, known as MTU, is aimed at the eventualdevelopment and co-production of jet engines for two newSoviet passenger planes. The aircraft are the Ilyushin Il-96,a long-range, four-engine airliner with about 270 seats, andthe Tupolev Tu-204, a twin-engine plane with about 170 seats,the spokesman said. The accord formalizes and advancesearlier discussions about supplying Pratt andamp; Whitney enginesfor these planes, he said.   Under the cooperation agreement, Pratt andamp; Whitney willconsider joint ventures with the Soviets on all but thebiggest commercial jet engines, those producing 50,000 ormore pounds of thrust to power wide-body planes, thespokesman said. In addition to jet-power plants, the Sovietswant to talk about co-production of turboprop engines, hesaid.   The cooperation pact is Pratt andamp; Whitney's latest move inits hunt for Soviet business. Earlier this year, when theSoviet airline Aeroflot announced its first purchase ofWestern aircraft from Airbus Industrie, a European aircraftconsortium based in France, Pratt andamp; Whitney pressed its caseto the Soviets for fitting the wide-body planes with enginesfrom East Hartford. But in March, Aeroflot said it would buythe engines from Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric Co.instead.   &quot;They have a very large potential (engine) market,&quot; thePratt andamp; Whitney spokesman said of the Soviet Union. Thecooperation pact &quot;opens the door for us for furtherdiscussions,&quot; he said. He added that the agreement &quot;is more amarket-driven decision than a technology-driven decision, onour part, in any case.&quot;   Besides the Aeroflot purchase of Airbus planes and GEengines, the recently launched Soviet-Western aerospaceindustry relationships include an agreement betweenLondon-based Rolls-Royce PLC, a maker of aircraft engines,and the Sukhoi and Syulka design bureaus to develop an enginefor a supersonic executive jet that is under jointdevelopment by Sukhoi and Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. ofSavannah, Ga.
