RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to referee animportant railroad industry dispute affecting the ability ofrailroads to sell off their lines and reduce their work forces.   The court said it will use appeals involving the small Pittsburghandamp; Lake Erie Railroad Co. in Pennsylvania and Ohio to resolve issuestroubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide.   At issue, in part, is the authority of the Interstate CommerceCommission to exempt railroads from collective bargaining when theysell rail lines. A key related question involves the authority offederal courts to block strikes in such cases.   The Reagan administration supported the ICC's plea that the courtsettle the issues, which have generated disagreement among lowercourts.   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that thePittsburgh andamp; Lake Erie Railroad (Pandamp;LE) may not sell its 182 miles ofrail line in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohion without engagingin collective bargaining.   The appeals court said the federal Railway Labor Act requires therailorad to bargain with the unions over the effects the proposedsale would have in eliminating jobs.   The appeals court also ruled that the federal courts lackauthority to block a strike by the workers.   The appeals court said a federal law known as theNorris-LaGuardia Act deprives federal judges of the power to barstrikes in such circumstances. The appeals court rejected therailroad's arguments that the act may be set aside in cases wherethe ICC has approved proposed rail line sales.   There is ``no inherent incompatibility'' between recentcongressional efforts to deregulate the railroad industry and theaim of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to protect railway workers, theappeals court said.   ``Implicit in the congressional vision of a vigorous free marketis the realization that all major participants in the economy mustbe left free to exercise their economic strength,'' the appealscourt said.   The financially troubled Pandamp;LE announced in July 1987 it wouldsell its rail lines to a newly formed company that planned tooperate the lines with fewer workers.   The ICC approved the plan without requiring the railroad toengage in collective bargaining with its unions, which then called astrike in September 1987.   Pandamp;LE currently is seeking a new purchaser for the lines otherthan the newly formed company, called Railco.   After Congress approved a 1980 deregulation law, the ICC has beenencouraging railroads to sell rather than abandon less profitableregional lines.   The commission adopted a process to streamline sales by relievingrailroads of any obligation to bargain with employees.   In a related action, the high court rejected an appeal by laborunions challenging the sale of 208 miles of track between Green Bayand Milwaukee, Wis., by Chicago andamp; North Western Transporation Co.   The court left intact a ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals blocking a strike by the unions over the loss of some 200jobs.   The three cases are Pittsburgh andamp; Lake Erie Railroad Co. vs.Railway Labor Executives, 87-1589, Pandamp;LE Railroad vs. RLE, 87-1888and RLE vs. Candamp;NW, 88-464.</TEXT></DOC>
