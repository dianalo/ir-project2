KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican members of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee made clear today that it will be difficult, ifnot impossible, to build bipartisan support for legislationimposing new and stern economic sanctions against white-dominatedSouth Africa.   And State Department officials suggested that any action on themeasure to institute an almost-total trade embargo on South Africaand to pull out most U.S. investment might disrupt delicate ongoingnegotiations involving independence for Namibia and the withdrawalof cuban troops from Angola.   The committee set a vote for Wednesday on the measure asstatements from individual Republican members indicated thelegislation will not enjoy the wide bipartisan support given themilder sanctions bill that became law over President Reagan's vetotwo years ago.   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a key supporter of sanctionslegislation in 1986, called the present bill ``untimely'' and toldthe committee, ``There are occasions when legislation is not alwayshelpful.''   ``At this moment, to go into a total disruption of our businessin South Africa does not benefit anyone,'' Lugar said, adding thatthe measure would remove any leverage the United States has tobring pressure on South Africa to end its apartheid system offorced racial separation.   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., agreed, saying she does notbelieve that comprehensive sanctions will end apartheid.   ``We simply create havoc,'' she said. ``To strike out alone witha package that requires complete disinvestment and a total tradeembargo does not behoove us at this time.''   Speaking for the bill, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said it isdesigned to ``increase the costs of maintaining apartheid.''   ``If we fail to focus on South Africa we will, in essence, allowthe South African regime to declare victory ...,'' Cranston said.``We have a moral obligation to continue to press for freedom forall South Africans.''   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., is reportedly ready to submit up to 40amendments designed to dilute the impact of the legislation duringits examination by the Foreign Relations panel.   President Reagan is considered highly likely to veto newsanctions legislation if the Senate follows the lead of the Houseand approves a bill blocking most trade with South Africa andrequiring practically a complete withdrawal of U.S. businessinvestment.   Cranston and Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., another backer of theharsh sanctions measure, said on Wednesday they believed themeasure could be brought to the Senate floor for a vote in thewaning days of this year's session, despite a tight legislativeschedule.   But both said it would be difficult to pass the bill in theabsence of significant Republican support. They said opponentscould make it difficult even to get it past the Foreign RelationsCommittee.   Even if both of those hurdles were cleared, there would not beenough support to override a veto, they said.   But any action, even passage by the committee, would ``send asignal to the government of South Africa that pressure is rising''against apartheid, Simon said.   ``I know of no other way to send that signal, other thansanctions,'' he said.   Simon said his recent five-day trip to South Africa convincedhim that it is time for the United States to adopt the mostpunishing economic sanctions to date as a signal to Pretoria thatits apartheid policies of racial repression must be abandoned.   ``Blacks are living in despair and hopelessness, and whites areliving in fear,'' Simon told a news conference. ``And the greaterthe fear, the more there is repression.''   ``South Africa is drifting toward massive violence and thecommunity of nations has to signal to South Africa that peacefulchange has got to come about,'' he said.   The House bill, passed on Aug. 11 by a vote of 244-132, hasbecome a focal point of election-year politics. Many Democratswould like to force the issue in order to portray Republicans whooppose it as weak on civil and human rights.   Opponents contend stronger sanctions would impose furthereconomic hardship on black South Africans and strengthen thegovernment's resolve to resist pressure for change from outside.   A more limited sanctions measure was enacted two years ago overReagan's veto, an action made possible only with significant GOPsupport in both chambers.</TEXT></DOC>
