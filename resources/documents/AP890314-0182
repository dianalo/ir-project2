Federal officials immediately claimed the verdict as the firstaffirmation of a 1984 statute asserting for the United States``long-arm'' jurisdiction over the taking of American hostagesaboard.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh hailed the verdict as ``a boostfor our efforts to effectively deal with international terrorism.''   ``Those who violate the rights of U.S. citizens are hereby put onnotice that the American law enforcement system is capable ofexacting a penalty for these terroristic crimes, regardless of wherethey occur,'' Thornburgh said in a statement.   The Lebanese Younis, bearded and with black hair, showed noemotion as a female interpreter relayed the verdict the jury reachedafter three days of deliberations: Guilty on three counts, innocenton three others.   While the jury of seven women and five men filed out of thecourtroom, Younis chatted with the Arabic interpretor, and appearedrelaxed and smiling.   For his conviction on the most serious offense, taking hostages,the 30-year-old Younis could be sentenced to life in prison.   ``This case demonstrates the determination of the United Statesgovernment to bring to justice in the United States internationalterrorists who victimize U.S. citizens wherever violence andhostage-taking acts are committed,'' U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephenssaid in a statement.   Younis' court-appointed attorney, Francis D. Carter, contestedthe government claim and said he would appeal the conviction ongrounds that the United States ought not to have jurisdiction overthe 1985 hijacking. He said he also would appeal on grounds themilitary was involved in the arrest.   ``It is an outrage,'' said Carter. The case ``was not about theUnited States'' and the two Americans aboard the aircraft were notharmed.   Younis was lured aboard a yacht in international waters in theMediterranean Sea on Sept. 13, 1987, with the prospect of a drugdeal and a party.   He was slammed to the deck by members of the FBI hostage rescuesquad and interrogated for four days aboard a Navy munitions ship.Then, after he gave a detailed confession, he was flown non-stopfrom the deck of an aircraft carrier to Washington.   Doctors later found he had suffered hairline fractures of bothwrists during the arrest. But during his interrogation, the swellingwas treated only with bags of ice.   ``Mr. Younis did not expect an awful lot from the United Statesafter the means used to arrest him,'' Carter said.   ``I tried to prepare him and told him that an American jury wasprobably not likely for an acquittal in this case,'' Carter said.``He was not too hopeful.''   ``He was happy that on three counts, he was found not guilty, andthose three counts were the horribles,'' harming or threateningpassengers, destroying an aircraft, and carrying weapons aboard anaircraft, said Carter.   Younis was convicted on these counts:   _Seizing hostages, with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.   _Conspiracy to commit sky piracy, with a maximum sentence of fiveyears.   _Hijacking a commercial airliner, with a maximum 20 years inprison.   He was found innocent on these counts:   _Using or threatening violence against passengers or crew membersof a commercial airliner.   _Destroying a civilian aircraft.   _Carrying aboard a civilian aircraft devices likely to damage it.   Carter had argued that Younis should be acquitted because hehijacked the aircraft under orders from Lebanon's Amal militia, aShiite Moslem group to which he had belonged since 1979.   Younis testified that he knew hijacking a civilian airliner wasillegal, but said Amal was at war.   But he acknowledged under cross-examination that Amal was not atwar with any of the passengers or crew, with Royal JordanianAirlines or the government of Jordan.   Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr., instructed the jury that``Hijacking a plane is illegal. ... Obeying illegal orders ... isnot a defense.''   To find the defendant innocent on grounds that he was obeyingorders, said Robinson, the jury would have to conclude he did notknow hijacking was illegal.   A federal appeals court has already ruled the arrest of Younis,while not a model of law enforcement, was acceptable and that theconfession could be used in court against him.   Carter said he expected the the judge to issue a sentence in 30to 45 days, and said that he would be reviewing the record of thetrial to determine whether there were further gounds for appeal.   A federal appeals court has already ruled that the arrest, whilenot a model of law enforcement, was acceptable and that a writtenconfession signed by Younis could be used against him, closing thatavenue of appeal.   During the trial, five eyewitnesses identified Younis as theleader of the hijacking. Prosecutors played a videotape of him atthe end of the incident, announcing that the hijackers planned todestroy the aircraft.</TEXT></DOC>
