The changein {beta}/sub eff/ due to the change in the residence time outside ofthe core of the fuel salt and to the change in the flow velocity whenthe total amount of the fuel salt is kept constant were investigated.It was found that {beta}/sub eff/ was reduced to 47.9% of the value whenthe fuel salt is at rest for the present design.</TEXT></DOC>
