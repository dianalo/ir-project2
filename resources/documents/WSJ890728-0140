The GATT trading system has achieved unprecedented trade expansion and world prosperity. What accounts then for Congress's hostility? The explanation lies in a host of fallacies.    Fallacy 1. Multilateralism does not work: At best, the pace is too slow.    This is simply not true. Under GATT auspices, tariff barriers among the industrialized countries -- including Japan -- were successively lowered to negligible levels. It took more than two decades and seven negotiating rounds, but it worked.    Many Americans believe that the failure to get an eighth round started in 1982 proved multilateralism's failure. But only four years later, the desired round began. The subject matter is complex and tricky this time, covering difficult new sectors (agriculture and services) and issues (intellectual property) that cannot be rushed if wise solutions are to be negotiated.    Fallacy 2. Unilateral threats of trade retaliation are necessary to prevent &quot;unfair traders&quot; from exploiting America's more open economy. GATT would, at best, produce exchange of trade concessions whereas the U.S. is entitled to get something for nothing.    This is no more than self-serving rhetoric. The U.S. has more than its share of trade-restraining arrangements -- &quot;voluntary&quot; restraints on steel, textiles etc. -- and the East Asian economies are often forced, as with automobiles, to exercise export restraint in the face of a hostile Congress even when there are no formal arrangements. The European Community has even released lists of American unfair trade practices, paying us back in our own coin.    Fallacy 3. The U.S. trade deficit is unsustainable and requires immediate correction. Tough tactics must be used to open Japan fast.    The American trade deficit reflects America's own macroeconomic folly. If the U.S. does not bring its excess spending down by reducing the budget deficit, the removal of foreign trade barriers will not make any sustained difference to the trade deficit. Remember: The U.S. trade deficit became large in the mid-'80s -- when Japan's trade barriers fell.    Fallacy 4. Japan is different from the U.S. Its market is inherently harder to penetrate. Therefore we must scrap the &quot;unrealistic&quot; GATT system and shift to some form of managed trade.    There is nothing more silly than the assertion that trade imbalances necessarily follow because trading countries are different culturally or economically. Imbalances reflect macroeconomic factors. If this is hard to grasp, just ask yourself: Why did Japan's &quot;inevitable&quot; surplus wait so long to emerge when Japanese cultural impenetrability had been with us ever since Commodore Perry?    Fallacy 5. Free trade can work only between culturally homogeneous nations.    In fact, the opposite is true: If we were all identical, there would be no profit from trade. Equally, we must dismiss the notion that Japan's cultural difference makes mutual trade, driven by prices, impossible. In the past two years, Japanese imports of manufactured goods increased by 33% annually, mostly because of the rise in the value of the yen. The Japanese do belong to the human race that Adam Smith wrote about.    Fallacy 6. GATT is dead because there are so many violations of its rules.    Some important GATT rules have indeed been sidetracked. Thus countries seeking relief from unmanageable imports can, under Article XIX of GATT, protect their economies from foreign competition so long as they treat all exporters equally. Instead, industrialized countries, the U.S. among them, have simply forced selected exporting countries to restrain export &quot;voluntarily.    When the rule of law is breached, you do not turn automatically to the law of the jungle; instead you try to see where things went wrong and to improve law-enforcement. The current Uruguay Round is accordingly concentrating on issues, like rejuvenating Article XIX, that will strengthen GATT.    Fallacy 7. GATT is dead because the world is shifting to regional blocs and rejecting multilateralism.    This thesis is partly true and mostly false. The U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and Europe 1992 are at center stage for now. But so is the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations. Besides, both 1992 and the Free Trade Agreement reflect a coincidence of events from which it is impossible to infer either a trend or a rejection of multilateralism. 1992 merely intensifies an ongoing phenomenon, making the Common Market commoner. Its impulse was internal unification, political and economic. The Free Trade Agreement, equally unprotectionist in intent, reflects altogether different forces. The U.S. wanted to take the political momentum away from protectionists in Congress. Canada wanted to escape from the consequences of America's &quot;unfair trade&quot; mania.    Fallacy 8: GATT is dead because increasing trade conflicts will force bureaucrats and politicians to settle them bilaterally.    True, countries have turned to crying foul against their trading rivals. Dumping and foreign subsidization are often charged; failure to sell is translated into conspiratorial refusal to buy. Presently bilateral skirmishes follow because a mutually acceptable evaluation of the allegation is rare. Rather, when made by Americans, the allegations go before American commissions and agencies, and are decided by Americans. More than ever, an impartial dispute settlement mechanism is needed. GATT has experienced but little clout in playing this role. The need to enhance its authority to do so is now widely accepted.    GATT has to be built afresh, filling in the gaps that have arisen as the world economy has evolved. Services and agriculture have to be brought within its ambit. Market disruption and dispute settlement mechanisms have to be overhauled. There is simply no alternative to making the effort needed to establish GATT firmly at the center of the world's trading system in this way.    ---   Mr. Bhagwati, an economics professor at Columbia, is the author of &quot;Protectionism&quot; (MIT, 1988). </TEXT></DOC>
