Schlender (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> EDP </IN><DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A computer &quot;virus&quot; infiltrated an international computer network late Wednesday, shutting down hundreds of technical workstations and several supercomputers yesterday in the U.S., Europe and Australia.    The virus, a program concocted by a computer saboteur, was transmitted from computer to computer through electronic mail services provided by Arpanet, a network managed by a research arm of the U.S. Defense Department that is used by universities and research institutions to tap into each other's idle computer power and to share data.    The bug attacked machines that use the Unix operating system, filling their disk storage devices to capacity with unwanted data files until the computers shut down from data congestion.    &quot;This is the first major virus to enter computers through networks,&quot; said Dennis Maxwell, vice president, corporate marketing, at SRI International Inc., a California think-tank hit by the virus that discovered and distributed an &quot;antidote&quot; program to victims.    It isn't known who planted the virus or where it was inserted into the Arpanet network. While most affected computers had been cured late yesterday, the virus still lies dormant in the electronic mailboxes of hundreds of other computers. Those systems will have to be innoculated by one of the antidote programs to keep them from being shut down as well.    Computer security consultants said the virus itself wasn't that damaging. However, they said, it demonstrated that with the proper expertise, even the most sophisticated and secure computer networks can be sabotaged.    The virus first appeared in California late Wednesday night at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in Berkeley and in Livermore, and quickly spread through Arpanet to Stanford University in Palo Alto, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Laboratories in Mountain View and the University of California at Berkeley.    Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge reported that the virus entered its computers in the early morning hours yesterday, and exited several hours later as mysteriously as it entered. MIT said its systems weren't crippled, but that several of its computers were slowed down as the virus spread, using up memory. MIT said the virus also infected computers at Harvard University, Princeton University, Columbia University, Rutgers University and the University of Rochester.    There were other reports that computers at several European financial institutions were infected, as were research laboratories in Australia.    &quot;This has to be the grandaddy of all computer viruses so far,&quot; said Robert Campbell, president of Advanced Information Management Inc. in Woodbridge, Va., a firm that helps large companies manage computer systems. Mr. Campbell said the virus was noteworthy because of its speed in infecting hundreds of sites and because it could crack secret passwords to get access to restricted computers.    Computer specialists at affected institutions said the virus wasn't as damaging as it could have been, because it wasn't designed to destroy files. By clogging up computers' data-storage devices, the virus only slowed down some machines and caused others to shut down.    Such viruses have become an increasing problem as more and more computers are linked into networks. The networks make it possible for nefarious hackers to propagate programs from computer to computer.    Some viruses create harmless, often humorous messages to appear on the screens of infected machines. But others destroy valuable data or cripple important programs, shutting down vital systems and requiring days of repairs.    ---   Gary Putka in Boston contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
