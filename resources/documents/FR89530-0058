The intended researchwill (1) perform core floods in the presence of oil, (2) measure the kineticsof precipitation of the anionic/cationic surfactants used, (3) incorporatethese results into the reservoir simulator model to further define theviability of the process in reservoirs of varying characteristics, and(4) transfer the learned technologies to the oil operators through publicationsand workshops. In accordance with 10 CFR 600.14 (D) and (E), the University of Oklahomahas been selected as the grant recipient. This activity would be conductedby the University of Oklahoma based on the meritorious application of thegeneral evaluation. DOE support of the activity would enhance the publicbenefits to be derived by allowing further coverage of the state's reservoirs.This activity represents a unique and innovative idea and method whichwould not be eligible for financial assistance under solicitation, or if,as determined by DOE, a competitive solicitation would be inappropriate.The term of the grant is for a six month period at an estimated value of$24,850.00. The cost to DOE is anticipated at $24,850.00. There will beno cost sharing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For further information contact: </T2>U.S. Department of Energy, PittsburghEnergy Technology Center, Acquisition and Assistance Division, P.O.
