What is theproductivity payoff?andP;  How much of an investment is involved?andP;  What productspromise the best performance and the best guarantees of future compatibility?andO;And which of the vendors that have leaped on the crowded SQL bandwagon aregoing to emerge as the winners?andM;THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACHandM;Traditionally, corporate databases have been stored on central file serversconnected to individual PCs over a local area network (LAN).andP;  Under thisarrangement, the file server must download the entire database programwhenever a network PC requests even a small amount of data.andP;  On a busynetwork, the result is often a bottleneck or even a crash.andM;Under client-server architecture, however, database functions are split intwo.andP;  The &quot;back end,&quot; or &quot;engine,&quot; is the file server itself, which housesthe database.andP;  Unlike a storage-only file server, a database server has ahefty amount of processing power of its own, which it uses to store, search,sort, retrieve, and manage data.andP;  When users query the server through the&quot;front end,&quot; instead of downloading the entire database, the server sendsback only the requested data.andM;The front end, also known as the &quot;client&quot; or &quot;requestor,&quot; is the PC software,which might be a spreadsheet or a word-processing program.andP;  Most majorsoftware companies, including Lotus Development Corp., are working on newversions of their applications that will be able to query an SQL database andpull the data directly into the application.andM;A front-end program translates a query into SQL before routing it to the backend.andP;  Although most front ends are still in development, their manufacturersare promising software with interfaces consisting of familiar menus andprompts.andP;  (For Lotus's front-end plans, see &quot;The Lotus Strategy: Connect1-2-3 to SQL Databases&quot; on page 60.)andM;You can think of SQL as the glue that holds the front ends and back endstogether (see &quot;A Short History of SQL&quot; on page 62).andP;  It is a languagespecifically designed for working with relational databases, those databasesthat let you access more than one file at a time.andP;  SQL solutions have beenaround in the mini and mainframe worlds for years, but they required users toprogram with arcane and difficult-to-master SQL commands.andP;  What's new andexciting is the upcoming marriage of SQL programming power to the ease of useto which PC users are accustomed.andM;The division of labor in the client-server approach means that more than oneuser at a time can read and write to the same database with no deteriorationin performance.andP;   For example, SQL Server, the Ashton-Tate/Microsoft product,running on an 80386-based computer with at least 8 megabytes of RAM and a300-megabyte database will manage the queries of more than 35 users, with aresponse time of less than a second.andM;In addition to faster, more accurate database searches, client-serverarchitecture offers better security and data integrity.andP;  For example, if thesystem fails, there is a much better chance of recovering data, since alldata resides on the server and &quot;speaks&quot; the lingua franca of SQL.andP;  And thesoftware gives much greater control over who has clearance to access whatdata.andM;THE CROWDED SQL BANDWAGONandM;As corporations start to think about replacing their traditional databasesystems, there is a mad scramble by software companies to come out withback-end SQL server engines and front-end applications.andP;  The list of softwaredevelopers churning out SQL products reads like a Who's Who ofmicrocomputing: Microsoft Corp., IBM, Borland International, LotusDevelopment Corp., Oracle Corp., Novell, Ashton-Tate, and Microrim, to name afew.andP;  Their motivation is clear.andP;  Edward M. Esber Jr., chairman and CEO ofAshton-Tate, has been quoted as saying that &quot;whoever owns the database serverowns office automation for the next decade.&quot;andM;In the grab for market share, some companies seem to be competing withthemselves by creating front-end software for a competitor's server, or viceversa.andP;  Most have spent the past two years assaying each other like medievalwarlords, forging an array of unlikely, shifting, and contradictory alliancesi the hope of advancing their kingdoms.andM;In addition to the question of what kinds of products will emerge from thesesoftware developer alliances, there is the fundamental question: Who needsthis client-server architecture?andP;  Data-intensive businesses like banks andvery competitive businesses, such as giant retailers and mail-order houses,are natural customers.andP;  These big corporations have for years used PCs forstand-alone applications, but have stored their major databases on minis andmainframes.andP;  This group is beginning to view the client-server approach asthe solution to the problem of getting micros and mainframes to talk to eachother.andM;Right now, there are more people shopping than there are people buying.andP;  Butanalysts predict that once the technology is proven reliable, all that willchange, and sales will surge.andP;  Within three years, they say, client-server architecture will be widespread in Fortune 500 companies.andM;Smaller businesses may have a harder time justifying the upgrade.andP;  Theseengines offer a tremendous &quot;power advantage,&quot; which will become more apparentas the front ends become available, says New York consultant WilliamClaiborne, who specializes in small database-management systems.andP;  &quot;But youhave to ask yourself how often you need six people accessing information atthe same time.&quot;andM;Investing in client-server architecture isn't cheap.andP;  First there's the costof the back-end engine.andP;  Oracle's back end, for example, will cost $2,499 forOS/2 and more for the Unix operating system.andP;  SQL Server costs $2,495 forOS/2.andP;  In addition to the back end, you'll have the expense of local andwide-area networks, memory-rich, 80386-based file servers, front-endapplications, and employee training.andM;Several companies are offering lighter-weight back-end SQL engines that rununder DOS, but few software vendors are supporting these with front-endapplication products.andP;  The best-supported DOS back end may be Novell'sNetWareSQL, which incorporates most of its Btrieve file-management system.andO;NetWareSQL costs only $595 and will have front ends from Lotus, Borland,Nantucket Corp., Fox Software, and several other software companies.andP;  But theNovell server isn't as capable as, for example, Oracle's server for OS/2.andO;&quot;[Oracle's product] provides connectivity that we can't provide at thistime,&quot; admits Novell spokesman Dwight Davis.andP;  &quot;The people we'd like to targetright now are the ones who don't need all of Oracle's connectivity or can'tafford it.&quot;andM;HEAT FROM THE FRONT LINEandM;Because the technology is new and complex, every vendor's SQL product--orpromise of products--has come under fire from some quarter.andP;  For example,according to analyst/programmer Thomas Reardon, of Duke University MedicalCenter in North Carolina: &quot;What's available is not much, and what's coming istoo much to be true.&quot;andM;One early SQL adopter, Ken Shapiro, vice president of Citibank in New York,chose Gupta Technologies' SQLBase back end.andP;  In the middle of 1988, whenShapiro was looking, it was the only viable player in the field.andP;  &quot;Wecouldn't wait around for Presentation Manager and all the servers supportingit,&quot; says Shapiro.andP;  &quot;Business goes on.&quot;andM;Today, the field is larger.andP;  At least a dozen companies--including smallfirms like XDB Systems and Via Information Systems Corp. and better-knowncompanies such as Microrim--have released or announced server products.andP;  Butmost analysts agree that they may be either too little or too late topenetrate corporate America in a big way.andP;  Three major contenders haveemerged for that market: IBM, Oracle, and the Ashton-Tate/Microsoft alliance.andM;Part of the reason is sheer size.andP;  &quot;The single most decisive factor will bedistribution channels,&quot; predicts analyst Michael Braude, vice president ofthe Gartner Group, a market research firm in Stamford, Conn.andP;  &quot;That why Guptais a long shot.&quot;andM;In recent months, the server wars have taken an especially hawkish turn.andO;Gupta Technologies took out full-page ads proclaiming, &quot;We invented the SQLdatabase server.&quot;andP;  At Oracle's official introdution of its server product,president Lawrence J. Ellison trashed IBM and called theAshton-Tate/Microsoft server &quot;Stalinist&quot; because it supports only oneoperating system and a limited number of hardware platforms.andP;  Novell says itsfront end and back end offer the tightest possible integration when usedtogether.andP;  Ashton-Tate says the same for dBase.andM;The question of which one of the three major servers a company chooses mayprove to be partly a function of the products the company already hasinstalled.andP;  &quot;If you have Oracle databases on other platforms, you're going tobe looking at Oracle,&quot; says Bill Higgs, vice president of software researchat Infocorp (Santa Clara, Calif.).andP;  &quot;If you're a True Blue shop, you'reprobably going to go with IBM.&quot;andM;Steve Davies, a programmer with Patterson Dental Co., a large dental-supplyfirm in Minneapolis, is working with a vice president of his company todecide on a server.andP;  The vice president &quot;has a mainframe background and isvery IBM-oriented,&quot; says Davies.andP;  So while Davies prefers SQL Server, hesuspects he'll be overruled.andM;The IBM database server, still unreleased, is a multiuser version of its OS/2Extended Edition Database Manager.andP;  Few analysts recommend it for any reasonother than single-supplier convenience.andP;  Oracle's database server isscheduled to be released in October and promises to work with a vast array ofnetworks, operating systems, and hardware platforms including the AppleMacintosh.andM;But some observers wonder whether Oracle can deliver on its promises.andP;  &quot;Evenif Oracle really were supporting the 50 platforms it says it is, what kind ofoptimization could it deliver to each?&quot; asks analyst Richard Finkelstein,president of Performance Computing, a consulting firm that specializes inrelational database management systems.andP;  &quot;IBM, with all its resources, issupporting only four.&quot;andM;Oracle's marketing is aggressive, however, and versions of itsdatabase-management program are well entrenched in corporate America.andP;  &quot;Theysure seem to own the mini world,&quot; says Mark Whiteside, vice president ofsales and marketing for Nantucket Corp., makers of Clipper, adatabase-development program.andP;  &quot;I keep getting calls from corporate clientswho say, 'We're a Clipper shop on the PC, and Oracle is pushing us to committo a total Oracle solution.'&quot;  If the pressure continues, Whiteside admits,Nantucket--which now supports the Ashton-Tate/Microsoft, IBM, Gupta, andNovell servers--will have to support Oracle as well.andM;THERE ARE STANDARDS AND STANDARDSandM;Except for its competition, virtually everyone in the industry gives thetechnical edge to SQL Server.andP;  Unlike Oracle, which conforms to the SQLstandard defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), SQLServer incorporates &quot;extensions&quot; of the language, such as stored procedures.andO;These are macrolike compiled programs that define commonly used transactionsand that execute in a fraction of the time it takes to input ordinarycommands.andP;  But probably the flashiest features are &quot;triggers,&quot; a type ofstored procedure.andP;  A trigger, activated on the command to insert, delete, orupdate, instantly fires off watchdog programs to make sure that the operationdoesn't violate the rules of the database.andM;Edward Oates, Oracle's vice president of desktop products, says that Oracleis developing its own stored procedures and will include them in the nextversion of Oracle.andP;  Triggers remain outside the ANSI standard, however, andOates warns that those who invest in the SQL Server procedures might be leftout in the cold in the future, should ANSi--or a company like IBM--define adifferent standard.andM;&quot;[Oracle's] database technology is basically left over from the '70s,&quot;responds Ashton-Tate's Pamela Goldschmidt.andP;  &quot;And now they have to come upwith a marketing reason to explain why SQL Server has fancy features theydon't have.&quot;andM;While the back-end server battle heats up, the front-end action is justbeginning.andP;  Aside from the question of which back end to support, front-endvendors are realizing that their products will have to change fundamentallyas a result of client-server architecture.andP;  Programs can be smaller, but theyface new technical challenges, such as accessing data stored across multipleservers.andM;They will also have to be friendlier, and some vendors welcome what the saywill be a new freedom to be creative.andP;  Clipper developers, notes Nantucket'sWhiteside, like building user products.andP;  &quot;Designing the data structures andall that stuff is grunt work,&quot; he says, &quot;and that's the stuff that's nowgoing to be taken care of on the server side.andP;  Designing the interface is thesexy part.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
