Haiti will also hold local and legislative elections, thegovernment of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril said in a communique readSunday over state radio.   ``All dispositions have been taken to guarantee security andensure a peaceful transition of power,'' the communique said.   On Jan. 17, 1988, civilian Leslie Manigat was elected inballoting thought to have been rigged by the army. Manigat wasousted in a military coup five months later.   The presidential elections will be held in two rounds on Oct. 17and Nov. 11, 1990, the government said.   The first round will be among a field of about 10 candidates,and the second will be a runoff among the top vote-getters, thecommunique said.   It did not say how many candidates would be allowed into thesecond round, nor did it say whether international observers wouldbe allowed to monitor the balloting.   On Nov. 29, 1987, Haiti tried to hold the first free generalelections since the country gained independence from France in1804, but 34 voters were shot and hacked to death at the polls bythugs in collusion with the army.   The balloting was canceled.   The U.S. government has said Haiti must transfer power to acivilian government before Washington will fully restore the $60million in foreign aid suspended after the 1987 election massacre.   Avril has said repeatedly that he heads a transition governmentand will relinquish power. Under Haiti's constitution, no member ofthe military can run for president within a year of resigning andif he plans to seek office Avril must resign before Oct. 17.   Avril became president on Sept. 17, 1988 in a coup against Lt.Gen. Henri Namphy by noncommissioned officers who demanded an endto state-sponsored violence. He was formerly associated with the30-year Duvalier dictatorship,   The government announced the election after receiving therecommendations of an independent electoral council on Saturday.The nine-member council was set up in April to organize and overseethe balloting.   The communique said the electoral council will set up itscentral, district, municipal, and local offices between now and theend of the year and will register voters from January to March.   There are an estimated 3 million eligible voters, and thecouncil will have to set up about 6,000 voting places.</TEXT></DOC>
