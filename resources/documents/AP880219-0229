Total spending for the 1989 fiscal year would be cut only 5percent to around $48.3 billion. And virtually all of the sensitivecrop programs, with the exception of sugar, would suffer reductionsthat already have been approved by Congress.   Sugar is a different thing entirely. The administration is deadset against the current program, claiming the supports are to highand the quotas on imports of foreign sugar too restrictive.   There are other smackeroos in the Reagan budget, to be sure. TheWhite House still wants the Rural Electrification Administration toturn most of its business over to private lenders, and the FarmersHome Administration would see its housing program dismantled.   Still, compared with some other years when Reagan has urgedcutting school lunch subsidies to rich kids and charging user feesfor meat and poultry inspection, the 1989 edition may be prettytame.   But when it comes to the old Agricultural Conservation Program,or ACP, some things don't seem to change at all. Once again Reaganhas plotted the end of one of the true survivalists of federal farmprograms.   The ACP was started in the 1930s to help farmers pay the cost ofcarrying out approved conservation practices on their land. ThroughRepublican and Democratic administrations alike, White House budgetproposals for many years have recommended cutting or ending theprogram, which has been running at around $200 million a year.   Each time, however, Congress has insisted that ACP be kept, andfunded at approximately the same level.   A year ago, in his budget for 1988, Reagan asked Congress torescind most of the ACP money and also to hold bank funds for anumber of other conservation programs, none so big as ACP but stillnotable as having their own constituencies.   The programs are operated by two USDA agencies, the AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service, and the Soil ConservationService.   As in the past, Congress didn't go along with last year's budgetproposal, so Reagan is trying again. But you have to look at morethan the bottom line in the USDA's budget book.   Soil and water conservation programs are grouped together into asingle category. For 1989, according to the Reagan proposal, theprograms would be operated at a level of about $2.76 billion, anincrease from an estimated 1988 program level of $2.74 billion.   The slight increase, however, reflects the impact of the giantConservation Reserve Program (CRP), which was included in the 1985farm law as a plan to take up to 45 million acres of marginal,highly erodible cropland from production for periods of 10 years.   About 23 million acres have been signed up, and departmentofficials are confident that further signups will produce theobjective.   In return for contracting to take land out of crops, farmers getUSDA assistance for half of the costs of converting the acreage tograss and trees. Thereafter, they get annual rental paymentsaveraging around $50 per acre a year.   According to department budget analysts, the CRP operated atabout $677 million in 1987, will grow to more than $1.86 billionthis year and to $2.16 billion in 1989. Some have argued that thegrowth of CRP, which requires farmers to treat land and water in akindly way, has made some of the old-line programs such as ACPobsolete.   Budget analysts point out, however, that serious moves wereafoot to kill ACP long before Congress passed the 1985 farm lawauthorizing long-term conservation contracts.   Other programs fated to end if Congress goes along, include theWater Bank Program, Emergency Conservation Program, ForestryIncentives Program, and the Colorado River Salinity Control Program.   However, there are a couple of survivors. The Water ResourceManagement Program operated by the Soil Conservation Service forthe development of small watersheds has been recommended at $116million in 1989. Although that is down from $187 million estimatedthis year, officials noted that Reagan in the past has wanted toeliminate the program entirely.   The same goes for Resource Conservation and Development, alsohandled by SCS. It would be continued at $25 million next yearunder the budget proposal.   Overall, the proposed reduction in SCS conservation programs andin FmHA's rural housing would mean fewer people working for thoseagencies. Full-time employees in SCS would be reduced to about12,395 next year from 14,177 in 1988. The FmHA would need 11,700employees, compared with 12,675 this year.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 21</NOTE></DOC>
