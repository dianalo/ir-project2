(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker will have fullaccess to the grounds at the prison facility where he is undergoingpsychological evaluation because he has not been convicted ofanything, a spokeswoman said today.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter suspended Bakker's fraud andconspiracy trial in its fourth day Thursday after being told byBakker's attorney that his client was found cowering in a fetalposition with his head under a couch.   Potter ordered the fallen evangelist to undergo testing at theFederal Correction Institute in Butner to see if he is mentallycompetent to stand trial.   No specific information on Bakker's condition will be released,Sharon Orr, a spokeswoman at the facility, said in a telephoneinterview.   ``About all I can tell you is he will go under extensivepsychological evaluation,'' Ms. Orr said. A typical evaluation takes30 to 45 days, but ``it has not been determined at this time howlong this particular evaluation will take,'' she said.   Meanwhile, Bakker's wife, Tammy, apparently was planning to seeher husband. A staff member at Jim and Tammy Ministries whorequested anonymity said Mrs. Bakker has left Orlando, Fla.   Ms. Orr said Bakker had not made up a visitor list and that theyhave not heard from Mrs. Bakker.   She said Bakker would be allowed to wear street clothes, althoughhe was issued an orange prison jumpsuit on his arrival.   Bakker, handcuffed and clad in the jumpsuit, was given a standingovation Thursday night by a large crowd of inmates when he was takento a mental health housing unit, the Durham Morning Herald reportedtoday.   As Bakker walked past a group of patients, one of them spoke tohim and Bakker smiled back, an unidentified source at thecorrectional institution told the newspaper.   Several doctors contacted said that although someone could fakemental illness, Bakker's symptoms are consistent with stress-inducedpsychosis.   ``Sure, you could fake it,'' said Dr. William Bakewell Jr.,acting chairman of the University of North Carolina School ofMedicine's psychiatry department. ``But you'd have to be an awfullygood actor to sustain it.''   On Thursday, with the jury out of the courtroom, Potter heard Dr.Basil Jackson, a Milwaukee psychiatrist who has been treating Bakkerfor nine months, say the PTL ministry founder was depressed andhallucinating, seeing people as frightening animals out to attackhim.   Bakker's attorney, George T. Davis, told Potter, ``If Mr. Bakkeris handled gently and carefully he may be able to proceed with thistrial.''   The defense suggested Bakker, 49, be put in a private psychiatricinstitution, but Potter ordered Bakker to the prison for up to 60days for evaluation. Marshals transported Bakker in handcuffs andleg shackles.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller argued before the judge thatJackson, was a ``hired gun.''   ``It's hard to interpret it any other way other than Mr. Davishas once again _ this time he didn't summon his client up to pray _this time he summons a psychiatrist up to say that his client can'tgo forward with the defense, and it's awfully suspect,'' Miller said.   The jury was not told Thursday about his condition or aboutBakker's commitment. Potter told jurors the trial would not resumebefore Wednesday.   There was no call for a mistrial in court Thursday, andprosecution and defense lawyers are under court order not to discussthe case outside court.   Bakker and other PTL executives are accused of diverting fortheir own use more than $4 million raised from followers. Ifconvicted on all 24 counts, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 yearsin prison and fined $5 million.   Jackson said Bakker's condition worsened between Wednesday andThursday, even after he was given Xanax, an anti-depressant sedative.   ``To put it in lay language, the man is stressed out,'' Jacksonsaid.   The Charlotte Observer quoted a former PTL employee as sayingThursday's events were a reminder of what it was like to work forBakker.   ``The unpredictability, the drama of it _ what the Americanjudicial system is experiencing is what we experienced at PTL, theroller coaster that we who have been around him and worked at PTLwere on,'' said Al Cress, who worked in Bakker's executive officesin 1984-85.   The newspaper also reported that 20 years ago, Bakker suffered anervous breakdown while working for Pat Robertson's TV ministry inPortsmouth, Va.   ``Please don't do this to me,'' a sobbing, disheveled Bakker toldU.S. marshals as they took him from his attorney's office to thecourthouse for processing of the commitment order. He curled up in afetal position in the back seat.   Tammy Bakker last year described a similar scene, saying in afund-raising letter to supporters that her husband had stayed in afetal position for hours after he was forced to leave the ministry.   Jessica Hahn, the woman whose 1980 sexual encounter with Bakkerled to Bakker's downfall, said in a 1987 Playboy interview that justafter the tryst, a fellow evangelist who had just come from Bakker'shotel room said he was ``lying in a fetal position in his room,saying he's happy.''</TEXT></DOC>
