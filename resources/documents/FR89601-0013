Background </ITAG>Section 102(c) of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Actof 1972, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1401 <T3>et seq. </T3>(``the Act''), gives the Administrator the authority todesignate sites where ocean dumping may be permitted. On October 1, 1986,the Administrator delegated the authority to designate ocean dumping sitesto the Regional Administrator of the Region in which the site is located.This site designation is being made pursuant to that authority. The EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter H, andSection;228.4)state that ocean dumping site will be designated by publication in Part228. A list of ``Approved and Final Ocean Dumping Sites'' was publishedon January 11, 1977 (42 FR 2461 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and was last extended on August 24, 1984 (49 FR 33647<T3>et seq</T3>.). That list established these sites as interim sites.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. EIS Development </ITAG>Section 102(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C.4321 <T3>et seq</T3>., (NEPA) requires that Federal agencies prepare an EnvironmentalImpact Statement (EIS) on proposals for legislation and other major Federalactions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Theobject of NEPA is to build into agency decision-making processes carefulconsideration of all environmental aspects of proposed actions. While NEPAdoes not apply to EPA activities of this type, EPA has voluntarily committedto prepare EIS's in connection with ocean dumping site designations suchas this. 39 FR 16186 (May 7, 1974). EPA has prepared a Draft and Final EIS entitled ``Environmental ImpactStatement (EIS) for Nome, Alaska, Dredged Material Disposal Site Designation''.Four reviewers submitted comments on the draft EIS, which EPA assessedand responded to in the final EIS. Comments that could not be appropriatelytreated as text changes were addressed point by point in the final EISfollowing the letters of comment. On May 25, 1984, a notice of availabilityof the Final EIS for public review and comment was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(49 FR 22123). One reviewer submitted commentsafter the close of the public comment period concerning the potential effectsof dredged material disposal on existing mineral leases and mining operations.The comment was considered in preparing this rulemaking notice. Becauseof the dynamic environment of the two proposed sites, it is unlikely thatdredged material disposal would cause a significant adverse effect. Commentswere also received after the close of the public comment period from theCorps of Engineers concerning the proposal to de-designate the WesternODMDS. Coordination continued with the Corps regarding this issue and resultedin this final rulemaking notice to designate both sites. Coordination hasincluded the City of Nome. The action discussed in the Final EIS is designation for continuing useof an ocean disposal site for dredged material. The purpose of the designationis to provide an environmentally acceptable location of ocean disposal.The appropriateness of ocean disposal is determined on a case-by-case basisas part of the process of issuing permits for ocean disposal. The EIS discussed the need for the action and examines ocean disposal sitesand alternatives to the proposed action, including land-based disposaloptions. The EIS presented the information needed to evaluate the suitability ofODMDS areas for final designation and is based on a disposal site environmentalstudy. The study and final designation process are being conducted in accordancewith the Act, the Ocean Dumping Regulations, and other applicable Federalenvironmental legislation. This final rulemaking notice fills the same role as the Record of Decisionrequired under regulations promulgated by the Council on EnvironmentalQuality for agencies subject to NEPA. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Site Designation </ITAG>On September 23, 1988, EPA proposed designation of these sites for thecontinuing disposal of dredged materials from Nome harbor. The public commentperiod on this proposed action closed November 7, 1988. One letter of commentwas received from the U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals ManagementService (MMS), on December 29, 1988. The letter noted several events thathad occurred since the final EIS was filed by EPA in 1984 and requestedthat EPA consider updating the EIS. Specifically, MMS cited the apparentlyelevated concentrations of mercury in Norton Sound sediments. A responsewas provided to MMS by letter dated February 21, 1989. That letter acknowledgedthe serious concerns raised by MMS regarding the quality of sediments throughoutNorton Sound. However, these concerns were judged to be more appropriatelyhandled as a part of site management rather than site designation. As statedelsewhere in this rule, site designation does not constitute or imply approvalof actual disposal of materials at sea. Accordingly, updating of the finalEIS was determined to be unnecessary. On February 27, 1989, following coordinationwith the Corps of Engineers, a letter was sent to the District Engineerof the Alaska District advising him that sediments from Nome harbor maybe unacceptable for unrestricted disposal and recommending that a sedimenttesting program be jointly developed to address this situation. Coordinationto develop this testing plan is proceeding. Dredged sediments found tobe unsuitable for unrestricted ocean disposal will not be disposed of ateither Nome site. The sites are located adjacent to shore, west and east of the entrancechannel to Nome harbor and occupy a total area of about 0.67 square nauticalmiles. Water depths within the areas range from 1 meter along the shorelineboundary to maximum depths of 11 and 12 meters along the southern boundaryof the Western and Eastern ODMDS respectively. The coordinates of the sitesare as follows:   The Western ODMDS is located adjacent to the west of the entrance channelto the Nome, Alaska, harbor. It abuts the shore and extends seaward coveringan area of 0.30 square nautical miles. Its corner coordinates are:<ITAG tagnum="26">64anddegrees;30andmin172;04&quot;N., 165anddegrees;25andmin172;52&quot;W.; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">64anddegrees;29andmin172;18&quot;N., 165anddegrees;26andmin172;04&quot;W.; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">64anddegrees;29andmin172;13&quot;N., 165anddegrees;25andmin172;22&quot;W.; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">64anddegrees;29andmin172;54&quot;N., 165anddegrees;24andmin172;45&quot;W.; </ITAG>The Eastern ODMDS is located adjacent to the east of the entrance channelto the Nome, Alaska, harbor. It abuts the shore and extends seaward coveringan area of 0.37 square nautical miles.

Regulatory Requirements</ITAG>Five general criteria are used in the selection and approval of ocean disposalsites for continuing use. Sites are selected so as to minimize interferencewith other marine activities, to keep any temporary perturbations fromthe dumping from causing impacts outside the disposal site, and to permiteffective monitoring to detect any adverse impacts at an early stage. Wherefeasible, locations off the Continental Shelf are chosen. If at any timedisposal operations at an interim site cause unacceptable adverse impacts,the use of that site will be terminated as soon as suitable alternate disposalsites can be designated. The general criteria are given in andSection;228.5of the EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations, and andSection;228.6 lists eleven specificfactors used in evaluating a proposed disposal site to assure that thegeneral criteria are met.The sites, as discussed below under the eleven specific factors, are acceptableunder the five general criteria, except for the preference for sites locatedoff the Continental Shelf. EPA has determined, based on the informationpresented in the Draft and Final EIS, that a site off the Continental Shelfis not feasible and that no environmental benefit would be obtained byselecting such a site instead of this action. Historical use at the existingsites has not resulted in substantial adverse effects to living resourcesof the ocean or to other uses of the marine environment.The characteristics of the sites are reviewed below in terms of the elevenfactors.1. Geographical Position, Depth of Water, Bottom Topography, and DistanceFrom Coast. 40 CFR 228.6(a)(1)Geographical positions and distances from the coast for each site are givenabove. Water depth at the sites ranges from 1 to 12 meters. Bottom topographyis similar at both sites. Slope gradient is 1:120 to about _13 meters.2. Location in Relation to Breeding, Spawning, Nursery, Feeding, or PassageAreas of Living Resources in Adult and Juvenile Phases. 40 CFR 228.6(a)(2)Breeding, spawning, nursery, and/or passage activities of commerciallyimportant finfish and shellfish species typical of the Norton Sound alloccur on a seasonal basis in or near the proposed sites. The two sitescomprise a small portion of the available habitat of the Sound. No uniquebreeding, spawning, nursery, or passage areas for living resources occurin the sites. Feeding of Gray Whales may reach to within about 770 metersof Nome's shoreline. Anticipated disposal volumes represent about 2 percentof natural annual sediment transport for the Norton Sound area. Accordingly,any impacts would be of very short duration and minor in nature.3. Location in Relation to Beaches and Other Amenity Areas. 40 CFR 228.6(a)(3)Both sites adjoin the shore at their northern boundary. Thus, they arein close proximity to the beaches on either side of the entrance channelto Nome harbor.4. Types and Quantities of Wastes Proposed To Be Disposed of, and ProposedMethods of Release, Including Methods of Packing the Waste, If Any. 40CFR 228.6(a)(4)Sediments from operations and maintenance dredging of the Nome harbor havebeen deposited annually in either site since 1923. It is expected thatdisposal of project sands and silts from the turning basin and entrancechannel will continue to occur during summer months at an estimated annualvolume of 13,000 cubic yards. The interim sites are immediately adjacentto the dredging areas and their use will minimize transport time. All dredgedmaterial disposed at the sites must comply with the requirements of EPA'sOcean Dumping Regulations.5. Feasibility of Surveillance and Monitoring. 40 CFR 228.6(a)(5)Surveillance and monitoring of the sites can be accomplished because ofthe proximity to shore and the shallow depths of the sites. Monitoringby EPA, the Corps of Engineers, and permittees, as required, will occuras long as the site is used. If evidence of significant environmental effectsis found, EPA will take appropriate action to alter or terminate disposalpractices at the site(s).6. Dispersal, Horizontal Transport and Vertical Mixing Characteristicsof the Area, Including Prevailing Current Direction, and Velocity. 40 CFR228.6(a)(6)Littoral drift will be a primary force causing dispersion of material atthe sites. Except for a small portion of their outer limits in mid-summer,the sites are in a single mixed zone. Both sites are in a highly dynamicenvironment with an estimated 650,000 cubic yards of sediments transportedannually under natural conditions. Transport direction appears to be predominantlyeasterly, but has been interrupted by construction of a 2,600-foot longbreakwater/port facility. Plans exist to increase the length of the breakwaterto a total of 3,500 linear feet in the future. Disposal at the easternor western site would occur to complement littoral drift patterns and preventsignificant build-up or erosion of sediments.7. Existence and Effects of Current and Previous Discharges and Dumpingin the Area (Including Cumulative Effects). 40 CFR 228.6(a)(7)The sites have been used for dredged material disposal annually since 1923.There has been no indication that these disposal events have materiallyaltered the characteristics of the sites.8. Interference With Shipping, Fishing, Recreation, Mineral Extraction,Desalination, Fish and Shellfish Culture, Areas of Special Scientific Importance,and Other Legitimate Uses of the Ocean. 40 CFR 228.6(a)(8)Ice forms in Norton Sound during the winter months, restricting all commercialand recreational vessel traffic. The sites lie outside the navigation channel.While there is need for navigation coordination during dredging and disposal,these operations are not expected to interfere with commercial shippingin the area. Some restrictions on recreational activities may be necessaryin the vicinity of dredging and disposal activities. The sites do not uniquelysupport fisheries, but commercial and subsistence shellfishing do exist.Accordingly, fishing and fish and shellfish culture could be affected atthe site during and immediately after disposal operations. Significantinterference with these activities is not expected. No interference withmineral extraction, desalination, areas of special scientific importance,or other legitimate uses of the ocean are anticipated.9. The Existing Water Quality and Ecology of the Site as Determined byAvailable Data or By Trend Assessment of Baseline Surveys. 40 CFR 228.6(a)(9)Evaluation of existing information indicates that disposal of dredged sedimentsfrom Nome harbor will have minimal impact on the water quality and ecologyof the sites. The area is a dynamic, high-energy environment; water qualityparameters (concentrations of dissolved nutrients, trace metals, dissolvedoxygen, pH, etc.) and biological characteristics (planktonic and benthiccommunities) are not expected to be significantly altered by dredging ordisposal activities. Temporary reductions in water quality and minor, temporarydisruptions to biological communities within the sites during and afterdisposal will occur.10. Potentiality for the Development or Recruitment of Nuisance Speciesin the Disposal Site. 40 CFR 228.6(a)(10)There appears to be little, if any, potential for development or recruitmentof nuisance species in the disposal sites.11. Existence At or In Close Proximity to the Site of Any Significant Naturalor Cultural Features of Historical Importance. 40 CFR 228.6(a)(11)There are no known cultural or historic properties in close proximity ofthe Nome sites that could be affected by disposal activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Action</ITAG>The EIS concluded that either or both of the sites may be appropriatelydesignated for use. The sites are compatible with the general criteriaand specific factors used for site evaluation. Designation of the Easternsite was specifically proposed as this site was most frequently used. Becauseof considerations for littoral drift, which may be affected by the currentor proposed to be expanded breakwater, designation of the Western siteis also proposed. Determination whether a particular year's dredged materialwould go to the Western or Eastern site will be made on a case-by-casebasis by the Corps of Engineers, with review by EPA.The designation of the Western and Eastern ODMDS as EPA approved OceanDumping Sites is being published as final rulemaking. Management of thesites will be delegated to the Regional Administrator of EPA Region X.It should be emphasized that, when an ocean dumping site is designated,such a designation does not constitute or imply EPA's approval of actualdisposal of material at sea. Before ocean dumping of dredged material atthe site may commence, the Corps of Engineers must evaluate a permit applicationaccording to EPA's ocean dumping criteria. EPA will make an independentevaluation of the permit application and has the right to disapprove theactual dumping if it determines that environmental concerns under the Acthave not been met.<ITAG tagnum="84">F. Regulatory Assessments</ITAG>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to perform a RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis for all rules which may have a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities. EPA has determined that thisaction will not have a significant impact on small entities since the sitedesignation will only have the effect of providing a disposal option fordredged material. Consequently, this does not necessitate preparation ofa Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This action will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100million or more or cause any other effects which would result in its beingclassified by the Executive Order as a ``major'' rule. Consequently, thisrule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This Final Rule does not contain any information collection requirementssubject to Office of Management and Budget review under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 228</ITAG>Water pollution control.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ralph R.
