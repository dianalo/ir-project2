Background</ITAG>A. AuthorityUnder 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22, facilities may petition the Agency to removetheir wastes from hazardous waste control by excluding them from the listsof hazardous wastes contained at 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32. Petitionersmust provide sufficient information to EPA to allow the Agency to determine(1) that the waste to be excluded is not hazardous based upon the criteriafor which it was listed, and (2) that no other hazardous constituents arepresent in the wastes at levels of regulatory concern.B. History of the RulemakingMerck andamp; Company, Incorporated (Merck), located in Elkton, Virginia,petitioned the Agency for a one-time exclusion of certain solid wastesgenerated at its facility and contained in an on-site fly ash lagoon. Afterevaluating the petition, EPA proposed, on September 27, 1988, to excludeMerck's waste from the lists of hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261.31 and261.32 (see 53 FR 37601).This rulemaking addresses public comments received on the proposal andfinalizes the proposed exclusion.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Disposition of Delisting Petition</ITAG>A. Merck andamp; Company, Incorporated, Elkton, Virginia1. Proposed ExclusionMerck petitioned the Agency for an exclusion of its incinerator fly ashcontained in an on-site lagoon. The fly ash is derived from and listedas EPA Hazardous Waste No. F002. Merck petitioned to exclude its wastebecause it does not believe that the waste meets the criteria of the listing.Merck further believes that the waste is not hazardous for any other reason(<T3>i.e., </T3>there are no additional constituents or factors that couldcause the waste to be hazardous). In support of its petition, Merck submitted(1) a detailed description of its manufacturing and treatment processes,including schematic diagrams; (2) a list of raw materials used in the manufacturingprocesses; (3) results from total constituent analyses of the fly ash containedin the lagoon for methylene chloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and certainother hazardous organic constituents potentially present in the waste;(4) results from EP toxicity and total constituent analyses for the EPtoxic metals and nickel; (5) results from total cyanide analyses; (6) massbalance calculations for methylene chloride, benzene, chloroform, and xyleneto provide maximum possible concentrations in the fly ash; (7) resultsfrom total oil and grease analyses; (8) test data on the hazardous wastecharacteristics of the fly ash; and (9) ground-water monitoring information(analytical data and hydrogeologic information) relevant to the lagoon.The Agency evaluated the information and analytical data provided by Merckin support of its petition and determined that the hazardous constituentsfound in the petitioned waste would not pose a threat to human health andthe environment. Specifically, the Agency used its Vertical and HorizontalSpread (VHS) model and Organic Leachate Model (OLM) to predict the potentialmobility of the hazardous constituents found in the petitioned waste. TheAgency also evaluated ground-water monitoring information submitted insupport of Merck's petition. Based on these evaluations, the Agency determinedthat the constituents in Merck's waste would not leach and migrate at concentrationsabove the health-based levels used in delisting decision-making. See 53FR 37601, September 27, 1988, for a more detailed explanation of why EPAproposed to grant Merck's petition for the fly ash contained in its lagoon.2. Agency Response to CommentsThe Agency received public comments on the proposed rule from one interestedparty. The commenter opposed the Agency's proposed decision, indicatingthe Merck has not submitted sufficient evidence to demonstrate that itswaste is non-hazardous. The comments related to the following areas: (1)Sampling procedures/methodologies, (2) analytical method, detection limits,and parameters, (3) mass balance calculations, (4) VHS model data versusreal data, (5) interpretation of ground-water monitoring data, and (6)other comments. The Agency's responses to these comments are discussedin the following sections.a. <T3>Sampling Procedures/Methodologies. </T3>The commenter stated that the`'fixed grid'' sampling technique used by the petitioner for sample locationselection was inappropriate because it did not consider horizontal variability.The commenter suggested that sampling points should have been randomlyspaced on a horizontal grid.The Agency has compared the representativeness of fixed grid sampling approacheslike Merck's to random sampling. The results of this study, which statisticallydetermined the probability of locating areas of high concentration withina waste management unit, demonstrate that fixed grid sampling is at leastas likely to detect ``hot spots'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>areas of high concentrations of hazardous constituents)as random sampling. (See the RCRA public docket for this notice for a summaryof this statistical study.) Therefore, for the fly ash lagoon, the Agencybelieves that the combined results of the fixed grid sampling conductedin 1982, 1984, and 1985 are sufficiently representative of the waste inthe lagoon.The commenter asserted that because process changes occurred in the wastewatertreatment system during the period in which wastes were discharged to thefly ash lagoon (between 1980 and 1985), vertical stratification of ashin Merck's lagoon is likely. Therefore, Merck's grab samples were not representativeof all of the waste in the lagoon and full-core samples should have beencollected.Because of changes in Merck's manufacturing and treatment processes whichoccurred during the life of the petitioned unit, the Agency agrees withthe commenter that the petitioned fly ash may exhibit vertical variability.The Agency generally requests petitioners to collect full-core samplesfrom such potentially stratified wastes. However, in Merck's case, theash depth in the lagoon averaged only 16 inches, with no depth greaterthan 19 inches. Furthermore, it is expected that the ash in the lagoonis not compacted. For these reasons, the Agency believes that Merck's grabsampling approach (dredging the ash layer with a bucket) should have obtainedmaterial from all potential layers of the lagoon ash and, thus, representsany vertical stratification of waste in the lagoon.b. <T3>Analytical Methods/Detection Limits/Parameters. </T3>The commenterstated that analytical methods used for organic constituent analyses ofMerck's waste did not always conform with SW-846 analytical methods andthat Merck did not provide any explanation regarding this deviation.The Agency allows petitioners to use EPA-approved methods other than thoselisted in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Wastes: Physical/ChemicalMethods,'' U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, PublicationSW-846 (third edition), November 1986 (SW-846), if those methods are appropriatefor the petitioned waste. The Agency notes that in cases where SW-846 methodswere not used, Merck used EPA-approved methods from ``Methods for ChemicalAnalysis of Water and Waste,'' USEPA, 1979, or ``Methods for Organic ChemicalAnalysis of Municipal and Industrial Wastewater,'' USEPA, 1982. The Agencybelieves that these methods are acceptable for the analysis of Merck'sfly ash.The commenter stated that the detection limits achieved by Merck for theorganic constituents exceed the practical quantification limits (PQLs)suggested in SW-846 for such a waste matrix. The commenter also noted thatMerck was able to quantify concentrations of benzene in the range of 0.006ppm to 0.22 ppm from carbon cake solids collected from a carbon cake pitnear the lagoon, but could only achieve detection limits of 1.0 ppm forthe lagoon fly ash.As stated in the proposed exclusion, the Agency believes that the detectionlimits achieved by Merck, obtained using appropriate analytical methods,represented, at the time, the lowest quantifiable concentrations for theorganic constituents. In addition, Merck provided mass balance demonstrationsfor methylene chloride, benzene, chloroform, and xylene to further showthat these hazardous constituents could not be present in the waste atlevels of concern. The commenter's comparison of the detection limits achievedfor analyses of carbon cake solids and the fly ash is not valid becauseof the differences between the sample matrices. The Agency notes that itdoes request petitioners to collect and analyze additional representativesamples when the Agency's evaluation indicates that reported PQLs werenot the lowest quantifiable concentrations of hazardous constituents inthe waste, and when the reported PQLs indicate that constituents couldbe present at hazardous levels. In Merck's case, however, EPA believesthat the detection limits were adequate.The commenter also stated that the Oily Waste Extraction Procedure (OWEP)should have been used in lieu of the standard Extraction Procedure (EP)for all leachate analyses, because 2 of 4 samples collected by Merck in1985 had total oil and grease (TOG) levels that exceeded one percent. Whenthe total oil and grease content exceeds one percent, petitioners are requestedto modify the standard EP procedure in accordance with the OWEP methodology.(Wastes having more than one percent total oil and grease either may havesignificant concentrations of constituents of concern in the oil phasewhich may not be assessed using the standard EP leachate procedure, orthe concentration of oil and grease may be sufficient to coat the solidphase of the sample and interfere with the leaching of metals from thesample.) The commenter suggested the possibility that these levels werenot a result of laboratory error, as claimed by Merck, but were insteadthe result of unidentified discharges to the lagoon.In 1987, after reviewing the 1985 TOG data and discussing the issue withMerck, the Agency allowed Merck to provide additional sampling data todemonstrate that TOG levels in the ash did not exceed one percent. As amatter of policy in cases such as this, the Agency allows petitioners toprovide evidence to sufficiently demonstrate that a laboratory error hasoccurred. As noted by the commenter, the petitioner submitted data fromanalyses of ten samples of the waste that were analyzed for TOG in 1987.The TOG levels in these samples ranged from 0.0019 to 0.135 percent. Basedon these results and the TOG levels (0.63, 0.33, and 0.49 percent) forthe three representative samples of the waste that were collected and analyzedfor TOG in 1984, the Agency maintains its belief that the 1985 TOG datawere most likely a result of laboratory error. Regardless of the sourceof the oil and grease in the waste, which the Agency believes could beattributed to <T3>de minimus </T3>losses of oil and grease from normal manufacturing,maintenance, and transportation operations as suggested by the petitioner,we believe Merck has demonstrated that the TOG content of the waste isless then one percent. Furthermore, the Agency is not aware of any dischargesto the lagoon which would contain significant levels of oil and grease,nor did the commenter suggest what the ``unidentified sources of oil andgrease'' could be.The commenter suggested that the analytical work requested of the petitionerwas incomplete because <T3>all</T3> collected samples were not analyzed for the EP leachate andtotal constituent concentrations of the EP metals, nickel and cyanide;total constituent concentrations of hazardous organic constituents potentiallypresent in the waste; TOG content; and the characteristics of ignitability,reactivity, and corrosivity.Merk's fly ash lagoon dimensions are 100 feet by 200 feet. According tostandard delisting protocol provided in ``Petitions to Delist HazardousWastes_A Guidance Manual,'' U.S. EPS, Office of Solid Waste, (EPA/530-SW-85-003),April 1985, petitioners like Merck, with lagoons of less than 40,000 squarefeet, are required to conduct analyses on at least four representativesamples. The 1982 samples were determined not to be fully representativeof the waste, therefore all of the analyses performed in 1982 were repeatedon representative samples collected in 1984 and 1985. These analyses included:EP leachate and total constituent analysis for the EP toxic metals andnickel, total constituent analysis for cyanide, total constituent analysisfor hazardous organic constituents potentially present in the waste, totaloil and grease analysis, and the determination of ignitability, reactivity,and corrosivity. TOG analyses were only performed on the 1984 and 1985samples because the Agency did not initiate the use of the OWEP for oilywaste matrices until 1984. Additional TOG analyses were requested in 1987to confirm that TOG did not exceed one percent. Therefore, the Agency believesthat Merck's analyses are complete and fully characterize the waste.c. <T3>Mass Balance Calculations. </T3>The commenter stated that the 96.1percent Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) removal rate assumed by Merck forthe wastewater treatment system was not appropriate because of the changesin Merck's wastewater treatment processes which occurred between 1980 and1985. Instead, the commenter believed the lowest BOD removal rate in effectduring this period should be used in the mass balance calculations in orderto quantify the maximum concentrations of constituents in the waste. (TheAgency notes that Merck justified the use of this removal rate in the massbalance calculations by citing the EPA's Effluent Guidelines for the PharmaceuticalIndustry, which states that the average removal rate for a direct dischargebiological system for priority pollutant solvents is 96.1 percent. Furthermore,Merck claims that their wastewater treatment is state-of-the-art and consistentlyaverages 96-98 percent removal for priority pollutant solvents.)As a result of this comment, the Agency re-evaluated Merck's mass balancedemonstration with respect to conditions of the wastewater treatment systemas it existed in 1982, when the petition was submitted. The only processchange that occurred prior to 1982 was the removal in March, 1981 of 1,1,1-trichloroethanefrom the list of materials influent to the wastewater treatment plant.Because no modifications were made to the operation of the wastewater treatmentsystem between 1980 and 1982, the Agency believes that removal efficiencyfor priority pollutants would not have changed during this period. Theprocess changes that occurred between 1982 and 1985 most likely would haveincreased the removal of the organic constituents which were consideredin the mass balance demonstration. For example, Merck's removal of theprimary sedimentation basin and rough trickling filters in 1983 eliminatedthose sludges influent to Merck's sludge handling system that would havehad the highest concentrations of organic constituents. (See the RCRA publicdocket for the proposed notice for a detailed discussion of Merck's wastewatertreatment process modifications.) In addition, the Agency believes thatthe 96.1 percent removal in the mass balances is acceptable for the entireperiod for the following reasons:<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Data from the sludge partitioning analysis for municipalwastewater treatment plants similar to Merck's, presented in the ``Reportto Congress on the Discharge of Hazardous Waste to POTWs,'' USEPA, Officeof Water, 1986, shows that the following percentages of these constituentsare transferred from influent to acclimated sludge: methylene chloride(14 percent), benzene (2 percent), chloroform (2 percent), and xylene (15percent).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Because all four constituents are volatile, it is highlylikely that a significant percentage of these constituents were air strippedduring the equalization and neutralization stages prior to biological treatment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Due to the volatility of these constituents, additional removalwas undoubtedly achieved in the sludge handling system, where waste sludgewas treated for several days in aeration basins.</ITAG>The Agency also reexamined the mass balance for methylene chloride, theconstituent that generated a compliance point concentration closest toits level of regulatory concern. To clearly understand the impact of BODremoval rate on the methylene chloride mass balance demonstration, theAgency back-calculated the BOD removal rate necessary to ensure that methylenechloride levels at the compliance point are below the corresponding health-basedlevel used in delisting decisionmaking. The Agency calculated this ``necessary''removal rate to be 72.5 percent, which is significantly less than the 96.1percent removal rate expected to be achieved by Merck's wastewater treatmentsystem. (See the RCRA public docket for today's notice for documentationof these calculations.)The commenter stated that a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of99.99 percent for hazardous waste incinerators is a RCRA performance goalthat is not easily achieved and that most incinerators do not meet thislevel without modification.The Agency believes that most incinerators can readily achieve a DRE of99.99 percent for organic constituents in fly ash and many achieve 99.99percent. For multiple-hearth incinerators such as Merck's, that are designedto both burn and volatilize organic constituents, the assumption of 99.99percent destruction is reasonable, as documented in several sources, includingthe ``Background Document for Kiln Regulatory Impact Analysis,'' USEPA,Office of Solid Waste, 1984. These sources verify that a 99.99 percentDRE is commonly achieved for volatile organic constituents such as methylenechloride, benzene, chloroform, and xylene, as measured in the resultingfly ash.In order to address this comment further and to illustrate clearly theimpact of DRE on Merck's mass balance demonstration, the Agency reexaminedMerck's mass balance demonstrations using a less stringent DRE of 99.9.This DRE was achieved for volatile organic constituents by virtually allkiln incinerators tested to support preparation of the ``Background Documentfor Kiln Regulatory Impact Analysis'' described above. For this DRE, thecompliance-point concentrations of methylene chloride, benzene, chloroform,and xylene were calculated as presented in Table 1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,14,9.4</C><T4>TABLE </T4>1<ITAG tagnum="96"/>VHS Model: Compliance-Point Concentrations (ppm) Fly Ash (Assuming99.9 Percent Destruction Efficiency)<H1/><T3>Constituents </T3><H1/><T3>Compliance-Point Concentrations </T3><H1/><T3>Levels of Regulatory Concern \1\</T3><ITAG tagnum="1">Methylene Chloride <D>0.0010 </D><D>0.0047</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloroform <D>0.0001 </D><D>0.0057</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene <D>0.0001 </D><D>0.005</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylene <D>0.0005 </D><D>70.</D><F>\1\ See ``Docket Report on Health-based Regulatory Levels and SolubilitiesUsed in the Evaluation of Delisting Petitions,'' June 8, 1988, locatedin the RCRA Public Docket.</F></ITAG></ITAG>As shown, the compliance-point concentrations of these constituents, assuminga DRE of 99.9 percent, are still below the delisting health-based levelsof concern.The commenter noted that the mass balance calculation for methylene chlorideyields a total methylene chloride concentration in the waste that exceedsthe level of regulatory concern.The Agency recognizes that the total constituent concentration of methylenechloride exceeds the delisting health-based level and indirectly notedso by the data presented in the proposed exclusion (see 53 FR 37604). However,the Agency does not believe it is appropriate to evaluate Merck's wasteby comparing the total constituent concentration of methylene chlorideto the delisting health-based level used for consumption of ground water.The Agency's evaluation of Merck's waste is based on the leachability ofhazardous constituents from the ash and the ultimate environmental fateand transport of these constituents. The Agency used the Organic LeachateModel (OLM) to predict the leachable portion of the organic constituentsin the waste. The results of the OLM analyses were used with the Agency'svertical and horizontal spread (VHS) model to determine compliance-pointconcentrations. As presented in the September 27, 1988 proposed exclusion,the calculated compliance-point concentration for methylene chloride is0.00019 ppm which is below the delisting health-based level of 0.0047 ppm.d. <T3>VHS Modeling Data versus Real Data. </T3>The commenter stated thatdue to unreasonable assumptions in the mass balance calculations, the inputdata used by EPA for the OLM/VHS models led to an underestimation of thepotential for contamination from the lagoon. To support this assertion,the commenter provided a comparison of the calculated compliance-pointconcentrations for chloroform, benzene, xylene, arsenic, lead, and nickel,and actual ground-water monitoring data for these constituents.The Agency has already addressed the commenter's criticism of the massbalance calculations. As noted previously, the Agency believes that themass balance calculations were valid and were appropriate input parametersfor the OLM/VHS models.The Agency uses models such as the OLM and VHS model to estimate the potentialmigration of hazardous constituents from the unregulated disposal of petitionedwastes. The Agency also considers any other available information, suchas ground-water monitoring data relevant to the petitioned waste, to characterizethe impact on ground-water quality (if any) from the disposal of the waste.Because of the differences between the hypothetical VHS landfill and Merck'sfly ash lagoon and other site-specific conditions (<T3>e.g.,</T3> the compliance point assumed by the VHS is a well 500 feetdowngradient from the unit, while the wells monitoring the unit are muchcloser), the Agency recognizes that the calculated compliance-point concentrationsfor Merck's waste would not necessarily correspond directly with ground-watermonitoring data. Furthermore, the VHS model does not consider impacts onground-water quality associated with wastes other than the petitioned waste(<T3>e.g.</T3>, alternate sources of contamination). In this case, the Agencybelieves that ground-water quality beneath the petitioned unit is beingaffected by releases from other solid waste management units at this facility.Therefore, the Agency used VHS model results in conjunction with actualground-water monitoring data to fully evaluate (not to verify) the impactsof the disposal of Merck's waste. Both the calculated compliance-pointconcentrations for all constituents and the actual ground-water concentrationsfor all constituents except benzene (discussed below) are below the Agency'slevels of regulatory concern.e. <T3>Interpretation of Ground-Water Monitoring Data. </T3>In the proposedexclusion, the Agency stated that it had reviewed six rounds of ground-watermonitoring data for Merck's fly ash lagoon. The ground-water monitoringdata were collected from seven wells, three upgradient (MW-14 through MW-16)and four downgradient (MW-17 through MW-20) of the fly ash lagoon, thatare monitored in compliance with 40 CFR Part 265, Subpart F requirements.(Figure 1 presents a map of the site, including the location of waste managementunits and ground-water monitoring wells.) The Agency stated that reviewof the six rounds of data indicated that the concentrations of all hazardousconstituents analyzed pursuant to Subpart F, except benzene, were belowthe Agency's delisting health-based levels of concern or acceptable methoddetection limits. In the proposed exclusion, the Agency presented ground-watermonitoring data for benzene which showed that a single ground-water samplecollected from downgradient well MW-17 on December 15, 1986 contained benzeneat a concentration of 0.006 ppm, which exceeds the Agency's 0.005 ppm levelof concern for benzene.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustation 0 1276</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>In the proposed exclusion, the Agency stated that it believes that thepetitioned waste is not the source of elevated concentrations of benzenein ground water. The Agency's justification for this conclusion is two-fold.First, benzene was not detected in representative samples of the petitionedwaste and is not expected to be present in the petitioned waste at significantconcentrations (based on mass balance calculations which consider boththe destruction efficiency of the incinerator which generated the fly ashand the removal efficiency of Merck's wastewater treatment system). Inaddition, the Agency believes that Merck sufficiently demonstrated thatother solid waste management units in the vicinity of the fly ash lagoon(<T3>e.g.</T3>, an unlined landfill and an unlined carbon cake pit) arelikely sources of the benzene detected in ground water. The proposed exclusionpresented benzene analyses for solid samples collected from the carboncake pit and benzene analyses for ground-water samples collected from wellHE-8, which is located adjacent to the carbon cake pit. The proposal furtherreported that benzene was detected in ground water collected from wellHE-8 at concentrations exceeding the Agency's level of regulatory concernfor benzene (0.005 ppm).The single interested party commenting on the proposed exclusion submitteda number of comments regarding the Agency's interpretation of Merck's ground-watermonitoring data. These comments, and the Agency's responses, are presentedin the following discussions.<T3>The Agency's Use of Ground-Water Monitoring Data from Well HE-8</T3>.The commenter believed that the Agency's conclusion regarding other likelysources of benzene in ground water must have been based on the fact thatbenzene was detected in well HE-8 at the 0.005 ppm level. The commentermaintained that this conclusion is unfounded for several reasons. First,the commenter stated that the petitioner was informed on September 15,1986 ``that well HE-8 was not an appropriate monitoring well because thewater table map included in the Part B permit application indicated thatthis well was not upgradient of the lagoon''. Second, the commenter suggestedthat comparisons between well HE-8 and the fly ash lagoon's monitoringwell network are inappropriate because the well screens are not comparablysituated and the well screens are of differing lengths. Third, the commenterclaimed that well HE-8 is constructed in an area which is geologicallydifferent from that in which wells monitoring the fly ash lagoon (wellsMW-14 through MW-20) are constructed.The Agency wishes to clarify that its conclusion that other sources ofbenzene contamination exist at the facility is not based solely on ground-watermonitoring data from well HE-8. The Agency believes that the landfill isa reasonable source of the benezene detected in the wells downgradientof the fly ash lagoon for two reasons. First, as stated in Merck's petition,Merck informed the Agency that from 1941 to 1980 the landfill receivedmost of the solid waste generated at the Merck facility, including tarwastes from solvent recovery processes. Although Merck has not specificallydetermined that benzene is present in the landfill, the Agency believesthere is reasonable basis to conclude that wastes containing benzene weredisposed of in the landfill, because Merck's solvent recovery processesare known to produce wastes containing benzene. Second, the fly ash lagoon'sdowngradient wells are located on or near a subsurface fracture \1\<NOTE/> on which the landfill is also located. The fracture couldprovide a preferential path along which contaminated ground-water emanatingfrom the landfill could flow or migrate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Fracture is a general term for any break in a rock. Inkarst terrains, fractures may be enlarged when water causes chemical dissolutionof carbonate. Fractures are typically concentrated in zones. Fracture zonesoften have hydraulic conductivities greater than that of adjacent rock(<T3>e.g.</T3>, statistical studies of wells located in carbonate terrainhave shown that wells located on fractures have greater yield than thosenot located on fractures) (see Siddiqui and Parizek, 1971, in the RCRApublic docket.) In its petition, Merck provided confirmation of the existenceof subsurface fractures at their Elkton facility. (For further detail,see correspondence from the petitioner to Suzanne Rudzinski, EPA, datedDecember 18, 1987, in the RCRA public docket.)In response to the first comment concerning well HE-8, the Agency reviewedthe water-level contour map \2\<NOTE/> from Merck's Part B permit application referred to by thecommenter. This review revealed that the water-level contour map was constructedusing water levels measured in wells which comprise an older well systemno longer used to monitor the fly ash lagoon. (The present monitoring systemat the fly ash lagoon (wells MW-14 through MW-20) did not exist in September1986 when Merck was informed by the State that well HE-8 was not an appropriateupgradient monitoring well.) The wells on which the water-level contourmap is based have five-foot well screens that are placed within an intervalfrom approximately 936 feet to 952 feet in elevation \3\<NOTE/> (23 to 42 feet below land surface). Well HE-8 also has afive-foot screen, but the interval over which the screen is placed is muchdeeper (approximately 894 to 904 feet in elevation, or 74 to 84 feet belowland surface). It is generally inappropriate to contour or compare waterlevels measured in wells that are screened at different elevation. Therefore,the Agency does not believe that it is useful to use the water-level contourmap in the Part B permit application, which represents ground-water flowas measured in shallow monitoring wells, to establish whether well HE-8is upgradient of the fly ash lagoon.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ A water-level contour map depicts lines (called equipotentiallines) which connect points of equal water-level elevation or head. Ground-waterflow is usually assumed perpendicular to equipotential lines. As a result,water-level contour maps can be used to determine direction of ground-waterflow.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ All elevations are reported as elevation above mean sealevel.Nevertheless, the Agency re-evaluated whether the carbon cake pot is upgradientof the wells downgradient of the fly ash lagoon and again concluded thatthe pit is indeed upgradient. Based on water levels measured in the deeper(80-foot) wells presently used to monitor the fly ash lagoon (MW-14 throughMW-20) and expected flow along the subsurface fracture, EPA believes thatground water flowing beneath the carbon cake pit could intercept the downgradientwells directly and/or via the subsurface fracture along which wells MW-17,MW-18 and MW-19 appear located. The commenter's second concern is that comparisons between data from wellHE-8 and the monitoring system for the fly ash lagoon are inappropriatedue to differences in the way the wells are screened. The Agency agreesthat ground-water monitoring data from the fly ash lagoon's present monitoringsystem cannot be strictly compared to data from well HE-8 because the lengthof HE-8's well screen (5 feet) is much shorter than those of the fly ashlagoon monitoring wells (40 feet). However, data for well HE-8 indicatethat a source other than the fly ash lagoon (ostensibly the carbon cakepit) has contaminated the ground water in the geological unit in which(and to the depth at which) the downgradient wells monitoring the lagoonare screened. Specifically, samples collected from well HE-8 containedas much as 0.26 ppm benzene. Therefore, the Agency believes that the benzenecontamination present in well HE-8 demonstrates the existence of a contaminantsource which is apparently upgradient of the lagoon's downgradient wells.The Agency believes the commenter's third concern regarding the differencebetween the geology of the area in which well HE-8 is constructed and thegeology of area in which wells MW-14 through MW-20 are constructed is unsupported.Well HE-8 is screened to approximately the same depth as the fly ash lagoonmonitoring wells (84 feet). Furthermore, based on well logs, HE-8 is screenedin the same geologic unit in which the downgradient wells MR-17, MW-18,MW-19, and MW-20 are screened (<T3>i.e., </T3>the limestone/dolomite of the upper surface of the Elbrookformation). <T3>Concerns Regarding the Ground-water Monitoring System. </T3>The commenterasserted that, when wells MW-14 through MW-20 were installed, both theVirginia Department of Waste Management (VDWM) and EPA Region III allowedlonger (40-foot) screens stating that such wells would be suitable onlyfor detection, not quantification, of ground-water contamination at thefly ash lagoon. The Agency acknowledges that the screened intervals for the fly ash lagoonmonitoring wells are long, and that the greater sampling interval allowedby the longer well screens may act to dilute contaminants associated witha vertically discrete contaminant plume. However, because ground-waterflow in fractured karst terrain (like that at the Merck facility) is expectedto occur primarily in fractures and solution channels, the longer screenedintervals could make the detection of contaminants more likely by increasingthe chance that the wells will potentially intercept paths of preferentialflow from the fly ash lagoon. The commenter claimed that because the monitoring system was installedin accordance with the Technical Enforcement Guidance Document (TEGD),the monitoring results should be ``binding'' (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the presence of contamination in downgradient wells compelsthe Agency to deny this petition). The commenter further explained thatMerck's monitoring system includes upgradient wells to account for suchfactors as alternate contaminant sources, if upgradient contaminant sourcesexist. The commenter believed that if the Agency finds the system inadequate,the Agency should require Merck to install another monitoring system, notconclude that contamination stems from other contaminant sources. The Agency believes that the commenter is concerned that the Agency chosenot to interpret statistical increases in pH and total organic carbon (TOC)which were reported for Merck's downgradient wells as confirmation thatthere has been a hazardous release from the fly ash lagoon. Parameterssuch as pH and TOC are indicator parameters which are appropriately usedto provide indications of a release of waste constituents to ground water.As discussed later, the Agency does not believe that the petitioned wasteis likely to be the source of the increase in pH or TOC. Furthermore, theextensive analyses for hazardous constituents (<T3>i.e., </T3>Appendix IC to 40 CFR Part 261) in samples collected fromthe monitoring system support the Agency's conclusion that the petitionedwaste has not adversely impacted the ground water. The Agency also believes that the commenter is concerned that the Agencychose not to interpret benzene data as confirmation that there has beena hazardous release from the fly and ash lagoon. The Agency acknowledgedin the proposed exclusion that the concentration of benzene in one samplecollected from a well that monitors the fly ash lagoon exceeds the Agency'shealth-based level of concern for benzene. As discussed in further detailabove, however, the Agency believes that Merck has demonstrated that thereis sufficient basis to conclude that the petitioned waste is not a sourceof the detected benzene. The Agency believes that Merck's mass balancecalculations adequately demonstrate that benzene is not expected to bepresent in the petitioned waste and therefore is not the source of benzenedetected in the fly ash lagoon's downgradient wells. In addition, the Agencybelieves that Merck has adequately shown that there are other sources forthe benzene detected in downgradient wells.  In response to the commenter's statements regarding the adequacy of theground-water monitoring system, the Agency agrees that the area upgradientof the fly ash lagoon is well monitored. However, the upgradient wellsdo not intercept all potential pathways for contaminant migration whichcould affect ground-water quality downgradient of the fly ash lagoon. Specifically,the upgradient wells do not monitor ground water which may migrate downthe subsurface fracture located near the west end of the fly ash lagoon.Additionally, the upgradient wells are not likely to intercept contaminantsemanating from the carbon cake pit. Nevertheless, the Agency believes thatadditional upgradient wells are not necessary to verify the existence ofother potential sources of ground-water contamination. As stated previouslyin today's notice and the proposed rule, Merck's mass balance demonstrationindicates that benzene concentrations in the fly ash lagoon waste are notof concern. Furthermore, Merck provided information which indicates thatreasonable alternate sources of benzene in ground water exist at the facility.Consequently, the Agency does not believe that it is necessary for thepetitioner to install additional monitoring wells at the fly ash lagoonfor the purpose of making a delisting decision.<T3>Consideration of Statistical Evaluations_Evaluation of pH.</T3> Thecommenter believes that the present monitoring system at the fly ash lagoonhas not been able to demonstrate that the fly ash lagoon is not impactingground-water quality. Specifically, the commenter stated that the presentground-water monitoring system for the fly ash lagoon indicates statisticalincreases for pH in all downgradient wells and for TOC in well MW-19. Thecommenter does not accept statements made in Merck's petition assertingthat the landfill is the likely source of the significant increase in pHreported in the monitoring wells downgradient of the fly ash lagoon. (Merckcontends that the pH of certain wastes disposed in the landfill rangesfrom 10 to 13.)In support of the commenter's belief that the fly ash lagoon has causedthe statistical increases in pH reported in the downgradient wells, andin rebuttal to Merck's claims that the landfill is a source of high pH,the commenter offered the following observations: (1) pH measurements ofthe petitioned waste made in 1982 (7.4 to 7.7 pH units) show that leachatefrom the petitioned waste is capable of increasing the pH of ground-waterdowngradient of the fly ash lagoon; (2) wells MW-18 and MW-19, based onthe results of pumping tests, appear to be located on a subsurface fracture,but no effect in the pH is apparent; (3) if a subsurface fracture is affectingwells MW-17, MW-18, and MW-19, well MW-19 should probably yield the highestpH results, yet the highet pH is found in well MW-17, and (4) well MW-17,which the commenter feels is equivalent hydrogeologically to the upgradientwells, shows a statistical increase in pH, and therefore leakage from thefly ash lagoon.In response to the commenter's first observation, the Agency believes thatthe 1982 pH data reported by Merck are invalid. The 1982 pH data were obtainedas part of the analytical procedure for the EP toxicity analysis and werenot intended to accurately characterize the pH of the petitioned waste.(See correspondence from the petitioner to Suzanne Rudzinski, EPA, datedDecember 18, 1987, in the RCRA public docket.) Furthermore, the samplesin which these pH values were measured were held for nine days prior toanalysis (pH should be measured as soon as possible after sample collection),and were diluted with distilled water prior to being measured for pH. Therefore,the Agency does not believe the commenter's concerns that the petitionedwaste could cause the increase in pH reported in the downgradient wellsare valid. The Agency believes that the actual pH of the waste in the flyash lagoon is between 6.8 and 7.1, as reported by the petitioner on June1, 1987. The pH of ground water collected from the upgradient monitoringwells ranges from 6.8 to 8.2; whereas, the range for the downgradient wellsis 7.3 to 9.0 (7.9 to 9.0 for well MW-17). Given that the pH of Merck'swaste is between 6.8 and 7.1, the Agency does not believe that the petitionedwaste caused the statistical increase in pH downgradient of the fly ashlagoon.With regard to the commenter's second, third, and fourth observations concerningpH, the Agency believes that the commenter was concerned that: (1) Groundwater from wells MW-18 and MW-19 should have higher pH levels than groundwater from well MW-17 because wells MW-18 and MW-19 appear most directlylocated on the subsurface fracture (as stated previously, a subsurfacefracture may act as a preferential ground water flow path from the landfillto the downgradient wells); (2) well MW-19 is closest to the landfill,therefore, the highest pH should be reported for well MW-19, yet the highestpH is reported for well MW-17 and; (3) well MW-17, which should be leastaffected by the subsurface fracture (and therefore the landfill), showsa statistical increase of pH, and therefore leakage from the fly ash lagoon.In response to these three observations, the Agency does not believe thatpH data can be used as a sole basis for confirming a source of contamination.Specifically, pH is dependent on a number of variables (<T3>e.g.,</T3> temperature and mixing of ground water) which can causeit to vary both spatially and temporally, regardless of the presence ofa contaminant source. (See Hem, 1985, in the RCRA public docket for thisrule.) The effect of these variables on pH might be even more pronouncedin fractured karst terrain, such as at the Merck facility, where increasedmixing of ground waters from different sources might be expected. (SeeHanshaw and Back, 1979, in the RCRA public docket for this rule.) Consequently,the Agency believes pH data such as that presented in the commenter's observationscannot be used by itself to demonstrate whether the fly ash lagoon hasadversely affected ground-water quality. The Agency notes not only thatthe landfill is a potential source of the high pH detected in ground-water,but also that the pH values reported for ground-water samples collectedfrom well HE-8 (9.4 to 12.6 pH units) also indicate that a source of highpH may exist in the vicinity of well HE-8.<T3>Evaluation of TOC. </T3>The commenter did not believe that the petitioner'smass balance demonstration, based on the operation and efficiency of thewastewater treatment plant and sludge incinerator, adequately eliminatedthe fly ash lagoon as a source of the elevated TOC observed in the downgradientmonitoring wells. As discussed previously in today's notice, the Agency agrees with the massbalance demonstrations submitted by the petitioner, and believes Merck'sclaims regarding the operation and efficiency of the wastewater treatmentplant and the sludge incinerator, on which the mass balance demonstrationsare partially based. In addition, the Agency believes that Merck fullycharacterized the organic carbon in ground water that can be attributedto hazardous constituents through the analyses of ground-water samplesfor the organic hazardous constituents listed in 40 CFR Part 264, AppendixIX. Moreover, the maximum TOC concentration reported in the upgradientwells (34 ppm) is much greater than the maximum reported in the downgradientwells (8 ppm), further supporting a conclusion that other sources of contaminationmay exist at the facility which are not associated with the fly ash lagoon.<T3>Evaluation of Additional Well MW-20 Statistical Analyses. </T3>Thecommenter maintained that statistical comparisons between upgradient anddowngradient wells that were to have been submitted to the Virginia Departmentof Waste Management after the installation of well MW-20 are vital in assessingthe impact of the fly ash lagoon on ground-water quality and should berequested from the petitioner before any final decision regarding the delistingpetition is made. Merck reported the results of hazardous constituent analyses for ground-watersamples collected from well MW-20, which the Agency believes fully characterizedground-water quality at the well. The Agency does not believe that it isnecessary to obtain and review new statistical evaluations for well MW-20because Merck has analyzed ground water collected from well MW-20 for over200 hazardous constituents listed in 40 CFR Part 264, Appendix IX, satisfyingdelisting ground-water monitoring requirements. <T3>The Agency's Consideration that Contamination Originated from OtherSources. </T3>The commenter noted that it is premature to suggest thatconstituents detected in the downgradient wells are derived solely fromalternate sources, especially when these same constituents are those expectedto be in the petitioned waste. Furthermore, the commenter also maintainedthat all ground-water monitoring systems installed for the fly ash lagoonhave indicated ground-water contamination. The Agency believes that data from the present monitoring system at thefly ash lagoon are more representative of ground-water quality at the flyash lagoon than data from previous well systems. As stated in Merck's petition,when the State accepted Merck's proposal that an earlier shallow monitoringsystem for the fly ash lagoon could not adequately provide samples of backgroundand downgradient water quality, Merck installed the present monitoringsystem for the fly ash lagoon. Monitoring of all previous well systemsfor the fly ash lagoon subsequently ceased. Consequently, in this case,the Agency focused its evaluation of Merck's delisting petition on resultsobtained from the approved monitoring system for the fly ash lagoon. The Agency considered the commenter's concerns that monitoring data fromthe present monitoring system at the fly ash lagoon have indicated ground-watercontamination. The Agency believes the commenter is concerned about pHand TOC data from the approved monitoring system which show statisticalincreases over background levels. The Agency believes that statisticalanalyses of indicator parameters are useful in determining whether wasteconstituents may be migrating to ground water. However, the concern tobe addressed by a delisting evaluation is whether the petitioned wasteis capable of releasing hazardous contaminants to the environment at concentrationsthat are of concern. EPA views analyses for specific hazardous constituentsas a more direct indication of possible ground-water contamination. Theseanalyses also assist the Agency in establishing whether any apparent statisticalincrease in indicator parameters is attributable to unacceptable concentrationsof hazardous constituents in ground water. Merck provides the Agency with one round of ground-water monitoring resultsfrom the approved monitoring system which include analyses for the over200 organic and inorganic constituents listed in 40 CFR Part 264 AppendixIX, and 5 additional rounds of ground-water monitoring results which includeanalyses for over 45 hazardous constituents. The Agency believes theseanalyses adequately characterize the composition of ground-water collectedfrom the monitoring system at the fly ash lagoon. The monitoring data demonstratethat the concentrations of hazardous constituents in ground-water samplescollected from the present monitoring system, with the exception of <T3>one </T3>benzene value, are below health-based levels of concern. TheAgency believes that Merck's mass balance calculations adequately demonstratethat benzene is not expected in the petitioned waste and therefore is notthe source of benzene detected in the fly ash lagoon's downgradient wells.In addition, the Agency believes Merck has adequately shown that thereare other sources for the benzene detected in downgradient wells. f. <T3>Other Comments. </T3>The commenter's final comment concerned the exactclassification of the lagoon fly ash as hazardous. The commenter claimedthat although the proposed notice focused exclusively on EPA HazardousWaste No. F002 as the basis for the listing, the fly ash lagoon also receivedwaste listed as EPA Hazardous Waste No. F003. The Agency believes that the commenter was concerned that the Agency didnot consider the listing criteria for EPA Hazardous Waste No. F003 whenit evaluated Merck's petition. However, EPA notes that F003 wastes areonly listed due to the characteristic of ignitability and the incineratorash does not exhibit this characteristic. Furthermore, regardless of thespecific listing criteria for Merck's waste, the Agency's evaluation consideredall factors that could cause the waste to be hazardous. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Final Agency Decision </ITAG>For the reasons stated in the proposal, the Agency believes that Merck'sincinerator fly ash contained in the on-site fly ash lagoon should be excludedfrom hazardous waste control. The Agency, therefore, is granting a finalone-time exclusion to Merck andamp; Company, Incorporated, located in Elkton,Virginia, for its fly ash described in its petition as EPA Hazardous WasteNo. F002. Although management of the waste covered by this petition is relieved fromSubtitle C jurisdiction, Merck must either (1) continue to manage the wastein the fly ash lagoon; or (2) treat, store or dispose of the waste in anotheron-site facility, or ensure that the waste is delivered to an off-sitestorage, treatment or disposal facility, either of which is permitted,licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or industrial solidwaste. Alternatively, the delisted waste may be delivered to a facilitythat beneficially uses or reuses, or legitimately recycles or reclaimsthe waste, or treats the waste prior to such beneficial use, reuse, recycling,or reclamation. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Limited Effect of Final Exclusion </ITAG>The final exclusion being granted today is being issued under the Federal(RCRA) delisting program. States, however, are allowed to impose theirown, non-RCRA regulatory requirements that are more stringent than EPA's,pursuant to section 3009 of RCRA. These more stringent requirements mayinclude a provision which prohibits a Federally-issued exclusion from takingeffect in the State. Because a petitioner's waste may be regulated undera dual system (<T3>i.e., </T3>both Federal (RCRA) and State (non-RCRA) programs), petitionersare urged to contact their State regulatory authority to determine thecurrent status of their wastes under the State law. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Effective Date </ITAG>This rule is effective immediately. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendmentsof 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effectivein less than six months when the regulated community does not need thesix-month period to come into compliance. That is the case here becausethis rule reduces, rather than increases, the existing requirements forpersons generating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessary hardshipand expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effective datesix months after promulgation and the fact that a six-month deadline isnot necessary to achieve the purpose of Section 3010, EPA believes thatthis rule should be effective immediately. These reasons also provide abasis for making this rule effective immediately, upon promulgation, underthe Administrative Procedure Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d). <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Impact </ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This rule to grant an exclusion is not major since its effect is to reducethe overall costs and economic impact of EPA's hazardous waste managementregulations. This reduction is achieved by excluding waste generated ata specific facility from EPA's lists of hazardous wastes, thereby enablingthe facility to treat its waste as non-hazardous. There is no additionaleconomic impact, therefore, due to today's rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e.,</T3> small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). The Administrator, or delegated representative may certify,however, that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities. This amendment will not have an adverse economic impact on small entitiessince its effect will be to reduce the overall costs of EPA's hazardouswaste regulations and is limited to one facility. Accordingly, I herebycertify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. This regulation, therefore,does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>Information collection and recordkeeping requirements associated with thisfinal rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-511,44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2050-0053.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 261 </ITAG>Hazardous materials, Waste treatment and disposal, Recycling. <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 3, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffery D.
