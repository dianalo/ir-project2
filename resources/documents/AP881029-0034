(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police are trying to calm townspeople asthey search for a murder suspect with an apparent taste for``strictly gore'' movies, and authorities promised extra Halloweenpatrols if he remains at large.   Many residents in the western Massachusetts town of 11,000 peoplesaid they would forbid their children from trick-or-treating ifpolice haven't arrested the suspect, Mark Branch, 18.   Branch is wanted in connection with the slaying of SharonGregory, a 19-year-old freshman at Greenfield Community College,whose body was found Monday in the bathroom of her family's home byher twin sister. Police said she had been stabbed repeatedly.   Using dogs and helicopters, police searched for Branch for thethird day Friday in woods in the nearby town of Buckland.Authorities issued a warrant for Branch's arrest Tuesday after hiscar was found abandoned in that town.   State police Sgt. Norm Roberts urged residents Friday to ignoreunfounded rumors of a second slaying, but he asked them to becareful because the suspect may be armed and dangerous.   ``It has thrown panic into a lot of people,'' he said of therumors.   A video store owner described Branch as an enthusiast of bloodyhorror films, particularly the ``Friday the 13th'' series thatfeatures a character who slashes his victims.   Bob Quesnel of Video Expo 1 in Greenfield said Branch has rentedand purchased hundreds of horror videos from his store. ``He rentedstrictly gore, period,'' he said. ``The gorier, the better.''   The community college canceled a Halloween dance because ofGregory's death.   Gary Sibilia, chief of nearby Ashfield police, said he isconsidering calling off the town's Halloween parade Monday if Branchis not found.   State police said the search has been made more difficult by agrowing nervousness in the community and repeated rumors of otherstabbings.   Greenfield Police Capt. Joseph LaChance said the department'sfive lines ``have been lit perpetually'' with inquiries about therumors.   Police said they were maintaining a round-the-clock patrol andchecking out numerous reports of sightings. But they said there wasno sign that Branch was in the area.   ``There are thousands of camps and shacks out in the woods,''said Greenfield Police Chief David McCarthy, noting that Branchcould be moving ``from camp to camp, or he could be a thousand milesaway.''   Gregory was the third woman murdered in the town in the past twoyears.   Greenfield High School helped its students cope with Gregory'smurder by offering counseling, said Vice Principal Ann McKenna.   ``Everyone still, including myself, is quite upset.'' McKennasaid. ``A lot of people knew Sharon. She only graduated last June.''</TEXT></DOC>
