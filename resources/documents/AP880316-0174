For years, people have complained about Galveston's murky waterand brown, narrow beaches, said Ralph McPheeters, administrator ofa development called Palm Beach at Moody Gardens.   ``What do most people think of when they think of beaches?'' heasked Tuesday. ``White sands.''   ``We can't do anything about the water but we sure can dosomething about the sand,'' he said.   Within two weeks, he said, two ocean barges full of white sandare expected from Orlando, Fla., he said. The sand, purchased fromOrlando sand mines, was selected because it has the rightconsistency and color for building sand castles, he added.   Mayor Jan Coggeshell said the white beach would be a welcomeaddition.   The development is the latest part of a multimillion-dollarproject on the shores of Offatts Bayou. It will accommodate 3,000people and include a 1,000-foot waterfront boardwalk and two hugefreshwater lagoons complete with a 12-foot waterfall and white sandbottom.</TEXT></DOC>
