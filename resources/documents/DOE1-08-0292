After being implanted at room temperature with 300 keV Xe/sup+/ to 2 x 10/sup 15/, 6 x 10/sup 15/ and 1 x 10/sup 16/ ions/cm/sup 2/,the multilayer samples of various compositions are analyzed with transmissionelectron diffraction. The structures of some samples of B-Ni and B-Feare transformed to amorphous state, and the remains are still in crystallinesate. A brief discussion on the results is included.</TEXT></DOC>
