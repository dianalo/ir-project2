The Bulgarian and Western sources identified the two as PetarManolov, 47, who lives in Plovdiv, 60 miles southeast of theBulgarian capital Sofia, and Ilya Minev, 71, from the town ofSeptemvri east of Plovdiv.   They are leading members of the dissident Independent Associationfor the Protection of Human Rights.   The sources, who spoke by telephone to The Associated Press andrefused to be identified further, said both men are likely to facetrial on various charges in an attempt by authorities to disrupt theassociation.   Newspaper articles in the state-run Bulgarian press this weekhinted that authorities are preparing to put Manolov, secretary ofthe association, and Minev, its chairman, on trial.   In a lengthy article Feb. 7, the Bulgarian Communist Party dailyWorkers' Daily commented:   ``Is there a state committed to the rule of law that will notcall to account the conspirators who make it their objective tooverthrow the lawfully established government and to undermine thefoundations of the social order?''   On Jan. 11, authorities raided Manolov's home and seized somewritten material, including association documents, Bulgarian emigresin Vienna said.   Workers' Daily published what it said was the program of theassociation. The program, as reported by the newspaper, calls onmembers to ``organize a massive movement, which in just a fewmonths' time will already be in a position to assume the reins ofgovernment.''   The newspaper suggested that if Minev is tried, he will becharged under an article of the constitution prohibitingorganizations that ``propagate a fascist or other anti-democraticideology'' and are ``directed against the socialist system of ...Bulgaria and the rights of citizens.''   Manolov would face charges of publishing pornography in a poem hewrote, the newspaper indicated. The text of the poem was not given.   According to one source, Manolov was visited by two doctors thisweek who described his condition as serious. The report could not beindependently confirmed. The condition of Minev was not known.
