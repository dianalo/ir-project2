U.S. District Chief Judge Aubrey E. Robinson acted Friday, justsix days before the jury was to be disbanded, to extend its workfor six more months, through Jan. 27, 1989. By then, PresidentReagan's successor will be in office.   Robinson, in his order, responded to a sealed motion fromindependent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to extend the inquiry, evenas Walsh's staff prepares for the scheduled Sept. 20 opening of thetrial of former White House aide Oliver North. Lawyers for Northhave asked that the trial be postponed until March 1989.   Walsh is expected to continue looking into the activities ofU.S. officials and others in Central America following theindictment last month of a former CIA station chief in Costa Rica,Joseph Fernandez.   An unspecified number of co-conspirators were cited along withFernandez in an illegal supply network aimed at getting funds tothe Contras in 1986, when Congress had banned U.S. aid to theNicaraguan rebels.   Robinson's order said the purpose of the extension was ``for theinvestigations identified by the government in its motion.''   Jim Wieghart, Walsh's spokesman, said he could not comment onspecifics of the planned investigations mentioned in the judge'sorder.   Walsh's investigation previously focused on U.S. fund-raisingefforts for the Contras, arms sales to Iran and the diversion ofprofits from the sales to the rebels.   This led to charges against North, former national securityadviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Richard V. Secord andAlbert Hakim for their roles in the Iranian arms sales and thediversion of profits from the sales to private use and to theContras.   Two fund-raisers and former national security adviser Robert C.McFarlane earlier pleaded guilty to other charges resulting fromWalsh's grand jury investigation.   The charges against Fernandez accused him of helping North andSecord coordinate air drops of weapons and supplies to Contragroups in 1986.   Trials of Poindexter, Secord and Hakim will follow that of North.   On Tuesday, North, Poindexter and Hakim petitioned the U.S.Court of Appeals to have their indictments dismissed because theybelieve testimony given to Congress under grants of immunity wouldbe used against them in the trials.</TEXT></DOC>
