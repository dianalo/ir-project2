 Ironically, until two years ago, Southwestern BellTelephone couldn't schedule in-house education classes swiftly enough on itsnetwork to teach employees how to keep those telephone network connectionshappening.andM;Southwestern Bell, one of the seven regional Bell operating companies formedafter ATandamp;T's 1982 breakup, has its headquarters in Irving, Texas, and servesKansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri and Arkansas.andM;At the company's Advanced Education Center (AEC) in Irving, employees canlearn everything from &quot;[telephone] pole climbing to giving managementpresentations,&quot; said John Tice, VAX system manager for the center.andM;Unfortunately, until July 1987 there was no easy way for the company'semployees to keep informed of all the courses that were being offered.andM;Two years ago, Southwestern Bell decided that it needed to findsoftware-development tools that would allow its programmers to createapplications that facilitate user access to the center's VAX network,according to Tice.andM;Today about 200 Southwestern Bell employees at the Irving facility and 700 atremote locations can access the AEC's VAX network.andM;As a core of the project, AEC chose the Focus fourth-generation language(4GL) and database management system (DBMS) from Information Builders Inc.andO;(IBI) of New York.andP;  Focus is a non-procedural 4GL that runs on IBM mainframesas well as VAXes.andM;Faster than FortranandM;Focus has four basic modules: query and reporting, transaction processing,database and decision support-- which includes graphics, according to A1D'Andrea, marketing manager for IBI's VAX products division.andM;Southwestern Bell uses Focus to create and manage the administration systemfor the education center.andP;  Applications include scheduling in-house courses;maintaining employee training records; handling student messages; and--themost significant use--booking apartment and hotel reservations for thoseattending training classes.andM;Southwestern Bell's AEC operates its VAXcluster on an X.25 network.andP;  A packetdigitizer interfaces with the VAXes and switches packet traffic into the CPU,Tice explained.andM;That packet digitizer is a Network Processor System 375--part of the Series300 family--made by Digital Communications Associates of Aplharetta, Ga.andP;  Thenetwork processor automatically routes user information throughout thenetwork.andP;  The AEC has about 25 PC users.andM;Before Focus, the main language that AEC personnal used for programdevelopment was Fortran.andM;Tice said that the AEC's switch to using 4GL tools is the result of a push bymanagement several years ago to find speedier alternative to Fortran.andP;  &quot;Ittook too long to develop things in Fortran,&quot; he said.andM;Cost was not an overriding factor in management's evaluation of 4GL products,according to Tice.andP;  &quot;Productivity and ease of use&quot; were the major criteria inthe 90-day selection process, which involved testing vendor tools at the AECusing reports of existing data, he said.andM;Tice said the AEC considered four vendor's products before making a finaldecision: Focus from IBI; VAX Rally from DEC; Informix 4GL from InformixSoftware of Menlo Park, Calif.; and PowerHouse from Cognos of Ottawa.andM;The AEC wanted a product that was both a &quot;development tool and a userproductivity tool,&quot; Tice said, and Focus seemed to fit the bill on bothcounts.andM;&quot;PowerHouse is a good development tool, but not a good user tool,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;DEC tools are good user tools, but not good productivity tools.&quot;andP;  As far asInformix is concerned, he said, AEC management did not like that company'sservice and support.andM;Southwestern Bell's AEC spent about $90,000 to $95,000 to acquire Focus 5.2,Tice said.andP;  Included in that cost was software, installation and 36 days oftraining for Focus users at IBI's Dallas facility.andM;Focus was installed in the VAXcluster at Southwestern Bell's education centertwo years ago and &quot;went live&quot; in July 1987, Tice said.andM;Although the AEC purchased a package that includes most of the standard Focusfeatures--such as Dialogue Manager, Talk Technology, Report Writer andModify--AEC officials opted not to buy Focus' Host Language Interface (HLI)and Foccalc spreadsheet function, Tice said.andM;&quot;We didn't see the fit,&quot; Tice said in explaining management's decision not tobuy HLI.andP;  In addition, the AEC was already using the 20/20 spreadsheet fromAccess Technology and didn't need Foccalc, he said.andM;HLI enables programs written in Cobol, Fortran, PL/1 and BAL to access andmaintain Focus databases.andP;  The Foccalc spreadsheet function is integratedwithin Focus.andM;Tice noted that he has two days of credit left on the 36 days of trainingthat IBI included in the Focus purchase price.andM;According to IBI's D'Andrea, IBI charges about $400 a day for Focus trainingat an IBI facility and $1,250 to $1,750 a day for on-site training.andM;&quot;They have a regular curriculum included in the package deal,&quot; Tice said.andO;&quot;We went to their classes.andP;  Their education is very good, as good as [DEC'seducation programs] or better.&quot;andM;Tice noted that although he considers DEC's education &quot;outstanding,&quot;occasionally &quot;you run into an instructor who doesn't know what he's doing,&quot;he said.andP;  &quot;What I appreciate is IBI's instructors are consultants who aretechnically competent,&quot; he said.andM;The AEC also hired an on-site IBI consultant for $70 an hour, who had beencoming in for two to three days a week for the last four months, Tice said.andM;The consultant helped AEC personnel with application development as well asanswered any other questions that might come up, Tice said, adding that theexpenditure was worth it.andP;  The gain in knowledge and expertise &quot;is somethingthat will last a long time,&quot; he said.andM;Productivity Boosted SevenfoldandM;According to IBI officials, Focus users may see up to a tenfold increase inproductivity over what they are able to achieve using third-generationprogramming languages such as Cobol, PL/1 and Fortran.andP;  &quot;As far asproductivity gains,&quot; Tice said, &quot;we see at least seven times [theproductivity].andM;&quot;I'm much more proficient,&quot; Tice said.andP;  &quot;I can put up something [in] two tothree hours that would have taken me a week to do,&quot; he said, adding that suchproductivity improvements only become a reality once a user becomes veryfamiliar with using the 4GLandM;One of the fundamental tasks for which the AEC uses the Focus 4GL is to planand process details of the education sessions at the center, such as keepingtrach of training records, scheduling classes and enrolling students incourses.andM;Toward that end, Southwestern Bell's AEC employees have seen realimprovements in the screen management and data-entry applications that havebeen developed using Focus, Tice said.andM;Southwestern Bell employees &quot;may pull up [a menu on the screen] and see whatclasses are available for the second half of 1989,&quot; he said.andP;  They can alsosee the number of seats available in a particular class and reserve a spacein the class.andM;For example, the Focus application handles training records for coursestaught at two Bell Core research and training facilities, one in Lisle, Ill.,andO;and the other in Cherry Hill, N.J.andP;  Southwestern Bell employees--usingFocus--can call up on their computer screens a list of courses taught at theBell Core facilities and enroll in those courses, Tice explained.andM;The Bell Core training facilities perform research and developmentapplications for each of the seven regional Bell operating companies.andP;  BellCore personnel teach engineering courses, Tice said.andM;Later this year, Tice will begin interfacing the AEC's VAX network atSouthwestern Bell with Bell Core's VAX netowork--which was installed justrecently, he said.andM;The most significant application for Focus users at the AEC is theaprtment-and hotel-reservation system, Tice said.andP;  Using that Focusapplication, hotel rooms can be reserved for students attending AEC or otherBell training classes.andM;Personnel training-class records are rewritten mostly in Fortran, Tice said,and are accessed nightly for the processing and booking of hotel rooms.andO;Fortran applications interact with Focus applications--while also using RMSfiles--to process training-class-scheduling information and reserve rooms forstudents.andM;Another application that has been developed in Focus is student messaging.andO;One Bell student can call another student, for example, and leave a messagewith an operator, who enters the information into a Focus database.andP;  Everysix minutes, messages are automatically transferred to video monitors locatedat strategic points around the training facility.andP;  The monitors informstudents whether or not they have a message.andM;If students see that they have a message, they can call a telephone numberthat accesses a DECtalk or DEcvoice device, which repeats the message.andP;  Oncethe message is repeated, the data is deleted from the Focus database, Ticeexplained.andP;  The data output and entry functions are all done with Focus, hesaid.andM;Network users currently use Focus databases, Fortran and DEC's All-in-1, aswell as the 20/20 spreadsheet, Tice said.andP;  In fact, he noted, a good deal ofthe AEC training system is still written in Fortran with some in Focus.andM;Each of the 900 network users can access applications written either in Focusor Fortran.andP;  &quot;Some applications reside side by side and are controlled by acomputer menu program,&quot; Tice said.andM;All-in-1 is used for office automation purposes, including electronic mail,word processing and time management, Tice said.andP;  In addition, the AEC usesDEC's Record Management System (RMS).andM;Overall, Tice has been pleased with Focus, but he said the product is notwithout its drawbacks.andM;&quot;One complaint I have is that I would want the syntax to be identicalthroughout,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;And it could stand to be a little bit faster,&quot; hesaid, adding that it could be at least twice as fast.andM;&quot;I'm guilty of being an instant-gratification fanatic,&quot; Tice said.andP;  &quot;For me,waiting for anything is frustrating.&quot;andP;  He has no complaints, however, aboutFocus' dependability and data protection, he said.andM;He conceded, however, that not every AEC Fortran user has made a smoothtransition to using Focus.andM;&quot;I've seen people scream and holler while trying to understand what it'sdoing,&quot; he said, noting that some people become frustrated with &quot;letting a[4GL] do its thing the way it does its thing,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;So much is flatgetting used to how the product works.&quot;andM;The VAX system manager said he believes that Focus cannot be classified as&quot;one big product.&quot;andP;  &quot;It's really five or six or seven products hookedtogether,&quot; he said, noting the diversity of Focus applications.andM;Tice argues that there are operational differences between various Focuscommands.andP;  For example, Tice compared the Focus Table function with itsModify function.andM;&quot;You have to learn how to do Table,&quot; Tice said, &quot;and you have to learn how todo Modify.andP;  This does not mean you have to learn just one new language.andP;  Youhave to learn several new languages.&quot;andM;Using Table, Tice continued, &quot;you can just write it any way you wnat.andP;  It's areport generator.andP;  But Modify is very procedural,&quot; more procedural thanTable, he added.andM;Using Table, a user can indicate that a tabular report is desired from, say,the &quot;Sales&quot; file.andP;  Using Modify for a task, such as simultaneous transactionprocessing, provides for an array of facilities--mixing transaction types;the validation and editing of data before data input; and multiple recordprocessing.andP;  In Focus, all transaction-processing applications are donethrough simple English-language statements in the Focus data maintenancelanguage (DML).andM;Next Step: General UsersandM;What's the next step for Focus and Southwestern Bell's AEC network users?andM;&quot;The next step is opening Focus for general-user use,&quot; Tice said, adding thathe plans to continue using Focus for application development.andM;Right now, he said, some of his users have integrated using the 20/20spreadsheet with Focus, he said.andP;  Eventually, he would like to have hisAll-in-1 users access Focus, he said.andM;Although it would be possible to integrate Focus with All-in-1, Tice saidSouthwestern Bell is not rusing into that.andP;  &quot;My users of All-in-1 don't haveaccess to Focus,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;They're not ready to do it.&quot;andM;But eventually they will be ready, Tice said.andP;  The game plan, he said, is togive every network user &quot;generic Focus access.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
