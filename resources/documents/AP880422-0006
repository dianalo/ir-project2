Law.''   Directors, actors, production crew workers and secretaries wereamong thos hit by the Writers Guild of America strike, HerbSteinberg, a spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture andTelevision Producers, said Thursday.   He said about 1,400 employees who work in production areas otherthan writing have been laid off as a result of the seven-week-oldstrike.   The 9,000-member guild went on strike March 7 over issues ofresiduals from movies and television shows distributed in foreigncountries and a producers' proposal to restructure residualpayments for hourlong television shows sold into syndication.   ``We have no way of verifying the information they put out,''said Guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden. ``However, we do questionwhether they have taken into consideration the normal seasonallayoffs that have occurred because of (the television season)hiatus.''   Steinberg said the layoffs and costs tabulated by the producerswere chiefly from 22 regular season television episodes from showssuch as ``L.A. Law'' and ``The Cosby Show,'' which were notproduced because of lack of scripts.   ``This has nothing whatsoever to do with the seasonal layoffs,''said Steinberg. ``It has nothing to do with the hiatus.''   Two federally mediated sessions on April 18 and March 14 endedwithout resumption of negotiations. No new talks are scheduled.   The strike curtailed the seasons of several television shows andcould threaten the start of the fall television season if itcontinues into the summer.   According to statistics gathered by the alliance, a bargainingorganization of more than 200 studios and producers, the strikethus far has cost 1,062 cast and crew members an estimated $12.7million in salaries and benefits.   Some 210 secretaries and other officer staffers have been laidoff as a result of the strike, and lost an estimated $756,000 insalaries. The strike also has affected 207 so-called ``writerhyphenates,'' who have lost fees, salaries and benefits worth anestimated $2.2 million.   A writer hyphenate is generally a writer-producer, someone whois developing a television show or movie. Because they are onstrike as writers, they cannot advance work on scripts or ideas.   Steinberg said the alliance's analysis concludes that 45,000person-days have been lost as a result of the strike.   ``If the Alliance wants to see a speedy end to the strike thebest way to assure that would be to return to the table andcontinue a dialogue that can resolve the outstanding issues,'' Ms.Rhoden said.   Steinberg said the last 20-minute meeting between the new sideshad been requested by the writers, but the union had no new offers.</TEXT></DOC>
