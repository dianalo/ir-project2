Vines was fired by City Manager Jan Hart less than two hoursafter a grand jury indicted him Wednesday. The panel indicted himon one misdemeanor perjury count rather than the seven felonycharges sought by the district attorney.   ``I am surprised and saddened by the precipitous action that hasbeen taken by the Dallas city manager. I plan to fight the minorlegal charge returned by the grand jury,'' Vines said in astatement.   Vines, who was suspended with pay last month, has denied anywrongdoing. If convicted, he could get up to a year in jail and a$2,000 fine.   At a news conference, Ms. Hart said, ``The issue is really one... of public confidence and trust in the leadership of thedepartment.''   Mayor Annette Strauss said she felt sorry for Vines.   ``Our police department is a whole lot stronger, and because ofhis leadership, I believe that we have better ... public safety inour city, and our crime rate really is down,'' she said. ``And Iregret what has happened.''   Vines was indicted over statements he made in August to a panelinvestigating the firing of Officer Patrick LeMaire. Details of thetestimony were not released.   LeMaire was fired in 1989 about two weeks after he killed anunarmed man. He was ordered reinstated in July by an administrativelaw judge who ruled his firing unjustified. He did not rejoin theDallas force.</TEXT></DOC>
