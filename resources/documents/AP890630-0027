HUD Secretary Jack Kemp ordered the troubled program canceledThursday, as the department said the program was ``riddled withabuse.''   Meanwhile, a House Government Operations subcommittee today wasbeginning review of another HUD program _ the mortgage coinsuranceprogram _ in which a recent inspector general's audit found lendershad underwritten $700 million in loans that defaulted by mid-1988.   On Thursday, the subcommittee produced a government memo thatlinks a staffer in George Bush's vice presidential office to aproject involved in alleged influence-peddling at HUD.   The program canceled by Kemp guarantees mortgages to finance landacquisition and site preparation, such as street construction andsewer line installation, for smaller developers who would includehousing for low-income and moderate income families in theirprojects.   Twenty-five of 58 projects financed through the 12-year-old TitleX Land Development Mortgage Insurance Program have defaulted,costing the government $90 million, the department said.   About $500 million in loans were guaranteed since 1977.   ``This program was an absolute disaster,'' said HUD spokesman BobNipp.   Kemp said application fees will be returned for projects thathave not yet been approved. Projects with initial approval or withcommitments for funds will be reviewed ``to determine whether fraudor misrepresentation warrant the denial of government insurance,''he said.   The department will publish a proposed regulation to ``terminatethe program due to the enormity of the losses involved, highpatterns of abuse and the failure of the program to benefit theneedy,'' the department's announcement said.   The Reagan administration sought legislation to abolish theprogram but was unsuccessful. Kemp's proposed regulation must remainopen for a period of public comment before it can become final.   President Bush earlier this week accepted some responsibility forscandals which have surfaced alleging influence-peddling andmismanagement in several HUD programs while he was Ronald Reagan'svice president.   ``If you want to assign blame to the vice president for whathappened over the past ... eight years, OK, that's fine, I acceptit,'' said the president.   The June 1987 memo from Deborah Gore Dean, former executiveassistant to then-Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce, detailed morethan $2 million in funding from HUD to Bayamon, Puerto Rico, duringfiscal years 1986 and 1987.   The memo was sent to Tony Benedi, coordinator of special projectsin the vice president's office, and provided the information ``peryour request.''   A Bayamon project in which Fred Bush _ former deputy chief ofstaff for then-Vice President Bush _ earned $253,000 as a consultanthad been included in an inspector general's audit of HUD's moderaterehabilitation program.   Fred Bush was a key fundraiser for George Bush's 1988presidential campaign but is no relation to the president.   Bush, who also is ambassador-designate to Luxembourg, used hissecond appearance before the panel to make ``clarifying statements''to the testimony he gave on May 25.   Bush had testified he contacted Ms. Dean about a project inBayamon after finding her name in an executive federal telephonedirectory. Several panel members had questioned that account.   But on Thursday Bush said one of his former colleagues remindedhim that Ms. Dean's name was first raised at a social gathering whenthe colleague was talking with another former HUD official, HunterCushing.   ``My colleague's recollection is that Mr. Cushing told him weshould talk to Deborah Gore Dean,'' Bush said.   Bush said he didn't know Dean so he consulted the directory,subsequently called Dean and later met with her at her office todiscuss the project.</TEXT></DOC>
