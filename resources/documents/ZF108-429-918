 The purpose over the past six years has remained the same-toprovide deans and other policy makers with information they can use in makingallocation decisions and program plans with regards to computing.andP;  The readeris cautioned that this survey reflects what the schools report they are doingand is not an endorsement of what they should be doing.andM;The First, Second, and Fourth Surveys gathered information on the hardware,software, and other computer resources of the schools while the Third Surveyaddressed issues of concern to the deans.andP;  Last year's survey focused onbusiness school computerization in terms of process, recognizing that theintroduction and use of technology is ongoing and that the schools may notonly be approaching computerization differently, but also at differentrates.'andM;This survey, the Sixth, returns to the specific focus of hardware, software,and other computer resources, allowing an update on the specifics of thebusiness school computer environment.andP;  However, more emphasis has been givento microcomputer labs and databases, reflecting the increasing development inthese areas.andP;  Additionally, the section dealing with instruction has beenexpanded to include specific information regarding both entrance andgraduation requirements and expectations.andM;For several categories of the data (budget expenditures, staff support, andstudent and faculty microcomputer densities), the data are divided intoquartiles to give a more-detailed picture of the distribution across theschools.andP;  For each quartile, the median value for the variable is reported,rather than the mean, to avoid the skewing problems that occur when there areextremely high or low values in the distribution.andP;  The sample size (N value)varies across many of the tables and figures in this survey because ofmissing data.andP;  Additionally, throughout this survey, where appropriate andavailable, comparable data from the Second (1985), Fourth (1987), and Fifth(1988) Surveys are also included.andP;  However, it should be pointed out thatthese surveys do not comprise a longitudinal study, as the same sample ofschools are not being followed over a period of time.andP;  Rather, the surveysamples comprise the accredited business schools that wish to add their datato the sample.andP;  Comparisons between years are, therefore, somewhat misleadingand should not be used to conduct any trend analyses.andM;PROFILE OF SURVEYED SCHOOLSandM;The population for the Sixth Survey was once again the schools currentlyaccredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)and seven Canadian business schools, which had participated in previoussurveys.andP;  Of the 269 schools available for participation, 163 completed the12-page questionnaire, a 60-percent response rate.andP;  The questionnaires werecompleted primarily by computer center directors (36 percent), facultymembers (26 percent), and assistant deans (21 percent).andM;The schools that participated in this survey are identified in theappendices.andP;  In comparison to the Fourth Survey, the last specificallyfocused on the hardware, software, and computer resources, this survey sampleincreased 27 percent (35 more schools).andP;  Seventy-three percent (93) of the128 business schools in the Fourth Survey also provided data for the SixthSurvey.andP;  [2]andM;Table I displays general demographic information about the 163 schools inthis year's sample together with data from previous survey samples.andP;  For mostof the categories given in Table 1, the data has been consistent over thelast five years.andP;  For example, for 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1989, participationby public versus private schools has remained approximately two-thirds publicand one-third private.andP;  The level of programs, reflected in the type ofdegrees offered, has also stayed about the same.andP;  Similarly, themini/mainframe facilities available at the participating schools has stayedlevel.andP;  Student enrollments, however, continue fluctuating across the timeperiod, yet still maintain a pretty even distribution across the full rangeof school sizes.andM;The schools that have joined the survey this year are a representative crosssection of the study population in terms of type, degrees offered, size,mini/mainframe facilities, microcomputer density, and computer operatingbudget as a percentage of the school's operating budget.andP;  Appendix 1 (notincluded here) presents information on student enrollment, faculty counts,budgets, and staff ratios by school for the 1989 sample.andP;  [3]andM;SUPPORT RESOURCESandM;Computer hardware alone is insufficient for a successful implementation oftechnology-support staff, software, maintenance, and communication links areall necessary components.andP;  In this section we examine the financial and staffsupport allocations of the business schools toward the computerizationeffort.andM;BudgetsandM;Two budget items were requested in this year's questionnaire: the totalannual business school operating budget and the total annual business schoolcomputer operating budget for 1988-89 from all sources.andP;  The computeroperating budget includes staff salaries, benefits and support, equipmentmaintenance and services, software and data acquisition and licenses,supplies, operating overhead, and computer recharge funds.andP;  It does notinclude major capital acquisitions, microcomputer purchases, and facultysalaries.andP;  One hundred twenty-three (76 percent) of the schools reportedtheir total school budget; 126 (77 percent) reported their computeroperations budget; and 110 (68 percent) reported both.andP;  Several schools notedsome changes in the inclusions or exclusions.andP;  Some of the schools notanswering this question indicated that the data was confidential, notavailable at this time, unknown, or controlled by the university and not thebusiness school.andM;For the 123 schools providing data, the total annual business schooloperating budgets ranged from $51,800 to $84,100,000, with a median of$5,100,000.andP;  The total annual business school computer operating budgets forthe 126 schools providing data ranged from $2,000 to $4,500,000, with amedian of $150,000.andP;  For the 110 business schools providing data for bothbudgets, on the average, the computer operating budget was approximately 3.8percent of the total school budget, up from 3.3 percent in the Fourth Survey(1987) and 3.0 percent in the Second Survey (1985).andP;  Thus, this year's sampleexhibits a slight increase in the overall financial commitment to computersupport.andM;Figure 1 shows the computer operating budget as allocated into support forundergraduate, MBA, research, and administrative computing requirements forthe 126 (74 percent) schools providing data.andP;  The undergraduate and MBAallocations were similar in aggregated percentages of the total computeroperating budget.andM;To provide another basis of comparison of the budgetary data across thebusiness schools, the annual computing operating budget was converted into aper student statistic by dividing the total student FTE by the reportedcomputer operating budget.andP;  For the 125 schools providing data, the medianquartile expenditures per student were $484, $117, $40, and $14,respectively, as shown in Figure 2.andM;One hundred forty-three (88 percent) of the schools provided data regardingtheir sources of funding for operations and maintenance, hardwareacquisition, and software acquisition.andP;  Table 11 summarizes this data,showing the percentage of schools indicating that at least 50 percent offunding came from a particular source.andP;  Eighty-one percent of the schools inthis year's sample indicated that they were responsible for at least half oftheir operational budgets, a large increase over the 64 percent reported bythe Fourth Survey (1987) sample.andP;  Private contributions have decreased as theprimary source of funding for operation and maintenance although the schoolsdepending on funding from student charges remained about the same.andP;  Thisyear, the sources of funding for hardware and software acquisition wereseparated, making comparison with the data from the 1987 survey difficult.andO;For hardware and software acquisition, student charges have increasedslightly as the primary source of funding.andP;  Vendor donations are now shown tobe mainly for hardware rather than for software acquisition.andM;Student charges for computer usage were clearly not a primary source offunding for many of the business schools.andP;  One hundred six (71 percent) ofthe undergraduate schools indicated that no computer-usage charges werecharged for their program, and 108 (69 percent) of the graduate schoolsindicated that no computer-usage charges were charged for the MBA program.andO;However, the data from the schools that did delineate their charge structuresare presented in Table III.andP;  The computer-usage charges are quite similar forthe undergraduate and the MBA programs.andP;  Charges other than thosespecifically listed in the table included per course charges for computermajors only, a one-time charge for a mandatory introductory computer course,charges per course credit, charges per semester, and hourly charges.andP;  Eleven(7 percent) of the business schools indicated that faculty were charged formini/mainframe or microcomputer usage, other than university-providedcharge-back funds.andM;Computing StaffandM;An extremely important dimension of a business school's computing environmentis its support staff.andP;  One hundred thirty-one (80 percent) of the schoolsindicated that they had their own computing support staff, autonomous fromother campus facilities and supported out of the business school computeroperating budget.andP;  The total number of staff ranged from 0.25 to 47.5 FTE.andO;By category, the staffs ranged from 0.1 to 21 FTE for technical, hardware,and network staff-, from 0.1 to 21.75 FTE for academic user support staff-,from 0.25 to 12.75 FTE for administrative user support staff; and from 0.25to 11 FTE for computer facilities management staff.andM;Table IV details the business schools' staff allocations among fourcategories: technical (hardware and network), academic user support,administrative user support, and computer facilities management.andP;  Based onquartile medians, schools in all quartiles appear to employ approximatelytwice as many academic user support personnel as technical staff.andO;Administrative support levels seem to match computing-service managementlevels.andM;To provide further comparison of the computing support staff across thebusiness schools, the ratio of student FTE to total staff FTE was calculated.andO;Figure 3 displays this ratio by quartile for the 131 responding schools, themedian ratios for each quartile being 98, 260, 592, and 1,993, respectively.andO;Compared with the previous year's data, computing staff support has decreasedin all of the quartiles.andP;  In the fourth quartile, for example, each staffmember now supports 1,993 students, as compared to 1,820 students in the 1985data.andP;  The disparity in student computing support between the first andfourth quartiles remains dramatic.andM;MINI/MAINFRAME COMPUTER SYSTEMSandM;One hundred fifty-six (96 percent) of the business schools indicated thattheir users had access to mini/ mainframe systems.andP;  Ten of these schoolsindicated that they used only their own mini/mainframe systems; fifty schoolsaccessed both their own and university-wide systems; and the remaining 96schools relied exclusively on access to the university-wide systems.andO;Appendix 2 (not included here) provides detailed information on the make andmodels of the mini/mainframes available as reported by each school.andM;The 61 business schools (37 percent) that maintained their own mini/mainframesystems listed 122 separate computers.andP;  Table V displays the make, model, andnumber of these systems supported by at least three or more of the schools.andO;Although 16 different vendors were represented, Digital Equipment Corporationhad the largest number of systems installed, with 42 (34 percent) of thetotal 122.andP;  The VAX 11/7xx was shown to be the most-installed system (18),followed closely by the IBM 4300s (17), the Digital MicroVaxs (16), the ATandamp;T3Bxs (15), and the Hewlett Packard HP3000s (12).andM;Data provided by 35 of these business schools that maintained their ownmini/mainframes indicated several distinct patterns of usage, as shown inTable VI.andP;  Twenty-five of the mini/mainframes were used only for a singlepurpose, either for coursework (12 schools), for research (8 schools), or foradministration activities (5 schools).andP;  In contrast, 17 of these largersystems were shared in all three categories of use.andP;  The combination ofresearch and administration use was the least popular.andP;  Twenty-seven businessschools indicated they had plans for acquiring a new mini/mainframe system,usually within a one-year time frame.andM;MICROCOMPUTERSandM;The most significant area of computer growth in recent years has been in theintroduction of microcomputers.andP;  Ninety-nine percent of the schools in this1989 survey provided microcomputer data.andP;  The total number of microcomputersat these business schools ranged from 11 to 793, with quartile median valuesof 54, 114, 194, and 314.andM;Models and Market PenetrationandM;Table VII displays the variety of microcomputers reported by the schoolsowning four or more of the same systems.andP;  In total, at least 31 differentmicrocomputer manufacturers were represented, along with 48 differentmicrocomputer models.andP;  Eighty-six percent of the schools again reportedhaving four or more IBM PCs or PC/XTs, 49 percent IBM PS/2s, 35 percentMacintosh Pluses or SEs, 34 percent IBM PC/ATS, and 29 percent Zeniths orZenith 150S.andP;  All of the other models were reported by less than 20 percentof the schools.andM;In general, the number of leading vendors has remained about the same, yetthe diversity of separate models supported by the business schools hasgreatly increased.andP;  Table VIII documents this change.andP;  For example, in 1987,about 50 percent of the respondent schools were supporting one or twodifferent microcomputer models, yet in 1989, only 7 percent of the schoolssupported one or two models.andP;  In other words, 93 percent of the schools arenow supporting at least three models, in many cases extending across two orthree generations of microprocessor chips.andP;  For example, a single-vendorschool may have IBM PCs with 8086 chips, PC/ATs with 80286 chips, and PS/2swith 80386 chips.andM;One hundred sixty-one schools reported owning a total of 30,740microcomputers.andP;  Table IX details these microcomputers for the models forwhich at least 300 systems were reported.andP;  The total number of systemscontinues to grow, but at a much slower rate, 13 percent over the past yearin contrast to 62 percent and 75 percent between 1987-1988 and 1985-1987,respectively.andP;  The rate of growth in the average number of systems perschool, however, has increased slightly, 23 percent compared to 18 percentbetween 1987 and 1988.andP;  The early IBM PC and PC/XT together with the XTclones remain dominant, representing 39 percent of the microcomputer systemswhile the other contending models, except for Zenith, are very close togetherat just under 10 percent.andM;Microcomputer DensitiesandM;Two ratios were calculated to provide further understanding of thepenetration of microcomputers into the business school computer environment.andO;The first, a student-per-microcomputer ratio, was calculated by dividing thetotal student FTE by the number of the school's microcomputers available forstudent use.andP;  This density measure reflects the number of students who shareaccess to a single microcomputer.andP;  For example, a student microcomputerdensity of 28 is interpreted as 28 students sharing access to themicrocomputer system.andP;  The second ratio, faculty-per-micro, was calculated bydividing the faculty FTE by the number of the school's microcomputersavailable exclusively for faculty use.andP;  As these ratios do not take intoconsideration any microcomputer systems that might be owned by the studentsor the faculty, the ratio denominators are probably understated.andP;  Thus, theactual number of students or faculty who share access to microcomputersystems is probably lower (i.e., better) than reported.andM;Of the 154 schools who provided the necessary data, the medianstudent-per-micro density, by quartiles, are 10, 22, 36, and 65,respectively, as shown in Figure 4.andP;  Of the 158 business schools providingthe necessary data, the median faculty-per-micro densities are 0.8, 1.1, 1.5,and 2.6, as shown in Figure 5.andP;  These figures reflect the continuing, butslowing, growth of microcomputers into the business school computerenvironment.andM;Acquisition and OwnershipandM;All of the business schools offering graduate programs provided dataregarding their requirements for MBAs to purchase their own microcomputersfor the 1988-89 academic year.andP;  Eighty-two percent (130) responded that MBAswere not required to purchase a microcomputer.andP;  Four percent (6) of theschools indicated that purchase was required for some students, usually forthe Executive MBA programs.andP;  The remaining fourteen percent responded eitherthat purchase was not required but recommended or that required purchase wasbeing planned for the coming year.andP;  The makes specified in these instanceswere IBM or a compatible, Macintosh, or a Zenith portable system.andM;MaintenanceandM;One hundred fifty-four (95 percent) responded to the school-ownedmicrocomputer maintenance question.andP;  Only three of these schools respondedthat they had no maintenance program or that they had not dealt with thisissue yet.andP;  Several schools employed more than one of the maintenance optionsprovided.andP;  Seventy-eight (51 percent) of the schools responded that they usedtheir own staff for maintenance, 49 (32 percent) contract with outsidevendors, and 91 (59 percent) contract with university services.andP;  Fifteen (10percent) of the schools provided other responses to the maintenance question,usually indicating that maintenance was provided by the university asrequired without formal contract arrangements or that the equipment wasreturned to the vendor directly.andP;  With regard to maintenance and support offaculty-owned microcomputers, 57 of the total 163 responding schools (35percent) indicated that their business school provided the maintenancewhereas 100 (62 percent) did not.andP;  Five schools provided support forfaculty-owned software.andM;Portable SystemsandM;Portable microcomputer systems are considered to be an area of potentialgrowth and expansion.andP;  This year's data showed that the average number ofportables per school doubled, from 17.2 in 1988 to 34.8 as reported for 1989.andO;Tables X and XI present different aspects of the portable system data.andP;  TableX presents information on the portable systems installed by the schools byvendor.andP;  Zenith systems increased slightly, now being available in 47 percentof the schools, whereas both Compaq and IBM decreased slightly.andP;  Toshiba,Hewlett-Packard, and NEC stayed about the same.andM;Table XI presents the portable microcomputer systems by total numbers.andO;Exactly the same number of schools reported having portable systems, yetthere was a growth in overall percentages due to differences in the samplesizes between 1988 and 1989.andP;  Eighty-three percent of the business schools inthis 1989 survey reported having portable microcomputers, up from 77 percentin the Fifth Survey (1988).andP;  Although data was collected by model, in TableXI the models were aggregated by vendor to summarize the data, due to theever growing number of different models available.andP;  HewlettPackard clearlydominates with 69 percent of the systems.andP;  Zenith has taken over the secondposition with 11 percent of the systems.andP;  IBM has dropped considerably inthis past year, from 19 percent to now only 5 percent.andM;High-Performance 32-bit Graphic WorkstationsandM;Another area of potential growth has been the 32-bit high-performancegraphics workstation.andP;  These systems filled a perceived void between themicrocomputer and the mini/mainframe computer.andP;  However, with the emergenceof the high-performance microcomputers (e.g., IBM PS/2 Model 80 or AppleMacintosh IIcx), the distinction between workstations and microcomputers isbecoming a gray area.andP;  Table XII presents the information on workstationsfound in this year's sample of schools, ranked by the percentage of schoolswith a particular model.andP;  The table shows that there has been only a slightincrease in the number of schools acquiring workstations although the actualnumber of workstations has more than doubled.andP;  Sun Systems are still found inmost of the schools while Vaxstations are the most abundant, accounting for49 percent of the reported systems.andM;COMPUTER LABSandM;Data on computer labs was provided by 157 (96 percent) of the businessschools.andP;  Four hundred ninety separate computer labs were identified,accounting for 12,450 microcomputers, an average of 25.4 microcomputers percomputer lab.andP;  Appendix 3 (not included here) details the computer labenvironment for the 468 labs reported that had four or more microcomputersystems.andM;The 12,450 microcomputers in the labs comprise 40 percent of the totalmicrocomputers reported in this study.andP;  Twenty-two percent of the schoolsreported having one computer lab, and an additional 23 percent reported twolabs.andP;  Eighteen percent and 16 percent have three and four labs,respectively, and 20 percent of the schools have five, six, or seven computerlabs.andP;  One school reported 10 labs (California State University, Fresno), andone school reported 12 labs (University of Arizona).andP;  Fifty percent of thelabs are used for regular classroom instruction, and 59 percent of the labshave a consultant available at least two-thirds of the open hours.andP;  Eightpercent of the labs were reported as dedicated for faculty use only.andM;The labs show extensive communication capabilities, with 50 percent havingthe microcomputers networked and 48 percent having the microcomputers linkedto a host mini/mainframe system.andP;  Every lab reported having at least one typeof output device, with dot-matrix printers being reported most often, 52percent.andP;  Twenty-one percent of the schools reported a laser printer inaddition to the dot-matrix, and another 11 percent reported a plotter aswell.andP;  Only 7 percent of the schools reported laser printers as the onlyoutput device.andM;COMMUNICATIONSandM;Connectivity between microcomputers continues to increase in the businessschools.andP;  In 1989, 80 percent of the schools provided details of local areanetwork software, compared to 66 percent for 1987 and 39 percent for 1985.andM;Microcomputer CommunicationsandM;Network data provided by 130 of the business schools for 25,468microcomputers showed that 45 percent (11,390) of the microcomputers arestand alones, not linked to any other computer systems.andP;  Eighteen percent(4,487) are linked to a host only; 10 percent (2,497) are linked to othermicrocomputers; and 28 percent (7,094) are linked to both a host and othermicrocomputers.andP;  Figure 6 displays these data summarized by percentage ofmicrocomputers with connectivity for the 130 schools providing responses tothis question.andP;  In this aggregate form, very little change was seen in theamount of microcomputer networking even though the schools making up the datawere not the same.andP;  The schools with greater than two-thirds of theirmicrocomputers networked increased slightly whereas those schools withbetween one-third and two-thirds of their microcomputers networked decreasedby about the same amount.andP;  The other categories stayed exactly the same.andP;  The&quot;none&quot; category may be somewhat misleading, as the schools which did notprovide data were not added into that category, even though it is likely thata great many of them did not provide any connectivity between their micros.andM;Local Area NetworksandM;Information regarding the specific hardware and software approach used intheir local area networks was provided by 131 business schools.andP;  The LANsmentioned at least three times and the percentage of the individual networksalso linked to a host mini/mainframe system are listed in Table XIII.andM;With regard to the LAN systems being connected to a host mini/mainframe, theDecnet, the Ungermann Bass, and the Ethernet schools all show more than 80percent connectivity of their systems to a host.andP;  Of the 144 business schoolsthat provided data regarding a data switch, port selector, or PABX, 51percent (73 schools) responded that they provide this type of access tomini/mainframes, with Micom being identified thirteen times, ATandamp;T seven,Gandolf and Rolm each six, and IBM four.andP;  Of the 131 business schools thatreported LAN software, 58 (44 percent) listed only one LAN software, 33 (25percent) listed two different LAN software systems, 19 (15 percent) listedthree, 14 (11 percent) listed four, and 7 (5 percent) listed five or more.andM;Network ApplicationsandM;The distinction between local and wide area networks has become increasinglyblurred as the software that bridges between the applications has become moretransparent to the user.andP;  Table XIV summarizes the more common local area andwide area network applications by user group, ranked in order of averagepercent usage.andP;  Compared to data from the 1987 survey, electronic mailremained the most common network application.andP;  Five categories in thisquestion (MCI Mail, online calendaring, print server, software distribution,and The Source) were indicated by less than one percent within all usergroups.andP;  In all instances, the faculty-user group shows a higher percent ofusage than any of the other user groups.andM;SOFTWAREandM;The participating business schools listed the principal software packages forfifteen different categories separately by mini/mainframe and microcomputerusage as well as by instruction and research usage.andP;  Table XV summarizes thesoftware usage as reported by the schools for each of these categories.andP;  Thistable is sorted by number of schools reporting microcomputer softwarepackages and emphasizes the variety of packages in each category.andP;  Forexample, the first line shows that for spreadsheets 12 business schoolslisted software packages for mini/mainframes and 156 schools listed softwarepackages for microcomputers.andP;  Within the mini/mainframe category, 7 packageswere identified as used for instruction and for research.andP;  Within themicrocomputer category, 17 different packages were identified forinstructional usage, whereas 16 were listed as being used for research.andM;This summary table allows some interesting insights into the use of computersin the business schools.andP;  Five categories of software applications(communications, statistical packages, programming languages, modeling andoptimization, and simulation) appear to be used about evenly on both themini/mainframe and microcomputer systems although there is slightly moreusage of statistical packages on the larger systems and communications on thesmaller systems.andP;  The other ten categories of software applications are usedpredominantly on microcomputers.andP;  Among these, the most popular arespreadsheets, word processing, and database management systems.andM;Several applications show a considerable number of different softwarepackages.andP;  Within the mini/mainframe category, there were 32 and 34 differentsoftware packages listed for database management systems.andP;  Formicrocomputers, more than 30 different software packages were listed in fiveareas.andP;  In the graphics category, 60 packages were for instructional use, and56 were for research use.andP;  For business games, a wide variety of packages,52, were given for instructional use.andP;  Communications, statistics, andmodeling and optimization were the other applications with more than 30different software packages identified.andP;  The diversity of software packageswithin the microcomputer domain tends to substantiate the popularity ofmicrocomputer usage over the mini/mainframes in the business schoolenvironment.andM;Detailed tables are given for the software applications in the sections whichfollow.andP;  It should be noted that for these tables a differing number ofschools is shown, since some schools did not report software for thatcategory.andP;  The count after a particular software package name reflects thenumber of times that packages was reported by five or more schools.andP;  &quot;Other&quot;reflects the number of software packages reported by less than five schools.andM;An interesting note is that in both the 1985 and 1987 surveys, the softwarepackages used in three or more schools could be presented in one table.andP;  Thisyear, the criteria was increased to five or more schools.andP;  Since the list wasso extensive, separate tables were required for each category.andM;Artificial Intelligence, Expert SystemsandM;This software application area, detailed for the first time in this survey,is summarized in Table XVI and shows that more software packages arespecified for microcomputers than for mini/mainframe systems.andP;  LISP was theonly package identified by five or more schools for the mini/mainframes.andO;Prolog, Exsys, Guru, LISP, and VP-Expert are listed most commonly formicrocomputers, with VP-Expert especially strong for instructional use.andM;Business GamesandM;As in the 1987 survey results, this type of application software remainsstronger for instructional usage than for research, with Markstrat continuingto be the most popular package.andP;  However, as shown in Table XVII, the highnumber of different packages for microcomputers, 52, reflects the integrationof business games into the curriculum.andM;CommunicationsandM;Communications software is another new application area detailed for thefirst time in this survey.andP;  Table XVIII shows a very high response rate amongthe schools in both computing environments.andP;  KERMIT is the most commonly usedcommunications package although there are a large number of other packageslisted.andM;This application category shows a significant variety in the number ofsoftware packages being used.andP;  For example, for microcomputers, 39 differentpackages were identified by 126 schools for research support, but only 4packages were listed by five or more schools.andP;  Thus, 35 different packageswere being supported by four or fewer schools.andM;Database Management SystemsandM;Database management systems software is one of the top-three microcomputerapplications identified in Table XV.andP;  As shown in Table XIX, 148 businessschools listed microcomputer database software; about twice as many reportedthis software for mini/mainframes.andM;The most dominant microcomputer package was dBase, with R:BASE the clearsecond choice, followed by a variety of other packages.andP;  For themini/mainframe systems, a large variety of packages were identified withOracle, SQL, and INGRES, mentioned about the same number of times.andM;Desktop PublishingandM;Detailed information regarding the software packages used for desktoppublishing was another of the new application categories.andP;  As may be seen inTable XX, desktop publishing is primarily a microcomputer application, withfour times as many schools responding with software listings for themicrocomputers as for the mini/mainframes.andP;  The most popular package for themicrocomputers is PageMaker, followed by Ventura and TEX, which also appearsin the mini/mainframe category.andM;Development ToolsandM;Development or CASE (Computer-aided software engineering) tools are becomingan important part of the instructional environment for system analysis anddesign courses.andP;  Excelerator was listed by 62 of the 75 schools identifyingmicrocomputer-based CASE software.andM;Graphics and Presentation SoftwareandM;Graphics application software, detailed in Table XXI, is dominated by usageon microcomputers with almost three times as many schools listing softwarefor the mini/mainframe systems.andP;  This application showed the greatest varietyof different microcomputer packages with Harvard Graphics the most common.andO;SAS Graph is the dominant graphics package for mini/mainframes.andM;Integrated PackagesandM;Integrated packages combine spreadsheet, word processing, database, graphics,and communication capabilities under one common interface.andP;  This categoryapplies to microcomputers only, and 51 schools reported using these systems.andO;There was no clear leader with Framework, Symphony, Works, and Enable alllisted about 10 times each.andP;  Even though integrated packages were onceperceived as a potential replacement for the various separate applicationpackages, this has not happened, and in fact, there has been a 13-percentdecrease in the number of schools listing this application between 1987 and1989.andM;Modeling and OptimizationandM;Lindo and IFPS continue to dominate this application software for both themini/mainframe and microcomputer systems.andP;  This is one of the computerapplications showing about the same amount of usage in both environmentsalthough the microcomputer environment shows a greater number of differentsoftware packages, 38 and 29, versus 26 and 27 for the mini/mainframes, aspresented in Table XXII.andM;Programming LanguagesandM;Once the only software, programming languages now share the domain, beinglisted sixth in Table XV.andP;  As shown in Table XXIII, BASIC is the preferredprogramming language for the microcomputer environment while COBOL is thepreferred language for instructional purposes; and FORTRAN is preferred forresearch in the mini/mainframes environment.andM;Project ManagementandM;Details on project management software are another of the application areasfirst appearing as separate categories in this year's survey, and again, likeseveral of the others appearing for the first time, it is a microcomputerdominated application.andP;  Harvard Project Management was mentioned by 16schools, Mac Project by 11, and Time Line by 5.andM;SimulationandM;Simulation is another application that is now used about the same in bothcomputing environments, a change from the 1987 report when this applicationwas primarily a mini/mainframe application.andP;  As presented in Table XXIV, GPSSdominates overall.andM;Spreadsheet PackagesandM;As indicated in Table XXV, 156 schools are using 17 different spreadsheetpackages with Lotus 1-2-3 continuing to dominate, being specified by abouttwo-thirds of the schools.andP;  All of the other microcomputer software packageslisted, except for SuperCalc, appear for the first time this year, with Excelmaking an especially prominent showing.andP;  In the mini/mainframe category,20/20 was the only package to meet the criteria for inclusion in the table.andM;Statistical PackagesandM;Statistical software is an area in which mini/mainframes still dominate, butmicrocomputer versions are becoming more prevelant.andP;  Interestingly, as shownin Table XXVI, the major mini/mainframe packages appear to have beensuccessfully migrated to the microcomputer environment, with SAS and SPSSdominating across both environments.andM;Word ProcessingandM;Word processing is the single most prevalent software application.andP;  As shownin Table XXVII, 155 business schools listed 29 different microcomputerword-processing packages.andP;  WordPerfect has remained the dominant package,reported by about two-thirds of the schools.andP;  MS Word was reported by morebusiness schools than WordStar, reversing the positions held in the 1987survey data.andM;Other Software PackagesandM;Software packages listed in the &quot;other&quot; category of applications includedgeneral decision support systems, group decision support systems andconferencing software, accounting application software, CAD, bibliographicand text analysis, and utility and virus protection software.andP;  Although someof these categories of application software are situation specific, some maybecome presented as detailed listings as they are integrated into the generalbusiness school computing environment.andM;INSTRUCTIONandM;Instructional-oriented questions were expanded this year to includecomputer-literacy entrance and graduation requirements/expectations and themix of mini/ mainframe and microcomputer usage in addition to the continuingquestions regarding hands-on computer use in core courses, sources ofcourseware, classroom electronic equipment, and computer-related training.andM;Entrance and Graduation Requirements/ExpectationsandM;This year's survey requested rather extensive information regarding bothcomputer-literacy entrance and graduation requirements and/or expectationsseparately for the undergraduate and MBA programs.andP;  Of the 149 businessschools supporting undergraduate business programs, 81 percent (120) statedthat there were no computer-literacy entrance requirements for theirstudents.andP;  Fifteen percent (22) of the business schools had requirements.andO;Fourteen schools required a computer course while several schools specifiedthat some training was necessary.andP;  Others required a hands-on exam, basicfamiliarity and understanding of microcomputers or a knowledge of DOS,problem solving, and keyboard skills.andM;For the 157 schools with MBA programs, 66 percent (104) stated that therewere no computer-literacy entrance requirements.andP;  Twenty-nine percent (46) ofthe graduate business schools specified requirements including computerconcepts, MIS, applications courses (19 schools), general computer literacy(word processing, spreadsheets, and database management systems) orfamiliarity and experience (17 schools).andP;  Five of the graduate level schoolsstated that they required computer-proficiency hands-on exams, usingmicrocomputer applications software.andP;  Several others mentioned workshops ornon-credit remedial courses.andM;Table XXVIII summarizes the computer requirements and/or expectations upongraduation from business school for both the undergraduate and the MBAprograms.andP;  The requirements are interesting in that although the order ofimportance of the requirements (as suggested by the percentage rankings) arethe same in all cases but one (the computer entrance exam), a larger percentof the undergraduate schools than the MBA schools specify requirements.andP;  Theemphasis on microcomputer systems in the business school environment is againseen in the requirement of mini/mainframe use by only 50 percent of theundergraduate programs and by only 38 percent in the MBA programs.andM;In several instances, other requirements were specified, includingapplications introductory and statistical package courses.andP;  Additionally, 61undergraduate schools and 29 MBA program schools required programminglanguages.andP;  BASIC was the required language for 67 percent of theundergraduate schools and 62 percent of the graduate program schools,followed by Pascal (15 percent and 3 percent), COBOL (12 percent and 7percent), and FORTRAN (2 percent), of the undergraduate and graduate programsrespectively.andM;Microcomputer/Mainframe Usage MixandM;In order to better understand the role of mini/mainframes, this year's surveyincluded questions concerning student usage of both microcomputer and mini/mainframe systems at the undergraduate and graduate level.andP;  For theundergraduate programs, 145 of the 149 schools provided data and indicatedthat on the average 80 percent of their student computing was done onmicrocomputers and 20 percent on mini/mainframes.andP;  For the MBA programs, allthe schools provided data and indicated that on the average 83 percent oftheir student computing was done on microcomputers and 17 percent onmini/mainframes.andP;  With regard to the appropriateness of this microcomputerand mini/mainframe usage mix, both the undergraduate and the graduate schoolsresponded, on the average, that this usage mix was &quot;about right.&quot; Only 5percent of the undergraduate and 7 percent of the graduate schools respondedin the extreme (indicating that there was too much emphasis onmicrocomputers) whereas none of the schools responded in the other extreme oftoo much emphasis on mini/mainframe usage.andP;  In general, it appears that thereis only a slight concern regarding a possible overemphasis on microcomputerusage at the expense of the larger systems.andM;Penetration into the CurriculumandM;The business schools indicated whether hands-on use of computing was requiredin their undergraduate and graduate core courses, using the coursedescriptions as given by AACSB.andP;  Data was gathered on whether requiredcomputer use occurred in none, some, or all of the sections.andP;  Figure 7summarizes the responses for the undergraduate core courses and Figure 8 forthe graduate core courses.andM;To see an aggregate growth of required computer usage across the curriculum,the data for Figures 7 and 8 were compared with that from both 1987 and 1985and is shown in Table XXIX.andP;  The net change for each academic area betweenthe 1989 and the 1987 data was calculated and then averaged into anundergraduate and graduate total for each of the years.andP;  Table XXIX shows aslow, but continuing, increase of computer usage for both business programs,about 5 percent for the undergraduate programs and 6.6 percent for thegraduate.andP;  As can be seen in the table, the largest overall increasesoccurred in Economics and Business Policy at the undergraduate level andEconomics and Marketing at the graduate level.andM;Sources of CoursewareandM;For core courses for which a school indicated that there was at least somerequired computer use, the source of the courseware was requested.andO;Courseware was either developed internally, acquired with the textbook,acquired from commercial sources, or acquired from another university.andP;  Manyschools indicated multiple sources for a particular course, and some listedcommercial packages such as Lotus 1-2-3 as the courseware.andP;  Tables XXX andXXXI summarize these data separately for the undergraduate and graduate corecourses.andP;  The N values in the tables are the number of schools that indicatedat least some required computer use.andP;  The source percent values across eachline are the percent of schools in each cell based on that N.andM;Both tables indicate that commercial software packages are currently thedominant source of courseware; although when compared to the 1987 data, thegraduate level course shows a 14-percent increase (64 percent to 78 percent)whereas the undergraduate shows only about a 7 percent increase (from 68percent to 75 percent).andP;  Major increases were also seen in the amount ofcourseware acquired with textbooks, 21 percent (28 percent to 49 percent) forthe undergraduate level courseware and 20 percent (19 percent to 39 percent)for the graduate level.andP;  The internally developed and acquisitions from otheruniversity percentages remained about the same as the 1987 data.andM;Classroom Electronic EquipmentandM;There was an increase of 7 percent (83 percent of the business schools in the1987 survey to 90 percent in this survey) in classrooms that are now equippedto display interactive computer output, either from terminals ormicrocomputers.andP;  Of the 146 schools indicating the use of interactivecomputer output display technology, 87 schools (60 percent) had permanentlyinstalled equipment; 68 schools (47 percent) in less than 25 percent of theclassrooms; 10 schools (7 percent) in 25 percent to 50 percent of theclassrooms; and 9 schools (6 percent) in more than 50 percent of theirclassrooms.andP;  Again, a heavy dependency was shown on mobile units that couldbe wheeled between classrooms.andP;  Ninety-three percent (135 schools) reportedusing these, with 28 schools reporting one mobile unit, 40 schools two, 20schools three, 14 schools four, and 21 schools five or more.andP;  Most of theseunits were either delivered to the classroom by staff or picked up andreturned by the faculty.andP;  Several of the business schools mentioned that theunits were assigned or stored in the classroom or were the responsibility ofthe central audio-visual department of the university.andM;The video projectors that were specifically mentioned included Sony (80 in 43schools), Electrohome (35 in 18 schools), Barco (30 in 11 schools), and Sharp(8 in 3 schools).andP;  The video monitors that were specifically mentionedincluded Sony with 27 in 13 schools, Zenith with 14 in 8 schools, and NECwith 14 in 5 schools.andP;  Datashow was the most often specified LCD device usedwith the overhead projectors with 119 in 72 schools, followed by Sharp with54 in 27 schools, Magnabyte with 17 in 9 schools, and PC Viewer with 14 in 8schools.andM;TrainingandM;Figure 9 displays the type of computer-related training for students for1985, 1987, and 1989.andP;  In this table, the relative position of the types oftraining have remained the same except for in university-provided workshops,which showed a large increase to become more popular than business schooltraining during the academic year.andM;The respondents were also asked to identify the different types ofcomputer-related training provided to their students, faculty, and staff, aswell as to indicate the effectiveness of the training program.andP;  Table XXXIIdisplays the data relating to seven different training approaches by usergroup.andP;  (The category &quot;business school provided one-to-one&quot; was inadvertentlyomitted from the questionnaire.) Classroom instruction is shown to be thedominant form of training for students, followed by handouts/documentationand university-provided workshops.andP;  Documentation is the primary approachused for faculty and university-provided workshops for staff.andP;  The tableshows that business school workshops prior to the beginning of classes werereported to be the most effective approach for MBA students (3.3) while theuniversity-provided workshops, even though most common, are perceived to beamong the least effective of the approaches (2.3).andM;DATABASES AVAILABLE FOR INSTRUCTION AND RESEARCHandM;Information regarding databases, which are available for research andinstruction for at least 10 percent of the 163 business schools in thissurvey, is summarized in Table XXXIII, ordered by percent of availability.andM;Compustat again remains the most widely used database and is available in 74percent (121) of the schools.andP;  Twenty-eight percent (45) of the schoolsreported storing the Compustat database online; 48 percent (78) schools usedtape storage; and 17 percent (27) schools reported now having Compustatavailable on CD-ROM.andP;  Some schools indicated that Compustat was available onall three storage media.andP;  Terminal dial-up appears to be the most commonaccess method, reported by 36 percent (58) of the schools.andP;  Faculty are shownto be the primary users.andP;  Continuing across Table XXXIII, Compustat users arereported to be given &quot;some support&quot; by the schools, on average, and only 9percent of the schools have an access charge for using the database.andO;Although usage changes by database for user group, averaging across all ofthe databases, the faculty were shown to be the primary users (29 percent),followed by the MBA students (16 percent) and the PhD students (14 percent).andO;ABI Inform showed the highest level of support at 3.9.andM;ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMSandM;Table XXXIV presents the computer-related administrative systems supported ordeveloped by the business schools, ordered by percent of staff usage.andP;  Notethat even though word processing is not a true administrative system, it isthe most commonly occurring computer-related activity among business schoolstaffs, reported by 62 percent of the schools in this survey.andM;For many of the administrative activities, end-user micro-based systems werereported more commonly than business school mini/mainframe orcampus-supported systems, especially for budget preparation, faculty records,and faculty course assignment systems.andP;  The respondents indicated that mostof these systems were developed in Lotus or dbase.andP;  The single most commonuse of business school mini/mainframes was electronic mail systems, whichalso has the largest number of primary users other than word processing.andM;The table suggests that there are relatively few databases shared between thesystems, with the possible exception of student records, admissions, andregistration and enrollment, reported by approximately 22 percent of theschools.andP;  Very few schools listed commercial mini/mainframe administrativesystem software, rather that most systems were developed in-house.andM;CONCLUSIONS AND OPEN QUESTIONSandM;Once again the survey has provided data and information regarding what ishappening in our business schools, but serious questions still remain.andM;Perhaps an important question is one of cost benefit.andP;  Has the tremendousinvestment, both human and capital, been worth it? To answer this questionrequires that some set of goals be identified against which the benefits canbe measured.andP;  However, it is not clear that schools have established thesegoals, other than that of curriculum integration (which in and of itself isunclear).andM;We can also ask whether the massive introduction of microcomputer technologyhas made any difference.andP;  Have our institutions produced better students andhigher-quality research? It may well be that the computer is simply thetypewriter and calculator of the 21st century and that our expectations forsignificant curriculum revision or change in the nature of instruction simplywill not happen.andP;  The rhetoric and expectations of the eighties may have beenunrealistic.andP;  Or, it may simply be too soon to see the long-term benefits ofthe technology.andM;Clearly, our schools, as well as the corporate community, believe that theinvestment in technology is important.andP;  There is no indication that anyinstitution will discard the technology and return to a previous state.andO;Thus, the real question may be how to most effectively manage theseresources.andM;The extensive diversity of hardware and software described in this year'ssurvey leads to several pressing issues, which may become the focus of ourenergies and attention.andP;  Coping with the vast diversity is an increasingchallenge.andP;  Some academics will want the fastest processors and latestsoftware versions with the most advanced features.andP;  Others will be reluctantto give up their well-known software and systems, which adequately meet theirneeds.andP;  Thus, older viable generations of hardware and software will continueto be used (frequently filtering down into the administrative offices).andO;Support and training thus become exacerbated by problems such as differentkeyboards, monitors, disc drives, and memory capabilities, all whichconstrict software options and are frequently selected based on the lowestcommon denominator.andM;Providing hardware and software is only one part of the equation forsuccessful implementation of technology into a business school.andP;  Financialsupport for training, on-going consulting, and equipment maintenance isessential for a school to maximize its return on the computer investment.andO;Additional staff are required to support the growing diversity of hardwareand software inventories.andP;  Another challenge is leadership, findingindividuals with the vision and management skills to integrate the constantlydeveloping computer, communication, and information technologies, and tomaintain an appropriate balance between large and small systems.andM;How are business schools going to pay for the high cost of technology? Or, isit a high cost? For the past six surveys, schools have allocatedapproximately 3.5 percent of their total operating budget to support computeroperations.andP;  This translates into a median allocation of about $80 perstudent.andP;  But is this a sufficient allocation? The schools in the topquartile are spending six times this amount per student, an allocation ofapproximately 11 percent of their total school's operating budget.andM;What are our goals, and how do we measure them? What are the benefits of theinvestment in information technology, and are we achieving them? Whattechnological opportunities will become incorporated into our businessschools? These questions will be the focus of future UCLA Surveys of BusinessSchool Computer Usage.andM;Acknowledgments.andP;  The authors wish to thank those individuals who took thetime and care to complete the questionnaire.andP;  Without their efforts thissurvey would have been impossible.andP;  Thanks are also extended to the fifteenBusiness School Computing Center directors from around the country whoreviewed the draft questionnaire, Research Assistants Su-Tsen Christine Kuoand Victoria Nomura for their assistance with data entry and SAS dataanalyses, and Steve Bandler for his assistance in preparing the finaldocument.andP;  Apple Computer, Incorporated, Digital Equipment Corporation, andInternational Business Machines sponsored this year's survey project.andP;  Theircommitment has made this research possible.andM;CR Categories and Subject Descriptors: K.1 [Computing Milieux]: The ComputingIndustry-markets; K.2 [Computing Milieux]: History of Computing-hardware;K.3.0 [Computers and Education]: General; K.6.0 [Management of Computing andInformation Systems]: GeneralandM;General Terms: ManagementandM;Additional Key Words and Phrases: Business school computing environments,computer resources and services, computing environmentsandM;(Tables and other figures omitted)</TEXT></DOC>
