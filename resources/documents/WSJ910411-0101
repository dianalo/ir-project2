Selling was widespread among institutions andindividuals alike, traders said. Amgen slipped 2 1/4 to 1241/4; Centocor, which declared a 2-for-1 stock split payableMay 24, skidded 1 3/4 to 70 1/4; Xoma fell 1 3/4 to 25;   Chiron dropped 3 1/8 to 60; Biogen declined 1 1/2 to 343/8; and Genetics Institute fell 1 7/8 to 37 3/8.   But it was the debate swirling around Immunex that led thedecline, according to traders. The day's second most activeOTC stock, Immunex fell 3 to 48 1/2 on more than 2.2 millionshares, more than five times its average volume. Shares ofthe Seattlebased concern have plunged from Friday's close of57 since Oppenheimer andamp; Co. analyst Jeffrey Casdin urgedinvestors on Monday to avoid the stock.   Mr. Casdin said he was concerned that studies of Immunex'sproduct Leukine show that it might not be as useful intreating some kinds of cancer as a competing product made byAmgen. The analyst said Immunex may incur a loss in 1992rather than approach break-even as he previously expected,according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.   Immunex rebutted Mr. Casdin's report after the marketclosed yesterday. In a statement, Immunex said a study willbe released next month at the meeting of the American Societyof Clinical Oncology showing that the product helped certainchemotherapy problems in patients with sarcoma and that otherstudies will support the use of the product in treatingchemotherapy patients.   A far more bullish analyst is Jeffrey R. Swarz of GoldmanSachs, who said in an interview he stands by his &quot;buy&quot;opinion on Immunex issued Monday. He expects Immunex toreport earnings of 70 cents a share in fiscal 1991 and $2.50in 1992, boosted by successful sales of Leukine.   Some traders were encouraged that over-the-counter stocksdidn't fall further after Tuesday's 45.54-point drop in theDow Jones Industrial Average. But Charles Howley, manager ofOTC trading at Soundview Financial Corp., said he wouldadvise caution over the near term. He recommended locking inprofits and said he expects stocks to drift lower over thenext three to five weeks.   Some of the OTC market's largest stocks continued to loseground. Microsoft slipped 2 3/4 to 107 1/2; Apple Computerfell 1 7/8 to 66 7/8; Sun Microsystems eased 3/8 to 33; MCICommunications slipped 1/4 to 26; and McCaw Cellular Class Ashares slipped 3/4 to 26 1/2.
