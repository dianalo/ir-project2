Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, says its monthly poll of 51 analysts shows &quot;a near record&quot; diversity of opinion about corporate profits. While the March consensus projects a 2.9% rise in 1988 pretax profits, individual predictions range from Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.'s 17% increase to the UCLA Business Forecast's 26.1% decline.    &quot;There's a huge discrepancy in the economic forecasts,&quot; says Mickey Levy, chief economist of First Fidelity Bancorp. UCLA's profit outlook, for example, assumes a recession this year while Prudential-Bache predicts a fairly healthy economy. Also confusing the picture are last year's banking-industry losses and overseas profits generated by foreign currency translations, says Jerry Jordan, chief economist of First Interstate Bank, Los Angeles.    At Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., &quot;economists are looking for flat earnings&quot; but analysts see 30% gains, says Arnold Kaufman, editor of Sandamp;P's Outlook.    THE HEMLINE QUESTION has stores going both long and short.    &quot;Most retailers, convinced that the ultrashort skirt won't be a great seller, are hedging their bets by buying different lengths,&quot; says Kurt Barnard, publisher of a retail-marketing newsletter. In New York, Bloomingdale's display windows feature skirts at four lengths: thigh-high, above the knee, at the knee and just above the ankle. Noting that hemline confusion hurt fall sales, Tedford Marlow of Marshall Field's, Chicago, says, &quot;It's a very fickle environment right now.&quot; He expects most spring sales to be clustered around knee length.    A few stores are betting heavily on higher hemlines. Henri Bendel, New York, says 90% of its line will be short for the spring. In southern California, Lee Hogan Cass of Broadway department stores sees the spring look as &quot;totally short.&quot; But even these stores are eyeing lower hemlines for fall. Bendel's is now testing the longer look. Broadway says its fall inventory will include 40% short hemlines, 20% to 25% long lengths and 35% to 40% pants.    FAX MACHINE SALES zoom as prices drop and distribution improves.    Some 460,000 facsimile machines were installed in the U.S. last year, up from about 190,000 in 1986. The outlook for 1988 is also rosy, with sales likely to jump 50% to 100%, says Donald Ryan of CAP International Inc., Marshfield, Mass. &quot;By the early 1990s, you will have well over a million placements a year for a number of years,&quot; he says.    One reason is price, which has dropped to below $1,000 at many discount stores, despite unfavorable exchange rates. That makes fax machines affordable to small businesses and individuals. &quot;The low-end market seems to be fueling the growth,&quot; says Joseph Cosgrove of Sharp Electronics Corp., Mahwah, N.J., which last year created a division to focus on the home-office market. Fax machines are getting easier to buy, says Mr. Ryan, noting a shift from company salesmen to office-equipment dealers and retail stores.    The growth spawns other businesses. U.S. Fax Inc., Philadelphia, sells a fax network to help solve problems such as busy signals and traffic management.    A THOUSAND TIMES NO: To prepare new brokers for the rejection of making cold calls, Dain Bosworth Inc., Minneapolis, has trainees phoning to solicit funds for charitable organizations. In the past 18 months they've raised about $500,000.    POOR RETURNS are plaguing the U.S. Census Bureau's 1987 economic census. Due Feb. 15, 1987, only 30% of the 3.5 million forms were returned by last month. To prod businesses, the census bureau sends out reminders saying, &quot;Don't Hold Out.&quot;    THE HEALTHIEST U.S. CITY is Richmond, Va., says Health magazine, citing medical facilities, clean air, recreation areas and low cancer rates. Six cities -- Boston, Honolulu, Milwaukee, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Rochester and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre -- tied for second.    SOME LIFE INSURERS begin paying benefits before death.    Suffer a heart attack, and you'll get an advance payment of 25% of your death benefit under a new Jackson National Life Insurance Co. policy that covers six catastrophic illnesses. If confined to a nursing home for at least six months, you'll get 2% of your death benefit paid each month until it's gone under a First Penn-Pacific Life Insurance Co. policy. The National Travelers Life Co. version also pays 2% per month and will cover home care to keep the patient out of a long-term care facility.    It's &quot;a death benefit you don't have to die to get,&quot; says a Jackson National spokesman. Insurers hope these pre-death benefits will make life insurance more marketable to younger people and singles. But questions remain, including whether such a payment would be taxable, since it is neither a true death benefit nor an accident or health benefit, says Joseph Belth, a professor at Indiana University.    The additional cost: between 2% and 5% of usual life insurance policy premiums, insurers say.    BRIEFS: A Paterson, N.J., company that takes rejected merchandise and fixes it for a fee calls itself Whoopps Inc. . . . Some 90% of business schools teach ethics, but only 5% of graduate programs and 20% of undergraduate programs teach a separate course on the topic, says a survey by the Ethics Resource Center, Washington, D.C. </TEXT></DOC>
