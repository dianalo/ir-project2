Background </ITAG>Logging operations fell trees and transport logs, chips or whole treesfrom stump to mills for processing. In a report requested by OSHA, theBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has described United States logging operationsas follows. (BLS Bulletin 2203, <T3>Injuries in the Logging Industry, </T3>June 1984) (Reference 1):<ITAG tagnum="21">Logging methods are generally similar in all regions of the countrywhere trees are felled and converted into logs, although differences interrain, type, and size of timber will dictate some variation in procedures.The tree is felled, usually with a chainsaw, branches are cut off (limbing),and the tree is measured and cut into manageable lengths (bucking). Logsare then transported (skidded or yarded) to central locations (landings)by one of several methods. Where the ground is relatively flat, logs arehooked to a tractor, known as a skidder, by steel cables and nooses calledchokers, and dragged to the landing [tractor or cat logging] where furthertrimming and processing may be done. If terrain is very steep or rough,the logs may be transported by steel cables attached to a remote winchingapparatus (called a yarder) via a system of cables, blocks, pulleys, andcarriages [cable logging]. Logs are either partially suspended and draggedover the ground (high-lead yarding) or actually hoisted into the air andconveyed on overhead cables (sky-line yarding) to the landing. After logsare yarded, they are loaded, either manually or mechanically, onto trucks,railroad cars, or barges, or formed into logs rafts for transport to thesawmill.</ITAG>OSHA agrees with the BLS analysis that logging methods are generally similarthroughout the country with some variation in procedure dictated by differencesin terrain, type and size of timber, as explained below. OSHA also believesthat the logging methods and the inherent dangers posed by work in thewoods, such as those caused by inclement weather, uneven terrain and isolationfrom health care facilities, present comparable and significant hazardsto loggers across the nation. Nevertheless, current OSHA safety standardsfor logging specifically address only one segment of the logging industry_loggingoperations whose forest product ends up as pulp. OSHA's current General Industry safety standards, 29 CFR Part 1910, wereoriginally published on May 29, 1971, pursuant to section 6(a) of the OccupationalSafety and Health Act (OSH Act), 29 U.S.C. 655(a), which directed OSHAto promulgate, during the two years following the Act's effective date,national consensus standards and established Federal standards withoutpublic comment or hearing. When these original OSHA standards were issuedthere was no national consensus standard or established Federal standardavailable that covered all types of logging. However, the American NationalStandards Institute (ANSI) had adopted a national consensus standard, ANSI03.1-1971, ``Safety Requirements for Pulpwood Logging,'' for the pulpwoodlogging industry only. This national consensus standard was primarily concernedwith pulpwood logging in the states of North Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas,Oklahoma, Texas, and all states east of those five states where loggingwas undertaken. OSHA's pulpwood logging standard, 29 CFR 1910.266, adoptedMay 29, 1971, was developed from ANSI 03.1-1971. Since it was an industry-specificstandard, it was placed in 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart R, Special Industries.The remainder of the high hazard logging industry involved in logging otherthan pulpwood was not covered by a specific Federal standard.After OSHA's adoption of the 1971 ANSI pulpwood logging standard, tradeassociations with interests in the logging of other forest products, suchas sawlogs and veneer bolts, joined with ANSI to revise the consensus standardto include all logging within the United States. An expanded ANSI standardwas approved May 19, 1977, as ANSI 03.1-1978, ``Safety Requirements forLogging.'' That document adopted, virtually unchanged, most of the safetypractices in the 1971 pulpwood logging safety standard, and now appliedthem to all logging operations throughout the nation. The 1978 ANSI logging standard, however, was withdrawn by ANSI in 1984.The American Pulpwood Association (APA), which had acted as Secretariatfor the 03 Committee during its deliberations on the 1971 and 1978 ANSIstandards, was no longer interested in serving as Secretariat. The APAfelt that the existing OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.266, was adequate fortheir membership. Because no other member of the committee wanted to takeover the secretariat, and ANSI procedures require that action be takento reaffirm, revise, or withdraw a standard no later than five years fromthe date of its publication, the standard was withdrawn. Currently no safetyor health national consensus standard exists for the logging industry.In July 1976, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health(NIOSH), published a criteria document, ``Recommendations For An OccupationalStandard For Logging From Felling To First Haul'' applicable to all loggingoperations. The NIOSH document addressed the hazard involved in felling,bucking, limbing, yarding and loading operations. The NIOSH document emphasized safe work practices. It intended to protectworkers against accidents and injuries by use of existing technology. Itdid not intend to inhibit flexibility in the way a task is performed norrestrict the development of safer techniques. The NIOSH document differed from the present Federal pulpwood logging standard29 CFR 1910.266, in the following ways: (a) It included all logging operations such as those relating to sawlogs,veneer bolts, poles and pilings rather than being limited only to pulpwoodoperations. (b) Training of employees was required. (c) The recommended standard did not include provisions dealing with equipmentprotective devices, personnel transport, off-highway truck transport, chippingoperations, or the construction and maintenance of roads, trails, and bridges.(d) Pre-placement and periodic medical examinations were recommended. OSHA's proposed standard for logging essentially adopts NIOSH's recommendationsfor expanded coverage of all logging, its emphasis on proper work practicesand training and its elimination of regulatory language not peculiar tologging operations such as that involving construction of roads and bridges.Six states have developed their own logging standards under the OSH ActState Plan procedure set forth in section 18 of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C.667, and in OSHA regulations, 29 CFR Part 1902. These states are Alaska,California, Hawaii, Michigan, Oregon and Washington. California, Hawaiiand Michigan have adopted logging standards that uniformly cover all loggingoperations within their respective borders. Alaska has adopted a generallogging safety standard including a specific section for pulpwood loggingwhich is similar to OSHA's pulpwood logging standard. Washington and Oregonhave adopted separate safety standards for nonpulpwood logging in additionto their general logging safety standards. Washington has adopted a pulpwoodlogging safety standard similar to that of OSHA in addition to the state'sgeneral logging safety standard. In general, the standards of the five far western states contain a muchhigher level of detail and specification than either the 1978 ANSI standardor the current OSHA standard on pulpwood logging. They reflect the generallymore dangerous nature of logging in those states because of rough terrain,large timber and isolated operations. OSHA used these standards as sourcedocuments during development of the proposal. Approximately 37 percent of all loggers are covered by state plan statestandards. Non-pulpwood loggers in the rest of the country remain unprotectedby a federal or an OSHA approved state standard specifically covering loggers.OSHA  proposes to issue safety standards covering all loggers regardlessof the end use of the forest products they produce. OSHA believes thata standard similar to the 1978 ANSI standard may be preferable for nationaluse, since many of its requirements were stated in performance language.This is in keeping with OSHA's belief that properly drafted performancestandards can adequately address safety and health hazards, while detailedspecification standards may needlessly impede technological advancementand employer innovation. A base level of safety would be provided for alllogging operations on a National scale, and those State Plan states withmore complicated or specialized local conditions could follow OSHA proceduresto develop their own more comprehensive standards, as Michigan and thefive far western states have done. OSHA requests public comment on whether detailed OSHA regulations are moreappropriate for all or part of the standard, or if the proposed performanceapproach is adequately protective on a national basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Hazards of the Logging Industry</ITAG> Logging is one of the most dangerous occupations. By its physical natureit is a very difficult job with little room for error. Loggers are oftendealing with the massive weight and irresistible momentum of falling, rolling,and sliding trees and logs. Logging operations are generally carried outin remote locations with limited accessibility, which vary in terrain fromflat lands, wetlands, or gentle slopes to rugged mountains. As outdoorworkers, loggers may be exposed to bitter cold, extreme heat, rain andsnow. These factors, along with the use of the always potentially dangerouschain saw, have kept the logging industry consistently among the most hazardousin the country. The following summaries of news reports from several states of loggingaccidents characterize the nature of the hazards in this industry: 1. A 42-year-old logger in Idaho died of massive injuries in a loggingaccident about 2:30 p.m. on December 19, 1986, after a fir tree fell onhim when he was sawing another tree. After the logger failed to returnhome his employer returned to the logging site and found his body about10 p.m. The proposal addresses this type of accident in andSection; 1910.266(d),Training, and (e)(4) (i) and (ii), Work areas. 2. A 52-year-old logger was killed in Arkansas on April 28, 1987. A treehe had felled either lodged or struck another tree, then kicked back strikinghim in the chest. The logger was working alone when he was killed. Theproposal addresses the causal factors pertinent to this accident in andSection;1910.266(d), Training, (e)(3), Environmental conditions, (e)(4), Work areas,and (g)(2), Manual felling. 3. A 30-year-old in Arkansas was killed on September 29, 1987, when a treehe had cut fell on him. The tree first fell into the limbs of another tree.A coworker said he would get a log skidder to pull the cut tree to theground, but the logger decided to cut down the supporting tree instead.When he did so the first tree fell on him. The proposal addresses factorsinvolved in this accident in andSection; 1910.266(d), Training and (g), Treeharvesting. 4. A tree felled by a feller struck and killed a 44-year-old logger inSouth Carolina on January 2, 1985. The feller was cutting the tree andstopped to make some repairs to his chain saw. The feller reported thatwhen he went back to the tree it had started to fall. The victim was standingin its path with his back to the tree. The proposal addresses the factorsinvolved in this accident in andSection; 1910.266(d), Training and (g), Treeharvesting. 5. On November 30, 1984, a 26-year-old Pennsylvania man working at a lumbercompany logging site was preparing to cut a log with a gasoline-poweredchain saw. State police reported that the chain saw kicked back and cuthim severely down through the left shoulder area. He was pronounced deadat the scene by the county deputy coroner. The proposal addresses the causesof this accident in andSection; 1910.266(d), Training, and (e)(5), Chainsaw operations. 6. On August 12, 1987, a 29-year-old North Carolina logger, working alone,was killed when a tree fell on him. He was apparently cutting one treewhen another tree, lodged in it, fell on him. No one witnessed the accident.The proposal addresses the factors pertinent to this accident in andSection;1910.266(d), Training, (e)(3), Environmental conditions, and (g), Treeharvesting. 7. A 29-year-old California logger was trapped inside the crumpled cabof a log loading machine on September 25, 1985, when the machine tippedover on a downslope. He was removed by firemen after 45 minutes, with minorinjuries. The proposal addresses this accident situation in andSection; 1910.266(d),Training, and (f), Equipment protective devices. 8. On September 17, 1984, a 32-year-old Montana man was killed drivinga skidder when he hit a tree that was leaning towards him at a 45-degreeangle. A representative of the Missoula County Sheriff's Department saidthe tree hit the logger in the head, killing him instantly. The proposaladdresses the factors involved in this accident in andSection; 1910.266(d),Training, (e)(3), Environmental conditions, and (f) Equipment protectivedevices. 9. A 62-year-old Idaho logger was seriously injured on January 8, 1985,when he was hit and pinned by a tree he was cutting down. The deputy whoresponded said the incident was a freak accident that occurs in cold weather.``When you're falling trees in the winter, you're working with some factorsthat aren't present the rest of the year when the trees are in their naturalstate,'' he said. The tree tipped back the wrong way, split due to itscold weather brittleness and then began to spin. He said that the loggercould not tell which way it would fall and could not make a decision onwhich way to stand clear. The proposal addresses this accident scenarioin andSection; 1910.266(d), Training, and (g), Tree harvesting. The Bureau of Labor Statistics Bulletin 2203, ``Injuries in the LoggingIndustry'' (Reference 1), reports the findings of a survey conducted byBLS during the short period April through June 1982, of 1,086 injured loggingworkers in the 12 states of Alaska, Arkansas, California, Kentucky, Maine,Montana, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.The report describes logging operations and hazards as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">At every step in the logging process, from felling the tree to transportingit to the mill, workers are subject to a variety of hazards from the environment,type of work, and equipment used. Weather conditions are often poor sincelogging may continue regardless of rain, snow, or excessive heat. Terrainmay be steep or rocky and, inevitably, ground litter, such as deadwood,leaves, or vines presents obstacles that restrict worker freedom of movement.In addition, workers may encounter other hazards and nuisances such assnakes, stinging insects, poison ivy or poison oak.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The trees themselves present hazards due to their weight and bulk.Improper cutting, defects in the wood, or unexpected gusts of wind cancause a tree to fall improperly. Moreover, once on the ground, logs mayroll or shift without warning. The equipment loggers use can also posehazards. Chain saws may kick back into the operator if the cut is not precise,if the blade is dull, or for a variety of other reasons. Skidding tractorsoften must be operated on uneven trails, increasing the risk of rollover,and overhead yarding systems have a variety of moving parts that may causeinjury to the workers. Most logging work is physically demanding and operationsare usually carried on as long as there is daylight or longer if floodlightsare used.</ITAG>BLS Bulletin 2203 illustrates the potential for injury in these loggingactivities by a brief description of the logging process itself and theattendant hazards, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">In felling a tree, the cutter must take into consideration weatherconditions, especially wind; terrain and slope of the cutting site; thecondition of the tree (particularly its lean) and trees surrounding it;and where the tree will ultimately fall. If any of the cuts required tofell the tree are made improperly, the tree may fall in the wrong place;snap off the stump (an occurrence known as barber-chairing), or becometangled in other trees on the way down. As the tree falls, limbs can breakoff or deadwood can be catapulted from the ground when the tree lands.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After the tree is felled, most of the limbs must be removed beforeit can be transported from the cutting site. lf the tree is large, it willbe bucked into shorter, more manageable lengths. Both limbing and buckingare potentially hazardous since felled trees may be unstable and work ofteninvolves climbing over logs and cutting in awkward positions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Once trees are felled, limbed and bucked, they must be transportedto the landing site. Logs are either attached to tractors for tractor skidding,or to cable systems for cable yarding. Workers known as choker settersslip a noose or choker around the log and fasten it. This, in turn, ishooked up to the tractor cable or cable yarding system. Choker settersare subject to many of the same hazards as fallers, limbers, and buckers;the primary dangers are shifting logs, falling wood, or unsafe footing.Skidder operators, on the other hand, must contend with narrow, often uneven,skid trails. The operator must guard against overturning the tractor, beingstruck by limbs from surrounding trees, or getting his turn of logs caughton obstructions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When logs reach the landing, they are unhooked from the yarding system.If tractor skidding is performed, the tractor operator may handle thistask but if a cable yarding system is used, workers known as chasers unhookthe logs. The wood is then stacked to await loading for transport to themill.</ITAG>As demonstrated in the previous discussion of nine accidents, these hazardsare addressed in the proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Accident Data </ITAG>Accident data demonstrate the high level of danger to workers in the loggingindustry. Since 1972 there has been a significant overall decrease in injury andillness rates among loggers nationwide, although the severity of accidentshas increased slightly. BLS occupational injury and illness data for theyears 1972 through 1986 (References 2 through 10, and 30), expressed asincidence rates per 100 full-time workers, have been compiled into Table1 below. For comparison and to indicate the particularly hazardous natureof logging operations, Table 1 also includes incidence rates for the entiremanufacturing sector, SIC 20-39, for 1981-1986. Table 1 shows significantimprovement in injury and illness rates in logging during the period. Therewas a 41 percent reduction in total cases. Lost workday cases (non-fatalinjuries or illness that result in days away from work, or days of restrictedwork activity, or both), were cut by 22 percent. Nonfatal cases withoutlost workdays were reduced 60 percent. However, the number of lost workdaysper 100 full-time workers during the period shown in the Table has onlyimproved by 5 percent. The lost workdays per 100 fulltime loggers was higherin 1985 than it was in the early 1970's, and averaged about 308 days forthe period. This indicates that although the number of accidents has decreased,the severity of logging accidents has remained about the same.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Occupational Injury and Illness Incidence Rates Per </T4>100 <T4>Full-Time Workers</T4><H1>Year</H1><H1>Total cases</H1><H1>Lost workday cases</H1><H1>Nonfatal without lost workdays</H1><H1>Lost workdays</H1><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>Logging Camps and Logging Contractors, SIC 241</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1972<D>32.5</D><D>16.2</D><D>16.1</D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1973<D>32.0</D><D>16.5</D><D>15.3</D><D>307.8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1974<D>29.2</D><D>15.8</D><D>13.3</D><D>296.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1975<D>26.1</D><D>14.5</D><D>11.5</D><D>281.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1976<D>25.1</D><D>14.0</D><D>10.9</D><D>287.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1977<D>26.3</D><D>15.4</D><D>10.7</D><D>329.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1978<D>25.9</D><D>15.6</D><D>10.2</D><D>316.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1979<D>24.2</D><D>14.8</D><D>9.3</D><D>311.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1980<D>22.7</D><D>13.9</D><D>8.6</D><D>338.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1981<D>19.3</D><D>12.3</D><D>6.9</D><D>289.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1982<D>20.4</D><D>12.9</D><D>7.3</D><D>303.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1983<D>21.5</D><D>13.7</D><D>7.7</D><D>321.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1984<D>21.7</D><D>13.9</D><D>7.7</D><D>320.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1985<D>20.0</D><D>12.2</D><D>7.6</D><D>317.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1986<D>19.1</D><D>12.6</D><D>6.4</D><D>293.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>Manufacturing, SIC 20 through 39</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1981<D>11.5</D><D>5.1</D><D>6.4</D><D>82.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1982<D>10.2</D><D>4.4</D><D>5.8</D><D>75.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1983<D>10.0</D><D>4.3</D><D>5.7</D><D>73.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1984<D>10.6</D><D>4.7</D><D>5.9</D><D>77.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1985<D>10.4</D><D>4.6</D><D>5.8</D><D>80.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1986<D>10.6</D><D>4.7</D><D>5.9</D><D>85.2</D></ITAG></ITAG>California is one of the states that has been active in logging safety.The November 1982 issue of the ``Work Injuries and Illnesses in California,Quarterly'' (Reference 11) contains a summary of fatalities in the Californialogging industry since 1950. The summary did not contain any nonfatal injuryor illness data. Over the decade of the 1950's, a total of 457 logging employees lost theirlives in industrial accidents in California (an average of 45.7 per year).During the 1960's, the fatality count in logging was nearly cut in halfto 235 deaths (an average of 23.5 per year). In the 1970's, total fatalitiesrecorded in logging declined to 135 (an average of 13.5 per year), anda 70 percent reduction from the number of deaths recorded in the 1950's.In both 1980 and 1981, the number of fatalities in California's loggingindustry hit new all-time lows. Six deaths were recorded in 1980; fourdeaths in 1981. This reflects, in part, the fact that the lumber industryin California had been hit hard by the slowdown in construction activity,which resulted in reduced employment from 6,100 workers in 1977 to 3,900in 1982. The California Quarterly attributes the decrease in logging fatalitiesin California over the 30-year period to two major factors: (1) Greatersafety awareness; and (2) giant strides in technology in the industry,so that the equipment used today is safer and better designed. The publicationalso states that the years have also seen a shift from cat logging to cablelogging. Cat logging is much more labor intensive, requiring far more employeeson the ground and thus exposed to logging hazards. This shift to cablelogging in the western part of the United States is an example of the industrymaking use of the equipment most appropriate for local operating conditions.Unfortunately, in spite of the reduction in logger accidents, as demonstratedby the decreases in injury and illness rates, and by the California experiencewith regard to fatalities, logging remains among the most dangerous industries.BLS data indicate that the incidence rate of injuries and illness in 1986was twice that of manufacturing in general, and the lost workdays (reflectingthe severity of the injuries) were three times that of manufacturing (seeTable 1). In fact, in 1986, the logging industry had the 32nd highest rateof injuries and illnesses per 100 full-time workers among all industries(19.1) (Reference 31). With regard to lost workday cases, disregardingcases where neither lost time nor restricted work activity resulted, loggingranked 8th worst among all industries (12.6), behind special product sawmillsSIC 2429 (25.4), manufacturing of vitreous plumbing fixtures SIC 3261 (17.5),structural wood member manufacturing SIC 2439 (15.4), reclaimed rubberSIC 3030 (15.2), meat packing plants SIC 2011 (14.7), animal and marinefats and oils SIC 2077 (13.7), and prefabricated wood buildings SIC 2452(13.2). Moreover, logging ranked 5th worst in lost workdays per 100 workers(293.0), behind water transportation services SIC 4460 (404.9), intercityhighway transportation SIC 4130 (333.4), special product sawmills SIC 2429(319.9), and reclaimed rubber SIC 3030 (304.9).

Logging injuries are frequentlyof the most severe nature, many times resulting in death. Fatality datapublished by BLS do not provide the number of fatalities for the loggingindustry. However, data from OSHA's Management Information System_althoughnot providing information for the country as a whole_do provide some indicationof the number of fatalities. During 1983, there were 66 logging fatalitiesreported to OSHA from the 37 states in the reporting system at that time.This would be equivalent to 89 fatalities on a national basis. Based ona logging population of 81,000 for 1983, this would be a fatality incidencerate of 110 per 100,000 workers. In comparison, BLS fatality data indicatea fatality incidence rate for 1983 of 27.6 for the mining industry, 22.9for construction, and only 4.8 for the private sector as a whole (Reference9). Several older studies analyzing the distribution of injuries among thevarious logging jobs and the operations or agents associated with injurieshave been reviewed by OSHA and are included in the docket. The previouslymentioned BLS Bulletin 2203 (Reference 1) is the most recently releasedstudy and it summarized the accident causes as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The survey revealed that one-half of these workers were injured whileengaged in cutting operations such as felling trees, bucking logs, or removinglimbs from felled trees. Injuries resulted equally from workers being struckor crushed by wood (logs, trees, etc.), and from slipping, tripping, orfalling (24 percent each) while 20 percent of the injuries resulted fromcontact with chain saws. Almost three-fourths of those injured missed oneor more days of work as a result of their accidents, while one-fifth werehospitalized an average of six nights.</ITAG>It should be noted that the survey excluded injuries resulting in fatalities.In an analysis of accidents by type of occupation, the report continued:<ITAG tagnum="21">Nearly one-half the injured workers were employed in occupations thatdealt almost exclusively with cutting timber or trimming logs * * *. Theseoccupations were: chopper, cutter, saw operator, or saw hand; faller, faller-bucker,or bullbuck; logger; sawyer; and bucker, busheler, or woodsman. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sixteen percent of the workers were in occupations associated withyarding operations at the landing site: chaser; hooker or hook-tender;rigging slinger; knot bumper; and stationary equipment operator. An equalproportion were classified either as choker setter or skidder operator,occupations involved in transporting logs away from the cutting site.</ITAG>The report further characterized the accidents by activity at the timeof accident:<ITAG tagnum="21">Nearly one-quarter of the injuries were accounted for by workers fellingtrees, while those limbing and bucking accounted for 15 and 12 percentof the injuries respectively. Workers who were choker setting or hookingup ``turns'' (logs grouped and yarded together) experienced 14 percentof the injuries; workers engaged in tractor or cable skidding operations,nine percent of the injuries. The proportions of injuries resulting fromchasing activities and loading or unloading were five percent each. Fourpercent of the injuries occurred to workers involved in rigging cable yardingsystems (setting up skid cables, blocks and tackles, guylines, etc.).</ITAG>The discussion in this section has shown that, although the number of loggingaccidents has decreased greatly since 1972, the accident rates for loggingare very high and had increased in 1982, 1983 and 1984 before decreasingslightly again in 1985 and 1986. Although OSHA does not know the breakdownof all injuries between pulpwood or non-pulpwood logging, similar hazardsexist in both. Of the thousand injured loggers BLS surveyed, 47% respondedthat they were engaged in non-pulpwood logging, 35% believed they wereinvolved in pulpwood logging, and 17% did not know what type of wood theywere harvesting. Therefore, OSHA believes that it is reasonable to proposea uniform national logging standard. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Significant Risk and Basis for Proposal </ITAG>The seriousness of the risk in the logging industry is demonstrated insections II and III of this preamble. Section II describes the unusualand extreme physical hazards inherent to the working conditions of theemployees in the industry. Table 1 in section III presents incidence ratesper 100 full-time workers for SIC 241, Logging Camps and Logging Contractors,for each year from 1972 through 1986, and Table 2 lists comparative datafor other industry sectors. The significant risk to workers in the logging industry is characterizedby the following conclusions from this analysis: 1. Workers in logging have a higher risk of injury than workers in mostother industries. 2. If they are injured, loggers have a greater chance of losing workdays.3. When they are injured, their injuries are much more serious and resultin much more lost time than do the injuries of most other workers. 4. Workers in logging have a higher incidence of fatalities than workersin other industries.      In 1977 the leading states in logging employment (with 48 percent of thetotal) were Washington (15,400), Oregon (14,000), California (6,100) andMaine (4,300). By 1982 the employment pattern had shifted and the leadingstates (with 42 percent of the total) were Washington (11,900, down 3,500);Oregon (11,300, down 2,700); Georgia (5,400, up 1,600); and Alabama (5,000,up 1,200). (Reference 11). California (3,900 down 2,200), was no longerone of the leaders. Overall logging employment in the Pacific Coast statesdecreased 22% during this period. The South was the only region in thecountry to show an increase in logging employment (21%). This employmenttrend, resulting in the change from harvesting the Pacific Coast's old-growthtimber to increased harvesting of third and fourth-growth pine forestsin the south, means that an increasing proportion of logging employmentis in states not covered by state logging standards. (As noted earlier,only Alaska (16th in 1982), California (7th), Hawaii (very small), Michigan(19th), Oregon (2nd) and Washington (lst) have OSHA approved state loggingstandards covering all loggers.) OSHA believes that standards are part of an integrated approach to successfullogging safety that includes training, cooperation between labor and management,continued advancement of technology in the industry, and constant developmentof safety awareness. This rulemaking proposes standards for logging safetywhich OSHA believes will protect worker safety and health in the loggingindustry to the extent possible. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Summary and Explanation of the Proposal </ITAG>It is clear from the preceding discussion that the dangers of logging extracta high injury and death toll from loggers. Although the number of injurieshave been declining as demonstrated in section III, the injury and deathrates remain high. The current OSHA standard andSection; 1910.266 addresses only pulpwood logging.This proposed standard would provide protection for all loggers involvedin harvesting, including loggers employed as part of a mill operation,regardless of the end use of the forest products (saw logs, veneer bolts,pulpwood, chips, etc.). This proposal fills the current gap in coverageby providing a basic level of protection for all loggers. OSHA proposesthat the title of andSection; 1910.266 be changed from ``Pulpwood Logging''to ``Logging Operations'' in order to reflect the wider coverage of theproposed amendment. <T3>Paragraph (a), ``Scope.'' </T3>Proposed paragraph (a) outlines thescope of the standard as a specific standard for the logging industry coveringnumerous operations involved in the harvesting of timber or pulpwood. Thescope has been expanded to add coverage for other than pulpwood logging.Although the proposed standard does not specifically address the setupof cable yarding systems, several provisions of the proposed standard areapplicable to cable yarding activities. Provisions proposed in andSection;1910.266(e)(6), ``Stationary and mobile equipment;'' andSection; 1910.266(f),``Equipment protective devices_stationary and mobile equipment;'' and andSection;1910.266(9)(6), ``Skidding, forwarding and yarding,'' will protect employeesfrom the vast majority of cable yarding hazards. State plan states in thefar west that have the most significant cable logging activity have developedvery detailed cable logging standards. In view of these circumstances,and since there is limited cable logging activity in the rest of the country,OSHA requests public comment on the need to issue more detailed cable yardingsafety regulations. <T3>Paragraph (b), ``Application.'' </T3>Proposed paragraph (b)(1) reiteratesthe expanded coverage of this proposal. The coverage of all types of logging,including pulpwood harvesting as well as the logging of saw logs, veneerbolts and other forest products, is identified to clarify the expansionof the scope from pulpwood logging only. Proposed paragraph (b)(2) explains that hazards and working conditionsnot specifically covered by this industry standard continue to be coveredby the other applicable sections of Part 1910, the standards for generalindustry. Construction operations are covered by Part 1926. This paragraphis intended to clarify the use of Part 1910 and Part 1926 when andSection;1910.266 does not address the operation. <T3>Paragraph (c), ``Definitions.'' </T3>The proposed amendment containsdefinitions of terms used in logging. These definitions are from severalsources, including the following: ANSI 03.1-1971 Pulpwood Logging; ANSI03.1-1978 Logging, (withdrawn by ANSI in 1984); 29 CFR 1910.266; variousstate safety standards; and contacts with the U.S. Forest Service and otherpersons and organizations involved in logging. <T3>Paragraph (d), ``Training.'' </T3>OSHA has included training requirementsin the proposal. Training is considered very important in logging accidentprevention due to the highly labor intensive nature of the work and itsstrenuous physical demands. OSHA believes that many accidents in the woodsare preventable through properly applied work practices. It is the employer'sresponsibility to ensure that work is accomplished in a safe manner throughsuitable training and supervision. In (d)(1), OSHA would require training of new employees when hired, andcurrent employees given job assignments which expose them to new hazards.The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that all employees understandthe hazards to which they are exposed, and how to work safely in spiteof those hazards. Every new employee, regardless of experience, would receivetraining before beginning work. Retraining would be required at least annuallyto keep safety awareness, knowledge and safe work practice at a high level.As a minimum, training would include recognition of and preventive andprotective measures for the hazards associated with the individual's worktasks, and general recognition and prevention of safety hazards in thelogging industry. Although, actual training may vary depending upon theprevious experience of the employees, before being permitted to begin theirwork, employees must first demonstrate to their employer their abilityto perform their assignment safely. In (d)(2), OSHA would require training of power tool operators, machineoperators, and associated maintenance personnel. Before they perform theirduties they would be required to demonstrate that they can do so safely.OSHA considers this training to be very important due to the potentialhazards presented by chain saws, yarding machines and other harvestingequipment. In (d)(3), OSHA would require that all workers inexperienced in a taskbe under the close guidance of a person experienced in the safe performanceof the task being accomplished. OSHA wants to ensure that recently trainedemployees have close support until it is determined that they are sufficientlyable to work in a safe manner. Several State Plan states have adopted various training requirements intheir logging standards. For example, Oregon has detailed training andsupervision provisions that include requirements for a written trainingprogram, monthly safety meetings for all employees, and an accident investigationprogram (Oregon Admin. R. 437-80-015). Alaska requires monthly safety meetingsto inform employees of the employer's safety policies and applicable Alaskaoccupational safety and health standards (Alaska Admin. Code Tit. 8, section07.115(d)). California's standard, however, is not as detailed as Oregon'sand Alaska's, only requiring employers to have ``a reasonably effectiveaccident prevention program'' (Cal. Admin. Code Tit. 8, section 6250).OSHA requests comment on the effectiveness and feasibility of the varioustraining and supervision requirements in State Plan states' standards,and elsewhere, and whether they should be adopted as part of the FederalOSHA standard. Comments are also requested on the extent, frequency andtypes of current training programs. <T3>Paragraph (e), ``General requirements.'' </T3>In (e)(1), OSHA proposesrequirements for clothing, personal protective equipment, and first aid.In subparagraphs (e)(1)(iv), (v), (vi) and (vii), the proposal explicitlystates that requirements in the General Industry standards at 29 CFR Part1910, Subparts I and G, governing the recognition and abatement of hazardsto the head, eyes, face, extremities, respiratory system and the hearingof employees, are applicable to the logging industry. These are not newrequirements. The logging industry is presently required to comply withthe General Industry standards, and the pulpwood logging standard at andSection;1910.266(c)(1) (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) references the same requirements.The explicit statements are intended to aid employers and employees inrecognizing the need for, and proper selection of, personal protectiveequipment. The statements are not meant to imply that other applicablegeneral industry or construction standards not explicitly mentioned inthe proposed logging standard apply with any less force. Other requirements are proposed in paragraph (e) as follows: In (e)(1)(i), OSHA proposes the use of suitable heavy duty puncture resistantgloves when working with wire rope. The current OSHA pulpwood standardrequires gloves when handling wire rope, but does not specify the type.OSHA proposes that the provision specifically address the hazard of lacerationfrom wire rope. OSHA solicits information about the most appropriate typesof gloves for handling wire rope in the logging industry. In (e)(1)(ii), OSHA proposes that employees whose assigned duties requirethem to operate a chain saw wear ballistic nylon or equivalent protectioncovering each leg from the upper thigh to the boot top or shoe top. Thecurrent OSHA pulpwood logging standard does not contain this requirement.However, although this is a new regulatory requirement, both the 1971 ANSIpulpwood logging standard and the 1978 ANSI logging standard had recommendedthat chain saw operators wear ballistic nylon or equivalent leg protection.OSHA believes the lightweight material offers considerable protection tothe operator from chain saw-induced leg injuries. OSHA is also of the opinionthat if slightly reduced mobility results from the wearing of such legprotectors, such reduced mobility presents less risk of accidents thannot wearing them when other provisions of this proposal are complied with.For example, mobility is not as important when fellers clear retreat pathsprior to beginning their cut, and buckers either stand uphill from thelog they are cutting or block it from rolling or swinging. The proposal exempts, however, but does not prohibit, individuals workingfrom bucket trucks, and in some instances climbers, from wearing the requiredleg protection when operating a chain saw. OSHA believes that in some instancesthe leg protection could interfere with climbers' ability to move safelywithin trees, posing a greater hazard. Chain saw operators working froma bucket truck would be adequately protected from injury by the bucketitself. OSHA solicits comment on the appropriateness of these exemptions.In (e)(1)(iii), OSHA proposes a performance standard requiring employeesto wear either safety boots or safety shoes (excluding low cut shoes),or heavy duty logging style boots with lug or calk soles, which are appropriatefor the employee's job, the terrain, the timber type, and the weather conditions.What constitutes proper footwear for loggers is currently the subject ofsome debate in the industry. The OSHA pulpwood standard requires safety-toefootwear to be provided. The 1971 ANSI pulpwood safety standard had recommended,in addition to recommending safety footwear, that calks be used where applicable.The 1978 ANSI logging standard required that employees ``wear safety boots,safety shoes or calk boots or other substantial footwear depending on thejob, the terrain and timber.'' The 1978 ANSI 03.1 committee made knownits belief in Appendix B to that standard that calks should be worn inmost Western logging operations because of ``conditions'' existing there.OSHA solicits information concerning the effective use of protective footwearin logging operations. In (e)(1)(viii), OSHA proposes a performance standard for first aid kits.The provision would require that sufficient numbers of adequately suppliedfirst aid kits be provided at the worksite and on all crew vehicles. Thekit requirements are not specific because of the wide variety of conditionsand number of employees to be served at different worksites. The provisionembodies the same requirements found in the current pulpwood standard.Non-pulpwood logging operators are presently required by the General Industrystandards, 29 CFR 1910.151(b), to maintain readily available first aidsupplies approved by a consulting physician in the absence of an infirmary,clinic or hospital in near proximity to the worksite. In (e)(1)(ix), OSHA proposes to address the hazards posed by poisonoussnakes in the woods. The proposal adopts the OSHA pulpwood logging standard'srequirement that snake bite kits must be included with first aid equipmentin areas where poisonous snakes may exist, except that alternative firstaid treatment may be substituted on the documented recommendation of aphysician or other authoritative source. The latter provision had beenadopted in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. In (e)(1)(x), OSHA proposes first aid training for all supervisors andfellers, and that at least one person with such training be in the areaof operation. Such training is considered particularly important by OSHAbecause the severity of many logging injuries, often at very isolated worklocations, requires quick and effective first aid. OSHA believes the needfor training in first aid methods such as are prescribed by the AmericanRed Cross, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, or an equivalenttraining program, is recognized in the industry. The 1978 ANSI loggingstandard required that at least one person in each area be trained in firstaid by such organizations. The requirements in the several state standardsare quite varied. In (e)(2), OSHA proposes nine fairly routine provisions concerning safeuse and care of hand tools and equipment. Each of these requirements isin the OSHA pulpwood logging standard. The 1978 ANSI logging standard alsoadopted these hand tool provisions. The provisions are intended to protectemployees from hazards which are recognized throughout the industry. Handtools such as wedges and cutting tools are extensively used in the loggingindustry. These provisions will protect employees from hazards such asthose caused by dull tools, loose handles, and metal chips from mushroomedtool heads.In (e)(3), OSHA addresses hazards associated with environmental conditionsthat cause significant danger to employees. The BLS Survey (Reference 1)found that environmental conditions specifically addressed in the proposedstandard were contributing factors in 30 percent of the injuries at theworksite. It is the employer's responsibility to assure that employeesare protected from these conditions. In (e)(3)(i), OSHA proposes termination of work and movement of employeesto safe places during electrical storms, periods of high winds or otherweather conditions which may endanger personnel. The intent is to protectemployees from lightning, falling trees and limbs, and other weather-inducedhazards. The OSHA pulpwood logging standard and the 1978 ANSI standard include nearlythe same provision as proposed (e)(3)(i), however, those standards usethe phrase ``or unusual weather conditions.'' The word ``unusual'' hasbeen deleted from the proposal because OSHA believes it might be misinterpreted.OSHA proposes that work terminate when weather conditions pose a dangerto loggers, regardless of whether the condition is unusual for the region.In (e)(3) (ii), (iii) and (iv), OSHA proposes several work practices toprotect employees from the dangers presented by falling dead, broken orrotted trees and limbs; by falling loose bark on snags which are to befelled; and by falling snow and ice in trees. OSHA proposes that no workbe allowed in the danger area until a hazard is dealt with, except forthe purpose of making the area safe. In (e)(4), OSHA addresses hazards related to the usual isolation of loggingwork areas, the possibility of the actions of one employee causing hazardsfor another, and hazards to employees caused by fire. Several of the fatalaccidents described in Section II of this preamble demonstrate the hazardsaddressed in these provisions. In (e)(4)(i), OSHA proposes that most employees work within visual or audiblesignal contact with another person, so that communication is possible incase of emergency. If this practice is not followed there is potentialfor a seriously injured employee to be without help for an extended period.Motor noise is not an acceptable signal. This paragraph would not applyto operators of motor vehicles, watchmen and other jobs which, by theirnature, are single employee assignments. OSHA requests comments on thisproposed requirement. This paragraph clarifies existing provisions in the current OSHA pulpwoodlogging standard and is similar to provisions contained in the 1978 ANSIlogging standard and several State Plan state standards. In (e)(4)(ii), OSHA proposes that all employees be accounted for at theend of each work shift. The intent is to guard against injured workersbeing left alone in the woods. The current OSHA pulpwood logging standardrequires accounting for workers at the end of the day. OSHA believes itis more appropriate for employers to account for workers at the end oftheir work shift since some logging operations use more than one shiftof workers a day. The 1978 ANSI standard and the Oregon and Washingtonstate standards require accounting at the end of each shift. (See OregonAdmin. R. 437-80-020 and Wash. Admin. Code R. 296-54-507(3).) In (e)(4)(iii), OSHA proposes spacing and assignment of duties so thatthe actions of one employee do not endanger another. An example of thepossible danger would be when a faller is assigned to fell a tree whenother fallers, buckers or choker setters are nearby instead of schedulingsuch felling at a time when the other workers would not be endangered byfalling wood. This type of accident is often noted in OSHA accident reports.Although the OSHA pulpwood logging standard does not contain this provision,its precursor, the 1971 ANSI pulpwood standard; did so. The 1978 ANSI standardalso required all logging employers to space employees and assign dutiesso that the actions of one employee would not create hazards for otherpersonnel. OSHA believes that the adoption of this general performanceoriented provision is necessary to ensure careful prior planning of loggingoperations, so that the various activities of the loggers do not endangereach other. In (e)(4)(iv), OSHA proposes that portable fire extinguishers be providedwhere logging machines and vehicles are operated, as a precaution againstfire hazards created by machines, vehicles and fuel. Fire in the woodsposes a significant danger to loggers who could be trapped in the firearea. In (e)(4)(v), OSHA proposes that fuel must be stored and dispensed in accordancewith the General Industry standard for hazardous materials, 29 CFR Part1910, Subpart H. The non-pulpwood logging industry is already requiredto comply with the General Industry standard. The pulpwood logging standardcontained similar requirements. The requirement is included in the loggingstandard to stress that employees must comply with what OSHA believes areimportant safety practices. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also containedrequirements for safe storage and handling of fuel. In (e)(5), OSHA proposes 13 requirements meant to protect chain saw operatorsfrom injury. The BLS survey (Reference 1) found that 20 percent of theinjuries to loggers were caused by chain saws. Two-thirds of these accidentsoccurred when the saw kicked back. Most of the other injuries involvingchain saws occurred when workers fell on their saws. Over three-fourthsof those injured by chain saws were cutting with the saw when the injuryoccurred.In recent years there have been many improvements in chain saw safety dueto chainbrakes, bar tip guards, and bars and chains which reduce kickback.Protective chaps and pads of ballistic nylon or improved lightweight protectivematerials have further protected the operator. OSHA believes that properuse of improved chain saws and personal protective equipment; and compliancewith the proposed work practices will greatly improve the safety recordof chain saw operations. Based on the BLS survey, OSHA believes that manyof the accidents are caused by fatigue, inattention, haste to produce,or a combination of these factors. OSHA believes that the 13 proposed requirements,when reinforced by the standard's training provisions in (d)(1), (2) and(3), will lead to a better understanding of the safety standards and asignificant reduction in chain saw injuries. OSHA requests information about any data which demonstrate the successor failure of particular safety devices, chain design, bar design and/orprotective equipment in the improvement of operator safety. Several foreigncountries have mandated use of chainbrakes. OSHA requests information aboutany data or studies evaluating the effectiveness of chainbrakes in achievingsafer chainsaw operation in those countries. Some substantive proposed changes to the chain saw provisions of the currentOSHA standard are as follows: In (e)(5)(iii), OSHA proposes the specific requirement that chain sawsmust be fueled not less than 20 feet (6 m) from an open flame or otherpotential source of ignition. The proposed requirement is the same as therequirement in ANSI 03.1-1978 and is more specific than the very generalwording in the current OSHA andSection; 1910.266(c)(5)(iii). In (e)(5)(viii), OSHA proposes parameters governing the carrying of a runningchain saw. BLS Bulletin 2203 (Reference 1) states that of 222 instancesof injury by a chain saw, 28 were the result of falls, the second leadingcause of chain saw injury after kickbacks. Since an employee walking onthe job site has an increased chance of slipping or tripping and sincefalls onto a running chain saw lead to severe injuries, OSHA has proposedadoption of the 50-foot maximum carrying distance recommended in ANSI 03.1-1978for the carrying of a running saw. OSHA proposes further restricting thedistance a running saw may be carried if the terrain and other physicalfactors such as underbrush and slippery surfaces warrant such a precaution,as was required in ANSI 03.1-1978. OSHA believes that the current rule,permitting running chain saws to be carried from ``tree to tree'' inadequatelyaddresses the hazard since the distance between trees (which varies fromone work area to the next) bears little relationship to the factors influencingthe hazard, such as the distance the saw is carried, the slope of the terrain,and the amount of ground cover and debris. OSHA believes that a runningchain saw must never be carried more than fifty feet in the woods. Theneed for guidance in this area has been evident in questions and commentsOSHA has received. In (e)(5)(xiii), OSHA proposes deletion of the absolute requirement ofthe OSHA pulpwood logging standard that chain saw operators hold the sawwith both hands during operation. The proposed standard requires that afirm grip be used; however, it recognizes that some cutting requires briefreleases of one hand such as when a feller needs to place a wedge in thecut to keep it open. The 1978 ANSI standard recognizes the need for momentaryrelease of one hand in some situations. In (e)(6), OSHA proposes 18 requirements intended to protect personnelfrom hazards associated with stationary and mobile equipment such as mobileyarders, and mobile loaders. The large size, noise level and complexityof these machines all contribute to potential hazards to employees. Allof the provisions are in the OSHA pulpwood logging standard. Minor changesin wording have been made to clarify some of the provisions. Substantiveproposed changes to the current OSHA standard are discussed in the followingparagraphs: In (e)(6)(i), OSHA proposes continuing the pulpwood logging standard'srequirement that an operator's manual or set of operating instructionsbe with each machine. Operators unsure or unaware of safe operating procedurespose hazards to themselves and co-workers. OSHA feels that having the materialon the machine ensures its availability when needed. In (e)(6)(ii), OSHA intends to prevent the accumulation of any materialon walking and working surfaces which could lead to slipping and fallinginjuries or could ignite and cause a fire.In (e)(6)(ix), OSHA proposes the installation and use of seatbelts on alltractors and mobile equipment having roll-over protection. The provisionwould allow an exception to seatbelt use in the rare situation that useof the seatbelt would add to the jeopardy of the operator due to conditionsat a particular worksite. The State of Washington, for example, has a similarstandard and exception. Washington State would allow exceptions to seatbelt use when: (1) Working on or above some of the extremely steep slopeswhere logging activity does occur; (2) working or passing below steep slopes,particularly when other logging activity is occurring on or above the steepslope; and (3) jillpoke and sweeper hazards are present. The 1978 ANSIstandard recommended that seatbelts be worn loosely fitting so that theoperator had sufficient leeway to avoid a possible penetrating limb orbranch. Additional public comment is invited on seatbelt use. In (e)(6)(xiii), OSHA proposes prohibiting riders or observers at any timeon loads or on machines, unless seating and protection are provided equivalentto that provided the operator. This machine rider and observer prohibitionis a part of the OSHA pulpwood logging standard. OSHA requests commentand supporting information regarding whether the standard should containan exception to this prohibition to allow an observer on the machine fortraining purposes only, and under what conditions. In (e)(6)(xvi), (xvii) and (xviii), OSHA proposes certain requirementsfor operation and transit in the vicinity of electrical distribution andtransmission lines. Similar provisions exist in the 1978 ANSI logging standard,the OSHA Construction Safety Standards, andSection; 1926.550, and the OSHAGeneral Industry Safety Standards, Part 1910, Subpart N. In (e)(7), OSHA proposes continuation of the explosives handling and userequirements that have been included in andSection; 1910.109 and referencedby current andSection; 1910.266(c)(7) of the OSHA pulpwood logging standard.The extreme hazards to employees that exist wherever explosives are handledor used are well-known. The explicit statement is intended to aid employersand employees in recognizing the need for proper handling and use of explosives.<T3>Paragraph (f), </T3>``<T3>Equipment protective devices_stationary and mobile equipment</T3>.''In (f)(1), OSHA proposes 16 requirements concerning equipment protectivestructures. Operators of forestry equipment need protection from many hazards,including roll-over, falling trees, falling branches, rolling logs, snappinglines, whipping saplings and whipping branches. OSHA has based its proposedrequirements on several sources, including the current OSHA andSection; 1910.266,the 1978 ANSI 03.1 standard, and state safety standards. In (f)(1)(i) and (ii), OSHA proposes that employers must equip, and maintain,roll-over protective structures (ROPS) on every tractor, skidder, front-endloader, scraper, grader, dozer and mechanical falling device, if placedin service after the effective date of the standard. OSHA proposes thatthe ROPS shall be installed, tested and maintained in accordance with theSociety of Automotive Engineers recommended criteria set forth in SAE 1040c1979. The use of ROPS is not required in the current OSHA andSection; 1910.266.However, the value of ROPS_required in OSHA Construction Safety Standards,29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart W, and Agricultural Standards, 29 CFR Part 1928,Subpart C_has become well recognized as necessary protection for forestryequipment operators. Steep terrain, slippery or uneven ground, large loads,top-heavy equipment or loads, and other environmental conditions and workpractices present a danger of logging equipment rollover. ROPS will reducethe possibility that operators will be crushed in the event their machinerolls over. ROPS use has become a common requirement in state logging standards.In (f)(1)(iii), OSHA proposes that falling object protective structures(FOPS), be installed on all equipment which must have ROPS under (f)(1)(i)and, in addition, on swing yarders, log stackers and forklift trucks, ifplaced in service after the effective date of the standard. OSHA proposesthat the FOPS be installed, tested and maintained in accordance with theSociety of Automotive Engineers performance criteria published in SAE J231JAN 81. This proposed requirement addresses hazards posed to equipmentoperators by falling trees and limbs, snapping winch lines and other fallingobjects. The proposed provision clarifies the requirements posed by andSection;1910.266(d)(2) of the current pulpwood logging standard. OSHA has found that ROPS and FOPS are standard features on logging machinesbeing manufactured at the present time. OSHA believes that many loggingmachines in current use, however, are not fitted with such safety features.OSHA requests comment on the costs to retrofit these older machines withROPS and FOPS and whether it is feasible to do so. In (f)(1)(iv), OSHA proposes that vehicles equipped with ROPS or FOPS asrequired in (i) or (iii) also comply with the Society of Automotive Engineerscriteria on limitation on deflection, SAE J397b 1979. Deflection limitsensure that when ROPS/FOPS hit a hard surface they will retain their capabilityto withstand subsequent impacts.The remaining proposed provisions of (f)(1) are contained in OSHA's pulpwoodlogging standard, in ANSI's 1978 logging standard, or both. Two newly proposedprovisions which were in the 1978 ANSI standard are (f)(1)(xv) and (xvi).Proposed paragraph (xv) clarifies that transparent material, such as safetyglass, that is used in equipment must be replaced when it is cracked orbroken, or when vision is obscured due to scratches. Proposed paragraph(xvi) addresses the obvious hazards of breaking lines falling on workersoperating equipment during high lead and skyline yarding operations byrequiring sheds or roofs over such equipment to be sufficiently strongto withstand the force of such breaking lines. It is also noted that in(f)(1)(vii), OSHA proposes that the lower portion of the cab be completelyenclosed with solid material, except at entrances, to prevent the operatorfrom being injured by obstacles entering the cab. OSHA solicits informationon whether the use of material that is not solid, such as wire mesh, canadequately provide this protection. In (f)(2), OSHA proposes that steps, ladders, handholds, catwalks, or railingsbe provided where needed for mounting and maintenance purposes. This standardwill protect against slips and falls by the operator or maintenance personnel.Although the OSHA pulpwood logging standard does not address this hazard,the 1971 ANSI standard did. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also had sucha provision and, like the proposal, required access equipment to be providedin accordance with the Society of Automotive Engineers J185 standard. In (f)(3), OSHA proposes that exposed moving elements such as shafts, pulleys,belts, conveyors, and gears be guarded in accordance with Part 1910, SubpartO. This provision is not new for the logging industry and provides basicprotection from well-recognized hazards. Even though the necessity formachine guarding is not unique to the logging industry, the OSHA pulpwoodlogging standard has such a provision. In the proposed standard the provisionis included as a reminder that general industry machine guarding requirementscontinue to apply to logging. Paragraph (f)(4) of the proposal which is listed as ``reserved,'' is intendedto provide coverage of hazards related to the control of hazardous energysources, usually referred to as ``lockout/tagout.'' Logging operationsare already included within the scope of OSHA's proposed generic lockout/tagoutstandard, which was published on April 29, 1988 (53 FR 15496). (A completediscussion of the reasons for the proposed lockout/tagout standard, togetherwith a summary and explanation of the provisions of that proposal, is containedin the April 29 <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, and is incorporated by reference intothis preamble.) The Agency intends that the generic rule apply to loggingoperations, and is proposing to reference that rule in the final loggingstandard when both are issued as final rules. However, because the controlof hazardous energy is an important consideration in logging operations,OSHA wishes to assure that the logging standard contains the kind of lockout/tagoutcoverage provided by the generic standard, even if the final. logging standardis issued before the generic lockout/tagout standard. Accordingly, OSHAis reserving paragraph (f)(4) for use, if necessary, to incorporate theproposed generic lockout/tagout provisions directly into the logging standard.If the rulemaking on the generic standard is not completed before the loggingstandard becomes a final rule, OSHA intends to place the proposed lockout/tagoutprocedures from the generic rule within the text of the final logging standard.These procedures would be removed from the logging standard when the genericlockout/tagout standard is published. At that time, the generic rule wouldcover logging as part of its overall coverage of general industry. OSHAinvites comments and data on the applicablity of the proposed generic lockout/tagoutstandard to logging operations. In (f)(5), OSHA proposes three basic requirements for use of guylines.Many different hazardous situations are presented in the use of guylines.Great care is necessary in their use to prevent guyline or anchor failuredue to the imposed load. The first two requirements, paragraphs (f)(5)(i)and (f)(5)(ii), are also in the current OSHA pulpwood standard. In thethird, (f)(5)(iii), OSHA has rewritten the regulation concerning guylineanchors for clarity and to allow the use of standing trees as anchors whenthe trees are tied back to other anchors, and where there is no dangerthat any part of the tree will enter the work area in case of failure.In (f)(6), OSHA proposes that stability, boom reliability, and inspectionprocedures for truck and crawler mounted rigid boom cranes and yardersbe in accordance with American National Standards Institute standards ANSIB30.2-1983 and ANSI B30.5-1982_the most up-to-date nationally recognizedvoluntary safety standards for these machines. Both the OSHA pulpwood standardand general industry standards require compliance with older ANSI standardsfor crane and derrick stability and reliability criteria. In (f)(7), OSHA proposes four provisions concerning exhaust pipes to protectemployees from the hazards of noise, hot gases, hot surfaces, and firescaused by sparks in the exhaust. The wording has been expanded from thecurrent rule's simple requirement that mufflers provided by the manufactureror their equivalent shall be in place at all times the machine is in operation.In (f)(8), OSHA proposes four provisions governing brakes. The terrainoften encountered in logging makes proper brakes an especially importantsafety consideration. Brake provisions are included in state standardsand the ANSI 03.1-1978 standard.In (f)(8)(i), OSHA proposes a performance standard requiring that brakeshold a machine and its maximum intended load on the grades over which itis being operated.In (f)(8)(ii), OSHA would require a secondary braking system which willwork in any direction of travel and is not dependent on engine operation.In (f)(8)(iii), OSHA proposes that the braking system be kept in good repair.The intent of this regulation is to maintain the effectiveness of the brakingsystem by increasing awareness of the importance of brake maintenance andrepair. In (f)(8)(iv), OSHA would require a parking brake or a locking device tohold the service brakes in the applied position. <T3>Paragraph (g), Tree harvesting. </T3>In this paragraph OSHA proposesnumerous provisions intended to protect employees from hazards during theentire tree harvesting sequence. In (g)(1), OSHA proposes nine provisions intended to protect employeesfrom hazards generally related to felling activities. According to theBLS Survey, 23 percent of the injuries take place during the felling operation.In (g)(1)(i), OSHA proposes assignment of work areas at a separation distanceof at least twice the height of the trees being felled. Similar requirementsexist in state standards and the 1978 ANSI standard. It is OSHA's intentto protect employees from misdirected trees, additional trees knocked downinadvertently, and/or falling dislodged portions of trees. OSHA also proposesa greater distance between work areas on slopes because of increased difficultyin directional felling and the added danger of being struck by a rollingor sliding felled tree. In (g)(1)(ii), OSHA proposes a new requirement that skidders and prehaulersnot be operated in the immediate felling area while manual felling activityis in progress. OSHA is concerned that the activity of these machines couldexpose the fellers to hazards by dislodging trees or portions of trees,and the felling activity could endanger the machine operators. In (g)(1)(iii), OSHA proposes the marking and grounding of lodged treesusing mechanical or other safe techniques before any work is continuedwithin two tree lengths. It is OSHA's intent to protect employees fromhazards caused by the unpredictable stability of a lodged tree. Such atree could suddenly fall and cause other trees and branches to fall. In (g)(1)(iv), OSHA proposes that other employees not approach a fellercloser than twice the height of trees being felled until the feller hasacknowledged that it is safe to do so. Because of the noise involved, otheremployees are likely to be well aware of felling activity while the felleroften may not be aware of approaching employees. OSHA believes that thesafest procedure is for other employees to wait until they can get thefeller's attention and approval. In (g)(1)(v), OSHA proposes a new requirement that employees remain clearof any mechanical felling operation. OSHA believes that employees walkingor working near a mechanical feller are in danger because the operatoroften does not know of their approach. The employees are exposed to thehazard presented by the operating machine and the usual hazards of fallingtrees and branches. In (g)(1)(vi), OSHA proposes a general requirement that trees shall notbe felled in a manner that would endanger any person, or strike any line(including power lines), or fall on equipment. A similar provision wasincluded in ANSI 03.1-1978. In (g)(1)(vii), OSHA proposes that because of the hazards presented bypower lines, the power company shall be notified immediately if a treedoes make contact with any power line, and all personnel shall remain clearof the area until the power company advises that conditions are safe. In (g)(1)(viii), OSHA proposes that felling activity on sloping terrainbe kept uphill from, or on the same level as, previously felled trees.It is OSHA's intent to protect the fellers from sliding and rolling ofthe trees felled previously. In (g)(1)(ix), OSHA proposes a new requirement that fellers consult withtheir immediate supervisor before beginning to cut when the felling activityitself is unsually hazardous. This general performance-oriented provisionaddresses particularly hazardous felling, such as when trees are very large,or when their lean, location or structure make it difficult and dangerousto fell the tree in the desired direction. OSHA believes the increasedconsultation and supervision will minimize the hazards to loggers. In (g)(2), OSHA proposes six requirements intended to protect employeesengaged in manual felling. Proposed changes to the current pulpwood loggingstandard follow. In (g)(2)(i), OSHA proposes continuing the pulpwood standard's requirementthat fellers plan, and clear as necessary, a retreat path before cuttingis started. In addition, OSHA proposes the requirement that, where theterrain and tree growth make it feasible, the retreat path shall extendback and diagonally to the rear of the expected falling line. This additionalrequirement was included in ANSI 03.1-1978. In (g)(2)(iii), OSHA proposes that undercuts be required, and that theybe of the necessary size to guide the falling tree in the desired directionof fall, with a minimum possibility of splitting. It is OSHA's intent toprotect the feller from the hazards of a poorly directed or split tree.Performance wording is used because of the many different conditions thatcan exist. ANSI 03.1-1978 adopted such language. In (g)(2)(iv), OSHA proposes that a backcut allow for sufficient hingewood to guide the tree and prevent it from prematurely slipping or twistingoff the stump. OSHA's intent is to protect the feller from the hazard ofa misdirected tree. ANSI 03.1-1978 adopted this provision. In (g)(2)(v), OSHA proposes that the backcut be above the horizontal cutof the undercut. It is OSHA's intent to protect the feller from a kickbackof the falling tree from the stump, which generally would be more likelyto occur if the backcut was lower. Performance wording is used becauseof the many different conditions that can exist. ANSI 03.1-1978 adoptedsuch language. In (g)(2)(vi), OSHA proposes to require chain saws to be either at idleor shut off before a feller starts his retreat. OSHA believes that idlingthe saw is at least as effective in preventing serious injuries from chainsaw lacerations as complete engine stoppage because the chain is not beingdriven. In (g)(3), OSHA proposes four requirements concerned with the hazards ofthe bucking operation. The BLS Survey demonstrated that 12 percent of thelogging injuries occurred while bucking. The proposed requirements addressthe hazards presented by log movement on slopes, by spring poles and treesunder stress, by windthrown timber and by yarded trees. The provision addressingwindthrown timber has been added to the standard because its unplannedlie multiplies the dangers presented to buckers by rolling and shiftingtrees. Unstable root wads present additional hazards when cut away fromthe fallen trees.The only other proposed change to the current OSHA standard's bucking provisionsconcerns the location and placement of trees yarded to a bucking site.The proposal clarifies that the yarded trees must be safely located, suchas being far enough from other operations so as not to be endangered bythem, and that the trees shall be placed in an orderly manner so that theyare stable when worked on. In (g)(4), OSHA proposes precautions to protect employees performing limbingoperations from the hazards of cutting spring poles and limbs under stress.There is danger to the employee due to the release of the stress when alimb is cut. In (g)(5), OSHA proposes requirements to protect employees from the hazardsof mechanical debarking and delimbing operations. The hazards are thosenormally associated with moving parts and with flying materials such aschips, bark, and limbs. In (g)(6), OSHA proposes 11 requirements to protect employees from thehazards of skidding, forwarding and yarding. Several provisions in thecurrent pulpwood logging standard are not included in this proposal becauseOSHA believes they are outdated or unnecessarily rigid. Proposed changesto current provisions are described below. In (g)(6)(ii), OSHA proposes that while hooking or unhooking chokers, workerschoose the safest approach route which is the up-hill side or end of thelog unless it is not feasible to do so or unless the log is securely blockedto prevent rolling or swinging. Choker setters and chasers (those who unhookchokers), are subject to many of the same hazards as fallers, limbers,and buckers; the primary dangers being shifting logs, falling wood, andunsafe footing. The BLS Survey found that choker setting or hooking upa ``turn'' of logs comprised the third most dangerous logging operation,accounting for 14 percent of the injuries. Another five percent of theinjuries surveyed were attributed to workers unhooking choker cables. In (g)(6)(iv), OSHA proposes to amend the current pulpwood logging standard'srigid requirement that yarding equipment be positioned during winchingso that the winch line is in alignment with the long axis of the machine.OSHA recognizes that exact alignment is not always possible in the woods.OSHA proposes that the winch line must be as near in alignment with thelong axis of the machine as possible, unless the machine is designed tobe used under other conditions of alignment. In (g)(6)(vi), OSHA proposes that yarding lines not be moved unless thesignal to do so is clearly understood. A method of confirming the signalwhen in doubt is included. OSHA believes that this communication is veryimportant. The unexpected movement of yarding lines can subject employeesto being caught in or struck by the lines, carriages, or chokers and/orlogs. Similar requirements are found in state standards and the ANSI 03.1-1978consensus standard. In (g)(6)(vii), OSHA proposes the examination of spar trees for defectssuch as rot or splits which may weaken the tree and make it unsuitablefor rigging. Similar requirements appear in state standards and in theANSI 03.1-1978 national consensus standard. In (g)(6)(viii), OSHA proposes that unstable trees and spars be guyed forstability. Similar requirements appear in state standards and in the ANSI03.1-1978 national consensus standard. The requirement does not apply toyarding equipment which is designed for guyless operation. In (g)(6)(xi), OSHA proposes basic requirements for towed equipment, suchas skid pans, pallets, arches, and trailers, to ensure safe turning andcontrol of the equipment. Unnecessary elementary design requirements inthe current standard such as requiring yarders to have the ability to securelyretain towed equipment have been dropped. Requirements concerning the useof animals to tow have been dropped since animals are seldom used for thispurpose today. In (g)(7), OSHA proposes four requirements intended to protect employeesduring transportation. In (g)(7)(i), OSHA proposes that all drivers have a valid operator's licensefor the class of vehicle being operated. OSHA believes that compliancewith this requirement would ensure that the operator has met the necessaryqualifications and has operated in a manner responsible enough to maintainhis or her license.In (g)(7)(ii), OSHA proposes that flammable liquids not be transportedin driver compartments nor in occupied passenger compartments. Flammableliquids present the hazards of fire and explosion, and would be particularlydangerous for employees in these compartments. ANSI 03.1-1978 also requiredthat flammable liquids be transported outside these compartments. In (g)(7)(iii) OSHA proposes to continue the current requirement that allseats in personnel carriers be securely fastened to the vehicle. In (g)(7)(iv), OSHA proposes to add the requirement that mounting stepsand handholds be provided on personnel transport vehicles to address theobvious hazards presented by slips and falls from this equipment. A similarrequirement appeared in ANSI 03.1-1978. In (g)(7)(v) OSHA proposes a new requirement that personnel transportationvehicles have seat belts for drivers and that drivers shall use them. Seatbelts will help prevent injuries to drivers involved in vehicle accidents.In addition, seat belts will help prevent accidents by keeping the driverfirmly planted in his seat during travel to and from logging operationson roads that are often steep, narrow, and rough. In (g)(8), OSHA proposes the basic requirements that truck drivers ensurethat load binders are tight before moving the load, and that they checkand tighten the binders as necessary while in transit. OSHA believes that,while the initial tightening of the binder may secure the load, travelmotion, particularly off highway, may cause the load to work loose andresult in somewhat slack binding. The checking and tightening will helpprevent truck accidents. A similar requirement was revoked from the OSHApulpwood standard in 1978 (43 FR 49571, October 24, 1978), because it wasmistakenly believed to be for the general protection of the public. However,OSHA has received several comments supporting the requirement as providingprotection for drivers. A similar provision was also in ANSI 03.1-1978.In (g)(9), OSHA proposes eight requirements intended to protect employeesinvolved in loading and unloading operations. The requirements are basedon those in various state logging standards_ANSI 03.1-1971, ANSI 03.1-1978,and the current provisions of andSection; 1910.266. In the proposal, theseparate manual loading and machine loading requirements of the currentandSection; 1910.266 have been replaced by combined loading and unloadingrequirements. Changes and additions to the current OSHA pulpwood loggingstandard are discussed in the following paragraphs. In (g)(9)(iii), OSHA proposes that drivers not remain in the truck cabduring loading or unloading unless the employer demonstrates that the driverspresence in the cab is necessary as part of the loading and unloading processand the cab and associated guards offer adequate protection from logs shiftingor falling onto the cab. This provides for the driver's safety during thelog handling operation. The 1978 ANSI standard had a similar provision.In (g)(9)(iv), OSHA proposes that logs and bolts be placed on transportvehicles so that they can be properly secured. It is OSHA's intent to protectemployees from the hazards of loads which may move because of impropersecuring caused by haphazard loading. In (g)(9)(vi), OSHA proposes that stakes and chocks which are used fortripping shall be constructed in such a manner that the tripping mechanismthat releases the stakes or chocks is activated on the side of the loadopposite the release. This is intended to protect employees from the hazardspresented by sudden log movement upon release by isolating the employeefrom moving logs. In (g)(9)(vii), OSHA proposes that a sufficient number of binders be leftin place over each peak log to secure all logs until after the unloadinglines or other equivalent protection are in place. This requirement isintended to protect employees from sudden movement of the load. In (g)(9)(viii), OSHA proposes that binders be released only from the sideon which the unloader operates, except when released by remote controldevices, or when the person making a release is protected by racks or stanchionsor other equivalent means. This requirement is intended to ensure thatthe person making the release is in a safe location and is not endangeredby movement of the load. In (g)(10), OSHA proposes that piles and decks be located and constructedso as to provide a safe working area around them. OSHA believes that awell planned and implemented work area can prevent the occurrence of manyaccidents. In (g)(11), OSHA proposes three requirements for chippers in order to keepemployees away from the dangerous moving drums, discs, knives and blowerblades. The moving chipper mechanism presents significant hazards, andemployees need protection from contact with the mechanism. The only proposedrequirement not contained in the current rule is a lockout provision whichis added to ensure that employees do not get caught in the infeed whenthey must work on that mechanism. A similar requirement appears in ANSI03.1-1978. In (g)(12), OSHA proposes new requirements concerning signaling and signalequipment. Such requirements are found in ANSI 03.1-1978 and are commonin state standards. In (g)(12)(i), OSHA proposes that hand or audible signals be utilized wheneverexcessive noise, distance, restricted visibility, or other factors preventclear understanding of normal voice communciation between employees. Localor regionally recognized signals may be used. OSHA believes that any attemptto replace local or regionally recognized signals with a national systemwhich is not locally recognized could lead to confusion and endanger employees.In (g)(12)(ii), OSHA proposes that, except in emergencies, only designatedpersons shall give signals. OSHA believes that any other practice couldalso cause confusion and endanger employees. <T3>Roads and Trails. </T3>Provisions of the current pulpwood logging standardwhich specifically apply to the construction of roads and trails, andSection;1910.266(e)(15)-(19), have not been included in the proposed standard.Similar provisions were not continued in ANSI 03.1-1978 when it was publishedas a revision which expanded ANSI 03.1-1971 to include all logging. OSHAConstruction Standards would apply to the road and trail building process.Provisions in the current pulpwood logging standard such as those coveringtrees and snags which may fall onto roads and trails are covered elsewherein the proposed standard. Road and trail characteristics are also subjectto a wide variety of state and local controls; and regulations of otherFederal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service which render additionalspecific OSHA regulations unnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI.

Regulatory Impact Assessment </ITAG>A Preliminary Regulatory Impact Assessment (PRIA) has been prepared byOSHA in compliance with Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory FlexibilityAct of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The data for this assessment were providedby a February 1986 report by Centaur Associates, Inc., entitled, ``EconomicImpact Study of the Logging Industry.'' All estimates in this PRIA arein 1985 dollars. The complete OSHA PRIA is available for inspection andcopying at the OSHA Docket Office, Room N-3670, 200 Constitution Avenue,NW., Washington, DC 20210. Affected Industries and Workers For purposes of analysis, the U.S. was divided in four relevant geographicalregions_the North, the South, the Rocky Mountains, and the Pacific Coast.The proposed rule will affect approximately 11,700 establishments and 69,000loggers. This is somewhat of an underestimate for reasons explained indetail in the PRIA. (About 6,200 establishments and 41,600 workers arecovered under the current OSHA pulpwood standard and the six state-plan-statelogging standards.) These affected workers include fellers and buckers,who cut the trees; skidder yarder operators, choker setters, and chasers,who are responsible for delivering a felled tree to the side of a road;and loader operators and truck drivers, who load the trees onto trucksfor transport to a mill. Although all stages of logging present hazardsto workers, the loggers most at risk are those who work out in the open,rather than those who operate mechanical harvesting equipment and are protectedby enclosed cabs. Assessment of the Nonregulatory Environment The private market fails to provide an adequate level of safety for loggers.The number and severity of accidents related to this industry is high.Tort liability rarely applies in these accidents and the Workers' Compensationsystem suffers from several defects that seriously reduce its effectivenessin providing incentives for logging firms to create safe work places. OSHA,therefore, believes the proposed standard is the best mechanism to reducerisk in a manner optimal to society. Technological Feasibility The proposed work practices and training provisions, as well as personalprotective equipment and protective devices on equipment, are feasible.Many establishments in the logging industry are currently providing thetraining and personal protective equipment, and are operating under thesame work practices, as those required by the proposed standard. OSHA hasdetermined that numerous firms of all sizes are already in compliance withmost of the provisions of the proposed standard, and, therefore, the promulgationof this expanded and revised standard is technologically feasible. Costs of Compliance The costs of compliance for the proposed standard can be separated intotwo components. Baseline I represents current industry practices and isused for estimating the cost of coming into compliance with current standards(i.e., the current OSHA pulpwood standard or the six state logging standards).This amount is $1.3 million per year and is incurred by establishmentsin the six state-plan-states with logging standards and by the pulpwoodlogging establishments in the remaining 44 states and jurisdictions subjectonly to the OSHA pulpwood standard. Baseline II assumes compliance withthe current standards and is used to measure the  additional cost to affectedfirms to comply with the proposed OSHA standard. This cost is $2.6 millionper year and is incurred to a greater or lesser extent by all U.S. loggingfirms, including those nonpulpwood logging firms not currently coveredby a standard. The total cost (Baseline I plus Baseline II) is $3.9 millionper year in 1985 dollars and represents the cost for all firms to complyfully with the proposed standard. These costs are annual amounts in 1985 dollars. Personal protective equipmentaccounts for 71 percent of the total cost. Training and providing operators'manuals and written procedures for disabling hazardous energy lockout/tagoutaccount for 20 percent, 2 percent, and 7 percent, respectively. The costassociated with requiring lockout/tagout procedures in the logging industryhas already been included in the preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysisfor the generic rule proposed for all general industry on April 29, 1988(53 FR 15496). This cost is also provided here because OSHA intends toinclude the proposed generic lockout/tagout provisions in the final loggingstandard if necessary, i.e.; if the logging standard is issued before thegeneric rule is promulgated.Benefits Injury rates in the logging industry are high. In 1986, there were 18.9injuries per 100 workers in logging versus 7.7 injuries per 100 workersfor the entire private sector and an injury incident rate of 10.2 per 100workers  for manufacturing as a whole. Lost workday rates are especiallyhigh, indicating that most logging accidents are severe. There were approximately89 fatalities, 8,374 lost workday cases, and 4,231 non-lost workday casesin the logging industry in 1986. Logging is inherently dangerous because of treacherous work conditionsnot controllable by work practices or the use of personal protective equipment.The proposed standard, however, is expected to significantly mitigate andreduce the historically high incidence of death and injury due to treacherousterrain, unexpected and quickly changing weather conditions, the naturaldiversity of trees that are being felled, and the innumerable situations,where even a momentary lapse of concentration can produce crippling injuriesand death. The estimated benefits of full compliance with the current standards arean annual reduction of 10 fatalities, 955 lost workday cases, and 482 non-lostworkday cases. Compliance with the proposed standard is expected to reduceaccidents further, thereby resulting in first-year reductions of 8 fatalities,571 lost workday cases, and 288 non-lost workday cases. Because of theexpected increasing effectiveness of the training provisions, it is estimatedthat in the fifth year the proposal will result in a reduction of 14 fatalities,1,073 lost workday injuries, and 542 nonlost workday injuries. This reductioncan be attributed to the requirements for recurrent training of workers,the wearing of seatbelts when operating mobile equipment and the use ofballistic nylon protection for chain saw operators. Based solely on thefatalities avoided, this would translate into a cost per fatality avoidedof $130,000 for coming into compliance with the existing standard and $186,000per additional fatality avoided by the proposed standard upon full effectivenessof the training provision. Economic Impact of the Proposed Standard The projected economic impact of the proposed standard is small. The costof full compliance with the proposed standard represents only 0.05 percentof the 1986 value of shipments for this industry. These costs representa relatively insignificant amount of total shipments. An influx of Canadiansoftwood has caused lower lumber prices and reduced timber production inthe past several years. However, the Canadian Government recently imposeda 15 percent export tax on Canadian lumber. This is expected to have apositive effect on the price of lumber in the U.S. Some firms will bear more of the compliance costs than others. The annualcost per firm ranges from $27 in California, where firms are at a highlevel of compliance with their own state standard, to $452 in the South.Based on these estimates, OSHA has concluded that the economic impact ofthe proposed standard would not threaten the stability or profitabilityof the logging industry or of any firm within the industry. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Certification </ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Assistant Secretaryhad made a preliminary assessment of the impact of the proposed rule onsmall entities. The estimated compliance costs for small firms (in thiscase, those employing fewer than 20 workers) will be relatively higherthan the cost for large firms (those employing more than 20 workers). Ascompliance costs for all firms covered under the proposed standard, however,would be very small compared with net income, the Agency does not anticipatea significant impact on small firms. <ITAG tagnum="84">IX. International Trade </ITAG>Based on its economic analysis, OSHA has determined that neither the GrossNational Product (GNP), the level of international trade, the price ofconsumer goods, nor the level of employment would be significantly affected.<ITAG tagnum="85">X. Environmental Impact Assessment_Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The proposed revisions have been reviewed in accordance with the requirementsof the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321et seq.) the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)(40 CFR Part 1500), and the Department of Labor's (DOL's) NEPA Procedures(29 CFR Part 11). As a result of this review, the Assistant Secretary forOSHA has determined that the proposed rule will have no significant environmentalimpact. The proposed provisions focus on training, work practices, personal protectiveequipment, and protective devices on equipment in order to reduce workerfatalities and injuries. In general, these provisions do not impact onair, water, or soil quality, plant or animal life, the use of land, orother aspects of the environment. The proposed revisions are consideredexcluded actions under Subpart B, Section 11.10 of the DOL NEPA regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Paperwork Reduction </ITAG>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501et seq.), and the regulations issued pursuant thereto (5 CFR Part 1320),OSHA certifies that it has submitted the information collection requirementscontained in this proposed revision to its current standards to the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of thatAct. Comments on these information collection requirements may be submittedby interested parties to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairsof OMB, Attention: Desk Officer of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,726 Jackson Place, NW., Washington, DC 20503. OSHA requests that copiesof such comments also be submitted to the OSHA rulemaking docket, at theaddress set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="84">XII. Public Reporting Burden </ITAG>Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 10 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Officeof Information Management, Department of Labor, Room N-1301, 200 ConstitutionAvenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210; and to the Office of Management andBudget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1218-AA52), Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">XIII. Federalism </ITAG>This proposed standard has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), regarding Federalism. This Orderrequires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting Statepolicy options, consult with States prior to taking any actions that wouldrestrict State policy options, and take such actions only when there isclear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of nationalscope. The Order provides for preemption of State law only if there isa clear Congressional intent for the agency to do so. Any such preemptionis to be limited to the extent possible.Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expressesCongress' clear intent to preempt State laws relating to issues with respectto which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety or health standards.Under the OSH Act a State can avoid preemption only if it submits, andobtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of such standardsand their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developedby such Plan-States must, among other things, be at least as effectivein providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment asthe Federal standards. The Federally proposed logging standard is drafted so that loggers in everyState would be protected by general, performance-oriented standards. Tothe extent that there are State or regional peculiarities caused by thetypes of timber to be logged, the terrain, the climate or other factors,States with occupational safety and health plans approved under section18 of the OSH Act would be able to develop their own State standards todeal with any special problems. Moreover, the performance nature of thisproposed standard, of and by itself, allows for flexibility by States andloggers to provide as much safety as possible using varying methods consonantwith conditions in each State. In short, there is a clear national problem related to occupational safetyand health in the logging industry. While the individual States, if allacted, might be able collectively to deal with the safety problems involved,most have not elected to do so in the seventeen years since the enactmentof the OSH Act. Those States which have elected to participate under section18 of the OSH Act would not be preempted by this proposed regulation andwould be able to deal with special, local conditions within the frameworkprovided by this performance-oriented standard while ensuring that theirstandards are at least as effective as the Federal standard. State commentsare invited on this proposal and will be fully considered prior to promulgationof a final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">XIV. State Plan Standards </ITAG>The 25 States with their own OSHA approved occupational safety and healthplans must adopt a comparable standard within six months of the publicationdate of the final standard. These States are: Alaska, Arizona, California,Connecticut (for State and local government employees only), Hawaii, Indiana,Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, NewYork (for State and local government employees only), North Carolina, Oregon,Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, VirginIslands, Washington, and Wyoming. Until such time as a State standard ispromulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance,as appropriate, in these States. <ITAG tagnum="84">XV. Public Participation </ITAG>Interested persons are requested to submit written data, views and argumentsconcerning this proposal. These comments must be postmarked by July 31,1989, and submitted in quadruplicate to the Docket Officer, Docket No.S-048, Room N-3670, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue,NW., Washington, DC 20210. Written submissions should identify the specific provisions of the proposalwhich are addressed, and specific recommendations are encouraged on eachissue. All written comments received within the specified comment period willbe made a part of the record and will be available for public inspectionand copying at the above Docket Office address. Additionally, under section 6(b)(3) of the OSHA Act and 29 CFR 1911.11,interested persons may file objections to the proposal and request an informalhearing. The objections and hearing requests should be submitted in quadruplicateto the Docket Office at the above address and must comply with the followingconditions: 1. The objection must include the name and address of the objector; 2. The objections must be postmarked by July 31, 1989. 3. The objections must specify with particularity the provisions of theproposed rule to which objection is taken and must state the grounds therefor;4. Each objection must be separately stated and numbered; and 5. The objections must be accompanied by a detailed summary of the evidenceproposed to be adduced at the requested hearing. Interested persons who have objections to various provisions or have changesto recommend may of course make these objections or recommendations intheir comments and OSHA will fully consider them. There is only need tofile formal ``objections'' separately if the interested person requestsa public hearing. OSHA recognizes that there may be interested persons who, through theirknowledge of safety or their experience in the operations involved, wouldwish to endorse or support certain provisions in the standard. OSHA welcomessuch supportive comments, including any pertinent accident data or costinformation which may be available, in order that the record of this rulemakingwill present a balanced picture of the public response on the issues involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 1910 </ITAG>Chain saw, Forestry, Harvesting, Incorporation by reference, Logging, Occupationalsafety and health, Pulpwood timber, Safety, Training. <ITAG tagnum="84">Authority </ITAG>This document was prepared under the direction of Alan C.
