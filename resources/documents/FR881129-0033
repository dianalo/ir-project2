The standards proposed for revision regulatethe design, availability, and use of welding, cutting, and heating equipmentas well as safe work practices to be employed when such equipment is utilizedin shipyards.The existing shipyard employment standards (29 CFR Part 1915) apply toshipbuilding, ship repairing, and shipbreaking operations and related employments.However, the present standards in Part 1915 are not comprehensive in theircoverage of shipyard hazards, and are supplemented by the general industrystandards (29 CFR Part 1910) as necessary to provide complete coveragefor all the hazards encountered in shipyards. This document is one of aseries of proposals which are intended to revise Part 1915 to provide comprehensivecoverage of shipyard employment solely within that part. This action will consolidate and update the shipyard welding, cutting,and heating standards and the appropriate general industry welding, cutting,and heating standards into a single, comprehensive subpart of Part 1915that would apply to all activities and areas in shipyards (except constructionactivities covered by Part 1926). The proposed provisions will delete manyexisting specification provisions which currently limit employer innovation,and where appropriate, use performance-oriented provisions to address thehazards of welding, cutting, and heating operations as a part of vesselconstruction, as well as general maintenance around the shipyard facility.The specific topic of welding, cutting, and heating is currently addressedin Subpart D of the current Shipyard Employment Standards. This proposalwould reorganize the rules into a more logical grouping of topics, reducethe number of sections from seven to five, and continue to locate the welding,cutting, and heating sections in Subpart D.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments on this proposed rulemaking must be postmarkedby February 27, 1989.

Moore, Office of Fire Protection Engineeringand Systems Safety Standards, Occupational Safety and Health Administration.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>In May 1971, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) underauthority granted by section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and HealthAct of 1970 (84 Stat. 1590, 29 U.S.C. 655), adopted established Federalstandards issued under section 41 of the Longshore and Harbor Workers'Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 941), as standards applicable to ship repairing(29 CFR Part 1915), shipbuilding (29 CFR Part 1916), and shipbreaking (29CFR Part 1917) operations. In addition, OSHA adopted other Federal standardsand national consensus standards as general industry standards (29 CFRPart 1910) and construction industry standards (29 CFR Part 1926) whichwere made applicable to hazards and working conditions not specificallycovered in Part 1915, 1916, or 1917. On April 20, 1982, the ship repairing,shipbuilding, and shipbreaking standards were consolidated into one Part1915 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, and titled ``OccupationalSafety and Health Standards for Shipyard Employment'' (47 FR 16984). Theconsolidation eliminated duplicate and overlapping provisions, but didnot alter substantive requirements. The consolidation did not affect theapplicability of the general industry standards in 29 CFR Part 1910 tohazards or conditions in shipyard employment which were not specificallyaddressed in the consolidated Part 1915 (See 29 CFR 1910.5(c)). In 1982, the Shipbuilders Council of America and the American WaterwaysShipyard Conference requested OSHA to identify the specific applicableprovisions of the general industry standards which apply to shipyards,and consolidate them with the existing Part 1915 provisions into a singleset of shipyard employment standards. OSHA has determined that such consolidationis appropriate. This and other proposed rulemakings will eventually incorporateall applicable Part 1910 provisions into the existing organization of Part1915. The present Part 1915 organizational format, which is already familiarto present users of the shipyard standards, provides a logical groupingof related provisions based on the type of work activity, hazard, or equipmentinvolved. However, when a regrouping of topics would facilitate understandingof the rules, or when applicable Part 1910 provisions have no counterpartin the existing Part 1915 structure, the proposals would create new subpartsor subpart headings in Part 1915. In addition to consolidating the provisions of Part 1910 and Part 1915,OSHA will propose to revise the consolidated provisions as appropriate.OSHA has not substantively revised many of the current provisions in theseParts since they were promulgated in 1971. OSHA believes some provisionsneed to be revised to reflect technological advances. Other provisionsneed to be revised because they are based on national consensus standardsissued prior to 1971, and do not reflect the revisions made since thattime. As the provisions are consolidated, all such revised consensus standardswill be reviewed, and OSHA's provisions revised as necessary to effectuatethe purposes of the standard and the OSH Act. Where practical, all currentincorporations by reference of national consensus standards and other materialswill be deleted by the proposed standards, and the text of all such requirementswill be proposed for inclusion in the body of the proposed standards, ortheir appendices. This approach is intended to assist employers in determiningwhat duties and obligations are imposed by a provision by minimizing theneed to refer to documents outside Part 1915. OSHA will also use the consolidationproject to replace specification requirements with performance-orientedrequirements, where it is known that there is more than one way to providesafety equivalent to that provided by the present specification requirements.Specification requirements would be used only where necessary to set appropriatelimits and to clarify duties and obligations. The revisions of the shipyard employment standards will be coordinatedwith efforts to revise parallel provisions in the construction and generalindustry standards, so that consistent coverage of hazards which are encounteredin these industry sectors can be provided. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary and Explanation</ITAG>In accordance with paragraph 6(b)(8) of the Occupational Safety and HealthAct of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655), the agency has reviewed the various nationalconsensus standards that cover working conditions addressed in this proposal.Where appropriate, OSHA has incorporated provisions from those nationalconsensus standards as part of the proposal. OSHA believes that the proposedstandard will better effectuate the purposes of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act of 1970 than the national consensus standards which havenot been made a part of this proposal, because this proposal is more comprehensiveand provides greater flexibility in its requirements for safety. The following discussion provides a more detailed explanation of the proposedprovisions related to welding, cutting, and heating in shipyards. Briefly,OSHA would revise the authority citation of Part 1915 to reflect the currentauthority for this proposed rulemaking, and OSHA proposes to revise theexisting Subpart D of Part 1915 in its entirety as set forth below. OSHA wishes to raise an issue involving the cost of several new proposalsin this document that are based upon ANSI Z49.1-1983. OSHA believes thatthese new proposals recognize current industry practice and that the proposalswould have little economic impact on the overall cost of compliance. Commentssupporting or rejecting this position are requested. If the commenter believesthat the adoption of the ANSI provisions would impose a significant costof compliance then supporting data and information should be included withthe comment. Section 1915.51 Scope, application, and definitions applicable to thissubpart. <T3>Paragraph (a)_Scope and application.</T3> In paragraph (a) of thisproposal, OSHA sets forth the scope and application of Subpart D of Part1915. Paragraph (a)(1) of the proposal would set forth the scope of SubpartD to include all welding, cutting and heating operations (hot work) andequipment in shipyard workplaces and operations including shipbuilding,ship repairing, and shipbreaking, except for construction work regulatedby 29 CFR Part 1926. Paragraph (a)(2) of the proposal would revise the existing language inandSection; 1915.2(a) to reflect the incorporation of relevant provisionsfrom Subpart Q of Part 1910, and to indicate that the general industrywelding, cutting, and heating regulations in that Subpart Q would no longerapply to shipyard workplaces and operations. Paragraph (a)(3) is a new paragraph that specifically addresses the scopeof andSection; 1915.53. It is proposed that andSection; 1915.53 would not coverthe design and construction or installation of bulk gas supply or pipingdistribution systems with a storage capacity greater than 20,000 cubicfeet. Currently, the OSHA general industry welding standards require bulkoxygen systems with a storage capacity of 13,000 cubic feet of oxygen connectedor ready for service, or more than 25,000 cubic feet including unconnectedreserves on hand at the site, be in compliance with the 1965 NFPA Standardfor Bulk Oxygen Systems at Consumer Sites, No. 566-1965. Because experienceand research has not revealed any bulk oxygen systems in use by shipyards,OSHA believes it is unnecessary to retain in the shipyard standards therequirement that such systems comply with the NFPA standards. OSHA requestsinformation whether such systems exist in or are currently planned for,shipyards and whether a requirement to comply with the latest NFPA bulkoxygen system consensus standard (NFPA 50-1985) should be included in theshipyard rules. <T3>Paragraph (b)_Definitions.</T3> In paragraph (b), OSHA is proposingto define two terms used in the proposed standards. New definitions areproposed for ``Immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH),'' and ``Immediatesevere health effects.'' These terms are new to Subpart D and are takenfrom definitions being developed in other OSHA standards in order to assureconsistency. Other definitions applicable to this Subpart are still inandSection; 1915.4 of Subpart A. Section 1915.52 General requirements. <T3>Paragraph (a)_Equipment.</T3> In paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(3), OSHAwould address the use of welding, cutting, and heating equipment. Paragraph(a)(1) would require that equipment be used for the purpose for which itis designed and that it be kept in good working condition. The proposedlanguage is derived from the existing language of andSection; 1910.252 (a)(1)(i)through (a)(1)(iii), and is written in more performance-oriented language.OSHA intends that all equipment be acceptable for its intended use andthat it be kept in good working condition. Such language, clearly indicatingOSHA's intent, would eliminate the need for specifically addressing eachindividual piece of equipment as is done in existing andSection; 1910.252(a).In paragraph (a)(2), OSHA proposes that all equipment be inspected at thebeginning of each shift and periodically thereafter to assure that it isin good working condition. The proposed language utilizes the existinglanguage of andSection; 1915.55 (f)(3), (g)(2), and (h), and andSection; 1915.56(d)(4),and is intended to cover all welding equipment in the shipyard. The proposedlanguage would help eliminate injuries related to the use of improperlyinstalled or faulty equipment. In paragraph (a)(3), OSHA proposes a new provision that would mandate thetagging and removal of defective equipment from the workplace. Although,existing shipyard welding regulations require the removal of defectiveequipment, or prohibit its use (see, e.g., andSection; 1915.55 (c)(3) [cylinders],(f)(3) [hoses], (g)(1) [torches]; andSection; 1915.56 (b)(4) [cables]), thecurrent rules do not address the tagging of such equipment. OSHA wouldrequire the removal of all defective equipment in order to prevent theuse of such equipment, and would propose, in addition, that such equipmentbe tagged in accordance with the general industry accident prevention tagsstandard, 29 CFR 1910.145(f), in order to identify the defective equipmentto anyone who may be unaware of the equipment's condition. The proposalwould require the tag to signal ``DANGER'' and to impart a message of thespecific hazard or of instructions to be followed, such as, the words ``DONOT USE.'' This proposal would address the hazardous situation when, forexample, a defective air wrench is returned to the equipment room withouta tag and placed on the shelf only to be reissued to another employee whois unaware of the defect. The proposed tag requirement would require theequipment be identified as defective and would eliminate the possibilityof reissue and subsequent injury. OSHA invites comments on whether defective equipment that has been removedfrom the work area and placed in an area so that the equipment may be discardedor disposed of should be tagged. <T3>Paragraph (b)_Engineering controls, work practices, and personal protectiveequipment (PPE).</T3> In paragraph (b) it is proposed that anyone performinghot work be protected against potential chemical or physical hazards. Physicalhazards can include those associated with the generated sparks and heatand with electrical shock. The chemical hazards posed by welding fumesand gases are dependent upon a number of factors including: The metal beingworked; the process and consumables being used; coatings on the work suchas paint, galvanizing, or plating; and contaminants in the atmosphere suchas halogenated hydrocarbon vapors from cleaning and degreasing activities.In addition, the composition of the fumes is usually different from thecomposition of the electrode or consumables. Reasonable expected fume productsof normal operation include those originating from volatilization, reaction,or oxidation of consumables, base metals and coating, and the atmosphericcontaminants noted. Reasonably expected gaseous products include carbonmonoxide, carbon dioxide, fluorides, nitrogen oxides, and ozone. See ANSI/ASCZ49.1-1983, <T3>Safety in Welding and Cutting.</T3> Paragraph (b)(1) would provide that toxic and hazardous substances regulatedby OSHA in 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart Z are to be controlled in accordancewith those provisions, unless otherwise specified in paragraph (h) of theproposed rules addressing work in confined spaces.OSHA is also inviting comment on whether the agency should consider adoptingfor shipyard welding operations the permissible exposure limits proposedon June 7, 1988 (53 FR 20960), for general industry (including weldingoperations in general industry). OSHA is not proposing new limits at thistime but is considering such action in the near future.In paragraph (b)(2), OSHA would require that contaminated air be exhaustedclear of all sources of intake air. The proposed language is a restatementof existing andSection; 1915.51(b)(1)(iv).In paragraph (b)(3), OSHA proposes a general performance-oriented provisionrequiring that appropriate personal protective equipment be provided andused in accordance with Subpart I of the shipyard standards. Where necessaryand appropriate, careful selection of personal protective equipment mustprotect employees from the various health and physical hazards associatedwith hot work, including those to the respiratory system, skin, eyes, face,hands, feet, head, body and hearing. The proposed provision does not listspecific protective equipment as do the existing standards in andSection;1915.51 (e)(1), (f)(2); andSection;andSection; 1915.56(e) and 1910.252 (e)(2)and (e)(3).In paragraph (b)(4), OSHA is proposing a provision to protect employeeswho are welding, cutting or heating, or assisting in such work from thermalor radiation burns by requiring the employer to provide appropriate protectiveclothing or equipment such as shields or curtains.In paragraph (b)(5), OSHA would require that no gas or mixture of gases,other than air, be used for ventilation, comfort cooling, blowing dustor dirt from clothing, or for cleaning the work area. The proposed languagewould specifically prohibit the use of oxygen. Oxygen is especially hazardouswhen used for such purposes. Although oxygen itself is not flammable, oxygen'spresence will drastically accelerate the speed with which burning takesplace. In addition, oil or grease may ignite spontaneously in the presenceof pure oxygen. The paragraph would also limit the discharge pressure ofair used for cleaning the workplace to 30 psi (207 kPa). High pressureair jets can penetrate an employee's skin and introduce air into the bloodstream. The proposed language is a combined restatement of andSection;andSection;1910.242(b) and 1915.51(b)(1)(vi).<T3>Paragraph (c)_Fire protection. </T3>In paragraph (c), OSHA would addresswork practices that reduce ignition sources and, correspondingly, the potentialfor fire and explosion during hot work operations. The proposed languageis derived for the most part from andSection;andSection; 1915.52 (a) and (b),1915.53(e), and 1910.252(d).The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) provides some insight onthe fire hazards during welding and cutting in their standard NFPA 51B-1984,<T3>Standard for Fire Prevention in Use of Cutting and Welding Processes</T3>(Ref. 2). Part of that explanation follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">1-1 <T3>Introduction</T3>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1-1.2 * * * many fires * * * have been caused by cutting and welding,primarily with portable equipment in areas not specifically designed orapproved for such work. Cutting and certain arc welding operations produceliterally thousands of ignition sources in the form of sparks and hot slag.The electric arc or the oxyfuel gas flame and the hot work pieces are alsoinherent ignition sources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1-1.3 A majority of fires in which cutting and welding is a factorhave been caused by sparks. These globules of molten metal have scatteredhorizontally as far as 35 feet (11 m), setting fire to all kinds of combustiblematerials. They have also fallen through cracks, pipe holes or other smallopenings in floors and partitions starting fires which have reached seriousproportions before being noticed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1-1.4 Electric arcs or oxyfuel gas flames, in themselves, have rarelycaused fire except where they have overheated combustibles in the vicinityof the work or where they have been used on containers that have held combustiblesand that have not been cleaned and purged. In the latter case, an explosiongenerally resulted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1-1.5 The heat of the metal being welded or cut has caused fires wherethe hot pieces were permitted to rest or fall upon combustible materials.Fires and explosions have also been caused where this heat was transmitted,as in the case of a container, through the metal to a flammable atmosphereor to combustibles within the container.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1-1.6 Anything which is combustible or flammable is susceptible toignition by the cutting and welding. The most common materials likely tobecome involved in fire are combustible building construction such as floors,partitions, and roofs; combustible contents such as wood, paper, textiles,plastics, chemicals, and flammable liquids and gases; and combustible groundcover such as grass and brush.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1-1.7 Preventing cutting and welding fires can best be achieved byseparating the combustibles from ignition sources or by shielding the combustibles.[Chapter 1, NFPA 51B-1984]</ITAG>In paragraph (c)(1), OSHA proposes to require that objects to be welded,cut, or heated be moved to a designated safe location whenever practicable.The proposed language is a restatement of requirements in existing andSection;andSection;1915.52(a)(1) and 1910.252(d)(2)(xv).In paragraph (c)(2), OSHA proposes to require that all movable fire hazardsbe removed from work areas where the object to be worked upon cannot bemoved. This is a restatement of requirements in paragraphs andSection;andSection;1915.52(a)(1) and 1910.252 (d)(1) and (d)(2).In paragraph (c)(3), OSHA proposes to require the use of positive meansto protect immovable fire hazards, and nearby employees performing othertasks, from heat, sparks, and slag. This is a restatement of paragraphandSection; 1915.52(a)(2).In paragraph (c)(4), OSHA proposes to require equivalent fire precautionsto be taken in compartments adjacent to compartments where hot-work isbeing performed. This is a restatement of existing paragraph andSection;1915.52(a)(3) with some editorial amendments to provide performance language.In paragraph (c)(5), OSHA proposes to require that openings in floors,decks, walls and bulkheads be covered or closed to prevent the passageof hot slag. This is a restatement of existing paragraph andSection; 1910.252(d)(2)(i)with editorial revision.In paragraph (c)(6), OSHA would require that fire extinguishing equipmentmeeting the requirements of 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart L, be provided andkept readily available in the work area. It would also prohibit the useof vaporizing liquid type extinguishers in confined spaces. This is a restatementof paragraph andSection; 1915.52 (b)(2) and (b)(4).In paragraph (c)(7), OSHA would require a fire safety inspection and authorizationto begin hot work to be completed by a competent person as applicable,prior to beginning hot work in locations not designed for such purposes.This is a combined restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252 (d)(2)(xiii)(b)and (d)(2)(vi). These standards require that employers designate an individualresponsible for authorizing cutting and welding operations in areas notspecifically designed for such processes and that these individuals inspectsuch areas before welding and cutting is permitted. The proposed provisionmaintains these requirements but reflects the fact that competent personsare the ``individuals responsible'' for performing such duties in shipyards.Inspections prior to beginning hot work on vessels and vessel sectionsare covered by Subpart B of the Shipyard Standards.In paragraph (c)(8), OSHA would require the use of trained fire watchesunder certain workplace conditions. The language is a rewrite of the existinglanguage in paragraphs andSection;andSection; 1910.252(d)(2)(iii) and 1915.52(b)(3).Although the OSHA general industry welding standard, ANSI Z49.1-1983 (paragraph6.4.3), and NFPA 51B-1984 (paragraphs 3-3.4 and 2-3.8), require fire watchesto last at least one half hour after completion of hot work, the currentshipyard welding standard, as well as the proposal, do not specify a minimumlength of time. Public comment is requested whether OSHA should specifya minimum length of time the fire watch should last after completion ofthe hot work.In paragraphs (c)(9), OSHA would prohibit hot work in flammable or explosiveatmospheres except as permitted in paragraph (h) of this section. Thisis a combined rewrite of paragraphs andSection;andSection; 1915.52(b)(1) and1910.252(d)(2)(vi)(c).<T3>Paragraph (d)_Work with preservative coatings. </T3>Paragraph (d) wouldaddress safe work practices in areas where hot work is done on surfacesprotected by preservative coatings. The proposed language is taken fromparagraph andSection; 1915.53 (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f).In paragraph (d)(1), OSHA proposes to require that a competent person testa coating's flammability before a coated surface is subjected to welding,cutting, or heating. OSHA would also require the stripping of preservativecoatings from such surfaces when such tests cannot be conducted. The firstsentence of the proposal is a restatement of andSection; 1915.53(b). Thesecond sentence is proposed to permit work to continue safely, with somelimitations, when tests are impractical or cannot be conducted due to timeconstraints. Public comment is requested on whether OSHA should designatea minimum distance that the flammable coating needs to be stripped fromthe point of heat application.In paragraph (d)(2), OSHA would require that coatings be stripped priorto hot work when tests indicate they are highly flammable. Preservativecoatings are considered highly flammable when scrapings burn with extremerapidity. This is a partial restatement of paragraph andSection; 1915.53(c).In paragraph (d)(3), OSHA proposes to address the hazards posed by performinghot work on toxic preservative coatings in enclosed spaces. In such areas,an employer must either strip the toxic coating far enough away from thearea of heat application to prevent employee exposure to toxic vapor orprotect employees with acceptable respiratory equipment. This is a partialrestatement of the requirement in andSection; 1915.53(d) (1) and (2). OSHAalso invites public comment on whether OSHA should designate a minimumdistance that the flammable coating needs to be stripped from the pointof heat application.Paragraph (d)(4) addresses the hazards posed by doing hot work on metalscovered by soft and greasy preservative coatings.In paragraph (d)(4)(i), OSHA would require that a competent person testthe space's atmosphere prior to beginning hot work to ensure that an explosiveenvironment does not exist. If the atmosphere is explosive, no hot workshall begin until the environment is made safe. This is a restatement ofthe requirements in paragraph andSection; 1915.53(e)(1).In paragraph (d)(4)(ii), OSHA proposes to require that soft and greasypreservative coatings be removed a sufficient distance from the area tobe heated to ensure that the temperature of the unstripped metal will notbe appreciably raised. This is a restatement of the mandatory languagein paragraph andSection; 1915.53(e)(2). OSHA further proposes to preventthe use of flame or heat to remove soft and greasy preservative coatings.This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1915.34(b)(2).In paragraph (d)(4)(iii), OSHA proposes to require tests for flammablevapors by competent persons immediately after hot work begins, and at frequentintervals thereafter to ensure that no such vapors exist. This is a restatementof the existing requirements in andSection; 1915.53(f). If such vapors arefound, OSHA would continue to require that all work stop immediately andremain stopped until the environment has been made safe and shall not beresumed until such additional precautions have been taken as are necessaryto ensure that the operation can be resumed safely.<T3>Paragraph (e)_Work in and on hollow metal spaces, containers and structuresnot covered by andSection; 1915.12. </T3>In paragraph (e), OSHA proposesto address hot work in hollow metal containers, structures, and similarenclosed spaces not covered in andSection; 1915.12. The proposed languageis taken for the most part from paragraph andSection; 1915.54 (a), (b), (c),(d), and (e).In paragraph (e)(1), OSHA proposes to require that hollow or jacketed structuresthat have contained flammable substances be either filled with water orthoroughly cleaned of the flammable substance and then tested for residuesthat may produce flammable vapors before hot work is authorized. This isa restatement of paragraph andSection; 1915.54(a). OSHA also proposes torequire that if water is used to inert the hollow or jacketed structurethe water levels must be maintained at the full level during the work processto assure that no air space can occur that could result in an explosiondue to flammable vapor accumulation. Any pipe lines or connection to thesehollow structures would have to be disconnected or blanked. This is a currentrequirement contained in paragraph andSection; 1910.252(d)(3)(i).In paragraph (e)(2), OSHA proposes to require inspections and, if necessary,testing of structural voids by a competent person to determine the presenceof flammable liquids or vapors. If flammable liquids or vapors are present,the void would have to be made safe prior to hot work. The proposed languageis a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1915.54(c).In paragraph (e)(3), OSHA would require that hollow or jacketed structuresbe vented or opened to permit the release of pressure that may build upduring hot operations. This is a combined restatement of existing paragraphandSection; 1915.54 (b), (d), and (e). The language is also similar to paragraphandSection; 1910.252(d)(3)(ii).<T3>Paragraph (f)_Work with fissionable materials. </T3>In paragraph (f),OSHA proposes to regulate hot work activities involving the use of, orexposure to, sources of ionizing radiation and activities involving theuse of radioactive materials. The proposed language in paragraphs (f)(1)and (f)(2) is a restatement of the existing language in paragraph andSection;1915.57 (a) and (b).<T3>Paragraph (g)_Work with metals of toxic significance. </T3>In paragraph(g), OSHA would address hot work operations on metals that are normallyused during such operations and that can produce toxic vapors or fumesupon the application of heat. These metals are zinc, lead, cadmium, chromium,mercury, and beryllium. OSHA believes that particular attention must bepaid the hazards associated with these metals during work with such metals.In paragraph (g)(1), OSHA would require meeting the proposed requirementsof paragraph (b) of this section when hot work is performed on any metalthat may generate a toxic substance exposure to employees upon the applicationof heat. The proposed language is a revision of paragraph andSection;andSection;1915.51(d)(1) and 1910.252(f)(2) so that it is consistent with OSHA's currentpolicy on the use of feasible engineering controls and administrative practicesto achieve compliance with permissible exposure limits and to use respiratorsif such controls are not feasible to achieve full compliance.In paragraph (g)(2), OSHA proposes to require the removal of residues orcargoes of metallic ores of toxic significance from areas where hot workis to take place. This language is a restatement of paragraph andSection;1915.51(g)(1).<T3>Paragraph (h)_Work in confined spaces. </T3>In paragraph (h), OSHAproposes to address the hazards of hot work operations in confined spaces.Hot work in confined spaces requires special precautions because the poorventilation and restricted access in such spaces often lead to hazardsassociated with the accumulation of toxic or flammable gases and vapors,or unsafe levels of oxygen.In paragraph (h)(1), OSHA proposes to require the protection of all employees,not just the welder, in the confined space from the hazards associatedwith inadequate ventilation such as, but not limited to, heat stress andexposure to toxic substances. The proposed language is a rewrite of theexisting language in andSection; 1910.252(f)(4)(i). This duty is also similarto that generally required in andSection; 1915.51(c)(1).In paragraph (h)(2), OSHA is proposing that in confined spaces with atmospheresimmediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH) only positive pressure,self-contained breathing apparatus or airline respirators approved by theMine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the National Institutefor Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) shall be used. The proposedlanguage updates the current language in andSection; 1910.252(f)(4)(iii)to reflect the transfer of respirator approval functions from the U.S.Bureau of Mines to MSHA and NIOSH. The proposed language is similar tothe existing language of andSection; 1915.152(a).In paragraph (h)(3), OSHA would require that all cylinders, except smallportable hand-held types, and all welding power sources be located outsideof confined spaces. The proposed language is a restatement of paragraphandSection; 1910.252(e)(4)(iii), except for the exemption pertaining to smallportable hand-held types of cylinders. The exception is proposed to permitthe use of the hand-held units because the smaller units are typicallyused for short-term soldering work or similar operations, rather than forthe long-term structural work. The quantity of gas present, normally bottledpropane, is significantly less than that found in the larger oxygen orfuel-gas cylinders and poses far less of a threat to employees than thelarger cylinders.In paragraph (h)(4), OSHA proposes to require that employees be made awareof any respiratory hazards that may exist in any confined space adjacentto spaces where hot work is being performed. Hot work operations on surfacescommon to two adjacent spaces may create respiratory hazards in eitherspace. The purpose of this standard is to assure employee safety duringentry into confined spaces adjacent to compartments where hot work is beingperformed. The proposed language is new and was taken from paragraph 7.3of ANSI Z49.1-1983.In paragraph (h)(5), OSHA proposes to require frequent checks of employeesworking alone in confined spaces to ensure their safety. This is a newrequirement and it is intended to provide coverage of a gap in protectionafforded by existing standards. In addition, OSHA invites comment on theappropriateness of using the term ``frequent.'' Basically, how frequentis ``frequent''?In paragraph (h)(6), OSHA would require an outside helper for confinedspace work there breathing apparatus is provided to the employee workingin the confined space. This is a restatement of andSection; 1910.252(f)(4)(iv).In paragraph (h)(7), OSHA would require that approved respirators be availableand ready for use by attendants stationed outside of confined spaces withatmospheres that are immediately dangerous to life or health.

In paragraph (c)(2), OSHA would require that torch heads be kept cleanand free from obstruction. The proposed language is a restatement of paragraphandSection; 1915.55(g)(1). In paragraph (c)(3), OSHA would require that hoses be purged prior to lightingthem the first time each day. This is a new requirement intended to assurethat gas or solid contamination is not present in the hose lines. The proposedlanguage has been taken from paragraph 10.5.2.2 of ANSI Z49.1-1983. In paragraph (c)(4), OSHA proposes to prohibit the purging of hose linesinside of confined spaces or near ignition sources. This would be a newrequirement, and is based upon paragraph 10.5.2.2 of ANSI Z49.1-1983. Theproposal is made to assure that flammable vapor-air mixtures are not introducedinto the confined spaces or near ignition sources. In paragraph (c)(5), OSHA proposes to prohibit the use of sources of ignitionsuch as matches, cigarette lighters, or hot work to ignite torches.

In paragraph (h)(2), OSHA would require that fuel gas manifolds exceeding3,000 cubic feet be located outside, or in a separate building or roomconstructed in accordance with ANSI/NFPA 51-1983, <T3>Design and Installation of Oxygen-Fuel Gas Systems for Welding, Cutting,and Allied Processes.</T3> This is a restatement of paragraph 10.9.3.2of ANSI Z49.1-1983, and is similar to andSection; 1910.252(a)(3)(i)(c). <T3>Paragraph (i)_Oxygen manifold capacity and locations. </T3>In paragraph(i)(1) (i) and (ii), OSHA would require certain criteria for the locationof oxygen manifolds in relation to fuel gas cylinders and other combustiblematerials. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252(a)(3)(ii)(b).In paragraph (i)(2) (i) and (ii), OSHA proposes to limit the number andlocation of high pressure oxygen cylinders. This is a restatement of paragraphandSection;1910.252(a)(3)(ii)(c), with the exception of a change to the separationdistance. The existing OSHA standard requires a 50-foot separation distance.OSHA believes that a 20-foot separation distance would be sufficient toensure safety. Paragraph 10.9.4.2.1 of ANSI Z49.1-1983 also recommendsa 20-foot distance. In paragraph (i)(3), OSHA proposes certain limitations on the locationof high pressure oxygen manifolds connected to cylinders with an aggregagecapacity of more than 6,000 cubic feet (168 cubic meters) of oxygen. Theproposed language is a restatement of paragraph 10.9.4.2.2 of ANSI Z49.1-1983,and is similar to andSection;1910.252(a)(3)(ii)(d). <T3>Paragraph (j)_Low pressure oxygen manifolds. </T3>In paragraph (j)(1)OSHA proposes a new requirement limiting the total capacity of low-pressureoxygen manifolds to 12,000 cubic feet (336 cubic meters).

In paragraph (k)(7), OSHA would require acceptable flash arresters to beinstalled between each cylinder and the coupler block. The proposed languagewould also permit the use of one flash arrester where there are not morethan three cylinders, and the cylinders are installed outdoors. This provisionis a restatement of andSection; 1910.252(a)(3)(v)(d). In paragraph (k)(8), OSHA proposes certain criteria for portable outletheaders, which are often used on shipyard piers and drydocks where theservice piping cannot be located close enough to the work to provide adirect supply. In paragraph (k)(8)(i), OSHA proposes to prohibit the useof portable outlet headers indoors or onboard vessels except where theyare necessitated by condition precluding the direct supply of gases fromoutlets on a service piping system. This is a restatement of paragraphandSection; 1910.252(a)(3)(iv)(a). In paragraph (k)(8)(ii), OSHA proposes to require a shut-off valve on eachoutlet on the service piping that supplies oxygen of fuel-gas to a portableoutlet header. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252(a)(3)(iv)(b).In paragraph (k)(8)(iii), OSHA would require detachable caps on serviceoutlets of portable outlet headers.

This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252(a)(3)(v)(a).Section 1915.54 Arc welding, cutting and heating. According to the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) <T3>Fire Protection Handbook </T3>(Ref. 3), the term arc welding, <ITAG tagnum="20">* * * applies to a number of processes that use an electric arc asthe heat source for melting and joining metals. The arc is a useful toolbecause its heat can be concentrated and controlled quite effectively.Frequently, but not always, a filler metal must be used to obtain a goodjoint. The arc is struck between the metals to be welded and an electrode,which is maneuvered along the joint or which may remain stationary whilethe work is moved beneath it. The electrode may be consumable or nonconsumable.If the latter, a separate rod or wire may be used as the filler metal.Consumable electrodes supply their own filler metal by melting and, bydecomposition of either a coveriny or a core, may shield the weld zonefrom unwanted atmospheric effects. [Section 9/Chapter 11, </ITAG><T3>Fire Protection Handbook, </T3>15th Edition] Arc welding processes include shielded metal arc welding, gas metal arcwelding, gas tungsten arc welding, plasma arc welding, and submerged arcwelding. <T3>Paragraph (a)_Electrical shock hazards. </T3>In paragraph (a)(1), OSHAproposes to protect employees from possible contact with electrical currentfrom alternating current (a.c.) or single-phase transformer-rectifier arcwelding machines while working under wet conditions, or warm surroundingswhere perspiration is a factor, or while working in locations where thereis a high risk of accidental contact with live electrical parts. Undersuch working conditions, employees are required to wear dry personal protectiveclothing. Wet or damp clothing may reduce contact resistance and increasecurrent to a value high enough to cause such violent muscular contractionthat the welder cannot release contact with the live part. This is a newstandard and the proposed language is taken from paragraph 11.2.2 of ANSIZ49.1-1983. In paragraph (a)(2), OSHA proposes to require that employee contact withlive electrical parts of arc welding equipment be prevented by insulatingconductive parts near the employee. This is a restatement of andSection;1910.252(b)(2)(iv)(d) using performance-oriented language.In paragraph (a)(3), OSHA would limit the voltage output of welding machines.The limits are a restatement of andSection; 1910.252(b)(2)(iii). In paragraph (a)(4), OSHA proposes to require the enclosure of all controlapparatus except operating wheels, levers, and handles.This is a restatementof andSection; 1910.252(b)(2)(iv)(b). In paragraph (a)(5), OSHA proposes to require that input power terminals,tap change devices, and live metal parts connected to input circuits becompletely enclosed and accessible only by means of tools. This is a restatementof andSection; 1910.252(b)(2)(iv)(c). In paragraph (a)(6), OSHA would limit the size of welding leads connectedto a power source, based upon the size of the grounding connector. OSHAwould also require that terminals be marked to indicate when they weregrounded. This is a restatement of andSection; 1910.252(b)(2)(iv)(d). In paragraph (a)(7), OSHA would require welding lead terminals be protectedfrom accidental electrical contact by employees, or from metal objectsthat may transfer the current to employees. The language is a restatementof paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(d). Several methods of achieving protection arelisted in the proposal (i.e., dead-front receptacles, recessed openings,hinged covers, heavy insulating sleeves), however, alternative means maybe instituted if they are equivalent. In paragraph (a)(8), OSHA would place limits on the voltage of portablecontrol equipment used by employees. In paragraph (a)(8)(i), OSHA proposesto limit voltage to portable control devices carried by employees to 120volts. In paragraph (a)(8)(ii), OSHA proposes to require the grounding of exposedmetal parts of portable control devices operating above 50 volts througha grounding conductor in the control cable. The proposed language in paragraphs(a)(8) (i) and (ii) is a restatement of andSection; 1910.252(b)(2)(iv)(e).In paragraph (a)(9), OSHA would prohibit the use of autotransformers ora.c. reactors to draw welding current directly from any primary a.c. powersource having a voltage exceeding 80 volts. This is a restatement of paragraphandSection; 1910.252(b)(2)(iv)(f). <T3>Paragraph (b)_Equipment. </T3>In paragraph (b)(1)(i), OSHA would proposeto limit the types of electrode holding devices used on arc welding equipment.This is a restatement of andSection; 1915.56(a)(1). In paragraph (b)(1)(ii), OSHA proposes to require that current carryingparts of electrode holders be insulated against the maximum voltage encounteredto ground. This is a restatement of andSection; 1915.56(a)(2). In paragraph (b)(1)(iii), OSHA would require the removal from service ofdefective electrode holders. This is similar to andSection; 1915.56(d)(4)and 1910.252(b)(4)(ii)(a), which require all defective arc welding equipmentto be removed from service. In paragraph (b)(2)(i), OSHA would require that all welding cable be insulated,flexible, and capable of handling the maximum current requirements of workin progress. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1915.56(b)(1).In paragraph (b)(2)(ii), OSHA proposes to limit the type of cable usedfor arc welding to be either free of repair or splices for a minimum tenfeet (3 m) from the end of the cable to which the electrode holder is connected,or the splice connector must have an insulating quality equal to or greaterthan the original cable. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1915.56(b)(2).In paragraph (b)(2)(iii), OSHA proposes to require that connections orsplices between two or more cables be insulated to a capacity at leastequal to that of the cable being used. This is a restatement of paragraphandSection; 1915.56(b)(3). In paragraph (b)(2)(iv), OSHA would require the proper connection and insulationof cable lugs when they are used to fasten cable together. This is a restatementof paragraph andSection; 1915.56(b)(3). In paragraph (b)(3)(i), OSHA would require that the workpiece or the metalupon which a welder works be grounded. This is a new requirement to assurethat employees are protected from electrical shock, and is based upon thelanguage in paragraph 11.3.2 of ANSI Z49.1-1983. In paragraph (b)(3)(ii), OSHA would require that ground return cables becapable of carrying a current capacity equal to or exceeding the maximumoutput capacity of all of the arc welding or cutting units it serves. Thisis a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1915.56(c)(1). In paragraph (b)(3)(iii), OSHA proposes to permit building frames, conduits,pipe lines, or other metal structures to be used as part of a ground returncircuit. To be used as such, these structures must (1) ensure continuityto ground; (2) be capable of carrying current at least equal to the maximumoutput of all the arc welding units they serve; and (3) be free of gases,flammable liquids, or other electrical circuits. This is a restatementof paragraph andSection; 1915.56(c)(2).In paragraph (b)(3)(iv), OSHA would require that when a pipeline or othermetal structure is used as part of a ground return circuit, electricalcontact exists in all joints of the structure or pipeline. OSHA would requirerejection of a pipeline or other structure as part of the ground returncircuit if an arc, sparks or heat are generated at any point along thecircuit line. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1915.56(c)(3).In paragraph (b)(3)(v), OSHA proposes to require that all joints on pipelinesor other metal structures continuously used as a ground return circuitbe bonded. Periodic inspections of the structure's joints must be conductedto ensure that electrolysis has not occurred or fire hazards exist becauseof such continuous use. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1915.56(c)(4).In paragraph (b)(3)(vi), OSHA would require that the frames on all arcwelding and cutting machines be grounded. This must be done either througha third wire in the cable containing the circuit conductor, or througha separate wire which is grounded at the source of the current. This isa restatement, in part, of paragraph andSection;1915.56(c)(5). In paragraph (b)(3)(vii), OSHA would require that grounding circuits, otherthan those employing a vessel's metal structure, be checked to ensure thatthe circuit between the ground and the grounded conductor has resistancelow enough to permit sufficient current to flow that would cause the fuseor circuit breaker to interrupt the current. This is a restatement, inpart, of paragraph andSection;1915.56(c)(5). In paragraph (b)(3)(viii), OSHA proposes to require that ground connectionsare inspected to ensure that they are mechanically strong and capable ofsafely carrying current equal to or exceeding the total maximum outputcapacity of all the arc welding units it services. This is a restatementof paragraph andSection; 1915.56(c)(6). <T3>Paragraph (c)_Operating instructions. </T3>In paragraph (c)(1), OSHAproposes to prohibit the use of welding machines that leak cooling water,shielding gases, or engine fuel. Such leaks could expose employees to possiblefire and explosion hazards. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection;1910.252(b)(4)(iv).In paragraph (c)(2), OSHA would require that electrode holders be eitherde-energized by turning the welding machine off, or disconnected from thewelding lead, whenever an employee must leave a work area or stop for anappreciable amount of time, such as to eat lunch. This is a restatementof paragraph andSection;1915.56(c)(3). In paragraph (c)(3), OSHA proposes to require welding machines to be unpluggedprior to their being moved. This is a new requirement from paragraph 11.4.7of ANSI Z49.1-1983, and is intended to prevent electrical shock duringmoving because the machine is live. The proposed language is similar toparagraph andSection; 1915.56(a)(3), which requires that the equipment be``turned off'' rather than unplugged. In paragraph (c)(4), OSHA would require that electrodes be removed fromholders when they are not in use to eliminate the danger of accidentalelectrical shock. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection;1915.56(d)(1).In paragraph (c)(5), OSHA proposes to require that when electrode holdersare not being used they must be placed in a location where they can notmake electrical contact with employees, conducting objects, flammable orcombustible liquid containers, or compressed gas cylinders. This is a restatementof paragraph andSection;1915.56(d)(1). In paragraph (c)(6), OSHA proposes that when guns of semi-automatic weldingmachines are not being used they must be placed so that the gun switchcannot be operated accidentally. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection;1915.56(d)(1).In paragraph (c)(7), OSHA would require that employees be instructed onhow to avoid electrical shock when operating welding equipment. Voltagesused with arc welding equipment can cause severe injuries or even death.Even mild shocks could cause involuntary muscle spasms which can lead toinjurious falls and other accidents. This is a restatement of paragraphandSection;1910.252(b)(4)(i). In paragraph (c)(8), OSHA would prohibit the cooling of electrode holdersby immersion in water. Such action might subject the welder or cutter toelectric shock. This requirement already exists in andSection; 1915.56(d)(2),but the proposed language has been taken from 11.4.9.5 of ANSI Z49.1-1983.In paragraph (c)(9), OSHA would require that water-cooled holders or gunsnot be used if any water leak or condensation exists. Again, the existenceof water can subject employees to a greater danger of electrical shock.This is a new requirement and it has been taken from paragrpah 11.4.9.6of ANSI Z49.1-1983. In paragraph (c)(10), OSHA would require that arc welding machines shallalways have their output electrically de-energized when tungsten electrodesare changed in gas tungsten arc electrode holders. This is a new requirementintended to prevent employee shock and has been taken from paragraph 11.4.9.7of ANSI Z49.1-1983. In paragraph (c)(11), OSHA proposes to require protection from exposureto direct rays of welding arcs for employees who may pass through the vicinityof arc welding operations. Various methods can be used to comply, includingenclosing the welding in a booth painted with a finish with low reflectivity;using non-combustible screens or shields similarly painted; or by requiringappropriately tinted goggles. Any effective means may be used to comply.This is a restatement of paragraph andSection;andSection; 1915.56(e) and 1910.252(e)(2)(iii).<T3>Paragraph (d)_Maintenance. </T3>In paragraph (d)(1), OSHA proposesthat commutators in welding machines be kept clean to prevent excessiveflashing. This is a new provision intended to reduce possible flammablevapor ignition sources. The proposed language has been taken from paragraph11.5.2 of ANSI Z49.1-1983. In paragraph (d)(2), OSHA would require that arc welding machines usedoutdoors be protected from rain and other inclement weather. Water, ofcourse, could present electrical shock hazards. This provision is takenfrom paragraph 11.5.2.2 of ANSI Z49.1-1983, but also reflects the intentbehind andSection; 1910.252(b)(4)(ix)(b). In paragraph (d)(3), OSHA would require that any arc welding machine thathas become wet must be dried and properly tested for safe operation priorto being placed into service. This is a restatement of andSection; 1910.252(b)(4)(ix)(b).<T3>Section 1915.55 Resistance welding. </T3>The <T3>Fire Protection Handbook, </T3>15th Edition (Ref. 3) describes resistancewelding as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">Welding heat for this process is created by resistance to flow ofcurrent through the parts being joined. Resistance welding is generallyused to join two overlapping metal sheets that may have different thicknesses.Electrodes conduct current through the sheets, which are clamped or rigidlyheld to provide good contact and pressure for holding molten metal at thejoint. [Section 9/Chapter 11, <T3>Fire Protection Handbook, </T3>15th Edition] </ITAG><T3>Paragraph (a)_Guarding. </T3>In paragraph (a)(1), OSHA proposes thatall control initiating devices on resistance welding equipment be arrangedor guarded to prevent accidental activation. Although the proposed languageis taken from paragraph 12.3.1 of ANSI Z49.1-1983, it reflects OSHA's intentexpressed by andSection; 1910.252 (c)(1)(iv), (c)(2)(iv) and (c)(3)(iv).In paragraph (a)(2), OSHA would require that all chains, gears, operatinglinkages, and belts associated with resistance welding equipment be arrangedor guarded to prevent employee contract. This is a restatement of paragraphandSection; 1910.252(c)(2)(iv). In paragraph (a)(3), OSHA proposes that point-of-operation guards be providedand used where employee's hands or fingers may become caught in the machinery.This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252(c)(2)(iv). In paragraph (a)(4), OSHA would require that all suspended portable weldinggun equipment, with the exception of the gun assembly, be equipped witha support system capable of supporting the total impact load in the eventof failure of any component of the supporting system. The provision isperformance-oriented; any combination of chains, cables, clamps or otherdevices may be used. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252(c)(3)(ii).In paragraph (a)(5), OSHA would require that moving holder mechanisms enteringa gun frame be designed to prevent the shearing of fingers placed on theoperating movable holder. If the holder mechanism cannot be designed toprevent shearing, guards shall be used to eliminate such possibility. Thisis a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252(c)(3)(v). <T3>Paragraph (b)_Electrical. </T3>In paragraph (b)(1), OSHA proposes torequire that all external weld-initiating control circuits operate at 120volts root mean square (rms) or less for stationary equipment, and 36 voltsor less for portable equipment. The stationary equipment voltage limitis a restatement of andSection; 1910.252(c)(2)(i). The portable equipmentvoltage limit is similar to andSection; 1910.252(c)(3)(iv), except that 36volts or less is allowed by the proposal instead of the 24 volt limit expressedin the current standard. OSHA believes the 36 volts limit is sufficientlyprotective of workers using portable equipment. ANSI Z49.1-1983, paragraph12.4.1, also used the 36 volt limit.In paragraph (b)(2)(i), OSHA would require that resistance welding equipmentand control panels containing capacitors used for stored energy resistancewelding involving voltages over 550 volts rms be insulated and protectedby complete enclosure. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252(c)(2)(ii).In paragraph (b)(2)(ii), OSHA proposes to require that all doors of theenclosures proposed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) above be provided with interlocksor contacts wired into the control circuits that are designed to interruptpower and short circuit all capacitors when the door panel is opened. Thisis a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252(c)(2)(ii). In paragraph (b)(2)(iii), OSHA would require that a manually operated switchor other suitable positive device be installed on equipment containingcapacitors described above to assure that those capacitors are completelydischarged. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252(c)(2)(ii).<T3>Paragraph (c)_Locks and interlocks. </T3>In paragraph (c)(1), OSHAwould require that all doors and access panels to resistance welding machinesand control panels accessible at the production floor be kept locked andinterlocked to prevent access by unauthorized employees. A door or panelwill be considered locked if a key, wrench or other instrument is requiredto open it. This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252(c)(2)(iii).In paragraph (c)(2), OSHA proposes that control panels remotely locatedon overhead platforms or in separate rooms shall be locked, interlockedor guarded by a physical barrier and warning signs, and that the controlpanels be kept closed when the equipment is not being serviced. This isa new paragraph. The present standard at andSection; 1910.252(c)(2)(iii)makes no exception from the locking and interlocking requirements for controlpanels located away from the production floor. The new provision is intendedto allow other methods of isolating control panels from workers when thepanels are already remote from the production floor or difficult to reach.The proposed language is taken from paragraph 12.4.3.2 of ANSI Z49.1-1983.<T3>Paragraph (d)_Spark shields. </T3>In paragraph (d), OSHA would requirethe installation of fire-resistant spark shields or guards, or the useof personal protective equipment to prevent injury to employees in, orpassing through, the work area due to flying sparks or molten metal. Theproposed language is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252(c)(2)(v).<T3>Paragraph (e)_Stop buttons. </T3>In paragraph (e), OSHA would proposeto require one or more safety emergency stop buttons on all welding machinesthat: (1) Require three seconds or more to complete a sequence; (2) havemechanical movements that can be hazardous to employees if guards are removed;and (3) have no buttons that would not themselves create a hazard to employees.This is a restatement of paragraph andSection; 1910.252(c)(2)(vii), withthe exception that the existing standard requires two or more emergencybuttons. OSHA is reducing the number of buttons required because it isbelieved that one button is often sufficient to activate emergency stopsby the machine operator. Further, if two or more buttons are necessary,they can be installed without violating the standard. This proposed provisionis in accord with paragraph 12.4.5 of ANSI Z49.1-1983. <T3>Paragraph (f)_Grounding. </T3>In paragraph (f), OSHA proposes threemethods by which welding transformer secondaries must be grounded. Theproposed language in paragraphs (f) (1), (2), and (3) has been taken fromparagraph 12.4.6 of ANSI Z49.1-1983, and is similar to andSection; 1910.252(c)(2)(ix).<T3>Paragraph (g)_Static safety devices.</T3> In paragraph (g), OSHA proposesthat static safety devices, such as pins, blocks and latches, be used withlarge resistance welding machines. The proposed language has been adoptedfrom paragraph 12.5 of ANSI Z49.1-1983. OSHA believes the ANSI standardaddresses and describes the requirement more fully than the current standardat andSection; 1910.252(c)(2)(viii), although the current standard does reflectthe same intent.In paragraph (g)(1), OSHA would require that electrically interlocked safetydevices be provided on large welding machines incorporating a movable platenor welding head.In paragraph (g)(2), OSHA proposes to require that the safety devices requiredin proposed paragraph (g)(1) must prevent the movement of the platen orwelding head under static load.In paragraph (g)(3), OSHA proposes to require that even though more thanone safety device may be required, each device alone shall be capable ofsustaining the full static load that the platen or welding head may imposeon the devices.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.

Preliminary Regulatory Impact Assessment and Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis</ITAG>Introduction and SummaryIn accordance with Executive Order No. 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 17,1981), OSHA has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed standard.Under the criteria established in E.O. 12291, OSHA has determined thatthe promulgation of this proposed revision would not be a ``major'' action.Data SourcesThe primary source for this section is the November 1985 Draft Final Reportby CONSAD Research Corporation entitled, ``Data to Support a RegulatoryAnalysis of the Proposed Standard for Shipbuilding and Repairing.'' Inaddition, OSHA also used an October 1984 report by Main Hurdman/KMG entitled,``Profile of the Shipbuilding and Repairing Industry.''Industry ProfileThe entire shipbuilding, ship repairing, and ship breaking industries wouldbe affected by the proposed consolidation of the welding, cutting and heatingsections of the existing Part 1915 Subpart D and the existing Part 1910Subpart Q because those operations are performed in all shipyards. In recentyears, shipyards have not prospered as an industry. By way of illustration,there were about 305 shipyards operating in 1986 which is fewer than halfof the 678 shipyards active in 1982. Another illustration is that therewere orders for 69 merchant vessels (1.82 million tons) in U.S. shipyardsin 1980 but no new orders for merchant vessels since 1985. Although thisloss of business has been partially offset by the increase in the U.S.Navy's demands for ships, the decline in the demand for commercial shipswill likely generate a further decline in the number of active shipyards.Population-at-RiskWelders are the group facing the most risk during welding, cutting, andheating operations. OSHA has estimated that approximately 15 percent ofthe shipyard employees are welders. The actual number of welders will dependupon the level of shipyard work. For example, shipyards employed 177,300workers in 1980 and about 136,300 workers in 1986. Thus, the number ofworkers at risk from injuries associated with welding would have been about26,600 in 1980 and about 20,450 in 1986. Thus, OSHA has estimated thatthe population-at-risk would be between 20,450 and 26,600 employees.Risk of Fatality or InjuryOSHA has estimated that the annual number of injuries in shipyards dueto welding accidents was between 395 and 640 between 1981 to 1986. Of theseinjuries, 50 to 80 were lost workday injuries. As the average number oflost workdays for lost workday injuries due to this type of accident was10.3 days, OSHA has estimated that the annual number of lost workdays inshipyards due to welding accidents would be between 515 days and 825 days.In addition, OSHA has determined that there would be between one and twoannual fatalities in shipyards associated with welding accidents.Feasibility, Benefits, and CostsOSHA has determined that this proposed standard would be technologicallyfeasible because it would permit the use of existing and readily availabletechnology and equipment.There are two potential sources of benefits from this proposed standard.The first source is the benefits that would accrue to those workers whoare at risk from current practices involving welding, cutting, and heatingin shipyards. OSHA believes that the proposed consolidation of Parts 1910and 1915 would likely lead to an increase in future compliance levels becauseconsolidating two sets of welding, cutting and heating standards into oneset would clarify the rules. In addition, the proposal substitutes performancelanguage for much of the existing specification language. Highly technicalprovisions have been replaced with clearer simpler language. Thus, theproposed consolidation may lead to a better understanding of the regulationsand an increase in compliance. This, in turn, may lead to an increase inemployee safety while the employee is welding, cutting or heating.The second source is the benefits that should accrue to those employerswho would be allowed to use certain welding practices and equipment thatare not allowed by the existing requirements but that would present nodanger to welders. The use of these advanced practices and equipment wouldallow employers to maintain the necessary level of safety while increasingproductivity over that possible under the existing standards.OSHA does not have any quantitative estimates of these potential benefitsand is requesting information and comments on this issue. As this is aPreliminary Regulatory Impact Assessment (PRIA), all comments will be carefullyanalyzed by OSHA for incorporation into the RIA for the final rule.The basis for the estimated costs of compliance with the proposed standardis the CONSAD report. In order to obtain this information, CONSAD circulatedcopies of the draft proposed standards to the two major industry tradeassociations and to individual shipbuilders. CONSAD then employed telephonequestionnaires and site visits to elicit information concerning the potentialeconomic impact of the provisions contained in the draft proposed consolidatedstandard. That information was used by CONSAD to develop its estimatesof the costs of compliance.The proposed standard requires that personal exposures to airborne hazardoussubstances during welding, cutting and heating operations be below theestablished limits for the substances in the 29 CFR 1910.1000 Z Tables,and in the Part 1910 hazardous substance-specific standards. In addition,the proposal requires flammability testing of surfaces covered by a preservativecoating. Although, there are currently no provisions in 29 CFR 1910.1000requiring monitoring of employees exposure, and flammability testing isalready required under the existing Part 1915, CONSAD assumed that someadditional monitoring activities would take place. If this additional monitoringwere conducted, OSHA estimates that the annual cost would be $1.8 milliondollars.OSHA invites public comment concerning this preliminary RIA. Any commentreceived will be carefully analyzed by OSHA for incorporation into theRIA for this final rule.Regulatory Flexibility CertificationPursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Assistant Secretary preliminarily certifies thatthe proposed standard would not have a significant impact upon a substantialnumber of small entities. OSHA invites public comment concerning this certification.An important criterion that governs a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis iswhether the proposed standard would impose significant cost upon smallentities. ``Significance'' is determined by the impact upon profits, marketshare, and on the entity's financial viability. In particular, the proposedstandard's effect upon small entities relative to that upon large entitiesneeds to be specifically evaluated. That is, OSHA must determine whetherthe proposal would have a relatively greater negative effect on small entitiesthan on large entities, thereby putting small entities at a competitivedisadvantage.OSHA has identified only minor costs associated with Subpart D. Thus, OSHAhas concluded that this proposed standard would not have a significantadverse impact upon a substantial number of small entities.The assessment is available for inspection and copying at the OSHA TechnicalData Center, Room N-2634, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC20210. OSHA invites comments concerning the conclusions reached in boththe Preliminary Regulatory Impact Assessment and the Regulatory FlexibilityCertification.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Finding of No Significant ImpactThis proposed rule and its major alternatives have been reviewed in accordancewith the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Guidelines of the Council of Environmental Quality(CEQ) (40 CFR Parts 1500-1517), and the Department of Labor's NEPA Procedures(29 CFR Part 11). As a result of this review, the Assistant Secretary forOSHA has determined that the proposed rule will have no significant environmentalimpact.The proposed revisions focus on the reduction of accidents or injuriesby means of work practices and procedures, and proper use and handlingof equipment. The proposal also contains language, definition, and formatchanges. These revisions do not affect air, water, or soil quality, plantor animal life, the use of the land, or other aspects of the environment.As such these revisions are therefore categorized as excluded actions accordingto Subpart B, andSection; 11.10, of the DOL NEPA regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Recordkeeping</ITAG>This proposed standard contains no ``collection of information'' (recordkeeping)requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Public Participation</ITAG>Interested persons are requested to submit written data, views and argumentsconcerning this proposal. These comments must be postmarked by February27, 1989, and submitted in quadruplicate to the Docket Office, Docket No.S-043, Room N-2634, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue,NW., Washington, DC 20210. The data, views and arguments that are submitted will be available forpublic inspection and copying at the above address. All timely submissionsreceived will be made a part of the record of this proceeding. Additionally, under section 6(b)(3) of the OSH Act and 29 CFR 1911.11 interestedpersons may file objections to the proposal and request an informal hearing.The objections and hearing requests should be submitted in quadruplicateto the Docket Office at the address above and must comply with the followingconditions: 1. The objections and hearing requests must include the name and addressof the individual or organization making the objection or request; 2. The objections and hearing requests must be postmarked by February 27,1989. 3. The objections and hearing requests must specify with particularitythe provisions of the proposed rule to which objections is taken or aboutwhich the hearing request is made, and must state the grounds therefor;4. Each objection and hearing requests must be separately stated and numbered;and 5. The objections and hearing requests must be accompanied by a detailedsummary of the evidence proposed to be adduced at the requested hearing.Interested persons who have objections to various provisions or have changesto recommend may of course make these objections or recommendations intheir comments and OSHA will fully consider them. There is only need tofile formal ``objections'' separately if the interested person desiresto request an oral hearing. OSHA recognizes that there may also be interested persons who, throughtheir knowledge of safety or their experience in the operations involved,would wish to endorse or support certain provisions in the standard. OSHAwelcomes such supportive comments, including any pertinent accident dataor cost information which may be available, in order that the record ofthis rulemaking will present a balanced picture of the public responseon the issues involved. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. State Plan Standards</ITAG>The 25 States and territories having OSHA-approved occupational safetyand health plans which cover the issues of maritime safety and health mustrevise their existing standards within six months of the publication dateof a final standard or show OSHA why there is no need for action, e.g.,because an existing State standard covering this area is already ``at leastas effective'' as the revised Federal standard. Currently four states (Minnesota,Oregon, Vermont, and Washington) with their own State plans cover privatesector on-shore maritime activities. Federal OSHA enforces maritime standardsoffshore in all States and provides onshore coverage of maritime activitiesin Federal OSHA States and in the following State plan States and territories:Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut,\1\ Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York,\1\<NOTE/> North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah,Virginia, Virgin Islands, and Wyoming.
