The National Economic Commission will issue a final reportsupported by the seven Republicans on the commission and oneDemocrat appointed by President Bush, Thomas Ashley, a formercongressman from Ohio, officials said.   The majority report endorses Bush's stand against new taxes andhis proposal to cut the capital gains tax.   The minority Democratic report, supported by the six membersappointed by the party's congressional leadership, will critize thepresident's flexible freeze as an insufficient response to thecritical problem of the deficit but will stop short of endorsing newtaxes to deal with the deficit, officials said.   Commission member Rep. William H. Gray III, a member of theDemocratic House leadership and a former House Budget Committeechairman, blamed partisanship by Republicans for the group's failureto succeed.   ``The president didn't want a bipartisan deficit-eduction plan,''he said. ``He wanted his own plan, the flexible freeze, and heinsisted on it from Republican members.''   Gray said that as a result, ``instead of something bold thatcould have moved us forward, we end up leaving it to Congress andthe administration to continue the fight.''   The 14-member commission was created by Congress following theOctober 1987 stock market crash. The panel's supporters hoped thegroup, which was given a March 1, 1989, reporting date, would beable to devise a plan to solve the government's huge budget deficits.   Early in the presidential campaign, however, Bush derided thepanel _ which had the support of his Republican primary opponent,Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan. _ as nothing but a stalking horse for taxincreases.   After being elected, Bush did appoint the final two members tothe panel, Ashley and former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev. But aftertaking office, Bush refused to extend the panel's reporting deadlinefor six months, as some members had hoped he would to give the panelmore time to reach a consensus.   That decision all but sealed the panel's fate and with only a fewweeks remaining, the commission accepted that it would not be ableto reach a compromise and began preparing separate majority andminority reports.   Dean Kleckner, a Republican member of the commission, saidTuesday that the majority report would call for reform of the budgetprocess through steamlining the congressional budget committee,granting the president line-item veto authority of budget bills andrecommending a constitutional amendment requiring balanced budgets.   He said the report would also recommend adoption of a two-yearbudget process rather than the annual appropriation cycle now used.   ``The report reflects the will of taxpayers throughout thenation,'' Kleckner said in a statement. ``Testimony to thecommission from 85 witnesses and more than 1,300 responses fromprivate citizens and groups this past 11 months clearly indicatedopposition to higher taxes and irresponsible spending.''</TEXT></DOC>
