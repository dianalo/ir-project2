In addition to laying out his policies on hyperinflation,recession and the soaring deficit, he has promised quick resolutionof a problem that plagued President Raul Alfonsin: army oppositionto trying officers accused of violating human rights during the1976-83 military dictatorship.   ``Menem is a chess player and he plays to win,'' said Manuel Moray Araujo, a sociologist and pollster. ``He prepares the ground andthen he advances.''   Menem surprised many by choosing three Cabinet ministers fromoutside his Peronist Party and pledging to sell state companies thatwere nationalized or created in the 1940s and 1950s by the party'sfounder, dictator Juan Peron.   Adolfo Perez Esquivel, a human rights activist who won the 1980Nobel Peace Prize, said he was impressed by Menem's attempt lastmonth to oust Saul Ubaldini as general-secretary of the GeneralLabor Confederation.   The labor organization has been the backbone of the PeronistParty for four decades and held 13 general strikes during thefive-year term of President Alfonsin, whom Menem replaces.   Menem said publicly that Ubaldini wanted to leave the laborfederation and had been offered a diplomatic post abroad. Ubaldinidenied it and refused the job.   ``He tried to get rid of Ubaldini; that's very interesting,''Perez Esquivel said. ``He is trying to increase his room to maneuverand part of that means getting rid of people who might be politicalopponents.''   The new president, elected May 14, faces economic problems thatare immediate and enormous.   Inflation in June alone exceeded 100 percent, unemployment isabout 10 percent, the currency has lost 97 percent of its valuesince February and the deficit has grown to an estimated 12 percentof the $80 billion gross national product.   Arrears of $4.5 billion in payments on the $60 billion foreigndebt make it impossible to obtain new loans. The central bank holdsabout $1 billion worth of gold, but virtually no foreign currency.   Real wages have shrunk by at least 40 percent since January.   Shantytowns and malnutrition are spreading. Supermarkets inCordoba, Mendoza and Rosario cities were looted this week in a minorreplay of the food riots six weeks ago.   ``We're starting from nothing,'' Menem said in an interviewpublished Sunday in El Cronista Comercial, a financial daily.   ``We're going to do major surgery,'' he declared in reference tothe telephone, railway, oil and other state companies that losemoney and siphon off funds from the budget.   Leaders of Brazil, Peru, Paraguay, Panama and Yugoslavia arrivedFriday for the ceremony. Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Julio M.Sanguinetti of Uruguay were expected later.   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger arrived as a specialguest of Menem. The leader of the U.S. delegation, CommerceSecretary Robert Mosbacher, arrived Thursday.   Menem's economic plan centers on making state companies privateto attract foreign capital, voluntary price controls to curbinflation, low-interest business loans to maintain production andjobs, incentives for farm production and exports, and wage raises toincrease consumer demand.   To reduce the deficit, Menem plans to cut subsidies, enforce taxlaws and raise utility rates. Unions oppose the sale of statecompanies for fear of mass layoffs, businessmen oppose pricecontrols and wage increases, and workers are against higher utilityrates.   With his conservative appointments and policies, Menem is turningaway from the Peronist Party rank and file who elected him.   Mora y Araujo said: ``He wants to do something that hasn't beendone in Argentina since the 1930s: govern to the political right,but with popular support.''   Alfonsin, whose Radical Civic Union party lost the May 14election, tried many of the same measures and was blocked.   He also faced three rebellions by soldiers pressing the view thattrials of officers for human rights abuses during the dictatorshipmust end. Menem is said to favor an amnesty, which would anger humanrights groups.   A commission appointed by Alfonsin documented the cases of nearly9,000 people who disappeared in 1976-83 and were presumed killed.Estimates by human rights organizations range up to 30,000.</TEXT></DOC>
