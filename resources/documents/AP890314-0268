Lloyd Bentsen,D-Texas, said today.   Bentsen said trucks loaded with U.S. hogs are either on their wayor at the U.S.-Mexico border because the ban was imposed with littleor no prior warning. His office said hog trucks have been stopped atthe border since Friday, but it wasn't immediately clear whethertruckloads of hogs were waiting for entry to Mexico or turning backto other markets.   Bentsen said he had asked U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hillsand Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter to intervene and negotiatean end to the trade barrier.   Pat El-Hinnaway, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department'sAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said the agency ``justreceived official notification from Mexico'' about the ban. ``We arein the process of translating it (from Spanish) and analyzing it,''she said.   Bentsen said hog cholera has been eradicated from the UnitedStates for over a decade.   ``In fact, it is illegal under U.S. law to vaccinate hogs againsthog cholera, and since the hogs in question are market hogs destinedfor slaughter, such a vaccination would be moot in any case,'' hesaid.   He said the Mexican ban, ``which has no basis in scientificfact,'' may be based on ``mistaken information.''   The senator said he hoped an ``exchange of information'' wouldresolve the ban. ``But if not, we should consider the remediesavailable to us under our law and the international agreements towhich both Mexico and the United States are signatories,'' he said.   The Agriculture Department said Mexico imported $11.5 million inlive market and breeder hogs in 1988, with most of the importsoccuring in the last seven months of the year. Before last June,Mexico had a ``prohibitive'' 10 percent tariff on hog imports,Bentsen's office said.   In 1987, under the 10 percent tariff, Mexico imported only$650,000 in U.S. hogs. This year's imports were expected to exceed$11.5 million if they had continued at the current rate, the officesaid.   It quoted figures from the National Pork Producers Councilshowing Mexico imported $9.5 million in live hogs from the UnitedStates last year, excluding breeders.</TEXT></DOC>
