The NUCLARRsystem software resides on an IBM (or compatible) personal micro-computer.NUCLARR can be used by the end user to furnish data inputs for both humanand hardware reliability analysis in support of a variety of risk assessmentactivities. The NUCLARR system is documented in a five-volume seriesof reports. Volume IV of this series is the User's Guide for operatingthe NUCLARR software and is presented in three parts. This document,Part 1: Overview of NUCLARR Data Retrieval provides an introductory overviewto the system's capabilities and procedures for data retrieval. The methodsand criteria for selection of data sources and entering them into theNUCLARR system are also described in this document.</TEXT></DOC>
