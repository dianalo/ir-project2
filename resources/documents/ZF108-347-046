(products).andO;Product:   Assistant Controller Series 5.8 (Financial software).andO;Topic:     AccountingSoftware packagesFinancial SoftwareEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Lake Avenue Software Inc.andM;ASSISTANT CONTROLLER SERIES 5.8andM;The PC and Mac versions of this solid accounting package offer importantaccounting features, such as automatic reversals and recurring postings, aswell as batch and automatic posting to the general ledger.andP;  The number ofaccounts is limited only by the available disk space.andP;  While users can haveonly one period open at a time, they can work with as many as 25 previousperiods by using a temporary file.andM;To consolidate data from multiple companies, users must purchase the EnhancedFinancial Reporting module ($495 single- user, $695 multiuser).andP;  This reportwriter comes with several built-in reports and also lets users customizeexisting reports.andM;Lake Avenue uses the same dBASE III source code for the PC and Mac products,so the two versions are almost identical.andP;  It uses the same dBASE filestructures, so users with run-time versions of FoxBASE on both PCs and Macscan share data on a network.andM;Unfortunately, the Mac version looks like a PC program.andP;  Rather than standardMac pull-down menus, for example, it uses numbered menus.andP;  It also lacksMac-style dialogue boxes.andM;Lake Avenue ships the same manuals with the Mac and PC products.andP;  Thefrequently italicized &quot;Macintosh version&quot; and &quot;IBM version&quot; notes can beannoying, but they appear primarily in the installation and configurationsections.andP;  The manuals are otherwise useful, although they would be improvedwith more tutorial information.andM;The product's main PC and Mac modules cost $495 each for single-user versionsand $695 each for multiuser versions.andP;  Lake Avenue also offers many othermodules, including order entry and job costing.andP;  Source code is availableupon request at no extra charge.andM;The standard single-user versions do not support multiple companies; anoptional &quot;multi-company&quot; version costs $200 extra.andM;Lake Avenue Software Inc. of Pasadena, Calif., can be reached at (818)351-5483.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;Gloria Fasana, payroll manager at BSE Management Inc., an environmentalconsulting firm in Arcadia, Calif., has both the Mac and PC versions of thepackage, but is planning to standardize on the PC-based system.andM;Changing from the Macintosh to the PC should be easy for the users, accordingto Fasana, because commands are consistent in both versions.andM;Scott Hassel, senior vice president of Media Headquarters Inc., a mediabuying service in Los Angeles, discovered an incompatibility between the Macversion's payroll module and the AppleShare network.andM;&quot;The problem is that in printing [over the network] the typeface would changeperiodically for some reason and the spacing would be off,&quot; he said.andP;  Otherthan this gaffe, Hassel is pleased with the product's accounting options.andM;However, the documentation was somewhat confusing, he claimed.andP;  &quot;Most of theinstructions are geared toward the PC version,&quot; he said, &quot;and you have to besure whether or not you are looking at [instructions for] the Macintosh orthe PC version.&quot;andM;</TEXT></DOC>
