Exile sources in Vienna, Austria, and a diplomat in Sofiaindicated there were many more casualties in the violence lastweekend, although they could not give figures. Turkish newspaperssaid as many as 25 people were killed in the clashes.   Northeastern Bulgaria is home to most of the 900,000 ethnicTurks in the Balkan country.   The weekend disturbances were among the worst since a campaignin the early 1980s by Bulgarian authorities to get ethnic Turks toadopt Bulgarian-sounding names, restrict their Moslem religiousrites and bar the Turkish language in public.   The unrest in Bulgaria highlighted the recent rise in ethnictensions throughout Eastern Europe. From the Soviet Union tononaligned communist Yugoslavia, ethnic minorities have rebelledagainst discrimination and the denial of rights often enumerated innational constitutions.   The state-run news agency BTA said Wednesday that two peoplewere shot and killed by security forces and a third died of heartfailure during the clashes in the village of Todor Ikonomovo.   Three other people, also believed to be ethnic Turks, wereinjured in the village 187 miles east of Sofia, BTA said.   In addition to the Todor Ikonomovo, riots also broke out in someareas of the regions of Razgrad and Varna, according to BTA.   The diplomat in Sofia, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthe demonstration in Razgrad involved between 4,000 and 5,000people, and 200 arrests were made.   Authorities moved in tanks and helicopters after the clashes inRazgrad, the diplomats said, and communications to the city werecut. It was not known if they had been restored by Wednesday.   He said he also heard of clashes between ethnic Turks andsecurity forces in Dulovo and Kaolinovo in the northeastern part ofthe country.   In Ankara, Turkey, Foreign Ministry spokesman Inal Batu toldreporters the government had formally asked Bulgaria forinformation about the unrest.   In Washington, the State Department condemned the crackdown onethnic Turks.   ``We deplore Bulgaria's blatant use of force in attempting tosilence the long-repressed ethnic Turkish minority,'' a statementsaid. ``We have repeatedly raised our objections in both bilateraland international fora to the Bulgarian treatment of its ethnicTurkish minority.''   BTA did not refer to ethnic Turks in its report becauseofficially there is no Turkish minority in Bulgaria.   ``Extremist-minded individuals, some under the influence ofalcohol, committed a gross violation of peace and tried to drawgroups of the population into acts of lawless violence,'' it said.   It blamed the disturbances on ``inaccurate information providedby some local authorities'' on recently eased travel laws, whichallegedly created ``misunderstandings among certain strata of thepopulation.''   The new laws, passed by the Bulgarian parliament this month,make it easier for the country's 8.9 million citizens to get apassport and travel abroad. This would also include ethnic Turksseeking to make trips to neighboring Turkey.   The report did not say exactly how the alleged``misunderstandings'' of the travel laws gave rise to the unrest.   Emighre sources in Vienna said a protest hunger strike amongethnic Turks that started May 6 has spread to several parts ofBulgaria and is estimated to involve up to 300 people at a time.   Turkey ruled Bulgaria for 500 years before 1863, and there is along history of conflict. Periodic unrest has been reported since1984 in ethnic Turkish areas, and reports of growing protest havecirculated among diplomats in Sofia for at least a month.</TEXT></DOC>
