(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Lisa L. SpiegelmanandM;The 80386 chip brings with it a host of advantages -- big memory, high speed,new application power -- but it also requires new hardware designs andperipherals that can raise the cost of new PCs.andM;Wouldn't it be splendid if there were a processor that gave access to 80386features but used '286 hardware and peripherals? That's what Intel Corp.andO;thought, too, when it announced the 16MHz 80386SX microprocessor last June.andO;The SX is identical to its 32-bit predecessor except for its 16-bit externalbus.andM;This difference should have allowed PC makers to build SX-based desktop andlaptop computers with '386 functionality and '286 prices because they couldbe built with many of the same components as an AT computer.andP;  But the chip'sinitial steep price of $165 per chip (in quantities of 1,000) and limitedsupplies caused SX-based computers to be priced higher than '286 computers,and it dampened users' initial interest in 386SX-based machines.andM;Now, the SX has a lower price, and interest in 386SX machines hasreintensified; the chip looks as though it's at last going to take hold inlow-end desktop machines and high-end laptops.andM;At first glance, the SX seemed a natural for success because it made creatinga '386 PC so easy.andP;  For example, a '286 and an SX machine could use identical16-bit peripheral chips such as CRT and disk controllers, memoryconfiguration and bus architecture, said Jim Panfil, marketing manager ofIntel's microprocessor division in Santa Clara, Calif.andP;  By comparison, a '386computer requires a 32-bit bus and memory architecture and faster peripheralchips that cost more than '286 designs.andM;But price proved the problem.andP;  Compaq Computer Corp.'s Deskpro 386s, thefirst computer to use the SX chip, originally listed for $3,799 (in Februarythe price dropped to $3,599), while '286 computers range from $1,000 to$3,000.andM;''We haven't started to implement 80386SX computers because the cost has beenout of line,'' said Walter Kennamer, a partner with the accounting firm ofErnst andamp; Whinney in Cleveland.andP;  ''For the price difference between an SXcomputer and a '386, most people will pay the premium to get the faster'386,'' he said.andP;  As a result, PC makers with new SX computers have seenslower than expected sales.andM;PC Designs Inc., for example, hasn't seen many buyers for its SX computer.andO;''Our SX computer isn't shipping yet, and there are not a lot of orders forit,'' said Fred Skinner, vice president of marketing for the Tulsa, Okla.,andO;company.andM;For NEC Information Systems Inc., which markets an SX-based desktop andportable computer, early sales have been disappointing, said Dick Miller,director of entry systems marketing for NEC in Boxboro, Mass.andP;  The demand islighter than expected for several reasons, he said.andP;  First, only NEC andCompaq have been shipping products despite many product announcements, so thechip isn't widely known.andM;Second, it's been hard for dealers to position these computers because theyare more expensive than '286s but don't have the performance of '386s, Millersaid.andM;Third, dealers are selling futures when they sell an SX computer: They'reselling compatibility with '386 software that largely doesn't exist yet.andM;''The end user is confronted with, 'Should I spend less right now or invest alittle more in an SX computer to carry me over?' '' said Miller.andP;  As SXcomputers fall in price, the gap will narrow, he believes.andM;In response to this slow start, Intel lowered the SX price in January from$165 to $89 per chip in quantities of 1,000 and increased production of thechip.andM;At the original price -- $80 higher than for '286 chips -- SX-based computerswere going to end up at least $300 more expensive than '286-based computers.andO;That didn't provide much incentive for PC vendors to switch, said Intel'sBruce Schechter, a product line manager for midrange microprocessors.andP;  ''Ourmessage is that the systems introduced last year were comparable more to '386prices.andP;  But this year we should see SX computers that are comparable to '286pricing,'' he said.andM;''As Intel drops their price, that will help system manufacturers reduce thecost of the computers,'' said Larry Fortmuller, director of systems marketingfor AST Research Inc. in Irvine, Calif.andP;  AST's SX computer, the PremiumWorkstation/386SX, for example, is priced at $3,195 and is scheduled forrelease in the second quarter, Fortmuller said.andM;Already, a smattering of new lower-priced SX computers are available or areentering the market that reflect Intel's latest pricing and the promise of80386-based computers at all price points.andM;Club American Technologies Inc., Eltech Research Inc.andP;  QIC Research Inc. andAST are already taking advantage of the new pricing.andP;  Eltech's SX computer,the Model 4682, is priced at $2,415 with 1M byte of memory and a 5-1/4-inchdrive.andP;  With a similar configuration, Club AT's SX-based computer is pricedat $1,595 with 512K bytes of memory.andP;  QIC Research's QIC 386SX machine ispriced at $1,675 with 1M byte of memory.andM;Other SX desktop computers include NEC's PowerMate SX, Compaq's Deskpro 386s,Advanced Logic Research Inc.'s VIPSX386, American Mitac Corp.'s MPC2386 andEverex Systems Inc.'s Step 386is.andM;PowerMate SX, which is available for $3,595, has 2M bytes of memory, sixexpansion slots and a 5-1/4-inch drive.andP;  Deskpro '386s, also available now,is equipped with 1M byte of memory, four expansion slots and a 5-1/4-inchdrive.andP;  It costs $3,599.andM;Fifty OEMs have announced SX systems, said Intel's Panfil.andP;  Most SX-basedproducts are desktop computers; only a few are laptops and upgrade boards.andM;NEC and Club AT are two laptop makers with new SX-based entries.andP;  Club AT's13-pound portable, the Sparrow III SX, is priced at $2,595 with 2M bytes ofmemory, one expansion slot, Color Graphics Adapter (CGA)-compatible graphicsand a 3-1/2-inch drive.andP;  It will be available in March.andM;'Ideal' for LaptopsandM;''The SX chip is ideal for laptop computers because it utilizes surface-mounttechnology, so the chip is smaller and less expensive than the '386,'' saidPanfil.andM;NEC's SX laptop, called the Powermate Portable SX, is priced at $6,595; itincludes Video Graphics Array (VGA)-compatible graphics, 2M bytes of memory,three expansion slots, a 3-1/2-inch floppy-disk drive and a 42M-bytehard-disk drive.andM;As an upgrade for '286 computers, the SX chip can be purchased as a smallboard from a handful of vendors including Everex Systems and Cumulus Corp.andO;Cumulus' board, called the 80386SX Card, costs $595.andP;  It does not take up anexpansion slot; it plugs directly into an empty CPU socket in a '286computer, according to Marty Alpert, chairman and CEO for Cumulus, inCleveland.andM;For corporate buyers, SX-based products open up a family of multitaskingsoftware and 32-bit software, Panfil said.andP;  The 32-bit software includesMicrosoft Corp.'s Windows 386 and Borland International Inc.'s Paradox 386.andO;80286-based computers can't run these 32-bit programs.andM;''There is a family of 16-bit packages that have been rewritten to the '386family such as Paradox 386,'' Panfil said.andP;  ''These programs operate five toeight times faster than their 16-bit predecessors.andP;  Also, there is softwarethat was previously in the domain of minicomputers, which is being rewrittento the '386 chip.''andM;In addition, the 80386 architecture has better multitasking capabilities thanthe '286 chip, Intel officials said.andP;  While the '286 version of OS/2 iscapable of running only one DOS program in the compatibility box, the 32-bit80386 version of OS/2, when it becomes available, should operate multipleprograms, said the officials.andM;While the 80386SX also has these capabilities, the chip operates 32-bitsoftware 30 percent slower than the '386 chip.andP;  Intel attributes this to theSX's bus architecture, which sends data at 16 bits -- twice as slow as the80386's 32-bit bus.andM;The difference in the bus architecture makes the 16MHz 80386SX computerequivalent to a 12MHz 80386 computer, said Sunny Chan, an engineer for QICResearch Inc. in Milpitas, Calif.andP;  ''In terms of performance, the SXcomputers fit right in between a 16MHz 80386 computer and a 12MHz 80386computer.''andM;But the SX's 16-bit bus architecture makes no difference between theperformance of a 16MHz SX computer and a 16MHz '286 computer.andP;  ''As far asour in-house test results indicate, the SX performs like a 16MHz computer,''said PC Designs' Skinner.andM;Despite the SX computer's initial high price, limited supply and slower32-bit software performance, industry experts see it replacing '286 or 16MHz'386 computers in the future.andM;''The closer you get to '286 prices, the sooner you have an SX world,'' saidSteve McKenzie, president of Acer Technologies Corp., a San Jose, Calif., PCmaker.andM;This will happen probably during the second half of this year, said QICResearch's Chan.andM;''The new Intel pricing will put a lot of pressure on Advanced Micro Devicesand Harris Semiconductors, which are '286 vendors,'' said Shawn Leuthold,marketing specialist for American Mitac Corp., a PC maker in San Jose, Calif.andO;''We might see a move away from 16MHz '286 computers, leaving the 12MHz '286computers and the SX product.''andM;Tom Mayes, vice president of NCR Corp.'s personal computer division inDayton, Ohio, which has been shipping its SX-based product since January,said, ''I think anything we can do to encourage '286 prospects to move is inthe customer's best interests.andP;  The customer is better off with a '386product.''andM;When SX computers begin to take off, PC makers say, 16MHz 80386 computers maybe discontinued.andM;The SX's outlook looks promising as a low-end component, according to PCmakers.andP;  ''I think it's a long-term, viable product, but it all depends onIntel's positioning and capability to produce the chip,'' said QIC's Chan.andM;While an 80386SX-based computer is not the food for power-hungry 32-bitmavens, at Coca-Cola Foods, which has standardized on 80386-based computers,80386SX-based computers represent a perfect entry-level machine.andM;''We don't want to purchase anything less than an 80386SX-based computer,except for a laptop,'' said Cheryl Currid, a PC Week columnist and manager ofdepartmental computing services for Coca-Cola Foods, a Houston-based divisionof The Coca-Cola Co. Coca-Cola started implementing its policy of purchasingonly '386 technology last November.andM;Standardizing on '386 technology is the ''most important thing we're doing,next to connectivity.andP;  It's critical for future multitasking applications,''she said.andP;  The food division purchased Compaq Computer Corp.'s Deskpro 386smodels, which are less expensive than full-blown 80386 computers but haveenough power for a Microsoft Windows user to do more than one task, she said.andM;As the new low-end standard, the 80386SX computers are being used forapplications that have limited computing requirements, she said.andP;  ''Mostexecutives don't need the speed or the high computational power of a 20MHz80386 computer.''andM;Some ReservationsandM;Despite the 80386SX's lower cost and '386 capabilities, Currid hasreservations about whether the SX chip can meet the company'shigher-performance applications.andP;  ''I don't worry about long-termcompatibility with the SX chip as I do with the '286.andP;  But you still have tobe careful.andP;  I don't think I would purchase all SX computers.''andM;Coca-Cola's '386 strategy saves the company money.andP;  ''We figured that it cost$1.67 a day to put a '386 on a user's desk, vs.andP;  $1 for a '286 computer.andP;  Ifall you do is boot up your system, you already save seven minutes, and I havemore than paid for the computer in the time I saved a user.''andM;In addition, the '386's power and speed let Coca-Cola's users multitask withseveral applications running.andP;  For example, users can search an R:base filein one window, work with Excel in another, and cut and paste data between thetwo programs.andM;''It takes all of 2 and a half minutes,'' Currid said.andP;  ''I couldn't evenbegin to estimate how long that would take without the technology.'' --andO;L.L.S.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
