For Tandy, whose personal computers were long regarded in the industry as second-class citizens among IBM clones, an agreement with Matsushita would be a major coup. Matsushita, which also sells Quasar and Technics products, has annual sales of $4.5 billion in the U.S., more than any other electronics company. The agreement would be the first time that a Japanese company has purchased personal computers made in America for sale in the U.S.    Analysts said that not only would Tandy's reputation benefit from association with a high-quality brand name, but the company would gain significant manufacturing and pricing advantages from buying huge quantities of Matsushita's memory chips.    &quot;It has the potential to place Tandy in one of the pre-eminent positions in the personal computer industry,&quot; said Jack Freeman, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group in Boston. Selling personal computers under the Panasonic label, he said, gives Tandy a widely-recognized, quality product with immense market potential.    The expected agreement with Matsushita would enhance Tandy's reputation as one of the industry's lowest-cost personal computer manufacturers. This is underscored by the fact that Matsushita already makes personal computers. Tandy &quot;has done a great job of lowering manufacturing costs,&quot; said Mr. Freeman, adding that Tandy's costs likely are as low as those of Japanese manufacturers.    The link between the two companies is the most striking example of Tandy's aggressive strategy to boost its personal computer market share. A few weeks ago, Tandy announced that Digital Equipment Corp., the second largest computer company in the U.S., would buy and sell under its own label computers made by Tandy.    Last June, Tandy teamed up with one of the nation's largest discounters, Wal-Mart stores, to broaden its distribution. Tandy previously sold its products only through its chain of 4,800 company-owned and 2,200 dealer-owned Radio Shack stores. Last year, Tandy sold 650,000 personal computers through its Radio Shack stores.    Tandy's chairman and chief executive, John Roach, titillated shareholders at the company's recent annual meeting by declaring that Tandy had signed an agreement to sell its personal computers through another big company, which he declined to name. Rumors about the identity of the other company have been circulating ever since, but Tandy executives have kept mum.    Industry marketing officials said Tandy wanted to make a big splash by breaking the news at the world's biggest computer trade show, which opens today in Las Vegas. The show is expected to draw 100,000 buyers and sellers. </TEXT></DOC>
