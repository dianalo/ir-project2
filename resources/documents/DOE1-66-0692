Some Europeans have supported thenew U.S. strategy for NATO, believing that it represents a more clearcommitment to the defense of Europe. Other Europeans, especially in theNordic countries, believe that a more active defense of northern Norwaymay be a destabilizing factor, one that could represent a dangerous provocationto the Soviet Union. They believe such a strategy would ensure Norway'sinvolvement in a U.S.-Soviety conflict. Ironically, the debate over amore vigorous NATO forward maritime strategy for the defense of northernNorway has been conducted almost totally apart from any examination ofthe growing importance of Norwegian oil and natural gas to the futureenergy security of Western Europe in the 1990s. The controversy overthe issues of NATO's political-military versus its economic interestsposes potentially serious problems for future alliance security. It istherefore essential that NATO military strategists give more considerationto the growing strategic significance of Norwegian oil and gas. One issueof growing interest to NATO defense planners is the ongoing boundarydispute between the Soviet Union and Norway in the Barents Sea (the greyzone). A detailed discussion of the dispute is presented in the chapter.It is important to understand that the way the boundary is finally delimitedhas extremely important energy and economic, as well as strategic, implications.</TEXT></DOC>
