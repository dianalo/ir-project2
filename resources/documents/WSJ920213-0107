As they filed up theramp, past the cordon of government guards and into theplane's belly, a few waved goodbye, silhouetted against thebeautiful high-rise skyline of the free port that refusedthem admission to the free world on the grounds that they are&quot;economic,&quot; not &quot;political&quot; refugees.   These 36 deportees were among the asylum seekers that U.S.Vice President Dan Quayle was referring to Monday in Genevawhen he criticized forced repatriation, saying, &quot;EveryVietnamese refugee fleeing to other places, such as HongKong, is a political refugee.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Quayle, as far as this comment goes, has it right. Thedistinction between people so poor that they flee Vietnam, asopposed to people so persecuted, is about as clear as a Hanoisewer. It is Vietnam's grossly repressive Communist systemthat keeps the people in Vietnam so poor that some will riskall they have for the chance of a better life abroad.Political and economic liberties don't exist in neat,separate compartments. They are part of the same fabric offreedom, and any government that loses sight of this axiomrisks its own society's basic values.   Sadly, that's just what Hong Kong's Refugee CoordinatorClinton Leeks was doing on the tarmac Wednesday. Mr. Leeksstepped forward to praise this peaceful eviction of 36 moreboat people as evidence that the policy of repatriatingrefugees to a Communist country is a &quot;success.&quot; Mr. Leekselaborated that the prospect of repatriation is probablydeterring many boat people who might otherwise be headingtoward Hong Kong. Only four new boat people have arrivedsince the beginning of this year, far fewer than the 600 whoarrived over the same period a year ago. It is a tragic sortof &quot;success&quot; that Mr. Leeks is celebrating.   It is also tragic that Mr. Quayle for all his wisdom hasnot followed through on the implications of his remarks aboutthe Vietnamese boat people. Hong Kong's failure to grant themhaven doesn't absolve countries such as America or Norway oranyplace -- even Japan -- from offering a home not only tothe 4,316 &quot;political&quot; refugees now in Hong Kong's camps, butalso to the 54,457 boat people termed &quot;non-refugees.&quot;   Mr. Quayle also marred his otherwise worthy remarks Mondayby saying that Haitians seeking asylum in the U.S. aresomehow real &quot;economic&quot; migrants, and therefore lessdeserving of refuge than Vietnamese cruising into Hong Kong.It seems more and more that among the politicians of the freeworld, refugees are being defined out of existence.   It may be that if every man, woman and child in everypoor, repressed country of the world arrived at the samemoment in Hong Kong or Kyoto or Miami, there would begridlock. But no such emergency is in the offing. There isplenty of room in the free world to absorb people who fleerepressive nations. These travelers understand that theirtalents and energies can be put to more productive uses inAmerica or Hong Kong than in Haiti or Vietnam.   The sight of the forced-deportation plane taking offWednesday from Hong Kong, bound for Communist Vietnam, shamesthe modern world. To celebrate this act as a &quot;success,&quot;achieved under the banner of absurd semantic distinctions,compounds this terrible wrong.</TEXT></DOC>
