 Some buyers, however, warn that the migration pathto an AS/400 can be difficult and contend that some AS/400 software needsimprovement.andM;Buyers who are most pleased with the AS/400 are using the system forvertical-market database applications, which require speed and large amountsof storage.andM;At Spartanburg Regional Medical Center in Spartanburg, S.C., more than 350devices, including workstations and printers, are connected to an AS/400 B60system, which has 96M bytes of memory and 10 gigabytes of storage.andM;The AS/400 is used for applications such as accounts payable and receivable,payroll and inventory control, according to Lance Taylor, the supervisor ofcomputer operations at the medical center.andM;Taylor said that the new system performs well when compared with the medicalcenter's IBM System/38, which was used before upgrading to the AS/400.andO;&quot;We've noticed a 2-to-1 speed increase on some of the batch jobs we'resending through to the [AS/400],&quot; he said.andM;Taylor opted for the AS/400 mainly for ease of migration, since the operatingsystems of both the System/38 and AS/400 have a similar integrated relationaldatabase.andP;  In addition, he needed the AS/400's speed and storage capacity.andM;But even greater speed and storage capacity is needed, said Taylor, who plansto integrate the medical center's pharmacy system with the existing AS/400setup.andP;  &quot;We've almost maxed the B60 model,&quot; he said, &quot;so now we're waitingfor another [AS/400 model] to come out.&quot;andM;When faced with a decision between upgrading from a System/36 to an AS/400 orchanging to a LAN environment, Marvin Arno, information-systems specialistfor Westmill Clothes Inc., a clothing maker in Woodside, N.Y., opted for theAS/400.andM;Westmill Clothes uses the AS/400 for database applications only, Arno said.andO;&quot;Perhaps we'll use a LAN in the future for applications that don't need muchmemory.&quot;andM;Arno added that a LAN would be more difficult to configure, primarily becausesystems administrators at the company are more knowledgeable about IBM'smidrange systems.andM;Upgrading to the AS/400 proved easy for Arno.andP;  &quot;Actual installation was abreeze,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Putting on peripherals with a System/36 requires changingthe [system] configuration.andP;  To do this, you have to bring the system downand bring it back up again.andM;&quot;With AS/400, you just plug the peripheral into the particular port, and thesystem recognizes it without a change of configuration,&quot; he said.andM;For optimal performance, however, System/36 application software should berewritten in RPG III, or Native Code, Arno added.andP;  The software code for theSystem/36 is different from that used for both System/38 and AS/400.andO;System/36 software can be run on the AS/400 without being modified, butmaximum application speed will not be achieved.andM;While the majority of buyers who upgraded from an IBM System/38 to an AS/400said the transition was easy, few System/36 users interviewed were as pleasedas Arno with the migration path.andM;&quot;IBM is having trouble getting the System/36 people to like the AS/400,&quot; saidAlan Brandt, product marketing manager for Computer Lab International Inc., amanufacturer of peripherals for the AS/400 in Anaheim, Calif.andM;In comparison, Brandt said, upgrading from a System/38 to AS/400 is easy.andO;&quot;The AS/400 has the same mentality as a System/38.&quot;andM;Computer Lab currently has an AS/400 connected to a System/36.andP;  Terminals andPCs -- local and remote -- are linked to these systems.andM;According to Brandt, when upgrading from a System/36 to an AS/400, the AS/400is much more difficult to operate, from a user's standpoint, than theSystem/36.andM;&quot;You can run a System/36 without an operator -- no one touches it except atthe end of the day to run a backup,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;With an AS/400, you need tohave someone who's trained as an operator to run the same applications youuse [with a System/36].&quot;andM;For example, Brandt said, the AS/400's print-queuing process is complex.andP;  &quot;IfI want to print on a System/36, I send a job to the printer; it sits on aspool and is sent out,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;When using the AS/400, there are morelevels to check -- input queue, job queue, print queue.andP;  You have layer uponlayer of system to go through.&quot;andM;The System/38 also requires an operator, Brandt noted, so users migrating toan AS/400 will already have the necessary staff available.andM;Rewriting System/36 software in Native Code to increase application speed onthe AS/400 is another inconvenience, said Brandt.andM;Other complaints are targeted at IBM's AS/400 software.andP;  For example, someusers found PC Support lacking.andP;  PC Support provides many of AS/400'sconnectivity options, and bridges the PC and AS/400 architectures.andP;  (Seediagram, facing page.)andM;According to Donald Burdette, senior programmer analyst at Expedata Inc., anAS/400 consulting firm and a computer-product remarketer in Fresno, Calif.,andO;many of his clients find PC Support difficult to use.andP;  &quot;It's a complex tool,&quot;he said.andP;  &quot;Most people can't figure out how to use it.&quot;andM;In addition, &quot;Once you get all the [PC Support] modules loaded, there's notenough memory to do anything productive,&quot; he added.andM;PC Support performance can be a problem as well.andP;  &quot;Overall, [PC Support] ispretty poor in performance, depending on the number of PC Support modulesthat are used,&quot; Burdette said.andP;  If only one PC Support module is running on aPC, then performance is satisfactory, he explained.andP;  However, if severalmodules are loaded, performance decreases, because of the larger amount ofmemory needed.andM;Computer Lab's Brandt agreed.andP;  &quot;I've used PC Support extensively.andP;  It'sterribly slow running on the AS/400, and it takes over the entire PC,&quot; hesaid.andM;Another AS/400 software program needing improvement is AS/400 Office wordprocessor, some buyers said.andM;A senior systems programmer for an educational institution in South Dakota,who wished to remain anonymous, experienced serious problems when he boughtan AS/400 system primarily for word processing and also database andcommunications.andP;  The educational institution has a statewide network,comprising an AS/400, numerous System/36s, IBM mainframes and PCs.andM;&quot;IBM talked us into AS/400, but it [doesn't] fit our needs,&quot; the programmersaid, adding that investing in AS/400 mainly for word processing set theinstitution back by at least six months.andP;  &quot;It's been a huge expense in stafftime.andM;&quot;Office has a slow response time per keystroke,&quot; the programmer said.andO;&quot;Sometimes when our typists are trying to move the cursor down the page, theyhave a five-second lag before the [screen moves].andM;&quot;We're looking to replace the [AS/400] with a PC network, or with a supermicro server or mini-based server,&quot; the programmer added.andM;Computer Lab's Brandt has had similar problems with Office.andP;  &quot;Word processingis much easier and faster on the PC,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;[Office] is terriblyslow -- it has the same problems as DisplayWrite.andP;  You wind up uploading anddownloading files all the time.&quot;andM;Office does provide good functionality, he added, but its slow speed preventsusers from taking full advantage of it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
