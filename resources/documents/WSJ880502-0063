The shift beclouds the outlook for the Pentagon's most costly and far-reaching weapons project, the Strategic Defense Initiative, designed to intercept ballistic missiles in space. U.S. strategists warn that even if President Reagan some day realizes his dream of deploying a &quot;peace shield&quot; in space, the Soviets will probably be in a position to unleash a force of bombers and cruise missiles that could sneak under the protective umbrella.    Unlike some complex counter-measures the Soviets might use to foil SDI, or Star Wars, the bombers and cruise missiles would simply bypass the defense system.    By focusing on the gap in U.S. defenses, Moscow presents the U.S. with an uncomfortable choice: to admit that even a perfectly functioning Star Wars system would only counter part of the Soviet nuclear threat; or to complement the strategic defense system with a very costly air-defense network to block low-level attacks.    &quot;It makes no sense to deploy SDI as long as there is no defense against the emerging air-breathing threat,&quot; weapons powered by jet engines rather than by rockets, says Loren Thompson of Georgetown University's national security studies program.    The Heritage Foundation has singled out the absence of a U.S. air-defense system as one of four big military problems the next administration will have to confront. Kim Holmes, a military analyst at the conservative think tank, calls for the U.S. to deploy more tactical fighter planes, as well as modernized Patriot ground-to-air missiles. But he concedes that budget pressures weigh against such a buildup.    The Soviet planes and cruise missiles, meanwhile, have become harder to track and intercept. The Russian AS-15, a cruise missile that can travel about 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), became operational in 1984. The missiles can be mounted on Bear-H bombers, which can fire at a safe distance from their targets. U.S. F-15 pilots in Alaska report a sharp increase in the number of Bear-H bombers conducting exercises. Mr. Thompson estimates that by 1991, the Soviets will have more than 100 Bear-H bombers, along with about 1,000 AS-15 cruise missiles.    The Soviets have deployed cruise missiles that can be launched from any of the three newest classes of submarines. These submarines are significantly quieter than the boats they are replacing, and thus able to travel closer to the U.S. coastlines.    Pentagon officials say that the newest Soviet cruise missiles carry accurate terrain-reading guidance systems similar to those in U.S. cruise missiles. The Soviets are also designing a long-range supersonic cruise missile that would be more difficult to intercept.    The latest edition of &quot;Soviet Military Power,&quot; released by the Pentagon Friday, says the Soviets have produced 11 Blackjack bombers, which resemble the U.S. B-1 swept-wing bomber. The publication says that with the Blackjack and the Bear-H bombers, the Soviet &quot;intercontinental bomber force is more flexible than it has ever been.&quot; The Pentagon report noted that the two aircraft could be refueled in flight by the Midas tanker plane, fielded in 1987.    U.S. worries about these new weapons may turn out to be unnecessary, like the missile and bomber gaps of past eras. Intelligence assessments have found that the Soviets often hit technological snarls building big supersonic bombers like the Blackjack. Although the Pentagon for several years has been predicting that the Blackjack was about to surge into full production, this hasn't happened. One Defense Department official says, &quot;We think it's in the realm of being deployed.&quot;    Though the bombers and cruise missiles still only represent about 10% of the Soviets' total nuclear arsenal, the low-flying systems could mount a decapitating strike on U.S. command and control centers the President would rely on during a crisis.    Thirty years ago, the U.S. maintained a broad network of radars, interceptor planes, and ground-to-air missiles to thwart a feared Soviet bomber attack. But in the 1960s, when both superpowers were building up ballistic missiles that could rain warheads down from space, the U.S. decided against sinking money into what would be only a partial defense. In the 1990s, the Pentagon could be faced with the opposite problem -- being able to deflect nuclear attacks in space but not inside the atmosphere.    U.S. military planners are taking some steps to lessen the disparity. The Pentagon is installing modern radar equipment along the aging Distant Early Warning line in northern Canada. Powerful radar equipment is being designed for the coastlines as well, and the Air Force is buying General Dynamics Corp. F-16s to replace old interceptor planes.    However, strategists say these moves fall far short of providing a comprehensive defense against the Soviet's newest low-flying weapons. Under pressure from Congress, the Pentagon has set up an Air Defense Initiative to study high-tech approaches. However, this project has only attracted a fraction of the funds dedicated to the better-known SDI.    &quot;The Air Force has never been very excited about the air-defense mission,&quot; says one Pentagon official. He notes that under budget pressures, the service generally chops air-defense projects to keep money flowing to bombers and fighter jets.    Some analysts argue that building a complex U.S. air-defense system could be a waste of money. The Soviets have spent billions setting up air defenses; but the Pentagon claims its low-flying B-1 bomber, Stealth bomber and advanced cruise missiles can get through the thicket of defenses. Pointing to what may turn out to be wasted expenditures by the Soviets, a House aide says, &quot;We're not going to clamor for a big increase.&quot;    ---                       U.S. Air Defenses                             Early 1960s          Today    Interceptor planes             2,612            252    Air Force surface-to-    air missiles                     439              0    Army surface-to-    air missile batteries            274              0    Air defense    control centers                   68              7   Source: Georgetown University National Security Studies Program</TEXT></DOC>
