Earlier NASA research had noted performance degradationof up to 24% for the MOD-OA. The Solar Energy Research Institute hasfunded a study to examine the effect of precipitation on the performanceof a wind turbine with a similar airfoil (23,000 series) in an operatingwindfarm. The objective of this study is to collect sufficient data atwindfarm on the southern Oregon coast, where rainfall occurs frequently,so that the effect of precipitation can be discriminated from the effectsof turbulence that may be associated with rain. The rainfall rates areconsiderably lower than the rates of rainfall considered in the previousNASA study. The rainfall rates experienced at Whisky Run are generallyless than 8mm/hr would most of the time fall under the light rain classificationof the previous studies. For light rain conditions, Corrigan and Demiglioobserved as much as a 18% decrease in performance. This study did notshow a decrease in performance due to light rain, but rather a slightincrease of approximately 3%. The 3% increase maybe attributable to areduction of blade roughness, anemometer error, when wet or a combinationof these. The general conclusion of this study is that for the ESI-54wind turbine located at Whisky Run when it experiences rainfall ratesgenerally less than 8mm/hr., rain has a beneficial effect on performanceby maintaining clean blades and slightly improving their aerodynamicproperties.</TEXT></DOC>
