<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-76-0568 </DOCNO><TEXT>Several fuel-loading concepts are proposed for high-temperature reactorsof the pebble-bed type. A very promising one is the so-called OTTO (oncethrough then out) loading scheme. Some of the intrinsic features of OTTOfuel loading are the axial nonsymmetrical power and neutron flux distributionwith a pronounced maximum at the upper reactor core region. Since theneutron physics of OTTO cores will be very different from previous homogeneousfuel-loading schemes, detailed experimental and theoretical investigationsof these objectives were performed at the critical facility KAHTER. Experimentaland theoretical investigations have been carried out to determine criticalmasses, reaction rates, and control rod worths in the upper cavity andtop reflector. Fast flux distribution in upper graphite reflectors werealso measured to estimate graphite damage. The critical masses and k/subeff/'s are calculated using two- and three-dimensional code systems.The three-dimensional codes give k/sub eff/ values for the high-temperaturegas-cooled reactor OTTO cores at zero burnup within a margin that iscurrently standard for these calculations. The agreement of measuredand calculated reactivity worths of the top reflector rods is betterthan 2%.</TEXT></DOC>
