Bull mainframes running Bull's proprietary GCOS 8; Bullmidrange systems running GCOS 7; Bull multiuser systems running Unix; Bullsmall-business systems running GCOS 4 and GCOS 6; Bull microcomputers runningMS-DOS.andM;Network protocols supported: Proprietary Bull protocols (P 200, VIP 7800,XCP2); NCS; NFS; Open Systems Interconnection (OSI); TCP/IP.andM;User interfaces supported: IBM's Dialog Manager programming interface,Microsoft Corp. Windows, Motif, Presentation Manager.andM;Types of services provided: multivendor MHS (message handling system) andFTAM (file transfer, access and management); network management andinformation management; distributed printing; multimedia storage.andP;  Complianceprocedures: Adherence to international standards put forth by theInternational Standards Organization (ISO), the Corporation for Open Systems(COS), Standards Promotion and Application Group (SPAG), Promoting Conferencefor OSI (POSI) and Cencenelec assures compliance with DSA, Bull says.andO;[DIAGRAM OMITTED]andM;COMPANY: Control DataandM;ARCHITECTURE: CDC transparent-computing environmentandM;Control Data Corp. (CDC) doesn't have a single acronym that represents itsevolving transparent computing environment.andP;  The company, instead, talksabout its &quot;federated computing&quot; strategy as being &quot;the flip side ofdistributed computing.&quot; A few CDC products currently take advantage of theclient-server computing model (for instance, its network archive system); CDCwill be reengineering other products to take advantage of this model.andM;Its 8-year-old EDL integration tool is at the heart of CDC's evolution.andP;  EDLsoftware acts as a buffer between users and underlying operating systems andnetworking architectures.andP;  It enables users to share technical informationmore or less transparently across CDC and other vendors' platforms.andM;At the same time, CDC is folding into its architecture other massive data-and information-management products, such as its large-scale relationaldatabase management system, CDM (common Data Model) Plus.andP;  This system wasdeveloped by CDC in its early government contracting days.andM;&quot;We're trying to be architecture-neutral,&quot; says Kenneth Amann, a principalconsultant in the company's information-management group.andP;  &quot;At a base level,our products can fit into other industry-standard environments.andP;  On top ofthat, we'll provide other levels of integration.&quot;andM;Platforms supported: (Note: CDC is in the process of developing aclient-server architecture.) Cyber mainframes running NOS/VE  CDC'sproprietary operating system); CDC 4000 departmental systems running CDC'sUnix, called Classix; Unix-based workstations from scientific/engineeringvendors, including CDC, DEC, IBM, Hewlett-Packard Co., Sun Microsystems Inc.;andO;3270s and other terminals.andM;Network protocols supported: UltraNet, CDCNet, NFS, OSI, RPC, TCP/IP; linksto IBM's SNA and DEC's DECnet.andM;User interfaces supported: Curses proprietary NOS/VSE interface), Motif,Xterminal, X Windows, third-party desktop managers.andM;Types of services provided: Operating system services, including storage andnetwork access (via Express Link); database management (via CDM Plus);application development environment management; application integration andadministrative automation (via CDC's EDL tool).andM;Compliance procedures: Adherence to standards put forth by COS, UnixInternational (UI) and ATandamp;T with its SVID, is the key factor.andP;  CDC has alsodeveloped and employed test suites to ensure compliance with its emergingarchitecture.andP;  And it is in the process of documenting available userinterfaces that comply, as well.andP;  [DIAGRAM OMITTED]andM;COMPANY: Data GeneralandM;ARCHITECTURE: DAA (Distributed Applications Architecture)andM;Data General Corp. (DG) had been talking about and moving toward adistributed-computing architecture for some time before it formally announcedDAA in 1988.andP;  But it wasn't until last fall, when it rolled out CEO ObjectOffice-its first major DAA application-that DG really began to push DAA asthe crux of its computing strategy.andP;  It added another crucial component inJanuary 1990 when it introduced its &quot;Open LAN&quot; products and strategy, whileunveiling its marketing/technology agreements with Novell Inc.. Novellsupplies NetWare for all of DG's DAA platforms.andP;  DG says it plans to supportLan Manager and Lan Manager X.andM;And DG is playing up its object-management expertise with DAA.andP;  It's a memberof the Object Management Group and a licensee of HP's NewWave object-baseduser environment.andP;  CEO Object Office is an object-based version of itsflagship CEO office-automation software.andM;Simultaneously, DG is gunning to be a key contender in the Unix and RISC(reduced instruction set computer) environments.andP;  As a result, it is focusingDAA around its Motorola Inc.'s 88000-based Aviion systems andIBM-PC-compatible Dasher PCs.andM;Servers supported: DG Eclipse MV/Family of minicomputers running AOS/VS (DG'sproprietary OS); DG Aviion systems running DG/UX (DG's Unix); ultimately,other vendors' Unix systems.andM;Clients supported: Workstations running Unix; PCs running OS/2, DOS and MacOS; X-terminals; and asynchronous terminals.andM;Network protocols supported: DG's Xodiac Transport Service (XTS) networkingarchitecture, OSI, RPC, SNA, TCP/IP.andM;User interfaces supported: Motif, NewWave, Presentation Manager, X Windows.andM;Types of services provided: Basic backplane (directory, authentication,notification, object database, filing, network management); office automation(mail, printing, queue management, calendaring and scheduling);integrated/extended applications (document routing and tracking,hyper-filing, imaging).andM;Compliance procedures: DG supports two levels of compliance.andP;  DAA canaccommodate off-the-shelf shrink-wrap software using the object-managementprocess known as encapsulation.andP;  Otherwise, compliance is achieved by writingto DAA APIS, which are described in the DG DAA documentation.andP;  [DIAGRAMOMITTED]andM;COMPANY: Digital EquipmentandM;ARCHITECTURE: NAS (Network Application Support)andM;DEC's NAS is one of the most complete and cohesive of all the enterprisearchitectures.andP;  Reason: DEC has always run one primary operating system, VMS,on its VAX family of workstations and minicomputers.andM;Consequently, DEC is able to focus most of its architectural attention onmaking its products, tools and interfaces available across heterogeneousplatforms.andP;  It has begun this task in its own backyard, by working to makeall NAS products available more or less simultaneously on VMS and Ultrix(DEC's version of Unix) systems.andM;And DEC introduced phase one of NAS in early 1988.andP;  Today, DEC claims thatapproximately 500 ISVs are developing NAS software, and 400 NAS-compliantapplications are shipping.andP;  DEC is bundling 50 of these applications togetherwith hardware to cover specific vertical niches and calling them ApplicationIntegrated Solutions.andM;NAS marketing manager, Jacqueline Kahle, says that the next areas DEC plansto address within NAS are content-based retrieval services (for large textsearches) and general distributed-system services (such as naming, security,authentication and threads).andM;Servers supported: IBM mainframes; CISC (complex instruction set computer)and RISC-based VAXes running VMS and Ultrix; PCs running OS/2 (currently forfile sharing and printing only).andM;Clients supported: Midrange systems running VMS, Unix, Ultrix; PCs runningOS/2 and MS-DOS; DEC VT and IBM 3270 terminals.andM;Network protocols supported: DECnet, OSI, TCP/IP (with links and gateways toSNA).andM;User interfaces supported: Motif, X Windows, Microsoft Windows, Mac Windows,Presentation Manager.andM;Types of services provided: Applications access (for example, windowing);communications (like electronic data interchange-EDI); information andresource sharing, such as CDA (Compound Document Architecture) and systemservices (like interfaces to POSIX).andM;Compliance procedures: No formal compliance testing is required.andP;  DEC'ssystems engineering group is doing some systems-level testing for third-partyand in-house-developed applications that are part of DEC's ApplicationIntegrated Solutions.andP;  [DIAGRAM OMITTED]andM;COMPANY: Hewlett-PackardandM;ARCHITECTURE: NWC (NewWave Computing)andM;Unlike vendors that outline their entire enterprise computing strategies andthen fill in the pieces, HP has done the reverse.andP;  It has developed productssuch as HP NewWave Office, HP Team Computing, HP OpenView software and itsPrecision Architecture RISC servers over the past few years.andP;  Then, in March,it rolled out NWC.andM;HP insists that its &quot;architectural framework&quot; differs in both philosophy andimplementation from all other architectures.andP;  &quot;We don't have a set of APIsand rules,&quot; says Dave Butt, marketing manager for NWC.andP;  Instead, hemaintains, &quot;Everybody who is onboard with HP today is already part of our NWCenvironment.&quot;andM;To date, about 90 ISVs have come out in support of NewWave, HP says.andP;  And HPitself is developing integrated application environments that are based onNWC.andP;  The first three are NWC for business management; NWC for engineering;and NWC for manufacturing, called OpenCIM.andM;Another difference between NWC and other architectures is that its core isnot based on internationally sanctioned standards.andP;  Instead, NWC rests on twoHP-developed technologies.andP;  Both are being considered as standards by the OSFand X/Open: object-management facilities for distributed-applicationintegration and NCS for distributed-network integration developed by HP'sApollo subsidiary.andM;Servers supported: CISC- and RISC-based midrange systems running MPE (HP'sproprietary system), HP/UX (HP's Unix), DEC's VMS and other operatingsystems; PCs running OS/2.andM;Clients supported: Unix-based workstations; PCs running OS/2 and MS-DOS;X-terminals.andP;  (HP uses &quot;enablers,&quot; or architected services, to act asinterfaces between clients and servers by employing the RPC facility.)andM;Network protocols supported: NCS, OSI, RPC, TCP/IP.andM;User interfaces supported: Motif, NewWave, Presentation Manager, X-terminal,X Windows.andM;Types of services provided: Information access, computer resource sharing,application integration and network management.andP;  HP provides these servicesvia distributed-object services (consisting of object-management and monitorand control facilities) and networked-system services (including distributedsystem, information storage and network/system-management services).andM;Compliance procedures: Ultimately, HP is talking about creating a definitiveset of compliance recommendations.andP;  For now, there isn't a set of APIs orrules to which adherence makes NWC compliance automatic.andP;  Instead, properunderstanding and implementation of object technology and NCS are the keys,according to HP.andP;  [DIAGRAM OMITTED]andM;COMPANY: IBMandM;ARCHITECTURE: SAA (Systems Application Architecture)andM;SAA bears the twin distinctions of being the best-known and one of the leastambitious of the system architectures.andP;  IBM instituted SAA in 1987 to letdevelopers and customers know that it was serious about eliminatingincompatibility among its own systems.andM;Initially, Big Blue didn't include multivendor compatibility as one of itsgoals for SAA.andP;  It made its first step toward expanding its architecture toinclude heterogeneous system support in February.andP;  At that time, it unveiledits strategies for bringing Unix systems (AIX) under the SAA umbrella-mainlyvia its RS/6000 RISC workstation product family.andM;&quot;It's unlikely we'll ever try to identify and move all the AIX platforms andprotocols into the SAA environment-it would destroy the Unix-ness of AIX,&quot;points out George Zagelow, manager of architecture and standards at IBM'sSanta Teresa lab in San Jose, Calif &quot;We'll provide two parallel efforts withoverlap and connectivity where it makes sense.&quot;andM;Throughout its evolution, SAA has maintained the same basic structure.andP;  Itconsists of three main pieces: Common Communications Support (CCS), CommonProgramming Interface (CPI) and CUA.andP;  On top of these run commonapplications, such as the Office Vision suite of office-automation products,the A/D Cycle family of CASE tools and the expected family of SAA-compliantsystems-management tools.andM;CCS-the piece that builds upon SNA peer-to-peer connectivity using LU 6.2 andother networking tools-is the area where systems integrators are likely toconcentrate.andM;Servers supported: IBM System/370 mainframes running TSO/E, VM/CMS, and VM/EA(with limited support for System/370s running CICS/MVS and IMXS/VS); IBMAS/400 minicomputers running OS/400 (with limited support for IBM RS/6000workstations running AIX); IBM PCs running OS/2 EE (Extended Edition).andM;Clients supported: PCs running OS/2 and DOS; 3270 terminals; limited supportfor IBM RS/6000 workstations.andM;Network protocols supported: OSI, SNA (with primary focus on LU 6.2) andTCP/IP (via AIX).andM;User interfaces supported: IBM's Dialog Manager and CPI-C (Common ProgrammingInterface-Communications) programming interfaces, Presentation Manager, Motifand NeXT Inc.'s NeXTStep (both limitedly supported under AIX).andM;Types of services provided: Distributed relational database management system(RDBMS) access, distributed record-oriented file access andprogram-to-program communication.andP;  Included among these general categoriesare more specific services, such as document interchange (via IBM's DocumentInterchange Architecture) and SNA network management.andP;  Other potentialservices that are currently being examined by Big Blue: RPC capability,Dialog Manager to the Presentation Manager communications interface.andO;Compliance procedures: IBM has backed away from its initial idea of imposingsome type of compliance testing for SAA.andP;  Instead, it has provided a 32-itemchecklist and various test suites for developers and users as a method ofensuring SAA adherence.andP;  [DIAGRAM OMITTED]andM;COMPANY: NCRandM;ARCHITECTURE: OCCA (Open, Cooperative Computing Architecture)andM;NCR's experience with client-server computing harks back to 1985, when itintroduced a distributed bank-automation product called FTS (Financial TowerSystem).andP;  OCCA, which made its debut in February, is the company's firstforay into the more general-purpose client-server environment.andM;In its final form, OCCA will support all of the latest and greatesttechnologies-object-management, integrated-network management, multimediaaccess and image processing.andP;  In the shorter term, &quot;We're moving standardizedclient-server products to the open systems world,&quot; claims Darrell Clark,senior vice president of the integrated systems group.andM;Like IBM did following introduction of its SAA framework, NCR is rolling outsuites of homegrown application software tailor-made for its architecture.andO;Its first such offering, the Cooperation series of officeinformation-management tools-including X.400 gateways, a compound-documenteditor and SQL database-access aids-is scheduled to ship during the secondhalf of this year.andP;  HP's NewWave and NCR's GUI (graphical user interface),NCR Desktop, will provide the front ends for services and platforms includedunder Cooperation.andP;  First releases should hit the street during the secondquarter.andP;  Servers supported: NCR Towers and other vendors' midrange systemsrunning Unix; NCR and other vendors' PCs running Unix, OS/2.andM;Clients supported: NCR and other PCs running Unix, OS/2 and DOS.andP;  Networkprotocols supported: DEC VT100/200 emulations, IBM's 3270, IBM's SNA, OSI andTCP/IP.andM;User interfaces supported: HP's NewWave, Microsoft Windows, Motif, NCR'sDesktop and IBM's Presentation Manager.andM;Types of services provided: Information (database access, compound document,mail); application (network print); network delivery (object distribution,mail and FAX gateways); system management (network software management);system support (automated-service delivery and system analysis).andM;Compliance procedures: Developers that write to NCR's APIs and the overallOCCA spec outlined in the application developers' guide will comply withOCCA.andP;  NCR works closely with third-party integrators on OCCA.andP;  In-house NCRdivisions are doing most of the retail, financial and office-automationintegration for customers, so it's their job to make sure installationscomply with OCCA.andP;  [DIAGRAM OMITTED]andM;COMPANY: UnisysandM;ARCHITECTURE: Unisys ArchitectureandM;Come September, Unisys is slated to unveil the three-letter acronym thatrepresents its years of architectural integration.andP;  This effort began in1986, when Burroughs Inc. and Sperry Corp. merged to form Unisys.andM;&quot;We're looking at the enterprise-, or even multienterprise-wide world,&quot; saysPeter Bakalor, vice president of strategy and analysis.andP;  &quot;We've beendeveloping tools for various systems all along, including some for othervendors' equipment.andP;  Now we're working on giving users an architecturalapproach to these tools.&quot;andM;Like other computer vendors, Unisys is doing its best to adhere toestablished international standards.andP;  In cases where final standards don'tyet exist-such as distributed-transaction processing and high-performance,object-oriented databases-Unisys still is moving forward &quot;and will conform asstandards settle down,&quot; Bakalor says.andM;Servers supported: Unisys A Series (running its proprietary MCP operatingsystem) and 2200 (running OS/1100) mainframes; midrange systems running Unix,and MCP/VS, OS/3  Unisys' proprietary operating systems); workgroup systemsrunning Unix, BTOS, CTOS, OS/2 and/or MS-DOS.andM;Clients supported: Midrange systems running Unix; workgroup systems runningUnix, BTOS, CTOS, OS/2 and MS-DOS.andM;Network protocols supported: BNA (Burroughs Network Architecture), DCA(Unisys' Distributed Communications Architecture), OSI, TCP/IP and SNA(transport support).andM;User interfaces supported: Microsoft Windows, Motif and Presentation Manager.andM;Types of services provided: Distributed systems (like EDI); informationmanagement (such as distributed-database management); integrated applicationsand information (such as CASE and fourth-generation language [4GL] tools);systems connectivity (tools for LANs, metropolitan area networks [MANs] andwide area networks [WANs]); and systems management (such as security,performance and monitoring).andM;Compliance procedures: Unisys isn't planning to certify third-party software.andO;Instead, it is advising companies to adhere to X/Open's XPG (X/OpenPortability Guide) and the National Institute of Standards and Technologies(NIST) POSIX guidelines.andM;To ensure even further compliance, Unisys suggests vendors use itsapplication generation tools and/or develop products using its APIs.andO;[DIAGRAM OMITTED]andM;COMPANY: Wang LaboratoriesandM;ARCHITECTURE: OPEN/Architecture)andM;Wang has been talking about architectures (specifically SAA) since 1988, whenit announced a suite of products compatible with IBM's SNA and NetViewnetwork-management system.andP;  It wasn't until December 1989 that it rolled outis own OPEN/Architecture strategy as part of a corporate-wide reorganizationand commitment to Unix.andM;Unlike other vendors facing head-on the monumental task of bringingproprietary systems into the open systems fold, Wang is in the process ofrefocusing the corporation.andP;  Consequently, it is downplaying its proprietaryVS line and highlighting its newer Unix servers and IBM-compatible PCs as theprimary platforms for OPEN/Architecture.andP;  At this point, Wang's mosttangible, leverageable OPEN/Architecture products are its Unix servers andits OPEN/Image imaging software.andM;Desktop imaging will be provided by OPEN Image Windows and Wang's Freestyleinterface; host-based imaging will come via OPEN Image CICS.andP;  Wang'sIntegrated Image System (WITS) will act as a departmental link, and inconjunction with NetWare and ISDN bridges for Freestyle, will provideenterprise-wide connectivity.andM;Wang is simplifying access to OPEN/Image by writing standards-based imagingAPIs and working with third-party database and network vendors to develop newimaging applications.andM;&quot;We're not asking you to write or code new applications or to change yourapplications,&quot; maintains Gerry Paul, vice president of systems-platformengineering.andP;  But in order to protect the investments of its traditionalminicomputer customers, Wang is reengineering its &quot;core&quot; applications, suchas Wang OFFICE electronic mail, its PACE application-development/DBMSenvironment and the text-processing software, to the client-server-basedOPEN/Architecture.andM;So far, 24 ISVs have adapted their products to be compliant with theOPEN/Architecture.andM;Servers supported: Midrange systems running VS (Wang's proprietary operatingsystem) or Unix; PCs running OS/2.andM;Clients supported: Microcomputers running Mac OS, MS-DOS, OS/2 and Unix;character-based workstations.andP;  Network protocols supported: OSI, SNA andTCP/IP.andM;User interfaces supported: Microsoft Windows, Motif, Presentation Manager andX Windows.andM;Types of services provided: Distributed operating system (such as name anddirectory, security, licensing, file and print services); distributeddatabase; and distributed office-function services.andP;  Compliance procedures:Wang says it will be publishing &quot;minimal subset documentation&quot; this summer:It is working with its partners and customers on what should be included.andM;Companies mentioned in this articleandM;AGS information Services inc.andM;1139 Spruce DriveandM;Mountainside, N.J.andP;
