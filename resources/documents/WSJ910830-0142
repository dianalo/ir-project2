Morgan Stanley, which settled the charges withoutadmitting or denying wrongdoing, agreed to accept a slap onthe wrist in which the only remedy is that its generalcounsel must review the firm's procedures to be sure thatthey comply with SEC rules. Findings must then be reported tothe firm and the SEC, and any recommendations must beimplemented.</LP><TEXT>   The charges, filed by the SEC in March, became somethingof a cause celebre in the legal community and within theagency, partly because of a long statement written by SECCommissioner Edward Fleischman that took the agency to taskfor how it communicates with Wall Street and others.Moreover, many securities lawyers blasted the SEC for beingon shaky legal ground.   The charges centered on Morgan Stanley's liquidation ofKaiserTech Ltd. stock that the firm held as collateralagainst the margin-trading account of Alan Clore, thealuminum company's former chairman and chief executiveofficer. Just days after the October 1987 crash, MorganStanley sold 2.4 million shares of KaiserTech, or about 4% ofthe stock outstanding, because the stock price had fallen andno longer covered the account's margin requirements.   But the shares were &quot;control stock,&quot; the SEC charged, orstock that made up part of Mr. Clore's controlling stake inKaiserTech. So when Morgan Stanley sold the shares, it wasdoing an underwriting without filing proper statements withthe SEC, thus violating securities laws, the agency said.   At the time, Morgan Stanley countered that it sold theshares &quot;in good faith after consulting with outside counsel.&quot;Moreover, it argued that a series of directives issued by theSEC staff to other firms provided road maps for similarsituations. Morgan Stanley had said it planned to fight thecharges. But since then, the firm apparently decided itwanted to avoid a drawn-out fight with its regulator and thatthe sanctions were light enough.   After the settlement, Morgan, a unit of the Morgan StanleyGroup Inc., said it is &quot;pleased that this matter has beenresolved with the SEC in a manner that is mutuallysatisfactory. We are also pleased that the settlementreflects a recognition that Morgan Stanley acted in goodfaith and did not intend to violate the law.&quot;   In its March complaint, the SEC issued only a bare-bones,one-page description of the case. But attached to the chargeswas an eight-page diatribe from Commissioner Fleischmantaking the agency to task for what he said was a reversal ofthe longstanding policy of guiding Wall Street through staffdirectives. He didn't refer directly to the Morgan situation.   Mr. Fleischman won't say whether he agrees with theagency's enforcement action, but said he wanted to explainhis objection to the SEC's process. Senior staffers andcommissioners said they tried to persuade Mr. Fleischman tooffer his views on the matter in another forum, such as aspeech, because they couldn't rebut his charges in theenforcement action. In the action, which is an administrativeproceeding, the commission is the appeals body if either sidedoesn't like the decision of the administrative law judgeassigned to the case. So as possible future judges,commission members needed to remain mum.   Once Mr. Fleischman issued his argument, his view quicklyspread through the legal community, with many senior membersof the defense bar offering analyses on whether the SEC hadchanged its longstanding policy.   SEC officials contend that the agency's prior opinionsoffered no protection for the firm because the lettersclearly state that Morgan or Mr. Clore would have needed tohold the stock for three years for the sale to be legal. Andagency officials implied that Morgan or its counsel shouldhave known that. &quot;We don't have the impression there wasgreat confusion in the brokerage community on how these{guidance} letters should be applied,&quot; said AssociateEnforcement Director Harry Weiss. &quot;If there was anyconfusion, there isn't now.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
