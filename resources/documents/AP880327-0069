(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Assemblies of God hopes to lay theJimmy Swaggart scandal to rest after the church's highest governingbody meets Monday to discipline the television minister for analleged relationship with a prostitute.   The Pentecostal denomination's 250-member General Presbytery ischarged with resolving the conflict between the ExecutivePresbytery, the church's 13-member national board of directors, andchurch officials in Louisiana who have proposed what some say istoo lenient a punishment for Swaggart.   Swaggart, the denomination's most prominent minister, confessedFeb. 21 from his Baton Rouge, La., pulpit to unspecified sins.Swaggart did not elaborate publicly, but reports have linked him tovoyeurism involving a prostitute.   Swaggart, who addressed his congregation briefly in Baton Rougeon Sunday, as he has done several times since formallyrelinquishing the pulpit, is not expected to appear at Monday'smeeting, said church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage.   In response to reporters' shouted questions as he drove from theservice, Swaggart said he wasn't planning to leave the ministry,adding, ``Why should I?''   The Assemblies' Louisiana Presbytery recommended a two-yearrehabilitation and a three-month suspension from the pulpit forSwaggart. Mrs. Turnage has said that all other Assemblies ministerswho have confessed to moral failure were barred from preaching forat least a year.   The Executive Presbytery discussed the matter for 11 hours Feb.25 and 26 before asking Louisiana officials to reconsider. TheExecutive Presbytery, headed by General Superintendent G. RaymondCarlson, apparently wanted tougher penalties for Swaggart.   But after gathering again Feb. 29 for what was described as anemotional nine-hour session, the Louisiana Presbytery stood by itsoriginal decision.   The Louisiana Presbytery has close ties to Swaggart _ forinstance, state superintendent Cecil Janway also sits on the boardof Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries.   Reports were circulating that Swaggart would leave thedenomination if church officials suspended him for longer thanthree months, but a spokesman for Swaggart's ministry said thepreacher has made no decision on how he might react. Mrs. Turnagesaid she did not believe the General Presbytery would be swayed by``rumors heard through the media.''   Mrs. Turnage said the church's national officials have the finalsay, but until now have always been able to work out an agreementwith state leaders.   The General Presbytery, whose members include representativesfrom each of the church's state councils, is a court of last resorton ministerial credentials. Generally, a minister would appeal hiscase to the group after his course of rehabilitation had beendecided by the Executive Presbytery. The Executive Presbyteryshort-circuited that process when it decided March 3 to turn theSwaggart case over to the larger body.   The two-day meeting at the denomination's headquarters is toopen at 2 p.m. Monday. The group will debate according toparliamentary rules of order and a majority vote will decideSwaggart's fate, Mrs. Turnage said. She expected a decision to bemade late Tuesday afternoon.   Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries, with television broadcasts thatreach several foreign countries, took in an estimated $150 millionin 1986. The group contributes $12 million a year to the foreignmissions program of the national church.   Donations have fallen off since Swaggart's confession, forcinghis ministry to lay off about 100 workers and suspend constructionat the Jimmy Swaggart Bible College.   But Swaggart, who addressed his congregation last week, seemsundaunted and apparently is counting on the General Presbytery tofollow the Louisiana district's recommendation of a three-monthsuspension.   Swaggart told his congregation Wednesday that he was going outof his mind but ``when I'm back in the pulpit on May 22, I'll beback in my mind.''   May 22 would be three months from the start of Swaggart'svoluntary abstention from preaching.   On Sunday, Swaggart introduced a speaker and led some hymns.Later, as he drove away with his wife and son, he said in responseto a reporter's question that there was no reason for him to leavethe Assemblies of God.   But he declined to answer further questions, responding to amale reporter who asked him to ``come over here and talk to us'' byshouting back, ``You're not pretty enough!''</TEXT></DOC>
