Jay ``Stoney'' Harrison, 25, was charged with killing thedetectives and was arraigned Tuesday evening. He later pleadedinnocent and was returned to Rikers Island jail without bail.   Harrison maintained that the officers were shot during a robberyby a gunman who freed him, said Assistant District Attorney BobAlexander.   Harrison was arrested late Monday at his girlfriend's home inthe New York City borough of Brooklyn after a 10-hour citywide hunt.   He had been brought to a district attorney's office Monday totake a lie detector test and discuss a plea bargain, but a seriesof police mistakes allowed him to find a loaded gun in a policelocker with a defective lock, authorities said.   The errors began when Harrison was left alone in a detectives'squad room, authorities said. Prisoners kept in the room areusually handcuffed to a pipe out of reach of the lockers, butHarrison was left cuffed by just one hand to let him eat lunch,police said.   The suspect either wasn't searched or poorly searched before hisreturn to jail, and he was alone in the back seat of the car, aviolation of police policy, authorities said.   Asked if the errors had killed the two decorated officers,Condon replied, ``Yes.'' He announced a policy change that bansinterrogating or holding prisoners in rooms with lockers.   Killed were Detectives Keith L. Williams, 34, of New York City,and Richard J. Guerzon, 46, of Merrick. Authorities said Harrisonfired at least five shots from the stolen gun. Both officers weredead at the scene.   Harrison was arraigned on four counts of second-degree murder:one each for killing the detectives and two of felony murder, ormurder in the furtherance of a crime _ escape, said John Hayes,Queens Criminal Court clerk. Harrison also was arraigned on thecharges of first-degree escape and second-degree criminal weaponpossession, Hayes said.   The maximum penalty for murder in New York is 25 years to life.   The Detectives Endowment Association said it would set up a fundfor their families. Guerzon, a 20-year veteran, was married, withfour children; Williams, an eight-year veteran, was married and hada daughter.   Gary Schoer, a lawyer temporarily representing Harrison, askedthe judge to appoint a public defender.   Schoer's law partner, Michael Sileo, is Harrison's lawyer inother criminal cases but said he had decided not to represent himin the detective killings, for reasons he would not discuss.   Harrison's record dates from 1980. In October, he and his motherwere arrested on charges of conspiring to kill a witness againsthim in the July slaying of Harrison's girlfriend.</TEXT></DOC>
