<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0393 </DOCNO><TEXT>The author presents his arguments against the use of nuclear energy fromthe health hazard point of view, describing the damaging effects of radioactiveradiation as a result of increasing environmental radioactivity due tothe operation of nuclear installations, or as a consequence of nuclearaccidents. The economic problems resulting from an immediate decommissioningof nuclear power plants - development of electricity demand and costs- are judged to be solvable, and decommissioning, the author says, wouldcreate new jobs. Another immediate response to the latest irregularitiesdisclosed in the nuclear waste management industry should be to establishpublic supervisory bodies consisting of non-biased experts who can befound in ecologic research institutes or in other independent monitoringand measuring institutions.
