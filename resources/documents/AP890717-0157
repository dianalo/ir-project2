The device is called CAVCTS, for combined acceleration vibrationclimatic test system.   Boucher said he was not aware of any protest from the Indiangovernment against the U.S. denial of an export license for thedevice.   But the Indian Embassy said later the refusal was unjustifiedsince India had already received a U.S. license to purchase theequipment in 1985, and the device was usable only for testingshort-range missile launchers.   An Embassy statement said the denial was based on ``allegedconcern arising out of the Missile Technology Control Regime'' thatthe United States concluded in 1987. The agreement with France,Britain, the Soviet Union, Japan and several other countries, aimedto curb proliferation of missile technology in the Third World.   However, the Embassy said, ``this piece of equipment is onlyrelevant for short-range launchers and does not attract MTCRconcern.''   The Embassy did not explain the delay in buying the $1.2 milliondevice, which allowed the original license to expire.   India has successfully tested its ``Agni'' surface-to-surfaceballistic missile, which Western experts speculated could carry anuclear warhead. But the Indian government continues to renouncenuclear arms.</TEXT></DOC>
