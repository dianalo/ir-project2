But after giving programs all the expandedandM;memory they can use, you may still have enough left for a RAM drive thatandM;will further improve their performance.andM;it won't cost you a lot to put in a RAM drive.andP;  One megabyte of expandedandM;memory with a board costs about $250 to $400.andP;  The boards usuallyandM;hold up to 3MB, and you can add another 1MB for less than $100.andM;VDISK.SYS and RAMDRIVE.SYS aren't the only device drivers that youandM;can use to create a RAM drive.andP;  A similar driver is provided with almostandM;any memory board you buy; the variations among drivers are minor, but aandM;driver that can use expanded or extended memory is better.andM;Hardware SpeedupsandM;Getting more out of your software with faster hardwareandM;needn't be a break-the-bank solution.andM;Faster hardware means faster software performance.andP;  Here are some waysandM;you can improve your hardware setup to get the most out of your programs.andM;THE RIGHT HARD DRIVEandM;A slow hard drive is a drag on a fast processor.andP;  Match the two for betterandM;performance.andP;  For an 8088 machine, a good choice is a drive such as theandM;Seagate ST225, rated at a 65-millisecond access time.andP;  For 286 computers,andM;get a drive in the range of the 39ms Seagate ST251 or 28ms SeagateandM;ST251-1.andP;  A 386 PC requires a drive such as the 14ms Micropolis MK1664.andM;A caching controller board such as the CompuAdd HardCache/ESDI improvesandM;the performance of any drive.andP;  improvements are most significant for databaseandM;and desktop publishing programs.andM;HARD DISK TUNE-UPandM;Fix drives that are fragmented-Wes of files are scattered all over theandM;disk surface-with a defragmenter program such as those included with TheandM;Norton Utilities and PC Tools (10 to 20 percent improvement).andM;Fix the interweave-the efficiency of the match between the disk's spinandM;rate and how soon the controller can write data to the drive-with a programandM;such as SpinRite II (50 to 400 percent improvement).andP;  Use a diskandM;caching program such as PC.Kwik's Power Pak to avoid frequent disk accessesandM;(up to 100 percent improvement).andM;MATH COPROCESSORSandM;By handling math calculations, a math coprocessor takes some of the burdenandM;off the main processor and gets results back to the program faster.andM;Software must be written with a math coprocessor in mind for it to do anyandM;good, but many math-intensive programs--such as spreadsheets, CAD software,andM;statistical packages, and compilers-use the add-on chip.andP;  Costs rangeandM;from $99 for a coprocessor matched to an 8088 CPU to $700 for one toandM;work with a 33MHz 80386 processor (200 to 300 percent improvementandM;for big applications.)andM;ACCELERATOR BOARDSandM;You can turn an 8088 or 8086 machine into a 12MHz 80286 (a 200 toandM;400 percent improvement) for about $395 with the SOTA 286i add-inandM;board that replaces the old processor.andP;  For about $600 intel's inboard 386andM;can turn an XT into a 80386 (a 700 percent improvement), and for $1,000andM;intel's inboard 386 for the AT can convert a 286 into a 386 (300 percentandM;faster).andP;  But you'll still have slower, mismatched hard drives and the lessandM;efficient 8-bit or 164At expansion slots.andM;REPLACE THE MOTHERBOARDandM;A full motherboard swap gives you the power of a faster processor and theandM;advantages of wider expansion slots.andP;  You'll need about $300 for an 80286andM;motherboard, $500 to $1,500 for a 386 board, and some knowledge aboutandM;how a computer's components are wired together for either replacement.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
