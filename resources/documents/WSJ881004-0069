The rumor mill is busier today than ever. For one thing, computer networks give middle- and lower-level managers access to a plethora of information, while the era of corporate restructurings and takeovers &quot;has made people increasingly nervous -- and more receptive to believing and starting rumors,&quot; says Arnold Brown, a New York consultant.    Another factor that has heated up the rumor mill: the move of many corporate headquarters from urban to suburban and rural locations. Employees in isolated settings talk less to outsiders and more to each other.    Rather than ignore or try to repress the grapevine, it's crucial for executives to tune into it, consultants say. That can help managers uncover attitudes, problems and ideas. Moreover, suggests Mr. Brown, executives should &quot;identify the key people in your company's grapevine and, instead of punishing them, feed them information.&quot; He adds: &quot;When a company issues a press release it knows what newspapers to contact, so why not know your internal media?&quot;    To Be or Not To Be   A Better Manager   EAGER TO become a better manager? Try studying Shakespeare or Melville.    &quot;You don't go to literature for solutions to specific management problems,&quot; says Anthony Terracciano, president of Mellon Bank Corp. &quot;But if you read, it enriches your context and helps you frame better questions. He says works of Dostoevski, Plato and Machiavelli, for example, have provided &quot;important analogies&quot; to help illuminate management issues.    Now, a team of University of Louisville professors of humanities are running seminars to help local executives look for answers to management problems in such works as &quot;King Lear,&quot; &quot;Othello,&quot; &quot;Antigone&quot; and &quot;Billy Budd.&quot; &quot;They provide insights into everyday frustrations and quandaries, from the whole question of transfer of power to jealousies among employees,&quot; says Bob Schulman, who launched the Great Stories seminars.    Reading &quot;King Lear&quot; sparked a heated debate among one seminar group over the best way to turn over corporate power. The consensus: Don't give up even the trappings of power unless you're willing to leave the organization.    Another group reading Melville's &quot;Billy Budd&quot; -- the story of a sailor executed for killing a jealous shipmate -- concluded that corporate America has plenty of modern-day Billys.    The group saw Budd as a valuable employee fired by a manager who &quot;went by the book instead of following his intuition,&quot; says Mr. Schulman.    Ethics Violators   Often in Midlife   MIDDLE MANAGERS who are 40 to 45 years old are most likely to fall into unethical practices on the job, a recent survey of some 100 personnel executives concludes.    Why? One Houston-based executive told the surveyers that midlife managers feel &quot;the desire to 'make it' before it's too late.&quot;    The survey by Personnel Journal found that 26% of respondents designated managers between 40 and 45 as most prone to ethics violations; 23% cited the 35 to 40-year-old age group. Middle managers were cited by 51%, senior-level managers, 29%, and top managers, 13%.    But companies &quot;will make a terrible mistake if they just look for unethical behavior among middle-age middle managers,&quot; says E. John Keller, director of asset protection at Zale Corp., Dallas. &quot;Senior managers set the tone for the corporation and have the most opportunities to execute major frauds. The 40-to-45-year-olds will violate ethics if they see senior executives not following high standards.&quot;    Hire an Executive,   Get a Secretary, Too   WHEN executives move from one company to another, their secretaries are increasingly accompanying them to the new jobs.    &quot;Often the newly named executive is replacing someone who is ousted, and he faces a number of unpopular decisions,&quot; says Victor H. Loewenstein, managing partner of Egon Zehnder International Inc., a New York executive-consulting firm. &quot;He needs someone he can trust to prepare sensitive memos&quot; outlining controversial firings and other changes.    Executives rarely negotiate the transfer of a secretary as part of an employment contract. Rather, it's an informally accepted perk that few new employers question. But there are exceptions. A New York banking executive recruited recently to a Midwestern bank was turned down when he asked to take along his secretary at an annual salary of $60,000 -- double the average secretarial salary at that bank. That might have triggered a revolt among other executive secretaries at the bank. </TEXT></DOC>
