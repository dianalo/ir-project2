Based upon areview of these research findings, legal mandates, local laws and regulations,and after extensive public review and comment the NPS developed an ORVManagement Plan which eventually became effective on April 15, 1981.For the convenience of the reader, the most significant provisions of the1981 ORV Management Plan are outlined below: See figure (1).<ITAG tagnum="84">1981 ORV Management Plan</ITAG>1. Head of the Meadow Beach in Truro to Coast Guard Beach in Eastham, adistance of 16 miles, was open to ORV traffic year-round except for protectedbeaches which were closed to ORV traffic from June 15 through September15.2. The 1.5 mile stretch of beach from Head of the Meadow Beach north toHigh Head was open to ORV traffic year-round.3. High Head to the opening of Hatches, Harbor, a distance of 8 miles,was open to ORV traffic year-round except for the Race Point protectedbeach which was closed from June 15 through September 15.4. The emergency dune route between Race Point Ranger Station and HighHead was open to ORV traffic ONLY when tern nesting closures or high tidesprevented continuous travel on the beach.5. North of Head of the Meadow Beach, ORV traffic was restricted to a corridordefined as extending lateally from the berm crest to the spring high tidedrift line; south of Head of the Meadow Beach, ORV traffic was confinedto a corridor defined as extending laterally from the berm crest to thebase of the bluffs or the toe of the dunes.On April 15, 1981, the Conservation Law Foundation of New England (CLF)and other organizations filed suit against the Department of the Interior(Department) and the NPS to terminate all ORV use at the Seashore. On May25, 1984, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruledthat the 1981 ORV Management Plan had appropriately established zones forORV use in accordance with the University of Massachusetts study so asnot to ``adversely affect'' the Seashore's ecology. The Court then remandedissues of appropriateness of ORV use, fair allocation of space, and visitorconflict to the agency for further consideration. On August 1, 1985, theDepartment promulgated a rulemaking (50 FR 31177) that implemented an amendedORV Management Plan. This amended plan and its regulations, which wentinto effect on September 3, 1985, were developed by the NPS and were basedon a number of factors and considerations, including: legislative mandates,existing local laws and regulations, the results of a 1985 beach user surveyconducted by the City University of New York, over 4 years of experienceunder the provisions of the 1981 ORV Management Plan, geographical considerations,visitor use statistics, scenic and aesthetic impacts, and management feasibility.Since then, the NPS has managed ORV use at the Seashore under the provisionsof the 1985 ORV Management Plan and regulations codified at 36 CFR 7.67(a).For the convenience of the reader, the most significant provisions of the1985 ORV Management Plan, which is the existing plan, are outlined below:See figure (2).<ITAG tagnum="84">1985 ORV Management Plan (existing plan)</ITAG>1. Head of the Meadow Beach in Truro to Coast Guard Beach in Eastham isclosed to ORV traffic year-round.2. The 1.5 mile stretch of beach from Head of the Meadow Beach north toHigh Head is closed to ORV traffic year-round.3. High Head to the opening of Hatches Harbor is open to ORV traffic fromApril 15 through November 15 except when tides, beach configuration, ornesting birds make the route impassable.4. The emergency dune route is closed to ORV traffic.5. A limited access ORV pass is available during the period from November16 through April 14 for beach access between High Head and Hatches Harborunder certain conditions.6. ORV traffic is confined to a corridor extending laterally from a point10 feet seaward of the spring high tide drift line to the berm crest.The 1985 ORV Management Plan closed 17.5 miles of beach from High Headin Truro to Coast Guard Beach in Eastham. This area had been open to ORVtraffic during all but the summer months under the 1981 plan. The Servicemaintains that this area had limited ORV use prior to 1985, and the closureunder the current management plan recognized the need to avoid unnecessaryuser conflicts. In this section, there are 12 Seashore and town beachesand parking areas which provide pedestrian access to fishing and otheruses throughout the year.The section of beach which is open to ORV use from Hatches Harbor aroundRace Point to High Head, a distance of 8 miles, provides beach access toprime fishing grounds and, due to limited access points, minimizes pedestrianand other user conflicts. Certain special uses (winter access to shellfishingbeds, maintenance of dune cottages, etc.) are accommodated through theuse of Limited Access Passes. Dune cottage residents have access to theirindividual cottages at any time that the route is passable.Vehicle operators, other than cottage owners, who use the designated ORVroutes must obtain an annual ORV permit. (2394 ORV permits were issuedin 1987. 2529 ORV permits were issued between January 1 and October 31,1988, which represents the latest figures for 1988 at the time of thisnotice.) The actual number of vehicles on the beach on a given day varieswith season, weather, fishing conditions, and other factors. A daily maximumof approximately 250 off-road vehicles used Seashore beaches during thebusiest days in 1988.Total annual visitation to Cape Cod National Seashore during the 1988 calendaryear is estimated to be 5.2 million visitors.In March 1986, in response to controversy over the use of ORV's at theSeashore, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Fish and Wildlifeand Parks assembled a study team to review the ORV issue. The study team'sreport recommended several changes to the 1985 ORV Management Plan includingre-opening the beach year-round from Hatches Harbor to Coast Guard Beachin Eastham.  On June 28, 1988, the U.S. District Court issued its decision concerningthe 1985 ORV Management Plan and its implementing regulations. The Courtheld among other things that, under the provisions of the 1985 ORV ManagementPlan and regulations:  1. ORV use at the Seashore is not inappropriate;  2. User conflicts within the ORV zone are minimized and that the Governmenthas properly exercised its discretion in accommodating a variety of recreationaluses within the ORV corridor with minimum conflict;  3. The Government has properly accorded other recreational users adequateuse of the Seashore;  4. The Government properly surveyed the sentiments of Seashore users; and 5. ORV use does not adversely affect the Seashore's values as managed. The Court also reaffirmed its 1984 decision that the Seashore's ecologywas adequately protected from the impacts of ORV use under the 1981 Plan. As a result of a review of the administrative record supporting the 1981and 1985 ORV Management Plans and new information, including the finaldecision of the district court, the report of the 1986 Study Team, andthe 1986 and 1988 recommendations of the Cape Cod Advisory Commission,the NPS proposes to modify the 1985 ORV Management Plan as follows:  The 6.75 mile section of beach from High Head in Truro south to BallstonBeach in Truro will be open, during night-time hours only, to ORV trafficduring the period from April 15 through May 31 and from September 15 throughNovember 15.  This section of beach is closed year-round under the existing 1985 ORVManagement Plan. This revision will provide additional ORV use and accessfor fishing. Restricting the ORV use to night-time hours and to the Springand Fall calendar periods will help minimize pedestrian and other userconflicts. The 6.75 miles includes one protected Seashore beach and threetown beaches. Much of the beach in this area is bounded by high bluffsand large dunes.  Generally, a greater degree of caution and awareness of tide informationwill be needed by ORV users on the High Head to Ballston section of beach. The Seashore will modify its ORV permit orientation program to emphasizethe hazards associated with the tides and beach configuration on this 6.75mile section. Ranger patrols will be utilized to monitor and enforce theroute designations, time and travel restrictions, and to assist in preventingviolations of the ORV regulations. Patrols will also be scheduled duringthe summer months to monitor the beach conditions, assist visitors, andenforce the June 1 through September 14 closure. Existing regulations willbe utilized to close the beach to ORV traffic whenever tides, nesting birds,or the beach configuration prevents travel in the designated corridor. For the convenience of the reader, the most significant provisions of theproposed revision to the 1985 ORV Management Plan are outlined below: Seefigure (3).  <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Revision to ORV Management Plan  </ITAG>1. Ballston Beach in Truro to Coast Guard Beach in Eastham, a 10.75 milesection of beach, is closed to ORV traffic year-round.  2. Ballston Beach in Truro to High Head in Truro, a 6.75 mile section ofbeach, is open, during night-time hours only, to ORV traffic from April15 through May 31 and from September 15 through November 15, except whentides, beach configuration, or nesting birds make the route impassable. 3. High Head to the opening of Hatches Harbor is open to ORV traffic fromApril 15 through November 15 except when tides, beach configuration, ornesting birds make the route impassable.  4. The emergency dune route is closed to ORV traffic.  5. A limited access ORV pass is available during the period from November16 through April 14 for beach access between High Head and Hatches Harborunder certain conditions.  6. ORV traffic is confined to a corridor extending from a point 10 feetseaward of the Spring high tide drift line to the berm crest, except inareas where a drift line is not distinguishable due to cliffs or existingdunes, in which case travel will be restricted to the beach below the cliffsor toe of the dune.  Restrictions imposed under the Seashore's ORV Management Plan are applicableonly on lands administered, by the NPS; ORV access to privately owned landis subject to permission of the landowner. In addition, because the UnitedStates exercises concurrent legislative jurisdiction with the Commonwealthof Massachusetts over lands and water within the Seashore boundary, ORVrestrictions imposed by State and local governments also apply to landadministered by the NPS. For instance, on October 18, 1988, the town ofWellfleet enacted a by-law that prohibits vehicle travel below the hightide line year-round on beaches within that town. This restriction nowapplies to approximately 8 miles of beaches administered by the NPS. (Thisby-law does not conflict with the existing rules or proposed revisions).The effects of this by-law and other local government restrictions shouldbe considered by persons submitting suggestions in response to this notice,but should also be considered as being beyond the control of the Departmentor the NPS to change.      <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation</ITAG>The National Park Service (NPS) welcomes and encourages comment on themanagement of ORV's at Cape Cod National Seashore. Two basic issues areinvolved: Regulation to protect the resources and regulation to minimizeconflicts between visitors and ORV users.The Court found that the Plan and Amended Plan, as implemented and enforced,effectively protect the ecology of the Seashore from the impact of ORVs.The 1985 ORV Plan emphasized the minimization or ORV/non-ORV user conflict.The visitor conflict study revealed that under the 1981 ORV Plan ``* ** * ORV uses wer extremely unlikely to be mentioned as a reason why visitors'enjoyment of the Seashore may have decreased,'' and that 86 percent ofthe non-ORV using visitors did not believe additional ORV restrictionsbeyond those incorporated in the 1981 plan were needed.Because the scope and nature of any regulatory scheme reflects a ``balancing''of diverse visitor uses and expectations, we are encouraging comments thatfocus on whether this proposal would increase user conflicts in a mannerthat would be inconsistent with the use and enjoyment of the Cape CodeNational Seashore.In addition we would like to comment on specific aspects of this proposal.Should the amount of beach proposed to be reopened to ORV's be enlargedor reduced? How should any changes be made? Should the restriction on useto night-time hours only be relaxed or made more stringent? How shouldany changes be made? Should proposed periods of reopening be expanded orcontracted? How should any changes be made?<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information.</ITAG>The following individual wrote this regulation: Tony Bonanno, Chief Ranger,Cape Cod National Seashore, South Wellfleet, MA 02663.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The information collection requirements contained in andSection; 7.67(a)(4)have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et. seq.</T3> and assigned clearance number 1024-0026.
