Ms. Harjo, 44, a Cheyenne and Creek who was born in El Reno,Okla., is president of the Morning Star Foundation, an organizationadvocating respect for the cultural rights of Indians.   She was named Monday as one of the 12 Indians required byCongress to be included in the 25-member board of directors of theNational Museum of the American Indian.   The museum was authorized last year as the last Smithsonianmuseum to be built on the National Mall. It will be squeezedbetween the Air and Space Museum and the Capitol. A companionmuseum also will be built in New York City's Custom House.   When completed in 1992, the museum will consolidate theSmithsonian's big Indian collection with 1 million artifacts,40,000 books and 86,000 photos in New York City's Museum of theAmerican Indian, which was short of space and running low on money.The New York collection is possibly the world's largest.   In an interview, Ms. Harjo said the museum will acquaint whiteAmericans with a fresh view of history ``if I have anything to dowith it.''   And that view may be shocking in a capital where even the nameof the professional football team _ the Washington Redskins _ is asinsulting to native Americans as other epithets would be to othergroups, she said.   If the museum succeeds, even such a simple schoolday lesson as``Columbus discovered America'' will have to be freshly thoughtthrough, Ms. Harjo said.   With a laugh, she suggested that ``America discovered Columbus''or ``Indians had a lax immigration policy,'' would be a moreaccurate way to describe what happened in 1492.   Her point was that the continent called America was here _ andpopulated by developed civilizations _ long before Columbus'``discovery'' 500 years ago.   ``They came, we welcomed, they killed _ short history for thequincentennial,'' she said.   Ms. Harjo's grievance with the way American Indians' history ispresented is that it treats them as relics. ``We are not discussedin the present tense, therefore we have no future,'' she said.   ``The fact is that history has never been written accuratelyabout native peoples,'' she said. ``It is written by the colonizerand is designed to justify the land grabs and continuedcolonization, the subjugation of a people.''   As the result, when the Indian won a battle it was a``massacre''; when white troops won it was a ``victory.''   ``Telling the truth doesn't mean presenting Indians always inthe most positive light,'' Ms. Harjo said. ``It just means tellingthe truth. ... We need an educational program to humanize us in away that will counter the dehumanizing, stereotyping and cartooningthat has taken place.''</TEXT></DOC>
