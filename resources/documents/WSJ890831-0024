Lawrence Ryckman, the Calgary, Alberta-based technology concern's president and chief executive officer, said the pact would be the first licensing agreement for the QSound technology and would provide the company with its first operating revenue. A spokeswoman for Nintendo's U.S. subsidiary, Nintendo of America Inc. confirmed that a conditional agreement had been reached.    Archer said that under the agreement Nintendo would pay a royalty on hardware and software using the QSound technology and make an initial advance royalty payment. It said Nintendo also would get an option to acquire Archer common shares. It said the non-exclusive license, which permits Archer to license other users, would last five years. </TEXT></DOC>
