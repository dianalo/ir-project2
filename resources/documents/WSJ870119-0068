There's no fun quite like a $250 billion New Year's party, America's stock-market investors are finding, even if it is hard to figure out who's picking up the tab.    Stock-market indexes already have soared about 10% this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has yet to post a losing day, and money is pouring into the more than $2.75 trillion U.S. equity market from Americans and foreigners, individuals and institutions.    Yet, the market madness is as puzzling as it is exhilarating. The 4 1/2-year-old bull market has charged ahead despite a slew of bearish problems, including weak or inconsistent corporate earnings, tepid economic growth, mind-boggling budget and trade deficits and, lately, rebounding energy prices and a plummeting dollar.    And many stock-market observers bring up more-immediate questions: When and how will the rally end?    Superbulls, such as market seer Robert Prechter, say the current surge initiates a monster rally that won't end until the industrial average reaches 3600. Others, such as Gruntal andamp; Co. market analyst Gene Jay Seagle, expect it to hit 2500 &quot;by the end of this year, then fall back 6% to 8%.&quot;    A dwindling number of bears, in contrast, see various unpleasant possibilities, ranging from a brief, sharp correction any day now to a 1973-74-style bear market to a world-wide stock-market collapse reminiscent of the 1930s.    One of those predicting the worst is James Rogers, a highly respected stock picker. Disturbed over what he sees as speculative excesses, he told Barron's magazine barely over a month ago that he expects the dollar to go into a free fall, routing bond markets and triggering a global collapse in stocks.    However, a more typical view is expressed by Steven Leuthold, who heads a Minneapolis-based financial-advisory concern. &quot;You have to realize we're in Looney Tunes land, and you should stay fairly close to the exits,&quot; he says. But he adds, &quot;It's a lot of fun, and you could make a lot of money here.&quot;    Many market professionals had thought that the runaway January rally would at least pause for a spate of profit-taking last Thursday. Instead, the industrial average shot up another 35 points in the busiest trading day in New York Stock Exchange history. And even though a bit of profit-taking did occur Friday, the Dow industrials and some other major market measures managed to advance again anyway.    Professional money managers' drive to find issues not already bid up to lofty levels, coupled with resumed buying by last month's tax sellers, are giving stocks of smaller companies the biggest ride of all. For example, the Nasdaq index of over-the-counter industrial stocks has soared nearly half again as much as the Dow industrials so far this year. &quot;If you could have seen the pandemonium in our OTC trading room {last week}, you would have seen where {individual investors} were putting their money,&quot; says Frank Korth, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Recent research and Wall Street Journal interviews with market professionals, money managers and economists late last week suggest that the current rally has resulted from the confluence of both ordinary and extraordinary factors.    The extraordinary factors include the start of what's likely to be the last huge season for investments in individual retirement accounts, in view of tax-law changes that, beginning this tax year, reduced or ended their deductibility for many taxpayers. In addition, the market has been aided by pent-up demand for stocks from individuals seeking to reinvest the proceeds of their tax-motivated selling during last year's fourth quarter and from some institutions that had retreated from the market to stay clear of such selling.    Meanwhile, a growing horde of individuals and institutions, in line with their normal investment tactics, are forsaking low-yielding bond and money-fund investments for what they hope will be highflying stocks. With slick marketing, mutual-fund and other money managers have made it easy for individuals to hop from bond or money-market funds into equities with a simple phone call -- just like the pros do.    And people have been doing that with a vengeance. At T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, the Prime Reserve money-market fund shrank some $150 million, to about $2.65 billion, between Dec. 31 and last Thursday. Meanwhile, a Price growth-stock fund, for instance, passed $1.5 billion in assets Thursday, up from $1.28 billion at year-end -- partly because of capital appreciation due to higher stock prices.    At Boston-based Fidelity Investments, the flagship Magellan Fund sailed past $8.4 billion in assets by the end of the week, up $1 billion since year-end, a spokesman says. And the Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa., says that so far this month, &quot;we probably sold more equity funds than during all of December.&quot;    Brokers say foreign, especially Japanese, investors have been voracious buyers of stocks here during the past two weeks. Faced with a rising yen and prospects for slower economic growth, Japanese investors are increasingly reluctant to buy Japanese stocks, which typically sell on the Tokyo market at prices as high as 50 times annual earnings, when they can buy American blue chips on the Big Board at only a third of that ratio, brokers here say.    Even before the current rally, foreign investors had vastly stepped up their stock purchases here. According to Securities Industry Association figures for the first nine months of last year, such purchases topped $18 billion -- triple the previous full-year record set in 1981.    Among the biggest stock buyers lately have been state and local pension plans. Nationwide, these funds control $540 billion in assets, with most of the money traditionally going into bonds. But &quot;there's been an enormous interest in equities the past few years,&quot; says Sandy Lincoln, a pension consultant at A.S. Hansen Inc. &quot;Public pension plans are trying to get more bang for their bucks.&quot;    Louisiana's Teachers Retirement System, for example, recently allotted $600 million for the stock market. &quot;About half that amount is invested now, and it has all been going in since Jan. 1,&quot; says Jennifer Nettercille, an investment manager at the fund. Other public pension plans also are streaming into the stock market. The $2.3 billion Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension System has 59% of its assets in stocks but wants to increase that to 65%. Similarly, state plans in Iowa, Massachusetts and California are looking to increase their stock-market investments, says Larry Davanzo, a pension consultant at Wilshire Associates Inc.    Moreover, all this buying is occurring while the supply of stocks is shriveling. Mergers, leveraged buyouts and corporate stock-repurchase programs have taken about $200 billion of stocks out of circulation in the past two years, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. estimates.    To Wright Investors Service, a Bridgeport, Conn., advisory and money-management concern, the current market looks a lot like the one immediately prior to the 1973-74 bear market. The firm predicts a market correction this year and has stashed 25% to 30% of the money it manages in short-term government securities.    However, Leon Cooperman, co-chairman of the Goldman Sachs investment policy committee, says he doesn't yet see the kind of excesses or other signs that he normally associates with a market top. These include: an economy on the verge of recession; a tighter monetary policy leading to higher interest rates; a significant rise in inflation; stocks becoming overvalued relative to bonds, and a big increase in new issues producing a net increase in stock supplies.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to its 10th consecutive record close Friday, despite profit-takers' arrival in force.    Declining issues had nearly a 2-to-1 lead over advancers on the New York Stock Exchange. But traders said computer-assisted buying programs tied to stock-index futures helped the major market indexes end higher on the day.    The industrial average finished up 5.90 points at 2076.63. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index and the New York Stock Exchange composite index edged higher, also to record levels.    The profit-taking was evident in many technology stocks that spearheaded the market's advance all last week. However, others climbed still higher Friday, led by Digital Equipment, which added another 4 1/8 to 137. That brought its gain for the week to 23 1/4.    First City Bancorp gained 1 1/2 to 6 5/8 on 573,800 shares, making it the day's biggest percentage gainer on the Big Board. According to market rumors last week, a foreign bank might be interested in acquiring the Houston-based bank or in providing a capital infusion. A spokesman said the bank couldn't explain the stock activity.    Interest in airline stocks remained strong as many carriers raised their fares. Pan Am moved up 1/2 to 6 on more than 11.2 million shares on continued speculation that AMR may be thinking of acquiring the company.    ---                   New Year's Buying Spree                            DEC. 31      JAN. 16                               1986         1987     PERCENT INDEX                        CLOSE        CLOSE        GAIN Dow Jones Industrials      1895.95      2076.63       9.53% Sandamp;P 500                     242.17       266.28       9.96 Value-Line                  225.62       247.51       9.70 NYSE Composite              138.58       152.21       9.84 Amex                        263.27       290.76      10.44 Nasdaq Composite            348.83       389.87      11.77 Nasdaq Industrials          349.33       397.27      13.72</TEXT></DOC>
