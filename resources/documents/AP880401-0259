The House Government Operations Committee also called on OSHA toestablish minimum training standards for packinghouse workers andconsider setting standards on work loads and chain speeds inpackinghouses.   The committee concluded in a 45-page report that tens ofthousands of meatpacking workers are being injured each yearbecause they are ``regarded by some as disposable, someone who isused and then discarded.''   Citing Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel ``The Jungle'' on labor toilin Chicago packinghouses, the committee said ``more than 80 yearslater ... meatpacking employees still work'' under the sameconditions of slick floors and dangerous chain speeds that causethem to accidentally slash themselves and one another.   Terry Mikelson, an OSHA spokesman, said the agency will take thecommittee's recommendations ``under consideration.''   ``We already devote special resources to meatpacking,'' he said,explaining that packinghouses are inspected three times more oftenthan plants in other manufacturing industries. ``Everybodyrecognizes that its a high-hazard industry and that employers needto do a better job.''   The report was based on three days of hearings conducted lastyear by the House panel's employment and housing subcommitteefocusing on OSHA and IBP Inc.'s flagship packinghouse at DakotaCity, Neb.   At the time of the first hearing, IBP and the United Food andCommercial Workers Union were engaged in a bitter lockout thatturned into a strike involving 2,900 workers.   The strike has since been settled, but not before the unionsucceeded in focusing both congressional and OSHA attention onsafety conditions in the plant and the industry.   Last July, OSHA fined IBP $2.6 million _ then the biggestpenalty ever levied by the agency _ for safety and recordviolations at the Dakota City plant. The company has appealed thefine.   Part of the fine resulted from OSHA's determination that thecompany kept two sets of injury records at the plant, one forinternal use and the other for the purview of OSHA inspectors whenthey visited.   In testifying before the subcommittee, IBP Chairman RobertPeterson denied that two sets of books were kept. Later, Petersonrecanted that testimony, saying it was based on misunderstandingswithin the company.   The committee concluded last week that Peterson's explanation``strained credibility'' but added that the panel lacked sufficientevidence to seek a perjury indictment of him.   OSHA, meanwhile, announced last week that it would quit relyingonly on company-maintained injury records in deciding whether aplant should be inspected further.   Beginning this past Monday, the agency's inspectors are to``walk through'' the high-hazard areas of each plant afterreviewing their safety logs.   The committee, like officials in some other government agencies,concluded that exempting companies from inspections based onemployer-maintained records encouraged companies to under-reportinjuries and illnesses.</TEXT></DOC>
