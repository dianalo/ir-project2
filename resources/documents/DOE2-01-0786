The complexity of these systems makesthem difficult to study by proton magnetic resonance (pmr), one of themore powerful techniques for studying solution structure and dynamics.If one of the components of the complex could be per-deuterated, thesesystems would be more amenable to study by pmr. Fully deuterated plantmicroorganisms (cyanobacteria, bacteria, yeast and molds) have been availablefor some years. Higher plants and animals do not withstand high levelsof D{sub 2}O. Thus, limited amounts only of plant proteins have beenavailable, which restricted the application of perdeuterated proteinsto interesting systems. But with the advent of genetic engineering usingrecombinant DNA techniques, mammalian, higher plant and other proteinsare available in quantity in perdeuterated form. Several advantages accruefrom using engineered bacteria. Yields of a particular product are high,which minimizes the need for large quantities of perdeuterated nutrientmedium. Chemical and genetic manipulation of the product is easily done.They present here pmr results obtained with calmodulin, the first perdeuteratedmammial protein, and with other systems.</TEXT></DOC>
