The announcement by Cicippio's captors lowered tensions at theWhite House and elsewhere. But it appeared unlikely to lead to animmediate recall of U.S. naval power converging on the easternMediterranean, a precaution taken in the event Cicippio were killedand President Bush ordered a military strike.   ``I urge everyone to keep in mind, especially in regard to theships, that we still have a serious problem in the Middle East,''said Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. Hostages are still beingheld, he said, adding that he did not expect ``any quick changes''in the military deployment.   Earlier, Fitzwater said Bush had made preliminary decisions ``ofevery kind'' about how the United States would respond ifterrorists killed Cicippio, following the reported Monday executionof Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.   Thursday was the threatened execution date of Cicippio by theRevolutionary Justice Organization. However, 45 minutes before thedeadline, the radical group said it would spare his lifetemporarily.   The captors indicated Cicippio still could be killed ``withindays'' unless Israel met new, tougher terms, including release ofunspecified Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas. Originally, theyhad demanded only the release of a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnappedby Israel, Abdul Karim Obeid.   Fitzwater, asked whether the United States was consideringseeking extradition of Obeid from Israel for trial in connectionwith possible involvement in the kidnapping of Higgins, said, ``TheJustice Department, I am told, is looking into the case.''   A federal law enforcement source said the FBI was reviewingstatutes to determine if the murder of Higgins was a violation of a1986 anti-terrorist act.   There was an obvious sense of relief in Washington that Cicippiohad been spared.   ``I would guess just offhand ... it could ease the tensions,''said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``It might givediplomacy a chance to work.''   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said, ``We'reall gratified of course at the so-called extension.''   Mitchell said that, ``The obviously proper and humane course ofaction would be to release Mr. Cicippio and the other innocentpersons who are being held hostage and we hope very much that willbe the result.''   At the White House, Fitzwater said, ``We regard this as anencouraging and hopeful development.''   ``But it still does not answer our continuing concern forrelease of all hostages,'' Fitzwater said in a written statement.``We urge that all parties in the region use whatever influencethey have to end the tragedy of hostage taking and to release thoseremaining in captivity. And we express our appreciation to allthose who have been thus far trying to help.''   Fitzwater said the president made telephone calls to at least adozen leaders in the Middle East and elsewhere over the past twodays.   ``I don't think we had any signals from any of the heads ofstate'' that Cicippio was about to be spared, the press spokesmansaid.   The U.S. diplomacy was aimed at friends and foes alike.   Fitzwater said it was impossible to say what prompted thereprieve for Cicippio. ``We certainly think the diplomaticovertures made a difference but we can't read Hezbollah's mind andthey haven't told us,'' he said.   Asked if the Soviet Union had been influential, he replied,``It's difficult to say. We have had some feedback from the Sovietsthat indicated they were sympathetic to the problem.''   Fitzwater said the blitz of diplomatic contacts and intensefocus on the issue ``may open up some opportunity over the longhaul'' in resolving the hostage problem.   ``It's impossible to point to any specific improvement but thehope it it won't settle back to the way it was ... I don't thinkwe're back at square one,'' he said.   As parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani was sworn in as Iran'snew president, the United States made an open appeal for his nationto turn away from the radicalism of the late Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini. Iran is believed to exert considerable influence over thekidnappers in Lebanon.   ``We certainly are hopeful that the elevation of Rafsanjani is apositive sign for U.S. relations,'' said Fitzwater, adding,however, that ``our optimism is very guarded.''   Nevertheless, Fitzwater said, ``we are hopeful that his presencewould spell some opening for a changed relationship with the Westand feel there must be some cracks in the structure that Khomeinicreated against the United States.''   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, asked aboutIran's role in the situation, indicated that authorities there weretrying to be helpful.   ``We have been in touch with Iran through a variety of channelsand at this time have no reason to believe that Iran is not dealingwith this matter in a serious way,'' she said. She added that theSoviet Union has tried to be helpful and that Syria has expressed asimilar desire.   While insisting that Bush had not made a final decision aboutmilitary action, Fitzwater said, ``all of the foundation planninghas been done and consideration of every scenario has been taken.''   Military sources, speaking only on condition of anonymity, saidthe aircraft carrier Coral Sea was within striking distance ofLebanese shores, carrying some 65 planes, including FA-18 attackfighters and A-6 bombers.   The carrier's battle group was bolstered by the nuclear-poweredcruisers Mississippi and Virginia, as well as the Aegis cruiser SanJacinto, also in the area.   NBC News reported Thursday night that jets from the Coral Seawere electronically sparring with air defense systems in Lebanon,racing towards the coast to get Syrian batteries to turn on theirradar. That would enable spy plans to analyze the radar signals andlater use the same signals to jam the defense systems during anattack.   Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist, a Pentagon spokesman, said, ``Wedon't discuss operations. I can't confirm'' the network report.   The New York Times said in Friday editions that Bush had ``allbut decided'' to attack terrorist strongholds in eastern Lebanon,including the Baalbek base of 2,000 Iranian revolutionary guards,if a hostage had been killed.   A White House spokesman reached at home Thursday night, whospoke only on condition of non-identification, said, ``To myknowlegde that is not true'' but added ``we just don't discussthose sorts of things.''   The flagship of the 6th Fleet, the guided-missile cruiserBelknap, was on station east of Crete, with fleet commander ViceAdm. James D. Williams aboard, the sources said.   Steaming towards Lebanon from the mid-Mediterranean was thebattleship Iowa, armed with 16-inch guns and bristling with Harpoonand Tomahawk cruise surface-to-surface mssiles. The Tomahawks havea range of some 450 nautical miles.   The aircraft carrier America, which broke off its port call inSingapore earlier this week, was headed across the Indian Ocean andexpected to be on station in the north Arabian Sea in about fourdays, the sources said.   That places the carrier, with about 85 planes, within range ofpossible targets in the Persian Gulf and Iran, the sources said.</TEXT></DOC>
