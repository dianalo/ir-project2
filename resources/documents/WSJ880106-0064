Last month Mr. Nobrega, who has twice been deputy finance minister, was appointed acting finance minister after Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira resigned over policy disagreements with President Jose Sarney.    At a news conference last night, Mr. Nobrega promised quick and discreet foreign-debt negotiations and an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. He also said that Mr. Sarney instructed him to fight Brazil's rising inflation, now approaching an annual rate of 400%, and to reduce the government budget deficit and the role of the state in the economy.    Mr. Nobrega's appointment comes at a time of heightened concern about Brazil's bank debt. Several bankers have expressed doubts about their ability to complete a conventional debt rescheduling and loan package for Brazil in light of a recently announced innnovative debt plan for Mexico.    But unlike his predecessor, Mr. Nobrega, who is known as a discreet technocrat who follows orders, isn't likely to try radical domestic policies to address the country's staggering economic problems. Commented a Brazil-based U.S. banker: &quot;He's been around for some time, he knows the ropes. He isn't politically oriented and has some experience abroad. He has the confidence of President Sarney, which none of his predecessors had.&quot;    An economist who began his career at state-owned Banco do Brasil in 1963, Mr. Nobrega is generally well-regarded by his country's creditors. &quot;He's a civil servant with a lot of experience who is well-known internally and outside the country,&quot; said a senior U.S. banker who is familiar with Brazil.    Nevertheless, several bankers said Mr. Nobrega, who will be the fourth finance minister in less than three years, may, like Mr. Bresser, turn out to be a stopgap who survives only until many political issues in Brazil are settled.    Mr. Bresser, who was finance minister for little more than six months, resigned because President Sarney cut back Mr. Bresser's proposed package of economic measures, designed to reduce government spending and raise state revenues.    Brazil, meantime, is set to resume debt negotiations with its creditor banks next Monday in New York on its estimated $70 billion of foreign bank debt and accrued interest. Brazil last February suspended interest payments on its about $67 billion of foreign bank debt, and has only just made its first interest payment since then. The U.S. banker in Brazil expects the new minister to honor the commitment made by Mr. Bresser to resume interest payments this month.    Fernando Milliet, Brazil's central bank president, is expected to lead Brazil's delegation to New York, bankers said. But there is a question mark over Mr. Milliet's future as central bank chief. He was appointed by Mr. Bresser, and many Brazilians and bankers expect he may be replaced. Fernao Bracher, who was previously Brazil's chief debt negotiator, has already resigned. Mr. Bracher, like Mr. Milliet, was appointed by Mr. Bresser. Mr. Nobrega said the central bank president will head the negotiating team, but he wouldn't confirm whether it would be the current president, Mr. Milliet.    A proposed debt plan for Mexico worked out with the help of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. may have further complicated Brazil's debt talks, some bankers said. Under that program, the Mexican government's creditor banks will have the opportunity to exchange their debts at a discount for as much as $10 billion of new bonds issued by Mexico. These new Mexican bonds will be backed by 10-year zero-coupon bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. Zero-coupon bonds pay interest only at maturity. This program affords Mexico some debt relief.    Brazil is now expected to request a similar plan. Last week Ulysses Guimaraes, president of the Brazilian assembly, met with Gonzalo de las Heras, head of Morgan's Latin American department, apparently to discuss the Mexican debt program. Rubens Antonio Barbosa, a diplomat and adviser to Brazil's finance minister, said, soon after the new Mexican plan was announced on Dec. 29, &quot;this is one of the ideas&quot; Brazil would present in its forthcoming debt talks.    But Brazil's foreign-exchange and gold reserves are weak, at an estimated level of about $4.6 billion, compared with Mexico's estimated $11 billion. The Mexican debt proposal relies on that country putting up as much as $2 billion to buy the U.S. zero-coupon bonds. Moreover, Mexico has an economic program with the IMF, a commitment Brazil has so far rejected.    Mr. Nobrega also faces a difficult task at home. He said he will &quot;combat inflation decisively by rigorous control of government accounts to reduce the public deficit.&quot; But that is an ambition no finance minister has fulfilled during the current administration.    Mr. Nobrega's appointment formalizes a political break between Mr. Sarney and the center-left Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, which dominates the legislature and selected the previous two finance ministers. Now the apolitical Mr. Nobrega will serve Mr. Sarney alone. </TEXT></DOC>
