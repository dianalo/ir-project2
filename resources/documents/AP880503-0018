The company, GA Technologies of San Diego, Calif., built theonly working commercial gas-cooled reactor in the United States,the Fort St. Vrain plant of Colorado Public Service Co. near Denver.   A joint U.S.-Soviet committee on peaceful uses of atomic energylast week visited GA Technologies for talks on development ofso-called modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactors.   In a ceremony at the State Department on Monday in which theheads of both delegations signed a document recommending renewal ofthe cooperation agreement, the Soviet chairman, Alexandor N.Protsenko, said, ``We think the prospects are very good forcollaboration with (GA Technologies) in this area, as well as withother companies.''   The agreement was begun by President Nixon and Soviet leaderLeonid Brezhnev in 1973. It was renewed in 1983 and 1985.   Asked just what form cooperation with GA Technologies mighttake, Protsenko, who is chairman of the state committee for theutilization of atomic energy, said through an interpreter theSoviet and United States delegations were discussing ``a possiblecollaborative program with (the company) in the context of thegeneral agreement.''   But, he added, ``We don't exclude the possibility that ourcooperation will lead to a time where we might have a separateagreement'' with GA Technologies.   Gas-cooled reactors have been widely used in Europe, but neitherthe Soviet Union nor the United States has favored them forcivilian power.   They do offer certain safety advantages, such as slow reactionto disturbances. Modular designs, which could be built efficientlyin small sizes so utilities could add generating capacity only asneeded, have attracted increasing attention both in the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union, and the Soviets plan to completeconstruction of two in 1995.   The modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor is ``a goodexample of a safe, economically feasible new generation ofreactor,'' Protsenko said.</TEXT></DOC>
