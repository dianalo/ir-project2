The mechanism of oxygen interactionwith the surface of films is determined by the initial structure andthe fluence. The action of irradiation by antimony ions is manifestedin merger of individual fragments of the film and the decrease of thedegree of misorientation of twin individuals to a small level. Changesof the structural characteristics of the films agree with a change ofelectrophysical parameters due to ion doping.</TEXT></DOC>
