Police said the howitzer shells landed in a scattered pattern inChristian territory and no casualties were reported. They said theChristians held their fire.   Moslem-Christian artillery duels began five weeks ago anddeveloped into the worst sectarian fighting since 1985 in Lebanon's14-year-old civil war. Police give the casualties, nearly allcivilians, as 180 killed and 619 wounded.   Gen. Michel Aoun, who commands the 20,000 Christians ofLebanon's army, imposed a blockade March 6 on illegal militia-runports that deprive the government of an estimated $100 million ayear in revenue.   Walid Jumblatt's Druse militia started shooting two days laterand Syrian gunners soon joined them. Syria has 40,000 soldiers inLebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.   Bernard Kouchner, French minister for humanitarian assistance,arrived ahead of the two ships carrying food, fuel and medicalsupplies, which have caused an argument between Moslems andChristians.   Moslems claim France, from which Lebanon became independent in1943, favors the Christians. The French government has expressedconcern over the fate of Lebanon's Christians.   Kouchner spent 45 minutes with acting Premier Salim Hoss, whoheads a Moslem cabinet that has competed with a Christiangovernment led by Aoun since a political crisis began in September.   Hoss convened his cabinet afterward, then issued a statementsaying the Moslem government rejected ``the French donation untilthe French stand toward the Lebanese crisis is clarified.''   Kouchner told reporters France was determined to deliver the aidto ``all the Lebanese'' and would meet with several leaders to planthe distribution.   He said French policy ``supports a political settlement inLebanon.''   Jumblatt has warned the French not to bring the ships into aChristian port.   Before meeting in west Beirut with Hoss, a Sunni Moslem,Kouchner conferred with Aoun in Baabda, the Christian suburb wherethe presidential palace is located. By unwritten agreement since1943, Lebanon's president is a Christian, the premier a Sunni andthe parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.   The relief ships left for Lebanon last week. France has not saidwhen they will arrive, but they are expected Wednesday.   One carries food and fuel. The other is a hospital ship withbeds, surgical facilities and medical supplies.   Fear has been expressed that more fighting will accompany theships' arrival. A French envoy who was in Lebanon last week _Jean-Francois Deniau of the National Assembly's foreign affairscommittee _ was quoted Tuesday as saying it ``would be an act ofwar against France'' to fire on the ships.   ``If they fire, it is clear that they want to destroy Lebanon,''he was quoted as saying in the Tours, France daily La NouvelleRepublique du Centre-Ouest.   Youssef Aridi, a grocer in Moslem west Beirut, said: ``I thinkWednesday will be a bad day. I won't leave home. If they shell theFrench, God knows what will happen.''   Lebanon's latest government crisis began when President AminGemayel's six-year term ended in September and Parliament could notagree on a successor. Gemayel chose Aoun, the army comnmander, tolead an interim administration and Moslems swore allegiance toHoss, the incumbent premier.   The army also split on sectarian lines, with Aoun commanding theChristians and Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib taking charge of the 22,000Moslems.</TEXT></DOC>
