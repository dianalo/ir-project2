Freezing conditions areinvestigated theoretically, and an approximation for calculating thelimiting temperature of freezing-up is presented. The approximation isreliable for off-air with a low moisture content. For higher moisturecontent including the values commonly encountered in HVAC engineering,the freezing temperature was determined experimentally. The experimentalprocedure and results are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
