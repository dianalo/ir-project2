(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Taking an Objective LookandM;Two years ago, object-oriented languages and programming environments werebeing billed as the next great IS productivity tools.andP;  Using such technology,vendors promised, would increase programming productivity not by a mere 10 to15%, but 10- to 15-fold.andM;Object programming--which lets software developers and users write programsby assembling modular blocks of routines and procedures rather than stringingout thousands of lines of linear code--was also lauded for other potentialbenefits.andP;  Chief among them was the ability of programmers to design large,complex, highly interactive systems that are nearly impossible to build andmaintain using today's structured techniques.andM;Not all of those bold predictions have been fulfilled.andP;  &quot;There's a whole setof fundamental requirements that are lacking: tools, access languages,fourth-generation languages, data backup and recovery,&quot; says Jonathan Eunice,a manager for Tarrytown, N.Y.-based market researcher D.H.andP;  Brown, inexplaining why object technology hasn't reached the takeoff stage.andP;  &quot;Today'sobject database vendors are small start-ups with just barely enough resourcesto build their basic product and put together some semblance of salesorganization,&quot; he says, referring to such companies as thenot-ready-for-prime-time players.andM;Yet enthusiasm for object-oriented software has never been higher.andP;  Someexperts even go so far as to use the word passion when describing thetechnology (see &quot;The Object of Desire,&quot; May 1, 1988, p.andP;  37).andP;  The concepthas enormous appeal because object languages and tools hold the potential toenhance the performance of professional programmers and to let nontechnicalpeople create some of their own programs.andP;  That would solve a problem thatother hoped-for solutions--fourth-generation languages and informationcenters--have failed to alleviate: the chronic backlog of applications.andM;Major systems vendors are beginning to include mention of object features intheir products.andP;  Conferences on the subject are springing up.andP;  Companies areeven starting to invest modestly in the technology, though severalinterviewed by DATAMATION caution that they're merely experimenting with it.andM;&quot;We're looking at it with some interest.andP;  But a lot of things have to happenbefore it becomes the sort of software you would bet your business on,&quot; saysDavid Tryon, systems analyst and methodologist for Pacific Bell in San Ramon,Calif., citing reliable systems development methodologies and robustrelationships to databases as two areas of needed improvement.andM;&quot;We're strictly in the evaluation mode,&quot; says Michael Viste, seniordevelopment engineer in Allen-Bradley Co.'s advanced technology group inMilwaukee, which has been experimenting for a year with two object products,a language called SmallTalk and an object-oriented database called Gemstone.andO;&quot;There's no goal to move whole hog into an object-oriented programmingenvironment.&quot;andM;MMindful of the slow acceptance of any potentially critical technology,object vendors are going out of their way to underplay their products toavoid disappointing users.andP;  &quot;The word object has been hyped a lot in the pastcouple of years,&quot; says Michael Connell, general manager at Servio Logic Corp.andO;in Beaverton, Ore., the developer of Gemstone.andP;  &quot;It's almost like the frenzysurrounding AI [artificial intelligence] a few years back.andP;  Anything with anicon is said to be object-oriented.&quot;andM;Innovative Systems Techniques Inc. (INSYTE) of Newton, Mass., has sold afinancial analysis system called Vision to about seven investment banks andbrokerage houses in the past two years.andP;  Key to the system is an objectdatabase and proprietary object-oriented programming language that lets userspull financial information from a variety of commercial databases to performspecialized yield analysis.andM;&quot;When we first started selling Vision, we never mentioned object technology,&quot;says Richard Newman, INSYTE's marketing director.andP;  &quot;When object-oriented gotto be a buzzword, we started to talk about it a little bit, but I'm not suretalking about it has been a help or a hindrance.andP;  Our market tends to beconservative.andP;  The idea that we're selling something futuristic could scareour customers away--especially if we were to be lumped in with the AI set.&quot;andM;Big Payoffs in the 1990s?andM;The conservatism stems from the realization that up to five years may passbefore object technology starts to deliver its promised benefits in a bigway.andP;  Facted into the incubation period, reminiscent of the one that therelational database market experienced before bursting on the IS scene, aremanagement and professional issues, as well as the expected technicalhurdles.andP;  The considerable difference between structured and objectprogramming means that the latter will face a steep learning curve.andM;&quot;A move to object-oriented programming can mean a major sell to the entirecompany,&quot; says Norman Kerth, a consultant in Portland, Ore.andP;  &quot;In many casesthe people who best understand the need for object-programming are technicalworkers who may not be in a position to persuade upper management.&quot;andP;  Thosetechnical workers also may resist using somebody else's software blocks(objects) to build an application, particularly if such materials lack properdocumentation.andP;  Once a user organization does build a library of objects, thequestion arises: Who controls the library--central IS or individual productgroups?andM;The proper use of object technology requires a substantial customerinvestment in training.andP;  Unless programmers are willing to go through athree-to six-month education process designed to change the way they thinkabout systems design, they probably won't be able to do true objectprogramming.andM;Heightened Vendor ActivityandM;The object paradigm is, to be sure, a radical departure from past and presentprogramming frameworks.andP;  Born in the early 1970s at Xerox Corp.'s Palo AltoResearch Center (PARC), the idea was to develop a language (SmallTalk) thatbypassed the abstract thinking of conventional programming.andP;  Doing so, Xeroxresearchers thought, would allow children to create programs by stringingtogether blocks of prewritten software.andP;  Like many things to come out ofPARC, the idea was ahead of its time.andM;Hoping to be for once the one to cash in on PARC's innovation, Xerox lastyear created, a subsidiary, ParcPlace Systems, to market SmallTalk.andP;  Xeroxhas also lilcensed SmallTalk to an assortment of vendors: Apple,Hewlett-Packard Co., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Tektronix Inc.andP;  Thesecompanies' interest signals the enormous commercial potential forobject-oriented products, which is attracting both start-ups andbillion-dollar vendors to the field.andM;ATandamp;T's object programming language C+ + is gradually moving from researchlabs into the hands of object software vendors and advanced technology groupswithin corporations.andP;  HP recently introduced New Wave, an object-orientedprogramming environment that will enable programmers to link software objectstogether.andP;  Microsoft is working on an object programming environment.andO;Elements of object-oriented technology are showing up in new computerhardware, most notably IBM's AS/400 and the NeXT INc. workstation.andP;  Inaddition to object-programming languages, a proliferation of companies aredeveloping and selling early versions of object-oriented databases (seesidebar, &quot;A Partner, not a Predator&quot;).andM;Some Inherent AdvantagesandM;Vendors activity notwithstanding, object technology remains difficult formost programmers to grasp because it rejects the idea tha code and datashould be separate.andP;  Instead, it binds them together in modules or objects.andO;Each object, in fact, encapsulates both data and a set of instructions thatdescribes behavior and attributes of the object.andP;  Objects may vary in sizefrom a small routine to an entire application.andP;  Messages passed among objectsdetermine how one object interacts with another.andM;Encapsulation offers a few advantages over traditional programming:andM;* Complex relationships between data elements difficult to capture in theabstract can often be more accurately modeled by the structure of objects andthe messages that determine how the objects interact with one another.andM;&quot;Objects let users model their own world,&quot; says Esther Dyson, editor of&quot;Release 1.0,&quot; an industry newsletter.andM;* Interdependence among objects is strictly limited by the messages that theycan send and receive.andP;  A change within one object will not affect thebehavior of another object.andP;  That means maintenance of an object system willnot be nearly the headache it can be with existing large systems.andM;* Larger systems using interrelated but independent objects can be built.andM;The Airline Marketing Tactician, a program designed to let airlines balanceno-shows and overbooked seats on a flight-by-flight basis, is a good exampleof an application that fits well into the object framework, but which wouldhave been difficult, if not impossible, to write in linear code.andP;  Written inSmall Talk, the program estimates demand for the half a dozen or more fareclasses that carriers typically offer, from full-fare to deep-discount.andM;&quot;It might have been possible to write this application using conventionalprogramming, but it would have taken a multimillion-dollar budget and 20people,&quot; says Ken Stevens, chairman of BehavHeuristic, developer of theAirline Marketing Tactician.andP;  Using Small Talk enabled the College Park, Md.,andO;company to develop a prototype in three years with just two people.andM;Another key feature of the object approach is a quality known as&quot;inheritance,&quot; which allows the attributes and behaviors of one object to beincorporated into another object.andP;  Objects can be structured in classhierarchies: plant, angiosperm, tree, chestnut and so on.andP;  To add a newsubclass (American chestnut), the programmer need not start from scratch,rather he needs only to specify the attributes that differentiate the newobject from the other objects in the class hierarchy.andM;The benefits of inheritance can be seen in a graphics application, where theinstructions to display or manipulate a shape can be inherited by othersubclass objects.andP;  Bart Shutte, manager of object-based development withAndersen Consulting in Chicago, found inheritance to be a boon when he usedSmallTalk to help a client build four graphics application packages.andP;  &quot;Ittook two of us four months to build the first one,&quot; Shutte says.andP;  &quot;The otherthree we built in one month each.&quot;andM;Software Libraries of the FutureandM;Just as inheritance speeds the development of applications, there are evengreater advantages that may result from object software's reusability.andP;  Vastlibraries of object routines and procedures, even object applications, couldone day become available.andP;  Once that happens, off-the-shelf commodity objectscould be assembled to form applications the way off-the-shelf integratedcircuits have speeded up and reduced the cost of computer hardware.andM;The development of reusable object libraries is moving slowly, but it'sstarting to happen.andP;  Applied Intelligent Systems Inc. (AISI) is an Ann Arbor,Mich., company that builds machine vision systems used for assembly andinspection in the automotive and electronics industries.andP;  The company isusing Stepstone's Objective C product to convert into objects its library ofabout 450 functions (some of which need to be packaged into higher levelsoftware with each system it sells).andP;  The conversion, once completed, willenable AISI to build semicustom systems much more efficiently.andM;The project is moving along well but slowly.andP;  It's also not yieldingastronomical productivity increases.andP;  One of the problems is the steeplearning curve for using an object-oriented language.andP;  Since C programmersmust learn to forget old ways of doing things, it takes about the same timeto retrain an existing programmer as it does to break in a newprogrammer--three to six months.andP;  &quot;We're seeing more like a two- tothree-fold improvement,&quot; says Dave Coupland, AISI's manager of softwareengineering.andM;Improvement in the price/performance of computer systems has removed oneminor technical obstacle to object-oriented programming--the fact that itconsumes about 10% more computing power.andP;  Today's workstations, in fact, caneasily run most object applications.andP;  Moreover, hybrid languages likeObjective C and + + offer better performance by grafting object capabilitiesonto conventional languages.andP;  &quot;There's adequate computer power available,&quot;says Jeff McKenna, a consultant in Taulitin, Ore.andM;The bigger issue, say McKenna and others, is how much power IS executives andtheir superiors can exert in influencing their staffs to objectively assessobject technology.andP;  The management team's awareness of how programmerefficiency affects organizational profitability can only help the cause ofobject technology.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
