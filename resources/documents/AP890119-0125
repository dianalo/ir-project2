Chants of ``Gestapo! Gestapo!'' rang out as white-helmeted riotpolice charged the crowd about 30 minutes after it gathered,swinging their batons indiscriminantly. More than a dozen protestersappeared badly beaten and at least 10 were taken away by police.   Water cannons were brought onto Wenceslas Square but were notused.   Wenceslas Square has been the site of five straight days ofrallies, which began Sunday to commemorate the 20th anniversary ofJan Palach's death. Palach committed suicide by setting himselfafire Jan. 16, 1969 to protest the Soviet-led invasion ofCzechoslovakia.   Dissidents said today authorities had detained a human rightsactivist and informed at least two others they will be prosecuted inconnection with demonstrations Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.   The public display of dissent is unprecedented since the weeksafter the 1968 invasion.   About 15 minutes after today's rally began, a police van with amegaphone asked the crowd to disperse, telling people they weretaking part in an illegal demonstration.   Riot police poured into the half-mile-long square fromsidestreets when protesters refused to leave, charging the crowd andpushing them along the boulevard.   On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, police used water cannons, dogs,truncheons and tear gas to break up crowds.   Vaclav Maly, a signatory of the Charter 77 human rights document,said activist Martin Palous was detained by police at his hometoday. Palous addressed Wednesday's rally, reading a Charter 77protest of arrests made during the earlier rallies.   On Monday, activists Vaclav Havel and Jana Sternova were arrestedwhen they tried to lay flowers in memory of Palach. A prosecutorinformed activists that those two will face hooliganism charges,Maly said. He said the charge carries a maximum jail sentence of twoyears.   Another activist, Jiri Dienstbier, said dissident Jana Petrova ofthe Independent Peace Association also will be prosecuted. Therewere no details on the charges. Petrova spoke at an unofficial rallyin December.   Families of three other people detained Monday said they wereinformed the detainees face charges of obstructing the duty of anofficer, which carries a maximum penalty of six months.   In an unusual move, the names and addresses of all 14 peopledetained Monday were published by the state-run media. Communistauthorities accused the dissidents and the Western media offomenting unrest.   The Communist Pary daily Rude Pravo said Wednesday night that ``acluster of about 1,000 people in the upper half of Wenceslas Squaremade the usual everyday traffic impossible.''   ``The purpose of this unauthorized gathering was also this timeevident from chanted slogans attacking the Socialist system and itsleading representative,'' Rude Pravo said.   At one point Wednesday, several hundred people took up a chant of``Jakes Out,'' referring to Communist Party leader Milos Jakes.   ``Initiators of such actions want to destabilize our society,create pressure on the Socialist state,'' Rude Pravo said.</TEXT></DOC>
