<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0441 </DOCNO><TEXT>An alternative method to that set out by the International Commissionon Radiological Protection (ICRP) for implementing the optimization (ALARA)principle of radiation protection is proposed. The method follows directlyfrom the basic dose limitation system and naturally integrates the threecomponents of the system. An essential feature of the method is that'all exposures' is taken to mean 'each and every one' rather than the'sum of individual doses', as in the usual method using the collectivedose concept. The method draws on established techniques from optimizationtheory and those aspects of micro-economic theory which form the basisof cost-benefit analysis. The method takes separate account of both thedirect costs to the community of the effects of radiation exposures andeach individual's 'risk-benefit' attitudes to radiation exposures. Theconundrum concerning the 'value of a life' turns out to be operationallyand quantitatively irrelevant. Various constraints including the doselimits, economic and social constraints and natural physical constraintsare included in the method which leads directly to a standard form problemin mathematical programming. A practical advantage of the method is thatit is conceptually consistent with the operational methods used and judgementsmade regularly by health physicists and radiation safety officers. Whilethe proposed method allows an optimization problem to be readily specified,it does require some familiarity with optimization solution techniquesin larger applications.
