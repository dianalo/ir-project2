Voting by phone -- astelecommunications technology improves and voter participation drops to nearrecord lows -- is gaining attention, if not support, from across the country.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WHY NOT JUST REACH OUT AND CAST VOTE BY PHONE?  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;The timing is right, both from a technological standpoint andpolitically,&quot; said Evan Ravitz, a computer analyst turned street entertainerwho is founder and director of the Boulder-based organization Voting byPhone.;    Led by the 38-year-old tightrope walker/juggler/comedian, theorganization draws technical support from an array of respected scientists,scholars and politicians who maintain that allowing Americans to vote bytelephone would be easier and more ecologically sound and, above all, wouldrevive a democracy that has the lowest voter participation rate of any in theworld.;    The concept is not a new one. First suggested by futurist R.Buckminster Fuller about 50 years ago, it has been proposed, shot down andrevived several times since.;    &quot;The idea turns up with a regularity that istruly astonishing,&quot; said Bill Kimberling, deputy director of the FederalElection Commission's National Clearinghouse on Election Administration. &quot;Ithink these people have been watching 'Star Trek' a little too much.&quot;;   Citing the potential for vote fraud and violations of voter privacy, he added,&quot;we looked into it and concluded that, even if it were technologicallyfeasible, the cost of the technology would far exceed whatever benefit mightaccrue.&quot;;    Ravitz, however, believes a virtually foolproof system could bedevised, and would, in the long run, save money. And the price would not betoo much to pay to save a democracy in distress, he says.;    Nationally, onlyabout 36 percent of the 186 million Americans eligible to vote cast ballots inNovember, matching the lowest turnout of the past 50 years. Many politicalanalysts expect the downward trend to continue.;    His organization is tryingto legalize telephone voting in Boulder through a city ballot measure in thenext election, and it hopes that, by the 1994 election, residents here will beletting their fingers do the voting.;    Under the nationwide system the groupproposes, all registered voters would be given 14-digit voter identificationnumbers. To help protect against fraud, only one in every 100,000 possiblesequences of numbers would be a valid voter identification number. Voterswould call a free telephone number from push-button phones, punch in theiridentification numbers, then vote on candidates and ballot issues by punchingother numbers.;    While backers acknowledge there are kinks to be worked out-- most related to ensuring security and voter privacy -- researchers say thetechnology exists to resolve those concerns.;    &quot;There's no doubt in my mindthat a cost-effective, user-friendly system could be designed,&quot; said JosephPelton, director of the University of Colorado's graduate telecommunicationsprogram and technical adviser to Voting by Phone. &quot;Remember that, 20 yearsago, people thought it would be crazy to trust your money to a bank machine;now everybody uses them.&quot;;    &quot;By next November, we should be ready for afull-scale test -- a demonstration process that will debunk these concerns,&quot;Pelton said. &quot;It's going to happen, if not in Boulder, then certainlysomewhere in the next few years.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOHN WOESTENDIEK, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Boulder, Colo.  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910130  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  581  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 30, 199100030244,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
