Persistent winds blow throughout the year. Precipitation over the 1002 area is light but frequent, with summer drizzle and light winter snows. Regardless of season, clear days on the coast are uncommon. Fog and stratus clouds prevail during the summer. In the winter, fog and blowing snow reduce visibility. The sun is continuously above the horizon from mid-May to the end of July, and continuously below the horizon from the end of November to mid-January.&quot;    Those words from an environmental-impact statement prepared for Congress by the U.S. Department of Interior give you some idea of what it's like in a place called &quot;1002 area,&quot; a jolly little Beaufort seacoast enclave in the northeast corner of Alaska. Its caribou, polar bears, a few musk oxen and approximately 200 Eskimos don't get many visitors. But to the stateside wilderness lobby, 1002 area is a precious jewel it will protect.    From what? From oil drilling. According to geological surveys, the one thing 1002 has is a very large amount of oil. Interior wants to open it to oil and gas drilling.    But 1002 also is a chunk, albeit a small one, of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In the American political culture, wildlife refuges belong to the wilderness lobby. Rep. Mo Udall (D., Ariz.) won the race to be the first congressman to promise blocking legislation. He even proposed to make 1002 a &quot;wilderness&quot; area, which we suppose means those poor Eskimos should forget about ever owning outboard motors or snowmobiles.    We have resisted Interior Secretary Hodel's arguments that the U.S. runs a national security risk as its foreign-oil dependency rises. But we are more convinced now that we know that Beltway mores bar American presidents from recognizing the strategic importance of Iran and the Persian Gulf.    At the very least it seems imprudent to lock up forever important energy resources. Quite a few congressmen we expect to join the Udall bandwagon have been running around waving their arms about the U.S. trade deficit. Those who believe balanced trade important surely don't think a rising volume of oil imports, even at lower prices, points in that direction.    The 1002 area, which is next door to the big Prudhoe Bay oil play, constitutes about four-tenths of 1% of the vast land area of Alaska, most of which is wilderness even where it lacks that official designation. North Slope development was fought over, too, with the wilderness lobby demanding pipeline underpasses so as not to disturb the migratory patterns of the caribou. As it turned out, the caribou didn't need or use their special walkways and seemed to enjoy hanging around the pipeline.    Indeed, man and his works have hardly touched that hostile land above the Arctic Circle. But there is a mystique about pristine wilderness. No doubt about it. And those most deeply imbued with it are not inclined to compromise with those who think a bit of practicality, however unromantic, is not entirely inappropriate to human affairs. There will be a fight over 1002 in Congress. We propose one rule. Whoever wins has to agree to spend the 1987 Christmas holidays on the shores of the Beaufort Sea. </TEXT></DOC>
