Walter Thompson Co., is back on the acquisition trail.    Advertising industry executives said WPP, a London marketing services group, is close to agreeing to buy a Hispanic ad agency, Mendoza, Dillon andamp; Asociados Inc., Newport Beach, Calif.    One source said WPP would pay $10 million up front for the agency, with future payments based on earnings over the next five years, bringing the total purchase price to as much as $26.5 million. If all goes as planned, the acquisition could be announced early this week, they said.    The sources also said that WPP is evaluating several other relatively small acquisitions.    Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive officer, couldn't be reached for comment, and other WPP officials declined to comment. Mendoza Dillon couldn't be reached.    Securities analysts said, however, that Mr. Sorrell recently has expressed interest in buying a Hispanic ad agency to help round out his mix of marketing companies. WPP's other units include design, specialty advertising and public relations firms as well as Thompson.    Hispanic ad agencies have become attractive acquisitions recently because Hispanic advertising is growing so much faster than general advertising. Some estimates put Hispanic ad revenue growth at more than 20% a year, while general U.S. advertising has been growing less than 8% a year overall.    According to Advertising Age estimates, closely held Mendoza Dillon billed $29.3 million in 1986. The Standard Directory of Advertising Agencies, which receives its information directly from agencies, puts Mendoza Dillon's annual billings at about $40 million. </TEXT></DOC>
