Gillespie himself, in his utterances _ ``I'm in New York now; Igot to show off'' _ in conducting with a hip wiggle and in playinghis bent-bell trumpet, brought joy to the Tuesday night concert. Hefollowed a brief set by Marlon Jordan, 17-year-old trumpeter fromNew Orleans, and his mainstream quartet and an hour by singerCarmen McRae, who was in a joyless mood.   Gillespie's band began on a peak of musical excitement, with``Toccata'' from ``Gillespiana Suite,'' composed by Lalo Schifrin.The four French horns used in that piece then left the stage to the17-piece band, which sustained the pace with ``Emanon.'' Dizzy saidhe composed it for a recording in the 1940s and named it ``NoName'' backwards.   Trumpeter Jon Faddis played exceedingly high and fast withabsolute definition and clarity in ``A Night in Tunisia.'' Dizzyintroduced that one as ``a tune closely associated with me overmany, many, many decades, mainly because I wrote it. It haswithstood the visicitudes of the contingent world and moved in anodyssy into the realm of the metaphysical.''   Saxophonist Sam Rivers was warmly melodic in ``Round Midnight.''The concert ended with some bop for big band, Gillespie's 1940s``Things To Come.''   Miss McRae sang ``For All We Know'' and ``Inside a Silent Tear''with depth of feeling for the lyrics but conveyed a lack of joy inwhat she was doing.   Her usual pianist, Eric Gunnison, was joined by bassist GeorgeMraz and drummer Al Foster, who were on an album she has cut ofThelonious Monk songs.   They were joined for seven interesting Monk songs by theoutstanding saxophonist Clifford Jordan.   Most of the Monk songs she sang had lyrics by Jon Hendricks.They included ``Ruby, My Dear,'' ``Ugly Beauty,'' ``Monk's Dream,''``Straight, No Chaser'' and ``In Walked Bud.''</TEXT></DOC>
