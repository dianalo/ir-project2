Despite the pardon and release Friday of poet and human rightsadvocate Israel Gutierrez Hernandez, activists complained thathundreds of others remain behind prison bars.   ``I am very excited, I feel like this is a dream, but I don'thave much else to say,'' the government news agency Notimex quotedGutierrez Hernandez as saying when he was released from state prisonin the central city of San Luis Potosi.   He served five years of a 10-year sentence for robbery, criminalassociation and possession of weapons. The 37-year-old poet, who hasdenied the charges, was known as an adviser to peasant groupsfighting for land rights.   The program unveiled this week by President Carlos Salinas deGortari appears aimed at appeasing human rights activists who sayhundreds have been jailed or killed for their political beliefs.   Interior Minister Fernando Gutierrez Barrios said the 403prisoners to be freed were jailed for violations committed forsocial and political reasons. A statement from the president'soffice said Salinas would work with state governors to free 402other prisoners jailed for various offenses nationwide. It gave notimetable.   Salinas also pledged to send to Congress a list of proposed penalcode reforms that would make it easier to pardon some prisoners whocommitted crimes for political reasons, the statement said.   Luis Ortiz Monasterio, the department's human rights director,said Friday about 1,200 people jailed for crimes stemming fromsocial struggles were expected to be released, Notimex said.   He was quoted as saying the list of 403 prisoners includesinmates from only 10 of Mexico's 31 states, because other stategovernments denied having anyone jailed for social or politicallymotivated crimes.   Rosario Ibarra, the country's most prominent human rightscrusader, said the government made the proposal because oppositiongroups have pressed for release of political prisoners.   But she said the program falls short.   ``What we're sure of is that we will have to intensify thestruggle for the the 1,000 prisoners whose release we are demandingand for the 548 `disappeared' who must be accounted for,'' thenewspaper El Universal quoted her as saying.   The ``disappeared'' refers to political prisoners whosewhereabouts are unknown and who are presumed dead.   Mrs. Ibarra this month held a hunger strike outside the InteriorDepartment to press for release of the prisoners and an explanationof the whereabouts of missing prisoners.   The government previously has released prisoners, including thosejailed during the 1968 student movement, in what amounted to a tacitacknowledgement that it had political prisoners.   An editorial in the leftist newspaper La Jornada said the pardon``should be viewed as a political gesture ... as a response topetitions and demands.   ``The question of human rights continues to be a delicate matterwith points on the agenda that still aren't resolved,'' it said.   ``The political disappearances, tortures, persecutions, illegaldetentions add up to a group of anticonstitutional and injuriousactions for the national harmony.''   Amnesty International said in its 1988 report that arbitrarydetentions and killings of peasant and Indian group memberscontinue, particularly in land disputes. Torture and othermistreatment of prisoners also continue, and at least 23 politicalprisoners remained in jail, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
