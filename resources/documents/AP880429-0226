One of the triggers to last year's uprisings at federal prisonsin Atlanta and Oakdale, La., was the fact that the government wastaking so long to place them in halfway houses once they weredeemed eligible for release, according to legal advocates for thedetainees. Federal officials said they were having trouble findinghalfway house space for the detainees.   From last June until the time the prison riots erupted inNovember, the Immigration and Naturalization Service had released106 Cuban inmates to halfway houses or to family sponsors. A totalof 1,047 have been placed since the disturbances.   INS has approved 2,224 Cuban detainees for release since lastJune, of whom 1,337 have been approved since the riots.   Parole has been denied to 1,193 Mariel Cubans and 845 of thedenials have been decided since the uprisings.   When the riots broke out, there were about 7,600 Cuban detaineesin various facilities.   The Justice Department also announced it plans to repatriate 14Mariel Cubans, the first group of detainees designated for returnto Cuba since the prison disturbances.   The 14, in federal custody since completing prison sentences forcrimes committed in the United States, have been notified that theINS intends to send them back, the Justice Department said.   Those in the group to be repatriated have been convicted ofcrimes including voluntary manslaughter, armed robbery, attemptedfirst-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted rape.   The repatriation process will include a review of their cases bya Justice Department review panel under an agreement which endedthe rioting at Atlanta and Oakdale.   Those facing repatriation will be given the opportunity tosubmit additional information on their behalf to the JusticeDepartment review panels, which specifically exclude immigrationofficers.</TEXT></DOC>
