I lived throughthem. I learned some things from them, and I'll use them, I hope, properly. SoI just start from here again. I've got a whole new life. It's going to behappy. I'm going to enjoy it, God willing.&quot;;   Although he harbors no sympathyfor his captors, he refuses to hate them, either.;   &quot;I don't hate anybody,&quot;he said. &quot;I'm a Christian and a Catholic, and I really believe that. And it'srequired of me that I forgive, no matter how hard that may be. And I'mdetermined to do that.&quot;;   Since his release Wednesday as the last U.S.hostage in Lebanon, Anderson has reveled in the small miracles of his freedom,like jogging in the fresh morning air and, though it is winter, marveling atthe greenness of grass.;   Appearing pale and wearing a Buffalo Bills footballteam sweat shirt, the 44-year-old Associated Press reporter faced the pressand endured being the news himself with a dry wit familiar to his friends anda tenderness new to even his family.;   His sister, Peggy Say, clasped hishand tightly and held him as he wept tears of gratitude for her relentlesscampaign to win his freedom and the wellspring of public support itgenerated.;   &quot;This is not the same Terry,&quot; Say said, &quot;and it's one I like awhole lot better.&quot;;   Anderson quietly recalled how hungrily he drank in thebeauty of his first hours of freedom.;   &quot;I remember when I was driving in thecar from where I was released to Damascus,&quot; he said. &quot;The sky cleared . . .and I was peering out the windshield . . . looking at the stars -- the firsttime I had seen stars in so long. And it was beautiful.&quot;;   For 2,455 days, helived without a sky, without stars or sunlight. He was moved &quot;15 or 20&quot; timesto blacked-out rooms or cells that were sometimes no more thansix-feet-square. He used water jugs as barbells and, when the chains were tooshort to move, tensed his muscles in isometric exercises.;   &quot;There were somepretty bad times,&quot; he said, alluding to beatings in his early years ofcaptivity, when other former hostages said Anderson at one point grew sofrustrated that he banged his head against the wall until blood ran.;   &quot;Oneof the first things I got, a few months after I got there, was a Bible, andthat helped,&quot; he said. &quot;My faith kept me from giving up, from giving in todespair, giving up on hope.&quot;;   His devout Catholicism also provided livelyfodder for debate with fellow hostage Thomas Sutherland, who has said he losthis faith in God during his captivity and spent hours arguing passionatelyabout it with Anderson.;   Anderson spoke at length about the nine otherWesterners who were imprisoned with -- and sometimes chained to -- him atpoints over the years. There would be friction, he acknowledged, but the men'sdevotion to each other became as important as the fresh air they could notbreathe and the stars they could not see.;   &quot;These men all gave something tome, helped me,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope they got something in return.&quot;;   &quot;I neededthem,&quot; he said of his fellow prisoners. &quot;I needed their minds. I needed whatthey knew. I needed them to keep my mind going.&quot;;   He said the hostages&quot;learned from each other everything we could possibly teach. And we exploredeach other's minds. We talked. It wasn't always easy. . . . And I think thoseof us who were together in the room came through pretty well, mentally,because we had each other.&quot;;   The low point, he said, occurred duringChristmas 1986, when hostages were held in solitary confinement and couldcommunicate with each other only by using sign language.;   &quot;I taught it tothem,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;We talked for hours and hours across the way,&quot; untilChristmas Day, when he dropped his glasses and broke them. &quot;As most of youknow, my eyes are very bad. I couldn't see. That was a bad day,&quot; he said.;  Anderson said he briefly was confined in the same room as William Buckley, theCIA station chief in Beirut, who died in captivity, apparently under torture.He said they were not allowed to talk to each other.;   Anderson said hebelieved Buckley died of a &quot;severe sickness.&quot;;   He defended Say againstcriticism that her campaign on his behalf had built up his importance and thusensured that he would be the last hostage released.;   &quot;I don't think it's acharge anybody needs to pay any attention to,&quot; he said. Her activity and thoseof others, he said, had not &quot;lengthened my captivity by one day.&quot;;   &quot;Therewere a lot of times when Peg's activity -- her voice, your voices -- kept usalive,&quot; he said.;   Anderson also said it was &quot;absolutely right&quot; of the Bushadministration not to negotiate with his captors, although he joked that inthe first months after his capture, he wouldn't have cared if &quot;he'd have giventhem an H-bomb just to get me out of that damn place.&quot;;   &quot;You can't negotiatewith hostage-takers. You can't give them anything. I'm delighted that we'reall out without any such price being paid, with an end result that everybodycan be satisfied with and proud of,&quot; he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Wiesbaden, Germany  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911207  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,039  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, December 7, 199100342067,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
