The results were to be used for modernisingthe heat supply plant. There is a report on the results of renewing theseheating plants and on the results in the first period of measurement.The conclusion was that the renewal of old heating plants led to theexpected energy saving by improving the annual efficiency; the NO/subx/ emission was lowered by replacing the boiler plant; SO/sub 2/ emissiondepended on the sulfur content of the heating oil, which varied greatly;the reduction in CO depended largely on regular maintenance and cleaningof the heating plant and on placing it in rooms as free of dust as possible.(HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
