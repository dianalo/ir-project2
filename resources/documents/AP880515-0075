Ten people were taken to hospitals, six with gunshot wounds andfour suffering from shock, according to police.   An anonymous telephone caller told the British BroadcastingCorp. that the attack on the tavern patronized by Roman Catholicswas carried out by the Protestant Action Force.   But a spokesman at BBC's Belfast office said the caller did notgive a recognized code used by the extremist Protestant ActionForce and the assertion could not be confirmed.   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed andpredominantly Catholic Irish Republican Army, blamed the attack onProtestant militants.   The Avenue Bar on Union Street was preparing to close at 2:30p.m. when the gunmen rang the bell and were admitted through theelectronically operated door, police said.   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there wereabout 20 people in the bar when the gunmen entered and appeared tobe looking for someone.   ``A guy came in and took his time looking around and thenstarted shooting,'' one witness said. ``Then the other one came inbehind him and started shooting at people. It was justindiscriminate; people were trying to dive for cover but they hadno chance.''   Police said two people died at the scene and the third waspronounced dead on arrival at a hospital. Moments after theshooting, three priests arrived to administer last rites to thedead.   The gunmen had hijacked a taxi in the Protestant Shankill Roadarea just before the attack and afterward drove off in thedirection of Shankill Road.   Police and troops rushed into the area around the pub and set uproadblocks. An army helicopter hovered above.   Local people said the victims were from Unity Flats, Ballymurphyand North Queen Street, all Catholic districts.   The attack, the first of its kind in years in Belfast, fueledfears of reprisals in the sectarian warfare that has ravaged thispredominantly Protestant British province.   Tom King, Britain's secreatry for Northern Ireland, called thekillings a ``revolting outrage.'' Sinn Fein President Gerry Adamssaid the attack was ``an attempt at mass murder.''   Both men appealed for calm.   ``There is no place in a civilized society for people asdepraved as these killers and that holds true for anybody who hasever raised a gun in Northern Ireland in pursuit of sectarian orpolitical ends,'' King said.   ``One thing Northern Ireland does not need now is talk ofretaliation and revenge. Good sense and restraint are what isneeded.''   Adams said, ``The area is very tense and local people are veryangry. I appeal for calm and discipline.''   The Protestant Action Force is an offshoot of the UlsterVolunteer Force. Both organizations are illegal.   The IRA is fighting to unite Northern Ireland, where Protestantsoutnumber Catholics 3-2, with the overwhelmingly Catholic Republicof Ireland.</TEXT></DOC>
