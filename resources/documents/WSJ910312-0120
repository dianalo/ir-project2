For all the well-deserved attention that U.S. exports aregetting these days, they weren't enough to keep the U.S. fromsliding into recession and they won't be enough to pull itout.</LP><TEXT>   Even in industries most successful at the export game,foreign demand is proving inadequate to offset the downturnin demand at home. In fact, production actually declined lastyear in six of the 10 most export-intensive manufacturing andmining industries, according to an analysis done for The WallStreet Journal by DRI/McGraw Hill Inc., a Lexington, Mass.,consulting company.   &quot;Why wasn't the recession worse? Exports. Exports.Exports,&quot; says DRI economist Vivian Singer. &quot;But it wasn'tenough to compensate. It doesn't matter if an industry isexport-intensive or not. It depends largely how its domesticmarket is doing.&quot;   Exports are one of the few bright spots in the U.S.economy these days. Growth in exports accounted for nearlyall of last year's meager increase in the U.S. gross nationalproduct, the value of all goods and services produced.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifyingrecently before a congressional committee, said that exportsactually provided &quot;little impetus to manufacturing&quot; in themonths before the recession began last summer. But sinceSeptember, foreign demand has been growing again, and exports&quot;have cushioned the steep declines that have occurred asproduction has responded unusually promptly to the weaknessin the domestic economy,&quot; he said. The decline of the dollaron world currency markets over the past six months shouldhelp keep exports growing by making U.S. goods cheaper forforeigners.   The outlook for exports remains rosy, but growth inexports of manufactured goods can't match the torrid pace ofthe past several years. In a recent survey, 68% of thedirectors of the National Association of Manufacturers saidexports will increase &quot;more slowly than in recent years.&quot;Only 26% said exports will continue to grow &quot;rapidly.&quot;   Exports of goods and services accounted for only 13% ofthe nation's $5.5 trillion GNP. In a small country such asthe Netherlands, where exports account for about half of allproduction, they can make or break a recession. &quot;The oppositeis true for most American industries because their domesticmarket is so overwhelmingly large,&quot; says Walter Joelson,chief economist at General Electric Co.   &quot;Take our major appliances, Mr. Joelson says. &quot;Exports arevery significant in total dollar volume, but in terms of thetotal major appliance business that we have, exports aremaybe 5% or 6%.&quot; GE's appliance business reported world-widerevenue of $5.7 billion last year.   Few industries are as dependent on exports as theconstruction- and mining-equipment business. DRI figures thatmore than 30% of its production was exported in the last halfof the 1980s and predicts that exports will account for 40%of its output this year. The industry's exports, adjusted forprice changes, grew by 13.5% last year, DRI estimates.   Yet the industry's total output fell by 1.8%, DRI says.Why? Demand for construction equipment dried up as the realestate recession spread across the country.   For some big makers of construction equipment, even theexport business turned out to be a bit disappointing lastyear. Caterpillar Inc., for instance, says it shipped 3%fewer machines world-wide in 1990 than the year before. Notonly did shipments to U.S. customers fall, but, to a lesserdegree, shipments abroad fell, too, the company says.   Economic woes in Brazil and recessions in the UnitedKingdom, Canada and some other important foreign markets areto blame. After taking price increases into account,Caterpillar's sales in the U.S. fell 2% while sales abroadgrew 6%.   At Ingersoll-Rand Co., foreign sales grew enough in thesecond half of last year to offset the decline in themachinery maker's domestic sales, but Vice President ThomasMcBride says that probably won't continue in the first halfof 1991.   Foreign sales don't necessarily mean U.S. exports, Mr.McBride cautions. Ingersoll's foreign business has beengrowing, but it also has been moving manufacturing offshore.Exports accounted for about 15% of Ingersoll's business lastyear, down from 22% a decade ago.   According to DRI, output of the computer industry,adjusted to remove price changes, grew 14.1%, faster than anyof the other 58 industries analyzed. Exports were a majorfactor. &quot;Keep in mind that the industry will see far less ofan increase in total dollar sales,&quot; Ms. Singer of DRI notes.As officially measured, prices for computers fallconsiderably every year when adjusted for the increased powerof the machines; as a result, economists figure theindustry's physical output of computing power grew more thanits reported sales.   Tobacco companies, increasingly looking abroad tocompensate for the waning appeal of cigarettes in the U.S.,also managed to increase exports sufficiently to offset adecrease in domestic demand.   ---                  Exports Aren't Enough                                                                                                          How the 10 most successful manufacturing and miningexporters fared                                                                                                                                     EXPORTS AS   EXPORTS    OUTPUT                             % OF OUTPUT    GROWTH    GROWTH INDUSTRY                   1985-89 AVG.     1990*     1990*                                                                                                        Computers, office equip.        32.5%       17.4%     14.1% Iron ore mining                 31.2         1.2     - 1.1 Construction mining equip.      30.2        13.5     - 1.8 Aircraft, parts                 28.2        12.4       3.9 Electronic components           24.0        11.5     - 0.4 Special ind. machinery          23.7        12.3       0.8 Engines and turbines            20.7         7.9     - 0.8 Leather tanning, finishing      18.1         7.0     - 8.3 Misc. electrical equip.         17.7         8.5     - 0.4 Tobacco products                15.4         9.3       0.9                                                                                                        *Dollar volume adjusted for price changes Source: DRI/McGraw Hill Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
