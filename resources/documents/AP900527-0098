The refusal of three provinces to support the agreement hasthrown the federal government into a crisis and provoked new fearsof succession efforts by Quebec.   Emerging from one of the meetings, Newfoundland Premier ClydeWells said: ``The differences are substantial and serious andresolution will not be easy.''   Mulroney commented: ``Obviously, we have serious problems.''   Mulroney is hoping to salvage what is known as the Meech Lakeagreement before its June 23 deadline.   Quebec refused to sign Canada's 1982 constitution. To win itssupport, Mulroney and all 10 premiers signed a five-point amendmentat Meech Lake, near Ottawa, in 1987, and set a three-year deadlinefor ratification by the provincial legislatures.   But the governments changed in three provinces _ Newfoundland,Manitoba and New Brunswick _ and the new premiers have refused toback the amendment.   The Meech Lake accord would define Quebec as a ``distinctsociety'' from the rest of Canada as a way to protect its Frenchlanguage and culture.</TEXT></DOC>
