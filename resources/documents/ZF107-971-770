 It's very hard to discreetlyprioritize calls, particularly when you're already on the phone.andP;  Say you'rehandling an important telephone call, but at the same time your most valuedcustomer is on another line.andP;  Do you take a chance on missing that secondcall?andP;  This is when the Direct-Line series from Amtel (Milwaukee, WI) can bea big help.andM;The products communicate through the AC power lines, so installation ismerely a case of plugging the units into an outlet.andP;  This also makes theunits portable, so you can carry them from your desk to a conference room forinstance.andP;  The keyboard model allows anyone, without interrupting a call, tonotify you of who's calling and why.andP;  You can do &quot;silent&quot; paging throughoutthe office, for instance.andP;  It also stores and displays messages.andM;There is also a panel unit for those of us who don't type.andP;  It has 30 commandphrases that you use to interact with a keyboard unit operator, all of whichcan be modified to say what you want.andM;All messages are displayed on a row of green LEDs.andP;  If you don't like thatarrangement, then there is a thermal printer that can be attached to eitherthe panel or keyboard units.andP;  It will put out a hard copy of all messagesthat are put into the Direct-Line system if you want it to.andP;  The days of thepink slip are numbered!andM;Wicom Walk-N-TalkandM;HeadsetandM;Anybody who has to spend more than half a hour a day on the phone shouldcheck out at least one type of headset.andP;  Why?andP;  Well, if you haven't heard italready, headsets do something very important for people in the businessworld.andP;  A headset leaves both hands free to do all sorts of things, be ittyping notes (just as we do when we conduct interviews) or digging upimportant bits of paper from your desk, without leaving you with agonizingneck- and backaches from cradling the receiver all day.andM;There is also a great diversity in headset design now, as there are a bunchof companies that make really good products and most of them have differentideas about what makes a headset work ergonomically.andP;  Folks like ACS, RacalAcoustics, Plantronics, Starkey, GN Netcom, Danavox, Audiosears and Nadyspring to mind.andM;But lots of folks don't like headsets because they have to move away fromtheir desks and don't like the fact that they either have to extractthemselves from their headsets before doing so, or pull the cord out fromtheir phones.andP;  This also means that you have to reconnect yourself if youwant to use the headset again upon returning, unless of course, you have aforty foot phone cord (as TELECONNECT's receptionist Marybeth does, and shehates every inch of it).andM;But take heart, for Wicom (Canoga Park, CA) has an alternative.andP;  TheirWalk-N-Talk headset is cordless.andP;  Yep, no more cords to worry about.andP;  Theunit consists of an binaural headband headset and a lightweight dialing unitthat you clip to your waist.andP;  It has a 500 to 1,000 foot range (depending onyour location) from the base unit that you mount by your phone on your desk.andM;There is a base-to-remote paging function (so when you're roving about folkscan find you easily), last number redial, flash hook button, non-slip keypad,a mute button and 256 security channels so you don't pick up CB broadcasts.andO;And, seeing as it does come from California, you can get your headset with anFM radio in it as well!andP;  The only thing that limits you is the charge on thebatteries for the hip pack, so happy trekking!andM;Suncoast Computerfone IIIandM;Suncoast System's (Pensacola, FL) Computerfone is a commercial quality,two-way telephone-to-computer voice digitizer and phone control product.andO;What does that mean?andP;  Well, the Computerfone is able to store and transferincoming speech to a digital format, dial phone numbers, answer incomingcalls and convert incoming tones to standard ASCII characters (so yourcomputer can digest them).andM;You could use your Computerfone for telephone ordering or unattendedappointment making if you wanted to.andP;  It could also be used as a remotecontrol for other devices, or as a monitor station for system malfunctions.andO;Hell's bells, you could even use it for wake-up calls on a hotel PBX if youreally wanted to!andM;For $695, you get a unit about the size of a modem that can do lots ofdifferent things, some of which include operator notification, externalswitch recognition and remote contact closing.andM;It's a standalone device that can operate with virtually any type ofoperating system or computer using the industry standard RS-23/ASCIIprotocol.andP;  Intelligent little thing ain't it?andP;  So what does the Computerfonemean?andP;  It means that users can now communicate with a computer through anystandard telephone, receive a voice response, store messages and executecommands.andP;  And there you have it.andM;Viking PathFinderandM;The PathFinder from Viking Electronics (Hudson, WI) is one of the nicestline-switching devices around.andP;  Ever since it became de rigueur to have a faxmachine, the problem has been whether to put up with the cost of a dedicatedline or not.andP;  If you think not, then you need some sort of clever box thatwill distinguish incoming voice and fax calls and send them to theappropriate device.andM;As with most automatic routing switches, the PathFinder will automaticallyanswer each call and then, by checking for incoming data signals, route thecall.andM;It works for both touchtone and pulse phones.andP;  What makes it special is theextra ports that allow you to share one line among four data/voice devices,such as modems and point-of-sale terminals as well as the ubiquitoustelephone and fax machine.andM;The other nice thing about this neat peripheral is that you can program ityourself to do whatever you want it to do by using any sort of phone.andP;  Italso has a really neat way of avoiding junk fax through security codes, so ofcourse we love this product!andM;You specify which ports the security feature covers and then sit back andrelax.andP;  With the codes in place, the caller has five seconds to input anumber code on a touchtone phone after the call is answered by thePathFinder.andP;  If he doesn't put in the right code the call is sent to adefault line (e.g.andP;  a phone) or you can set up the device to cut off the calltotally.andP;  DEATH TO JUNK FAX FOREVER!andM;Viziflex SeelsandM;Advert-A-SeelandM;Why is it that a lot of phones now have places where you can scribble downimportant phone numbers on them?andP;  Because then you don't have to go lookingfor the numbers, right?andP;  OK, who's got a phone that doesn't have a space fornumbers on it?andP;  Before anybody yells out &quot;me,&quot; take a look at this add-onfrom Viziflex Seels (Hackensack, NJ).andM;The Advert-A-Seel is a telephone keypad cover made out of flexible plastic.andO;It comes in a variety of models to suit various types of telephones.andP;  Thecover is form-fitting and is impervious to dust, water, coffee or anythingelse you throw at it (this alone will appeal to anyone who has ever actuallyhad to clean a telephone).andM;But what makes the Advert-A-Seel interesting is that you can have materialprinted onto the cover.andP;  This could be a series of telephone numbers (perhapsthe speed dial codes for your business and what they correspond to),instructions or, perhaps most interesting of all, company advertising thatsits right on the telephone whilst protecting the keypad.andP;  The covers don'tinterfere with the operation of the telephone either.andP;  We reckon that itwould be perfect for courtesy phones or lobby sets, especially at a price ofbetween $1 and $4 dollars a piece.andM;Fax Care Jr.andM;So, just how are you supposed to clean a fax machine?andP;  After all, they getdirty too, don't they?andP;  There are two ways to go about it: either call arepair man or do it yourself.andP;  If you're going to do it yourself (and ifyou're not made of moola then we strongly suggest you do), then you'd betterget something a lot like the Fax Care Jr.andP;  cleaning kit from Fax Care Company(Deerfield, IL).andM;The kit comes with a cleaning wand with replacement cleaning pads to cleanthe document and thermal feed rollers.andP;  It also includes three print headcleaning swabs, three cabinet cleaner wipes and a wee bottle of cleaningsolution.andP;  Once you've got it then there's no stopping you from wreakinghavoc upon fax filth.andM;The kit comes in a reusable package and all the constituent items can bepurchased separately for refills.andP;  All of this will cost you $19.95, butthink of the peace of mind you'll have!andM;There are lots of times when a lot of us wish that we were in some quieterplace, especially for phone calls.andP;  Some offices (such as ours) have so muchwhite noise that sometimes calls become littered with &quot;what?&quot; or &quot;could yourepeat that?&quot;andP;  When this is the case, it's time to check out a NoiseCensorhandset from Plantronics/Walker (Ringgold, GA).andM;The handsets work in a mix and match type of arrangement.andP;  They combinenoise-cancelling technology with a directional mic-to-phone which has aspecial voice-switching circuit.andP;  What does this mean?andP;  Well, backgroundnoise is dramatically reduced and annoying &quot;sidetones&quot; are taken care of aswell.andM;Plantronics/Walker makes a range of handsets for various phone models -- bothcarbon and electronic -- in either K or G styles.andP;  The amplified handsetcomes with a neat volume control on its neck that is really useful.andP;  Theyalso manufacture screw-on noise cancelling transmitters that you can place onyour existing handset.andP;  The handsets are around $60 each and the transmittercosts $30.andM;Eltrex Speakeasy IIandM;The SpeakEasy II is a digital pre-announcer.andP;  It helps to reduce the monotonyof inbound call-center work and will help operators to work longer periodsmore effectively without burning out.andM;You record a greeting message onto the SpeakEasy.andP;  It is digitally stored andcan be changed at any time.andP;  From that moment, whenever your phone rings, theSpeakEasy will answer and play the message to the caller before automaticallypassing control of the call to you.andP;  There is also a manual override switch.andM;The device from the friendly folks at Eltrex (Amherst, NH) is about the sizeof a paperback book and sits on your desk connected to your phone.andP;  Yourecord your message by employing your handset or headset.andP;  The device boastsboth modular and two-prong jacks for standard or heavy duty usage and issuperbly crafted with solid state electronics and a surge protector builtright in.andP;  The entire attractive package is encased in steel and weighs abouta pound.andM;Standard message length is five seconds, but longer times are available.andP;  Youcan review the message at any time to check its quality by pressing a button.andO;It is compatible with all major business telephone systems worldwide andcosts $750 per unit.andM;Omnivoice Messenger PlusandM;So, what sort of automated attendant does TELECONNECT like?andP;  Well, if you cancombine it with a complete voice-processing system like Omnivoice's (Warren,OH) Messenger Plus then you're definitely on the right track.andP;  It'scompatible with most PBX, Centrex or hybrid systems that interface to a 2500telephone set and allow call transfer capability.andM;The self-contained unit accommodates four trunks and holds 5.2 hours of voicemessages.andP;  All calls can be answered with a personalized greeting.andP;  TheMessenger Plus can help you screen calls as well -- it takes a recording of acaller's name and allows the called party to decide whether to accept orrefuse a call, the latter case resulting in the device switching the call toa voice mailbox.andM;It has built-in statistical tracking of all extensions that makes callmanagement easier.andP;  It also has a neat feature called auto message delivery.andO;The unit will call mailbox users at a programmed number at a specified timeto deliver any messages.andP;  It also has audiotex, paging, a bulletin boardcapability and message alert.andP;  The other nice thing about the Messenger Plusis that you can tailor its features to suit your business.andM;TEAC CommunicationsandM;RecordersandM;Did you know that on one 160-minute VHS video cassette you can fit over 12hours worth of voice communications from 20 different channels?andP;  Well TEACAmerica (Montebello, CA) certainly does.andP;  They make a whole bunch of voicerecorders that utilize VHS tape.andM;What could you use one of these machines for?andP;  Well, if you're a brokeragefirm, a mail-order company or a law firm, you probably already record allphone conversations for later reference.andP;  You probably also use either veryexpensive digital equipment that has limited recording space, or analogequipment that has relatively poor quality.andP;  VHS tapes are cheap, universallyaccessible and can also be copyprotected by removing a small plastic tab.andO;The CR-120 recorder from TEAC has two tape decks that enables you to record20 channels for a 24 hour period (used in serial operation) or 40 channelsfor 12 hours at a time (parallel operation).andM;All TEAC models have time-code recording as a standard feature, enabling aquick serch for specific conversations and fast retrieval of information.andO;You can search manually using the tape controls whilst listening to the audiosignal, or instruct the recorder to automatically find a specific time code.andO;The CR-120 has warning lights to notify the operator of the approach of theend of a tape and also for trouble shooting.andM;Level indicators are provided for each channel and monitor input/outputlevels, with a speaker monitor that allows each channel to be switched on andoff independently.andP;  A monitor output is also standard.andP;  It allows dubbing ofone tape to an external recorder.andM;DynaMetric Cut-OffandM;ModuleandM;If you're an industrial spy, then you really like telephones, particularlyhandsets.andP;  I bet that not too many of you readers knew that the microphone inyour handset remains on all the time, even when it's on-hook!andP;  Hackerscertainly do.andM;This means that anyone with the know-how and the inclination can listen intoyour private conversations, perhaps even important and confidentialdiscussions, could be recorded in addition to your actual phone calls if youhave a VOX (voice activated) or central recorder/logger.andM;So, now that I've got your attention, what's the solution?andP;  You could do alot worse than talking to DynaMetrics out in Monrovia, CA.andP;  Their COM-205cut-off module plugs into your handset and phone cord and cuts the audiocompletely when the handset is returned to its cradle by a series of multiplegravity switches.andM;Telephone systems with remote diagnostic capabilities are also at risk,because computer hackers are sneaky SOBs and can go through that way andlisten into all that goes on.andP;  Again, the COM-205 is the solution.andP;  The unitalso acts as a great little mut switch.andM;If your phone doesn't have hold on it then you can rotate the handsetmouthpiece up to eye level from your mouth.andP;  This throws the gravity switchesand the line goes dead without terminating the call.andP;  Turn the mouthpieceback down to your mouth and the line reopens, the guy at the other end thinksthat he's been put on hold.andP;  The COM-205 retails at $49.95 and if you'reconcerned about security, that's a small price to pay for peace of mind.andM;Dugdale In-StepandM;One of the most infuriating things about trying to go through voicemail-messages is that you don't have enough hands.andP;  You need one hand tooperate the mail machine, then if you want to take any memos or make notesyou have to write them on paper and then type them into a computerfile...it's all very messy and bothersome.andM;A really neat system would allow you to keep both hands on your keyboard andstill operate voice mail.andP;  A really neat system like that would mean that youcould use your voice mail system for dictation purposes as well as a fancyanswring machine.andP;  A really neat system would impress us greatly.andP;  Wouldn'tyou know it, we've found a really neat add-on to a heck of a lot of voicemail systems that make all of the things that we want to do possible.andM;The In-Step from Dugdale Communications (Indianapolis, IN) is most definitelya really neat system.andP;  It consists of two units, a base that you mount yourtelephone onto and a foot pedal (that's the really neat bit).andP;  The base panelhas an LCD display and three program keys that, together, let you program,step by step, just what you want the pedals to do.andM;At any one time, the foot pedals can perform six different functions.andP;  Someof these include logging off and on, scrolling through messages and backingup through messages that you're listening to.andP;  What it does is free both yourhands and that's precious indeed.andP;  The In-Step is compatible with any voicemail system that uses touchtones for operation and can be connected to any2500 standard telephone.andM;Telautograph Omnifax PPIandM;In a world caught up in the throes of &quot;Faxation,&quot; the latest craze is to havea plain paper fax machine.andP;  Why?andP;  Because you don't need slimy thermal paperthat costs heaps and fades to boot.andP;  But (and there's always a &quot;but&quot; when itcomes to technology) plain paper fax machnes cost a real bomb.andP;  So what isthe Telautograph Omnifax PPI?andP;  Could it be a solution to the plain paper faxdilemman?andP;  Would it be in this section if it wasn't?andM;Yep, the Omnifax is a plain-paper interface module which recives your faxtransmissions in lieu of a complete fax machine and prints out on a HewlettPackard LaserJet II printer or something similar.andP;  It's a standalone unit, soit hooks up directly to your phone lines and the printer's parallel port.andO;So, in fact, the Omnifax PPI is an alternative to standard fax machines and,at a price of $1,395, a pretty cost-effective one as well.andM;It comes with a megabyte of internal memory and works best if the printerthat you attach it to has at least the same degree of storage.andP;  That amountof memory means that the Omnifax can store and buffer up to 60 pages ofincoming stuff.andP;  Once you tell it to print out, the system will print abouttwo pages a minute, no doubt limited more by the laser printer than the PPI.andM;But, I hear you all shriek, what about those of us who've already bought athermal fax machine?andP;  Do we just throw it away?andP;  Oh no, not so.andP;  If you'rereally smart then you'll set up the Omnifax PPI to receive all of your faxsand the thermal machine as an additional sending station.andP;  This reduces thatnew bugbear of being tied up in the line for the fax machine, while you stillget all of your faxs on wonderful plain old paper.andM;TRW Fax EncryptorandM;The second oldest profession in the world has been taking advantage of thefaxplosion phenomenon for long enough.andP;  It's been very easy for anyone withthe inclination to tap into fax lines and pick up information that theyshouldn't have their grubby little paws on.andP;  But now it's very, verydifferent.andM;TRW, best known as a longtime supplier of encryption equipment to the USgovernment, manufactures the Fax Encryptor which is compatible with all GroupIII fax machines.andP;  The unit utilizes a highly complex mathematical codingalgorithm that was developed especially for this application.andP;  The only catchis that you need two units to become secured and remain intelligible toanyone else out there in faxland.andM;You place units between the outside phoe lines and both the sending and thereceiving faxs.andP;  Then you're set.andP;  Each Encryptor has a unique identityfeature that is accessed before every transmission.andP;  This process checks outthe ID of the receiving unit.andP;  If the sending Encryptor can't verify therecipient then the fax isn't sent.andM;Unit IDs are installed in the factory and no two are alike.andP;  You can store upto 100 IDs of receiving machines in your unit's directory.andP;  If someone triesto get inside your Encryptor and steal some codes, the memory and ID list areautomatically erased and the unit's tamper alarm goes off.andP;  This freezes upthe machine so effectively that you have to return it to the factory to getit reset.andM;So if you're into security, check out TRW at 805-544-2438.andP;  If you'reinterested in the Fax Encryptor, you might as well know that the list priceis $1,595 per unit.andM;Walker FaxXchange IPSandM;As everyone knows, fax has gone berserk.andP;  Company networks are becominglarger and larger as departments obtain more machines.andP;  Add to that the risein computer-mounted fax boards and things can get a little out of hand.andP;  Andthat's where the Walker FaxXchange IPS (Integrated Processing System) stepsin.andM;The FaxXchange isn't a fax.andP;  It's a store and forward fax networking unit,switching, controlling, batching, delaying and converting facsimile.andP;  Itallows you to send fax transmissions from any sort of terminal, which is bigtime stuff, from a laptop to a PC to a mainframe, it'll even convertcharacter information from a host computer to fax.andM;It's not a bad idea to think of it as a smart fax PBX.andP;  It doesn't make dumbphones smart, but it coordinates your (ever growing) fax network.andP;  TheFaxXchange can also help managers with cost allocation and network managementfor fax.andP;  It's intelligent enough to study usage patterns of direct fax linesand route transmissions in the most cost effective way.andP;  The IPS is afront-end controller for the FaxXchange, taking a reliable product and givingit a big boost of user-friendliness.andM;The IPS will give a FaxXchange user lots of additional features, such asinteractive voice interface, security controls, unattended systemadministration and other things such as host controlled fax traffic routingin a network.andP;  If you have a lot of users that you want to provide variedaccess to, or if you want to try and control your increasing plethora of faxmachines, then you really want to check out the FaxXchange system.andM;Pika Line-Status IndicatorandM;Pika Technologies are from Canada and they built their Busy Lamp Fieldindicator for one purpose only -- to work behind a Mitel PBX.andP;  The BLF-28 hasdeveloped a few other uses, however, and to see why let's see how it works.andM;The unit is seen by the switch as a pair, so in fact the PBX thinks the unitis a Superset 4.andP;  Each lamp is hence programmed as a line appearance.andP;  Thisis nice, because it makes programming easy to do and the unit shows the usersystem such things as line idle, busy, on hold or ringing.andP;  So what do youexpect of a machine that is supposed to provide line appearances and callcoverage in either 14 or 28 line increments?andM;But here's the neat thing if you're a small business.andP;  When you use the BLFin conjunction with a Superset 4, all of a sudden you have a nice andinexpensive way of setting up a sub-attendant station, one that is quite bigenough to handle a few extensions without having to purchase a separateoperator console.andM;It's easy to install.andP;  The initial hookup requires running a two-pair modularcord from the unit to a wall jack, and it requires no external power.andP;  Youalso don't have to make any modifications to the Mitel switch.andP;  It also looksgood and, at a retail price of $599, it's a good value, considering all thatit does.andP;  You can reach Pika at 613-726-1908.andM;Tripp Lite FaxandM;Surge SuppressorandM;One of the things that folks forget most when they get new equipment is thatelectricity can be nasty stuff and can fry most anything, be it your PBX,your computers, or your beloved fax machine.andP;  So take a hint and think aboutprotection (see last month for all sorts of power protection goodies).andM;Tripp Lite's out of Chicago and they make lots of power protection stuff.andO;Their SMP Fax Protector combines single-outlet AC surge suppression andphone-line surge protection in a single unit that you plug into your ACoutlet.andP;  For $49.95 you get your fax machine and data transmissions guardedby a single spike and surge filter arrangement on the AC line.andP;  SeparateRJ-11 input and output receptacles mind against telephone-line surges aswell.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
