<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-68-0173 </DOCNO><TEXT>The effect of the double layer structure is very seldom considered inthe electrochemical measurements of corrosion rates. Polarization equationsof corroding metals can be corrected for the effect of the double layerusing the classical Frumkin correction of electrode kinetics. This correctedpolarization equation can be used to generate synthetic data which, inturn, permit the calculation of the error caused by the neglect of thedouble layer effect in the electrochemical corrosion rate determinations.While the error depends on many parameters, the two dominating factorsare the concentration of the solution and the potential of the corrodingmetal with respect to the potential of zero change (pzc). The error willbe negligible (less than ten percent) if the solution concentration isat least 0.1 molar or the corrosion potential is at least {+-}0.25 Vfrom the pzc. The error can be very large, many hundreds or thousandsof percents, unless at least one of the above conditions is met, andthe appearance of the polarization curves will have no clear indicationof the unreliability of the measurement. Under these conditions, theelectrochemical measurements should be supplemented with other typesof corrosion rate determinations, or a correction can be made if thedouble layer parameters are known. 5 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
