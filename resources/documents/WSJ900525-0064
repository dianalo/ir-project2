Treasurer Is Said   To Plan to Quit   ---   Zuckerman Tells Associates   He Expects to Leave,   But Timing Is Unclear   ----   By Melinda Grenier Guiles   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/25/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A3</SO><CO>   C WNEWS</CO><LP>   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Frederick W. Zuckerman, ChryslerCorp.'s treasurer and day-to-day link with the investmentcommunity, is preparing to quit the No. 3 U.S. auto maker.   Persons familiar with his plans say that Mr. Zuckerman, 56years old, has told them he expects to leave. But thesepersons add that Mr. Zuckerman hasn't specified where he'sgoing or the timing of his move. One co-worker said hisdeparture is probably more than a month away, however.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Zuckerman had &quot;no comment&quot; about any move when reachedby telephone in his office yesterday. &quot;We don't confirm ordeny rumors like that,&quot; he said.   Last week, Michael N. Hammes, also a vice president,resigned as head of Chrysler's international operations totake the top position at Black andamp; Decker Corp.'s corepower-tools division. The departures of the two men aren'tbelieved to be related, but it couldn't be determined why Mr.Zuckerman decided to leave.   Mr. Zuckerman joined Chrysler in 1979 during the darkestof the auto maker's dark days. He acted as Chrysler's liaisonwith the federal board that monitored Chryler's loanguarantees. He also served as a financial adviser duringlabor negotiations.   He is currently responsible for Chrysler's pension fundsand for its relations with commercial banks. He recentlyoversaw the $1 billion bond offering related to Chrysler'ssale-leaseback deal for its Auburn Hills, Mich., technologycenter.   The voluble native New Yorker is popular among investmentbankers and the press because of his financial acumen andcandor. That candor has, however, sometimes causedconsternation among his superiors at Chrysler.   Just days after the stock market crash in 1987, he toldthe Dow Jones News Service he was cutting the Chryslerpension fund's stock and bond portfolio because &quot;the dollarwill go to hell. Therefore, interest rates will go to hell.&quot;   &quot;You ain't seen nothing yet,&quot; he added. &quot;I do not believeit is politically possible to do what the country has to doto reassure the world financial community that we will . . .run our fiscal affairs in a responsible manner.&quot;   Chrysler quickly put out a &quot;clarification,&quot; which quotedMr. Zuckerman as saying he &quot;was giving my personal opinion ofthe overall economic situation, and trying to wake up thepeople in Washington. Obviously there are good buys in themarket. I'm buying Chrysler {stock} today.&quot;   Another example came early last year, when Mr. Zuckermantold securities analysts in New York the company believed&quot;earnings in each quarter of 1989 will be greater than thosein each corresponding quarter of 1988,&quot; despite newincentives. The new-car market soured soon after, however,and Chrysler ended the year with its largest quarterly lossever after a $577 million one-time charge for shrinkingcompany operations.   Prior to joining Chrysler, Mr. Zuckerman spent 12 years infinancial management at International Business Machines Corp.Prior to that, he spent almost eight years at Ford Motor Co.   While at Ford, he worked with a number of his currentfellow Chrysler executives. Among them: Vice Chairman GeraldGreenwald, who once reported to Mr. Zuckerman as a financialplanner when Mr. Zuckerman was controller of the FordDivision's parts and service operations.   ---   James A.
