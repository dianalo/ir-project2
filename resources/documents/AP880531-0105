Gorbachev told PresidentReagan today it may be ``time to bang our fists on the table'' toprod negotiators working on a treaty halving strategic nuclear armsstockpiles. But it was clear that an agreement would not come atthis week's summit.   ``I'll do anything that works,'' Reagan said.   Officials in both delegations said the goal was to reach anagreement before Reagan leaves office next January. GennadyGerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that``unfortunately, there will be no more signings'' beyond minoragreements finalized today.   On their third day of talks, Reagan and Gorbachev met in theSoviet leader's Kremlin office, sitting beneath a portrait of KarlMarx. After their discussions, they took an unscheduled stroll onRed Square past the tomb of Lenin and shook hands with surprisedtourists. ``Wonderful,'' Reagan said of the square.   Reagan appeared tired and had difficulty following questionsfrom reporters. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reaganhad slept poorly and that everyone in the delegation was tired,despite a four-day rest stop in Helsinki.   Nancy Reagan, asked about her husband, said, ``He sleeps fine.''Fitzwater said Reagan was in good health and ``his stamina is justfine.''   At a meeting with Soviet students, Reagan was asked about hisimpression about Soviet dissidents and refuseniks with whom he met.Soviet newspapers described one of the dissidents as a collaboratorwith the Fascists during World War II. The president said he knewnothing about this allegation.   Reagan said Gorbachev ``has been most helpful and agreeableabout correcting'' the problems incurred by those groups. ``We havethe same type of thing happen in our country,'' Reagan said,blaming it on bureaucrats.   The Soviet leader expressed new hopes for completing a majorarms treaty, but it was not clear whether he was talking aboutgetting it done by summit's end _ or merely before Reagan`s termconcludes next January. Soviet and American officials have saidrepeatedly they do not expect a strategic arms pact (START) to beconcluded here.   During an encounter with reporters, Reagan was asked if he stillbelieved the Soviet Union was an ``evil empire,'' as he has calledit in the past.   Standing next to his host, Reagan said he no longer thought thatway. ``I was talking about another time, another era,'' thepresident said.   The leaders also watched and joined in the applause as Secretaryof State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze signed several secondary agreements, including a pairof arms accords. Under one such pact agreed to in Moscow, thesuperpowers will notify each other of the time, place and intendedtarget of intercontinental-range missiles tests.   Reagan, continuing his public relations offensive to promotefreedom and human rights in the Soviet Union, met over lunch at theHouse of Writers with artists, filmmakers and writers.   Talking to some of the Soviet Union's leading intellectuals, hediscussed how an actor could become president _ explaining thatboth artists and political leaders had to be able to grasp a visionand to put it into life.   ``By the way, I`ve found that Mr. Gorbachev has the ability tograsp and hold a vision and I respect him for that,'' Reagan said.</TEXT><TEXT>   Later, in an address prepared for delivery to students at MoscowState University, Reagan said the young people were living ``in oneof the most exciting, hopeful times in Soviet history'' when ``thefirst breath of freedom stirs the air.''   He said ``we are hopeful that the promise of reform will befulfilled.''   The president cautioned that ``progress is not fore-ordained.The key is freedom _ freedom of thought, freedom of information,freedom of communication.'' He cited steps in Singapore, SouthKorea and Taiwan, adding that the most exciting changes were inChina ``where one quarter of the world`s population is now gettingits first taste of economic freedom.''</TEXT><TEXT>   At the Kremlin meeting, Reagan appeared to dig in his heels onhis Strategic Defense Initiative missile defense plan, one of thekey obstacles to agreement on a strategic arms treaty. ``It's neverbeen a part of the negotiations,'' he said in response to aquestion.   Without addressing Star Wars, Gorbachev said he was confidentthere would be progress on arms issues.   ``And I'm sure that if the president makes good use of his timethat we have remaining, I'm sure that we will be able to preparethe treaty,'' Gorbachev said.   At that point, a reporter asked Reagan if he, too, thought atreaty could be concluded. ``Yes, I'm very pleased to hear whatthey're saying.'' Asked again if a treaty was possible, Gorbachevstepped in to answer, saying, ``If that question is to me, yes Ithink a START treaty is possible.''   The Soviet leader recalled that he and Reagan, at their firstsummit in Geneva in 1985, had reached an impasse at one point. Hesaid that at that point, ``the president said, `Well, let's stampour fists on the table.' `I said all right,' and by morningeverything was agreed, the Geneva negotiations were successfullycompleted.''   ``Maybe now it is again a time to bang our fists on the tableonce again,'' Gorbachev said.   Asked by a reporter if he agreed, Reagan said, ``I'll doanything that works.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
