Voters who made their choice in the race's final days wentstrongly for Bush, in part because of his superior campaignorganization, his ties to the Reagan administration and hisexperience in office, exit polls indicated Tuesday.   The result was a 9-point victory for the vice president, aftersome polls had shown him leading Dole just barely, by 4 points in aCBS News-New York Times poll and 2 points in an ABC News-WashingtonPost survey.   ``The voters of New Hampshire have a well-deserved reputation ofupsetting poll results, and tonight was a good example of that,''said NBC News pollster Laurily Epstein. ``People change theirminds, and you can't poll for that.''   An NBC News-Wall Street Journal exit poll found that 14 percentof the GOP voters in New Hampshire made up their minds on primaryday, with 36 percent going for Bush and 29 percent for Dole.Another 11 percent decided during the weekend, breaking 44 percentfor Bush to 31 percent for Dole.   ``It was the undecideds. The undecideds went for Bush,'' saidJohn Berrigan, a poll analyst for ABC News. A key reason: Bush'sidentification with President Reagan, who is very popular among NewHampshire Republicans.   ``The Reagan coattails were there,'' said Jerry Strom, an NBCNews poll consultant. ``People who like Reagan were going stronglyfor Bush.''   NBC's exit poll supported that contention. Three-quarters ofRepublicans said they wanted the nation to stay on the course setby Reagan; 88 percent of Bush's supporters held that view, comparedwith 66 percent of Dole's.   There were fewer Reagan backers in Iowa, and more of them wentfor Dole than for Bush, albeit narrowly, in the precinct caucusesFeb. 8. Dole won big there while Bush suffered a third-placeembarrassment.   Berrigan said New Hampshire's economic vitality could explainReagan's popularity in that state, and its benefit for Bush. ``Youmay have a kind of status quo phenomenon going on here, a beliefthat there may be a threat if I don't go with someone who'sfollowing the same line,'' he said.   Perhaps for similar reasons, a third of Republicans saidexperience was the chief factor in their vote, and 54 percent ofthem voted for Bush, to 37 percent for Dole, the CBS-Times pollsaid. Dole won among Republicans looking chiefly for a strongleader, with 48 percent to 21 percent for Bush, but that group madeup just 19 percent of the GOP total.   Another key for Bush was his extensive campaign organization inNew Hampshire. The CBS-Times poll found that 47 percent of Bush'sbackers said they had been asked to vote for him by someone in hisorganization, while just 26 percent of Dole's supporters reportedcontact by the Dole campaign.   ``I think the thing that won it for Bush was his organization,''said Warren Mitofsky, polling chief at CBS News.   While the polls did not anticipate the extent of Bush's victory,Mitofsky said they did identify trends in the race: Bush way aheadbefore the Iowa caucuses, dropping sharply after losing to Dole andPat Robertson in Iowa, then halting his slide and rebounding duringthe weekend.   Speaking on CBS, Bush credited his victory to a surge of supportin the last 48 hours. ``I learned from that, fight back. Fighton,'' he said. ``It's taught me a good lesson: Do not bediscouraged by the polling numbers.''   The exit poll results were less remarkable on the Democraticside, where Michael Dukakis won handily, as expected. ABC had himwinning all ideological groups and beating his opponents soundly inorganization.   The poll results also indicated Dukakis' backyard advantage. ABCsaid 55 percent of Democrats rated Dukakis above average asgovernor of neighboring Massachusetts, and 59 percent of them votedfor him. Moreover, the CBS-Times poll found that 20 percent of NewHampshire's Democratic voters moved there from Massachusetts, andfour in 10 of them went for Dukakis.   Rep. Richard Gephardt's second-place finish appeared to be aidedby his first-place showing in Iowa. Of the voters who made up theirminds after Iowa, 27 percent went to Gephardt, 26 percent toDukakis and 20 percent to Sen. Paul Simon, who finished second inIowa and third in New Hampshire.</TEXT></DOC>
