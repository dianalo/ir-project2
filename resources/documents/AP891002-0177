New tensions surfaced, however, over a surprise visit to Iran bytwo key Moslem militia chieftains, Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt andhis Shiite Moslem civil war ally, Nabih Berri.   Most of the 63 parliamentarians meeting here _ 33 Christians and30 Moslems _ interpreted the trip as an Iranian attempt toundermine the conference, under way since Saturday, conferencesources said.   Berri heads the Shiite Moslem Amal militia and Jumblatt commandsthe Progressive Socialist Party. Together, the two factionscomprise about 12,000 fighters.   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Berri as saying: ``Weare vehemently opposed to the plan submitted by the tripartite Arabcommittee to solve the crisis in Lebanon.''   The committee, composed of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria,has proposed a peace plan that includes a series of politicalreforms designed to end the Christian domination of government,Parliament, the army and the judiciary in Lebanon.   The conference sources said the parliamentarians on Monday weregoing over the proposed national reconciliation charter ``point bypoint.''   The charter would serve as an alternative to an unwrittennational covenant reached among the various sects in 1943, whenLebanon gained independence from France.   ``This plan does not conform with the wishes and aspirations ofthe Moslems. This plan ... will result in the division ofLebanon,'' Berri said.   Berri and Jumblatt are Syria's main allies. Their support andthat of their rival Lebanese Forces coalition of Christian militiasis essential for implementing any agreement that may be reached inTaif.   Despite political problems, a cease-fire called by the Arabmediators Sept. 22 to end six months of fierce artillery battlesbetween the Syrians and Christians was holding.   The Christians' demand that a timetable for the withdrawal ofthe Syrian army from Lebanon be workd out before political reformshampered progress during Saturday and Sunday.   But Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal,steered the deputies away from arguments, persuading them todiscuss instead the proposed political reforms.   Faisal is sitting in on the Parliament debates along with hisMoroccan and Algerian counterparts, Abdel-Latif al-Filali andBouallam Belsayeh.   The deputies also discussed how to disarm militia factions whosemilitary strength has eroded government authority.   The sources said several suggestions were being examined fordisbanding the militias, including attaching some of them tovarious military corps.   They said most deputies appeared to favor a timetable, phasingSyrian withdrawal from Moslem sectors of Beirut to the Bekaa Valleyin east Lebanon over two years while the country's constitutionalstructure, virtually dismantled by the war, is rebuilt.   But most of the Christian deputies, backed by some Moslemsallied with Iraq, Syria's rival in the Arab world, demanded animmediate Syrian withdrawal.   The Syrian army has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, controlling 70percent of the country.   The troops entered Lebanon in 1976, a year after the civil warbroke out, under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun, who is backed by Iraq, saysthe Syrians abrogated their peacekeeping mandate by openly sidingwith the Moslems.</TEXT></DOC>
