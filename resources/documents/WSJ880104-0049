No one admits to contriving this section, which could cause the economically ailing papers to close.    The Federal Communications Commission has been reviewing the First Amendment problems of its rule prohibiting ownership of daily newspapers and broadcast stations in the same market. Mr. Murdoch was hoping for permanent waivers for New York and Boston. A media foundation asked the FCC to abandon the rule because it was reducing media diversity by forcing closings.    Neither the House nor Senate spending bill mentioned the cross-ownership rule. Then, at a midnight budget conference on the two bills, Senator Hollings had a Senate Communications subcommittee staffer insert the killer provision. Other senators' staffers, UPI and Broadcasting magazine identify the source as Senator Kennedy, a favorite target for scorn by the conservative Herald.    This furtive operation stinks to Ouagadougou of a tyrant's way of shutting down critical newspapers. What we'd like to know is what other abominations await fiscal archaeologists as they pick through the rubble of this 1,000-page bill? </TEXT></DOC>
