Contrary to the controversy in the media, the Senate'svote on Judge Thomas's nomination is not a referendum onwhether &quot;self-reliance&quot; is better than &quot;affirmative action.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   It is not a vote on how well he conducted the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission when he was its chairman.The Senate already had the opportunity to vote on that -- andit confirmed his nomination for a second term.   It is not a vote on whether Clarence Thomas would be wherehe is today if he were not black. Neither Judge Thomas noranyone else selects his own color or the swirl ofcircumstances and influences that put him in one situationrather than another.   It is not even a vote on whether Clarence Thomas everbenefited from some of the policies he criticizes. Many of ushave benefited from being drafted and receiving G.I. Billbenefits as a result. Are we never to look at war, or thedraft, or the G.I. Bill from the standpoint of how the publicinterest is served or disserved? Are we forbidden to beanything other than narrowly personal when discussingnational issues?   The Senate is supposed to vote on whether Judge Thomas isqualified to be a justice of the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates. His critics do not seem to want to discuss thatquestion, or even to recognize that that is in fact thequestion before the Senate and the country. Obviously, theydo not feel they have much of a case if they argue on thosegrounds. Neither his record as a judge on the second highestcourt in the land nor his personal life gives them anythingthey can use against him.   Why then the opposition to Judge Thomas in the firstplace? Do the pillars of the civil-rights establishmentbelieve that defeating Clarence Thomas will get them anothernominee, of any color, with views more in tune with theirown? They have been around long enough to know better thanthat. The most they can hope for is to inflict a defeat thatwill intimidate other blacks from speaking out against theorthodoxy on which the Washington Beltway's blackestablishment has built its political clout and financialsecurity.   Affirmative action has &quot;worked&quot; in the U.S. in the sameway that similar group-preference policies have &quot;worked&quot; inIndia, Malaysia and other countries: It has benefited theelites, not the masses, and inflamed intergroup relations.   By opposing Judge Thomas, the black establishmentmaintains its status as gatekeeper for blacks advancing tohigher office and also preserves its position as part of alarger political coalition. By being out front, establishmentleaders provide political cover for predominantly whitegroups in the coalition to attack the nominee withoutappearing to be racist.   Ironically, it is Judge Thomas who some of the shrillercritics claim has &quot;sold out.&quot; Yet according to the officialpapers he has filed, the nominee has a net worth that's noteven half of what some of the Beltway fat cats earn in oneyear. Clarence Thomas could make several times his currentsalary by becoming a civil-rights attorney, threateningemployers with lawsuits or advising them how to avoid them.   The grand myth of the Beltway is that blacks as a groupowe their advancement to the affirmative-action policiespromoted by the civil-rights organizations. This is an opendefiance of history.   The economic advancement of blacks, both absolutely andrelative to whites, went on for generations before thecivil-rights legislation of the 1960s or theaffirmative-action policies of the 1970s. In 1939, theaverage income of black workers was less than half that ofwhite workers. By 1948, it was a little more than half, andby 1960 it was about two-thirds.   The well-known study &quot;A Common Destiny&quot; (produced underthe auspices of the National Academy of Sciences and with theparticipation of a number of black scholars) reported thatfrom 1940 to 1973 there was &quot;a clear record of improvingmaterial status of blacks relative to whites followed bystagnation and decline.&quot; This period of &quot;stagnation anddecline&quot; was the era of the &quot;goals and timetables&quot; to whichblacks supposedly owe their progress.   Affirmative action has been only one of many policiespromoted by minority elites that have benefited those elitesbut not the masses in whose name they spoke. All sorts ofgovernment programs, as well as similar programs in privateindustry and academia, have provided lucrative employment tominority elites as officials, consultants, researchers andattorneys, without benefiting the truly disadvantaged.Indeed, the precipitous decline of the black family, whichhad weathered every adversity from slavery to depressions, issymptomatic of the counterproductive effects of thewelfare-state approach promoted by the elites.   Judge Thomas has been denounced for his talks to blackaudiences emphasizing self-reliance. Contrary toself-interested distortions of his critics, self-reliance isnot a doctrine of denying benefits to the disadvantaged. Itis advice to the disadvantaged as to where they are likely toget the best payoffs for their efforts.   Important as these social-policy issues are in themselves,they are tangential to the duties of a Supreme Court justice,unless one believes that judges are put on the bench to makesocial policy. But since such issues have been injected intothe confirmation controversy, let them at least be discussedaccurately and honestly.   ---   Mr. Sowell is a fellow at the Hoover Institution.</TEXT></DOC>
