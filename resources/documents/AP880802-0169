(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A maple syrup producer has agreed to pay$25,000 in fines as part of a settlement following allegations thatthe firm mislabeled maple products.   Maple Grove Farms of Vermont Inc. in St. Johnsbury neitheradmitted nor denied any wrongdoing. But it agreed to pay the finesto the state and to reimburse the $10,000 it cost the VermontDepartment of Agriculture to investigate the matter.   The company also agreed to make a $15,000 donation to mapleresearch at the University of Vermont.   The complaint included allegations that the company labeledmaple syrup at a higher grade than it should have been and soldproducts carrying labels such as ``pure Vermont maple candy'' thatincluded cane sugar.   Maple Grove President William Callahan III said in a preparedstatement that the company was being ``taken out to the woodshedfor some problems beyond our control and others for which we canmake little argument.''   He said the company agreed to the fine to avoid a costly legalbattle.   The settlement followed an investigation by the attorneygeneral's office.   ``We've just come through the two absolute worst years in themaple business, not only in terms of quantity but also in terms ofquality,'' Callahan said in a telephone interview. ``It wasdifficult to have syrup at the higher end of grade range. It wouldnot withstand the test of time.''   As part of the settlement, Maple Grove is to notify customersthat some sryup sold in 1987 and during the first three months of1988 may have darkened, fallen below grade or been misgraded. Somechanges in labeling also were agreed upon on containers thatcontain syrup not produced in Vermont.   Maple Grove also agreed to recall maple candy sold between April1987 and April 1988. The candy is to be re-labeled as amaple-flavored product or destroyed.   Steven Wallach of the Vermont Department of Agriculture saidthat while inspectors are continously sampling maple products, noother companies were involved in this investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
