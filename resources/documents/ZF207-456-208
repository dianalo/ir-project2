(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Steven BurkeandM;The Department of Commerce last week proposed a dramatic relaxation of exportrestrictions that would make it easier to sell AT compatibles to the SovietUnion and other Eastern Bloc countries.andM;&quot;If this is approved, it could eventually mean boom times for U.S.andP;  exportersof PC and PC-compatible products in Eastern Bloc countries,&quot; said Jon Stout,president of Inex Technology International, a Washington trade and exportcompany that specializes in computers and telecommunications.andP;  &quot;This is asignificant development for U.S.andP;  trade.&quot;andM;Under the proposal, U.S.andP;  computer makers could ship AT-compatible computersto the Eastern Bloc without having to obtain a license from the Department ofCommerce.andM;Stout, who helped close a $2.1 million sale of laptops to the Soviet Unionthis year, however, is skeptical that the proposal will go into effect.andP;  &quot;Theodds for total deregulation are slim because of the political struggle thatis taking place,&quot; he said.andM;Capitol Hill Dispute BeginsandM;In fact, the Commerce Department's proposal touched off a political firestorm in the Capitol when Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney publiclycriticized Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher's recommendation to deregulateAT computers.andM;&quot;I disagree with raising the level of sophistication of these computers tothe Soviet Union or to East Bloc countries, because I do believe it wouldgive them significant capabilities that they do not now possess,&quot; Cheneysaid.andM;Before the proposal can go into effect, it must be approved by theCoordinating Committee Multilateral Export Controls (referred to as Cocom),the 17-nation body that regulates Western trade to Soviet Bloc countries.andO;The Cocom review will probably take several months, said a Department ofCommerce spokesman.andM;The trade recommendation was based on a study begun in January of foreignavailability of AT-compatible computers.andP;  The study found that Eastern Bloccountries can obtain AT PCs from many uncontrolled sources, and even foundmanufacturing sites in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.andM;Computer industry executives said Eastern Bloc countries can obtain ATcompatibles in large quantities from Taiwan and Singapore.andM;In a related action, the Commerce Department eliminated requirements forcomputer exporters to obtain specific approval for AT-compatible and MotorolaInc.andP;  68000 chip shipments to Cocom and Western nations.andM;The Department of Commerce refused to waive the license needed to ship386-based PCs and both Micro Channel and Extended Industry StandardArchitecture (EISA) PCs to either Western or Soviet Bloc countries, nor didit remove restrictions on high-performance and specially outfitted laptops.andM;Industry executives remained cautious about the potential impact on PC sales.andO;Even if Cocom approves the recommendation, major stumbling blocks prevent theEastern Bloc market from exploding.andP;  &quot;It's a positive development, but wewould not expect it to dramatically affect our business,&quot; said Tim Sheehy, aspokesman for IBM, in Washington.andM;&quot;The biggest obstacle is the limited supply of hard currency,&quot; said GlennSmith, president of Holographic Systems Inc., a Campbell, Calif., high-techmarketing and consulting company.andP;  &quot;No matter what you do, you still have tofind the guys with money.andP;  There is not an awful lot of spare cash [in SovietBloc countries].&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
