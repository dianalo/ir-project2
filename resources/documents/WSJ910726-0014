According to an FDIC official, the agency, in separatesuits filed in federal district courts in Dallas and Houston,is seeking damages of more than $100 million from many formerexecutives and directors of First Republic banks in eachcity. Among the charges are allegations of imprudent lendingpractices, the official said.</LP><TEXT>   NCNB Corp. took over First RepublicBank in a federallyassisted transaction that is expected to cost the FDIC $2.9billion. At the time of its collapse under the weight ofdisastrous real estate and energy loans, First RepublicBankCorp. was the largest bank holding company in Texas. Thecompany, which had $26.9 billion in assets when it failed inJuly 1988, was the product of the 1987 merger of InterFirstCorp. and First RepublicBank Corp.   Some of the officers of the failed company who are namedas defendants in the FDIC's suit are still with NCNB TexasNational Bank. NCNB, in a statement, said, &quot;There is no basisfor any comment on matters that occurred prior to any NCNBinvolvement. We expect to have no further comment on anyaspect of the matter while it is pending in the courts.&quot;   The suits are part of the FDIC's effort to recoup itslosses from the failure. (The company isn't related to FirstRepublic Bancorp of San Francisco.) The company previouslyreached an agreement with the FDIC to settle the agency'sclaims against the company and its IFRB Corp. subsidiary for$158.2 million.   The suit, filed on behalf of the FDIC by the Chattanooga,Tenn., law firm of Miller andamp; Martin, wasn't immediatelyavailable.   The suits had been expected. Last week, FirstRepublicBank, which sought bankruptcy-court protectionshortly after its banks failed, said payments to a majorityof creditors under its Chapter 11 reorganization plans wouldbe delayed pending a judge's approval of a settlement ofcertain potential claims by former officers and directors.The officers and directors were seeking indemnity by thecompany against claims by the FDIC and others.   The reorganization plans for the company and IFRB, whichtook effect July 15, call for creditors to receive $467million.   One former director of First RepublicBank, H.R. &quot;Bum&quot;Bright of Dallas, who was instrumental in the merger thatcreated the company, said late last night that he would besurprised by the FDIC's claims. &quot;The FDIC approved themerger,&quot; he said.   &quot;If anyone should be called on the carpet,&quot; he said, itshould be Congress for writing the tax-law changes of 1986that removed tax incentives for real-estate investments andhelped sink many real-estate projects, and their lenders. Mr.Bright, as the largest shareholder in First RepublicBank,suffered a loss of $30 million in the company's failure.</TEXT></DOC>
