(NMI) will make its bid for apiece of the document-processing market with the June launch of a programdesigned to organize and retrieve spreadsheet, word-processing and graphicsfiles over local and wide area networks.andM;LANfolio's ability to help an unlimited number of users seamlessly managedocuments across enterprisewide networks will put the software a step aheadof the half-dozen similar PC programs on the market, said Paul Hunt, NMI'sdirector of software development in New York.andM;Most of those programs, such as PerfectSolutions Inc.'s namesake software andCMS Data Inc.'s PC DOCS, enable LAN users to store and retrieve text andword-processing documents, but do not provide seamless access to files onremote servers.andM;Behind LANfolio's ability to present users with a unified view of documentson multiple, disparate servers is a program component called the documentrequest server, Hunt said.andP;  The software resides on each local server in theenterprisewide network, maintaining a local &quot;profile&quot; -- including author,subject and the like -- of all network documents and their location, he said.andO;LANfolio also enables users to customize this profile screen.andM;To search for a document, a user enters information contained in the profile.andM;The document request server locates the document, retrieves it, then sends itto the user's workstation.andM;This approach contrasts with that of PC DOCS, for example, which presents theuser with a list of all the remote servers.andP;  Before initiating a documentretrieval, the user must first select a server on which to search for thedocument.andM;NMI is augmenting LANfolio's unique search capabilities with an optionalfeature for storing and retrieving scanned images.andP;  With the optionalImagefolio hardware and software, which is installed at a workstation, userscan enter image-based or handwritten documents, then create a profile forthat document much as they would for a text file, Hunt said.andM;Potential users lauded the combination of LANfolio's rich feature set and itsability to create custom profiles.andM;&quot;I think LANfolio is going to be superlative once it's done,&quot; said RayeSchwartz, computer services manager for Powenley and Updike, a New York-basedlaw firm currently evaluating document-processing programs.andP;  &quot;I like the ideathat you can control the layout of the screen, then use it over a largenetwork.&quot;andM;LANfolio version 1.0 will work with DOS workstations on NetWare and VINESnetworks, Hunt said.andM;The 10-user version will cost about $4,000.andP;  The Imagefolio hardware andsoftware will be about $36,000.andM;NMI can be contacted at (212) 797-3800.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
