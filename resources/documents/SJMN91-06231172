In all, 42 graduates of 16U.S. business schools are members of the initial corps.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Professional Careers  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MBAS TAKE NEW SKILLS TO OLD WORLD  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The program is the brainchild of students and professors at the KenanInstitute of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill's graduate businessschool. Teresa Dalton, a spokeswoman for the school, said the program is thefirst in the country that allows master of business administration graduatesto share their skills with companies adapting to a free enterprise system.;   Margaret Minichini, a New York native who just received an MBA from UNC, willtake a job with a new bank in Prague.;    &quot;This is a historic moment,&quot; saidMinichini. &quot;I've worked in a large corporate environment before. Now, I'd liketo do something that's beneficial to me and for other people.&quot;;    Minichiniwas selected for the bank job because of her eight years with Federal ExpressCorp., where she helped open branch offices. The new bank wants to startbranches in post offices in Czechoslovakia.;    Comparing the Enterprise Corpsto the Peace Corps isn't entirely accurate, though.;    &quot;If they do their jobswell, the graduates will be extraordinary job candidates for any company thatwants to be in business in these countries,&quot; said David Miller, an associatedean at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. &quot;It will be an enormousboost to their careers.&quot;;    They'll need good jobs when they return to theUnited States. Salaries average only about $300 a month.;    The 42 graduateswere selected from 185 applicants. Each will spend at least a year workingwith companies including banks, manufacturers and a movie studio. For thethree weeks before departure, each participant received language andcross-cultural training at UNC.;    Miller said the students will help thecompanies learn about systems -- how to establish accounting or inventorysystems, for instance.;    &quot;Any graduate of an MBA program can develop anaccounting system that will help the companies understand what their costs areand what their expenses are,&quot; said Miller. &quot;In a country with a centrallyplanned economy, there's been no thought for systems like that. Thesegraduates will have a profound impact on what people think.;    &quot;This is theright thing for American business schools to be involved in,&quot; Miller said.&quot;It's going to be a boost to free enterprise. In the long term, it will openmarkets for American companies.&quot;;    Tonica Smith, a Mount Airy native whoreceived her MBA from the University of Virginia, is one of four participantswho will work at a steel manufacturer in Krakow, Poland.;    &quot;I want to teachperhaps a new way of learning,&quot; said Smith. &quot;I'd even like to give them alanguage so they can talk to Westerners after we're gone.&quot;;    Like most ofthe Enterprise Corps members who boarded a Pan Am flight in Charlotte, Smithtoted a personal computer. Few Eastern European companies have computers.;   Stuffed inside the suitcases, boxes and duffel bags that choked the area infront of the Pan Am counter were bicycles, boom boxes, heavy coats andtoiletries -- the types of personal belongings that make a year in EasternEurope survivable.;    Smith also packed some Matchbox toy cars. She learnedin the cross-cultural training that giving gifts -- especially to children --is an important custom in Poland.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  HARRY GREYARD, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Charlotte, N.C.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910818  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1PC  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  605  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday August 18, 199100231172,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
