The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said Tuesday the StateDepartment already had begun notifying friendly nations in theregion of the decision.   The Pentagon now expects the three minesweepers to depart thegulf by the middle of March, the sources added.   ``The ships are being withdrawn because the threat has reallylessened'' since a cease-fire took effect last August, said oneranking Pentagon official.   ``But we're not withdrawing all of them because there is still anoccasional floater (underwater mine) out there. We're scaling backat what we deem a prudent pace.''   The decision to halve the number of minesweepers in the regioncomes as American allies such as England and Italy are calling hometheir naval forces, and when the U.S. Navy has stopped side-by-sideescorts for convoys of oil tankers.   It also comes as the Joint Chiefs of Staff debate a proposal tostop paying danger pay to U.S. sailors working inside the PersianGulf, and as Kuwait prepares to drop American registry for six ofthe 11 tankers that the Navy had been protecting.   ``We don't see any of the real issues being settled between Iranand Iraq in peace talks, but on the other hand we don't see thetruce breaking down, either,'' said one administration official.``So everybody continues to scale back.''   In a related development, the four-star general who heads theU.S. Central Command told Congress on Tuesday that the Soviet Unionwas attempting to curry greater favor with _ and influence over _Iran.   ``There are signs that their relations are already improving,''said Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the head of the command responsiblefor U.S. forces in the Middle East.   ``It is important that we avoid a precipitous drawdown of U.S.military forces that would send the wrong signal as regards theUnited States commitment to sustaining peace in the region,''Schwarzkopf told the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee.   ``The United States must not lessen interest in the region norpermit that perception to develop.''   The defense sources said Tuesday they expected the threeminesweepers that would be recalled would be the ones deployed fromthe West Coast _ the Esteem, Conquest and Enhance. The other threeships _ the Fearless, Inflict and Illusive _ traveled to the regionfrom ports on the East Coast.   The Korean War-vintage craft were ordered to the gulf in thesummer of 1987, shortly after the reflagged Kuwaiti tanker Bridgetonstruck a mine while steaming in a U.S. convoy. The ships did notarrive until November 1987, however, because they were towed acrossthe Pacific and Atlantic to hold down engine wear.   The Navy has been criticized for its slow pace in replacing theaging minesweepers with a more capable, modern mine-sweeping vessel.But the six ships have found and neutralized a number of suspectedIranian mines.   The administration of former President Ronald Reagan agreed inthe spring of 1987 to extend American military protection to 11Kuwaiti tankers after they re-registered under the Stars andStripes. Kuwait, a friend of the United States and a key ally ofIraq, had seen its ships become a special target of Iranian forces.   After eight years of fighting, Iran and Iraq finally agreed to atruce last August and to date, the cease-fire has held.</TEXT></DOC>
