HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The military says it got just one false positiveresult in testing more than 135,000 recruits for the AIDS virus,lending support to those who favor widespread screening for thedisease.   The armed forces, which routinely screen all recruits foracquired immune deficiency syndrome, had only one false positive inchecking young men and women from areas where the AIDS virus israre.   The results of the military testing program are to be publishedThursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.   The risk of false positive results is often cited as an argumentagainst routinely screening people at low risk of AIDS infection,such as marriage license applicants. Some have suggested that thefalse positives might actually outnumber those who are trulyinfected with HIV, the AIDS virus.   Dr. Robert R. Redfield of the Walter Reed Army Institute ofResearch said the military program dispels that ``myth'' by showingthat AIDS testing can be performed quickly, cheaply and accurately.The test costs the government $3 per person, and the results areavailable within three days.   Military researchers said not all AIDS testing may be asaccurate and efficient as theirs.   ``Clearly, people who perform the test poorly will have badresults,'' Redfield said. ``I would like Americans to ask why theyoung men and women in the Department of Defense get an earlydiagnosis for a treatable, preventable disease, when they can't.The answer is there has been no leadership in the medical communityto provide that right to the American people.''   One critic of widespread testing, Dr. Lawrence Miike of theCongressional Office of Technology Assessment, said the reportshows that ``you can get this phenomenally high accuracy rate,which probably surpasses every other test there is.''   ``But I'm not worried about them,'' he said. ``I'm worried aboutlabs that advertise, `Come get your HIV test.' I get calls frompeople who say they are the victims of false positives.''   ``The question is not how well the best laboratories can do,''added Dr. Klemens B. Meyer of New England Medical Center in Boston.``The issue is how well most laboratories are performing, whetherthey will maintain this performance and whether it is good enough.''   Many experts agree that AIDS testing is sufficiently accuratewhen used among people who are at increased risk of the disease,such as homosexual men or drug addicts.   To learn how well it works among people at low risk, militaryresearchers reviewed 20 months of testing of recruits from ruralparts of 36 states with low AIDS rates.   Their initial check of the blood of 135,187 recruits showed that15 were infected. When they re-examined the blood of these 15 withfour different tests, they found that one of them was actually freeof the AIDS virus. The 14 others were in fact infected.   During the study, the HIV infection rate among the total 1.2million recruits was 1.48 per 1,000 people. The military doctorssaid their latest work suggests that among these people, there wasone false positive result for every 200 truly positive ones.   Redfield said the military testing has improved, and falsepositives are now probably about one in 1 million.   In the military program, blood is initially screened with aquick, easy test called an ELISA. If it's found to be positive forthe virus, it's checked again with the same test.   All blood that turns up positive in both tests is re-examinedwith a more time-consuming test called a Western blot. If thatshows the blood to be infected, a new sample is drawn from therecruit. If this also turns out to be positive on a Western blot,the recruit is considered to be infected with the AIDS virus.   Redfield said he believes that AIDS testing should be routinelyperformed in venereal disease clinics, in drug addiction programs,during pregnancy exams and when people are admitted to hospitals.</TEXT></DOC>
