Students marched by the tens of thousands to occupy the squareThursday and rally for more freedom. Some returned to class todayto end a two-week boycott but student leaders at Beijing Universityrefused to immediately call off the strike.   Zhao, in a speech made Thursday but reported today in the partyorgan People's Daily, said, ``Now we need broad consultations anddialogue _ dialogue with students, dialogue with workers, dialoguewith intellectuals.''   Student activists want the government to open talks with them ondemands for democracy, freedom of the press and an end to officialcorruption. Zhao, while saying talks were needed, did notspecifically promise any meeting.   The party leader acknowledged that great numbers of Chinese areexpressing anger toward official corruption, and attributed theproblem to a lack of openness and a faulty legal system.   Zhao also seemed to tone down earlier official claims thatstudents were being manipulated by people who wanted to see thecountry in turmoil. Such people ``are extremely few and we shouldmaintain vigilance. I think the vast majority of studentsunderstand this.''   Despite conciliatory official statements, some students feelthey must continue to pressure the government if concessions areever to be made in Communist China.   ``Who announced the return to class? Can you face yourconscience and compatriots at home and abroad who have cared for usand supported us?'' one student scrawled furiously on a sheet ofnewspaper that he posted at Beijing University.   Said an economics student who was reading the poster, ``If we goback to class now then there's no pressure on the government and itwon't recognize our independent union.''   Student leaders at Beijing University said they had not beennotified by the United Association of Beijing Universities, theumbrella group that has led the protests, of the decision to returnto class. A few classes were held at the university, but moststudents stayed away.   Some classes also were held at Beijing Normal College. Dozens ofother students sat in classrooms studying on their own and saidthey expected to resume their normal schedules on Monday.   The student march Thursday was their sixth in defiance of policeorders since April 17, and one of the largest.   About 100,000 people, half of them students, converged onTiananmen Square, the symbolic seat of power, to mark the 70thanniversary of China's first student movement. There, they held afestive rally for greater freedom, cleaner government, a free pressand official recognition of their United Association.   ``We have to transform China,'' said a 20-year-old student fromthe Political Science and Law College.   Thousands of Beijing residents lined the streets as the studentspassed and gave them applause, free drinks and cash donations. ``Westrongly support the students,'' said a man in grimy blue workclothes.   At a few intersections marchers had to shove their way throughhundreds of unarmed police lined six deep, but the governmentclearly wanted to avoid serious confrontation. The securitypresence was smaller than a week earlier, when about 150,000students and supporters marched on Tiananmen.   Although authorities had ordered the square closed Thursday, thepolice who surrounded it offered no resistance and quickly leftwhen the students arrived.   Wu'er Kaixi, one of the leaders of the United Association, saidafter the rally that the students' struggle for democracy andreform has entered a new phase that will focus on spreading theirmessage through pamphlets and setting up independent newspapers asan alternative voice to the official media.   Several official newspapers today carried their fullest accountsyet of any student protest since the campaign for democracy began.   ``Beijing's temperature yesterday hit 30 degrees centigrade (86Fahrenheit), but students streaming with sweat held a march just asorderly as the last time,'' China Youth News reported.   It also reported smaller marches in more than 11 cities,including Shanghai, Xian, Nanjing, Chengdu and Changsha, wherestudents had marched before in the past few weeks.   No violence was reported in any of the marches. The Legal Dailysaid the Xian students applied for and received police permissionfor their demonstration.   The demonstrations marked the May Fourth Movement of 1919,China's first student movement. It began in opposition toconcessions granted to the Japanese government during World War I,and developed into a movement calling for ``Mr. Democracy and Mr.Science'' to save China.</TEXT></DOC>
