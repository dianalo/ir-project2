But the rain didn't dampen spirits as hundreds of thousands ofpeople turned out, most sporting something green, whether it was agreen moustache, ``Irish Eyes'' glasses with green lenses orleprechaun hats, complete with pointed ears.   ``I've seen Disneyworld and Disneyland,'' said Bridget Powderly,an Irish-born Londoner in town specifically for the parade. ``Thisis better.''   The National Weather Service had predicted the rain could holdoff until evening, but called it a ``close race.''   About four hours into the parade, the luck of the Irish wore offand the rain won, substantially thinning the throngs of peoplelined up along the parade route.   About 2 million people watched last year's parade under sunnyskies and organizers had hoped to at least match that.   Ireland's patron saint was honored with parades elsewhere aroundthe country Saturday. New Orleans' parade was a feast _ literally,as float riders tossed the makings for Irish stew, includingcabbages, potatoes and carrots, to people lining the streets.   In the Northern California city of Dublin, officials decided togive up the traditional St. Patrick's Day green beer drinkingcontest.   Mayor Paul Moffatt said he had mixed feelings about dropping theevent, but said ``you don't want to advertise to young people thatit may be all right to get snockered.''   While New Yorkers were lamenting the rain on their parade,thousands of people in Kansas City, Mo., considered themselvesblessed with sunny skies.   ``We've had rain on every parade for the past five or sixyears,'' said parade organizer Bill Richerson. ``This one will bethe best we've had in several years. It's really helped thespirit.''   The Kansas City parade had more than 170 entrants, includingmarching bands, family floats, jig bands and ``Bugs O'Bunny.''   For New York's event, the usually natty Mayor David Dinkins worea shiny green jacket purchased specially for the occasion of hisfirst parade as the city's chief executive.   He was joined by about 125,000 other marchers _ including Gov.Mario Cuomo, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and former Mayor EdwardI. Koch.   ``It's a little bit of heaven,'' said Kathleen Sheridan, whocame from Ridgewood, N.J. to watch her fiance, a police officer,march.   ``I love the horses,'' said 3-year-old Sean Patrick Comiskey,whose entire family was bundled in green sweaters.</TEXT></DOC>
