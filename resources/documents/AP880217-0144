But Armed Forces chief Gen. Adolfo Blandon told reporters in theeastern city of Usulutan that six army troops, two guerrillas andsix civilians were killed during the attack.   The strikes, the largest guerrilla action in nearly a year,occurred only hours before the foreign ministers of the fiveCentral American nations met in San Salvador to evaluateimplementation of a regional peace plan.   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, orFMLN, attacked the 6th Infantry Brigade base in Usulutan, 68 milessoutheast of San Salvador, the clandestine rebel Radio Venceremossaid.   It claimed the rebels inflicted 190 casualties, but did notbreak down the dead and injured.   Army helicopters combed the area in search of the guerrillas,and more than a dozen houses near the base were totally orpartially destroyed, Blandon said.   A police spokesman in Usulutan said that a family of five,including three children, was killed when their house was destroyedduring the rebel strike.   The coordinated attacks were the largest in scale since the FMLNattacked the 4th Infantry Brigade in the northern province ofChalatenango last March 31, causing 70 deaths, including that of aU.S. military adviser, and more than 100 wounded.   Radio Venceremos said another 25 army troops were killed orwounded today in other dawn attacks in the eastern provinces of SanMiguel and Morazan. Guerrillas destroyed a cotton cooperative, 70utility poles, one electrical substation, two bridges and atelephone transmission station, rebel and police reports said..   Dubbed,``Death to the Killers of Herbert Anaya Sanabria,''today's operation launched a new rebel offenbsive to disruptlegislative and municipal elections slated for March 20, thebroadcast said.   Anaya was coordinator of the independent Salvadoran Human RightsCommission when he was gunned down Oct. 26.   Rebel-aligned political parties have boycotted previouselections, saying the security of their prospective candidatescould not be guarateed.   The FMLN warned last month it would not permit elections inareas under its control or in dispute.   The regional peace plan, signed by the presidents of ElSalvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica, calls forcease-fires, democratic reforms and an end to aid to insurgenciesin Central America.</TEXT></DOC>
