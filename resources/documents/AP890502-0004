New Yorkers will have their first opportunity to render anelectoral verdict on the scandals in today's elections for newcommunity school board members, but few expected a large turnout.   And no one even knows if the results of the election will standup. A federal judge last week struck down a new law prohibitingschool employees, political office holders and party officials fromsitting on the boards, but challenges were expected.   ``All of this is making the voters feel somewhat powerless,''said state Assemblyman Jose Serrano of the Bronx.   The city's 32 school boards were set up two decades ago when thecity's school system was decentralized to help parents andcommunities get a handle on their neighborhood schools.   The local boards operate 800 elementary and intermediateschools. Each board hires its schools' principals, assistantprincipals and district administrators and is responsible foreducating about 20,000 children from kindergarten through grades 8or 9.   The school system also maintains a bureaucracy of employees whowork in the central Board of Education headquarters. The centralboard operates the city's 115 senior high schools, negotiatescitywide contracts, maintains the system's 900 schools, setscitywide policy and, in theory, oversees the community boards.   But in the last few months, five school board officials in theBronx have been indicted on felony charges ranging from theft tobribe taking. Outraged over alleged criminality and provedmismanagement, schools Chancellor Richard R. Green has suspendedtwo Bronx school boards.   There also have been reports that principals and otheradministrators obtained their positions by paying bribes to schoolboard members.   ``The notion that you become a principal not on the merits, buton the basis of how much money you got in your pocket, to me, isjust mind boggling and it's outrageous. It just makes my bloodboil,'' said James F. Gill, a lawyer and former prosecutor headinga city commission charged with investigating the allegations ofwrongdoing.   At one school meeting in the Bronx, women publicly confronted aschool official with allegations he had offered to trade jobs forsex. Recent newspaper articles have told of booze-and-drug partieson school property, graft and corruption.   The scandals broke last November when a principal at a Bronxelementary school was arrested on drug charges. That was followedby arrests of several teachers on similar charges.   Criminal inquiries of some boards are under way in the boroughsof Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens; only Staten Islandhas escaped.   Educators, analysts and teacher union officials agree that thewrongdoing at the root of the scandals has had an affect on theperformance of many schools.   ``When people are misusing funds, then it takes away resourcesfrom the educational program. It directly affects what goes on inthe schools,'' said Thurston A. Atkins, a longtime observer ofdecentralization and a professor at Columbia University's TeachersCollege.   A Bronx teacher who who asked not to be identified put it moresuccinctly: ``It kills morale when you have to worry `Am I going tohave enough chalk, enough of this, enough of that.'''   The school system's decentralization was a product of theturbulent 1960s, a lengthy citywide teachers' strike and pressurefrom militant civil-rights activists.   The reform divided up the system to give local residents,particularly parents, a greater voice in the operation of theschools.   But with a disturbingly low voter turnout of 5 percent notuncommon in school elections, some boards are dominated not byparents but by political hacks who allegedly dole out jobs tosupporters, friends, relatives and sometimes applicants willing toput cash in the right pockets.   Stanley S. Litlow, executive director of Interface, a researchorganization concerned with education, has studied the schools fora dozen years and blames voter apathy on the timing of theelections _ which are not held on regular election days but in thespring of every third year _ and the little media attention theygenerally get.   ``The confused structure'' of the school system also promoteslow turnout, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
