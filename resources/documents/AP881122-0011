North to prevent nationalsecurity secrets from being disclosed.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell did not say that Reaganshould consider pardoning the four Iran-Contra defendants butsuggested other means by which the trial could be stopped.   He said that under the Classified Information Procedures Act,Reagan could declare that the danger of disclosing highly sensitivegovernment secrets was so great that the charges must be dropped.The president, as the nation's chief law enforcement officer, couldeither directly order the case dropped or he could invoke secrecylaws to prevent disclosure of classified information, which couldhave the same effect.   ``The Constitution does not permit the court to take thistestimony in secret, as did the Congress. It must be public,''Gesell said, adding he would have ``very little control over thecontent of the testimony.''   ``Accordingly, if on analysis this imminent prospect gives groundfor presidential action to protect any perceived threat to theforeign policy obligations which the president has or theintelligence needs of the country, the Constitution and the statutesprovide various courses of action he may take,'' the judge said.   Reagan, meanwhile, reiterated previous statements he had made onthe question when asked whether he would pardon North.   ``No, and I don't think it's time for that while it's in thecourts,'' Reagan said at a ground-breaking ceremony for hispresidential library at Simi Valley, Calif.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The presidentbelieves the legal process should take its course. The president isnot considering a pardon.''   A senior administration official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said, ``We are fully aware that some documents andevidence in the case pose significant security risks.'' When areporter suggested the White House was attempting to throw thedecision back to Gesell, the official did not disagree.   The testimony of current or former government officials``acquainted with high security matters'' poses a ``difficultsituation for those who may have foreign policy or national securityconcerns,'' Gesell said at the hearing.   These prosecution witnesses, who include former national securityadviser Robert McFarlane, ``will be subjected to intensecross-examination'' by North's lawyers, the judge said.   The defense ``will be granted wide latitude'' to question thesewitnesses about their motives for testifying against the formerNational Security Council aide.   Gesell said such questioning might involve ``sensitive eventsother than events relevant under the indictment.''   Gesell, in urging Reagan to focus on the secrecy issue, said thecase was ``rapidly approaching trial,'' probably by late January.   The judge made the comments at the conclusion of a two-hourhearing on North's motions to dismiss the central conspiracy chargesagainst him and his three co-defendants, former national securityadviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and RichardV. Secord.   Separate trials have been ordered for each defendant.   Gesell indicated that he wouldn't dismiss the charge that allfour defendants conspired to defraud the government by setting upthe secret arms-supply network for the Nicaraguan rebels anddiverted U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds to finance the insurgents,known as Contras.   Gesell said defense lawyers could not ``legally wrap themselvesin the president's cloak'' unless it appeared that the presidentdirected the diversion of funds to the Contras and the obstructionof inquiries into the matter.   But he suggested that two other charges that the defendants stolegovernment property and committed wire fraud needlessly duplicatedthe conspiracy count.   He also expressed skepticism about whether prosecutors couldprove the defendants embezzled profits from the arms-for-hostagesales, saying ``you don't know where the money went. You can't tracethe money.''   ``The money did go in large part to the Contras,'' said Bruce A.Green, an associate independent counsel. ``What we are alleging isthat money went in large part for other purposes... not authorized''when Reagan approved the arms sales.   The judge rebuked the Justice Department for itsfriend-of-the-court brief challenging independent counsel LawrenceE. Walsh's theory that North could be prosecuted for obstructingcongressional oversight of foreign policy.   The Justice Department, invoking the separation-of-powerdoctrine, said Walsh had overstated Congress' role in foreignaffairs, which it said was primarily a presidential function.   Gesell said Reagan's authorization of North's prosecution refutesthe department's ``suggestion that independent counsel is acting indisregard of the president's primary responsibility for the conductof foreign affairs and protection of national security.''</TEXT></DOC>
