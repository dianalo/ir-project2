Darman, director of the Office ofManagement and Budget, said in a letter to the president.   The automatic cuts can be avoided, Darman wrote, if Congress willfully implement the budget agreement worked out with the White Houselast April. ``Although there has been some progress toward itsimplementation, virtually none of the ... (spending cuts and revenueincreases) required to fulfill the terms of the agreement has yetbeen enacted,'' Darman said.   Legislation to carry out the agreement will be the chief businessfacing Congress when it returns from a summer recess on Sept. 5.   Darman's projection of the deficit is based on forecasts aboutinflation and economic growth that are more optimistic than those ofthe Congressional Budget Office.   CBO last week issued its own estimate that unless the budgetagreement is implemented, the deficit in budget year 1990, whichbegins Oct. 1, would reach $141.5 billion, or $25.5 billion higherthan the OMB prediction.   Most of that differece is caused by the two agencies' varyingforecasts of how the economy will fare next year and on technicaldetails of how the recently enacted bailout of the savings and loanindustry will be implemented.   Under the law, only the OMB figures are used to determine whetherthe deficit has been reduced sufficiently and whether mostgovernment spending programs must be slashed across the board toclose the gap.   The Gramm-Rudman law, which requires a balanced budget by 1993,limits the 1990 deficit to $100 billion, but includes $10 billioncushion before across-the-board spending cuts are forced. However,once the cuts are ordered, they must be sufficient to reduce thedeficit to $100 billion _ not $110 billion.   Under Darman's forecast, the 1990 deficit will be $116.2 billionif Congress takes no further action to reduce it. That compares withjust under $170 billion this year.   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House BudgetCommittee, called the OMB forecast artificially low. ``Even withthese dubious economic and spending assumptions, we face thepossibility of harsh across-the-board spending cuts this fall _ $8.1billion in domestic programs and $8.1 billion in defense,'' he saidin a statement.   Even if those automatic reductions are made, Panetta said, ``westill need $30 billion to $60 billion in additional deficitreduction for 1991.''   Social Security and some other ``safety net'' programs are exemptfrom automatic cuts. Even so, said Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota,senior Republican on the House Budget Committee, said ``I thinkpeople will notice in a big hurry'' if the mandatory cuts takeeffect.   ``I think we are going to have some big difficulties'' appoving apackage of spending cuts and revenue increases to implement theApril agreement, Frenzel told reporters. ``But my guess is thatCongress is going to lurch across the finish line all right'' andavoid the automatic reductions, he said.   Darman's report offers examples of how the ax would fall if themandated spending cuts take effect:</TEXT><TEXT>   _The Drug Enforcement Administration would be left with lessmoney than it has this year, which ``could undermine its ability towage an aggresive war on drugs.''   _The Public Health Service's efforts to prevent the spread ofAIDS would be hampered significantly.   _All Federal Aviation Administration personnel, including flightcontrollers, might be furloughed for three days a month.   _The Internal Revenue Service might lose 4,700 employees andreduce taxpayer-assistance phone calls by 10 million.   _The Defense Department could be forced to slash manpower by160,000.</TEXT></DOC>
