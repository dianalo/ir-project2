The patent, issued to Ajinomoto of Japan, covers genetic engineering technologies used to produce Interleukin-2, a protein involved in the immune system that is being tested as a treatment for certain forms of cancer. A number of companies are experimenting with the drug.    Jon Saxe, vice president and chief patent counsel for Hoffmann-La Roche, said, &quot;We aren't aware of any recombinant Interleukin-2 in the clinic that is produced by a method that doesn't fall within the issued claims.&quot;    If the patent position is as strong as the companies say, other firms will need to secure a license to market the drug.    Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, N.J., a unit of Swiss-based F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co., is conducting clinical testing of the drug at medical centers in the U.S. Immunex retains the right to manufacture a portion of the Interleukin-2 sold by Hoffmann-La Roche, and will receive royalties on world-wide sales of the drug, should it be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Immunex shares closed at $15, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
