(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former ``superbroker'' forPaineWebber Inc. won a breach of contract and defamation suitagainst the securities firm on Thursday, but a jury awarded himonly 18 cents in damages in a verdict that he nevertheless termed amoral victory.   Former broker Geoffrey J. Winters had sought $16 million indamages, but the Bridgeport Superior Court jury also found that heowed the Wall Street firm money for two promissary notes, plusattorneys fees resulting from the legal battle, which reduced hisaward to just 18 cents if the verdict holds up.   Winters' attorney said his client achieved a ``moral victory.''   ``PaineWebber can't treat people like this again,'' saidattorney John H. Chapman. ``...These jurors are now telling themthey have to be ethical.''   Winters agreed he had secured a moral victory, but declinedfurther comment.   Alan R. Spirer, PaineWebber's attorney said he consideredPaineWebber the victor, in light of Winters' reduced damage award.He also said he would file motions to set aside the verdict and toreduce the damage award.   The complicated case had been watched closely on Wall Street,because it is unusual for brokers to sue their former employers.   The case began in 1982, when Winters left Lehman Brothers KuhnLoeb, now Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., to join PaineWebber. He andother new employees who produced more than $1 million in annualcommissions were touted as ``superbrokers'' to potentialPaineWebber customers.   When he joined the firm, Winters was given two, five-yearpromissary notes by PaineWebber for $240,000 and $60,000,respectively. Both were secured by a $300,000 bonus Wintersreceived from the company.   On March 23, 1984, PaineWebber fired Winters for alleged willfulmisconduct. Winters filed suit in New York state and federalcourts, claiming PaineWebber had hired him only to steal hismultimillion-dollar client base.   PaineWebber sued him in Bridgeport Superior Court to collect onthe promissary notes. The company also filed a $300,000 lien onWinters' Greenwich home. Winters attached several counterclaims,contending he had been defamed and seeking damages.   The New York lawsuits were put on hold pending the outcome ofthe Connecticut case. Spirer said Thursday's verdict also rendersmoot the pending lawsuit in New York state court, although Chapmanrefused to discuss the matter.   The Bridgeport jury decided Winters must repay the $300,000 forthe two promissary notes, plus $140,000 in attorney fees, or atotal of $440,000 to PaineWebber.   The jury awarded Winters $140,000 in damages on his claim thatPaineWebber improperly took possession of Winters' personal files,preventing him from doing business and causing him damage and$300,000 on his claim that PaineWebber made false and defamatorystatements about Winters in a Wall Street publication.   The jury also awarded Winters ``nominal damages'' on three othercounterclaims against the firm, including his breach of contractcomplaint.   Because the relationship between PaineWebber and Wintersoccurred in New York, the damages were based on New York state law,Chapman said. Under New York law, the jury could award only nominaldamages _ or 6 cents per claim _ on the three claims after awardingWinters $140,000 on the other damage claim, Chapman said.   Judge Dennis F. Harrigan rejected PaineWebber's request that hedirect the jury to reject all counterclaims.</TEXT></DOC>
