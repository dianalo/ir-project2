(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After 13 years of protests and wrangling,Seabrook nuclear power plant officials got their testing licenseFriday and began laying plans to start their first atomic chainreaction, possibly within a week.   The license, the biggest milestone yet for a project that is 10years late and billions over budget, was granted by the NuclearRegulatory Commission Friday morning. A federal appeals courtdeclined to delay the tests late Thursday.   The license does not settle disputes over evacuation planningfor crowded beaches and coastal communities within 10 miles ofSeabrook _ the key issue blocking commercial operation of the $6billion reactor.   Seabrook officials hope to receive a commercial license in thefall, but Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and other plant foespromise to keep fighting _ to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.   But ``the fact is the low-power license means that all thetechnical issues have been resolved, and that's a very criticalstep,'' said the plant's top executive, Edward Brown.   Relief was palpable among officials at a project that has facedcountless licensing and financial setbacks and years ofhigh-visibility demonstrations.   Inside the Seabrook gates, a sign on the road leading to thepower plant and posters inside the administration buildingproclaimed: ``License Received! A time for pride. A time forpower.''   Beaming plant executives congratulated each other as they readcopies of the freshly issued license.   Before starting the testing, plant operators planned to spend aday or so reviewing voluminous technical specifications attached tothe license. Joseph Grillo, the plant's operations manager, said heexpected no surprises.   ``We know pretty much what's coming,'' Grillo said. ``We haven'tbeen doing this in a vacuum. We've been negotiating'' with the NRCstaff on technical issues.   The testing process likely will start this weekend, plantofficials said. Valves will be opened and water will be pumpedthrough the reactor coolant system. Friction from the rapidcirculation would heat the reactor from 150 degrees to itsoperating temperature of 557 degrees.   After a five-day warmup, operators would set the stage for anuclear chain reaction by withdrawing neutron-absorbing controlrods from the reactor fuel core and reducing the amount ofneutron-absorbing boron in the coolant water, eventually lettinguranium atoms start fissioning.   Brown estimated the plant would achieve initial ``criticality''_ its first self-sustained fission reaction _ within seven to 10days.   That could coincide with a rally and mass civil disobedienceaction planned months ago for next weekend by the ClamshellAlliance, which for 13 years has organized protests that haveresulted in nearly 2,500 arrests and in the name Seabrook becomingsynonymous with anti-nuclear activism.   ``Will we modify our schedule to tie into what the demonstratorsare doing at any point in time?'' Brown said. ``The answer is no.''   Clamshell organizers, vowing non-violence, say protesters planto try to climb fences surrounding the site but won't try to reachan inner fence around the plant itself.   Seabrook's opponents argue that stopping the plant is crucialfor the health and safety of tens of thousands of people who livenearby or crowd seacoast beaches as close as 1.7 miles from thereactor.   Brown, president of Seabrook operator New Hampshire Yankee,maintains that Seabrook is ``the safest power plant that's everbeen built'' and that evacuation plans for surrounding communitieswould protect the public in the unlikely event of an accident.Federal licensing board hearings on the plans are in progress.   Seabrook supporters say the 1,150-megawatt reactor is vitallyneeded to meet New England's burgeoning power demand.   Nuclear industry officials worldwide also see Seabrook ascrucial to their hopes of fostering development of a new generationof reactors, Brown acknowledged.   ``We're aware the rest of the industry is watching us, but we'renot out there fighting the industry's battles,'' he said.   Seabrook officials had fought nearly three years for thelow-power license after the plant was completed in July, 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
