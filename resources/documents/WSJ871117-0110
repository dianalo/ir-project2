MangunoStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST </IN><DATELINE> SEOUL, South Korea  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Worsening campaign violence and an acrimonious debate over the military's role in South Korean politics are dominating the country's first free presidential election in 16 years.    President Chun Doo Hwan yesterday formally set a Dec. 16 date for the vote, and the 120,000-man police force was put on alert to maintain order. Mr. Chun's declaration opened a 30-day campaign period, although the main contenders have been organizing and seeking votes for months.    Regional antagonisms, feuding between the two main opposition candidates and a revival of attacks on the ruling-party nominee for his role in a 1979 coup that helped bring Mr. Chun to power have overshadowed other issues in the politicking. Incidents of violence have multiplied, most recently with disruptions at three separate rallies on Saturday.    &quot;The whole election has degenerated into regional hatred, recriminations over the past and threats that old scores must be settled,&quot; said a Western diplomat. &quot;It is posing an extremely serious danger to the whole election process.&quot;    Provincialism, which has long plagued Korean politics, has flared anew in recent weeks as the rivalry intensified between the two main opposition challengers to Roh Tae Woo, the standard-bearer of the ruling Democratic Justice Party. It emerged Saturday as tens of thousands of supporters of candidate Kim Dae Jung in the southwestern city of Kwangju broke up a campaign rally by his fellow opposition leader, Kim Young Sam.    Kwangju is the seat of South Cholla province, longtime rival of the neighboring Kyongsang provinces that have dominated South Korean politics since the end of the Korean War. Kwangju also is the stronghold of Kim Dae Jung.    Kim Young Sam, a native of South Kyongsang, had gone to Kwangju in the hope of proving that the election could transcend regionalism, according to an aide. That hope was soon dashed.    Demonstrators shouting &quot;Kim Young Sam concede&quot; and &quot;Kim Dae Jung for president&quot; crowded the plaza in front of Kwangju's railway station, where Kim Young Sam was attempting to speak. Supporters of the rival Kims traded punches. Other protesters in the plaza chanted slogans denouncing the ruling party's Mr. Roh and threw rocks at riot police, who, in turn, fired tear gas at demonstrators.    Kim Young Sam, shouting to the crowd that violence &quot;will only benefit Roh Tae Woo,&quot; was pelted with eggs and apples. He finally gave up and left Kwangju without delivering his prepared speech.    Saturday's violence came two weeks after a similar incident in Pusan, Kim Young Sam's stronghold, in which dozens of his supporters attacked a hotel where Kim Dae Jung was staying.    Kim Dae Jung had further problems with demonstrators Sunday. A campaign rally in Taegu, capital of North Kyongsang, was disrupted by egg-throwing protesters urging Mr. Kim to get out of the presidential race.    Meantime, the campaigns of the ruling party's Mr. Roh and of Kim Jong Pil, who was prime minister under the late President Park Chung Hee, have also been marked by violent demonstrations.    At a rally Saturday in Puchon, an industrial city east of Seoul, groups of youths shouted at Mr. Roh to quit the campaign. At the same time, parents demanding the release of their children and others imprisoned for violent political acts fought with ruling-party supporters. The Puchon rally was the fourth Roh rally to turn violent. His campaign chief accused student activists of trying to sabotage his election bid.    Even as police fought demonstrators in the streets of Kwangju and Puchon, President Chun Doo Hwan, who has promised to give way to the election winner when his term ends Feb. 25, expressed misgivings about the election campaign.    &quot;Regional antagonism incited by some politicians and the acts of violence committed by reckless radical forces are a frontal challenge to the development of genuine democracy,&quot; he said in a statement yesterday. On Saturday, he complained to his cabinet that candidates who had promised to serve all 40 million South Koreans were &quot;fanning provincialism and resorting to character assassination.&quot;    The mention of character assassination was an allusion to opposition charges that Mr. Roh belongs to a military elite that has unconstitutionally ruled the country since 1980. Mr. Roh has also been hounded by allegations that he is unfit for the presidency because of his close connections with President Chun, especially his critical role in the Dec. 12, 1979, coup that helped bring Mr. Chun to power.    Those allegations were fueled last week by Mr. Roh's admission that it was he, as the general commanding the Ninth Infantry Division, who ordered the mobilization of troops against then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Chung Sung Hwa, a move that eventually led to then-Gen. Chun's takeover of the government.    But Mr. Roh said Thursday that he had acted &quot;to save the nation&quot; during a power vacuum created by the assassination of President Park seven weeks earlier.    Opposition candidates and other critics said Thursday's admission should disqualify Mr. Roh for the presidency. But some political analysts said his explanation might bolster his candidacy at a time when public disgust with the two Kims seems to be growing.    &quot;The Korean people are so sick of reading and hearing about the two Kims -- about how each of them believes God has anointed him to save the nation -- that they are even ready to forgive and accept Roh,&quot; said a Seoul political scientist. &quot;When he wins, they'll have nobody to blame but their greedy, ambitious selves.&quot;    The revived debate over the Dec. 12 controversy has provoked grumbling from some active military leaders about their right and duty to safeguard the nation during times of upheaval.    The sensitive subject of the military's involvement in politics was fanned by a guest column in the latest edition of the Far Eastern Economic Review by Hur Hwa Pyung, formerly President Chun's senior secretary for political affairs. He wrote that recent attacks on the military overlooked &quot;political reality.&quot; Opposition leaders claimed the article sets the stage for justifying another military takeover if Mr. Roh loses the election. </TEXT></DOC>
