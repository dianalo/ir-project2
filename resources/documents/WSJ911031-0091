U.S. Judge Milton I. Shadur's ruling marks the latest in aseries of legal victories for medical-care providers who havechallenged as insufficient the payment states provide forcare of poor patients.</LP><TEXT>   Already, U.S. courts have found Medicaid plans in severalstates to be inadequate on essentially the same legal basis.A 1990 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed hospitals and otherproviders to sue for better Medicaid reimbursement rates, andthe success of the litigation spawned by that findingsuggests that both states and the federal government willsoon be paying substantially more than they currently do forhealth care.   The Illinois Health Care Association had sued the state'sDepartment of Public Aid, alleging that the state violatedthe Boren Amendment of the Medicaid Act.   That amendment requires states to pay hospitals andnursing homes rates that have been established as &quot;reasonableand adequate&quot; by means of formal &quot;methods and standards&quot; tobe devised by each state. The association in Illinois, whichrepresents 270 nursing homes, alleged that the state reliedonly on budgetary considerations in determining Medicaidnursinghome reimbursement rates, and that payments wereinadequate.   In his summary judgment, Judge Shadur said the state &quot;haswholly failed to make the findings required by the BorenAmendment and its implementing regulations.&quot; It hasn't takenthe &quot;first step in an adequate findings process --identifying the `objective benchmark' of an efficiently andeconomically operated facility.&quot;   Indeed, the opinion says, the state's Department of PublicAid, &quot;does not know the costs of economically operating anursing home or whether its rates are adequate to cover suchcosts.&quot; Thus, assurances that payments were reasonable, whichit provided to the federal Department of Health and HumanServices as required by law, weren't adequately grounded.   The state currently spends about one billion dollarsannually on Medicaid payments for 60,000 nursing homeresidents; it receives half of the funds from the U.S.government.   A spokesman for Illinois Governor Jim Edgar said the statehasn't yet decided whether to appeal the ruling.   &quot;We're responding to the judge's ruling&quot; by collectingdata to establish acceptable guidelines, said a spokesman forthe state's Department of Public Aid. In the meantime, &quot;Wecontinue to spend Medicaid funds and are eligible for federalmatching dollars.&quot;   (Illinois Health Care Assn. et. al. vs. Philip Bradley, asdirector of the Illinois Dept. of Public Aid, U.S. DistrictCourt, Chicago, 89 C 0849)</TEXT></DOC>
