DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   States should set guidelines for awards indamage suits because juries are blind to the impact their liabilityjudgments have beyond the courtroom, an organization of businessexecutives and educators said today.   ``The benefits are immediate and visible: compensation to anoften tragically injured individual who is present in thecourtroom,'' the Committee for Economic Development said in a176-page report by its Research and Policy Committee.   ``In contrast, the magnitude of the costs and the bearer ofthose costs are largely invisible,'' the CED said.   The committee recommended adoption of statutory guidelines basedon such formulas as replacement of two-thirds of the plaintiff'swages, which it said is roughly full replacement of after-taxearnings.   ``Future wage loss for children could be calculated at themedian annual earnings in the state,'' the panel said. ``Similargeneral principles should be applied for calculating compensationfor medical, rehabilitation, and special educational expenses.''   ``A fundamental flaw of setting the terms of a social insuranceprogram through the courts is that the jury has neither theinformation nor the incentives to weigh the costs of its decisionsagainst the benefits,'' the committee said.   It said one study showed that between 1960 and 1984, the averagejury verdict in California and Cook County, Ill., increased by morethan 300 percent in 1984 dollars after adjustment for inflation.   The CED describes itself as a nonprofit, nonpartisan andnonpolitical educational organization of more than 200 businessexecutives and educators seeking to formulate policies to fostereconomic growth and an improved standard of living.   The panel said the current liability system ``neithereffectively deters nor efficiently compensates'' and the UnitedStates should relay more heavily on alternative methods of disputeresolution.   In addition to increasing legal fees, court awards and insurancecosts, the present system results in indirect cots to Americans inhigher prices, withdrawn goods and services and damagedinternational competitiveness, the study said.   It called for a limit on punitive damages, a uniform federal lawon product liability, and more reliance on regulation to controlenvironmental and chemical hazards.   It said workers' compensation should be revised and made thesole recourse for injuries and diseases of the workplace.   It also called for prohibiting lawsuits when a product complieswith regulation, except in cases of fraud or suppression ofevidence.   It proposed a ban on liability for risks that could not beanticipated at the time the product was manufactured.   ``Punitive damages should be awarded only in cases of willfulmisconduct and should be limited to a modest multiple of thecompensatory award,'' the committee said. It said this wouldpreserve ``incentives for prudent attention to risk'' whileavoiding exposure to ``unpredictable and potentially bankruptingpunitive awards.''</TEXT></DOC>
