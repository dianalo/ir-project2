<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-1000 </DOCNO><TEXT>Recent advances in the physics of nuclei at high angular momentum arereviewed. In particular the new phenomena observed using the latest generationof {gamma}-ray Escape Suppressed Spectrometer (ESS) arrays are discussed.The breath of current high spin nuclear physics is illustrated by anoverview of recent data on quasiparticle alignments, band crossings andband terminations; high spin shell structures; lifetime measurements;magnetic properties; decay of high K isomers. The depth of the subjectis illustrated by a more detailed discussion of both discrete superdeformedstates and also the decline of static pairing effects at high spin. Plansfor new {gamma}-ray spectrometers are mentioned and brief speculationsmade on the future directions of high spin physics.</TEXT></DOC>
