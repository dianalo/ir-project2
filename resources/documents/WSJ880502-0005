The sources said they also believe the terrorist may have been working on behalf of Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi.    Sources said that Yu Kikumura, who has been identified as a member of a terrorist group called the Japanese Red Army, was carrying a map of New York containing some pinholes that U.S. analysts believe mark possible bombing targets, including the United Nations headquarters, the city's crowded garment district, and a USO club near Times Square.    Although the bombs found in Mr. Kikumura's car were relatively crude, the sources said, had one or more of them detonated in a car, or some other confined space, in midtown Manhattan at a busy hour the results could have been devastating. &quot;It doesn't take a lot of sophistication to kill a lot of people in the middle of New York City,&quot; said one official.    U.S. officials sometimes have exaggerated the size and scope of Libya's terrorist activities. The Reagan administration has been trying to unnerve and unseat Col. Gadhafi since 1981, when then-Secretary of State Alexander Haig called him &quot;a cancer.&quot;    And officials stressed that they have no hard evidence implicating Libya in the Naples bombing or in Mr. Kikumura's activities. &quot;We don't know who Mr. Kikumura was working for,&quot; said a senior State Department official. None of the sources were willing to be identifed by name.    However, intelligence analysts said they consider Mr. Kikumura's apparent interest in the USO club, while circumstantial, to be a strong indication that Col. Gadhafi may have paid the JRA terrorist group to attack American targets on the anniversary of the U.S. bombing of Libya on April 14, 1986. Shortly after Mr. Kikumura was arrested, a car bomb exploded outside a USO club in Naples, killing an American servicewoman and four Italians; the leading suspect is another JRA member.    U.S. intelligence sources also said there have been sporadic contacts for years between Libyan intelligence officers and a small JRA faction based in Lebanon. More recently, these officials said, there have been reports of contacts in Lebanon between the JRA and members of the Abu Nidal Palestinian terrorist group, which is headquartered in Libya.    Col. Gadhafi last year began trying to recruit members of the JRA, the Irish Republican Army, the Armenian terrorist group, ASALA, and others, said State Department officials and intelligence sources. Authorities in the African nation of Senegal recently arrested a group of Libyan agents armed with silenced pistols and detonators who apparently were planning to attack a French target. &quot;The Libyans are still practicing terrorism,&quot; contended a senior State Department official.    If they are, however, they are doing so more carefully than in 1986, when Libya's use of diplomatic communications to order attacks on American targets in Western Europe prompted the Reagan administration to retaliate for the bombing of a West Berlin disco. At the time of the Naples bombing, according to a U.S. diplomat, Col. Gadhafi was attending an &quot;anti-terrorism conference&quot; in Libya on the second anniversary of the American attack.    Whether or not Col. Gadhafi was involved in the recent incidents, some U.S. intelligence analysts now believe the JRA is likely to launch a campaign to free Mr. Kikumura, who has been charged with illegal possession of explosives and with entering the U.S. on a stolen passport. The JRA has a pattern of using hijackings and bombings to try to free its members, one official said. </TEXT></DOC>
