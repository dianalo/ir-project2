STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East German media ignored reports of fightsbetween police and would-be emigrants in Dresden, and officialsconcentrated Thursday on dressing East Berlin in banners extolling40 years of ``socialist triumph.''   Witnesses in Dresden said police used clubs and water cannons todisperse thousands of people who hoped to board freedom trainsbound for West Germany with more than 7,000 East Germans who tookrefuge at the West German Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.   ``It was a horrible scene,'' said a Dresden woman, who asked notto be identified for fear of reprisals. ``People were tryingdesperately to get to the platforms and the tracks, but the policeforced them back.''   It was the second violent clash outside Dresden's main railroadstation station in two days.   Official media have turned their attention to celebrationsFriday and Saturday of the communist nation's 40th anniversary, butEast Germans are able to watch reports of the mass emigration onWest German television.   Most coverage of the emigration is devoted to criticizing WestGermany. Neues Deutschland, the Communist Party daily, accused theWest German government of breaking international law by harboringrefugees in its Eastern European missions.   A ranking party ideologue, Otto Reinhold, complained in anewspaper commentary of a ``hateful and slanderous campaign againstEast Germany.''   Reinhold told Western reporters Thursday that East Germanyrejects a dialogue with opposition groups seeking democratic andeconomic reforms.   ``We have no intention to talk with any group whose foundationsare not rooted in socialism,'' he said.   East Germany's aging leaders have rejected political andeconomic reforms similar to those in Poland and Hungary and arenervous about the liberal attitude of Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev, who arrives Friday for the anniversary ceremonies.   Gorbachev is popular with many East Germans, who hope hisinfluence will bring change to their tightly controlled society.   Rolf Henrich of the illegal opposition group New Forum said hehoped Gorbachev would put pressure on East German leader ErichHonecker to implement reforms.   ``It would be a shame if he came only to praise those whosepolicies he's trying to fight at home,'' Henrich said.   He and other opposition leaders harbor little hope that theGorbachev visit will bring change in the near future.   ``It looks like we're going to have to reach rock bottom beforewe work our way up,'' Henrich said.</TEXT></DOC>
