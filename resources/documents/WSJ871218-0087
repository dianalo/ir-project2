London-based Grand Metropolitan, which holds a 19.9% stake in Martell, said in a statement that the Seagram's sale &quot;seems to have been concluded without complying with (French takeover regulations) applicable to the sale of listed shares.&quot; The statement was read to a Martell shareholders' meeting in Paris yesterday.    The big U.K. spirits, food and hotels concern said it was &quot;assessing the validity of this sale&quot; in light of the regulations, which are designed to &quot;allow all shareholders to obtain the best price available.&quot; The company also said it is considering making a higher offer, &quot;in compliance with market procedures.&quot;    A spokesman for Seagram, the big Montreal distiller, said, &quot;We are delighted that the Martell family chose to deal with Seagram and we're very comfortable with our agreement.&quot;    Martell declined to comment on Grand Metropolitan's statement. But a company official said the Seagram agreement, which is subject to French government approval, was otherwise final and couldn't be abrogated. A French Finance Ministry official said the government has just begun to study the agreement.    Seagram said Wednesday it agreed to acquire 40% of Martell for 1.49 billion French francs ($270 million), a friendly transaction that analysts said valued the company at about 3.25 billion French francs. The transaction would boost Seagram's total stake to 52%.    Officials at Grand Metropolitan, which in July acquired 10% of Martell for #30 million and signed an international distribution agreement with the company, were clearly miffed they hadn't been told in advance about the Seagram sale. George Bull, Grand Met's chief executive for wines and spirits, said the company was surprised &quot;our trading partners&quot; decided to sell the controlling stake to Seagram.    The possible fight between the two companies -- by some estimates the world's two largest wines and spirits concerns -- shows the growing competition between beverage concerns to establish international brands and distribution networks. Grand Met said it believed a Seagram's acquisition wouldn't affect its distribution agreement with Martell, which provides Grand Met with important distribution channels in the Far East. Martell said it didn't know how the agreement would be affected if Seagram gained control. </TEXT></DOC>
