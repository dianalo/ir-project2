The estimated weighted-average margins areshown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since our notice of initiation (52 FR 30412), the following events haveoccurred. On September 3, 1987, the ITC determined that there is a reasonableindication that imports of brass sheet and strip from The Netherlands arematerially injuring a U.S. industry (52 FR 34324). On September 10, 1987, a questionnaire was presented to legal counsel forMetallverken Nederland B.V. (MN), which accounts for a substantial portionof Dutch exports to the United States during the period of investigation.On October 28, 1987, we received a questionnaire response from MN. We sentdeficiency letters to the respondent on November 18, 1987 and December18, 1987, and received responses to those letters on December 2, 1987 andJanuary 4, 1988. On December 1, 1987, petitioners requested a postponement of the preliminarydetermination, and on December 4, 1987, in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(A)of the Act and 19 CFR 353.39(b) of the Department of Commerce regulations,we postponed the preliminary determination to January 26, 1988 (52 FR 46805).On January 19, 1988, petitioners requested a further postponement of thepreliminary determination, and on January 22, 1988, in accordance withsection 733(c)(1)(A) of the Act, we postponed the preliminary determinationuntil February 2, 1988 (53 FR 1933). <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. The U.S.Congress is considering legislation to convert the United States to thisHarmonized System (HS). In view of this proposal, we will be providingboth the appropriate Tariff Schedules of the United States annotated (<T3>TSUSA</T3>) item numbers and the appropriate HS item numbers with ourproduct descriptions on a test basis, pending Congressional approval. Aswith the TSUSA, the HS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customspurposes. The written description remains dispositive. We are requesting petitioners to include the appropriate HS item number(s)as well as the <T3>TSUSA</T3> item number(s) in all new petitions filed with the Department.A reference copy of the proposed HS schedule is available for consultationat the Central Records Unit, Room B-099, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14thStreet and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230. Additionally,all Customs officers have reference copies and petitioners may contactthe Import Specialist at their local Customs office to consult the schedule.The products covered by this investigation are brass sheet and strip, otherthan leaded brass and tin brass sheet and strip, currently provided forunder the<T3> TSUSA</T3> item numbers 612.3960, 612.3982, and 612.3986, and currentlyclassifiable under HS item numbers 7409.21.00.50, 7409.21.00.75, 7409.29.00.50,and 7409.29.00.75. The chemical compositions of the products under investigation are currentlydefined in the Cooper Development Association (C.D.A.) 200 series or theUnified Numbering System (U.N.S.) C20000 series. Products whose chemicalcompositions are defined by other C.D.A. or U.N.S. series are not coveredby this investigation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation </ITAG>The period of investigation is February 1, 1987 through July 31, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">Such or Similar Comparisons </ITAG>We have determined that all of the brass sheet and strip under investigationconstitutes the same class or kind of merchandise. In order to select the most similar products, we made comparisons of merchandisebased on grade (chemical composition), gauge, width, coating (tinned ornon-tinned), temper and packed form (coil, cut-to-length or traverse-wound).For merchandise where there were no identical products with which to comparea product sold to the United States, we made adjustments to similar merchandiseto account for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise,in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether sales of brass sheet and strip from The Netherlandsto the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared theUnited States price to the foreign market value as specified below.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>Purchase PriceAs provided in section 772(b) of the Act, we used the purchase price torepresent the United States price for sales of brass sheet and strip madeby MN through related and unrelated sales agents in the United States toan unrelated purchaser prior to importation of the brass into the UnitedStates. The Department determined that purchase price and not exporter'ssales price was the most appropriate indicator of United States price basedon the following elements.1. The merchandise was purchased or agreed to be purchased prior to thedate of importation from the manufacturer or producer of the merchandisefor exportation to the United States.2. The related and unrelated selling agents located in the United Statesacted only as processors of sales-related documentation and as communicationlinks with the unrelated U.S. buyers.3. Rather than entering into the inventory of the related or unrelatedselling agents, the merchandise in question was shipped directly from themanufacturer to the unrelated buyers. Thus, it did not give rise to storageand associated costs on the part of the selling grants or create flexibilityin marketing for the exporter.4. Direct shipments from the manufacturer to the unrelated buyers werethe customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandise betweenthe parties involved.We calculated purchase price based on the packed, delivered, duty paidprices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductionsfrom purchase price, where appropriate, for point-to-point freight, U.S.brokerage and handling, point-to-point insurance, U.S. duty, and year-endrebates in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act.Exporter's Sales PriceWhere the brass sheet and strip were imported into the United States bya related importer before being sold to the first unrelated party, we treatedsuch sales as exporter's sales price sales.To calculate exporter's sales price, we used the packed, delivered or ex-works,duty paid prices of brass sheet and strip to unrelated purchasers in theUnited Strates. We made deductions for point-to-point freight, point-to-pointinsurance, U.S. duty, and U.S. brokerage and handling.We made deductions under andSection; 353.10(e)(2) of our regulations fordirect and indirect selling expenses incurred by or for the exporter inselling brass sheet and strip in the United States. Indirect selling expenseswere comprised of indirect selling expenses incurred outside the U.S.,U.S. indirect selling expenses of the related reseller in the U.S., andinventory carrying costs. U.S. credit was deducted as a direct sellingexpense. Pursuant to andSection; 353.10(e)(1) of our regulations, we alsodeducted, where appropriate, commissions paid to unrelated parties. Thetotal of the indirect expenses and commissions formed the cap for the allowablehome market indirect selling expenses offset under andSection; 353.15(c)of our regulations.For exporter's sales price sales involving further manufacturing, pursuantto andSection; 353.10(e)(3) of our regulations, we deducted all value addedto the subject merchandise in the United States plus a proportional amountof the profit or loss on the U.S. sale that was attributable to furthermanufacturing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on the packed, delivered or ex-works prices to unrelated customersin the home market. We made deductions from the home market price, whereappropriate, for inland freight and insurance, warranty expenses, quantitydiscounts, and scrap handling expenses. Where appropriate, we made additionsto the home market price for quantity and scrap extras.In order to adjust for differences in packing between the U.S. and homemarkets, we deducted the home market packing cost from the foreign marketvalue and added all U.S. packing costs.We made further adjustments to the home market price to account for differencesin the physical characteristics of the merchandise in accordance with section773(a)(4)(C) of the Act.Where U.S. price was based on purchase price, we made adjustments underandSection; 353.15 of our regulations for differences in credit expensesin the U.S. and home market. We offset commissions paid on U.S. pruchaseprice sales with indirect selling expenses in the home market, in accordancewith andSection; 353.15(c) of our regulations.Where U.S. price was based on exporter's sales price, we made a deductionfrom home market prices for credit expenses in the home market. We alsodeducted indirect selling expenses in the home market to offset UnitedStates selling expenses, in accordance with andSection; 353.15(c) of ourregulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion</ITAG>For comparisons involving purchase price transactions, we made currencyconversions in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(1). For comparisons involvingexporter's sales price transactions, we used the official exchange ratesin effect on the dates of sale, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) ofthe Act, as amended by section 615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984.All currency conversions were made at the rates certified by the FederalReserve Bank.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>We will verify the information used in making our final determination inaccordance with section 776(a) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with section 733(d) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of brass sheet andstrip from the Netherlands that are entered or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption, on or after the date of publication of this notice inthe <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The U.S. Custom Service shall require a cashdeposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amounts by which theforeign market value of brass sheet and strip from the Netherlands exceedsthe United States price as shown below.
