Box 85, Tremont, Pennsylvania 17981 hasfiled a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1400 (hoistingequipment; general) to its Orchard Vein Slope (I.D. No. 36-07864) locatedin Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petition if filed under section101(c) of the Safety and Health Act of 1977. A summary of the petitioner's statements follows: 1. The petition concerns the requirement that cages, platforms or otherdevices which are used to transport persons in shafts and slopes be equippedwith safety catches or other approved devices that act quickly and effectivelyin an emergency. 2. Effective safety catches or devices are not available for the conveyancesused on the steeply pitching and undulating slopes with numerous curvesand knuckles in the main haulage slopes of this anthracite mine. 3. If ``makeshift'' safety devices are installed they would activate onknuckles and curves when no emergency exists and cause a tumbling effecton the conveyance. 4. As an alternate method, petitioner proposes to operate the man cageor steel gunboat with secondary safety connections securely fastened aroundthe gunboat, and to the hoisting rope above the main connecting device.The hoisting ropes would have a factor of safety in excess of the designfactor as determined by the formula specified in the American NationalStandard for Wire Rope for Mines. 5. Petitioner states that the proposed alternate method will provide thesame degree of safety for the miners affected as that afforded by the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
