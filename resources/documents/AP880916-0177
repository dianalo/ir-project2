King Mswati III, the world's youngest monarch, satexpressionless as the pope said God intended each husband to haveone wife.   The pope arrived at the capital's national stadium in hispopemobile escorted by spear-carrying warriors. He spoke from analtar topped by a turret holding a soldier with a rifle andbinoculars. A cross on the structure was stamped with a spear,shield and war ax.   ``Christians find that a monogamous marital union provides thefoundation upon which to build a stable family in accordance withthe original plan of God for marriage,'' the pope told a crowd ofabout 10,000 in the national stadium.   ``Hence, any forms of disregard for the equal dignity of men andwomen must be seen as serious contradiction of the truth thatChrist, the king of peace, brought into the world,'' he said.   Vatican sources said John Paul was warned by local prelates totread carefully before addressing the issue of polygamy, but hewent ahead anyway.   An estimated 70,000 of Swaziland's people _ roughly 10 percentof the population _ are Catholics, but the king is not one of them.   Mswati has never issued any statement on his religious beliefs.His father supported freedom of religion and said he was a memberof all religions. Mswati is believed to follow in the sametradition, but that has never been confirmed.   Later Friday, the pope went on to Mozambique, the last stop on a10-day visit of southern Africa that also included Zimbabwe,Botswana and Lesotho. He urged Mozambique's Marxist government tonegotiate with rightist rebels.   Swaziland, a stable country of 700,000 people wedged betweenSouth Africa and Mozambique, is a dual monarchy under the king,offically known as the Lion, and a queen mother called the GreatShe Elephant.   Polygamy is no longer practiced extensively in Swaziland, but itis a tradition in the royal family.   Mswati's father, King Sobhuza II, had more than 50 wives and atleast 68 children during his 60-year reign, which ended with hisdeath in 1982.   Also attending the Mass were the queen mother and the formerqueen regent who briefly ruled the country after Sobhuza's death.   The Mass was unusual from the start. John Paul's open-toppedpopemobile was driven in the wrong direction after it circled oncearound the track at the stadium. The warrior escorts and Vaticansecurity men expressed dismay when the popemobile started drivingout the gate.   After driving back into the stadium, the pope slipped off aplatform onto the soggy field and climbed back onto the altar.   Then his celebration of the Mass was interrupted by the arrivalof the young king, who rolled into the stadium in a Lincolnlimousine to welcoming whistles from the crowd.   Later, the pope was kept waiting for 20 minutes inside hisMercedes at the doors of royal palace until the king's limousinewas moved from the driveway.   After the delay, John Paul chatted with the king and othermembers of the royal family for 10 minutes. The meeting had beenscheduled for 30 minutes.   As they spoke and exchanged gifts inside the palace, securitymen crawled on the floor in order not to disturb the view of theking and the pope.   During his three other African trips, John Paul frequentlycondemned polygamy, marital infidelity and promiscuity.   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire was hurriedly married a fewdays before the pope visited in 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
