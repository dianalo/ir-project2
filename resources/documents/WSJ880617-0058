Gingerly.    Last month, the trustees of Stanford University issued a news release announcing a search to replace H. Glenn Campbell as director of Stanford's Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank. The lengthy statement didn't mention that Mr. Campbell, who turns Stanford's &quot;customary&quot; retirement age of 65 next year, doesn't want to step down. Instead, it publicized a package of retirement benefits that Stanford is &quot;prepared&quot; to grant the 28-year director, including retention of his office.    The peculiar announcement reflects the thicket of politics, principles and money that has ensnared the Hoover Institution in controversy for years. As Hoover's proud, outspoken leader, Mr. Campbell has come to symbolize the think tank's close identification with the Reagan administration and its policies, an identification that many at Stanford find repugnant and inappropriate.    Yet until now, Mr. Campbell, who has built up Hoover's endowment to roughly $300 million, was thought invulnerable. Even Stanford's president, Donald Kennedy, who is widely known to dislike Mr. Campbell, couldn't reign in the feisty administrator, professors say.    &quot;This is obviously a great feather in Kennedy's cap, if it goes through without trouble,&quot; says Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and a senior research fellow at Hoover.    That's a big &quot;if.&quot; Mr. Campbell vows to contest his forced retirement, and he enjoys widespread support among Hoover's scholars and Board of Overseers, a panel of conservatives set up by Herbert Hoover.    &quot;He gets better every day, in terms of running this place,&quot; says Martin Anderson, a former Reagan domestic-policy coordinator and a Hoover senior fellow.    Indeed, the attempt to oust Mr. Campbell may boomerang on Mr. Kennedy, whose background as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration for the Carter administration indicates a more liberal political orientation than Hoover's director has. For one thing, Stanford doesn't really have any mandatory retirement age, leaving the school open to an age-discrimination suit by Mr. Campbell. Some liberal professors also fear that Mr. Campbell's replacement would be more diplomatic and suave, and therefore more effective in championing Hoover's causes.    Moreover, if the Hoover Overseers get their way, the flap could make Hoover even more independent of Stanford. They recently gave Stanford a list of demands they want met before they'll agree to support Mr. Campbell's forced retirement.    To Mr. Campbell, more is at stake than a job. Hand-picked by Mr. Hoover in 1960, he has fought repeated battles against professors and students who think Hoover should submit to the same faculty-appointment and budgetary processes as the rest of Stanford. He sees his ouster as the latest attempt to undermine Hoover's autonomy and subvert its purpose, articulated by Mr. Hoover: &quot;To demonstrate the evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx.&quot;    Hoover does have its foes. Last month, anti-Hoover activists submitted a petition to Stanford's faculty senate, signed by 57 professors, calling on the trustees to bring Hoover under &quot;normal academic governance.&quot;    As it stands now, a 1959 agreement between Mr. Hoover and Stanford empowers the Hoover director to make all appointments without input from the faculty.    &quot;Our image is inextricably linked with their activities, and that's dangerous for Stanford,&quot; says John F. Manley, professor of political science. &quot;A university is supposed to be non-partisan.&quot;    Hoover researchers retort that Stanford's liberal arts professors are hardly non-partisan. Mr. Manley, for example, coedited a collection of essays last year that question the democratic motives of the constitutional framers. &quot;The best way to explain the American Constitution is through a class analysis,&quot; he says.    That's little solace to Mr. Campbell. He says he wanted to retire two years ago, but Stanford reneged on promises to reaffirm its agreements granting Hoover's autonomy. Now, he fears a recurrence of the spring of 1960, when Stanford, embarrassed after Hoover's anti-Marxist mission statement came to light, backed down on commitments to uphold Hoover's independence.    It took a severe dropoff in donations, and a threat by Mr. Hoover to move his archives elsewhere, before Stanford guaranteed the insitution's autonomy.    Wrote the former president, in 1961: &quot;The left-wing faculty in Stanford University is constantly conspiring to get control of the Hoover Institution. In their communist-pattern operations, they have submitted me to great indignities and anxieties, and I have little confidence of its independence in the future.&quot;    Mr. Campbell has even less. </TEXT></DOC>
