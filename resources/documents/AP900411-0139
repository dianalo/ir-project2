Gorbachev on Wednesday and heard the Sovietpresident's latest assessment of how the Kremlin's reforms wereprogressing.   Gorbachev told the delegation that Soviet society ``is leavingthe rallying stage and is becoming involved in real deeds,'' theSoviet news agency Tass reported.   ``Availing ourselves of these sentiments, we want to radicalizethe process of reforms,'' Tass quoted him as saying.   Gorbachev is to meet Saturday with his major advisory bodies tomake final decisions on the program of radical economic reform hehas been promising since becoming president with greatly expandedpowers last month.   The World Media Conference, meeting for the first time inMoscow, gathered for a three-day symposium on Tuesday to discussthe impact of political change in the Soviet Union on globalcommunications.   About 500 delegates from 60 countries, including more than 40former heads of state, attended the opening of the associationfounded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon to encourage East-Westcommunication in politics, economics and the environment.   Gorbachev told conference participants Wednesday that ``we areonly at the beginning of the process of shaping a new worldorder,'' Tass said.   He called the media conference a ``very important element ofcooperation,'' the agency said.   Much of Wednesday's discussions focused on ecology.   Two of the Soviet Union's best known environmental figuresspoke: Nikolai Vorontsov, chief of the government's committee onthe environment, and Alexei Yablokov, a prominent ecologist who hashelped publicize frightening facts about pollution in the SovietUnion.   Yablokov proposed a program of urgent ecological measures tohelp coordinate environmental laws around the world and requireeach country to preserve endangered species, Tass reported.   Moon said in his opening remarks Tuesday that it was perestroikathat made it possible for the association to hold its meeting inthe Soviet capital.   ``I feel there is no place more appropriate to gather for thesediscussions than right here in the Soviet Union,'' Moon said.</TEXT></DOC>
