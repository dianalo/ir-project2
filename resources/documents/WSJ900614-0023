Oil-supply reports figured prominently in the volatiletrading.</LP><TEXT>   Petroleum futures were generally higher by the end of thetrading day. But a bearish weekly report from the AmericanPetroleum Institute, released late Tuesday after trading hadclosed, cut short the sizzling rally that had sent gasolineand crude oil futures surging. The report showed U.S.inventories of crude oil climbed nearly 1.3 million barrelslast week while those for gasoline rose 500,000 barrelsinstead of declining as had been anticipated.   As a result of the statistics, futures prices of bothcrude oil and gasoline were driven down at the opening oftrading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday. TheJuly gasoline contract quickly lost about half itsday-earlier surge of 2.62 cents a gallon, and July crudepromptly dropped 34 cents a barrel.   But then, after prices had steadied at the lower level,rumors began circulating late in the day that output by theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is droppingfaster than had been anticipated. One report had productiondown 700,000 barrels a day to 22.9 million barrels daily forthe first half of June.   That helped revive petroleum futures prices in both theU.S. and Europe. Feverish buying in the last two hours oftrading on London's International Petroleum Exchange reverseda slide in the Brent blend crude. The July contract closedslightly higher.   The turnabout was even more pronounced on the New YorkMercantile Exchange. July crude rebounded from a low of$17.17 a barrel to settle at $17.58, up seven cents for theday. July gasoline closed 0.35 cent a gallon higher to settleat 58.85 cents.   Some oil analysts were skeptical that OPEC production forthe first half of the month could yet be estimatedaccurately. Still, various monitors of OPEC production areestimating that production is declining further in June afterthe slight drop in May.   &quot;We are getting figures around 23.3 million {barrels aday}, slightly lower than the 23.5 million for May,&quot; saidAntonio M. Szabo, president of Bonner andamp; Moore ManagementScience, Houston. However, he cited the cuts being made inpricing formulas for July crude sales by several OPEC membersas more than offsetting the production decline so far as oilmarkets are concerned. &quot;The main issue in OPEC is no longervolume, it's price,&quot; he said.   In a separate development concerning oil markets, theLondon-based International Petroleum Exchange, or IPE, andthe Singapore International Monetary Exchange, or Simex,agreed to cooperate on development of their individual sour(high sulfur) crude oil futures contracts. The exchangesjointly announced that their specifications of the contractfor Dubai, the Middle East benchmark for the sour crudes,will be identical.   Contracts based on the Dubai crude will begin trading onthe Simex next Thursday and on the IPE July 19.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices declined, with gold andsilver dropping to new life-of-contract lows. August-deliverygold ended with a loss of $4 an ounce at $355.10 aftertrading at a new low of $353.90. July silver traded to a newlow of $4.930 an ounce before barely recovering to end at$4.933, down 10.7 cents. July platinum was off $8.20 an ounceto $481.20. Selling of gold bullion in Hong Kong by Japaneseinvestors was the principal weakening factor, according toone analyst. He noted that a decline in May U.S. retailsales, particularly in durable goods, as well as a drop inearly June U.S. auto sales were also depressants because theytended to indicate a recessionary rather than an inflationarytrend, which would create demand for precious metals as ahedge. The dollar was down against foreign currencies, but ithad no discernible impact on precious metals, he said. Goldmay get very little support from investors during the comingmonths, the analyst said, because demand for bullion usuallyslackens in both Europe and the Far East during the summervacation period.                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn futures contractsslumped amid profit-taking by traders. Most analysts hadexpected prices to rise yesterday in the wake of theAgriculture Department's decision after the close of tradingTuesday to raise by 50 million bushels its estimate of U.S.corn exports through the fall. But the rally Tuesday ofseveral corn futures contracts to life-of-contract highprices apparently set the stage for the wave ofprofit-taking. Prices of most wheat and soybean futurescontracts also slipped slightly on a lack of news directlyinvolving U.S. markets. The Soviet Union was rumored to havepurchased as much as 500,000 metric tons of South Americansoybean meal and as much as one million metric tons of wheatfrom Western Europe.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices fell back from Tuesday's rally onselling prompted by weak economic reports. The July deliverydropped one cent a pound to $1.0960. U.S. retail salesdecreased 0.7% in May, the Commerce Department reported.April's retail sales were also revised downward to show adrop of 0.9% from 0.6% earlier. The May decline was greaterthan economists had expected. Sales of durable goods in Mayfell 1.1% after dropping 1.7% in April. Auto sales in Maydecreased 0.6% after falling 1.6% in April, the CommerceDepartment said. Domestic auto sales are estimated to havereached a 6.3 million unit seasonally adjusted annual rate inearly June, Dow Jones News Service reported. Industryanalysts had generally expected an annual rate of about 6.6million units in the June 1-10 period, the report said. TheCommerce Department yesterday said that U.S. privately ownedhousing units completed during April were down 5.9% fromMarch and down 16.3% from a year earlier. The number of unitsunder construction at the end of April were down 0.6% fromthe previous month, the department said. Durable goodsgenerally, and the automobile and housing industries inparticular, are significant users of copper and any weaknessin them portends a decreased consumption of copper.</TEXT></DOC>
