A permanent instrumentation system consisting of 11 accelerometerswas installed to monitor the dynamic behaviour of the platform duringoperation. Based on accelerometer data collected during the first yearafter installation, natural periods, mode shapes and damping have beenidentified. This paper compares the measured dynamic behaviour of theplatform with the behaviour predicted by analytical calculations performedat the design stage. From this it appears that the design assumptionshave been on the safe side with respect to the global dynamic behaviourof the platform. Further, new analytical calculations were performed,based on the &quot;as built&quot; documentation together with the latest knowledgeabout the structural and geotechnical parameters. The results from theseanalyses agree fairly well with the measured behaviour of the platform.It is shown how an even better agreement can be obtained through tuningthe structural stiffness and the soil stiffness.</TEXT></DOC>
