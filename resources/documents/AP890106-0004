(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A high school canceled classes for asecond day Thursday after a custodian was diagnosed withLegionnaires' disease and another custodian began showing symptomsof the disease.   Test results to determine if the second custodian at HunterdonCentral Regional High School has the disease should be available inabout five days, said Marilyn Riley, state Health Departmentspokeswoman.   The bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease is transmittedthrough the air from vaporized water, Ms. Riley said. Healthofficials inspected the building Thursday for bacteria sources.Samples of water will be taken Friday and Sunday from the school,she said.   ``Our feeling is, if we're going to have to run a disruptedschool day because of the testing, we may as well take one more dayoff,'' said district spokesman Willard Richard. ``We're alsoconcerned about any possible health hazard. We don't want to betaking chances.''   A 33-year-old male custodian, who officials have declined toidentify, was diagnosed with Legionnaires' in December. He wasresponding to treatment at Warren Hospital in Phillipsburg and wasexpected to be released soon, Ms. Riley said. He was admitted to thehospital Dec. 18.   A 44-year-old custodian at the school became sick Jan. 2 withpneumonia and a high fever. He also was responding to therapy anddoing well in Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington, she said.   Legionnaires' disease is fatal about in 15 percent to 20 percentof confirmed cases, said Robert Breiman, a medical epidemiologist atthe Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. It is usuallysuccessfully treated with antibiotics.   The source of Legionnaires' disease would be easier to find ifthe second custodian has the disease, but it would not confirm thatthe bacteria was at the school because the men could have been in acommon place other than the school when they contracted thebacteria, Breiman said.   If only the one case is confirmed, it will be harder to determineits source, he said.   About 1,850 students from Flemington, Readington, Delaware,Raritan and East Amwell townships attend the school.   People under 20 years old usually are not affected by thebacteria, called legionella pneumophila, Breiman said. It mostcommonly strikes elderly people and those whose immune systems areweakened, he said.   Legionnaires' disease was named from an outbreak at thePennsylvania American Legion convention at the Bellevue-StratfordHotel in Philadelphia in July 1976. Thirty-four people _ 29Legionnaires or family members and five other people who had beennear the hotel _ eventually died of the disease.   About 800 to 1,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease are reported tothe center each year, Breiman said. There is no vaccine, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
