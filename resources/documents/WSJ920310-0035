A federal judge in San Jose, Calif., granted TexasInstruments' request to be allowed to intervene in the case,in which Intel alleges that Chips andamp; Technologies illegallyuses Intel technologies in chips that mimic Intel's popularmicroprocessors.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, the judge denied Intel's request thatChips andamp; Technologies be restrained from transferring to othercompanies the technologies embedded in its clones of Intel'schips.   By allowing Dallas-based Texas Instruments into the legalbattle, the judge has granted a powerful legal ally to Chipsandamp; Technologies, whose executives have said its survivaldepends on the success of its Intel clones. Intel, which hasprofited handsomely from its dominance of the market formicroprocessors, has been tenacious in its legal battlesagainst companies that try to horn in on that market byproducing chips that mimic its own.   Texas Instruments, in effect, will be helping defend Chipsandamp; Technologies, which chose the Dallas company as amanufacturer in part because the company is known for itslegal muscle. Texas Instruments has an agreement with Chips andamp;Technologies to make that company's chips that are compatiblewith Intel's 386 and 387 microprocessors. A Texas Instrumentsspokesman said that &quot;We asked that we be allowed toparticipate in the proceedings so we can protect our rightsand interests.&quot;   Chips andamp; Technologies last fall introduced its family ofchips that are compatible with Intel's 386 microprocessors,which are the most popular &quot;brains&quot; of personal computers.Chips andamp; Technologies maintains it spent three years and $50million reverse-engineering the chips specifically to avoidinfringements on Intel's patents and copyrights.   Intel, of Santa Clara, Calif., unexpectedly filed suitagainst Chips andamp; Technologies last month despite being inprivate settlement negotiations with the San Jose, Calif.,chip maker. As part of the suit, Intel asked the federaljudge to issue a temporary restraining order against Chips andamp;Technologies, which could have affected Texas Instruments'ability to continue making chips for the company.   Texas Instruments argues that it has patentcross-licensing agreements with Intel that give the Dallascompany the patent rights to Intel's microprocessors andother products. Under the deal, Texas Instruments &quot;islicensed to make, have made, use, lease, sell and otherwisedispose of certain products,&quot; said the Texas Instrumentsspokesman. &quot;We believe our commitment to Chips is consistentwith our agreement with Intel.&quot;   Intel lawyer Thomas Dunlap, criticizing Texas Instrumentsfor joining the fray, said that &quot;it's somewhat surprisingthat they've been the defender of intellectual property andnow they come in and defend an infringer.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
