U.S. District Judge Richard Owen on Monday threw out a subpoenato call Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to the stand.   Wallach's attorney, Gary Naftalis, said he wanted to questionThornburgh about an internal Justice Department report that faultedformer Attorney General Edwin Meese III, a defense witness.   The report, which was issued in January, said Meese had violatedcodes of ethics in his efforts to help Wallach in an ill-fated,Mideast oil pipeline proposal and to assist him with the WedtechCorp.   Wedtech, once a small machine shop in the South Bronx, grew intoa $100 million government contractor through a special SmallBusiness Administration program that set aside contracts withoutcompetitive bidding for minority-controlled companies.   Evidence at earlier trials has shown that Wedtech continued toreceive the no-bid contracts through a series of bribe schemes evenafter it ceased to be a minority-owned company.   Wallach, a San Francisco attorney who is a longtime friend ofMeese, is charged with two others in a 21-count racketeeringindictment with extracting almost $2 million in illegal payoffs andpayments from Wedtech, including $525,000 in alleged bribes toWallach to influence Meese and other government officials.   Meese was asked about the report when he was cross-examined byAssistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss last Thursday.   Weiss submitted into evidence a press release that statedThornburgh had accepted the report after Meese testified thatThornburgh had not adopted the report's findings.   Naftalis argued that Weiss had incorrectly stated that Thornburghhad ``adopted'' the findings of the department's Office ofProfessional Conduct.   According to Naftalis, Thornburgh had in fact distanced himselffrom the report and had delayed its release so Meese and his lawyerscould prepare a rebuttal, made public on the same day.   Naftalis said Weiss tried to make it look like Meese had lied tothe jury and that he needed to question Thornburgh to set the recordstraight.   Weiss opposed the subpoena and said Thornburgh's testimony wouldbe irrelevant.   The other defendants are W. Franklyn Chinn, 47, a former Wedtechboard member and onetime Meese financial adviser, and a businessassociate of theirs, R. Kent London.</TEXT></DOC>
