I followed directions in my garden book but they all died.Is there a particular month to plant or a technique to use to root theseplants? Should I try again this spring?;    Is there a better way to propagateMyrtus?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  IT'S ROOTING TIME FOR NEW DWARF MYRTLE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Mailbag  </MEMO><TEXT>     -- J.G., Los Altos;    A Myrtus communis compacta, dwarf Myrtle, is bestpropagated from softwood cuttings taken in the early spring when new growthhas just started. Make your cuttings four to five inches long using a sharpknife to prevent damaging the stems. Strip all but the top cluster of leaves.Dip the ends in a rooting hormone powder such as Rootone.;    Use a mix of 50percent vermiculite and 50 percent perlite or sharp sand for your rootingmedium. Make sure the medium is wet before inserting your treated cuttings.Stick a knife into the mixture, spreading it apart and leaving a narrowtrench. Carefully place the cutting into the trench leaving the top exposed.Making this little trench ensures that inserting the cutting does not injurethe cut stem or that the rooting hormone is wiped off. Firm the medium aroundthe cuttings after insertion and water thoroughly.;    Cover your rooting boxwith a pane of glass or clear plastic and place in a spot with strong lightbut not direct sunshine. Keep the rooting medium moist. If possible place asource of heat under the rooting bed or box. Heating cables are available oruse a 60-watt light globe. This will help root plants quickly. Heating cablesare available from Park Seed Co., Greenwood, S.C. 29647-0001 (write for freecatalog) or from some local hardware stores.;    Q I have a clipping showingwhat is called a Hummingbird vine or Campsis radicans. It looks like the oldTrumpet vine I grew in the Midwest. It's a fast-growing vine and that's what Ineed. Is this the same thing and will it grow well here in Santa Cruz?;    --M.S., Soquel;    A Campsis radicans is indeed the old-fashioned Trumpet vine.It is fast growing, blooming in late summer with three-inch, orange flowers inclusters. It is a vigorous vine, suckering freely, and can become somewhatinvasive.;    Be aware that plants sent by mail-order are often shippedbare-root or with sawdust around the roots and sent during East Coast spring.This means that the plant arrives long after our warm weather is here.Sometimes plants dry out too much in the shipping and don't make it.;    Youmight call around to the nurseries in your area and see if they carry thevine. It is also sold under the name Bignonia radicans or Trumpet Creeper.;   Q I am looking for information on the planting, growing and care of palmtrees. Can you tell me where I can get such information?;    -- E.W.,Sunnyvale;    A Your best bet would be to contact the International PalmSociety, P.O. Box 368, Lawrence, Kan. 66044. This very active organizationpublishes books, pamphlets, holds conventions, sells seeds and plants, holdsexhibits and offers trips and tours. There are several members in this areaand there is a palmetum at Lakeside Park Garden Center, 555 Bellvue Ave.,Oakland, next to Lake Merritt.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Bob Chapman column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910307  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  550  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday March 7, 199100067084,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
