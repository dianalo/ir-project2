The move came a day after Eastern insisted such a step remained alast resort in the airline's effort to endure the strike, which hadstrong support from pilots and flight attendants and was costingEastern an estimated $4 million a day.   Eastern, filing under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here,listed more than $4.5 billion in net assets, $3.39 billion inliabilities and 15,696 creditors. The filing is designed to giveEastern a reprieve from debts while it tries to restructure andextricate itself from the worst crisis in its 60-year history.   Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo blamed ``the damage that has beencaused by the pilots union.'' He and Eastern President Phil Bakesinsisted they intend to restore the airline in bankruptcy court,though in a smaller form.   ``We tried mightily to keep Eastern from bankruptcy,'' Bakes saidat a news conference. ``We intend to operate our airline: make nomistake about that.''   Bakes said Eastern faces a ``cash crisis that can only be avertedand stabilized by'' turning to the bankruptcy court.   Union leaders denounced Lorenzo as a ``robber baron.'' Machinistscalled for a public boycott of Eastern's sister airline,Continental, set up pickets against Continental in Houston, and saidthey would oppose Eastern's reorganization plan and any sale ofassets.   Lorenzo and Bakes pledged that all creditors would be paid infull; shareholders would receive ``fair value''; passengers would beprotected, and as many employees as possible would return to work.Eastern had 31,200 employees before the strike.   John Peterpaul, a Machinists vice president, said Eastern filedfor bankruptcy on payday ``in a spiteful attempt to deny Easternworkers their last paycheck earned before the strike.'' Paycheckswere frozen by the move.   Eastern encouraged its ticket-holders to redeem their ticketswith other carriers, and failing that, to mail them in for refunds.Continental said it would accept Eastern tickets at full value.   As of Thursday, Other carriers such as Braniff and TWA refused tohonor Eastern tickets, while some carriers accepted them, subject tosuch ``significant restrictions'' as stand-by seats only forfull-price tickets.   John Bavis, head of the Eastern pilots union, said managementcontinued calling pilots at home in hopes some will return to work.He said the effort would fail.   Henry Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, saidhe hoped the move meant Lorenzo is ``finished'' at Eastern.   The company, which has a staggering $2.5 billion in debt, hasadmitted it was taken by surprise when most of the 3,600 Easternpilots honored Machinists' picket lines, forcing Miami-based Easternto shut down nearly all operations Monday and lay off 9,500non-union employees.   Eastern, running just 4 percent of its flights with a crew of1,500, is losing $4 million a day, Bakes said. Before the 8,500Machinists struck Saturday in a dispute over concessions, losseswere pegged at $1 million daily.   Union leaders long have said they believe Lorenzo wants to breakthem and tear Eastern apart. But Lorenzo would have a tougher timeimposing lower wages at Eastern than he did when he reorganizedContinental in 1983. Congress amended bankruptcy law in 1984 torequire bankrupt companies to negotiate with unions and proveeconomic necessity before abrogating contracts.   Lorenzo stressed the filing covered only Eastern and not itsparent Texas Air Corp., of which he is chairman. But on Thursday,Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, filed a bill to allow Easterncreditors to collect from the parent company.   ``This bill would prevent Frank Lorenzo and any other airlinebuccaneers from using bankruptcy to escape their creditors anddestroy their workers,'' Metzenbaum said.   ``Make no mistake about it. Continental is on strike now,''Eastern Machinists leader Charles E. Bryan said as his memberscheered. ``There's never been a more classic example of a robberbaron. ... Anytime anyone buys a ticket on Continental, they'remaking a contribution to treachery ... to atrocity ... to evil.''   At a news conference in New York, Lorenzo noted the animosityunion leaders have expressed toward him and said it had ``hurt myfamily and me.''   ``But I suggest that the intensive focus on a single person doesa real gross injustice to the real issues that are at stake inairline deregulation and, indeed, in our business climate today,''he said.   Bakes and Lorenzo avoided specific comment on the news thatLorenzo rival Carl Icahn had been asked by Eastern strikers toconsider a buyout of Eastern.   The Chapter 11 filing would not prevent such a takeover but wouldforce approval by the bankruptcy court as well as creditors, makingsuch a transaction cumbersome. Unions would also have a say.   Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines, said Wednesday he wouldconsider requests to acquire Eastern only if Eastern allowed thenegotiations.   The Machinists helped Icahn snatch TWA in 1985 despite Lorenzo'scompeting bid. Icahn mulled a bid for Eastern last fall, but talksfaltered when he asked for up to $300 million in concessions fromits union in exchange for a stake in the company.   Bakes said Eastern's immediate focus will be on the fewoperations it has retained _ its Northeast shuttle service, andflights to South America.   As pilots become available, Eastern plans to ``prudently butunmistakably'' put more planes into the air, Bakes added.   Bankruptcy court must approve any ticket refunds to passengers.The court considers ticket holders as unsecured creditors who mustwait in line behind secured creditors, who receive higher preference.   Among other developments:   _ The Machinists said in Washington that the union, along withthe pilots union and the Transport Workers Union, which representsflight attendants, would draft a reorganization plan to submit tobankruptcy court next week. No details were given.   _ Bakes said the court action would not affect a pending $365million sale of the Northeast shuttle to New York developer DonaldTrump.   _ In New York, a federal judge heard arguments but withheldruling on whether to extend a ban against commuter rail sympathystrikes, which could disrupt travel for more than 320,000 people inthe New York area. A federal appeals court in Philadelphia refusedto overturn a ban on sympathy strikes at commuter railroads there.   _ In Washington, the House Public Works Committee approvedlegislation aimed at pushing President Bush into the strike byforcing appointment of an emergency board. The legislation goes tothe House, where passage is likely. But the Bush administration hasthreatened to veto it, and it may not even make it out of the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
