We have him somewhere in our material,''said Olvebro, the third detective to lead the hunt since Palme wasassassinated two years ago.   But despite 16,000 tips and a $8.3 million reward, policeacknowledge they don't know much more about the killer or hismotive than when they began.   Olvebro, who took over the investigation earlier this month, isleading the 35 detectives working full-time on the case. At onepoint there were 300.   The most intensive investigation in Swedish history has producedseveral by-products: books, plays, libel suits and, according to apolice spokesman, the solution to several other crimes, includingat least one unrelated murder. He refused to elaborate.   Palme, a four-term premier, was killed in downtown Stockholm ona midnight walk home from a movie with his wife, Lisbet, on Feb.28, 1986. She was grazed by a bullet.   He was the first Swedish leader to die violently in twocenturies. The assassination rocked the self-image of a nation thattreasures its soft-spoken civility and non-violent character.   Mourners erected a foot-high mound of flowers on the sidewalkhours after he died. It has been replenished daily, chiefly withred roses, the symbol of his Social Democratic Party, and the spothas become a bizarre tourist attraction.   The trauma of the killing is fading, judging by the organizedevents marking the anniversary. Last year, 10,000 Swedes held atorch-lit march, but this year the only planned commemoration is bya few party members holding banners in salute on the site.   Palme was a high-profile figure at home and abroad. He was anupper-class boy turned Socialist and an international disarmamentactivist who was often perceived as having a pro-Soviet slant.   ``A political murder or the murder of a politician is alwaysmore difficult to solve,'' said Ingvar Eriksson, spokesman for theinvestigating team.   The list of suspects ranges from right-wing extremists whoobjected to Palme's socialism to Kurdish terrorists, said to beoutraged at Sweden's refusal to grant refugee status to one oftheir leaders.   The ousted president of Iran, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, claimed thekilling was ordered by the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeinibecause Palme had discovered and tried to stop Swedish armssmuggling to Iran. Bani-Sadr offered no evidence to support hisclaim.   Two policemen are suing a Swedish television producer forwriting in a book that he saw them acting suspiciously immediatelyafter the killing. The officers were cleared by a parliamentarycommission.   One man who was arrested for one week in 1986 won $30,000 indamages from a major daily after it published his name and picture.Under Swedish press laws, suspects cannot be identified until theirconviction.   The same man was detained again a few weeks ago and questionedfor two days. This time, no paper published his name.   Olvebro's predecessor, Detective Superintendent Inge Reneborg,said when he left the investigation last month that he believed thekilling was the work of an organization rather than an individual.   Reneborg left to go into retirement. The first chiefinvestigator, Hans Holmer, was forced to step down when the casefoundered after a year.   Official reports have charged that the police work was sloppyduring the crucial first 12 hours after the killing, and that theprobe was hampered by Holmer's refusal to let prosecutors lead thechase.   Hoping to find a defector among those involved in the killing,the government raised the reward tenfold last November, advertisingthe prize in the international press.   Spokesman Eriksson said one source of tips in the case has beenthe Swedish underworld, which found the heat too intense from thesearch for the killer.   Despite frustrations, Eriksson said, the search for the killerwill go on, if necessary, for another 23 years until the statute oflimitations takes effect.</TEXT></DOC>
