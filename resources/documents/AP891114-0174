Stoney Harrison, 25, was arrested late Monday at a girlfriend'shome after a 10-hour citywide manhunt, police said. He wasarraigned Tuesday evening on four counts of second degree murderand returned to jail.   Two of the murder counts charged him with the deaths of the twodetectives and the other two with felony murder, or murder duringthe furtherance of a crime _ which was escape. He also was chargedwith first-degree escape and second-degree criminal possession of aweapon.   The maximum penalty for murder in New York is 25 years to life.   Harrison had been taken from jail to the Queens districtattorney's office Monday to take a lie detector test and discuss aplea bargain.   Later, a series of mistakes allowed Harrison to steal a loadedgun and surprise the two officers while they were returning him tothe city's jail complex on Rikers Island, authorities said Tuesday.   ``If you make a mistake in this business, it can have terribleresults. ... These two detectives got careless for a minute or twoand it cost them their lives,'' Police Commissioner Richard Condonsaid at a news conference Tuesday.   Harrison was able to fire at least five shots from the stolengun while he was being driven down Grand Central Parkway. Neitherofficer was able to reach revolvers in their ankle holsters andboth were dead at the scene. They were identified as DetectivesKeith L. Williams, 34, an eight-year veran, of Brooklyn, andRichard J. Guerzon, 46, a 20-year veteran, of Merrick.   Guerzon is to be buried Thursday, Williams on Friday.   The suspect's story is that the two officers were shot during arobbery, and the gunman freed him after killing the detectives,said Assistant District Attorney Bob Alexander.   During his brief arraignment in state Supreme Court in Queens,Harrison stood silently as defense attorney Michael Selio said hereserved the right to make a bail application at a later date.   The errors began, authorities said, when Harrison was left alonein a detectives' squad room, where he stole the gun from either anunlocked locker or one with a defective lock. Prisoners kept in theroom are usually handcuffed to a pipe out of reach of the lockers.   Harrison was supposed to be searched before his return to RikersIsland; either he wasn't or someone failed to locate the.38-caliber service revolver during their check, Condon said.Harrison might also have been cuffed with his hands in front,rather than behind his back, he said.   On the way back to Rikers, Harrison was seated alone in the backseat, with the two detectives in front _ another violation ofprocedure, said Condon.   Guerzon, who had been driving, was shot twice in the head.Williams was shot twice in the back and once in the head.   Despite his criminal background, Harrison's neighbors said hewas a well-behaved man whose mother made sure he received the bestof everything.   ``He doesn't come off as arrogant, always was friendly andpolite,'' said Larry Young, who has known the mother and son for 15years. ``He's like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde personality.''   Harrison has a record dating to 1980, when he was convicted ofassault at age 16. After several drug and additional assaultcharges, he was sentenced to 364 days in jail four years ago forbiting off a girlfriend's ear.   At the time of the police shootings, he was serving atwo-to-four-year sentence on a drug conviction.   He also was charged in July with strangling another girlfriendafter a night of partying and drug-taking and still faced trial.   In October, he and his mother were arrested for allegedlyconspiring to murder a witness against him in the July murder. Heallegedly had his mother offer $2,000 to a hit man who turned outto be an undercover detective.</TEXT></DOC>
