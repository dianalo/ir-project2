But whenthe major networks began coverage of Wednesday's U.S. militarystrike in Panama shortly after midnight, the reports from theircorrespondents there came by phone.   The reason: Gunmen loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriegia barredthem from a satellite transmission, network executives said. Nopictures of the U.S. attack's results or street scenes in PanamaCity were seen until after 9 a.m. EST, and then they were on tape,not live.   NBC got embroiled in a small war of its own _ complaints fromWTN, a London-based TV news agency serving CBS, ABC and CNN, thatNBC had aired nearly four minutes of WTN footage withoutpermission. An NBC spokesman said that was inadvertent, and thatNBC anchor Tom Brokaw told viewers the same thing.   But WTN president Kenneth A. Coyte, in a letter to NBC Newspresident Michael Gartner, protested ``in the strongest possibleterms'' NBC's action, calling it a ``cynical breach of professionalstandards.''   However, NBC officials said, all four U.S. networks shortlyafterwards agreed to pool their Panama footage. By mid-morning, thenetworks simultaneously were airing long-distance night shots ofmilitary buildings burning, white tracer bullets shootingoccasionally shooting skyward and shadowy gunmen on streets.   The networks also aired early daytime shots of Army helicopterslanding, two Air Force C-130 transports flying several thousandfeet above Panama City's Marriott Hotel, and U.S. paratroopers,faces daubed in dark green camouflages, taking positions neartrees, signs and parks.   At times, the war on TV took on an Alice-in-Wonderland quality.Brokaw, interviewing a Panama City resident by phone on the``Today'' show, asked him what local broadcasters were reporting.   Eloi Benedetti said he was watching reports of the U.S. strikeon the U.S. Armed Forces TV station, which also carried CNN. Brokawasked if the station was describing what was going on on the groundin Panama.   ``Well,'' Benedetti said, ``they're actually relaying the CNNbroadcast.''   It was a risky story for correspondents _ CNN used a stringer,Berta Thayer _ and producers. Some among the crowd of journalistsat the Marriott Hotel reported that gunmen waiting outside hadthreatened them, made it too dangerous to leave the hotel.   Four men thought to be Noriega loyalists seized two networkproducers in the hotel lobby. They later released one, ABC's RobertCampos, several hours later, ABC said. CBS said it was checkingunconfirmed reports that the other producer, Jon Meyersohn, whoworked for CBS, also had been freed.   NBC's Ed Rabel, reporting from the Marriott, fled to a nearbyU.S. military installation after gun-waving ``goons'' threatenedhis life, according to NBC News senior vice president JosephAngotti, running NBC's operation here.   ``They said they didn't want him or any other gringos around,that if they found him the next time they came around, they'll killhim,'' Angotti said.   The U.S. military operation against Noriega was accompanied by aPentagon news pool that included NBC's Fred Francis, pool reporterfor the networks. One of his reports, shown on CNN, included adiscussion with CNN anchor Bernard Shaw of what he'd seen.   The reporters were flown in on Air Force transports, but notearly enough, one CBS executive said.   ``We stll don't have information why the pool didn't go in withan early wave (of soldiers), or why they were held back ... untilpretty late in the game,'' said Don Decesare, CBS' vice presidentfor news coverage.   The pool system was developed after a controversy over the banon reporters accompanying the initial phases of the U.S. attack inGrenada in 1982. This group's TV gear included a portable satelliteground station.   But even though reporters were flown around the battle areas inhelicopters, it appeared late Wednesday afternoon that unexplainedsnags had developed and there'd be no pool pictures from thetransmitter, DeCesare said.   ``They have the capacity to feed (video reports),'' he said.``However, we still have yet to receive anything.''   He and his NBC and ABC counterparts were relieved when, at about35 minutes before their networks' first evening newscasts, thepool's videotape footage began coming in from Panama. Some shotswere taken over a the shoulder of a helicopter door gunner.</TEXT></DOC>
