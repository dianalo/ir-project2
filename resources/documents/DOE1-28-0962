The more than 20 wells drilled in 1965-1966include horizontal well, highly deviated multi-hole wells, multi-holecoring wells with large horizontal displacement, and continuous coringdeviated wells. Special instruments, tools and equipment were developedto meet the needs of drilling, coring, logging, cementing and completionof these highly deviated wells. Special technology was also developed,and some major parameters of performance reached advanced world levelat that time.</TEXT></DOC>
