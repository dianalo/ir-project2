KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd saidThursday he will not call up the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missiletreaty for debate until the question of whether the pact bansfuturistic weapons is better resolved.   But Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., the Senate's deputy GOP leader,said the White House has put ``400 lawyers to work'' on the issueand added: ``I think it can be resolved.''   Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., a member of the Senate IntelligenceCommittee, said, however, that the general question of futuristicweapons is a serious one and must be addressed sooner or later.   Hecht said U.S. intelligence reports show the Soviet Union has10,000 scientists working on the development of futuristic weaponsusing lasers and directed energy.   Hecht said the information came from a classified intelligencebriefing, but that he had been given permission to release it.   Byrd told reporters that the question of futuristic weapons hadbeen addressed inadequately by the administration and it was notclear that they are banned by the treaty's restrictions.   ``It is too important to risk going ahead,'' Byrd said. ``It isbetter to be sure, to be cautious and to be right. I intend not tocall it up until it is better resolved than it is now.''   ``The treaty has to be good for us,'' Byrd said, adding that hisdecision to delay action on the treaty is ``a signal to theadministration not to do in haste'' what should be done with care.   On another treaty issue, a group of Republican senators toldreporters at a luncheon meeting they believed compromise eventuallywill be reached on a move by Democrats to attach to the pactlanguage intended to bind future presidents to the current view ofthe meaning and impact of the treaty.   Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., a member of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee, called the Democratic effort ``an egregiousinsult to President Reagan'' and said it will not be settledwithout a pitched battle.   ``The Democrats will not let the treaty die because of this butwe might come perilously close before someone backs down,'' Evanssaid.   ``There is one group trying to kill the treaty and another grouptrying to embarrass the president, and neither group will win,''Evans said.   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he also believed thecontroversy will be resolved.   ``The Democrats will not let the treaty die on this issue,''McConnell said. ``I cannot believe that when push comes to shovethey are going to want to be held responsible by the Americanpeople for failure to ratify this treaty.''   The dispute grew out the Reagan administration'sreinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty topermit the deloyment of a strategic defense system.   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 17-2 vote onWednesday to approve the treaty and send it to the full Senate,where it was expected to be taken up following next week's Easterrecess.   Ambassador Maynard Glitman, the chief U.S. negotiator for thetreaty, told the committee that the treaty does ban future weaponsand that the Soviets understands they are banned.   Glitman said the treaty calls for the elimination of all``weapon delivery vehicles'' with a range from between 400 milesand 3,400 miles, asserting this covers all weapons, not just thosearmed with nuclear warheads.</TEXT></DOC>
