Culverhouse resumed his battle to gain control of Florida Commercial Banks Inc. by launching a tender offer for 389,159 shares for $50 each, or an indicated value of $19.5 million.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Culverhouse said the offer, if completed, would give him a 49.9% stake in the Miami-based bank holding company. Mr. Culverhouse, who currently holds 1,540,230 shares, or 39.9% of the company's 3,858,781 shares outstanding, said he would then attempt to sell the company to a third party.    Mr. Culverhouse, who also owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers professional football team, said he has already requested a special meeting of shareholders to replace Florida Commercial's current board with his own nominees.    The offer, his third since 1984, faces numerous hurdles, including a brand-new state anti-takeover law, company anti-takeover provisions, and a close-knit group of managers and directors that controls a large block of stock.    Joseph W. Armaly, chairman and chief executive officer of Florida Commercial, said on Friday he hadn't seen Mr. Culverhouse's formal proposal, but said his initial assessment was that &quot;it's an inadequate offer&quot; and &quot;very iffy.    &quot;This is an awfully attractive company with great earning capacity and hidden assets,&quot; he said.    However, Timothy Rayl, a Tampa stock analyst, called the bid, which is nearly three times the company's $17.24 per share book value, &quot;as high a price as I've ever seen offered for shares of a decent-sized bank.&quot;    Marc Perkins, also a Tampa stock analyst, wondered if the offer might split the shareholder group of managers and directors. &quot;Now we're going to see just how good of friends those (members of) the board of directors are,&quot; he said.    Analysts say Mr. Culverhouse's offer appears to be an attempt to break a longstanding stalemate with directors, who have consistently frustrated his efforts to join the board or significantly influence management despite his large stake.    In 1984, the board rebuffed his attempts to arrange a sale of the company to Sun Banks Inc., Orlando, Fla., now a unit of Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks Inc. Later, Mr. Culverhouse said in the SEC filing, the board refused to help him sell his own stake or allow him to acquire all the capital stock of two of the holding company's subsidiary banks. Hostile tender offers in 1984 and 1985 for a majority of the company fell far short of the goal.    Stephen Story, a law partner of Mr. Culverhouse, said the current tender offer is handicapped by the anti-takeover law passed by the legislature last month. Modeled after Indiana's law, the Florida statute allows outside shareholders to limit voting rights of investors who increase their stakes beyond certain threshold levels. In this case, the threshold is 50%. Several Florida attorneys say they believe this is the first time a hostile tender offer in Florida has been designed with the new law in mind.    In the filing, Mr. Culverhouse said he hasn't entered into negotiations with any possible suitors for Florida Commercial. He said any sale would have to be at a price of at least twice book value. </TEXT></DOC>
