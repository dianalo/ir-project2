The Commerce Department said consumer spending, after takinginflation into account, edged down 0.1 percent in June following a0.2 percent May decline. It marked the first back-to-back monthlydeclines in spending since September and October, 1987, a periodwhen consumer confidence was shaken by the stock market crash.   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overalleconomic activity, has been the driving force behind the recordpeacetime expansion, now in its seventh year. But economists arefearful that consumers, worried about their economic prospects,could begin to cut back sharply on their purchases.   The Commerce Department report said that personal incomes grew amodest 0.3 percent in June following an even smaller 0.2 percentMay increase. The gains were the weakest this year and reflected inpart a slowdown in job growth, which has sent the unemployment rateedging upward.   ``The economy, here at mid-year, is beginning to flirt with arecession,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.``We are seeing consumers' spending power being squeezed by higherinflation at the same time that pent-up demand for big-ticket itemsis pretty much exhausted.''   The government reported Thursday that the overall economy, asmeasured by the gross national product, expanded at a sluggishannual rate of 1.7 percent in the April-June quarter, the slowestpace in almost three years.   The Bush administration insists that growth will rebound in thesecond half of the year, fueled by lower interest rates engineeredby the Federal Reserve.   But Sinai said he believes the sluggish growth will intensify,leading to rising unemployment in coming months and furtherweakening consumer confidence. He predicted the economy would entera mild recession either late this year or early in 1990.   David Jones, chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., saidhe felt the country would be able to skirt through this period ofsluggish growth without a full-fledged downturn, helped in largepart by further moves by the Fed to lower interest rates.   The central bank earlier this week acted for the third timesince June to ease credit. Jones said the rapid pacing of theseinterest-lowering moves demonstrated how worried the Fed is about apossible recession.   ``The Fed is concerned that some interest-rate sensitive sectorsof the economy, such as autos and housing, are still quite weak,''Jones said. ``This will lead to further easing on the Fed's part inAugust.''   Before adjusting for inflation, consumer spending was unchangedat an annual rate of $3.44 trillion in June following a modest 0.3percent May increase.   The key income category of wages and salaries was up 0.5 percentin June but this was in part a bounceback after wage income wasessentially unchanged in May.   Farmers' incomes plunged at an annual rate of $12 billion inJune following a $1.4 billion May decrease. The weakness in Junereflected a drop in federal subsidy payments.   On the spending side, purchases of durable goods, items expectedto last three or more years, fell by $1.7 billion, following a $9.6billion decrease in May, with much of the weakness in both monthsreflecting a slump in car sales.   Purchases of non-durable goods edged up $400 million following amuch bigger $4.9 billion rise in May, an advance that had beenpropelled by higher food and gasoline costs.   Purchases of services were up $2.5 billion following a giant$12.7 billion May jump that had reflected a surge in utility billscaused by hot weather.   Disposable, or after-tax, incomes climbed by 0.6 percent in Junefollowing a rise in May of 0.8 percent.   The personal savings rate _ savings as a percentage ofdisposable income _ climbed to 5.9 percent in June, the highestlevel since March, when it was 6.2 percent. In April, the savingsrate took a nosedive to 4.9 percent as Americans had to writechecks to pay income taxes.   Analysts said a rising savings rate is an indication thatconsumers are becoming more cautious.</TEXT></DOC>
