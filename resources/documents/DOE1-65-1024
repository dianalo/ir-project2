This new reality poses both strategic and ethical problemsfor the United States and its allies. The author views the West as tornbetween the strategic necessity to preserve our offensive nuclear weaponsas a deterrent to the Soviets, and the ethical compunctions most Westernershave against ever using such weapons should deterrence fail. The authoris not unduly pessimistic about the continued success of deterrence.He points out that, forty years after the end of the Second World War,the two superpowers have not gone to war with each other. Also, he fearsthe United States' deterrent capacity far less than the Soviet strategicbuildup that has been going on for the last decade; in this, too, hismoral sensibilities differ dramatically from those of some of the otherauthors in this section. In short, he holds no truck either with theadvocates of mutually assured destruction (MAD) or with those who preferminimal deterrence. The former are too ready to hold Western lives hostageto the mercies of the Soviets, while the latter ignore the emphasis onmilitary superiority in Soviet military doctrine. The author's preferredcourse for United States defense policy includes force modernization,arms control as a means to build support for modernization, and deterrencebased on enhanced survival rather than mutual destruction. Thus, he looksapprovingly on the Reagan Administration's Strategic Defense Initiative.</TEXT></DOC>
