Among black infants, the rate is more than six in 10, thenational Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.   Infant mortality rates are higher among children born to singlemothers, who often provide less financial security than somemarried parents, the CDC said.   Twenty-four percent of U.S. infants were born to unmarried womenin 1987, the latest year for which statistics are available, theCDC said. In 1950, the figure was 4 percent.   The percentage of black infants born to unmarried mothers was 62percent, compared with 17 percent of white infants. Both are upfrom 1983, when 59 percent of black births were to single mothers,compared with 13 percent of white births, the CDC said.   ``These figures are alarming,'' said Evelyn Lowery, president ofSCLC Women, a branch of the Southern Christian LeadershipConference. ``The problems are not getting better; they're gettingworse.''   In its weekly report, the Atlanta-based CDC said singlemotherhood is a signal, but not a direct cause, of possible healthproblems for the child.   ``Marital status confers neither risk nor protection to theinfant,'' the CDC said. ``Rather, the principal benefits ofmarriage to infant survival are economic and social support.''   ``Our effort at teen pregnancy education has got to continue,''said Mrs. Lowery, the wife of SCLC president Joseph Lowery. ``Manyof these young people are from single parent homes.''   U.S. infant mortality rates are higher for infants born tounmarried mothers than for children of marriage, for both whitesand blacks, the CDC said, citing new analysis of 1983 statistics.For whites, the infant mortality rate was 13.1 per 1,000 childrenof unmarried mothers, compared to 7.8 for children of marriedmothers. For blacks, the non-marriage infant mortality rate was19.6, compared to 14.6.   But when talking about children of teen-age mothers, the``benefits of marriage'' cited by the CDC may not be there.Mortality rates for infants of married mothers under 18 tend to beeven worse than for unmarried mothers under 18, probably because ofa ``severe lack of economic and social support'' in struggling teenmarriages, the CDC said.   ``Married teen-agers are ... more likely to establishindependent households, thereby estranging themselves fromfinancial and child-care support from relatives,'' the agency said.   In general, unmarried mothers often are poor, and ``adversepregnancy outcomes are correlated with poverty conditions,'' theCDC said.   The Census Bureau has reported that 36 percent of black familieswith a child under 18 are classified as living in poverty, comparedwith 12 percent of similar white families.</TEXT></DOC>
