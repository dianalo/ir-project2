In each case except thyroid, where malignancies are rare,data are presented for normal and malignant tissue. Results show thatvariations in response, consistent with those observed in vivo, can bemeasured. Tumours were in all cases highly resistant to radiation relativeto their corresponding normal tissue. Possible reasons for this are discussed.The method may prove useful in the prediction of the radiobiologicalresponse for tumour and surrounding normal tissue where post-operativetherapy is planned.</TEXT></DOC>
