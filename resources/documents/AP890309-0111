AU.S. official denied the report.   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass reported that Moslemguerrillas fired rockets Wednesday at the airport in Kabul, theAfghan capital, killing four people including a small child.   The United States and Pakistan back the guerrillas. But thenations have denied sending personnel to Afghanistan to help theinsurgents, despite repeated charges to the contrary byAfghanistan's communist government.   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said 500 Pakistani militarypersonnel also were killed in Wednesday's fighting near the easterncity of Jalalabad.   Maj. Robin Higgins, a Pentagon spokeswoman, denied that U.S.advisers were killed and said: ``There are no Department of Defenseadvisers inside Afghanistan.'' She said in an interview inWashington that the only U.S. soldiers in the region are inPakistan, where they are training guerrillas to neutralize landsmines in a program initiated by the United Nations.   Sources close to the guerrillas said fighting has been heavyaround Jalalabad during the past several days.   A guerrilla spokesman in Pakistan, who requested anonymity, saidtoday that the insurgents had attacked Jalalabad's airport withlong-range artillery.   Some guerrilla sources and Pakistan's official television said onWednesday that the airport had fallen to the insurgents. Otherguerrilla sources have contradicted those reports.   Jalalabad is 45 miles west of the Pakistan border and on the mainhighway linking the Afghan capital with Pakistan.   Radio Kabul said ``100s of criminals'' were killed by governmenttroops protecting the city.   The Soviet army withdrew from Afghanistan last month after nineyears of supporting the communist government.   The guerrillas have vowed to overthrow the Afghan government andhave formed a government-in-exile in Pakistan to take over.   Saudi Arabia today became the first country to officiallyrecognize the government-in-exile. The oil-rich kingdom has giventhe guerrillas considerable support in their struggle.</TEXT></DOC>
