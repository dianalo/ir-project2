This proposal is promptedby full-scale fatigue testing which has identified certain structural componentswhich are prone to fatigue cracks. This condition, if not corrected, couldresult in reduction of the structural integrity of these airplanes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received no later than November 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Send comments on the proposal in duplicate to the FederalAviation Administration, Northwest Mountain Region, Transport AirplaneDirectorate, ANM-103, Attention: Airworthiness Rules Docket No. 89-NM-162-AD,17900 Pacific Highway South, C-68966, Seattle, Washington 98168.

The proposals contained in this Notice may be changedin light of the comments received.Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic,environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submittedwill be available, both before and after the closing date for comments,in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizingeach FAA/public contact, concerned with the substance of this proposal,will be filed in the Rules Docket.Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submittedin response to this Notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped post cardon which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 89-NM-162-AD.''The post card will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>The Direction GeandCx.174;1neandCx.174;1rale de L'Aviation Civile (DGAC), whichis the airworthiness authority of France, in accordance with existing provisionsof a bilateral airworthiness agreement, has notified the FAA of an unsafecondition which may exist on certain Airbus Industrie Model A300 seriesairplanes.Full-scale fatigue testing by the manufacturer has shown that fatigue cracksmay develop in certain structural components of the longitudinal lap joints.Inspections of in-service airplanes have also revealed disbonding and corrosionon the bonded inner doublers of the longitudinal lap joints. This condition,if not corrected, could lead to reduced structural capability of theseairplanes.Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A300-53-211, Revision 1, datedApril 10, 1989, which describes procedures for repetitive inspections forcracks of the fuselage longitudinal lap joints in sections 13 through 18,and repair, if necessary.Airbus Industrie has also issued Service Bulletin A300-53-229, Revision2, dated July 28, 1989, which describes procedures for inspection of thebonded inner doublers of the fuselage longitudinal lap joints, in sections13 through 18, for disbonding and corrosion, and repair, if necessary.The DGAC has classified both service bulletins as mandatory, and has issuedAirworthiness Directive 89-061-092(B) addressing these subjects.This airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated inthe United States under the provisions of andSection; 21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design registered in the United States, an AD is proposedwhich would require repetitive eddy current and ultrasonic inspectionsof the fuselage longitudinal lap joints, between section 13 and 18, forcracks, disbonding, and corrosion, and repair, if necessary, in accordancewith the service bulletins previously described.It is estimated that 66 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 2,379 manhours per airplane toaccomplish the required actions, and that the average labor cost wouldbe $40 per manhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of theAD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $6,280,560.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
