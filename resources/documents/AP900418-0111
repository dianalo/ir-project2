The General Accounting Office last month reported that thenation's 4-year-old immigration law had resulted in hiringdiscrimination by employers afraid of being punished for employingillegal aliens.   The agency said discrimination might be reduced by simplifyingthe process for checking work eligibility, perhaps by relying on arevised Social Security card or a driver's license with a verifiedSocial Security number.   Legislation pushed by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,would require the government to develop plastic, counterfeit-proofSocial Security cards to replace the current paper cards.   Moynihan said the new cards could reduce fraud, improveconfidence in Social Security and provide a more reliable means forchecking work eligibility. But the senators said he would not pushfor legislative action until a government task force considers waysto reduce hiring discrimination under the immigration law.   Louis Enoff, deputy commissioner for programs at the SocialSecurity Administration, said that the agency does not need fanciercards to do its job and that there are less expensive ways toaddress employment discrimination.   ``The administration has always had fundamental concerns aboutthe possibility of the Social Security card and number becoming auniversal identifier in this country,'' he told the Financesubcommittee on Social Security and family policy.   Andrew Strojny of the Justice Department said that requiring jobapplicants to present Social Security cards could create problemsfor people who lose their cards and could allow unscrupulousemployers to ``maintain a captive labor force'' by confiscatingtheir workers' Social Security cards.   ``Simply because a single-card system has the virtue ofsimplicity does not mean it is a simple solution,'' Strojny said.   Gene McNary, commissioner of the Immigration and NaturalizationService, said the agency wants to avoid the creation of a nationalID card that raises the image of ``Big Brother,'' yet needs to finda standard ``employment authorization document.'' He said the INSwas awaiting the task force's analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
