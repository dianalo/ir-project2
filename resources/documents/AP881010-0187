(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three lightly dressed hikersturned up safe Monday after 24 hours in snow, fog and wind on MountWashington, where the wind-chill at the summit was 17 below zero inthe morning.   Fish and game officials and volunteers had organized searchparties for the three, who had no rain gear or warm clothes, aftera fourth companion had turned back and reported the situation toofficials.   ``It was really, really cold. We are very lucky,'' said one ofthe hikers, Andy Stewart, 23, of Syosset, N.Y.   The hikers had ignored advice from a shelter caretaker on the6,288-foot mountain Sunday evening and continued toward the summit,said Peter Crane, a member of the staff at a mountaintop weatherobservatory.   Mount Washington is notorious for severe and quickly changingweather. Snow has fallen on the summit in every month, and thehighest surface wind speed ever recorded _ 231 mph _ was registeredat the observatory in 1934.   Stewart said the three were caught in a sudden storm.   ``It was fine, then, two minutes later, there were 60 mph windsand heavy snow,'' he said. ``The snow was up to my chin all the waydown.''   Stewart said they stayed warm by building a fire _ even burningdollar bills to keep it going. They resumed their hike down themountain about 8 a.m.   ``We burned whatever we could, bank cards, money, phonenumbers,'' said another hiker, Steve Sardella, 20, of Marlboro,Mass.   The third hiker was Matt Dube, 21, of Bethany, Conn. All werestudents at Northeastern University.   The hikers said they had on three layers of clothing and carriedextra sweaters. They also said they carried sandwiches, crackersand nuts as well as apples.   Maj. Henry Mock of the state Fish and Game Department said thethree reached Crawford Notch, a pass on the western side of themountain, around 2 p.m. Monday in good condition.   Searchers Monday reported snow drifts up to 4 feet deep, Torreysaid. A road to the summit had been closed for three days becauseof snowdrifts. Weather observer John Howe said the summit had a lowSunday of 14 degrees. Winds gusted to 70 mph Sunday.   Records compiled the U.S. Forest Service and others indicatethat 103 people have died on Mount Washington since 1849. The mostrecent apparently were two climbers killed in separate incidents inMarch 1983. Both lost their footing and slid to their deaths downicy slopes.</TEXT></DOC>
