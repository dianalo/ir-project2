Anthony Burns, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said.    In the year-earlier quarter, Ryder had net income of $22.6 million, or 31 cents a share, adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock split paid in May 1986.    Ryder had about 78 million shares outstanding in the first quarter of 1987, compared with 72 million -- restated for the split -- in the year-before period. Per-share earnings increased more than 30%, Mr. Burns said.    The estimated profit exceeded expectations of most Wall Street analysts, who, on average, expected earnings of about 38 cents a share.    Revenue in the 1987 quarter rose to &quot;more than $1 billion,&quot; Mr. Burns said, an increase of at least 17% from the year-earlier $852.8 million.    The transportation and business-services concern expects to release first-quarter results in about two weeks.    &quot;Things look very good. This is a continuation of last year,&quot; Mr. Burns said in an interview, adding: &quot;If there is any reasonable economic activity, we ought to be able to achieve&quot; the company's targeted long-term earnings growth rate of 15% a year.    Mr. Burns said pre-tax earnings in Ryder's vehicle leasing and services division declined in the first quarter, because its gain on the sale of equipment was less than the $11.5 million reported for the year-earlier quarter.    &quot;We've had lesser gains on the sale of equipment in the last three quarters, so that's a trend,&quot; Mr. Burns said. He added, however, that pre-tax earnings from operations in the vehicle leasing and services division &quot;were up soundly&quot; from the $15 million of the year-earlier quarter, &quot;And that's the important thing,&quot; he said.    Mr. Burns said that &quot;despite a difficult operating environment&quot; for the auto carrier division, pre-tax earnings in the first quarter in that division were &quot;up quite soundly&quot; from the year-before period, when those operations produced pre-tax profit of $9.3 million.    The official said pre-tax earnings in Ryder's aviation services segment increased &quot;quite dramatically&quot; from last year's pre-tax profit of $9.5 million because of increases in the sale and leasing of aviation parts and aircraft. He also said Ryder's insurance management services in the first quarter also showed a good profit increase from the year before. </TEXT></DOC>
