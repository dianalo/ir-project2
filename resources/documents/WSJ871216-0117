Mr. Ruder testified before the Senate Banking Committee's securities subcommittee, whose chairman, Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), indicated that he is growing impatient with the pace of the SEC's investigation of Wall Street's insider-trading scandal.    Mr. Ruder said the cases will be brought &quot;probably&quot; in a matter of months, not weeks, and promised that the agency will soon make a public statement giving more detail on its investigation.    The SEC chairman also said the agency is pursuing leads in &quot;many other cases that aren't strictly insider-trading cases.&quot;    But Mr. Ruder distanced himself from a federal prosecutor's statement released earlier this week that said Mr. Boesky's revelations have given investigators a window on &quot;rampant criminal conduct&quot; in the securities industry. Asked about that statement, made in a pre-sentencing memorandum on Mr. Boesky, Mr. Ruder said: &quot;The word 'rampant' may be a little strong. I believe that most participants in the securities markets essentially are honest.&quot;    The insider-trading scandal dates back to May 1986, when the SEC charged Dennis Levine, then a managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., with large-scale insider trading. Mr. Levine pleaded guilty a month later and gave the SEC information leading to Mr. Boesky, who last November agreed to an unprecedented $100 million settlement of insider-trading charges.    Mr. Boesky, who pleaded guilty to one felony and is scheduled for sentencing Friday, in turn made disclosures that led to guilty pleas by Martin Siegel, a former takeover specialist at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., and Boyd Jefferies, former chairman of Jefferies Group Inc.    Among those now known to be under investigation are Michael Milken, head of Drexel's junk bond operations, New York investor Carl Icahn and New York arbitrager John Mulheren. None has been charged; all have asserted innocence.    Pressed by Sen. Riegle about apparent delays in the SEC's pursuit of Boesky leads, Mr. Ruder said, &quot;The delay, if any, is due not to our unwillingness or lack of desire, but to the exceedingly complicated nature of some of these cases.&quot;    Not satisfied, Sen. Riegle asked the SEC to state the scope and status of its investigation within a few days. &quot;You've got to give us a better sense of what's going on here,&quot; he said. Mr. Ruder agreed to deliver a statement about the timing and number of the investigations under way.    In subsequent testimony, Kenneth Bialkin, chairman of an American Bar Association committee on insider-trading legislation, said he and most of the committee members have several problems with pending legislation that codifies the law on the subject. Mr. Bialkin suggested the committee may oppose the bill unless it's modified in several ways. </TEXT></DOC>
