The closely held company, Gatekeeper TelecommunicationsSystems Inc. has attracted some of the best-known names inthe computer-security field, including a former AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. security specialist and a prominentArizona prosecutor who has spent a decade chasing hackers.</LP><TEXT>   Gatekeeper said it has developed a device akin to anelectronic key-and-lock that denies hackers access to acomputer carrier tone, making it far more difficult to breakinto a system.   &quot;If this device were in widespread use, it'd take all thefun out of being a hacker,&quot; said Gail Thackeray, a formerArizona assistant attorney general who will be a vicepresident of the company. Law enforcers have been forced towaste resources on hackers who take unauthorized joy-ridesinside business computers or the public phone system, shesaid, when they could be chasing &quot;the real criminals&quot;committing more serious communications and computer fraud.   Ms. Thackeray said the Gatekeeper system is&quot;cost-effective, secure and idiotproof.&quot; It won't bepractical for every phone line, she said, and won't solveserious computer crime such as electronic theft or vandalismcommitted by angry employees or other insiders. But it couldslam the door shut on most hackers, she said.   Under Gatekeeper's system, users would send a unique codegenerated by a small keypad over a phone line to get accessto their computer or phone system. The &quot;lock&quot; is installed infront of a modem, a common computer communications device, sothat hackers don't even get a computer &quot;handshake&quot; tellingthem what system is on the other end. And it doesn'tinterfere with existing password programs.   The device also is designed to protect corporate phonesystems, which are increasingly targeted by hackers who runup huge charges. Last week, Mitsubishi International Corp.sued ATandamp;T, the maker of its phone system, seeking $10 millionin damages and recovery of $430,000 for more than 30,000unauthorized calls placed to numbers around the world.   Neal Norman, one of ATandamp;T's top network security executivesuntil his retirement two years ago, is Gatekeeper'spresident. He said the system could prevent much of theaccess fraud being committed by hackers targeting ATandamp;T andlocal telephone networks. &quot;I've spent years working toprotect the telephone network, and no one else has come upwith anything that does what this system can do,&quot; he said.   At least one of the regional Bell phone companies hasexpressed interest in the system, as have law enforcementagencies and a top accounting firm, Mr. Norman said. Hewouldn't detail the contacts.   The systems -- starting at less than $10,000, depending ontheir configuration -- will be available this fall, said Mr.Norman.</TEXT></DOC>
