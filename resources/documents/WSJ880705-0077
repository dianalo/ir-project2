Government has to stop &quot;encouraging the weak,&quot; he complains. &quot;The weak should either become strong or they should get out of the marketplace.&quot;    Mr. Adelizzi is president of Home Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association in San Diego. Tired of bearing the costs and uncertainty of the struggling savings and loan system, Home Federal wants to leave the system and become a bank.    For the savings industry, the party is over and the old gang is breaking up. The once-fraternal industry is torn by dissension as massive losses of sick Sandamp;Ls sap its earnings, raise the prospects of huge new costs and threaten its future.    &quot;What looms before us is the prospect of vampire economics,&quot; frets Theo Pitt, chairman of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry's leading trade group, &quot;a prescription that would suck away our capital, the very life blood of our system of depository institutions.&quot;    A major transition of the industry has already begun. Since 1980, about one-third of the thrift industry has disappeared, mostly by merger. Some healthy thrifts privately predict that a brutal consolidation will leave as few as 500 survivors of today's about 3,500 federally insured savings institutions.    &quot;The days when the thrift industry was a collection of companies with the same interests are over,&quot; says John Buchanan, a First Boston Corp. analyst and former chief of staff at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. &quot;Some are now saying, 'we've got to look out for ourselves.'&quot;    Increasingly, strong thrifts are doing just that, at the expense of the weak. They demand federal insurance-premium discounts -- but only for capital-flush thrifts. They seek freedom to sell out to bank holding companies, a boon currently reserved for the industry's basket cases. They press for the closing of insolvent thrifts, which sap industry margins by bidding up deposit rates while bidding down mortgage interest rates.    And some want to desert the thrifts' shaky Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. for the banks' more secure Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The FSLIC, struggling with a swelling number of thrifts that are broke, charges premiums that are 2 1/2 times higher than those of the FDIC.    Weaker thrifts are fighting back. About two-thirds of all Sandamp;Ls lack the 6% capital-to-assets ratio required for membership in the FDIC. They know an exodus to the FDIC could quickly pull down the shaky FSLIC. They want the door barred, and Congress appears ready to comply.    Mr. Adelizzi in San Diego has no apologies about wanting to leave the FSLIC. Insolvent thrifts' losses, &quot;are not the fault of my shareholders,&quot; he says. &quot;I've got a responsibility to see that they aren't burdened with this any further.&quot;    How times change. For years, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions lobbied effectively to let its growing number of insolvent members keep operating. Only last year, it convinced Congress that the industry could solve its own problems for about $5 billion, with the healthy thrifts footing the bill.    Today, with the estimated cost of curing sick thrifts soaring past $60 billion, by some accounts, Sandamp;Ls are changing their tune. &quot;If the good guys are going to keep paying for the bad guys, they'll pull us all down,&quot; says Russell Mann, president of First Federal Savings andamp; Loan, Barrington, Ill.    A showdown on the question of restructuring the thrift industry and its regulator, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, is expected next year when a new administration takes office. The new president &quot;will be told it can't be deferred for four years,&quot; says Eric Hemel, a former Bank Board research director.    Several options under discussion chill the hearts of old-line Sandamp;L executives: merging the thrifts' deposit insurance fund with the stronger bank fund; tightening regulatory controls; cutting back deposit insurance; stripping capital from the Sandamp;L-owned Home Loan Banks or their Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.; assessing Sandamp;Ls $9 billion on top of their currently high insurance premiums.    The main bulwark against change has been the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. Its president, William O'Connell, rails against &quot;bankification&quot; of the Sandamp;L industry as a threat to home finance.    The trade group has been &quot;looking out for the old-line mutual institution, the guys who want to keep things the way they are,&quot; says Bert Ely, a thrift consultant based in Alexandria, Va.    The league faces more dissent from within and from the smaller National Council of Savings Institutions. The council appeals to well-heeled dissenters by stressing efficiency, competitiveness and breaking down barriers between thrifts and banks. Last year, it drafted a plan for merging the FDIC and FSLIC.    At stake for many thrifts is a way of life. In the past, Sandamp;Ls stuck mainly to making home loans. But since the late '70s, Sandamp;Ls have been buffeted by poorly supervised deregulation, rising competition and regional recessions, pushing many to experiment with riskier investments. Since 1960, mortgages have fallen to about 50% of thrifts' assets, from 73%. Thrifts' share of all U.S. home mortgages has dropped below 30%. Dwight Jaffe, a Princeton University economist, asserts that, &quot;the historical basis for the special role of thrifts has all but disappeared.&quot;    The new divergence within the industry stands out along Cermak Road, just west of Chicago, an artery once known as &quot;Bohemian Wall Street&quot; because its thrifts bulged with the savings of the frugal Czech immigrants who settled the surrounding rows of bungalows.    In Cicero, Central Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association sticks to mortgage lending and shuns newfangled stock ownership, branching, consumer loans, teller machines and credit cards. &quot;The Bohemian credit card is cash,&quot; says Chairman Frank Kryda Sr.    Though admittedly struggling to maintain required capital levels, Mr. Kryda wants to keep banks out of the Sandamp;L business. &quot;I think the thrift industry knows its business best,&quot; he says.    Seven blocks down Cermak Road. in Berwyn, Land of Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association has evolved to Land of Lincoln Financial Services Network.    Today, corporate affiliates jam rooms that Land of Lincoln used to reserve for neighborhood gatherings and its Christmas petting zoo. They sell stocks, insurance and real estate. They provide title services, financial planning and tax advice. They build homes and syndicate real estate. Thrifts need the extra products, or &quot;they'll just have the crumbs to pick up,&quot; says Thomas Kinst, Lincoln's president and chief executive officer.    Land of Lincoln has built a strong capital base and acquired 19 other Illinois offices. Mr. Kinst has considered seeking FDIC insurance, and talks of expanding regionally or selling out to a bank.    The trends worry his father, Frank, 74, chairman of the board and veteran of more than a half-century at the thrift institution. &quot;I can't get used to the way businesses are running today,&quot; Frank Kinst says. &quot;It is so damn foreign to me. Somehow we have lost touch with humanity.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
