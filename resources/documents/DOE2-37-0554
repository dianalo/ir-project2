In 34 out of42 cases diagnosed preoperatively as N/sub 2/, swelling of lymph nodesto more than 11 mm in diameter was discovered at operation, and the rateof accurate diagnosis was 81 %. No swelling was noted in 8 cases. Incontrast, the rate of accurate diagnosis of the cases which were firstconsidered to be C - N/sub 2/, but were later diagnosed by pathologicalexamination as P - N/sub 2/, was 52 %. Among cases of C - N/sub 2/, however,the 7 cases of N/sub 2/, in which metastasis to nodes was not detected,represented 17 % of the total number of C - N/sub 2/ cases. By contrast,the number of the cases of C - N/sub 2/ which proved to be P - N/sub2/ was only 2 (6 %). Differences between the sites of metastasis didnot affect the rate of accurate diagnosis in this study. In conclusion,by combing the use of conventional CT and Ga-emission CT, our abilityto diagnose malignancy in cases of N/sub 2/ improved up to 85 % in termsof overall accuracy of diagnosis.</TEXT></DOC>
