In the modern capital of Islamabad and the old, adjoining cityof Rawalpindi, there is little outward sense of mass bereavement.   ``Our religion says that when any Moslem dies, all the peoplefeel sorry,'' said a gray-haired shopkeeper. ``It is better not tosay more. The world goes on.''   Zia, who seized power in a bloodless coup, ruled as a militaryman although sometimes in conjunction with civilian governments,and he inspired more respect than love.   Many people, when asked what his death meant to them, seemedincapable of articulating emotions. Instead, they responded withrecitations that the president had been killed, perhaps by a bomb,as the country's newspapers have speculated. Officially, there hasbeen no word on the cause of the in-flight explosion that killedZia and 29 others Wednesday.   Life in Islamabad and Rawalpindi without Zia conveys little morethan a mood of propriety. Flags fly at half-staff, and police andsoldiers line major streets and the route of Saturday's funeralprocession.   The sense of dignity without emotion fits neatly in the twincities where street signs exhort people to ``Smile,'' ``Give achild a book,'' and ``In case of forest fire, please ring 827227.''   In the southern port city of Karachi, core of the politicalopposition led by Benazir Bhutto, people handed out candy, atraditional gesture of celebration in this Islamic country.   Most of the public tears seemed confined to a crowd of women whogathered outside Zia's residence in Rawalpindi on Thursday and toabout 50 male relatives and associates who met the coffin thatbrought Zia's remains to Islamabad airport Thursday night.   But people often spoke of their late president's strength.   ``Zia was trying to make Pakistan a very strong country,'' highschool student Moin Qazi said as he pushed his bicycle down astreet in Rawalpindi. ``His death is a great loss.''   Moin, the 17-year-old son of an army general, was scornful thatany civilian opposition leaders would emerge to lead the country.   ``Benazir Bhutto is just a foolish woman,'' he said.   At Islamabad's Aabpara market, Nazir Sheik presided over hisfamily's photo shop. ``Gen. Zia was very expert in dealing withIndia,'' the 22-year-old man said, referring to the neighbor thathas fought three wars with Pakistan since the two countries werepartitioned upon gaining independence from Britain in 1947.   An army captain watching security preparations at Islamabad'sFaisal mosque, where Zia's funeral will be conducted Saturday,said: ``It is difficult to imagine Pakistan without Zia. He wassuch a strong man.'' The bearded officer asked that his name not beused.   But there was a tinge of emotion at Zia's gravesite on thegrassy lawn in front of the mosque.   ``I am digging this grave with my heart,'' 23-year-old AbdulKhalek said as he leaned on his shovel to rest for a few minutes.</TEXT></DOC>
