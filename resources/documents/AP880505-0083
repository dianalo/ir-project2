EDITSto conform. No Pickup.</NOTE><DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a pair of mountaineering firsts,multinational climbing teams scaled Mount Everest simultaneouslyfrom two directions today and made a live television broadcast fromatop the world's highest mountain.   Signals relayed via satellite from a small video camera attachedto the helmet of Japanese climber Susumu Nakamura showed apanoramic view of the deep blue sky and rough, snow-covered terrainat the top of the world.   Gasping from the thin air and with frost on their eyebrows, 10climbers from Nepal, China and Japan in bright red, blue and yellowmountaineering gear congratulated each other. They erected on thesummit a string of brightly colored banners during the livebroadcast, monitored in Tokyo.   Nakamura's specially-made camera is so full of sensitiveequipment that, if abandoned on the Chinese side of the mountain,it could be viewed as a violation of Western laws governing thetransfer of high technology to communist nations, said HiroshiYamazaki of Japan's Nihon Television Corp., or NTV, which paid mostof the expedition's $12.5 million bill.   NBC News Sunrise, monitored in New York, began its 6 a.m. EDTshow with footage of the climbers celebrating at the summit.Chinese television also broadcast part of the climb. The livebroadcast was the longest ever in China.   The expedition, involving more than 200 people from Japan, Nepaland China, is the largest assault ever on Everest. One member ofthe Japanese team, Hidetaka Mizukoshi, died of heart failure duringthe climb.   Climbing began last month to celebrate the 35th anniversary ofthe first Everest conquest by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary andSherpa guide Tenzing Norgay. More than 192 people have since scaledthe 29,028-foot mountain, with 13 climbing more than once.   In this climb, however, members of two teams met at the summitafter climbing simultaneously from the mountain's north face inChina and the south face in Nepal, the first such rendezvous inhistory.   ``This is the greatest event in the history of climbing,'' saidKunga Sherpa, leader of one of the Nepalese base camp setups.   On the summit, a cameraman asked one of the Japanese climbershow he felt, and he gaspingly replied: ``I feel great!''   NTV is Japan's largest commercial network and it, too, iscelebrating its 35th anniversary.   As seen in Japan, the broadcast was one technical blitz afteranother.   Aside from the broadcast at the summit, the NTV producers wereable to switch their broadcasts from the base camp on the southside of the mountain to the north side.   And at one point, a Japanese broadcaster held up a document thathad been received in a base camp by facsimile transmission fromTokyo. Relatives of the climbers were in the NTV studio in Tokyoand were able to speak directly to the climbers atop the mountain.   During an earlier live broadcast, Chinese television showedmembers of the two teams approaching the peak from the south andnorth painstakingly making their way toward the summit.   The Chinese broadcast said Tibetan climber Cering Doje andNepal's Ang Lhakpa Sherpa, the first climbers to reach the summit,waited along with Noboru Yamada of Japan in a small hut for othersto arrive.   ``This is an exciting moment. The motherland thanks you. TheChinese people thank you,'' the Chinese newscaster said. Seniorleader Deng Xiaopeng called the television station to congratulatethe ``great pioneers'' of all three countries.   The 10 climbers at the top then filled small bottles withsamples of snow, and spilled whiskey on the ground to honorclimbers who have died in previous attempts.   Soon after, the 10 were shown beginning their descent to tryanother first _three climbers who reached the summit from the northwill descend southward and three who came from the south willdescend to the north.</TEXT></DOC>
