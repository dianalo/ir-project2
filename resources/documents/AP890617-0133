Ninety anti-abortion protesters were carried away on policestretchers in St. Petersburg, Fla., including 23 who chainedthemselves to the doors of a clinic with special bicycle locksalmost impossible to cut with normal tools.   ``No children were killed in this building today _ we shut downthe clinic,'' said the Rev. Christopher Osborne, pastor of River ofLife Fellowship and leader of the protest.   Deborah Struthers, head of the All Women's Health Clinic, saidall appointments, including some planned abortions, had beenpostponed or diverted to other facilities.   Frustrated authorities had to call the group's local attorney tonegotiate the chained protesters' surrender, said police spokesmanWendall Creager. A member of the group finally provided keys to thelocks, and the demonstrators were removed and booked on charges oftrespassing and resisting without violence, police said.   The protesters were met at the clinic by about 20counter-demonstrators.   ``This issue is not only about abortion, but a woman's right tohealth care,'' said Linda Osten, president of the Upper PinellasNational Organization For Women. ``These people brought their liesand propaganda here today, but the majority of Americans know womenneed choices.''   Chicago police carried away dozens of anti-abortion protesters bytheir arms and legs outside a North Side clinic. Seventy-threepeople will be charged with mob action and disorderly conduct,police Sgt. James Larner said.   About 2,000 abortion rights demonstrators held a rally at theDaley Plaza in downtown Chicago.   Signs in the crowd of mostly women read: ``Keep Your Laws Off MyBody,'' ``Keep Abortions Legal,'' and ``The Choice is Mine.''   At one point, about 250 anti-abortion demonstrators showed up atthe plaza carrying red traffic stop signs that read, ``Stop AbortionNow.''   A double police barricade kept the two sides apart, but theychanted back and forth at each other, ``Choice, choice, choice,''and ``Roe V. Wade Has Got to Go.''   Numerous abortion protests, both pro and con, have occurredaround the nation since the U.S. Supreme Court began considering acase which could reverse the Roe vs. Wade decision of 1973. Theruling made abortion legal in the early stages of pregnancy.   In West Hartford, Conn., about 100 anti-abortion protestersoccupied the Summit Women's Center, jamming elevators and anoperating room and halting clinic operations while as many as 300people sang and demonstrated outside. Some carried a banner thatread, ``Killing Factory Closed.''   Police arrested 261 protesters and took them by city bus to thepolice station, said officer Douglas R. Ahlstrin. Some struggled andshouted out Biblical passages as they were dragged to the buses.   On the other side of the street, about 100 pro-choicedemonstrators carried signs saying, ``Stand Up For Choice'' and``Defend Abortion Rights'' and chanted ``Not the Church, Not theState, Women Will Decide Our Fate.''   ``I think this boils down to that it's a woman's right and keepthe government out of it,'' said Laura D. Verbarg, who said she wasdriving past the demonstration when she decided to join thepro-choice advocates.   In Dallas, about 250 people demonstrated and 44 were arrestedduring a demonstration at Routh Street Women's Clinic, said a policespokeswoman who refused to give her name.   The protest, organized by the anti-abortion group Dallas Rescue,was dubbed ``Father's Day Rescue, said Laura Weston, a spokeswomanfor the group.   ``The father is supposed to protect his wife, the mother, and hischildren,'' Ms. Weston said.</TEXT></DOC>
