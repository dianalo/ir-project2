The Metropolitan Police Department said it arrested YoshikazuOno, 44, and Teruko Takeuchi, 43, of the Kyokuto Shokai company;and Yasuhiko Kusabe, 51, of Shinsei Koeki.   Police said Kyokuto Shokai and Shinsei Koeki exported electronicequipment to China between June 1985 and November 1986 withoutgovernment permission.   Ono was in charge of all exports by Kyokuto Shokai whileTakeuchi was in charge of the company's exports to China. Kusabewas in charge of exports by Shinsei Koeki.   The three were charged with violating two Japanese laws, theForeign Exchange and Trade Control Law and the Customs Law.   Exporting such equipment to communist nations is banned by theCoordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, aParis-based watchdog body on trade with Commuist bloc nations.   Police also filed charges under the same laws against the twocompanies and Iwatsu Electric Co., which manufactured the exportedproducts. Police said Iwatsu is suspected of supplying digitalequipment to Kyokuto with the knowledge that it would be exportedto China.   The United States demanded Japan enforce its export controlsafter the Toshiba Machine Co., a subsidiary of the electronicsgiant Toshiba Corp., was charged last year with illegally exportingsophisticated technology to the Soviet Union.   Police raided the three companies charged today on April 5 inresponse to a Ministry of International Trade and Industry request.A ministry official said it had investigated the case independentlybased on tips given by a U.S. government official, whom it declinedto identify.   ``China is coming to be treated differently from the rest of theSoviet bloc countries in terms of export controls,'' said IchiroTakahara, deputy director of export section of the trade ministry.``But there is no excuse on these cases because it evaded theresponsibility of applying for (ministry) permission.''   Takahara said permission would not have been granted because ofrestrictions on the export of the equipment.   Police said Kyokuto Shokai illegally exported 30 digital memorydevices, signal analyzers and sampling oscilloscopes worth about$500,000 to China between June 9, 1985, and June 3, 1986.Authorities allege the equipment was taken to China in hand-carriedluggage when company employees visited there.   Shinsei Koeki allegedly exported four sets of digital memorydevices worth $136,000 to China between July 1986 and November 1986after its export application was rejected, police said.   Defense analysts said the products have limited militaryapplications.   Penalties for the men could vary. Two Toshiba employees weresentenced to two years in prison and fined $80,000 for the sameoffense.</TEXT></DOC>
