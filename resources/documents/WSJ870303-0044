The justices agreed to review the constitutionality of the San Jose, Calif., rent-control law, passed in 1979.    The law permits landlords to raise rents as much as 8% annually, and makes larger increases possible if the landlord applies to a rent-control hearing officer. The hearing officer must consider factors ranging from the landlord's costs to his maintenance record. Among the factors, the law says the hearing officer should consider &quot;the hardship to a tenant.&quot;    The San Jose law was challenged by owners of rental housing. The landlords argued that the law is unconstitutional because it forces them to subsidize low-income renters. This amounts to a &quot;taking&quot; of their property without &quot;just compensation&quot; as required by the Fifth Amendment, the landlords said.    A California trial court and an appeals court declared the San Jose law unconstitutional. But the California Supreme Court upheld the law last August.    Lawyers for the landlords warned that if economic hardship of tenants can be considered, &quot;it follows that the price for any essential goods or services can be based on the financial needs of individual consumers.&quot;    Newspaper Vending Units   The justices agreed to review the authority of cities and towns to regulate the shape and location of newspaper vending machines on public sidewalks.    The court will hear an appeal by the Cleveland suburb of Lakewood in a dispute with Plain Dealer Publishing Co., publisher of the Cleveland Plain Dealer.    Since 1984, Lakewood has prohibited newspaper vending machines in residential areas, and has permitted them in commercial areas only after payment of a $10 rental fee for each site and after complying with architectural standards and assuring the city of liability insurance for the machines.    In a challenge by the Plain Dealer, a federal district court upheld the law. Last July, a federal appeals court in Cincinnati upheld the ban on vending machines in residential areas but struck down the remainder of the law as unconstitutional. The appeals court said the law gave too much unguided discretion to the city over whether to approve specific vending machine sites, as well as specific designs, and that it improperly required newspaper vending machine operators to provide insurance for the city.    The Plain Dealer didn't appeal the residential ban, so the issue in the Supreme Court is whether the Lakewood law is too broad and lacking in standards for commercial areas.    There have been similar disputes in New York and several other major cities.    Missouri River Water   The justices agreed to resolve a dispute over rights to water from the Missouri River stored in the Oahe Reservoir, a federally constructed and managed facility in South Dakota.    In 1982, the Interior Department agreed to provide water from the Oahe Reservoir to Energy Transportation Systems Inc. for use in a proposed coal slurry pipeline from Wyoming to the Gulf Coast. But the states of Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska objected, arguing that the water was intended for irrigation and that Interior Department officials lack the authority to use it for industrial purposes.    A federal district court in Omaha, Neb., ruled that the Interior Department doesn't have the legal authority to permit the water to be used industrially. A federal appeals court in St. Louis agreed. The case was appealed to the high court by the Justice Department and by Energy Transportation Systems.    Jefferson City Cable   The justices let stand a $35.8 million federal court jury award against Tele-Communications Inc. and its TCI Cablevision Inc. and Community Tele-Communications Inc. subsidiaries. The damages were awarded to Central Telecommunications Inc. in a lawsuit over the exclusive cable television franchise for Jefferson City, Mo.    Tele-Communications or a company it acquired held the franchise from 1973 to 1981, but when the franchise was about to run out, the city requested other bids. Other companies made bids, but Tele-Communications refused to do so, arguing that the First Amendment protected its right to provide cable service.    In 1982, the City Council twice voted to give the franchise to Central. But according to an opinion issued last August by the federal appeals court in St. Louis, Tele-Communications began a campaign, including illegal and unethical efforts, to retain the exclusive franchise.    When Tele-Communications finally prevailed, Central sued, charging federal antitrust violations by Tele-Communications as well as illegal interference with Central's business in violation of state law.    A jury in Kansas City, Mo., awarded $10.8 million for the antitrust violations, which, when tripled under federal law equals $32.4 million. The jury also awarded $10.8 million on the state law claims and $25 million in punitive damages.    The trial judge, upheld by the appeals court, ruled that Central was entitled either to the state law damages of $35.8 million or the federal award of $32.4 million, but not both. The Supreme Court refused to hear Tele-Communications' appeal.    In Denver, Tele-Communications' in-house counsel didn't immediately return phone calls seeking comment. </TEXT></DOC>
