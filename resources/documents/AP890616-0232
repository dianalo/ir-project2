(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Goldome bank on Friday rescinded itscontroversial policy of threatening to cut the severance pay oflaid-off workers unless they signed an agreement not to talk aboutlosing their jobs.   ``Our intention, to help assure the confidentiality of employee,customer and corporate information ... has been submerged bymisperceptions of the agreement. This makes its continued usecounterproductive,'' Thomas Cooper, the chief executive, said in astatement.   Cooper said Goldome wants to cut staffing levels by 20 percent,or about 980 jobs nationwide. He said the company has alreadycompleted more than half of the job cuts, either through layoffs,attrition or the sale of business units.   Goldome, one of the nation's largest thrifts, has lost $167million in it last six quarters. Sources within the company saidCooper wanted to keep the layoffs secret so customers would not loseconfidence and withdraw their money.   As many as 150 people had been terminated in the last 10 days andasked to sign the agreement, which prevented them from suing Goldomeor discussing their layoff with anyone except ``counsel, personaltax adviser, immediate family or as required by law.''   If laid-off employees refused to sign, their severance benefitswould have been cut to two weeks pay, down from a maximum of six.   Nearly all of Goldome's laid-off workers signed the agreementbecause they could not afford to lose the money, sources said.   Goldome, based in Buffalo, employs 4,900 nationwide and hasoperations in two dozen states.</TEXT></DOC>
