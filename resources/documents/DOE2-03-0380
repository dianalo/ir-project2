The burst exhibits a clear photospheric expansion atthe peak flux which is probably at the Eddington limit of the underlyingstar. The 0.65-s oscillation was seen in the contracting phase duringwhich the flux stayed at the maximum value. An anticorrelation betweencounts in the low- and high-energy bands was observed during the oscillation.This can be interpreted as a radial oscillation of the envelope whichwas radiating at the Eddington luminosity.</TEXT></DOC>
