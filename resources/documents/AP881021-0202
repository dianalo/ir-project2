The ship, the Admiral Makarov, currently is 300 miles north ofPoint Barrow, said Campbell Plowder of Greenpeace, quoting from ateleprinter message received from the Soviet State Committee onHydrometeorology.   The offer was made in the event the three gray whales still aretrapped by the gathering ice next Wednesday after the Soviet shipcompletes its current missions of establishing a research stationon the ice and rescuing an ice-trapped Soviet ship.   Plowder said that as a shot in the dark, he asked on Monday,through scientific contacts in the Soviet Union, if any Sovieticebreaker was in a position to help the whales. Friday's cable wasthe answer.   Plowder said he now has asked the State Department for immediateclearance for the ship to enter U.S. waters and was told thedepartment would ``assess the technical aspects'' first.   The State Department, meanwhile, said it has asked Sovietauthorities what assets they may have available to help free thewhales.   The Soviets responded with information on where they have icebreakers and how long it would take them to arrive at the scene,said a State Department official who asked not to be identified.   According to the official, U.S. authorities are evaluating theSoviet information and are comparing it with other options forrescuing the whales.</TEXT></DOC>
