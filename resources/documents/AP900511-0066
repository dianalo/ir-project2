At the conclusion of cross-examination, Buckey's lawyer, DannyDavis, asked the girl whether she was sodomized.   ``I don't remember,'' she said.   The 31-year-old Buckey is charged specifically with raping thegirl and using a foreign object to sodomize her.   Clutching a stuffed toy snake, she initially expressed herunwillingness to take the stand Thursday. Then, the youngster saidshe had a stomachache, left the stand and went into a hallway whereshe sat sobbing in her father's arms.   The parents and prosecutors spent an hour with her in private,and she finally returned to finish her testimony.   On Wednesday she had said she was neither sodomized nor raped byBuckey when she attended his family's nursery school in ManhattanBeach.   Another change in her testimony came when Deputy DistrictAttorney Pam Ferrero read to the child sections of her owntestimony before a grand jury and a preliminary hearing six yearsago. The transcripts indicated the girl had used anatomicallyexplicit dolls to show that she was raped and sodomized.   She was then asked whether Buckey hurt her sexually.   ``I don't recall but I remember it did happen,'' she said.   Ms. Ferrero asked no further questions to clarify the answer.   On cross-examination by Davis, the youngster said repeatedly shecould not remember giving any of the earlier testimony nor whetherany of the events she related happened.   She also could not remember that she once described a femaleteacher as lying on top of her nude and women teachers playing``naked games.''   ``I can't remember,'' she answered repeatedly.   Charges against five female teachers, stemming in part fromthose allegations, were dismissed after the preliminary hearing forlack of evidence.   The first Buckey trial, the longest and costliest criminalproceeding in U.S. history, ended in January with Buckey acquittedof 40 counts of molestation at the family-owned preschool. Hismother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, was acquitted of 12 charges.   But the jury deadlocked on 13 counts against Buckey, and thedistrict attorney decided to retry him on eight of those chargesinvolving three children.   The girl who testified Thursday did not appear at the firsttrial, and the jury deadlocked 11-1 for acquittal on the twocharges which involved her.   Ms. Ferrero acknowledged in court that the girl did not want tocome to court at all Thursday, but her parents brought her anyway.   Ms. Ferrero said the girl expressed the desire not to testifywhen she arrived but ``was trying to be cheerful'' and agreed tocooperate.   She said it was difficult to remember events that occurred whenshe was 3 or 4 years old. She will be 12 in July.</TEXT></DOC>
