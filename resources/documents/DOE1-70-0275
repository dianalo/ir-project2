The work has several components: experimentsto understand the mechanisms and kinetics of oil generation, developmentof computer programs for analyzing experiments and applying chemicalkinetics in a geological environment, and comparing predictions of chemical/geologicalmodels to field data. Some aspects of this work are part of a joint researchproject with INTEVEP, S.A., in which model predictions will be testedin the Maracaibo Basin. Other aspects are being done with partial supportfrom an industrial sponsorship program that began this quarter. 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
