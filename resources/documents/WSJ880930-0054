He has slim leads in California, Ohio, New Jersey and Missouri; Dukakis has them in Pennsylvania, Illinois and New York. Michigan is rated even. But Bush is sweeping most of the South; he maintains a solid lead in Texas, where a Bush aide cracks that &quot;Texans are perfectly comfortable keeping Bentsen in the Senate.&quot;    Dukakis will contest only about half the Southern and Border states; he will campaign next week in North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee. He will escalate his populist pitch, contrasting the meager middle-class benefits of Bush's savings plan with the millions the rich would get from the GOP's capital-gains-tax cut.    Bush strategists encourage stories on his &quot;gentler nation&quot; theme even while the candidate savages Dukakis as a left-winger.    PRAGMATISM OR PLOY? U.S. officials debate Iranian intentions.    Even as Iran steps up feelers to the West, administration experts say it continues to back terrorists. &quot;One has seen so far no evidence of a change there,&quot; says counter-terrorism official L. Paul Bremer. Analysts have detected Iranian involvement in several terrorist incidents since the start of peace efforts with Iraq.    The Navy hopes that smooth transits in the Persian Gulf will allow a further scaling back of the forces there, signaling to Iran that good behavior will lower the levels of U.S. military force in the region. But senior U.S. officials quickly reject a plan floated by mid-level State Department aides to shut down the arms embargo known as Operation Staunch.    AMERICA STRUGGLES to maintain its lead role on international economic issues.    Despite new Treasury Secretary Brady's message at the IMF meeting of continued U.S. leadership, the allies show no signs of abandoning their own agenda. West Germany, Japan and Britain probably will gear up a major post-election drive to pressure the new administration into making deep cuts in the budget deficit.    The U.S. position is weakened by its reluctance to put new money into the IMF and World Bank while others invest more, increasing their clout. The day he returned from Germany, Brady had to lobby lawmakers to save proposed new funding for the World Bank. Without the added money, U.S. voting power would have been diluted in favor of Japan.    Germany's powerful central bank chief, Karl Otto Poehl, says the U.S. should &quot;behave like a debtor country and reduce its deficits.&quot;    EXPECTATIONS GAME: Republicans privately expect a big boost for Quayle in next week's debate with Bentsen. They reason that expectations are so low that Quayle can't help but exceed them. The rigid format also helps. &quot;He'll have carefully programmed answers memorized, that he'll give no matter what they ask him,&quot; a top GOP strategist gloats.    BENTSEN MAY FACE debate questions about the nearly $2 million in PAC gifts -- a record -- he has received for his Senate re-election campaign. Recent givers include oil companies, Pentagon suppliers, insurance firms, commodity dealers and law offices with interests before the Finance Committee, which he heads.    DUKAKIS STRATEGISTS believe that their man won the first debate but that they were outgunned in the &quot;spin patrol&quot; claims afterward. They say their mistake was in reacting to the debate itself while the Bush crew stuck to a prearranged line, and they vow to emulate the GOP tactic in next month's final encounter.    BUY PARTISANSHIP: The Realtors PAC spends $1.1 million on independent radio and TV ads for seven favored candidates. Republicans get 55%, including $300,000 for Mississippi Senate contender Lott and $100,000 or so apiece for Reps. Hiler, Emerson and Hansen. But they also spend $200,000 defending Democratic Sen. Melcher and $100,000 each for Reps. Stallings and Campbell.    SLOW START: Thornburgh avoids swift action to revitalize Justice.    The new attorney general declares antidrug programs his top priority, but he hasn't announced any new initiatives and has asserted little influence on legislation. He has said little about bank fraud and securities violations; in the area of civil rights, Norman Chachkin of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund complains, &quot;there doesn't seem to be any change whatsoever&quot; from predecessor Meese.    Aides argue that Thornburgh has resolved several long-simmering bureaucratic disputes and has been more open with Congress and the press. But his strained explanation of why he quit the ACLU undermines his credibility; some senior Justice officials say he must demonstrate a stronger hand soon or be written off as a caretaker.    Some suggest Thornburgh sent a bad signal to the department by taking a vacation shortly after assuming office.    MINOR MEMOS: OMB chief Miller, in Cleveland to counter a Dukakis appearance, uses his Cabinet badge to gain entrance to a closed airport lounge and helps himself to food intended for the Democrats. . . . One way to draw a crowd: Louisiana congressional candidate J.E. Jumonville advertises $4,500 in cash drawings at his campaign appearances. . . . New Dukakis radio ads aimed at black audiences urge listeners to &quot;'Just say no' to George Bush.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
