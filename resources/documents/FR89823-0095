Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from July 31, 1989 through August 11, 1989. The last biweeklynotice was published on August 9, 1989 (54 FR 32704). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By September 22, 1989 the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitionsfor leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filedby the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety andLicensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and theSecretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issuea notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Boston Edison Company, Docket No. 50-293, Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station,Plymouth County, Massachusetts </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>July 31, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment woulddelete the onsite and offsite organization charts and specify general requirementsin place of the deleted charts. The proposed change affects Section 6.0,``Administrative Control'' of the Pilgrim Technical Specifications. Theproposed change is submitted in accordance with the guidance provided inthe NRC Generic Letter (GL) 88-06 dated March 22, 1988. <T3>Basis for proposed no signficant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with a proposed amendment wouldnot: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from an accident previously evaluated; or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee addressed the above three standards in the amendment application.In regard to the three standards, the licensee provided the following analysis.<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The changes proposed to remove corporate and plant organization chartsfrom the Technical Specifications do not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.As stated in NRC Generic Letter 88-06, the requirements necessary for safeoperation of the plant have been retained in the Technical Specifications;the changes do not eliminate or alter the functions previously reviewed;and the changes do not affect plant operation and design or create a newaccident mode. The changes proposed were modeled after Enclosure 2 to NRCGeneric Letter No. 88-06 in conformance with Commission requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Use of the modified specification would not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident than previously evaluated because the proposedchange is administrative in nature and no physical alterations of plantconfiguration or changes to setpoints or operating parameters are proposed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Use of the modified specification would not involve a significantreduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety because Boston Edison, through its quality assuranceprograms, its commitment to maintain only qualified personnel in positionsof responsibility, and other required controls, assures that safety functionswill be performed at a high level of competence. Therefore, removal ofthe organization charts from the Technical Specifications will not affectthe margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination analysis. Based upon this review, the staff agrees with thelicensee's analysis. Therefore, based on its review, the staff proposesto determine that the proposed change does not involve a significant hazardsconsideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Plymouth Public Library,11 North Street, Plymouth, Massachusetts 02360 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>W. S. Stowe, Esq., Boston Edison Company,800 Boylston Street, 36th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02199 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Richard H. Wessman <ITAG tagnum="84">Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket Nos. 50-003 and 50-247,Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Westchester County,New York </ITAG><T3>Date of amendments request: </T3>July 25, 1989 <T3>Description of amendments request: </T3>The proposed amendments wouldrevise the ``Indian Point Station Units 1 and 2 Physical Security Plan''to (1) redefine several vital areas of Indian Point 2 as Type I ratherthan Type II and vice versa, (2) make several changes for clarificationand standardization of terminology, (3) remove several items from the listof vital equipment but not actually remove the equipment from vital areas,and (4) remove the City Water Tank from the list of vital equipment anddelete its vital area. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The licensee provided the following analysis of the proposed changes:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofthe standards for determining whether ``significant hazards considerations''exist by providing certain examples at 51 FR 7744 (March 6, 1986). Example(i) of 51 FR 7744 which applies to editorial changes, states: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``(i) a purely administrative change to technical specifications:for example, a change to achieve consistency throughout the technical specifications,correction of an error, or a change in nomenclature.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although the example cited in 51 FR 7744 refers specifically to proposedchange to technical specifications, it is understood that the intent ofthe guidance is that it apply to license amendment changes, in general,including Physical Security Plan changes such as proposed herein. Withthe exception of the proposed change to delete the City Water Tank fromTable 3.2, the changes to the Physical Security Plan proposed in this applicationare shown not to involve a significant hazards consideration by reasonof the guidance in example (i) above since they amount to merely administrativechanges such that there are no functional alternatives being made. Notethat the level of security afforded Type I and Type II vital areas at IndianPoint is identical and this policy will not change without another amendmentrequest. Likewise, the deletion of items, other than the City Water Tank,from the list of vital equipment will not alter their physical locationwithin vital areas. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Concerning the remaining proposed change, the Commission has providedstandards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determining whether a significant hazardsconsideration exists. A proposed amendment to an operating license fora facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operationof the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1)involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3)involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed amendmentshave been evaluated below and determined not to involve a Significant HazardsConsideration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Do the proposed changes involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">No. The City Water Tank is utilized for normal plant operation andmay be used as a backup to safety equipment cooling. Its damage or destructionwould not cause or increase the probability or consequences of an accidentsince safety-related vital equipment would not be affected by such sabotageand would, therefore, remain operable. Therefore, since sabotage in a non-vitalarea can be assumed to be successful but safety-related equipment in vitalareas is assumed to operate as required, the deletion of this item fromthe list of vital equipment would not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Do the proposed changes create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">No. Deletion of this item from the vital equipment list implies thatwe must assume its inoperability in the event of successful sabotage. Suchinoperability, caused by damage or destruction, would be serious enoughto cause reactor shutdown as required by Technical Specifications but wouldnot result in any previously unanalyzed accident. Overall plant designis such that adequate safety-related equipment and cooling to that equipmentexists to bring the plant to a safe shutdown and assure that escalationof an accident beyond the damage to this non-vital piece of equipment wouldnot occur. Successful sabotage of the item deleted from the list of vitalequipment with this proposed revision would, therefore, not create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Do the proposed changes involve a significant reduction in themargin of safety? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">No. Deletion of this item from the vital equipment list and its subsequentinoperability or destruction due to successful sabotage could yield a forcedplant shutdown as required by Technical Specifications. The other consequencesof such sabotage would be the elimination of certain backup systems whichare not required or relied upon for accident prevention or mitigation purposes.This effect would not be a significant one since the functionally equivalentsafety-related vital equipment would not be adversely affected. Therefore,the overall margin of safety would not be significantly reduced. </ITAG>The staff agrees with the licensee's analysis. Therefore, based on theabove, the staff proposes that the proposed amendment will not involvea Significant Hazards Consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>White Plains Public Library,100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York, 10610. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Brent L. Brandenburg, Esq., 4 Irving Place,New York, New York 10003 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Robert A. Capra <ITAG tagnum="84">Duquesne Light Company, Docket No. 50-412, Beaver Valley Power Station,Unit No. 2, Shippingport, Pennsylvania </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>July 27, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldrevise Section 4.7.12 of the Technical Specifications to relax the surveillancefrequency of failed snubbers resulting from isolated damage events thatcannot be related generically to other snubbers. Specifically, the proposedchanges would eliminate the requirement to reduce the surveillance intervalsfor cases that result from isolated damage. In addition, another changewould permit either satisfactory functional test result, or applied remedybe the basis to declare snubbers as operable for the purpose of establishingthe next inspection interval. Both these changes have been implementedin the Unit 1 Technical Specifications. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significanthazard consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with theproposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. The proposed changes do not involve any changes to plant hardware or operatingprocedures. All snubbers and related components will continue to be visuallyand functionally inspected in accordance with the current specifications,and hence the overall operability of the snubbers are not affected. Thusthe answers to the first 2 criteria are negative. None of the previoussafety analyses are affected, and no safety assumptions need to be changed.Thus the answer to criterion (3) is also negative. The staff thereforeproposes to determine that the requested amendment involves no significanthazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>B. F.

The licensee provided the following discussion regarding the above threecriteria: <ITAG tagnum="21">Criterion 1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The bases for Technical Specifications 3.7.1.5 for Units 1 and 2 andTechnical Specification 3.7.1.6 for Unit 2, state that the main steam isolationvalves and main feedwater isolation valves are maintained in the closedposition to ensure that the consequences of an excess steam demand eventare limited. With the main steam line isolation valves and the main feedwaterline isolation valves maintained closed the functional design bases underaccident conditions are met by prohibiting the blowdown of both steam generatorsand ensuring that all main feedwater flow is stopped. Therefore, the potentialfor excessive cooldown of the reactor coolant system, and the accompanyingreturn to power from subcritical conditions, are reduced by the proposedlicense amendment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Adding the statement regarding the inapplicability of Technical Specification3.0.4 to the Unit 1 MSIV specification is administrative in nature, andbrings the Unit 1 specification into agreement with the Combustion Engineering(CE) Standard Technical Specifications.

Overpressurization of themain steam lines when the main steam line isolation valves are closed isprevented by the safety valves on the main steam lines. The availabilityof feedwater to the steam generators is ensured by the operability requirementsfor the auxiliary feedwater system. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Allowing Unit 1 to change modes while both main steam line isolationvalves are closed is in accordance with the CE Standard Technical Specifications,and will not create the potential for a new or different kind of accidentor event. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Criterion 3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Use of the modified specification would not involve a significantreduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By maintaining the main steam line and main feedwater isolation valvesin a closed position, the potential consequences of a steam line breakevent are minimized, and the margins of safety provided in the accidentanalyses of record are increased. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Based upon the above, we have determined that the amendment requestdoes not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesor an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any previously evaluated, or (3) involvea significant reduction in a margin of safety, and therefore does not involvea significant hazards consideration. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

Item 3 of Attachment 5 to the license specifies the schedulefor implementation of modifications (installations or upgrade) for neutronflux monitoring consistent with the guidance of Regulatory Guide 1.97,Revision 2 or the NRC Staff's Safety Evaluation Report (SER) of the BWROwners Group (BWROG) Licensing Topical Report (NEDO-31558, Position onNRC Regulatory Guide 1.97, Revision 3, Requirements for Post-Accident NeutronMonitoring System). The current schedule, as established by Amendment No.28 to the license, states that modifications, if required shall be completedbefore restart from the next refueling outage starting after 10 monthsfrom the date of receipt of the NRC Staff SER on NEDO-31558, but no laterthan January 1, 1991 unless otherwise notified in writing by the NRC staff.The proposed change would modify the implementation schedule to state thatmodifications, if required, shall be completed before restart from thenext refueling outage starting after 18 months from the date of receiptof the NRC Staff SER on NEDO-31558. The licensee's submittal indicatesthat the reason for the proposed change is that an 18-month period is requiredfrom initial specification release to completed installation of the neutronmonitoring system (NMS). <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee provided an analysis that addressed the above three standardsin the amendment application. <ITAG tagnum="21">1. No significant increase in the probability or the consequencesof an accident previously evaluated results from this proposed change because:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is no change in system design or operation. The license conditioncurrently requires upgrade of NMS during the third refueling outage. Thisproposed change will allow operation with the currently installed NMS whichhas been found to comply with all criteria proposed in the BWROG letter.This system is required to provide neutron flux indication and is not postulatedto initiate any accidents. The NMS is used to verify reactor shutdown aspart of the Emergency Operating Procedures (EOPs). The use of neutron monitoringin the EOPs is conservative in that, if it is not available, actions arespecified which will lead to safe shutdown without the system. The requirementsof RG 1.97 concerning neutron monitoring are additions to the existingsystem abilities. Therefore, delay in upgrade to RG 1.97 requirements willnot significantly increase the probability of an accident and would notlead to an increase in the consequences of an accident as defined in thesafety analysis because of the conservative EOP actions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. This proposed change will not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident than any previously evaluated because: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The current system has been evaluated using alternate criteria proposedin NEDO-31558 and found acceptable for continued operation. This changedoes not involve any changes to design or operation. In addition, the neutronmonitoring system is not postulated as the initiator of any accidents.Therefore, no new or different accidents are created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3.

EOP actions are conservative with respect to the use of theNMS for verification that the reactor is shutdown. When not available duringan accident or transient scenario, actions are specified which will leadto safe reactor shutdown. Because these actions lead to a safe plant condition(reactor shutdown), the margin of safety is not reduced.

The licensee has provided an analysis of no significant hazards considerationin its request for a license amendment. The licensee has concluded thatthe TS change does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated because this changeto the TS would resolve an inconsistency in the instrument setpoint dealingwith the control of the containment spray system at primary containmentpressures below 2 psig. The resolution of the inconsistency would not increasethe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The licensee has concluded that the TS change would not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident because this change would resolvean inconsistency in the TS to reflect an accident that has previously beenevaluated in the FSAR. Therefore, no possibility of a new or differentkind of accident would be created by the TS modification. Finally, the licensee has concluded that the TS change would not involvea significant reduction in the margin of safety because the proposal wouldnot change the original margin of safety.

A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The staff has reviewed the licensee's submittal and concludes: 1. The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposedamendment, will not involve a significant increase in the probability orconsequences of an accident previously evaluated because the deleted surveillancerequirements will not have an adverse effect upon the ability of the ControlRod Block circuitry to perform its intended safety function. The SRM and IRM systems provide multi-channel monitoring of the core thermalneutron flux during startup and low power operation. In addition, the SRMand IRM systems will initiate a rod withdrawal block for high neutron fluxor channel malfunction conditions. Both the SRM and the IRM systems provideDetector Not In Startup Position, Inoperative and Upscale trip signalsto the control rod withdrawal block circuitry and the IRM system providesa Downscale trip signal. The SRM and the IRM Detector Not in Startup Position instrument channelsinitiate a control rod block to ensure that control rods are not withdrawnunless the appropriate detectors are properly positioned and capable ofproviding the operator and the circuitry with neutron flux information.The licensee has indicated that the design of these instrument channelsdoes not allow the output of the detector to be varied in response to avariable test signal. Therefore, since the trip is either on or off inresponse to the detector position switch, it cannot be calibrated. Theproposed change to delete the requirement to calibrate this function willnot affect the ability of the rod block to function as required, sincethe performance of the associated functional tests at the existing TechnicalSpecification required frequency verifies operability of the rod blockfunction. Also, preventive maintenance realignment of the detector retractionmechanism limit switches each refueling outage ensures proper detectorand position switch alignment. An SRM and IRM instrument channel inoperative rod block is initiated onlow detector voltage, electronics drawer internal module unplugged, orthe channel mode switch not in the Operate position. Since none of theseinputs require calibration, the proposed change to delete the surveillancerequirement to calibrate the instrument channel Inoperative function willnot affect their ability to initiate a rod block when required. Additionally,the functional tests on the instrument channels at the existing TechnicalSpecification required frequency ensures operability of the rod block function.The rod block instrument channels are digital/bistable channels and theiroutput signal is either present or absent depending upon the state of thesensor. Because the conditions that generate an output signal (high neutronflux or channel malfunction) are received only when the event is present,a qualitative determination of acceptable operability by observation orcomparison with other independent sensors measuring the same variable (i.e.,a sensor check) is not possible. Therefore, the proposed change to deletethe sensor check requirement for the SRM and IRM instrument channels willnot affect the ability of the channels to perform as required. A control rod withdrawal block functions to prevent control rod withdrawalonly. Therefore, the change to delete the requirement to calibrate theSRM and IRM rod withdrawal block instrument channels prior to shutdown(rod insertion) does not affect the ability of these channels to performas required. A proposed administrative change to Note (g) of Table 4.6.2g reflects theabove proposed changes to Table 4.6.2g. In summary, the proposed changes do not affect the analyses of abnormaloperational transients or design basis accidents as presented in SectionXV of the Final Safety Analysis Report. The proposed changes do not changethe design or operation of the detector or instrumentation and, therefore,do not increase the probability or consequences of any accident previouslyevaluated. 2. The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposedamendment, will not create the possibility of a new or different kind ofaccident from any accident previously evaluated since the proposed changesdo not alter the design or operation of the detector or instrumentationsystems. 3. The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposedamendment, will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safetybecause, as discussed previously, the deleted surveillance requirementsare unnecessary and do not affect the ability of the Control Room Blockcircuitry to function as required. Specifically, the SRM and the IRM Detector Not In Startup Position rodblock instrument channel calibrations required by the existing TechnicalSpecification are being deleted because the design of the instrumentationdoes not facilitate calibration. The performance of functional tests onthe instrument channels and preventive maintenance checks of the detectorlimit switches presently required by the Technical Specifications adequatelyensures instrument operability and alignment, respectively. Calibrationof the SRM and the IRM instrument channel inoperative rod block requiredby the existing Technical Specification is not necessary because the channelinputs do not require calibration. The sensor checks required by the Technical Specifications are not applicablebecause sensor checks cannot be performed on the digital/bistable outputsfrom the SRM and IRM sensors that initiate control rod blocks (detectornot in startup position, inoperative, upscale and downscale). The requirement to calibrate Control Rod Withdrawal instrumentation priorto shutdown (control rod insertion) is not necessary since control rodwithdrawal blocks are only applicable for rod withdrawal. Based upon the above, the staff proposes that the amendment will not involvea significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Reference and Documents Department,Penfield Library, State University of New York, Oswego, New York 13126.<T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Troy B.

Thelicensee states that these proposed amendments are based on and are consistentwith the NRC Safety Evaluation Report issued to J. S. Charnley on December27, 1987, which approved Amendment 17 of General Electric Topical ReportNEDE-24011-P-A, ``General Electric Standard Application for Reactor Fuel''.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licenseehas provided a discussion of the proposed changes as they relate to thesestandards; the discussion is presented below. Standard 1: The proposed revisions do not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.<ITAG tagnum="21">Deleting the RSCS and changing the low power set point on the RWMhas no effect on the probability of equipment malfunction in other systemsor within the RWM. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The probability of occurrence of an accident is not affected by thischange. The probability of an RDA is dependent only on the control roddrive system and mechanisms themselves, and not in any way on the RSCSor RWM. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The consequences of an RDA as evaluated in the PBAPS UFSAR will notbe affected by this modification. An extensive probabilistic study wasperformed by the NRC staff (letter and enclosure from B. C. Rusche, NRR,to R. Fraley, ACRS, dated June 1, 1976, ``Generic Item IIA-2 Control RodDrop Accident (BWRs)''). This study indicated that there was not a needfor the RSCS. Furthermore, improved methodologies in the RDA analysis methods(e.g. BNL-NUREG 28109, ``Thermal-Hydraulic Effects on Center Rod Drop Accidentsin a Boiling Water Reactor,'' October 1980) indicated that the peak fuelenthalpies resulting from an RDA are significantly lower than previouslydetermined by less refined methodologies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The RSCS duplicates the function of the RWM. So long as the RWM isoperable, the RSCS is not needed since the RWM prevents control rod patternerror. In the event the RWM is out of service, after the withdrawal ofthe first 12 control rods, the proposed Technical Specifications requirethat control rod withdrawal movement and compliance with the prescribedcontrol rod pattern be verified by a second licensed operator or technicallyqualified member of the station technical staff. The verification processis controlled procedurally to ensure a high quality, independent reviewof control rod movement. In addition, to further minimize control rod movementat low power with the RWM out of service, the proposed Technical Specificationswill permit only one plant start-up per calendar year with the RWM outof service prior to or during the withdrawal of the first twelve controlrods. All the above taken together demonstrate consistency and applicabilityto those conclusions reached in the referenced NRC SER, and substantiatethe conclusion that there will be no increase in the consequences of anRDA as evaluated in the FSAR as a result of eliminating the RSCS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There will also be no increase in the consequences of an RDA as evaluatedin the UFSAR due to lowering the RWM set point from 25% to 10%. The effectsof an RDA are more severe at low power levels and are less severe as powerlevel increases. Although the original calculations for the RDA were performedat 10% power, the NRC required that the generic BWR Technical Specificationsbe written to require operation of the RWM below 25% power in order toensure conservatism. However, GE continued to perform the RDA analysesat and below 10% power because these produced more conservative analyticalresults. More refined calculations by BNL (BNL-NUREG 28109, ``Thermal-HydraulicEffects on Center Rod Drop Accidents in a Boiling Water Reactor,'' October1980) have shown that even with the maximum single control rod positionerror, and most multiple control rod error patterns, the peak fuel rodenthalpy reached during an RDA from these control rod patterns would notexceed the NRC limit of 280 cal/gm for RDAs above 10% power, confirmingthe original GE analyses. Hence, lowering the RWM set point from 25% to10% will not result in an increase in the consequences of an RDA as evaluatedin the UFSAR. The previously referenced NRC SER has concluded this RWMset point reduction to be acceptable. </ITAG>Standard 2: The proposed revisions do not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <ITAG tagnum="21">Operation of the RSCS and RWM cannot cause or prevent an accident.They function to minimize the consequences of an RDA. The RDA is alreadyevaluated in the UFSAR, and the effect of this proposed change on the analysesis discussed in Item 1 above. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Elimination of the RSCS and lowering the RWM set point will have noimpact on the operation of any other systems, and hence would not contributeto a malfunction in any other equipment nor create the possibility foran accident to occur which has not already been evaluated. </ITAG>Standard 3: The proposed revisions do not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. <ITAG tagnum="21">Elimination of the RSCS will not lower the margin of safety for thereasons discussed in Item 1 above and summarized below: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a) An extensive NRC study has determined that the possibility of anRDA resulting in unacceptable consequences is so low as to negate the requirementfor the RSCS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b) Recent calculations have determined that the consequences of anRDA are acceptable above 10% power. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c) The RSCS is redundant in function to the RWM.

Changing the channel description format for item 7.a of Table 3.3-3,Loss of Voltage, to specify that the total number of channels is 1 perbus. 2. For Item 7.b of Table 3.3-3, Sustained Degraded Voltage, changing theTotal Number of Channels, Channels to Trip and Minimum Channels Operableto 3 per bus, 2 per bus and 3 per bus, respectively. 3. For Item 7.b of Table 3.3-4, Sustained Degraded Voltage, changing theTrip Setpoint to greater than or equal to 91.6 percent of bus voltage forless than or equal to 13 seconds and changing the Allowable Values to greaterthan or equal to 91 percent of bus voltage for less than or equal to 15seconds. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>Item 1, Table 3.3-3 Item 7.a This item is being revised to be consistent with the channel descriptionformat used for other items in this Table. This is an editorial changeonly. No modification is being made to the primary undervoltage protectionsystem. Item 2, Table 3.3-3 Item 7.b The second level undervoltage protection system has been redesigned asa result of an event which occurred at Salem Unit No. 2 on August 26, 1986.Immediately following a reactor trip with safety injection, the Unit 2vital buses began flip-flopping between the No. 21 and 22 Station PowerTransformers (SPT) (preferred source of power) until they eventually separatedfrom the offsite power system. The previous design provided for the transferof a vital bus to the alternate SPT whenever the secondary voltage forits designated SPT dropped below 91 percent of rated bus voltage for greaterthan 10 seconds. This function was controlled by 2 relays on each vitalbus. These relays were positioned such that they monitor the secondaryvoltage of each of the SPT (1 per SPT). In addition to initiating the transferfunction these relays provided a transfer permissive signal such that avital bus could not be transferred unless the alternate SPT has an acceptablesecondary voltage. A separate relay monitored vital bus voltage and providedan input to each of the three Safeguards Equipment Controllers (SEC) suchthat, for a sustained degraded voltage (less than 91 percent for greaterthan 13 seconds) condition on 2 out of 3 vital buses, all vital buses wereseparated from the offsite source and sequenced onto the emergency source.As redesigned, the transfer function was eliminated. The existing transferrelays were replaced with relays of similar design but with improved setpointdrift characteristics. These new relays (1 per bus) were connected to operatein parallel with the previous vital bus degraded voltage relay. The previousvital bus degraded voltage relay was also replaced with an upgraded relay.The interface with the SEC was then reconfigured from its previous 2 outof 3 bus design to a 2 out of 3 relay per bus design. A failure analysishas been completed by the licensee for each component in the system anddemonstrates that no single failure will result in the creation of an unanalyzedcondition. The new configuration: (1) eliminates the possibility of vitalbus flip-flopping, (2) provides for the separation of the vital buses fromthe preferred source on an individual basis only, and (3) satisfies GeneralDesign Criterion 17 relative to maintaining the connection between theoffsite source and the onsite distribution system. Item 3, Table 3.3-4 Item 7.b This table is being revised to: (1) incorporate the revised trip setpointfor the second level undervoltage protection relays, and (2) to correctthe allowable value for second level undervoltage protection. The presentTechnical Specification allowable value for second level undervoltage protectionis in error as it does not reflect an allowance for line loss due to cablelength (about 0.7 percent). However, the present trip setpoint for thesecond level undervoltage protection system (equal to or greater than 91percent) provides sufficient margin to account for these losses. The newtrip setpoint of greater than or equal to 91.6 percent is based on theresults of detailed analyses of the Salem Generating Station electricaldistribution system transient response characteristics. Those analysesindicate that, at the Public Service Electric and Gas (PSEandamp;G) bulkpower system minimum expected value of 505 KV and for a LOCA on one SalemUnit and a concurrent orderly shutdown of the other Unit, vital bus voltagewill recover to a worse case value of about 92.9 percent. The minimum allowabletrip value and trip setpoint are derived using the 90 percent minimum motorterminal voltage requirement as a starting point, and then applying appropriateallowances as provided in Regulatory Guide 1.105. The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 1. For Item 7.b of Table 3.3-3, the licensee has analyzed the proposedamendment to determine if a significant hazard exists: <ITAG tagnum="21">1) The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in theprobability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.The failure analysis [performed by the licensee] demonstrates that no singlefailure results in the existence of an unanalyzed condition. Additionally,the second level undervoltage protection system does not provide an inputto the Reactor Protection System nor can it cause any one of the incoming500 KV sources to be isolated from the Salem Station electrical distributionsystem. All equipment used in the system will be seismically qualified.Therefore, the probability of occurrence of an accident remains unchanged.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The second level undervoltage system is required to protect againstthose events (e.g. bulk power system degradation) which result in a degradedvoltage at the vital buses but which do not result in a complete loss ofvoltage. The modified system continues to satisfy this requirement as previouslydiscussed. Additionally, by eliminating the ability to transfer betweenSPTs, the potential for damage to safety related motors from frequent startsis eliminated. The increased redundancy in the SEC logic inputs providesgreater assurance that the system will perform its intended function. Therefore,the consequences of previously analyzed accidents remain unchanged. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2) The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. As demonstratedin [the failure analysis], no single failure will result in the existenceof an unanalyzed condition. The second level undervoltage system does notprovide any input to the Reactor Protection System nor can it cause anyone of the incoming 500 KV sources to be isolated from the Salem Stationelectrical distribution system. The modified design eliminates the possibilityof flip-flopping of the vital buses between offsite power sources and therebyassures the availability of all safety related equipment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3) The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety. The changes to the second level undervoltage systemmaintain the existing margin of safety by eliminating the transfer betweenoffsite sources, thereby assuring that the integrity of safety relatedelectrical equipment is maintained. The additional redundancy providedin the revised design enhances the overall reliability of the system andfurther assures that the system function will be completed. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's significant hazards considerationdetermination analysis for the changes associated with Item 7.b of Table3.3-3 and concurs with the licensee's determination that the proposed changesdo not involve a significant hazards consideration. 2. With respect to the proposed change to Item 7.a of Table 3.3-3 and Item7.b of Table 3.3-4, the Commission has provided guidance concerning theapplication of its standards set forth in 10 CFR 50.92 by providing certainexamples (51 FR 7751). One of the examples, (i), of an amendment likelyto involve no significant hazards consideration relates to ``A purely administrativechange to technical specifications: for example, a change to achieve consistencythroughout the technical specifications, correction of an error or a changein nomenclature.'' Another example, (ii), of an amendment likely to involve no significanthazards consideration relates to ``A change that constitutes an additionallimitation, restriction, or control not presently included in the technicalspecifications, e.g., a more stringent surveillance requirement.'' (a) Item 7.a of Table 3.3-3 The change from 3 to 1 per bus is a change in nomenclature. There are 3buses, each equipped with a shutdown channel so the change to 1 per busmeets example (i). (b) Table 3.3-4, Item 7.b, Allowable Value The current Technical Specifications do not take into account the lineloss (voltage drop) because of cable length. This change will correct thatand therefore, meets example (i). (c) Table 3.3-4, Item 7.b Trip Setpoint Changing the value from greater than or equal to 91 percent to greaterthan or equal to 91.6 percent is a more stringent requirement. Thereforethis change meets example (ii). Based on the above the staff proposes to determine that the changes toTable 3.3-3, Item 7.a and Table 3.3-4, Item 7.b do not involve a significanthazards consideration because they change the nomenclature, correct anerror or provide a more stringent requirement. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Salem Free Public library,112 West Broadway, Salem, New Jersey 08079 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mark J.

By letter dated May 22, 1989, the licensee proposed to modify SurveillanceRequirement 4.1.3.4 and 4.1.3.5 by adding a footnote as follows: **Forpower levels below 50 percent one hour thermal ``soak time'' is permitted.During this soak time, the absolute value of rod motion is limited to sixsteps. This is applicable prior to verification of rod positions. The original request, dated June 23, 1988, was noticed on January 11, 1989(54 FR 1024). <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The licensee's January 26, 1989 letter withdrew a proposed changein Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.4.a that would have replaced ``Within15 minutes prior to withdrawal of any rods in control banks A, B, C orD during an approach to reactor critically (sic)'' with ``Within 15 minutesprior to withdrawal of any control bank during an approach to reactor critcally(sic)''. Because this change was not discussed in the licensee's June 23,1988 application the licensee was asked to justify the change. The licenseechose to withdraw the change. Therefore, no change is being proposed tothis section. The original application would have, among other things, deleted any referenceto a waiting period before rod position verification after rod motion.Because individual rod position indication is subject to thermal transients,it is important that thermal equilibrium be achieved before rod positionverification at power levels below 50 percent. In their May 22, 1989 letter,the licensee opted to include a footnote to Surveillance Requirements 4.1.3.4and 4.1.3.5 to allow a one-hour thermal soak period before rod positionverification to allow thermal equilibrium to be reached at powers below50 percent. Also, during the soak time rod motion would be limited to sixsteps absolute. For powers above 50 percent, rod motion is expected tobe small and will not induce significant thermal transients. In the initial application the licensee had determined that the proposedchange did not constitute a significant hazards consideration. The staffreviewed the licensee's analysis and concurred with the licensee's determinationthat the proposed amendment did not involve a significant hazards consideration.The staff had proposed to determine that the proposed amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration [54 FR 1024 dated January 11, 1989].The licensee has reviewed the original Significant Hazards Considerationand determined: The proposed changes do not affect the previously submittedSignificant Hazards Consideration.

Therefore, in accordancewith 10 CFR 50.91 and 10 CFR 50.92, the licensee has performed and providedthe following analysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. This proposed change does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The design basis accident during core alterations is the droppingof a fuel assembly. Since these changes increase the monitoring requirementsfor core alterations and there is no new fuel handling activity introducedthat was not previously allowed by the current technical specifications,there is no increase in the probability or consequence of the dropped assemblyaccident. These changes do not increase the probability or consequencesof a control rod removal error or a fuel rod assembly insertion error.There is no increased probability or consequences of an accidental reactivityinsertion or an inadvertent criticality. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.

There are no new activitiesrequired during core alterations due to these proposed changes which couldintroduce any new or different accident. The deletion of the two optionsof loading fuel without continuous SRM monitoring will require the useof fuel load chambers (FLCs) during part of the fuel loading. FLCs havebeen used during 13 previous fuel loadings at BFN. The proposed clarificationof the TS allowing the SRM count rate to decrease below 3 cps during thespecial conditions specified for complete core unloading do not changethe intent of the current TS. The Control Rods are fully inserted in thecore and are electrically disarmed and cannot be moved. Therefore, no reactivitycan be added by control rod movement. In addition, any fuel movements wouldbe to remove a fuel assembly from the reactor core. In either case, nocore alterations will be made that would increase core reactivity. Allother changes are more conservative than the current TS requirements oncore alterations, including normal control rod movement. Therefore, thepossibility of a new kind of accident is not created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3.

The proposed changes areconservative by requiring continuous SRM monitoring during core alterationswhich could add reactivity. In addition, the requirements for control rodwithdrawal with the vessel head removed will be considered as a core alterationwhich is also more conservative than the current TS. The use of SRMs forcore monitoring during core alterations is not taken credit for in anymargin of safety as defined in the TS bases. Since these proposed TS changesare more restrictive, they will not result in the reduction of any marginof safety as defined in the TS bases. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

The amendment requestis to put the operability requirement for this wide range flux monitoringsystem into Technical Specification Table 3.3.7.5-1, ``Accident MonitoringInstrumentation.'' Surveillance requirements for the wide range monitorwould be put into Table 4.3.7.5-1, ``Accident Monitoring InstrumentationSurveillance Requirements.'' Under accident conditions the wide range monitoringsystem will replace three other neutron flux monitoring systems. Requirementsfor the average power range monitor (APRM), the intermediate range monitor(IRM), and the source range monitor (SRM) would be removed from these twotables. The licensee has also requested a change to the Action Statement to beimplemented in the event of inoperability of the wide range flux monitoringsystem. The current action statement to be applied when the neutron fluxmonitors are inoperable would require repair or shutdown within a specifiedtime. The proposed action statement would allow use of an alternate samplingmethod instead of shutdown in the event of inoperability of the wide rangesystem. The alternate sampling method would utilize the APRM, the IRM,and the SRM. By letter dated November 18, 1986 the licensee notified the NRC that theinstallation of the wide range monitoring system would take place duringthe 1987 refueling outage and requested that the technical specificationsbe revised to incorporate the requirements for this new system. Noticeof consideration of issuance of this amendment was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 8, 1987 (52 FR 11377). The licenseeexperienced a number of difficulties in demonstrating the environmentalqualifications of the system and asked to defer action on the November1986 request. Because of the significant lapse in time, on May 17, 1989the NRC notified the licensee that the November 18, 1986 request was beingdenied. Subsequently the licensee resolved the environmental qualificationproblems. The June 15, 1989 amendment request seeks the exact changes sought in theNovember 18, 1986 request. The licensee declared that the statements madein the 1986 letter are still accurate and applicable including their argumentssupporting the determination of no significant hazards. Therefore, theNovember 18, 1986 letter will be considered as part of the amendment request.<T3>Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has determined and the staff agrees, that the requested amendmentper 10 CFR 50.92 does not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated because the equipment installed will notprovide input to any safety systems relied upon in the licensing basesaccident analyses. The change in action statements does not significantlyincrease the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedbecause the redundant APRM, IRM, and SRM monitors presently in use willbe available should the wide range monitors be declared inoperable. (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident thanpreviously evaluated because the equipment provides monitoring only andmerely provides another display that indicates neutron flux or power levelsin addition to the existing devices currently relied upon. The change inaction statements does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident because the equipment provides a monitoring function onlyand has adequate redundancy with the existing APRM, IRM, and SRM monitorsso that no new or different kind of accident is credible. (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because no safetymargins are affected. This wide range monitoring equipment provides a passivemonitoring function only and is not part of any plant safety related system,thus safety margins will not be affected. The change in action statementsdoes not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety because theexisting redundant monitors provide adequate backup given the remote possibilitythat both wide range monitors become inoperable. Based on the above considerations the Commission proposes to determinethat the requested change to the WNP-2 Technical Specifications involvesno significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Richland City Library, Swiftand Northgate Streets, Richland, Washington 99352. <T3>Attorneys for licensees: </T3>Nicholas S.

Knighton <ITAG tagnum="84">Yankee-Rowe Nuclear Power Corporation, Docket No. 50-029, Yankee-RoweNuclear Power Station, Bolton, Massachusetts </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>July 24, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment consistsof two proposed changes: (1) The proposed amendment modifes Table 3.2-1of Technical Specification 3.2.4 to substitute a limit on the operatingloop average temperature for the current limit on cold leg temperature.The proposed average temperature limit will allow greater operational flexibilityduring part-load operation and will maintain DNB margins to be boundedby full power conditions. (2) The proposed amendment removes the word ``Exxon''from the last paragraph of Technical Specification Base 3/4.2.4. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with a proposed amendment wouldnot: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from an accident previously evaluated, or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standardsin 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined the following for the first proposedchange: <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) An increase in temperature will not increase the probability ofan accident. The main steam line break is the only licensing analysis affectedby the change. The reanalysis of this event has shown that the consequencesremain acceptable. Therefore, there is not a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of a previously analyzed event. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) An increase in temperature will not result in a new failure mechanismwhich could initiate an accident. Therefore, the proposed change will notcreate the possibility of a new or different type of accident from anypreviously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The steady-state DNBR margin has been evaluated at part-load conditionswith the increased cold leg temperatures allowed by this change. The DNBperformance at reduced load is bounded by the limiting full power condition.The transient licensing analyses were also evaluated, with the main steamline break being the only affected event. Reanalysis of this transienthas shown that the results will remain acceptable. Therefore, this changewill not result in a significant decrease in safety margins. </ITAG>For the second proposed change: This change is editorial in nature andwould not: <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. Based on this review,the staff therefore determines that the proposed amendment does not involvea significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Brooks Memorial Library,224 Main Street, Brattleboro, Vermont 05301. <T3>Attorney for Licensee: </T3>John A.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particularfacility involved. A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By September 22, 1989, the licenseemay file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendmentto the subject facility operating license and any person whose interestmay be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a partyin the proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene.Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filedin accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic LicensingProceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petitionfor leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or anAtomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by theChairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on therequest and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held wouldtake place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or theAtomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or request shouldbe granted based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v)and 2.714(d). <ITAG tagnum="84">Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, IndianPoint Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester County, New York </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendment: </T3>August 3, 1989. <T3>Brief description of amendment: </T3>The amendment raises the maximumallowed service water system inlet water temperature from 85anddegrees; Fto 90anddegrees; F and raises the allowable containment air temperature from120anddegrees; F to 130anddegrees; F. <T3>Date of issuance: </T3>August 7, 1989 <T3>Effective date: </T3>August 7, 1989 <T3>Amendment No.: </T3>143 <T3>Facility Operating License No. DPR-26: </T3>Amendment revised the TechnicalSpecifications. <T3>Public comments requested as to proposed no significant hazards consideration:</T3>No. The Commission's related evaluation of the amendment, findingof emergency circumstances, and final determination of no significant hazardsconsideration are contained in a Safety Evaluation dated August 7, 1989.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>White Plains Public Library,100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York 10610. <ITAG tagnum="84">Power Authority of The State of New York, Docket No. 50-286, IndianPoint Unit No. 3, Westchester County, New York </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendment: </T3>August 4, 1989 <T3>Brief description of amendment: </T3>The amendment revises TechnicalSpecification 3 to permit the plant to operate with a service water temperatureabove 90anddegrees; F with containment air temperatures up to 130anddegrees;F for up to seven hours before reaching the hot shutdown condition vianormal operation procedures. <T3>Date of issuance: </T3>August 11, 1989 <T3>EFfective date: </T3>August 11, 1989 <T3>Amendment No.: </T3>87 <T3>Facility Operating License No. DPR-64: </T3>Amendment revised the TechnicalSpecifications. <T3>Public comments requested as to proposed no significant hazards consideration:</T3>No. The Commission's related evaluation of the amendment, consulationwith the State, and final determination of no significant hazards considerationare contained in a Safety Evaluation dated August 11, 1989. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>White Plains Public Library,100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York 10601 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Charles M.
