L. No. 91-508 (codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b,12 U.S.C. 1951 <T3>et seq., </T3>and 31 U.S.C. 5311-5324), authorizes the Secretary ofthe Treasury to require financial institutions to keep records and filereports that the Secretary determines have a high degree of usefulnessin criminal, tax, or regulatory matters. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 5313 andthe regulations thereunder, financial institutions are required to fileCurrency Transaction Reports with Treasury on transactions in currencyin excess of $10,000 ``by, through or to such financial institutions.''31 CFR 103.22(a).Two amendments were proposed to the Bank Secrecy Act regulations on June21, 1988 (53 FR 23289). The first amendment proposed would clarify whatis meant by the phrase in 31 CFR 103.27 that a financial institution shallverify the identification of ``any person or entity for whose or which<T3>account</T3>'' a transaction reportable under andSection; 103.22 is tobe effected. (Emphasis added). Two cases (<T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Murphy, </T3>809 F.2d 1427 (9th Cir. 1987) and <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Gimbel, </T3>632 F. Supp. 713 (E.D. Wis. 1984)), have held that theBank Secrecy Act regulations and the Currency Transaction Report do notrequire that the name of the person for whom the transaction is being carriedout be disclosed by the person conducting the transaction. Treasury's useof the term ``account'' in the phrase ``for whose or which account'' in31 CFR 103.27 was not meant to identify a customer account relationshipwith a financial institution, but always has been interpreted by Treasuryto be synonymous with ``on behalf of,'' as required by the Bank SecrecyAct itself, 31 U.S.C. 5313. Section 5313 states that ``a participant actingfor another person shall make the report as agent or bailee of the personand identify the person for whom the transaction is being made.'' Manycurrency transactions never involve any sort of customer bank account atall (<T3>e.g., </T3>purchasing money orders with cash).Although no other courts have adopted the holdings of <T3>Murphy </T3>and <T3>Gimbel, </T3>in order to clarify any lingering ambiguity in andSection;103.27, and to conform the regulation more closely to the statute, Treasuryproposed to change the phrase ``for whose or which account'' to ``on whosebehalf.'' This change makes clear that the financial institution must obtainthe identity of and other required information about the person for whomthe currency transaction was conducted. This was not intended to be, andindeed is not, a new requirement; financial institutions should have beenobtaining this information all along, and placing it in Part II of Form4789, the Currency Transaction Report (CTR).The second proposal dealt with the ``anti-structuring'' provision, 31 U.S.C.5324, added by the Money Laundering Control Act, Subtitle H of the Anti-DrugAbuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-570 (October 27, 1986). Section 5324 prohibitsany person from structuring or assisting in structuring, or attemptingto structure or assist in structuring, transactions ``for the purpose ofevading'' the currency transaction reporting requirements, and also prohibitsa person, for the same purpose, from causing or attempting to cause a financialinstitution to fail to file a CTR or to file a CTR that contains a materialomission or misstatement of fact. The enactment of section 5324 clarifiedthat all currency transaction structuring schemes designed to evade thereporting requirements are unlawful, regardless of whether the $10,000threshold is met at a single financial institution on a single day. <T3>See </T3>H.R. Rep. No. 746, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 18-20 (1986); S. Rep.No. 433, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 21-22 (1986).Since the structuring provision was enacted, there has been some concernby financial institutions that neither the statute itself nor the regulationgives a formal definition of ``structure'' or ``structuring,'' althoughthe only court to consider the question ruled that the absence of a definitionfor the term ``structuring'' does not render the statute unconstitutionallyvague. <T3>U.S. </T3>v. <T3>Scanio, </T3>No. CR 88-64T (W.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 1988.) Treasury hasreceived many inquiries since this provision was passed into law in 1986as to exactly what the term ``structuring'' means. In response to theserequests, Treasury proposed for inclusion in the Bank Secrecy Act regulationsa definition of ``structure'' or ``structuring,'' after consultation withthe Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice and the other BankSecrecy Act regulatory agencies. The proposed definition provided thata person structures a transaction if:<ITAG tagnum="15">(1) Acting alone, or in conjunction with, or on behalf of, other persons;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(2) He conducts, attempts to conduct or assists in conducting;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(3) One or more transactions in currency;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(4) In any amount;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(5) At one or more financial institutions;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(6) On one or more days;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(7) In any manner;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(8) For the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of 31 CFR103.22.</ITAG>The phrase ``in any manner'' is defined to include, but is not limitedto, all schemes involving the breaking down of sums of currency largerthan $10,000 into sums, including sums at or below $10,000, or throughthe conducting of a series of related currency transactions, includingtransactions at or below $10,000, at one financial institution or multiplefinancial institutions on one or more days. The definition also statesthat ``[t]he transaction or transactions need not exceed the $10,000 reportingthreshold at any single financial institution on any single day in orderto constitute structuring within the meaning of this definition.'' Thismakes it clear that structuring is not limited to multiple transactionsconducted on the same day at a single financial institution.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>Forty comments were received in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.Many of the comments were negative, but the issues the comments focusedon indicated a need for clarification of the responsibilities under theseamendments, rather than a need to change the proposals themselves.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Amendment to andSection; 103.27</ITAG>New ObligationsThere was much confusion on the part of the commenters on this particularproposal. On an initial note, many seemed to feel that a new obligationwas being proposed.In response to these comments, Treasury stresses at the outset that thisamendment does not impose a new obligation upon any financial institution;it merely clarifies the regulation to state more clearly the statutoryrequirement that ``a participant acting for another person shall make thereport as agent or bailee of the person and identify the person for whomthe transaction is being made.'' 31 U.S.C. 5313. Treasury always has intended,and consistently has stated, that the phrase ``of any person or entityfor whose or which account such transaction is to be effected'' refersto all transactions conducted by one person for another, <T3>i.e.</T3>, as an agent or bailee, not just those that are run throughaccounts. Many transactions conducted on behalf of others never involvean account at all. Part II of the CTR also clearly states that the financialinstitution must identify the individual or organization for whom a transactionis conducted. Therefore, this should not be seen as a new obligation forfinancial institutions, but a clarification of an existing one.Beneficial OwnerMany questioned the use of the term ``beneficial owner'' and whether thatmeant, for example, that transactions on behalf of corporations would needto have the stockholders of the corporation listed in Part II of the CTR.In Part II of the CTR, the financial institution identifies the individualor organization on whose behalf the transaction was conducted. The definitionof ``person'' for purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act regulations, 31 CFR103.11(l), should be consulted for guidance:<ITAG tagnum="20">An individual, a corporation, a partnership, a trust or estate, ajoint stock company, an association, a syndicate, joint venture, or otherunincorporated organization or group, and all entities cognizable as legalpersonalities.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Thus, if a currency transaction in excess of $10,000 is being conductedfor a corporation, only the information on the corporation itself is neededfor Part II of the CTR, and there is no need to determine the names ofthe stockholders in order to complete the CTR. In order to be consistentwith the regulations, the CTR is being revised to reference the term ``person.''The term ``beneficial owner'' was used in the Notice as merely anotherterm to designate the person on whose behalf the transaction was conducted.Knowledge RequirementMany commenters questioned how a financial institution was to gain knowledgeof whether a person is doing the transaction for someone else. Some commenterswondered if Treasury was imposing a positive duty to inquire of every customerif the transaction was being conducted on behalf of someone else.The Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to file complete andaccurate CTR's. Section 5313 clearly requires the financial institutionto ascertain the real party in interest where an agency relationship exists.Asking the customer clearly is one way of obtaining the information neededto complete the CTR. Treasury currently is considering future regulatoryand administrative action to require tellers to inquire of each of theircustomers for the information needed to complete the CTR, if that informationcannot otherwise be obtained from customer records. In the meantime, Treasuryrecommends that tellers ask their customers for the information they needto complete the CTR, if they do not already have that information in customerrecords, and to ask each customer for each transaction if he is conductingthe transaction on behalf of someone else, as that information is uniqueto each transaction and will not appear on a customer's signature cardor other records.In addition, as Treasury has consistently stated in the past, ``knowledge''clearly also includes the concept of ``willful blindness'' articulatedin the case of<T3> United States</T3> v.<T3> Jewell,</T3> 532 F.2d 697 (9th Cir.),<T3> cert. denied,</T3> 426 U.S. 951 (1976). This concept applies to aperson who has deliberately avoided positive knowledge. As the court statedin the<T3> Jewell</T3> case, ``if a person has his suspicions aroused but thendeliberately omits to make further inquiries because he wishes to remainin ignorance, he is deemed to have knowledge.'' Thus, if a financial institutionsuspects that someone may be either conducting currency transactions orhaving them conducted on his behalf, in amounts totaling more than $10,000,but deliberately refuses to ask questions because it wants to remain ignorant,and therefore ``innocent,'' the financial institution will be deemed tohave knowledge for purposes of assessing liability under the Bank SecrecyAct.Practicalities of ComplianceMany comments raised questions of the practicalities of complying withthe requirement. Some pointed out that this information could not be obtainedif the deposit was made by use of an automated teller machine or a nightdepository, or handled by a courier. Some commenters asked whether theycould rely on the information given to them by the person conducting thetransaction and/or the information in the file on the person on whose behalfthe transaction was being conducted. Several commenters inquired what theyshould do if a customer either refuses to give the needed information ordoes not have the information to give. Treasury notes that these questionsare not unique to this amendment and have been raised before with respectto the various requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act generally.In response to these comments, Treasury notes that a financial institutionmay rely on the information contained in its records if the customer conductingthe currency transaction does so on behalf of a person on whom the financialinstitution has records. Financial institutions also may rely on the informationgiven to them by someone conducting a currency transaction on behalf ofanother unless the financial institution has knowledge that the informationis incorrect. If the transaction is conducted by use of an automated tellermachine or a night depository, or by a courier and the information on theperson on whose behalf the transaction was conducted is fragmentary, thenthe CTR should be filled out as completely as possible, using the informationaccompanying the transaction and filling in what can be obtained from customerrecords at the financial institution. The CTR has a block to check to indicatethat the transaction was conducted through a night depository, automaticteller machine, or armored car service, all of which could account foran incomplete CTR.In transactions conducted by a courier, the information concerning thecourier is placed in Part I of the CTR, and the information on the personon whose behalf the transaction is being conducted (for example, a depositto a corporation's checking account) goes in Part II. If the courier isconducting currency transactions for more than one person, which eitherseparately or together aggregate to more than $10,000, then the informationconcerning the additional persons on whose behalf the transactions arebeing done is entered on the back of the CTR or on an addendum to the CTR.Several commenters raised the question of whether a financial institutionmust refuse a transaction if the person conducting the transaction cannotprovide needed information on the person on whose behalf the transactionis being conducted, and the financial institution does not have accountrecords on that person to supply the required information. The Bank SecrecyAct neither requires nor prohibits a financial institution to refuse acurrency transaction when the financial institution cannot obtain the informationnecessary to complete the CTR. However, under the Act and the regulations,financial institutions are responsible for filing complete and accurateCTR's. Section 103.26 of the regulations specifically requires that allinformation on the CTR be furnished. The Act and regulations further providefor both criminal and civil sanctions for willful violation of any provisionof the regulations. Thus, failure to obtain complete information couldresult in criminal and/or civil liability for financial institutions.ExamplesFinally, many commenters asked for examples of what the amendment means.While Treasury cannot compile an exhaustive list of the various ways thata person can conduct a transaction for another, listed below are severalsimple examples the illustrate various ways of performing transactionsfor others and the financial institution's corresponding Bank Secrecy Actresponsibilities. While for consistency purposes, all the financial institutionslisted in the examples are banks, these examples generally are applicableto other financial institutions.<ITAG tagnum="21">_Mary Jones walks into the bank, and deposits $15,000 into her personalchecking account. If she is conducting the transaction for herself, theamendment is not relevant, because Part II of the CTR does not need tobe completed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_John Stevens comes into the bank and deposits $18,000 into Mary Jones'savings account. Because this currency transaction may be on behalf ofanother person, Treasury recommends that the bank ask Mr. Stevens if heis conducting the transaction on behalf of another. If John Stevens isperforming the transaction on behalf of someone other than himself, theidentification information on him would be placed in Part I of the CTR(which asks for information concerning the person conducting the transactionwith the financial institution) and the information on the person on whosebehalf the transaction was conducted is placed in Part II of the CTR (whichasks for information concerning the person on whose behalf the transactionwas conducted).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Wiliam Evans comes into the bank and deposits $15,000, representingfees paid to a law firm partnership, of which he is a member, into thelaw firm partnership's operating account. The information on Mr. Evanswould go in Part I of the CTR, while the information on the law firm partnershipitself (a ``person'' under andSection; 103.11(1)) would go in Part II. Thebank does not list all the law firm partnership's partners in Part II.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Mr. Evans comes in the next day and deposits $25,000 into three ofthe law firm partnership's trust accounts on behalf of three of the lawfirm partnership's clients. The bank accounts are clearly labeled as trustaccounts. The financial institution should list the information on Mr.Evans in Part I of the CTR, and the information on each of the law firmpartnership's clients in Part II of the CTR, because the money is theirs,not the law firm partnership's. In addition, the new CTR form, which isexpected to be available in January 1989, will require the informationon the law firm partnership itself also to be listed in Part II, on theback of the CTR.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Angela Brown, the manager of Lee's Bakery, presents a check madepayable to cash and drawn on the bakery's account. Because the customerconducting the transaction is not the same as the name of the account holder,the bank should inquire of Ms. Brown if she is cashing the check on thebakery's behalf. If she is cashing the check on the bakery's behalf, theinformation on the bakery would be placed in Part II, and the informationon Ms. Brown would be placed in Part I.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Monica Roberts, a courier, comes into the bank and deposits $50,000into the Sunshine Corporation checking account. Treasury recommends thatthe bank ask the courier whether she is acting on behalf of Sunshine Corporation.The information on the courier goes in Part I. The information on the personon whose behalf the courier is making the deposit, whether obtained fromthe courier or the bank's records, goes in Part II. (A corporation is considereda person under andSection; 103.11(1). The bank would not list all of thecorporation's stockholders.)  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Jim Green comes into the bank with $25,000 in cash and purchasesa bank check with himself named as payee. In order to ensure an accurateCTR, Treasury recommends that the bank ask the customer for whom the transactionis being conducted. If Mr. Green is conducting the transaction for himself,the bank will not fill out Part II. If he is conducting it on behalf ofanother, the bank must complete Part II with the information on the personon whose behalf the transaction is being conducted.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Jim Green comes into the bank with $30,000 in currency and purchasesa bank check with Susan Smith listed as the payee. Because Mr. Green maybe performing this transaction for someone other than himself, Treasuryrecommends that the bank ask Mr. Green if he is conducting the transactionon behalf of another. If he is conducting the transaction on behalf ofanother, the information on Mr. Green is placed in Part I and the informationon the person on whose behalf the transaction is being conducted is placedin Part II.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Susan Smith comes into the bank and purchases bearer money orderswith $25,000 in cash. The bank has knowledge that she is a frequent customerand often carries large amounts of money to buy bearer money orders. Whenasked, she give her occupation as ``unemployed.'' Because this currencytransaction may be on behalf of another person, Treasury recommends thatthe bank ask Susan Smith if she is conducting the transaction on behalfof another.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Structuring Definition  </ITAG>Most of the comments on the proposed structuring definition centered aroundperceived additional duties on the part of financial institutions, andwhether Treasury could give additional guidance on the question of ``assisting''in structuring.  Additional Duties  Some financial institutions were concerned that this amendment would placeadditional responsibilities upon financial institutions to track currencytransactions that take place over more than one business day to ascertainwhether there has been structuring, just as they are currently requiredto aggregate currency transactions of which they are aware that take placeduring the same business day to determine whether the reporting thresholdunder andSection; 103.22 had been reached.  In response to these comments, Treasury notes that this amendment placesno new additional duties upon financial institutions; it merely codifiesthe existing interpretation of structuring. The amendment also imposesno additional recordkeeping or tracking responsibilities. There is no needto set up separate tracking systems to detect currency transactions thataggregate to more than $10,000 over more than one business day becausefinancial institutions are required to file CTR's only when a currencytransaction is conducted which exceeds $10,000 on one business day.  If the financial institution suspects, either because of the personal knowledgeof its employees or because of its computer or other recordkeeping system,that structuring is taking place, the financial institution should checkits records to ascertain whether currency transactions have taken placethat must be reported pursuant to 31 CFR 103.22(a), and should report itssuspicion that structuring has taken place to the local office of the InternalRevenue Service's Criminal Investigation Division. <T3>See</T3> BSA Administrative Ruling 88-1, June 22, 1988, published at53 FR 40062, 40064 (October 13, 1988).  Any information provided to the IRS should be given within the confinesof section 1103(c) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act. 12 U.S.C. 3401-3422.Section 1103(c) of that Act permits a financial institution to notify agovernment authority of certain information relevant to a possible violationof any statute or regulation. Such information may consist of the namesof any individuals or corporate entities involved in the suspicious transactions;account numbers; home and business addresses; social security numbers;type of account; interest paid on account; location of the branch or officewhere the suspicious transaction occurred; a specification of the offensethat the financial institution believes has been committed; and a descriptionof the activities giving rise to the bank's suspicion. S. Rep. 99-433,99th Cong., 2d Sess., 15-16.  Additionally, a financial institution many be required, by the Federalregulatory agency that supervises it, to submit a criminal referral form.Thus, a financial institution should check with its regulatory agency todetermine whether a referral form should be submitted.  Assisting in Structuring  Another point that some commenters raised, not directly related to thedefinition of ``structuring,'' was that some financial institutions wereconcerned that there were no guidelines to help the financial institutionin determining what ``assisting'' in structuring meant, and that they wouldbe subject to penalties if a financial institution merely explained thestructuring prohibition to its customers.  In response, Treasury emphasizes that the structuring activity must befor the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of andSection; 103.22.Thus, before a financial institution may be held liable, either criminallyor civilly, for assisting a customer in structuring transactions, the financialinstitution must have knowledge that its customer is attempting to circumventthe andSection; 103.22 reporting requirement and the financial institutionmust assist, that is, aid or help, the customer in that attempt. If a customerdisguises multiple cash transactions at a financial institution, withoutthe complicity of any officer or employee of the institution, and the financialinstitution after diligent use of its manual or automated aggregation systems(or any other means) has no knowledge that these transactions were by oron behalf of the same customer, the financial institution has not knowinglyand willfully violated the ``assisting in structuring'' provision of theBank Secrecy Act. However, if a financial institution suspects a customerof structuring, perhaps because of repeated transactions just under $10,000,but refuses to investigate further because it wants to remain in ignorance,the financial institution may be deemed to have knowledge of structuringby virtue of its ``willful blindness.'' <T3>See United States</T3> v. <T3>Jewell</T3>, 532 F.2d 697 (9th Cir.), <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 426 U.S. 951 (1976).  Although the term ``assist in structuring'' encompasses a wide range ofactions that no single definition can fully address, a distinction canbe drawn between merely explaining the requirements of this particularlaw, which is permissible, and advising the customer how to evade thoserequirements, which clearly would be a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act.For example, a bank employee, in response to a customer's questions, explainedthat all same business-day cash transactions in excess of $10,000 had tobe reported to the government, that any transaction of less than $10,000need not be reported, and that structuring of transactions to evade thereporting requirement is illegal. By merely explaining the law to the customer,the bank has not assisted the customer in structuring the transaction.Moreover, if the customer then decided to deposit only $9,000, the bankis not required to file a report under andSection; 103.22. A financial institutionis required to file a report only if a single currency transaction, oraggregated multiple currency transactions of which the financial institutionhas knowledge, exeeds $10,000 during a single business day. However, ifin that latter example, there were circumstances leading the financialinstitution to believe that the customer was structuring his transactionsto avoid the filing of a CTR, then it should report that fact to the localInternal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, along with theinformation, noted above, which is permissible to disclose under the Rightto Financial Privacy Act. <T3>See</T3> BSA Administrative Ruling 88-1, June 22, 1988.  Examples  Finally, some commenters asked for some examples of structuring. Whilethe following examples are by no means exhaustive, the following acts arecharacteristic of persons who are seeking to structure transactions toavoid the reporting requirements of andSection; 103.22: <ITAG tagnum="21">_The person, after being informed that the institution intends tofile a report on the transaction, seeks to take back part of the currencyin order to reduce the amount of the transaction to $10,000 or less.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_The person conducts multiple transactions  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Each involving less than $10,000, but totaling more than $10,00_overthe course of several consecutive or near-consecutive days (<T3>e.g.</T3>, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), whether at the same financialinstitution, different branches of the same institution, or different institutions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Two or more persons enter a financial institution together and separatelymake cash purchases of instruments such as cashier's checks that individuallydo not exceed $10,000, but that total more than $10,000, from differenttellers in the same institution.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_A customer makes a $9,000 deposit at 1:59 p.m. and a second depositof $9,000 at 2:01 p.m. when the bank's business day changes at 2 p.m. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_A customer comes into the bank on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday andThursday, and each time deposits $8,000 into his checking account.
