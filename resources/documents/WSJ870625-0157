With flattery and coyness, she persuades him to take her onto his boat. Once afloat, she plucks off her blonde wig, removes her chest enhancers and deploys a fishing rod. Beneath the disguise is country singer Mel Tillis. The purpose of his ruse: to spend some time fishing with William &quot;Bill&quot; Dance, known reverently in these waters as the &quot;Jack Nicklaus of fishing.&quot;    Mr. Tillis could have simply turned on his television set, where he would have encountered Mr. Dance, angling and gabbing, on a show that has made him the big fish in an unlikely, but fast-spawning, business: fishing television shows.    Currently, there are more than 50 television shows dedicated to the rod and reel. Viewership continues to mushroom, undaunted by the shows' low budgets, their unshucked corn -- the skit with Mr. Tillis opened one of Mr. Dance's shows -- and uncooperative fish of all stripes.    Not to mention the controversy that swirls around the programs. Some video fishermen have been accused of hiring scuba divers to swim beneath boats during filming to simulate nibbles.    That can of worms aside, television fishing is reeling in fame and fortune for a host of new video stars, no matter who considers it less than compelling viewing.    &quot;It's not Cecil B. De Mille,&quot; admits the amiable, 45-year-old Mr. Dance, a former furniture salesman and, since 1977, the de facto dean of American bass fishing. Mr. Dance, with his shiny, blue truck, his thick, Southern drawl, and an ever-present University of Tennessee baseball cap, doesn't look like a television magnate and certainly doesn't dine like one. (His favorite meal is fish marinated in hot sauce, dipped in corn meal and fried.) But he says he earns $500,000 a year, mostly from the businesses spawned by his television show, &quot;Bill Dance Outdoors&quot;: books, videos, personal appearances, a radio show and custom-designed lures, plus the fishing column he continues to write each week for his hometown newspaper.    There are 20 nationally televised fishing programs, with an additional 40 aired regionally, mostly in the South and the Midwest. And the number keeps growing. &quot;These days, every pro fisherman wants his own show,&quot; says Michael Jones, a marketing executive in Wilmington, Del.    The shows have lured advertising from such large corporations as Du Pont Co., Anheuser-Busch Inc. and General Motors Corp., and that doesn't include the products promoted by the hosts themselves, which are numerous. Indeed, some fishing hosts find more endorsable products in their outriggers than fish. Mr. Dance plugs sunglasses, fishing paraphernalia, chewing tobacco and beer. He insists that he tests each product before he endorses it.    Mr. Dance's weekly show, broadcast by both local television stations and by ESPN, the cable sports network, is probably the premier example of how a little bluegrass shtick, a lot of commercials and, weather permitting, some fishing capture the attention of 1.5 million families every week.    The Dance show opens with a country theme song and a corny skit. One recent episode featured former Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw swiping oranges from a grove in Florida. Chased by a gun-toting landowner, Mr. Bradshaw flees to a getaway truck driven by Mr. Dance. A narrator intones: &quot;Oh well, once a Steeler, always a stealer.&quot;    Mr. Dance and his guests fish and chat, interrupted every once in a while for brief piscatorial lectures on such topics as selecting the proper lures and testing water alkalinity. The lakes and streams are selected personally by Mr. Dance. Each show costs between $10,000 and $20,000 to produce and two days to film -- when Mother Nature cooperates, which she often does not.    And then there are the fish. On an outing in Mississippi with singer Bobby Goldsboro, the temperature topped 100 degrees and the fish turned finicky. After toiling all day to catch enough to complete the filming, the two men were still short one fish. Mr. Dance asked his guest to fill the empty air time by singing.    Some fishing purists groan over shows like Mr. Dance's. &quot;I'm not saying the hosts aren't good fishermen,&quot; says Ken Schultz, associate fishing editor of Field andamp; Stream. &quot;But many of the shows are more entertainment than anything else.&quot;    But audiences seem to like them, particularly shows with guest stars who don't know how to fish. On one of Mr. Dance's shows, former St. Louis Cardinals football coach Jim Hanifan, a first-time fisherman, hit Mr. Dance in the head with two lures, accidentally threw a pole into the lake and snagged a hook in the back of his own shirt. Mr. Dance's own pratfalls are also cherished by viewers. A few seasons ago, he fell into the water wrestling with a large catch. He hung on to his line -- and landed the fish.    &quot;I can't help but watch,&quot; says Tim Nitschke, the owner of a tackle store in Riverdale, Ga., &quot;because I learn about new techniques and lures. I also like some of his guests and watching their goofs.&quot;    Fishing shows run the gamut from slick, nationally syndicated productions to low-budget local shows that could have been filmed with a home movie camera. Some emphasize technical aspects of the sport while others focus on competitive fishing.    &quot;Lots of people can't stand Roland Martin {the host of 'Fishing with Roland Martin'} because he's always screaming and he overestimates {the weight of} his catches,&quot; says Mr. Nitschke.    Mr. Martin is not the only video fisherman accused of telling fish stories. Several trade writers contend that certain shows are heavy on misleading special effects.    Mr. Schultz of Field andamp; Stream says he has witnessed the host of one nationally televised fishing show catch a number of fish before the filming of the show. When the cameras roll, the fisherman pretends he is snaring them live.    It's hard to please everyone in the world of tele-fishing. Take Kenneth Goerg, an avid angler from Grand Rapids, Mich. He says he enjoys the screaming, exaggerating Mr. Martin because he is enthusiastic. However, he dislikes John Fox, the host of a cable fishing show, because of his insensitivity to the cause of conservation. &quot;He keeps everything he catches,&quot; complains Mr. Goerg.    Retorts Mr. Fox: &quot;I've thrown back 10-pounders and 12-pounders. My motto is, if you want some fish to eat, buy them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
