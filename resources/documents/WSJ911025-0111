Michael Frinquelli, insurance analyst with SalomonBrothers, says the Oakland fire could be the last wallop thatclears the way for an upturn in the property-casualtyindustry's boom-and-bust cycle, which normally lasts sixyears.</LP><TEXT>   Although other analysts say Mr. Frinquelli may be tooearly -- he has been recommending some stocks in the groupfor months -- they agree insurance stocks are cheap. Thegroup trades at an average of 1.3 times book value, thebenchmark most commonly used for property-casualty insurersbecause of their volatility. That compares with two timesbook value at their latest peak in 1986.   It isn't uncommon to hear predictions of a rise inproperty and casualty stocks after a disaster. In 1989 thestocks surged 5% after a series of cataclysms that includedHurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake. The theorywas that insurers' big catastrophe losses would put an end tofierce price competition and thus return the industry toprosperity; that upturn never materialized.   This week as the California fire blazed, money managersmade no such bet on a turnaround. The disaster in which 24people have died barely made a mark either way on insurancestocks, which fell slightly Tuesday but recovered some groundyesterday -- and Mr. Frinquelli says investors areoverlooking a good bet. &quot;The market overreacted&quot; to Hugo, hesays. &quot;And the market's doing the reverse this time, bypaying no attention to the fire.&quot;   After possible losses in the fourth quarter and the 1992first quarter, insurers' annual earnings will double or eventriple by 1993, he predicts. By then, he forecasts, insurancestocks will be trading at 1.5 times book value.   To be sure, Mr. Frinquelli is in a minority amonginsurance analysts, who generally say one such disasterdoesn't produce the kind of losses that can bring about anupturn. &quot;Give me five of these {disasters} back to back andI'll show you a turn in the cycle,&quot; says Chuck Ronson ofBaird Patrick.   Companies that have strong balance sheets will be in thebest position to take advantage of any turnaround when itcomes. As a result, Mr. Frinquelli this year has beenrecommending industry stalwarts such as Chubb, St. Paul Cos.and Safeco.   The fire itself isn't expected to result in heavy damageto insurers' earnings, many analysts say. Though estimates ofclaims against insurers related to the blaze range between$1.2 billion and $2 billion, some insurers will share thatburden with reinsurance companies. Safeco, for example, saidits claims from the fire totaled $40 million, but reinsurerswould pick up half of the tab.   Rather, Mr. Frinquelli says, the fire could be the finalcatalyst that forces a turnaround. The current downturnstarted in 1986 and is proving to be a particularly long one,compared with the typical threeyear declines of cycles past.   It has been prolonged by falling interest rates, whichhave allowed insurers to offset losses with gains on theirbond portfolios. Mr. Frinquelli says insurers may have playedout that hand, however, and already have realized the bulk ofthe gains from rising bond prices.   An economic recovery, if it has begun or is about to, alsocould cause damage claims to rise at insurance companies.&quot;When the economy picks up, people do more, they move around,and claims rise,&quot; Mr. Frinquelli says. That would requireinsurers to add to their weakened reserves for claimspayouts, he says, and the need for fatter reserves shouldimpel insurers to boost prices, eventually helping earnings.   Even more important, insurance regulators are draftingrules that would set capital guidelines based on theriskiness of an insurer's assets and liabilities. Many saythe new guidelines for so-called risk-based capital willforce many property-casualty and life insurance companies toraise capital, strengthening their balance sheets -- andthat, too, would hasten a turnaround. &quot;This is an industrythat is in trouble because of its balance sheet,&quot; Mr.Frinquelli says.</TEXT></DOC>
