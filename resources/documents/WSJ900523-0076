The ruling, by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Felsenthal,holds that First RepublicBank appeared to transferapproximately $130.7 million in assets, through intra-companydividends and other means, from certain subsidiary banks at atime when their financial condition was deterioratingrapidly.</LP><TEXT>   The immediate effect of the ruling was to increasesignificantly the FDIC's voice in the pending vote on thecompany's plan to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings. TheFDIC earlier won the right to vote $51 million in claimsagainst the debtor. That vote will be increased by the $130.7million in claims allowed by Judge Felsenthal.   The FDIC had asked that it be allowed to vote a total ofapproximately $274 million in claims stemming from FirstRepublicBank's alleged diversion of assets from the banks.The judge allowed claims involving the payment of dividendsand the modification of certain contracts between the holdingcompany and the banks, but disallowed others, including theclaim that the holding company paid too little when it boughtthe credit-card operations of its member banks.   The decision was made only for the purposes of determiningthe FDIC's voting power and isn't binding on future disputesbetween the agency and other parties to the bankruptcy-lawcase.   Lawyers for the FDIC said the ruling plowed new legalground because the judge held that First RepublicBank had a&quot;heightened fiduciary duty&quot; to preserve the value of thebanking units for the benefit of the banks' creditors anddepositors. First RepublicBank had argued that its fiduciaryduty was to shareholders and creditors of the holdingcompany.   &quot;His rulings on the law were brave,&quot; said Jeffrey W. Hurt,a lawyer for the FDIC who said previous case law stems frombank failures in the 1890s and 1930s. &quot;It's the clearestdelineation of the fiduciary duty of an owner to a subsidiary{bank} that I've found,&quot; he added.   But attorneys for creditors and the company downplayed thesignificance. &quot;I think that's wishful thinking on the FDIC'spart,&quot; said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer for certaincreditors. He said the company hasn't yet presented all thefacts in the case. &quot;When the issue is fully litigated, Ithink the FDIC will lose both factually and legally,&quot; headded.   Hugh Ray, an attorney for the senior unsecured creditors,said the creditors can take comfort in the judge's languagebecause he disallowed more of the FDIC's claims than heallowed. &quot;Basically, he {the judge} said there's no duty torun a holding company for the benefit of the FDIC, and alsothat {a holding company} can't strip banks of assets,&quot; hesaid.   In a separate proceeding in U.S. district court here, theFDIC is seeking to be allowed to vote an additional $1billion in claims stemming from a loan the agency made toFirst RepublicBank's Dallas and Houston banks before theyfailed.   Apart from the FDIC claims, First RepublicBank and asubsidiary, IFRB Corp., list senior unsecured claims totaling$673.3 million. Creditors' attorneys said they believe thecompany's reorganization plan will pass despite FDICopposition because all creditors committees have now approvedit. The plan would allow the company to emerge from Chapter11 protection before paying any of the claims made by theFDIC by setting up a fund to pay the agency after variouslawsuits are settled. Eventually, the plan calls for thecompany to liquidate itself.   First RepublicBank -- which isn't related to FirstRepublic Bancorp. Inc. of San Francisco -- and IFRB listassets, apart from claims that are contingent on the outcomeof litigation, totaling $384 million.</TEXT></DOC>
