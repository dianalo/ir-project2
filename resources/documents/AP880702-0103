A Justice Department spokesman responded by saying congressionalcritics should ``put their money where their mouths are.''Spokesman Patrick Korten said the Government Accounting Officereport itself was ``lackadaisical.''   The report by the GAO, the congressional watchdog agency, saidthat the Justice Department doesn't know the status of many of itsPentagon fraud investigations because it does a poor job of keepingtrack of what its far-flung offices are doing.   The GAO said that Attorney General Edwin Meese III should ordera number of administrative changes to do a better job of overseeinginvestigations of the Defense Department.   The study did not include any review of the current fraud andbribery investigation of Pentagon weapons buying that became publicwhen search warrants were served June 14. The probe focuses onallegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of whomare former military men, bribed Pentagon officials for contractingdetails that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions ofdollars. No one has yet been charged.   The GAO report was released by Sens. William Proxmire, D-Wis.,and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.   In a joint statement, they said, ``one of the most shockingaspects of the (defense fraud) problem is that the law enforcementsystem is incapable of adequately dealing with it.''   ``The Justice Department's lackadaisical, careless, hands-offmanagement goes far to explain why the government is losing the waragainst defense fraud,'' they said.   ``If any major private law firm handled its affairs the wayJustice handles the defense fraud program, it would be out ofbusiness within a year,'' they said.   The GAO proposed a number of administrative steps to correct theproblem, including development of some type of recording andtracking system and written management plans for effective us ofstaff time.   Korten suggested that if Grassley and Proxmire want the JusticeDepartment to gather statistics, they should push for more moneywhen its budget comes up for consideration. ``In short, put theirmoney where their mouths are,'' he said.   ``It just doesn't add up. The fact of the matter is that we areanything but lackadaisical in our prosecution of these cases, andthe current big case involving the Pentagon is a prime example. Wehave had literally dozens of procurement fraud cases in recentyears. We have recovered tens of millions of dollars for thetaxpayers in these cases, and what they (GAO) choose to look atinstead is how much information we have in our computer inWashington,'' Korten said.   ``It seems to me to be an awfully _ just to use a phrase _lackadaisical way of taking a look at how cases are prosecuted,''he said.   Korten said a staff turnover problem cited in the report is partof larger pay scale problem in the federal government because oflow government salaries.   Victoria Toensing, deputy assistant attorney general in thecriminal division, said U.S. attorney offices around the countrydon't have enough staff to both prosecute and gather statistics.   The GAO study reviewed 680 fraud allegations, involving chargesof bribery, corruption, conflict of interests, and antitrustviolations. They ranged from October 1983 through May 1987 and wereall cases that were referred to local U.S. attorneys for action.   As of last September, the GAO said, no action had been taken on286 of the referrals.   ``The majority of the 286 pending referrals had been with theJustice components for a year or more, and Justice does not knowwhether these cases have been accepted, declined or are stillpending,'' the GAO said.   The Justice Department didn't even know how many attorneys wereassigned to Pentagon fraud cases around the nation, the GAO said.   The report said officials in most of the U.S. Attorney officesagreed that there was a problem, and it was attributed to highrates of turnover among both the lawyers and the clerical staff.   The problem is the same in the Defense Procurement Fraud Unit, aspecial Justice Department office set up to prosecute Pentagoncases. That office has had a high rate of turnovers because itslawyers can get higher salaries in private practice, the GAO noted.Thus, the unit has a difficult time keeping experienced attorneys.</TEXT></DOC>
