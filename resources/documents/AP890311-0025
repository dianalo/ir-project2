Janusz Onyszkiewicz, spokesman for the outlawed movement, alsosaid the union will support candidates in the June voting and wantsSolidarity candidates to be able to present themselves publically asSolidarity members.   ``If these elections are supposed to be at least partlydemocratic, we must have a chance to fight in them. And that is whyour access to the mass media during the ... campaigns is soimportant,'' Onyszkiewicz said.   An agreement between the government and the opposition willcreate a new national legislature _ a senate _ that will act as theupper chamber of Parliament. The current legislature, the Sejm,would be the lower chamber.   Opposition candidates will be allowed to take part in what may bethe first national democratic elections in the communist block. Inaddition, 35 percent of the seats in the existing Sejm will be setaside for contested elections.   However, a new office of president with broad powers also will becreated, and that likely will remain in the hands of the rulingcommunists.   Nevertheless, the agreement is so far the most significantdevelopment during the six weeks of talks between the opposition andgovernment on ways to solve Poland's crushing economic and socialproblems.   The discussions also have resulted in agreements in principle tolegalize Solidarity and other independent groups outlawed after amartial-law crackdown in December 1981.   It had been uncertain if the oppositon, which has no legallyfunctioning political party and no legal newspapers or broadcastmedia, would be able to get its message to the voters.   Solidarity activist Adam Michnik, speaking after a meeting ofnegotiators Friday, said authorities promised that opposition groupswill be able to use state television, radio and newspapers.   ``The government coalition side declared that the opposition, orlet's call it the social side, will have access to the mass mediafor the period of the election campaign,'' he said. ``But we don'ttreat it as access to the mass media in general. ... This is stillthe subject of deep conflict.''   The opposition is seeking some program time on state televisionand radio to use as it chooses. Communist Party negotiators opposethat, saying it would undermine the internal integrity of thestate-run broadcast media.   Authorities have agreed that the opposition will be allowed topublish its own newspapers.   The powers of the new Senate have not been established, butnegotiators said it would exercise some sort of veto control overacts passed by the Sejm.   Opposition negotiators have agreed to a guarantee that theCommunist Party and its allies would control 65 percent of theSejm's 460 seats, but for the first time opposition candidates whogather 3,000 nominating signatures will be able to run for the otherseats.</TEXT></DOC>
