<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-0847 </DOCNO><TEXT>A series of experiments has been performed with pulsed electric dischargesin low-pressure nitrogen in order to elucidate excitation processes whichunderlie auroral photon emission. Flowing nitrogen in a large-volumeglass container at 30 to 3000 mtorr is excited by 4 {mu}s pulses which,typically, are at 12000 V and 900 A. The radiation issuing from the dischargetube is analyzed by means of time-resolved spectroscopy with particularattention given to the nitrogen first positive system, B{sup 3}Pi/subg/{yields}A{sup 3}{Sigma}{sup +}/sub u/. Dramatic changes have been notedin the relative band intensities of the 1PG spectra subject to the influenceof the variation of the experimental conditions. In particular, the distributionof population among vibrational levels of the B{sup 3}Pi/sub g/ stateevolves in time both during and after the exciting electric pulse, withthe trends strongly correlated with the numbers of collisions. Further,radiation from these excited vibrational levels continues at much higheremission rates than those commensurate with ther radiative lifetimes.Both of these observations constitute evidence of the intersystem collisionaltransfer of excitation. The distinguishing feature of this array of experimentsis the application of time-resolved spectroscopy which permits examinationof the development of level populations on a collision-by-collision basis.copyright American Geophysical Union 1988</TEXT></DOC>
