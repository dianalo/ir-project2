Look for a card that supportsresolutions of 640 by 480, 800 by 600, and 1,024 by 768 pixels.andP;  Some boardsalso support resolutions of 1,280 by 1,024 and higher, but don't pay extrafor these resolutions unless your applications and monitor support them.andM;2.andP;  HOW MANY cOLORS CAN THE CARD DISPLAY? The four different levels of colorsupport for Super VGA cords are expressed in bits per pixel.andP;  A 4-bit carddisplays up to 16 colors simultaneously, while an 81it card displays up to256 colors.andP;  With 15- or 16-bit chigh color) cards, you con see up to 32,768or 65,536  colars simultaneously, while 24-bit (true color) cards displayphoto-quality images in up to 16.7 million colors.andM;3.andP;  WILL MY SOFTWARE WORK WITH THE CARD?
