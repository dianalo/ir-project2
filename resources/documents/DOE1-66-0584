The resulting wave equation for the scalar field phi(t, x) is reducedto a second-order differential equation for T/sub kl/(t) (the time-dependentpart of phi(t, x)) which is approximately solved not only in the neighborhoodof x ident to t/a({Lambda}a/sup 2/ ident to 3) {similar_to} 0, but alsoin the neighborhood of x ident to t/a -andgt; {infinity}. Such a work willbe useful for dealing with its quantized version in connection with thepair-creation of those particles.</TEXT></DOC>
