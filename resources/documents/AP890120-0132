PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Andrei D. Sakharov, rejected as a parliamentarycandidate by the Academy of Sciences, on Friday presented a platformcalling for military cuts and more democracy to colleagues who inprotest nominated him for another seat.   ``I am far from enthusiastic about much of what has happened inour country in the past year,'' Sakharov softly told co-workers atthe Lebedev Institute of Physics, citing new limitations oncooperatives, meetings and demonstations, and the governmentreaction to the Armenia-Azerbaijan dispute.   The 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and dean of the Soviethuman rights movement spoke at the institute from which he wasbanished for almost seven years for his criticism of the Sovietintervention in Afghanistan.   Sakharov's bumpy candidacy for the Congress of People's Deputies,the new parliamentary body President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says is acrucial element of reform, illustrated the bugs remaining in thecumbersome electoral system approved in December, as well as theresistance facing many of the staunchest backers of reform.   Sakharov, appearing tired and resting his chin on a hand thatclutched his glasses, listened quietly as hundreds of his colleaguesunanimously demanded that the decision by the academy leadership bedeclared invalid, and nominated him for a seat in the congress fromthe Oktyabr region of Moscow, where the institute is located.   Institute workers already had approved Sakharov's candidacy by avote of 1,543-22, but crowded into the conference hall to hear a20-minute outline of his views on foreign affairs, ethnic policy,the economy and human rights. Sakharov then answered writtenquestions sent to the podium.   Sakharov, who in September called for a 50 percent cut in theamount of time Soviets must spend in military service, departed fromhis two pages of text to term Gorbachev's announcement Wednesdaythat the number of military personnel will be cut by 12 percent``extraordinarily important.''   ``But I think more radical cuts are necessary,'' he added. ``Theyare fully possible in the present international circumstances.''   But he criticized the Kremlin's policy on the ethnic disturbancesin Armenia and Azerbaijan, called a new law on meetings anddemonstrations ``an anti-perestroika law,'' and a directive by theCouncil of Ministers in December ordering cooperatives out of somelucrative businesses as ``a step backward.''   He said it was ``senseless'' to insist that the Nagorno-Karabakh,the source of the bloodletting between Armenia and Azerbaijan,remain part of Azerbaijan. ``This is completely unacceptable for theentire Armenian population,'' he said.   He renewed his demands for release of all political prisoners andlaws guaranteeing complete freedom of association.   If elected, Sakharov pledged to pursue his views with all hisstrength.   Sakharov helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the 1950s,but turned to human rights activities in the 1960s and 1970s. He wasbanished in January 1980 to the closed city of Gorky for hiscriticism of the drive into Afghanistan and remained there untilGorbachev allowed him to return to Moscow in December 1986.   Since then he generally has supported Gorbachev, but occasionallycriticizes some aspects of the Soviet leader's policies.   The Academy of Sciences has the right to elect 25 members of thenew congress, which will be made up of 2,250 people. A third will beelected from social, political or trade union organizations,including the Academy. The remaining two-thirds will be selected onthe basis of balloting in geographic districts.   A meeting of Academy of Sciences leaders on Wednesday chose 23candidates to present to the entire membership as candidates fromamong more than 130 members who were nominated. Two more were chosenThursday by affiliates of the academy.   Sakharov was nominated by more than 50 institutes of the academy,but was not among the final 23. Other losers were such reformers asspace scientist Roald Sagdeev, nominated by 25 institutes, andeconomists Gavril Popov, nominated by 16, and Nikolai Shmelev,nominated by 11.   The newspaper Izvestia said that among the others not chosen wereeconomist Abel Aganbegyan, and Dmitri Likhachev, the dean of Soviethistorians.   Now nominated as a candidate from a geographical district,Sakharov's candidacy must pass through at least one local electoralcommission before it can be presented to voters March 26. Supporterssaid several other institutes would also nominate Sakharov from thesame district to strengthen the possibility his name will be on thefinal ballot.   The unanimous resolution from the Lebedev institute complainedthat the leadership of the Academy of Sciences excluded anyrepresentatives of scientific workers from taking part in theirdeliberations, and that all those nominated were top-ranking figuresin the academy.   It said none of them were nominated by as many institutes asSakharov, Sagdeev, Popov or Shmelev. It said the academy's decisionwas invalid because those chosen did not receive an absolutemajority of votes from the 370 members of the selection committee.Only about 190 members actually attended the session and voted, itsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
