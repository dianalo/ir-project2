As a result, many a ballot was cast in Sunday's parliamentaryelections after furtive glances at neighbors or the outrightcomparing of notes.   A young couple standing side-by-side at desks separated only bylow partitions in one suburban polling center discussed the meritsof each candidate in their district before agreeing on a mutuallyacceptable member of the opposition Socialist Party.   An elderly woman nearby filled in a ballot for her husband, whowas cradling their grandson.   Voters outside gathered for one final look at photographs of thecandidates on campaign posters, which had to conform to governmentsize regulations to be pasted on the center's official billboard.   One housewife said she went to the center undecided but chose aLiberal Democrat after examining his poster.   ``He looked the most respectable of the bunch,'' she said.   The election for the 512 seats in the powerful lower house ofJapan's bicameral Parliament was seen as a crucial test of whetherscandals and unpopular policies would end the Liberal Democrats'more than three decades of control over the government.   More than 90 million people age 20 or older were eligible tovote, and officials said about 73 percent cast ballots. Thoseunable to pencil in their vote on the light green ballots becauseof physical disability, illiteracy or other reason were able todesignate proxies to vote for them.   The counting of the votes began immediately after most centersclosed at 6 p.m., and the first ``assured winner'' based oncomputer projections was declared just 90 minutes later on publiclysupported television.   But difficulties were expected in counting the handwrittenvotes, which could be nullified for misspellings or unnecessarymarkings. And because voters have been known to write only thefamily name of their chosen candidate, problems also were expectedin one district where three Satos were in the running and inanother that had three Kogas.   In a separate ballot Sunday, a national referendum was held onthe performance of eight of Japan's 15 Supreme Court judges. Theeight took their seats after the last such poll, during electionsfor both houses of Parliament in 1986.   Spaces were provided for voters to mark if they thought any ofthe Cabinet-appointed justices should be removed.   The system was written into the constitution by U.S.-ledoccupation forces after World War II to provide a safeguard againstunpopular appointees, but it has been criticized as ineffective.   No justice has resigned because of a poor rating, and criticssay many voters do not know the backgrounds of the judges they arerating well enough to render a fair decision.   That charge was reflected by the young wife at the suburbanpolling center, who held out her ballot to her husband and asked:``Do you know any of these people?''</TEXT></DOC>
