The options strategy -- in which traders borrowed heavily from brokers to sell certain options on a bet that the stock market would remain flat or go up -- fell apart as the market plunged 508 points on Oct. 19. Brokers across the country scrambled to sell traders' positions to try to recover their losses, the officials said.    The industry officials said the widespread losses are likely to curtail options-trading strategies that have been marketed over the past few years to investors as nearly risk-free ways to profit from a bull market.    &quot;A lot of people for the last two years felt that they had their own printing press making money for them by writing naked puts (options). Then the avalanche hit&quot; Oct. 19, said Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Corp., a New York investment firm.    Leveraged option trades gone awry allegedly cost one Florida customer of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. and the partnerships he controls $50 million after the crash, and put an options market-making firm on the American Stock Exchange out of business with losses of nearly $30 million, according to Wall Street officials familiar with both situations. William D. Mayer, founder of the Amex trading firm that bore his name, declined to comment on the reported losses.    Similar options-trading strategies contributed to the nearly $90 million charge taken by Continental Illinois Corp. for losses sustained by the Chicago bank holding company's First Options of Chicago Corp. trading unit after the crash, industry officials said. A Continental Illinois spokesman wouldn't elaborate further on the First Options losses. And Charles Schwab Corp. officials confirmed that options trades by a single customer accounted for $15 million of a $22 million after-tax charge disclosed last Thursday by the San Francisco brokerage firm.    Industry officials said that much of the losses from options trading Oct. 19 involved trading in options on the Standard andamp; Poor's 100-stock index, which are traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The Sandamp;P 100 index option is the most actively traded options contract in the country.    In this particular options strategy, traders sold &quot;out of the money&quot; put options that weren't offset by stock holdings, or, in investment parlance, were &quot;naked.&quot; A put option gives its holder the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying stock, or value of a stock index, at a set price before a certain date. An out-of-the-money option is priced below market levels at the time it's bought or sold.    In a bull market, sellers receive premium income for these options, which expire worthless, as long as the market remains stable or advances. As the market collapsed Oct. 19, the option holders exercised their right to sell stocks back to the option sellers at prearranged prices that were already above the market price of the plunging stock.    &quot;Retail brokers were telling clients to write puts because it's free money,&quot; Mr. Gordon said, declining to cite a specific brokerage firm.    &quot;Schwab isn't the end&quot; of the brokerage firms that will be taking options trading losses, Mr. Gordon added.    To date, losses from options trading haven't seriously threatened any of the major securities firms.    Some brokerage firms already have begun clamping down on naked options trading by customers. A Bear Stearns official who asked not to be identified confirmed that the company prohibited customers from writing naked put options after the Oct. 19 crash because of extreme market volatility. (The Bear Stearns official declined to comment on the alleged $50 million customer loss, which was disclosed in a federal court lawsuit filed last week.)    As previously reported, Boston-based Fidelity Investments said its discount brokerage units, Fidelity Brokerage Services Inc. and National Financial Services Corp., stopped taking individual investors' orders for new positions in naked options as of last Thursday.    Losses from this type of options trading snowballed faster than actual stock market losses on Oct. 19 because of the relatively small amount of equity underlying many traders' options holdings, said Jeffrey Miller, managing partner of Miller, Tabak, Hirsch andamp; Co., a New York firm specializing in options trades.    Some professional options traders not only trade on relatively thin margins; they are allowed to borrow from their brokers to meet regulatory capital requirements, he noted. These brokers process and guarantee the traders' accounts against default.    Once the market began collapsing Oct. 19, &quot;you could have had traders holding $100 million in stock on only $3 million to $4 million at their clearing firm&quot; as a deposit with which to pay for the securities, Mr. Miller said. Clearing firms in such a situation were forced to sell the traders' stocks as the market continued to fall in an attempt to recoup as much of the losses as possible, he said.    &quot;Anybody who writes a put option has to assume he's long on the stock&quot; because of the possibility that the option will be exercised and the writer will be left owning the securities, said Gary Lahey, an options trader and vice chairman of the Chicago Board Options Exchange.    &quot;That means they made the same misjudgment the rest of the world did&quot; on Oct. 19, when the stock market crashed, he said.    Separately, the CBOE continues to investigate whether customers lost money on the options exchange Oct. 20, the morning after the crash, as a result of poor pricing by CBOE market makers in options on the Standard andamp; Poor's 100 stock index, said Alger Chapman, CBOE chairman.    &quot;I'd be surprised if they don't have the results of the analysis within three weeks,&quot; said Mr. Chapman. </TEXT></DOC>
