The same proportion has raised its foreign language requirementover the past five years.   Foreign language requirements in other countries areconsiderably heavier. It takes seven years of English to graduatefrom an Israeli high school, for example.   A study by Charles J. Andersen Jr., senior research associatefor the council, found that about one in eight of the colleges, 13percent, requires some foreign language study of all applicants.One in 12 increased its requirement between 1982 and 1987.   There was much less interest in languages among two-yearcommunity colleges, which are more oriented toward getting jobs fortheir graduates. Only 1 percent required any foreign language studyas a condition of entrance and only about 13 percent required anyfurther instruction for the associate degrees they usually grant.   The survey was based on replies from nearly 400 of more than3,200 institutions listed by the U.S. Department of Education.   Richard Brod, who does similar studies for the Modern LanguageAssociation, said in a telephone interview that requirements havebeen increasing since the late 1970s or early 1980s. He said thetrend is based on a recognition of a need for competitivenessagainst rivalry from other countries.   Language requirements here were much heavier before World WarII, when a smaller proportion of high school graduates went on tocollege.   ``There was a loosening in the 1950s and 1960s,'' Brod said.``Then there was a revival _ based partly on the Soviets sending upthe first Sputnik (space satellite).''   Brod found language study reaching a peak in 1965-66, and thendeclining again. ``Now enrollments in foreign language classes areincreasing, at a time when enrollments in general are only holdingsteady,'' he said.   The council study also found:   _77 percent of all four-year colleges require students to takeat least one internationally-oriented course, such as Westernhistory or world civilization.   _63 percent of the colleges had programs permitting study inother countries.   _85 percent reported at least some foreign publications in theirlibraries; among two-year colleges, 32 percent said they had noneat all.   _Nearly half the four-year colleges increased the number offoreign students in the past five years. More than half increasedthe number of international courses, hired new faculty withknowledge of international affairs and increased the size of theinternational collections in their libraries.</TEXT></DOC>
