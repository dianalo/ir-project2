Now Congress's drive for new banking legislation has failed again, so the peeling back will resume.    The winners are banks, which are expected to extend the string of victories that they've had before friendly federal regulators, state governments and the courts.    The losers are securities, insurance and real estate firms, which need congressional action to stem banks' incursions onto their turf, and Congress, which is losing control of the subject.    Bankers think the tide is flowing in favor of broader bank powers. &quot;The marketplace is moving so rapidly that this year's banking bill may appear to be old hat next year,&quot; said Edward Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association.    The Federal Reserve Board is expected to move quickly to let banks underwrite corporate debt, probably before a new Congress is sworn in next January. More gradually, the states are expected to expand banks' authority to sell insurance and deal in real estate.    House leaders are frustrated. Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) was said to be &quot;livid&quot; recently about a letter from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urging action on the banking bill. Some lawmakers viewed the letter as Mr. Greenspan's way of serving notice that if the Congress doesn't act, he will.    &quot;It's nice to know of your interest in our legislation,&quot; the speaker responded sarcastically. As banking legislation died for the 100th Congress, he wrote to Mr. Greenspan saying that bank regulation &quot;is rightfully a legislative concern,&quot; and that &quot;we will take care of this matter in the legislative process.&quot;    Speaker Wright &quot;made it very clear that he expects them (the Fed governors) to wait&quot; before approving new powers for banks, said Rep. Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.), chairman of the House Banking Committee.    &quot;We don't want them to go hog wild,&quot; Mr. St Germain thundered in an interview. If they do, he threatened, Congress will roll back their rules legislatively.    In the last days of the 100th Congress, some lawmakers wanted to rush through a resolution barring further loosening of bank regulation by federal agencies. But bank supporters quashed the effort, and the House leaders' words are unlikely to stop the Fed from approving corporate debt underwriting for banks, bank attorneys say.    The Fed already has withheld action for more than a year to give Congress a chance to legislate on this issue. Fed members and staffers say they have an obligation to respond to pending applications. Moreover, a bill approved by the House Banking Committee and one approved by the Senate 94-2 would have let banks underwrite corporate debt. And retiring Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.), who is retiring after this session, urged the Fed to continue granting banks additional securities powers. So it would be hard to argue that action by the Fed would defy congressional wishes.    Legal impediments are few. The federal appeals court in New York has suggested that banks could be cleared to engage in limited underwriting of almost any securities, not just the four currently allowed.    Beyond limited corporate debt dealing, most banking lawyers say that the Fed will move slowly for fear of triggering a congressional backlash.    Currently, the Fed allows a bank affiliate to underwrite mortgage-backed securities, municipal revenue bonds, commercial paper and securities backed by various debts, as long as they don't produce more than 5% of the affiliate's gross revenue. That slips under the legal bar against banks' affiliating with firms &quot;principally engaged&quot; in securities trading.    Fed officials have served notice that they may raise the ceiling to 10%, but not before next summer, after banks will have built up a year's experience with the original four powers.    It's unclear whether the Fed will authorize banks to underwrite mutual fund shares. Chase Manhattan Corp.'s president, Thomas Labreque, has said his company will seek clearance to underwrite mutual funds as well as debt securities. But some bank lawyers agree with David Silver, a lobbyist for the Investment Company Institute, who says that past Fed positions make it hard for banks to squeeze open-ended mutual funds through the &quot;principally engaged&quot; loophole. The institute is a trade group for mutual funds.    The Fed is clearly receptive to allowing stock underwriting. The courts haven't questioned its authority to do that, and Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson has said the Fed governors &quot;would more or less look favorably&quot; on equities underwriting applications if Congress failed to act. But Fed governors are expected to delay the move in deference to Congress, most lawyers say. &quot;Congress will be mightily upset if the Fed tries to do that by itself,&quot; warned Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.).    As for legislation, Rep. St Germain predicted that he would have a comprehensive bank bill &quot;on the way to the Senate before the snows melt next year.&quot;    Skeptics abound. &quot;I don't believe anybody gets anything early in any new Congress,&quot; said Karen Shaw, a Washington, D.C., bank consultant.    In fact, legislation next year may be slowed by a transition to a new banking Senate panel and efforts to deal with broader banking issues. Some lawmakers even are talking about revising the deposit insurance system in a catch-all bill that also restructures the banking industry.    The tide in Congress could turn against banks. Some bankers fear, for instance, that the growing focus on insolvent thrifts' losses could spark a drive to tighten controls on all financial institutions. And lobbying pressure will remain for costly or burdensome consumer-service requirements and curbs on insurance sales.    But most banks still expect Congress will eventually give them relatively unfettered securities powers, in part because they can't get all they need from regulators. For years, banks have been losing their best clients to the securities markets. And current restrictions leave securities underwriting awkward for the biggest banks, and useless for the rest.    In any event, quick congressional action on bank powers is doubtful in light of the extraordinary crossfire that it must survive from competing interests. Legislating on the subject &quot;is like Lebanon,&quot; said one securities lobbyist, &quot;there are factions within factions.&quot;    Finally, some predict states will take the lead in expanding bank powers. Already, 22 states give their banks more freedom than federally chartered banks have to engage in insurance and real estate. California has a ballot referendum this fall on letting banks sell insurance. Delaware currently allows some securities underwriting by state-chartered banks, Ms. Shaw notes, and New York has debated a similar move.    Big banks have been slow to take advantage of permissiveness by states, says Ms. Shaw. But if states keep loosening the reins, she says, &quot;somebody will take advantage of that and that will trigger a whole stampede.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
