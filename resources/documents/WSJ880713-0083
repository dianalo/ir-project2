But the results and earlier reports from other chip concerns also suggest that among companies basking in new-found wealth, some are wealthier than others. Indeed, at least for the near term, semiconductor manufacturing is becoming a two-tiered industry in which the top performers are distinguished by either their proprietary products or their ability to exploit once dowdy commodities like DRAM, or dynamic random-access memory, chips. At the same time, the top companies also are showing an ability to seize opportunities in desktop computing.    Among the wealthier of the wealthy is Intel. Its orders, for instance, are outstripping shipments at a much faster rate than at Advanced Micro Devices Inc., whose stock fell Monday despite a strong earnings increase.    Yesterday, Intel reported that second-quarter profit surged to $130.7 million, or 73 cents a share, on a 66% rise in revenue to $726.7 million. Year-earlier profit was $46.5 million, or 25 cents a share, on revenue of $439 million. For the first half, Intel more than tripled its profit to $224.4 million, or $1.27 a share, from $72 million, or 39 cents a share. Revenue rose 63% to $1.36 billion from $833.5 million a year earlier.    &quot;It feels good,&quot; said Andrew S. Grove, president and chief executive officer. &quot;A year and a half ago we were perceived to be on our deathbed.&quot; Finally, he said, the company is seeing the payoff from its commitment to supplying its proprietary microprocessors to power the desktop computing revolution. That commitment was a liability in 1985-86 when desktops were languishing, but now the rising tide of desktop demand is lifting microchip suppliers as well. He added that the improved performance extends across all the company's product lines, from chips to systems.    Analysts were ecstatic. &quot;Superb,&quot; said Adam Cuhney, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;Better than the Street's expectations and better than analysts' expectations.&quot; Intel shares rose in heavy national over-the-counter trading to close yesterday at $35.75, up $1.125.    Though chips are generally healthy now, Kidder's Mr. Cuhney says, &quot;A select few companies are truly benefiting from the state of the technology.&quot;    Intel is leading the pack due to its edge in microprocessors, or computers on a chip, with Motorola Inc. sharing the wealth to some degree. In static RAM, or random-access memory, he says, Integrated Device Technology Inc. looks good. In DRAMS, Texas Instruments Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. are raking in orders by supplying scarce 256K and one-megabit memory chips, whose spot prices have soared. &quot;Those three product segments have generated growth potential and earnings opportunity,&quot; Mr. Cuhney says.    Trailing the pack in growth potential, he believes, are Advanced Micro Devices and National Semiconductor Corp., due to an over-reliance on commodity chips.    To be sure, Advanced Micro earlier this week posted a near-quintupling of profit, but Wall Street looked beyond earnings to its stagnant profit margins and its lower rate of new orders. That rate flattened out to a level even with shipments, while the industry reported orders strongly in excess of shipments for the same period. As a result, the stock fell $1.375 to $15 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange and slipped a further 12.5 cents to $14.875 yesterday.    National Semiconductor challenges Mr. Cuhney's view. &quot;If you look at our fourth quarter, excluding the Fairchild portion, we've been growing at about 20%, which is in line with the industry and, I think, very respectable,&quot; said a National Semiconductor spokesman. But he conceded, &quot;It's true that Intel (with its 50% to 60% growth rate) is unique, and DRAMS are growing fast,&quot; helping other companies.    Analysts say the big question now is whether Intel can sustain that kind of growth. Mr. Grove wants to cool overheated expectations. &quot;The third quarter promises to be pretty strong, but it can't go on indefinitely,&quot; he cautions. &quot;No market is capable of (sustaining) 50% to 60% year-to-year growth.&quot;    Drew Peck, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., says the evolution of a two-tiered, product-driven semiconductor market represents a fundamental change from the past. Three or four years ago, he says, &quot;most companies were in basically the same business, selling basically the same commodity products to basically the same customers. After the recession of 1985, and with the recovery of 1986-87, there was a major shift toward proprietary and company-specific products.&quot;    Kidder's Mr. Cuhney goes further. &quot;Intel now has an almost monopolistic control of the core technology for office workstations,&quot; he says. Formerly, Intel licensed alternate suppliers, but with its current-generation 80386 microprocessor it now is the sole supplier of the chip that's at the heart of such products as the IBM PS/2 models and the Compaq2 DeskPro 386, he adds.    Intel's Mr. Grove counters: &quot;I'd say we're a major participant. I'd prefer that to monopolistic monster.&quot;    Mr. Peck says companies without a product like the 80386 have &quot;flatter growth and less product leverage.&quot;    Still, Texas Instruments argues its DRAM success has boosted its manufacturing prowess in a way that translates to all its product lines, including its logic, military and applications specific microprocessor line. In all areas, a spokesman contends, &quot;We're strong.&quot;    As for what the balance of 1988 portends, Donaldson Lufkin's Mr. Peck predicts conservatively that Texas Instruments will report second-quarter profit of $68 million, or 80 cents a share, for a 70% increase from year-earlier net before the big windfall from royalties. He predicts revenue will rise 18% to $1.6 billion. Texas Instruments wouldn't comment on the forecast.    Motorola's second quarter, by Mr. Peck's crystal ball, could include 60% profit growth to $125 million, or 95 cents a share, on revenue growth of 23% to $2.03 billion. Motorola also declined to comment on the estimate.    National Semiconductor, whose fiscal first quarter ends in August, is expected to post profit of $20.7 million, or 19 cents a share, almost double the year-earlier first quarter, although flat with the preceding quarter. Revenue is expected to be about $660 million, Mr. Peck says, up about 28% from the like period last year. National Semiconductor said those figures are in the right ballpark. </TEXT></DOC>
