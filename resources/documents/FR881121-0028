The ANPRM invited commentfrom the public on drug and alcohol abuse by personnel in the aviationindustry and the options available to the FAA for regulatory or other actionin the interest of aviation safety. The FAA received over 650 written commentsin response to the issues raised in the ANPRM.On March 3, 1988, the FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)(53 FR 8368; March 14, 1988) entitled ``Anti-Drug Program for PersonnelEngaged in Specified Aviation Activities.'' The NPRM set forth an analysisof the comments received on the ANPRM and proposed regulations for publiccomment. The FAA received over 260 written comments on the proposals containedin the NPRM.The FAA also held a series of public hearings on the regulations proposedin the NPRM. These hearings were held on June 2, 1988, in Washington, DC;June 7, 1988, in Denver, Colorado; and June 9, 1988, in San Francisco,California. Each of the hearings was recorded by a court reporter. Thetranscript of each hearing and any statements or other material, submittedto the hearing panel during the hearings, have been placed in the publicdocket. This material also has been reviewed in the development of thefinal rule.<T3>Current Rules. </T3>The FAA's comprehensive anti-drug program is oneaction in a long history of actions to combat the use of drugs and alcoholin the aviation industry. The focus of the majority of these actions hasbeen on commercial aviation personnel, particularly the cockpit and cabincrew. For example, pilots, flight attendants, flight engineers, and flightnavigators may not act as a crewmember of a civil aircraft within eighthours after drinking an alcoholic beverage; while under the influence ofalcohol; with 0.04 percent, or more, alcohol in their blood; or while usingany drug that affects their faculties in any way contrary to safety. Also,crewmembers may be tested in the context of receiving medical care immediatelyafter an accident. When there is a reasonable basis to suspect that oneof these individuals has violated any of the above restrictions, thesecrewmembers must furnish, to the FAA, the results of any test taken withinfour hours of acting, or attempting to act, as a crewmember that indicatesthe presence of alcohol or any such drug in the person's system. Moreover,pilots, flight attendants, flight engineers, and flight navigators arerequired to submit to a test to indicate the percentage of alcohol in theblood when requested by a law enforcement officer who suspects that a crewmembermay have violated a State or local law governing the operation of an aircraftwhile under the influence, or impaired by, drugs or alcohol.The FAA may deny an application for a certificate or rating for up to oneyear, or may suspend or revoke an existing certificate or rating, in thecase of any pilot, flight engineer, or flight navigator who has been convictedof violating a Federal or State law relating to drug trafficking or possession;who has violated the proscriptions described above; who has refused tofurnish the results of any test that would indicate the presence of alcoholor drugs taken within four hours of acting, or attempting to act, as acrewmember; or who has refused to submit to an alcohol test requested bya law enforcement officer investigating violations of State or local laws.The FAA also may deny an application for a certificate or rating for upto one year, or may suspend or revoke an existing certificate or rating,in the case of any air traffic control tower operator, aircraft dispatcher,mechanic, repairman, or parachute rigger who has been convicted of a violationof a Federal or State law relating to drug trafficking or possession.The Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control Act of 1984, which added languageto sections 602 and 609 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, mandates thatthe FAA take certain actions regarding airmen involved in drug traffickingactivities. The Administrator is required to revoke the airman certificateof any airman who has been convicted of violating any Federal or Statelaw relating to a controlled substance, other than simple possession, ifan aircraft was used in, or was used to facilitate, the commission of theoffense and the person served as an airman, or was onboard the aircraft,in connection with the commission of the offense. The Administrator hasno discretion to review the conviction for the substantive offense. Underthe 1984 legislation, the Administrator was prohibited from reissuing acertificate to that airman for up to five years but could reissue a certificateafter an absolute minimum of one year, in certain extremely limited circumstances,if revocation was excessive and contrary to the public interest. As partof the Federal Aviation Administration Drug Enforcement Assistance Actof 1988, Congress amended sections 602 and 609 of the FAA Act, among otheramendments to the Act, in October 1988. The statutory language now providesthat the Administrator shall not issue an airman certificate to any personwhose certificate has been revoked for aviation drug trafficking activitiesunless the airman is acquitted of the offense, a conviction upon whichrevocation is based is reversed on appeal, or the Administrator determinesthat issuance of an airman certificate will facilitate law enforcementefforts after a request from a Federal or State law enforcement official.The final rule requiring a comprehensive anti-drug program for employeesin commercial aviation is consistent with these previous actions takenby the FAA. The FAA's commitment to a drug-free workforce also applies to its own employees.The Department of Transportation began random drug testing of DOT employeesin safety- and security-sensitive functions in September 1987. The Secretary'sgoal is to establish and maintain a drug-free workplace as intended byExecutive Order 12564 and as directed by Presidential memorandum datedOctober 4, 1986. It is the opinion of the Department of Transportationthat random drug testing is the most effective means of determining thepresence of drugs or drug metabolites that may adversely affect an employee'sperformance of safety- or security-sensitive job functions. Pursuant tothe Department's program, an employee of the Department will be removedfrom Federal service under several circumstances: refusal to enter or tosuccessfully complete a drug rehabilitation or abatement program; repeatusage of drugs; refusal to provide a urine specimen for drug testing; adulterationor substitution of a urine specimen; on-duty use of illegal drugs; or adetermination that a DOT employee has engaged in illegal drug trafficking.In order to ensure that aviation safety is not compromised by a failureto detect drug users in the aviation industry, the FAA believes that itis appropriate and necessary to establish a comprehensive anti-drug programat this time.<T3>Existing Industry Programs.</T3> As part of their comments to the ANPRMand the NPRM, many employers note that they have implemented drug testingprograms or employee rehabilitation programs. For example, although theirdrug testing programs were not specifically described, Martin Aviationimplemented a drug testing program in February 1987 and Suburban Airlineshas required preemployment drug testing of flight crew applicants for overa year. Federal Express Corporation currently conducts preemployment testingof all applicants and ``reasonable suspicion testing'' of all employees.Tramco, Inc. is a certificated repair station employing over 600 individualsand repairing over 100 aircraft per year. Tramco instituted a drug testingand counseling program ``several years ago'' and believes that the programyields substantial benefits to both employees and employers. Tramco testsall applicants for jobs and conducts tests based on probable cause. Tramco'stests based on probable cause are triggered by reports of employee druguse, employee attendance patterns that may suggest a drug problem, accidents,and observation by supervisors. A Tramco employee who tests positive fordrugs is suspended for a minimum of one week and may not return to workuntil a drug test shows no evidence of drug use. Tramco estimates that,consistent with general statistics, 20 percent of its workforce has hadsome involvement with controlled substances. As of the time of its commentto the NPRM, Tramco identified 10 percent of its employees as individualswho had used drugs.Rocky Mountain Helicopters, Inc. implemented a drug testing program forits employees in July 1986. Rocky Mountain Helicopters tests all pilots,mechanics managers, and others who can affect aviation safety using preemployment,random, probable cause, and postaccident testing. Rocky Mountain Helicoptersdoes not pay an employee's rehabilitation costs but will consider rehiringany employee who completes an approved rehabilitation program. PetroleumHelicopters, Inc. began a preemployment and periodic testing program in1982 and supports mandatory drug testing. Petroleum Helicopters deniesemployment to any applicant, and discharges any employee, who tests positivein a drug test. Petroleum Helicopters does not concur with the proposalto provide a rehabilitation opportunity to employees on the basis thatan employer should not accept the risk of repeated illegal drug use amongmaintenance or flight personnel.The FAA believes that the comprehensive anti-drug program, promulgatedby this final rule, is not a novel concept. In light of the FAA's longhistory of regulatory action in the area of drug use in aviation and thesignificant number of industry drug testing programs currently implementedby aviation employers, the FAA believes that the agency is justified inrequiring the commercial aviation industry to implement similar comprehensiveanti-drug programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>General Overview of the Major IssuesThe FAA received 261 comments in response to the NPRM. The FAA consideredall timely-filed comments submitted in response to the NPRM and the testimonyof 20 individuals who presented statements at the three public hearingsheld by the FAA. During the public hearings, the Secretary of Transportation,James H. Burnley, requested information from several individuals who presentedstatements at the hearings. The comment period for the NPRM closed on June13, 1988. In order to accommodate the individuals who submitted supplementalinformation pursuant to the Secretary's request, the FAA also consideredcomments that were submitted as late as July 1, 1988.There were several major themes presented by the commenters. Many commentersfocus on the lack of evidence of significant drug use or drug abuse inthe aviation industry. The commenters particularly stress this point withrespect to the cockpit crew based on age, income, managerial supervision,close working relationships with peers, periodic medical exams to determinefitness for duty, and professionalism of the crew. Based on the lack ofevidence, these commenters conclude that establishment of a drug testingprogram is unwarranted and unconstitutional. Regardless of the amount ofevidence, the majority of commenters agree with the FAA's assessment thatdrug use and substance abuse have no place in the aviation environment.Some commenters note that the FAA's anti-drug stance is commendable, butthe true issue is the type of program that evolves from that stance. Manycommenters support the FAA's efforts to develop a comprehensive anti-drugprogram that would achieve a drug-free commercial aviation workforce andagree that a program to achieve a drug-free aviation environment is beneficial.There is substantial, although not universal, support for a drug testingprogram using state-of-the-art urine testing. The gas chromotography/massspectrometry (GC/MS) method, approved by the Department of Health and HumanServices (DHHS), is recognized by the commenters as the most accurate methodof analysis for the presence of drugs or drug metabolites in urine if rigorouscollection and analysis procedures, such as those contained in the DHHAmandatory guidelines, are followed. (As discussed in detail elsewhere inthis preamble, the Department of Transportation is publishing ``Proceduresfor Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' which are adoptedin this final rule in lieu of the DHHS guidelines. These DOT-wide proceduresclosely resemble the DHHS guidelines and are used because the DHHS guidelinesare not drafted for application by entities other than Federal agencies.)While some concerns were raised about the testing procedures, these concernsgenerally involve drug testing programs and procedures in the early 1980sthat did not embody the critical safeguards of a properly-administeredtesting program.Certain types of testing proposed in the NPRM receive significant supportby the commenters. These types of testing include preemployment testingand postaccident testing. Periodic testing and testing based on reasonablecause received substantial support from the commenters. Some support fortesting based on reasonable cause is predicated on traditional constitutionalstandards that apply to a search of the person.There is significant and strongly-held opposition to random testing. However,the FAA's drug testing program, including random testing as a criticalelement, is supported by some commenters. The objections to random testingare based on legal or constitutional issues, privacy issues, and the invasivenature of random testing based on personal grounds, cost issues, and theabsence of a demonstrated need for a comprehensive testing program assuminga low level of drug use in the industry.Of those commenters who address the issue, there is agreement that thecomplexity, cost, and operational impact burdens of the rule would be significantlygreater on small entities in the aviation industry. Finally, the commentersexpress significantly different opinions in the area of employee assistanceprograms (EAP). The primary differences surround the issues of the circumstancesunder which an employee is offered an opportunity for rehabilitation andthe entity or individual who is responsible for payment of rehabilitationcosts. Several major air carriers have already addressed this issue throughinsurance coverage or by labor-management agreement. However, even someof these organizations, although supportive of EAPs, oppose a broad, Federally-mandatedEAP requirement. Labor organizations clearly support expansive EAP opportunitiesand services. Small entities oppose EAP requirements on many grounds, includingcost and possible negative coworker attitudes exhibited toward rehabilitatedemployees.The commenters differ regarding the method of achieving a drug-free aviationworkforce and the manner in which the FAA would be involved in any program.The primary differences arise regarding the type and scope of testing usedto identify sensitive safety- or security-related personnel who use drugsand the choices offered to those individuals who are identified as drugusers.<T3>Labor Unions and Organizations Representing Employees.</T3> In general,unions or organizations representing employees in aviation oppose the comprehensivemandatory drug testing proposed in the NPRM. Labor unions and employeeorganizations favor EAP and broad rehabilitation rights for all employees.These organizations oppose random drug testing but, with some qualifications,these organizations see a role for preemployment testing, postaccidenttesting, testing based on reasonable cause, and testing during and afterrehabilitation to monitor an individual's progress.The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM)opposes any industry-wide drug and alcohol testing until hard evidenceof an industry drug problem that jeopardizes aviation safety is substantiatedand documented. The Independent Union of Flight Attendants (IUFA) opposesall forms of mandatory drug testing of employees. The Independent Federationof Flight Attendants (IFFA) objects generally to drug testing as unwarrantedgovernmental intervention into labor-management relations but would supportpreemployment screening and postaccident testing if reasonable cause forsuch testing can be objectively illustrated. IFFA objects specificallyto random testing in any form as unconstitutional and contrary to laborlaw. IFFA believes that the focus of any drug testing program should belimited to impairment on the job and states that no currently availabletesting procedure can determine drug impairment on the job. The Associationof Flight Attendants (AFA) believes that drug testing of flight attendantsis not warranted. However, AFA and the Association of Professional FlightAttendants (APFA) support preemployment testing of applicants seeking jobsin the industry if that testing is not used to discriminate against applicantson the basis of disabilities unrelated to drug use. AFA also would notoppose postaccident testing of pilots or probable cause drug testing ofemployees who are under the influence of drugs if these samples were collectedby an FAA inspector. APFA opposes random testing, postaccident testingabsent individualized suspicion, and testing based on reasonable causeas proposed. The Flight Engineers' International Association (FEIA) opposesall testing except in the case where probable cause exists to believe thatan employee is impaired by drugs; in order to protect employees from harassment,FEIA states that any determination to test an employee based on probablecause for impairment should be reviewed by a neutral party. The TeamstersUnion could support preemployment screening; testing based on reasonablesuspicion to believe that an employee's actual or current impairment has,or is, affecting job performance or workplace safety; periodic testingto maintain medical certification; and testing after an accident or a ``nearmiss'' if there is a reasonable basis to suspect that human error may havebeen a casual factor.The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), representing 41,000 pilots employedby 44 large and small airlines, is firmly opposed to all forms of drugand alcohol abuse by airline personnel. ALPA primarily is opposed to randomand periodic testing based on their belief that these tests are offensive,ineffectual, unjustified, and unconstitutional. ALPA believes that if thereis drug use among commercial pilots, the incidence of drug use would beless than 0.5 percent. On this basis, ALPA asserts that widescale randomtesting of the relatively small aviation population will result in a significantnumber of false-positive test results. ALPA does not oppose testing priorto employment, testing after an accident, testing in circumstances wherethere are reasonable grounds to suspect drug use, and testing to monitorrehabilitation.ALPA believes that the approach to the drug abuse problem articulated inthe NPRM is inappropriate. ALPA instead urges the FAA to consider an approachsimilar to the Human Intervention Motivation Study (HIMS) program developedto identify and treat alcoholism among pilots. The key elements of theHIMS program are education, peer involvement, intervention, confrontation,and rahabilitation. Although the HIMS program has focused on treatmentof pilots who demonstrate a problem with alcohol, ALPA sponsored a HIMSdrug abuse training program in November 1987 which the FAA attended.Labor and employee organizations also strongly support limitations on anemployer's ability to exclude any employee from an opportunity for rehabilitationand limitations on an employer's ability to discharge an employee. Mostorganizations, including IUFA, IFFA, AFA, and APFA, strongly support regulationsthat would require an employer to establish and participate in comprehensive,nonpunitive EAP services established by collective bargaining or negotiationand available to all employees. ALPA agrees that any regulations shouldclearly recognize that unions have collective bargaining rights under Federallabor laws; ALPA suggests that any anti-drug regulations promulgated bythe FAA should ensure that the regulatory requirements do not interfereor override the union's collective bargaining rights. FEIA supports EAPservices, mandatory for each carrier and paid for by the carrier, for rehabilitationof all employees regardless of the circumstances that precipitated a drugtest. IAM suggests that FAA regulations should be guidelines, applicableonly to carriers who have a documented substance abuse problem affectingaviation safety, that stress education, prevention, rehabilitation, andprotection of an employee's privacy.<T3>Employers and Organizations Representing Employers. </T3>Most employerssupport mandatory drug testing of employees and limitations on an employee'sopportunity for rehabilitation. Part 121 and Part 135 certificate holdersdo not express the same opinions regarding the proposals in the NPRM. Thegeneral views held by Part 121 certificate holders are characterized bythe comments submitted by the Air Transport Association of America (ATA).ATA supports the FAA's comprehensive drug testing program and favors anopportunity for rehabilitation only for those employees who volunteer forrehabilitation. In the area of EAP services, Part 121 certificate holdersgenerally favor flexibility and latitude for an employer to design a companyEAP. American Airlines, however, favors industry-wide standard EAP requirements.Most Part 135 certificate holders and small aviation businesses objectto the drug testing requirements proposed in the NPRM. The Regional AirlineAssociation (RAA), which represents many Part 135 certificate holders,opposes random testing; RAA also suggests that the random selection ratebe set at a rate less than the maximum 125 percent rate proposed in theNPRM if the FAA mandates a random testing requirement. The Primary objectionof Part 135 certificate holders and small businesses is to the proposedrequirement to offer an opportunity for rehabilitation to an employee.These organizations oppose mandated rehabiliation because of the economicburden that would be imposed on a small operator. The National Air TransportAssociation (NATA) suggests, in its June 2, 1988 testimony, that Part 135certificate holders employing 100 or fewer covered employees should beexempted from all requirements of the proposed anti-drug program.Grace Flying Service, Inc., a Part 135 certificate holder conducting single-engineair taxi services, flight instruction, and aerial application services,opposes drug testing of employees. Grace Flying Service strenuously objectsto any drug tests, whether scheduled or random, and would be reluctantto test its employees even if testing is mandated by the FAA.The National Business Aircraft Association (NBAA) concurs with the FAA'santi-drug program with certain reservations. NBAA primarily is concernedabout the constitutionality of random drug testing and the FAA's relianceon laboratory testing results that may be unreliable in detecting drugsor drug metabolites proposed to be analyzed in the NPRM.<T3>Individual Commenters. </T3>The FAA received 170 comments from individuals.The majority of these individuals are pilots employed by major airlinesand self-employed pilots who would be subject to the requirements of theproposed rule. The FAA also received comments from general aviation pilotsand individuals who are not employed in the commercial aviation industry.The vast majority of the individual commenters oppose the drug testingrequirements of the proposed rule based on constitutional objections, failureof the FAA to demonstrate a drug problem in the aviation community, andperceived inaccuracies of drug testing collection and analysis. A minorityof individual commenters generally support the FAA's anti-drug proposalsand primarily support the testing requirements. These individuals are privatecitizens or consumers who base their support on the need to ensure thataviation personnel are drug free, particularly on the job. The strongestindividual support is expressed by letters from the family and friendsof a passenger who was killed in the crash of Continental Air Express Flight2286 near Durango, Colorado. The comments from the family and friends ofthe deceased passenger urge the FAA to do everything within its statutoryauthority to prevent a similar tragedy in the future. Specific Issues <T3>Discussion of the constitutional issues regarding random and periodicdrug testing.</T3> A number of commenters have questioned the constitutionalityof drug testing programs for aviation personnel. Although the state ofthe case law is still evolving in rapid fashion and no definitive SupremeCourt resolution of many relevant and complex issues has been achieved,the FAA feels confident that testing required under this rule will passconstitutional scrutiny. The FAA recognizes that there are legitimate andsignificant constitutional concerns surrounding drug testing in generaland random drug testing as a specific component of drug testing. The FAAacknowledges the current widescale litigation and apparent disparate judicialopinions on drug testing programs. <T3>FAA Response. </T3>The principles of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S.Constitution are paramount in scrutinizing the fundamental legality ofmany drug testing programs. As a threshold legal matter, the Fourth Amendmentapplies to ``searches'' conducted or mandated by the government and protectsindividuals against ``unreasonable searches and seizures.'' Action of aprivate party does not constitute State (or Federal) action unless thereexists a close nexus between the state and the action in question. <T3>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison, </T3>419 U.S. 345 (1974); <T3>Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, </T3>407 U.S. 163 (1972). Assuming that the drug testing programs called for under the final ruledo implicate the government, a second issue then arises concerning whetherurine tests under these programs are ``searches'' within the meaning ofthe Fourth Amendment. Although most courts to address the issue to datehave ruled that toxicological testing of employees for the purpose of determiningfitness for duty is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,the issue is not entirely settled. <T3>See Wyman v. James, </T3>400 U.S. 309, 317-338 (1971) (government welfarecaseworker's ``home visit'' as a precondition for assistance payments isnot a Fourth Amendment search). <T3>See also, Lovvorn v. City of Chattanooga, </T3>846 F.2d 1539, 1553-1554(6th Cir. 1988) (Guy, J., dissenting), <T3>panel decision vacated and rehearing en banc ordered, </T3>(August3, 1988); <T3>National Treasury Employees Union v. von Raab, </T3>808 F.2d 1057,1060, 1062 (5th Cir. 1987) (Higginbotham, J., concurring). <T3>Cf. Mack v. United States, F.B.I., </T3>814 F.2d 120, 125 n.2 (2ndCir. 1987). Also assuming, <T3>arguendo, </T3>that urine tests of aviation personnel for illegal drugsare ``searches'' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, it is clearthat while searches ordinarily must be conducted pursuant to a warrantissued on probable cause grounds, such a requirement is not always necessary.<T3>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, </T3>413 U.S. 266, 277 (1973) (Powell,J., concurring). Where, for example, ``* * * the burden of obtaining awarrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search* * *,'' [<T3>Camera v. Municipal Court,</T3> 387 U.S. 523, 533 (1967)], the SupremeCourt has routinely held that a warrant is not required by the Fourth Amendment.<T3>See e.g., Griffin v. Wisconsin,</T3> 107 S.Ct. 3164, 3167 (1987); <T3>New Jersey v. T.L.O., </T3>469 U.S. 325, 340 (1985). The Supreme Courthas likewise found that the probable cause standard is inappropriate whereit would defeat the purpose that the search is designed to achieve. <T3>See e.g., New Jersey v. T.L.O.,</T3> 469 U.S. at 340-342; <T3>O'Connor v. Ortega, </T3>107 S.Ct. 1492, 1501-1502 (1987) (pluralityopinion) (upholding the search of a public employee's office for work-relatednoninvestigatory reasons on less than probable cause grounds); <T3>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </T3>428 U.S. 543, 560-561 (1976)(footnotes omitted) (while ``* * * some quantum of individualized suspicionis usually a prerequisite to constitutional search or seizure,] * * * theFourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion'').Rather, ``[t]he fundamental command of the Fourth Amendment is that searchesand seizures be reasonable * * *.'' <T3>New Jersey v. T.L.O., </T3>469 U.S. at 340. In determining the reasonablenessof a search, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed the importance ofthe facts particular to the search while acknowledging that the test ofreasonableness ``* * * is not capable of precise definition or mechanicalapplication.'' <T3>Bell v. Wolfish,</T3> 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). In analyzing a drugtesting program, ``* * * what is reasonable depends on the context withinwhich a search takes place.'' <T3>New Jersey v. T.L.O.,</T3> 469 U.S. at 337.  In scrutinizing whether particular searches comport with the Fourth Amendment,courts have adopted a balancing test. In general, to support a claim thata search of an individual or the individual's property is reasonable, thegovernment must demonstrate that, on balance, the public's legitimate interestin conducting the search outweighs the individual's legitimate expectationof privacy. <T3>See e.g., United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, </T3>473 U.S. 531,537 (1985); <T3>United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, </T3>462 U.S. 579, 588 (1983);<T3>Delaware v. Prouse, </T3>440 U.S. 648, 654 (1979). Thus, the courtsmust ``*** consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner inwhich it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the placein which it is conducted.'' <T3>Bell v. Wolfish,</T3> 441 U.S. at 559. Viewed in this light, it is beyond dispute that the public has an overridinginterest in assuring that sensitive safety- and security-related aviationpersonnel perform their duties free of illegal drugs. The drug problemin society in general and evidence of drug use in the aviation industryin particular are documented elsewhere in the preamble of this final rule.The impairing effects of illegal drugs and the substantial risks to publicsafety posed by aviation employees who use illegal drugs underlies thecompelling governmental interests in promulgating this final rule. In contrast, the drug testing requirements of the final rule involve aminimal invasion of privacy. As the Supreme Court has indicated, wheresearches are undertaken in situations where individualized suspicion islacking, other safeguards must be relied upon to ensure that the discretionof the party conducting the search is properly defined and the scope ofthe search is limited. <T3>See Delaware v. Prouse, </T3>440 U.S. at 654-655 (footnote omitted);<T3>New York v. Burger, </T3>107 S.Ct. 2636, 2648 (1987). The drug testingrequirements of the final rule place significant constraints on an employer'sdiscretion in conducting drug testing. For example, the requirement forrandom drug testing calls for selection of an employee to be tested ina scientifically-acceptable manner, such as use of a computer-based randomnumber generator. Requirements for testing based on reasonable cause orpostaccident testing also are severely circumscribed in order to limitan employer's discretion in administering such tests to employees. Also,the FAA will review the actual employer anti-drug programs, required tobe submitted to the agency in accordance with provisions of the final rule,to ensure that discretion is in fact limited in the administration of drugtests under these programs. <T3>Cf. National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan,</T3> No. 86-4058,slip op. at 14 (E.D.La. April 29, 1988) (holding that the constitutionalityof Executive Order requiring Federal agencies to establish drug testingprograms for Federal employees was not ripe for review since each agencyhad not implemented a finalized, particular plan). The actual testing procedures that each employer is required to implementunder this final rule also are tailored narrowly to respect an employee'sreasonable expectation of privacy. The DOT procedures governing collectionof urine samples, which are based on the DHHS guidelines, are carefullydesigned to preserve privacy while protecting the integrity of the sample.The final rule contains a number of important employee safeguards, includingprivacy during collection under the majority of circumstances, stringentlaboratory safeguards, and provisions for challenging results. Other employeedrug testing programs incorporating the collection and testing proceduresof the DHHS guidelines have been upheld against constitutional attack.The DOT procedures so closely resemble the DHHS guidelines in all pertinentrespects that the Department of Transportation is confident that theseprocedures also will be upheld. <T3>See American Federation of Government Employees v. Dole, </T3>670 F.Supp.45 (D.D.C. 1987), <T3>appeal docketed, </T3>No. 87-5417 (D.C.Cir. Dec. 11, 1987) (upholdingthe constitutionality of the Department of Transportation program for randomdrug testing of safety- and security-sensitive agency employees); <T3>National Association of Air Traffic Specialists v. Dole, </T3>2 Ind.Emp.Rts.Cases (BNA) 68 (D.Alaska 1987) (denying a motion for a preliminary injunctionagainst the FAA's use of urinalysis drug testing as part of an annual physicalexamination of the agency's air traffic specialists). Equally significant is the fact that urine drug testing of sensitive safety-and security-related employees is to be conducted in the ``context'' ofthe employment relationship. As the Supreme Court has pointed out, ``[t]heoperational realities of the workplace *** may make <T3>some</T3> employees' expectation of privacy unreasonable.'' <T3>O'Connor v. Ortega,</T3> 107 S.Ct. at 1498. This is particularly importantin circumstances where the employee works in an industry in which his orher activities are subject to extensive regulation. Thus, persons who workin such ``closely regulated'' industries have a ``reduced expectation ofprivacy'' [<T3>New York v. Burger,</T3> 107 S.Ct. at 2646] and, ``in effect consent[]to the restrictions placed upon them'' [<T3>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States,</T3> 413 U.S. at 271]. For thesevery reasons, two Federal courts of appeals have upheld urinalysis testing,in the absence of particularized suspicion, in industries where pervasiveregulation has reduced an employee's expectation of privacy. <T3>See Rushton v. Nebraska Public Power Dist., </T3>844 F.2d 562, 566(8th Cir. 1988) (nuclear plant operators); <T3>Shoemaker v. Handel, </T3>795 F.2d 1136, 1142 (3rd Cir.), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>479 U.S. 986 (1986) (jockeys); <T3>Policemen's Benevolent Ass'n., Local 318 v. Township of Washington,</T3>850 F.2d 133 (3rd Cir. 1988) (police officers). It is beyond dispute that aviation has always been subject to pervasiveregulation by the government and by employers themselves. As one Federaldistrict court has noted:<ITAG tagnum="21">[t]he rationale of the Third Circuit upholding drug urinalysis forjockeys in order to protect the integrity of horse racing is even morecompelling when the public need for air safety is considered. If horseracing is recognized as a closely or pervasively regulated activity, thenaviation activities and the aviation industry are as much or possibly moreclosely regulated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Indeed, the creation of a federal agency charged with the responsibilityfor ensuring safe air travel reflects the public interest in air safety.* * * [T]he public perception of air safety not only is critical to theairline industry but to all who fly. * * * [C]lose and pervasive regulationof aviation related activities is well established and * * * air safetyrelates to serious risk or hazards which require close and constant attention.<T3>National Association of Air Traffic Control Specialists v. Dole, </T3>2Ind. Emp. Rts. Cases (BNA) at 78.</ITAG>The FAA recognizes that a number of Federal and State courts have rejectedgovernment-mandated drug testing program of Fourth Amendment grounds. However,even courts striking drug testing programs have recognized that drug testingis appropriate in other contexts. <T3>See e.g., Lovvorn v. City of Chattanooga, </T3>846 F.2d at 1553-1554(Martin, J.) (``When determining, then, whether a mandatory drug searchis `reasonable,' we believe that, as the costs to society of an inpairedemployee increase, the requisite level of suspicion that a drug problemexists decreases.''); <T3>Policemen's Benevolent Ass'n, Local 318 v. Township of Washington,</T3>672 F.Supp. 779, 792 (D.N.J. 1987), <T3>rev'd, </T3>850 F.2d 133 (3rd Cir. 1988) (``[T]he need to prevent amajor airline disaster presents a far more compelling rationale than thosepresented by the municipality in support of testing its police officers.'');<T3>American Federation of Government Employees v. Meese, </T3>No. C-88-1419-SAW(N.D.Cal. June 16, 1988) (issuing a preliminary injunction against a Bureauof Prison plan to test randomly all agency employees but nonetheless notingthat ``[t]here are cases in which compulsory drug testing may be justifiedin the interest of public safety or security.'' Memorandum opinion at 2).The FAA also is aware of the recent Ninth Circuit decision holding unconstitutionalregulations promulgated by the Federal Railroad Administration_mandatingblood and urine tests of railroad employees who are involved in certaintrain accidents and fatal incidents and authorizing breath and urine testsafter certain accidents, incidents, and rule violations_because the rulesdo not require a showing of ``particularized suspicion'' drug or alcoholimpairment prior to testing. <T3>Railway Labor Executive' Association v. Burnley, </T3>839 F.2d 575(9th Cir.), <T3>cert. granted, </T3>108 S.Ct. 2033 (1988). The Ninth Circuit basedits views, in part, on the proposition that ``* * * the vast bulk of [railroad]safety regulation is directed at owners and managers of railroads, notemployees.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 585. The U.S. government disagrees with the Ninth Circuitpanel's decision, which is contrary to rulings in other Federal appellatecourts. Moreover, contrary to the Ninth Circuit's views of the FederalRailroad Administration's jurisdiction over railroad employees, FAA's jurisdictionover employees in the aviation industry is clear and should not be subjectto challenge on this basis.The Supreme Court has granted the government's petition for a <T3>writ of certiorari </T3>in <T3>Railway Labor Executives' Association v. Burnley </T3>and has orderedthat this case be argued this term ``in tandem'' with <T3>National Treasury Employees Union v. von Raab, </T3>816 F.2d 170 (5thCir. 1987), <T3>cert. granted, </T3>108 S.Ct. 1072 (1988) (upholding drug testing ofapplicants for critical safety or security sensitive positions in the U.S.Customs Service). Decisions in these cases may not be forthcoming untilthe spring of 1989. However, in the absense of Supreme Court guidance,the FAA remains convinced that the need for drug testing by urinalysisin the aviation industry to determine fitness for duty of sensitive safety-orsecurity-related employees and, thereby, to ensure public safety clearlyoutweighs the privacy interest of individuals in this class.While not totally free from doubt, it is the opinion of the Departmentof Transportation that the FAA's anti-drug program, and similar regimensproposed by other administrations within the Department, will be determinedto be constitutional. The critical need for properly-administered drugtesting to ensure that employees in the transportation industry do nothave drugs or drug metabolites in their system while performing sensitivesafety- and security-related functions outweighs the reduced privacy interestof these employees.<T3>Lack of Evidence of a Drug Problem in the Aviation Industry.</T3> Nearlyevery commenter who opposes drug testing in general, and random testingin particular, and even commenters who support the comprehensive drug testingproposals, raise the issue of lack of evidence of a drug problem in commercialaviation. On this basis, the commenters assert that the FAA can not justifythe comprehensive proposals contained in the NPRM. ALPA, the Aircraft Ownersand Pilots Association, (AOPA), and the organizations representing flightattendants maintain that the industry should police itself in the areaof drug use and abuse. <T3>FAA Response.</T3> The FAA made no attempt to obscure the lack of widespreadevidence of drug use or abuse among commercial aviation personnel. However,after publication of the NPRM in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 14, 1988, federal investigators releasedpreliminary data showing that the captain of Continental Air Express Flight2286, which crashed in Durango, Colorado on January 19, 1988, may havebeen impaired by drugs while operating the aircraft. A preliminary reportof the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) indicates that toxicologicaltest results show that the captain of Flight 2286 had cocaine and a cocainemetabolite in his system at the time of the crash. Seven passengers andthe pilot and copilot died in the accident. In 1983, the NTSB issued an Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB/AAR-84/11) onthe crash of Central Airlines Flight 27 in Newark, New Jersey, on March30, 1983. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the crash of theGates Learjet nonscheduled, cargo-carrying aircraft included ``impairmentof the flight crew's judgment, decisionmaking, and flying abilities bya combination of physiological and psychological factors.'' The NTSB didnot conclude that drug-impaired performance was the sole cause of the crash.However, the report does state that test results indicate that the captainhad used marijuana and the copilot had used, or been exposed to, marijuanawithin the 24 hours preceding the crash. Also, toxicological tests indicatethat the copilot's urine showed evidence of contra-indicated use of anantihistamine drug. Additional evidence of illegal drug use by individuals employed in theairline industry appeared in the fall of 1986, when a series of articlesin the Pittsburgh Press, based on interviews with emergency room staffsat area hospitals, highlighted 23 cases of airline flight crew drug abuse.Twenty of those cases involved cocaine overdoses, two were heroin reactions,and one dealt with valium and alcohol. Twelve cockpit crewmembers and elevencabin crewmembers were among those treated by Pittsburg area hospitalsfor drug use. Personnel at those hospitals also indicated that they hadtreated numerous cases of drug abuse among non-flight employees, such asmechanics. The Pittsburgh Press also surveyed 17 drug treatment clinicsacross the country and found that more than 69 pilots had been treatedfor cocaine addiction. A subsequent FBI investigation of drug use in thePittsburgh area produced evidence that a number of airline employees, includingcockpit, cabin, and ground crewmembers, had used cocaine, marijuana, andother illegal drugs, sometimes on duty or shortly before reporting forduty. The NPRM also included comments by a Part 121 and Part 135 certificateholder that implemented an unannounced drug testing program applicableto its employees. This company reported that 2.5 percent of its 180 pilotsand 4 percent of its 240 mechanics tested positive for a trace, or more,of illegal drug in their system. Data from the airline industry regardingpreemployment screening of applicants for various positions indicate thatthe number of positive drug tests ranges from 4.2 percent to 20 percentwith results as high as 25 percent to 30 percent in some geographical locations.Although this data does not show an overwhelming drug problem in commercialaviation, it does show concrete evidence of drug use in the commercialaviation sector. The FAA recognizes that commercial aviation personneloperate in a professional and highly-regulated environment. However, pursuantto the FAA's statutory mandate to ensure aviation safety, the FAA alsomust acknowledge that commercial aviation personnel are not immune to,nor insulated from, drug use or abuse that may affect safety-critical jobperformance. The FAA believes that any drug use in commercial aviationwarrants preventive and proactive intervention by the FAA to ensure aviationsafety. The FAA believes that this view is not inconsistent with the increasingawareness of several aviation employers who currently have, as disclosedin their comments, basic drug testing and employee rehabilitation programsfor their employees. Although not a universally-expressed opinion among the commenters, ATA``fully embrace[s] the philosophy, expressed in the NPRM, that individualswho wish to work in aviation activities that involve the safety of passengers,co-workers, and others must not use illicit drugs, even while off-duty.''Several commenters, including RAA, note that to the extent any drug useis occurring in the aviation industry, it is a ``safety issue and it iswell within the purview of the FAA to develop a comprehensive, nationallyapplicable set of regulations.'' The Equal Employment Advisory Council(EEAC) believes that the workplace is an appropriate environment to intervenein the process of individual substance abuse. EEAC also believes that theFAA has correctly concluded that the purpose of drug testing is not todetermine that an employee is impaired by drugs at the time of testing.Instead, testing is used to enable an employer rationally to determineif an employee has used drugs and to conclude reasonably that there isa possibility of future impairment based on subsequent use. <T3>Comments that the Proposed Rules are Politically-Motivated.</T3> TheFAA received many comments that state that the comprehensive anti-drugprogram proposed by the FAA is based solely on political perceptions andgoals. The commenters stress that DOT and the FAA have surrendered to thepublic hysteria over drug use and unfavorable press reports of drug usein the aviation industry. <T3>FAA Response.</T3> Because this issue is raised so frequently by thecommenters, the FAA chooses to address these comments although they arebeyond the scope of the rulemaking. The war against drugs is one of thisAdministration's top priorities. Also, Congress has enacted a substantialamount of legislation to address the use, distribution, importation, andinterdiction of drugs in the United States and is considering enactmentof additional legislation. Moreover, a significant number of public opinionpolls indicate that the American public is deeply concerned about the effectof drug use by individuals in critical safety occupations, including aviation.The fact that the Administration, Congress, and the public are concernedabout drug use is noteworthy. However, the FAA is issuing the comprehensiveanti-drug program in this final rule because it is consistent with theFAA's statutory duty to promulgate minimum standards to ensure and promoteaviation safety. <T3>DHHS Guidelines.</T3> The FAA received numerous comments, includingcomments from drug testing laboratories and companies supplying drug testingequipment, on the guidelines for drug testing promulgated by the Departmentof Health and Human Services (DHHS). Many of the commenters state thatthe certification requirements for drug testing laboratories are too rigidbecause the DHHS guidelines require laboratories to have the capabilityto do both initial and confirmation testing at the same laboratory site.The Director of the Santa Maria Public Airport District and PsychemedicsCorporation, a commenter at the San Francisco public hearing, suggest thatthe FAA use analysis of hair, in lieu of urinalysis testing, to test fordrugs on the basis that hair analysis may be more accurate and more reliable.Psychemedics Corporation proposes that analysis of hair samples would producemore complete results because hair contains a ``longitudinal'' historyof drug use that could reveal drug use in excess of 90 days before analysis.This commenter also notes that the two-step process of immunoassay andGC/MS analysis would still be used; the only change would be the materialthat was analyzed. Federal Express strongly opposes implementation of theDHHS guidelines because they are overly-burdensome on carriers with operationsin multiple locations.Some commenters also state that a split sample should be obtained fromeach individual in order to ensure the accuracy of the analysis. Severalcommenters raise the issue that specimens may be used by an employer totest for physiological states, including epilepsy and pregnancy, to discriminateagainst applicants and employees. A few commenters consider the requirementof ``monitored'' specimen collection, whether by listening to or directlyobserving an individual, to be embarrassing and intrusive.The AMA opposes the proposal to require employers to comply with the DHHSguidelines. The AMA states that these requirements would result in an unduehardship on aviation medical examiners who must comply with chain-of-custodyprocedures designed to ensure the integrity of the specimen.The NTSB strongly concurs in the requirement that drug testing laboratoriesthat analyze specimens pursuant to the drug testing program must meet thescientific and technical DHHS guidelines and must be certified by the Departmentof Health and Human Services. Insofar as the DHHS guidelines are inconsistentwith other NTSB comments, the NTSB recommends that the FAA revise the guidelinesfor the industry drug testing program. ATA agrees that only DHHS-approvedlabs should be used for analyzing specimens but that the DHHS guidelinesshould be tailored to accommodate the particular needs of the aviationindustry.The SYVA Company and Drug Screening Systems, Inc. submitted comments tothe FAA on the DHHS guidelines. Both companies are involved in the manufactureand supply of drug screening systems and equipment. These companies urgecaution in the FAA's proposal to adopt the DHHS guidelines based on therestrictive and possibly burdensome nature of the requirements on employersrequired to conduct drug tests pursuant to the rule. These companies addressseveral issues, including batch requirements, on-site collection, thresholddrug levels, and development of new testing procedures not permitted underthe current DHHS guidelines.IFFA feels strongly that the Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique (EMIT)test should not be used as part of laboratory analysis of specimens becausethe test detects only the presence of a drug metabolite of the active drugand it often results in false-positive results, false-negative results,or misidentified results.ALPA generally supports the proposal to make the DHHS guidelines applicableto collection and analysis of specimens. However, ALPA believes that theFAA's regulation should contain additional employee safeguards. First,the regulation should require split samples during collection. Second,the regulation should require that threshold drug levels determined bya confirmation test be consistent with the initial test to account forquantitative discrepancies in test results that are not attributable todeterioration of the sample. Third, ALPA suggests that an employee shouldbe able to present the results of an independent test result to an MROduring review of test results to determine the validity of a positive testresult. Fourth, the regulation should allow labor and management, throughcollective bargaining, to inspect laboratories and to perform quality controland administrative functions related to any anti-drug program.Labor unions, including TWU and the Teamsters Union, advocate developmentand implementation of separate or additional guidelines to safeguard theselection and performance of laboratories analyzing specimens for drugsor drug metabolites.EEAC believes that the DHHS guidelines are a valuable contribution to thegoal of establishing procedural norms in collection and testing of specimens.However, EEAC believes that employers should establish individual proceduresto ensure the integrity of a sample and its analysis. EEAC emphasizes thatit is inappropriate for the FAA to impose such detailed requirements onprivate employers.<T3>FAA Response.</T3> In the NPRM, the FAA proposed that all collectionof specimens and drug testing take place in accordance with the ``MandatoryGuidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' published by theDepartment of Health and Human Services (53 FR 11970; April 11, 1988).The DHHS guidelines describe the collection and testing procedures applicableto all drug testing in the Federal government, and they include safeguardsfor the accuracy and privacy of collection and testing.The Department of Transportation has determined that certain modificationsof the DHHS guidelines are appropriate in the context of this and otherDOT-operating administration drug-free workplace regulations. The resultwill be the DOT ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug TestingPrograms,'' which will be codified at 49 CFR Part 40. These DOT proceduresare intended to preserve, to the greatest extent practicable, the importantsafeguards provided by the DHHS guidelines. Some of the modifications to the DHHS guidelines will be editorial in nature(e.g., references to responsibilities of ``agencies'' are changed to referencesto ``employers''). Other modifications are intended to take into accountdifferences in the situations of Federal agencies and DOT-regulated industries.For example, in testing at remote sites, DOT-regulated industries may findit necessary to conduct some kinds of testing in medical facilities orthrough the use of mobile units, rather than the more permanent collectionsites contemplated by the DHHS guidelines. It may not be practicable forregulated employers to maintain on-site permanent logbooks. Consequently,the DOT procedures would permit alternative collection and recordkeepingprocedures in these circumstances. The Office of the Secretary in the Department of Transportation will publishelsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>an interim final rule with request for commentsentitled, ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs,''that will codify the Department of Health and Human Services guidelinesfor drug testing at 49 CFR Part 40. This new part will set forth requirementsfor such things as specimen collection procedures, laboratory procedures,and quality assurance and certification procedures. The rule will provideguidance on how this rule shall be implemented. During the comment period on the FAA's NPRM, and those rules proposed byother DOT operating administrations, comments were received concerningthe DHHS guidelines. These comments are noted in this preamble and alsowill be transferred to the Department of Transportation to be incorporatedin the docket for the Office of the Secretary (OST) interim final rulecreating 49 CFR Part 40. OST will respond to those comments, as well ascomments received during the comment period for Part 40, in its noticefollowing the end of that comment period. The FAA proposed only urine testing in the proposals contained in the NPRM.The suggestion of drug testing using analysis of hair specimens raisesan issue within the expertise of the Department of Health and Human Services.Thus, at this time, DOT and the FAA do not intend to deviate from urinalysisas the technique for determining the presence of drugs or drug metabolitiesin an employee's system. The FAA acknowledges the AMA comments regarding the inability of all aviationmedical examiners to comply with the collection and chain-of-custody procedurescontained in the DHHS guidelines due to the lack of appropriate facilitiesfor collection. The FAA does not agree with the AMA that the requirementsare overwhelming or overly-burdensome. Although the AMA was not specificregarding its objection to the collection and chain-of-custody procedures,DOT has included provisions in the DOT procedures to address some of thedifficulties associated with collection and chain-of-custody proceduresthat may not have been appropriate for private entities. However, the FAAand DOT believe that strict collection and chain-of-custody proceduresare critical to ensure the integrity and identity of a specimen providedby an employee. Thus, DOT has retained these protections in its modificationof the DHHS guidelines. Moreover, only those aviation medical examinerswho choose to provide this service to commercial aviation personnel duringa physical examination are required to conform to the minimum procedurescontained in the DOT procedures.  Consistent with the suggestion of the NTSB and other commenters, the Departmentof Transportation will modify the DHHS guidelines to tailor the provisionsfor application by private entities. The DOT procedures will not modifythe basic, technological aspects of the rule (e.g., DHHS certificationof laboratories, testing methodologies, collection procedures, and chain-of-custodyprocedures). Any arguably substantive changes from the DHHS guidelineswill be included only to reduce practical and administrative burdens onprivate entities. These changes will be discussed in an ancillary documentpublished by the Department of Transportation in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>DOT and the FAA believe that the DOT procedureswill provide adequate and appropriate procedures for collection and testingof samples. Although the FAA anticipates that the DOT procedures will proveto be an effective and efficient method of collection and testing, experienceunder the testing program or a change in the circumstances or needs ofthe industry may warrant further regulatory revisions in the future. <T3>Accuracy of Drug Test Results. </T3>Many commenters base their oppositionto drug testing on the perceived inaccuracy of analysis and test results.The commenters include the issues of false-positive test results, passiveinhalation of illicit drugs, misidentification of licit drugs, and ingestionof food substances, including poppy seeds, resulting in a positive drugtest result. <T3>FAA Response. </T3>The FAA is aware of these expressed concerns becauseeach of these issues surfaced in the early 1980s with the first seriesof drug testing programs introduced in the military and the private sector.In the early years of drug testing and analysis, laboratory security andanalytical procedures had not reached today's level of sophistication.False-positive test results occur primarily in analysis of a specimen duringan initial screening test, although contemporary screening tests, suchas immunoassay tests, have become extremely accurate and approach 99 percentaccuracy levels. Despite its increased accuracy, the initial screeningtest remains a less expensive test used only to yield a preliminary indicationof the possible presence of drugs or drug metabolites. In order to ensurethe integrity and accuracy of any test result, each positive initial screeningtest result must be confirmed using GC/MS analysis or another confirmatoryprocedure that may be subsequently approved by DHHS and incorporated intothe DOT procedures. The GC/MS confirmation test is an extremely accurateand sophisticated test and is virtually error-free when used in compliancewith the DHHS guidelines. The DOT ``Procedures for Transportation WorkplaceDrug Testing Programs'' (49 CFR Part 40), will be essentially identicalto the ``Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs''published by the Department of Health and Human Services on April 11, 1988.Employers must comply with the DOT procedures when conducting a testingprogram pursuant to the final rule. Like the DHHS guidelines, the DOT procedureswill provide a system of checks and balances during collection and analysisof specimens. This system ensures the integrity and accuracy of the testsusing appropriate scientific methods and rigid chain-of-custody procedures.An employer may only use a laboratory that complies with the DOT procedures.Also, an employer may only use a laboratory that has been certified byDHHS to process and analyze specimens required by the FAA rule. The DOTprocedures regarding testing methodologies and technical matters will beidentical to the DHHS guidelines. Thus, employers will be able to use anyDHHS-certified laboratory since the laboratories will not necessarily berequired to use different analytical techniques and testing methodologiesfor different entities conducting testing. The Department of Transportationexpects that sufficient laboratories will have been certified for druganalysis by the Department of Health and Human Services by early 1989.However, the FAA will extend the compliance dates contained in this finalrule if DHHS has not certified a sufficient number of laboratories to efficientlyand accurately process and analyze specimens pursuant to the requirementsof this final rule. Since the mid-1980s, laboratories have become increasingly sophisticatedin their analytical methods and chain-of-custody procedures. Many laboratorieshave compiled extensive records demonstrating scientific accuracy and protectionof individual specimens. For example, CompuChem Laboratories, a major drugtesting laboratory, has analyzed over 500,000 urine samples, conductingdiscrete testing for nine different drugs which resulted in nearly fivemillion distinct analyses of these specimens, since 1980. CompuChem alsohas analyzed approximately 750,000 urine samples for the presence of twodifferent drugs, resulting in nearly 1.5 million analyses of these specimens,pursuant to its contract with the military. None of the over six millionanalyses performed for DOT, the military, and other private and publicentities has resulted in a false-positive test result. In late 1987, a CompuChem clerical worker incorrectly labeled two samplesthat belonged to DOT employees. Within hours after the test results werequestioned by the medical review officer, CompuChem and the medical reviewofficer had identified and corrected the error. CompuChem was not satisfiedwith its prompt resolution of the error. As stated in its comment to theNPRM, CompuChem has instituted an additional system of review, by CompuChempersonnel and computer checks, to ensure that ``* * * this one in a millionerror will not reoccur.'' Another drug testing firm, PharmChem Laboratories, has conducted over eightmillion nonmilitary drug tests nationwide. In its statement to the FAAduring the public hearing held in San Francisco on June 9, 1988, PharmChemnotes that several courts have determined that the GC/MS confirmation testis ``virtually 100 percent accurate, assuming that proper chain-of-custodyprocedures are followed.'' The FAA does not believe that the issue of ``passive inhalation'' of marijuanasmoke will prove to be a significant issue leading to false-positive testresults. First, PharmChem's statement indicates that the DHHS thresholdlevels that would result in a positive drug test result for the presenceof marijuana or marijuana metabolites (to be incorporated completely andwithout change in the DOT procedures) are set at a level sufficiently highto preclude the possibility of a positive test result based on passiveinhalation of marijuana smoke. Second, studies conducted to simulate theconditions that result in passive inhalation have been conducted in artificially-devisedand extremely confining areas that were poorly ventilated. Also, in orderto obtain a positive test result, testing was conducted immediately afterthis prolonged and intensive exposure to the marijuana smoke. Based onthe FAA's knowledge of these studies, the FAA has concluded that it ishighly unlikely that the identical circumstances would be encountered oraccurately reproduced outside a laboratory. Finally, the FAA believes that the safeguards that will be provided inthe DOT procedures and by the medical review officer (MRO) review process,which are essentially identical to the DHHS guidelines, will preclude misidentificationof food substances or licit drugs that might produce a false-positive testresult. The DOT procedures will provide an individual with an opportunityto report any legal or prescription drugs that he or she may be takingat the time of collection of the specimen. The MRO's broad authority tointerpret each confirmed positive test result, to evaluate an employeebased on the MRO's knowledge of drug abuse disorders, and to verify thata confirmed positive test result is accurate should preclude misidentificationof food substances or licit drugs taken in accordance with a valid prescription.In summary, the FAA believes that the two-step testing process, coupledwith the DOT procedures, provides a process by which an individual is protectedfrom erroneous false-positive drug test results. <T3>Preemployment Testing. </T3>Most organizations and individuals do notobject to the concept of preemployment testing. AOPA supports preemploymenttesting at the discretion of the employer. Operators who hire pilots orcrewmembers pursuant to short-term contracts believe that a preemploymenttest is burdensome if required each time a pilot is rehired pursuant toa new contract. These entities suggest that preemployment tests be givenonly at the time of training or placement on a bid list for contracts.Suburban Airlines has required preemployment testing of all flight crewapplicants for over a year. Suburban supports 100 percent preemploymenttesting of the aviation employees proposed in the NPRM. The Director ofthe Santa Maria Public Airport District also supports preemployment testingand suggests that preemployment testing be implemented immediately. The Soaring Society of America (SSA) believes that small business employersshould have the option of requiring preemployment drug testing as a conditionof employment. SSA feels that preemployment testing should be optionalbecause applicants can circumvent detection in a preemployment drug testmerely by abstaining from drug use for a short period of time before thepreemployment test. <T3>FAA Response. </T3>The FAA believes that preemployment testing is anecessary component of an effective anti-drug program. Pursuant to therule, a preemployment drug test is required only when an applicant hasbeen selected for employment in a sensitive safety- or security-relatedposition with the employer. The preemployment testing provision does notrequire an employer to test each applicant for a sensitive safety- or security-relatedposition. The rule simply states that an employer may not hire an applicantto perform sensitive safety- or security-related functions unless the applicanthas passed a drug test. Therefore, the employer need only test an applicantbefore actually hiring the applicant for a sensitive safety- or security-relatedposition.The FAA has revised the proposed rules in ways which should ease the burdenon operators who frequently rehire employees pursuant to short-term contracts.The FAA believes that the central issue regarding the frequency of preemploymenttesting is the continuity of an employee's involvement in an employer'sdrug testing program. An employer is required to conduct a preemploymenttest only the first time that an employee is hired pursuant to a contractwith that employer so long as the individual remains in the employer'sprogram, even during periods between contracts. The individual, thus, wouldbe subject continuously to drug testing. In addition, so long as an employeeis subject to an FAA-approved anti-drug program, another employer may usethat employee to perform sensitive safety- or security-related functions.Thus, an individual who participates through a consortium would be ableto provide services on a contract basis to multiple employers without havingto submit to subsequent preemployment tests or to participate in anotheremployer's drug testing program. If an employee has not been continuouslysubject to an FAA-approved anti-drug program, an employer would be requiredto conduct a preemployment drug test. In the FAA's opinion, it would be permissible for an employer to allowa contract employee to continue in the employer's anti-drug program aftertermination of a contract. Particularly in the case of an employer whohires employees pursuant to a series of short-term contracts, both theemployer and the employee benefit if the employee is continuously subjectto a drug testing program. The employer could ``rehire'' the employee atany time but would not be required to give the employee another preemploymentdrug test. In addition, the employee could perform sensitive safety- orsecurity-related functions for another employer on a temporary basis butwould not be required to participate in another employer's anti-drug programor to submit to another preemployment drug test. To the extent that theemployee is not covered by an FAA-approved anti-drug program, an employerwould be required to conduct a preemployment drug test before the employeecould be hired by a subsequent employer or rehired by a previous employer.<T3>Periodic Testing. </T3>AOPA believes that periodic drug testing shouldnot be part of an employer's drug testing program but should only be conductedbased on the reasoned judgment of an aviation medical examiner. RAA supportsperiodic testing during medical certification at least once each calendaryear. RAA believes that the employee should bear the cost of the periodictest. Federal Express does not oppose periodic testing but believes thatit should be unrelated to the FAA medical examination. The AMA opposes periodic drug tests as part of a routine medical examinationbecause compliance with collection and chain-of-custody procedures, suchas those contained in the DOT procedures and the DHHS guidelines, wouldbe an undue burden on aviation medical examiners. ATA stated that its association is not convinced that periodic testingeffectively deters illicit drug use because of the relative ease with whichthis test can be circumvented by abstinence. SSA generally does not endorseperiodic testing because an employee can avoid detection by relativelyshort-lived abstinence before any announced periodic test. <T3>FAA Response. </T3>The FAA agrees with the commenters that announcedperiodic testing can be circumvented by an employee's abstinence from druguse. However, periodic testing does enable an employer to identify thoseemployees who are so heavily-dependent on drugs that they are unable toabstain from drug use for even a short period of time prior to a periodictest. The FAA has modified the periodic testing requirement of the regulation.Under the proposed regulation, an employee who holds a medical certificatewould have been required to submit a specimen for drug testing as partof each medical examination required pursuant to Part 67. The revised sectionmakes it clear that an individual is required to submit a specimen fordrug testing during the first medical examination of the employee duringthe calendar year after implementation of the anti-drug program. Therefore,pilots who hold Class I medical certificates, who are required to haveperiodic medical examinations at 6-month intervals, must be tested onlyonce during one of the medical examinations of the year pursuant to theanti-drug program. The revised section also states that an employer may discontinue periodictesting after the first year of program implementation when the employerhas implemented its random testing program according to the implementationschedule and, therefore, is conducting a significant number of random tests.The periodic testing requirement will ensure that all current employeeswho hold medical certificates will be tested once during the first yearof implementation of an employer's anti-drug program; most of the employeeswho hold medical certificates also will be subject to random selectionfor testing during part of the first year of implementation. The majorityof random testing programs will be operational after the first year ofimplementation and periodic testing, which is less effective than randomtesting, will no longer be a necessary component of an employer's anti-drugprogram. The FAA anticipates that these revisions will provide maximumdrug detection capability and ease the transition to a full random testingprogram. The FAA considers the revision to be appropriate to relieve someof the significant economic and administrative burdens noted by the commenterswho believe that periodic testing is an ineffective and ineffective drugdeterrent. <T3>Random Testing. </T3>Most individual commenters oppose random testingfor a variety of reasons. Among these reasons is the lack of evidence ofdrug use or abuse in aviation to warrant random testing, invasion of individualprivacy, and violation of constitutionally-protected rights. AOPA opposes random testing primarily on the basis of the unsettled constitutionalissues surrounding random testing and the burden imposed by this testingmethod on law abiding citizens. AOPA suggests that the FAA delay promulgationof a final rule until the issues raised by random testing are substantiallyresolved by the Supreme Court in <T3>Railway Labor Executives' Association </T3>v. <T3>Burnley </T3>and <T3>National Treasury Employees Union v. von Raab </T3>(cited previously).AOPA states that, by awaiting any Supreme Court decision, the FAA couldensure that the final rule is in conformity with guidance enunciated inthe Supreme Court's opinion in <T3>Burnley </T3>and <T3>von Raab. </T3>One commenter submitted comments individually, as nationallitigation counsel for AOPA, and on behalf of the California Aviation Counciland the Orange County Aviation Association. This commenter states thatthe NPRM is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy and a violation ofan individual's procedural due process rights. The commenter believes thatthe NPRM should be withdrawn to await the Supreme Court's impending decisions.The AMA supported random testing only as part of a comprehensive rehabilitationprogram. The AMA believes that random testing is not cost effective, isunnecessarily intrusive, and, without confirmation testing, random screeningtests are inaccurate.In addition to soliciting comments on the general concept of random testing,the FAA solicited comments on an appropriate random testing rate of upto 125 percent. Several small business entities, including TEMSCO Helicopters,Inc., Henson Airlines, and Tramco, Inc., oppose the random testing requirementbased on the financial and administrative burdens associated with a 125percent testing rate, transportation of employees to the collection site,and replacement of personnel during testing. TEMSCO Helicopters suggeststhat a random testing rate of 10 percent will enable the industry to determineif there is a drug problem in aviation without overburdening the industry.RAA also believes that a 125 percent random testing rate is overreachingand unwarranted; however, if the FAA proceeds with a random testing provision,RAA suggests that a 50 percent random testing rate is appropriate. AlthoughSuburban Airlines strongly supports random testing, Suburban believes thata 50 percent random testing rate of the employees proposed in the NPRMwould relieve the unjustifiable economic burden on a cost-benefit basis.ERA Aviation, Inc., a Part 121 and Part 135 certificate holder operatingmore than 12 helicopters and 12 airplanes, believes that unannounced randomtesting is the most effective deterrent to drug abuse. However, ERA questionsa requirement to randomly test 125 percent of the employees on an annualbasis. ERA believes that random testing of 25 percent to 50 percent ofthe affected employee groups, coupled with periodic testing, would providea sufficient deterrent to drug use if the penalties for positive test resultswere severe.NTSB opposes the random testing requirement of the proposed rules. However,if random testing were included in the final rule, the NTSB believes thata relatively high random testing rate would be a more effective deterrentto drug use. The acting Chairman of the NTSB did not concur with the NTSB'sposition regarding random testing; the acting Chairman supports randomtesting provided that the random testing rate is sufficiently high to serveas a deterrent to drug use.ATA, American Airlines, and Delta Airlines support the FAA's mandatoryrandom testing provision because it would provide the maximum deterrenteffect to illicit drug use. ATA supports a random testing rate of 50 percentbased on a review of Department of Defense and private industry drug testingprograms. American Airlines also supports the mandatory random testingprovision and a 125 percent random testing rate. A consultant to AmericanAirlines on the issue of drug abuse prevention in the workplace, who submittedan affidavit attached to comments by American Airlines, is convinced thatrandom drug testing is ``the only powerful and proven means of detectingdrug use and drastically reducing drug use and thereafter preventing furtherdrug problems from occurring.'' On the other hand, Federal Express statesthat random testing should be permitted, but not mandated, by regulation.Federal Express states that if the FAA ultimately mandates random testing,carriers should be allowed to choose a random testing rate between 15 percentto 50 percent. Federal Express also believes that carriers should be freeto set different random testing rates for different groups of employees.There was almost universal opposition to random testing by unions and organizationsrepresenting employees. ALPA, the Transport Workers Union of American (TWU),and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Teamsters Union) are adamantlyopposed to random testing. ALPA (Council andplusmin;12) concurs in ALPA'sgeneral opposition to random drug testing of professionals in the aviationindustry. The Teamsters Union states that a drug testing program is a changein working conditions which, in accordance with Federal labor law, is amandatory subject of collective bargaining.SSA does not oppose random testing of employees. However, in order to providea workable and effective anti-drug program for small business, SSA suggeststhat entities employing 12 or fewer full-time employees be exempted fromthe random testing requirement. SSA defines ``full-time employees'' asthose individuals who work for an employer at least 30 hours per week or5 days per week and have maintained that schedule for at least 90 days.One commenter, who spoke at the San Francisco public hearing on June 9,1988, has been a practicing physician for 24 years and has devoted thepast seven years to the exclusive practice of aviation medicine. This commenterhas worked regularly with EAP representatives and has been involved with``* * * hundreds of airline employees before, during and after treatmentfor drug and alcohol dependencies.'' Based on the commenter's extensiveexperience in drug and alcohol use by aviation employees, he observes thatthe present system of relying on ``* * * peer and supervisory identification,and a highly visible employee assistance program,'' and on a scheme of``preemployment, for-cause and fitness-for-duty drug testing, enables significantlyimpaired employees to remain in the workforce.'' Therefore, this commenterconcludes that in order to eliminate those remaining risks, ``* * * thereis nothing more we can do short of random testing.''<T3>FAA Response. </T3>While noting the constitutional issues surroundingthe issue of random testing discussed previously, the FAA continues tobelieve that unannounced testing based on random selection is a fundamentalcomponent of an effective drug testing program. Unannounced, random testinghas proven to be an effective deterrent to drug use and will provide safetybenefits to the aviation community by reducing or eliminating drug useby sensitive safety- or security-related aviation personnel. Unannounced,random testing programs initiated by the military, including the CoastGuard, and private industry show declining drug use, evidenced by a decreasein the number of individuals who test positive for drugs, over the courseof the drug testing program.The FAA received many comments regarding the proposed random testing rates.Several commenters suggest a random testing rate of 125 percent becausethat rate would result in the most significant deterrent to drug use inthe aviation industry. However, other commenters who address this issuebelieve that a 125 percent random testing rate would be excessive and wouldimpose a significant economic burden, particularly on small aviation businesses.The commenters propose a range of random testing rates starting at 10 percentannually. The majority of the commenters suggest that an annual 50 percentrandom testing rate for the aviation industry is appropriate. These commentersbelieve that the 50 percent testing rate accomplishes several goals consistentwith the intent of the proposal.In response to the commenters, the FAA has substantially revised the randomtesting proposal in the NPRM in order to reduce the practical and administrativeburdens associated with initiating an unannounced testing program basedon random selection of employees. The FAA's approach also is designed toprovide a random testing rate that balances cost effectiveness and burdenson employees and employers but still results in an effective and credibledeterrent to drug use.For some employers, particularly those with a large number of employeessubject to drug testing, it may be a substantial burden to move from norandom drug testing of employees directly to random testing of 50 percentof the covered employees. For example, if required to have tested 50 percentof all covered employees by the end of the first year, employers mighthave to test at rates far above a 50 percent rate toward the end of theyear, to make up for lower rates at the beginning of the year. Employersshould be permitted to start the program at a lower testing rate and workup to a 50 percent rate as experience is gained and the testing procedurebecomes administratively routine. The FAA does not want to create a situationwhich might lead to inadvertent mistakes by requiring initial unannouncedtesting based on random selection at too high a rate.The final rule, therefore, provides an implementation procedure that wouldallow employers to phase in unannounced drug testing based on random selectionof employees during the first 12 months in which tests are required tobe conducted. Employers would not be required to reach an annualized rateof 50 percent until the last test collection of the first year of the program.The total number of unannounced tests based on random selection of employeesduring the first 12 months of the employer's testing program would haveto equal at least 25 percent of the covered employee population. Also,the employer is required to space the tests reasonably throughout the year.This approach will provide a sufficient level of deterrence to drug useand will permit the employer to phase in the 50 percent rate.Suppose, for example, that an employer has 1000 sensitive safety- or security-relatedemployees. At a 50 percent annual rate, the employer would be requiredto conduct 500 unannounced tests based on random selection during a year.Under the phased approach, however, the employer could conduct only a fewdrug tests at the beginning of the program and then gradually increasethe number of tests until, by the end of the first year, the annualizedrate of 50 percent was achieved. Thus, if the employer's drug testing plancontemplated administration of unannounced tests based on random selectionon 12 occasions during the year, the employer would need to collect 42urine specimens for analysis (500 divided by 12) on the last occasion,but could collect fewer specimens until then. Overall, the employer wouldhave to collect at least 250 specimens for analysis during the first year.In subsequent years, the employer is required to maintain the 50 percentannualized rate for unannounced testing based on random selection of employees.The FAA believes that the final rule provides a moderate, but substantial,level of testing based on random selection that enables an employer toincrease random testing gradually during the first year of program implementation.During subsequent years of the program, the employer must maintain an annualizedrate of 50 percent of the covered employees. In order to determine theappropriate number of employees that must be tested to reach the appropriate``annualized rate'' for the random testing program, the employer shallrefer to the number of employees subject to the rule at the beginning ofa calendar year.At this time, the FAA believes that this phased program, ultimately reachinga testing level equivalent to 50 percent of the covered employees, willprovide a sufficient deterrent to drug use without imposing an undue economicor administrative burden on employers and employees subject to the requirementsof the regulation. In addition, the program will produce a sufficient database at different annualized rates and testing levels for the FAA to analyzethe scope of any drug problem in the commercial aviation industry generallyor within any particular sector of the commercial aviation community. Analysisof the random drug testing data submitted by an employer will allow theFAA to determine if the random testing program should be revised in anymanner.The phased program and the final 50 percent random testing rate is consistentwith the random testing program currently applicable to safety- and security-sensitiveemployees of the Department of Transportation. DOT's random testing programbegan in September 1987; the random testing rate has gradually increasedand will reach an annualized rate of 50 percent by October of this year.Data from September 1987 to the present show that the current detectionrate found as a result of DOT's random drug testing program is 0.83 percent;data from February 1987 to the present show that the current detectionrate for FAA and DOT's periodic (e.g., scheduled) testing program is 0.012percent.According to the provisions of the final rule, all employers are requiredto randomly select a sufficient number of employees to enable the employerto conduct unannounced testing of employees who perform sensitive safety-or security-related duties for the employer at the appropriate rate duringthe calendar year. In order to conduct enough tests to reach the requiredpercentage, an employer may be required to select a number of employeeswho perform a sensitive safety- or security-related functions for unannouncedtesting that is in excess of the actual number to meet the required percentage.Selection of a greater number of employees enables the employer to reachthe appropriate annualized rate despite absences due to vacations and medicalleave or absences due to an inability to reach a collection site resultingfrom travel or duty requirements.If a consortium has been established among employers or operators, theconsortium would be required to select and to test the appropriate rateof the aggregate total of employees subject to the final rule who are coveredby the consortium. The testing rate of the consortium will be attributedto each employer participating in the consortium. In the FAA's opinion,the consortium's testing rate can be attributed to each participating employer,although less than the appropriate percentage of the employees of a particularemployer has been tested during a calendar year, without significantlydecreasing the deterrent effect of a random testing program. An employeror consortium that develops a random selection scheme involving preliminaryselection criteria, such as geographical zones, must specify these schemesor variations in the employer's anti-drug plan. The FAA realizes that thesevariations may provide administrative ease for an employer. However, theFAA must review these variations to ensure that the scheme does not dilutethe required annualized rate required by the final rule.The FAA received comments from small aviation businesses regarding thedifficulty of testing a large number of employees on a random basis duringthe first year of implementation of the rule. In response to these comments,the FAA substantially revised the provisions of the proposed rule. CertainPart 135 certificate holders whose total workforce includes 11 to 50 sensitivesafety- or security-related employees are given additional time to submita random testing plan and to ensure that the appropriate percentage ofthe sensitive safety- and security-related employees are subject to unannounceddrug testing on a random selection basis during a calendar year. The FAAencourages these employers to develop a comprehensive random testing planas soon as possible. As discussed later, Part 135 certificate holders thatemploy 10 or fewer covered employees and those individuals or entitieslisted in andSection;135.1(b), who are otherwise exempt from the requirementsof Part 135 but are included in the final rule because they are engagedin operations for compensation or hire, are given additional time to developand implement an anti-drug program that includes random testing. The FAAnotes that the final rule does not restrict the ability of these employersto submit a random testing program, and to implement that program, earlierthan the timeframes contained in the final rule.Some commenters address the issue of the difficulty in developing an efficientand successful random testing program. The FAA notes that the rule providesflexibility to an employer to begin the random testing program at a lowerrandom testing rate so long as the required percentage of covered employeeshave been selected on a random basis and have been tested by the end ofthe first year after approval of the employer's anti-drug program or randomtesting plan. For example, an employer may test small increments of employeesat the beginning of a period and may test a large percentage of employeesat the end of the same period to achieve the annualized rate that is requiredby the final rule.<T3>Postaccident Testing.</T3> AOPA supports postaccident testing if itis conducted by the NTSB. AOPA believes that postaccident testing shouldnot be a part of an employer's drug testing program and should not be conductedby the FAA.  The NTSB comments that the 24-hour period provided for postaccident testingis excessive. The NTSB recommends that the FAA specify a maximum periodof four hours for collection of a postaccident drug test and provide anappropriate penalty for failure to collect the specimen within the 4-hourperiod. The NTSB believes that delays of more than four hours in samplecollection impair detection of a drug and its ``psychoactive component(s)''in blood samples, particularly substances such as cocaine, marijuana metabolites,some amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP). The NTSB also suggests thatblood testing is the preferable method for postaccident testing and suggeststhat the FAA permit this method of testing for the presence of drugs afteran accident. ATA also suggests that postaccident testing should be conductedwithin 4 hours after an accident and, in no case, later than 12 hours afteran accident.  ATA recommended that the NTSB's definition of ``incident'' should be addedto the postaccident testing provision to cover situations when an aircraftis empty or when personal injury or physical damage is less severe thanspecified in the postaccident testing provision. ATA also believes thatpostaccident testing should be conducted unless a supervisor determinesthat an employee's drug use was not a contributing factor in the accident.FEIA believes that postaccident testing is ``wasteful and intrusive'' unlessthe accident clearly is caused by the person to be tested and there isindividualized probable cause to believe that the employee was impairedat the time of the accident.  SSA does not completely endorse postaccident testing based on a varietyof practical considerations that SSA believes are unresolved in the regulationas proposed. However, SSA states that postaccident testing, after an NSTB-definedaccident, of any employee working for a small business should be conductedas deemed feasible by the employer. SSA believes that postaccident testingshould be conducted within 24 hours if the employer determines that testingis feasible and appropriate. Also, if the employer determines that testingis not feasible, the FAA may request an explanation from the employer duringthe routine investigation of the accident.  <T3>FAA Response.</T3> In the NPRM, the FAA proposed that postaccidenttests be conducted within 24 hours after an accident based on the possibilitythat difficulties may arise after an accident in transporting an individualto a collection site or bringing a drug testing kit to the scene of theaccident. The FAA is aware that extended delays in sample collection andtesting after an accident may result in deterioration or elimination ofa drug or a drug metabolite from a person's system. Recognizing these difficultiesand concerns, the FAA has modified the postaccident testing provision.Under the final rule, an employer must conduct postaccident testing ofan employee as soon as possible after the accident but in no case laterthan 32 hours after the accident. Selection of this time period comportswith the DOT's postaccident drug testing program for DOT employees, whichprovides a maximum of 8 hours to determine if an employee is required tobe tested and an additional 24 hours to actually obtain a sample for testing. The FAA strongly encourages employers to promptly determine if an employeeis subject to postaccident testing, particularly in cases where there islittle or no uncertainty that an employee's performance was a contributingfactor in the accident. The FAA intends to vigorously enforce the regulationwhere there is unreasonable delay in determining whether an employee shouldbe tested under this provision or where there is unreasonable delay intesting after the determination to test is made. Although several commenterswho address the issue suggest time periods of less than 24 hours, it isthe FAA's opinion that a maximum period of 32 hours is a workable and reasonableaccommodation that is appropriate for the aviation industry.  The NTSB's suggestion that the FAA require an employer to conduct postaccidenttesting within four hours after an accident is based on the time-sensitivenature of toxicological testing of blood samples. On the other hand, urinalysistesting does not involve the extreme time-critical considerations associatedwith collection and testing of blood samples. In the FAA's opinion, postaccidenturinalysis testing is sufficient at this time to provide an indicationof an individual's drug use that may have been a causal factor in an aviationaccident.  Also, the FAA proposed only urine testing in the NPRM, specifically excludingblood testing as an option, for all drug tests that would be conductedunder the anti-drug program. Therefore, the FAA considers the NTSB's suggestionto be beyond the scope of the notice and the FAA has not adopted NTSB'ssuggestion to permit postaccident testing by collecting a blood sample.In the aviation context, the significant proportion of serious accidentsinvolving fatalities to crewmembers provides data with respect to druginvolvement in those accidents. In the FAA's judgment, extending full toxicologicaltesting to surviving crewmembers is not warranted at this time.  Presently, the FAA is not convinced that including the NTSB's definitionof ``incident'' as a trigger for drug testing is warranted. As discussedbelow, the FAA believes that the revisions to the section providing fortesting based on reasonable cause will adequately address circumstancesthat might qualify as ``incidents.'' The current provisions allow sufficient,but limited, latitude to an employer to determine whether an employee shouldbe tested following an incident or an accident not covered by the NTSB'sdefinition of accident.  Although several commenters suggest that the FAA expand the scope of thepostaccident testing provision, the FAA believes that the postaccidenttesting provision, limiting testing to only those employees whose performancemay have been a cause of the accident, is appropriate. The FAA believesthat it is inappropriate to require postaccident testing of an employeewhose performance could not have been a cause of the accident merely becausethat employee happens to have been onboard or involved with an aircraftinvolved in an accident.  <T3>Testing Based on Reasonable Cause.</T3> The NTSB suggested that theFAA include ``incidents,'' as defined by the NTSB's rules, as events thatwould trigger reasonable cause testing. RAA agrees with the requirementthat two supervisors, one with training in the symptoms of drug abuse,must concur in the decision to test an employee based on reasonable suspicionof drug use. RAA believes that each carrier should determine the conditionswhich constitute reasonable suspicion. FEIA also believes that two supervisors,trained to detect symptoms of drug abuse, must concur in all decisionsto test based on probable cause. ATA suggests that only one supervisorbe required to trigger testing of an employee based on reasonable cause.In addition, ATA states that supervisors should not be required to havespecialized training for the purpose of determining when reasonable causeexists to test an employee.  Tramco, Inc. believes that the proposed circumstances that would supporta decision to test based on reasonable cause are too restrictive. Tramcobelieves that an employee's attendance patterns, tips from coworkers, ``errorrates,'' and other indirectly observable indications should also triggertesting based on reasonable cause. Tramco currently uses these triggersin its drug testing program; Tramco believes that the FAA's criteria willnot result in detection of possible drug users because it is limited tophysical and observable indices of gross impairment. SSA supports ``for-cause''testing, as the employer deems necessary and feasible, if testing is conductedpursuant to the DHHS guidelines.  IAM and TWU believe that the criteria that would trigger testing basedon reasonable cause are ill-defined. These organizations believe that testingbased on reasonable cause will be a tool for employee harassment; theseorganizations suggest that supervisory personnel should be trained to recognizethe symptoms of drug impairment or that at least one of the supervisorsmaking the determination to test should be someone other than the employee'simmediate supervisor. The Teamsters Union and IAM believe that decisionsand determinations related to testing based on reasonable cause shouldbe documented and supported in a written report.  The Newton Psychological Centre submitted a ``basic identification profile,''developed to aid supervisors of the Philadelphia Electric Company in identificationof employees who may not be fit for duty. The profile is used to detectearly warning signs of problems based on medical or psychological problems.The profile sets forth behavioral, emotional, physical, biological, andcognitive cues related to the use of marijuana, cocaine, alcohol, barbiturates,amphetamines, and heroin, or cues related to anxiety or depression. Thecompany's policies regarding alcohol and substance abuse, job performancewarning signs, and counseling and confrontation guidelines are printedon the profile.  <T3>FAA Response.</T3> As stated in the FAA's response to comments submittedon the postaccident testing provision, the FAA is not including a ``postincident''testing provision at this time. However, the circumstances under whicha supervisor could require an employee to submit to a test based on reasonablecause have been modified in the final rule. Based on the comments submitted,particularly by employers who have existing ``reasonable cause'' testingprograms, the FAA has expanded the list of circumstances that might triggertesting under this provision. Evidence of repeated errors on the job, regulatoryor company rule violations, or unsatisfactory time and attendance patterns,if coupled with a specific, contemporaneous event that indicates probabledrug use, could provide additional, cumulative evidence to support a decisionto test an employee based on reasonable cause.  As proposed in the NPRM, an employer is permitted to test a specimen providedby an employee, collected pursuant to a reasonable cause determination,for the presence of any drug or drug metabolite listed in Schedule I orSchedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. The employer may test forthese drugs, as part of the employer's approved anti-drug program, if theemployer has specific approval from the FAA to include these controlledsubstances in the employer's anti-drug program. In addition, the testingfor these additional drugs must be conducted in accordance with the DOTprocedures to be codified in 49 CFR Part 40.  The FAA believes that the provision requiring two supervisors, one of whomhas specialized training in detecting the symptoms of drug use, to concurin the decision to test an employee based on reasonable cause is appropriatefor large companies. However, the FAA has revised this section of the rulein order to address the legitimate concerns of small employers, many ofwhom do not have more than one supervisor employed at the company. Forcompanies that employ 50 or fewer employees who perform a sensitive safety-or security-related function, the rule specifies that only one supervisoris required to make the determination that would trigger testing of anemployee based on reasonable cause. The FAA also has clarified the annualEAP training requirements for supervisors to make it clear that supervisorswho make reasonable cause determinations must have specific training thatwill enable them to assess and demonstrate the basis for testing basedon reasonable cause. <T3>Testing after Return to Duty. </T3>ATA believes that the FAA shouldnot set regulatory standards governing postrehabilitation testing. ATA,other employer and employee organizations, and many individual commentersbelieve that a schedule for postrehabilitation testing should be made bymanagement in consultation with persons involved in an employee's rehabilitationprogram. In order to ensure continued disassociation from drugs, RAA supportsa requirement for monthly screening, for 12 months, after an employee hascompleted rehabilitation. APFA believes that a schedule for postrehabilitation testing should bedetermined by an employee's EAP counselor and should be limited to a reasonableperiod of no more than one year. AFA states that decisions regarding testingafter rehabilitation should be the responsibility of the individual treatmentfacility used by the employee. <T3>FAA Response. </T3>The FAA agrees with the commenters that suggestthat unannounced testing during any rehabilitation and before an employeereturns to duty should be determined by the persons involved in the employee'srehabilitation program. Decisions regarding the frequency of testing duringany rehabilitation program appropriately lie with those individuals whoare familiar with and involved in any employee rehabilitation program.However, unannounced testing after an employee returns to duty is criticalto ensure an employee's continued disassociation from drugs. The FAA believesthat it is essential to require unannounced testing of employees who havereturned to duty in a sensitive safety- or security-related position foran employer after failing a drug test given by an employer or after refusingto submit to a drug test required by the final rule. This type of testingis the most effective means of ensuring that an employee remains drug freewhile performing commercial aviation duties. Moreover, once an employeehas returned to duty, the FAA and the employer have a substantial interestin requiring that employee to be drug free while performing sensitive safety-or security-related duties in commercial aviation. Therefore, the FAA hasincluded a provision in the rule requiring an employer to monitor an employeewho has returned to duty by providing unannounced drug testing, pursuantto a schedule determined by the MRO, for not more than 60 months afterthe employee has returned to duty. The rule also provides that an employer must conduct unannounced testingof an individual who is hired to perform a sensitive safety- or security-relatedfunction after failing a drug test or after refusing to submit to a drugtest for another employer and who has not previously been subject to return-to-dutytesting. This section of the final rule addresses situations where an individualfails a drug test or refuses to submit to a drug test but does not returnto duty for an employer. In this case, any subsequent employer would berequired to test an individual for not more than 60 months after the individualis hired to ensure that the individual is drug free. In the FAA's opinion,if an employee failed a drug test given by a previous employer but returnedto duty with that employer in accordance with the requirements of thisfinal rule, a subsequent employer would not be required to reevaluate aprior employer's return-to-duty decision. An employer would be requiredto test this individual prior to employment but would not be required tomonitor the employee after the employee was hired. Pursuant to the finalrule, the medical review officer (MRO) has the discretion to determinethe appropriate level of unannounced testing for an individual or an employee.The FAA believes that it is appropriate to allow the MRO to tailor thefrequency of this type of testing to adequately address differences betweenindividuals, the level and type of drug use, and any treatment or counselingprogram. The FAA notes that the MRO also is require to ensure that an employee hasbeen tested for drugs, in accordance with the procedures in the final ruleand the DOT procedures, before being hired or returning to duty. In mostcases, the MRO will not be required to arrange testing for an employeebecause the employee will have taken a drug test as part of any employeerehabilitation program. However, the MRO must ensure that an individualor employee has been tested, in accordance with the procedures of AppendixI to Part 121 and the DOT procedures, before the MRO can make a recommendationthat an individual be hired or than an employee be returned to duty afterfailing a drug test or after refusing to submit to a drug test. In theFAA's opinion, a preemployment drug test would suffice to satisfy thisrequirement of the final rule. <T3>Employee Assistance Programs and Rehabilitation. </T3>The FAA soughtcomment in the NPRM regarding three different EAP options. These optionsspecified the circumstances under which an employee would be given theopportunity to seek rehabilitation. Option 1 would allow all employeesto seek an opportunity for rehabilitation regardless of how the employee'sdrug use was detected. Option 2 would allow most employees, except thoseemployees whose drug use was detected as a result of postaccident testingor testing based on reasonable cause, to seek an opportunity for rehabilitation.Option 3 would only allow employees who volunteer to seek rehabilitationand would exclude all employees whose drug use was detected by any othermeans. Under all three options, an employer would not be required to offeran opportunity for rehabilitation or to provide job security to any employeewho was identified as a drug user on the job. Employer organizations tend to support the third option proposed in theNPRM regarding rehabilitation and reemployment or job security opportunitiesthat should be offered to employees. Part 121 certificate holders, as generallynoted by ATA, support the third option. For example, Delta Airlines believesthat the most effective deterrent to drug use is the threat of losing ajob. On that basis, Delta states that mandatory rehabilitation and an opportunityfor continued employment would diminish the effectiveness of the rule.American Airlines disagrees with ATA's position and supports the firstoption. Federal Express supports the third option if the FAA mandates rehabilitation.The Helicopter Association International (HAI) states that requiring anemployer-sponsored rehabilitation program whenever required testing ofan employee produces a positive drug test result places an unwarrantedburden on the employer. HAI believes that an employer should have the rightto dismiss an employee if any drug test conducted during employment producesa positive test result. HAI states that the employer should have the abilityto decide which employees, based on the ``value'' of the employee to theorganization, would be offered an opportunity for rehabilitation. Small Part 135 certificate holders generally state that an employer shouldhave the right to fire any employee who uses drugs and feel that an opportunityfor rehabilitation should not be offered to any employee who uses drugs.These small employers base their position on the potential liability tothe company of rehiring a known drug user, the expense to the company ofholding the employee's job open, or replacing an employee on a temporarybasis, during rehabilitation. The AMA reaffirmed its long-standing support of employment-based treatmentand assistance programs for employees with alcohol or drug problems. TheAMA believes that the FAA should require an employer to provide one opportunityfor rehabilitation to any employee who voluntarily enrolls in an EAP andto any employee who is identified as a drug user through testing.NTSB generally concurred in the concept of requiring an employer to provideEAP services to employees. The NTSB recommended that employers be requiredto offer one opportunity for rehabilitation to employees who volunteerfor an EAP and for employees who are identified as drug users through anytype of drug testing.Most small business entities, TEMSCO Helicopters, Inc. and Overseas AirTransport Corporation for example, object to a regulatory provision thatwould require an employer to provide job security to an individual enrolledin rehabilitation. This objection is based on the financial burden of keepinga job open for an employee who is unable to perform his or her duties andthe elimination of an employer's discretion to fire an employee who usesdrugs. RAA believes that an employee who has successfully completed rehabilitation,as determined by the head of the rehabilitation program and airline management,should be offered an opportunity to return to duty. Executive Air Fleet(EAF), a Part 135 certificate holder with 200 employees subject to testing,would support job security for an employee who voluntarily sought rehabilitationand who had three to five years of service with the company. SSA also believesthat an employee's length of employment may be a reasonable factor to considerwhen specifying an employer's obligation to retain or rehire an employeeparticipating in rehabilitation. SSA also states that holding an employee'sjob open during inpatient rehabilitation will greatly complicate smallbusiness operations for an unknown time period. Henson Airlines statesthat, under its existing program, employees will be fired as a result ofa positive alcohol or drug test. ERA Aviation, Inc. strongly objects toany Federally-mandated rehabilitation and rehire requirement. ERA Aviationobjects to the cost of providing EAP services, but more important, objectsto assuming the potential liability problems that could result from rehiringa known user of illegal substances even if that employee has successfullycompleted a rehabilitation program.Several small operators, including TEMSCO Helicopters, Inc., object tothe requirement to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation to employeesidentified as drug users. Henson Airlines provides an opportunity for rehabilitationonly to employees who voluntarily enroll in rehabilitation. RAA supportsthese views. Organizations such as the American Association of AirportExecutives (AAAE) and ATA believe that an opportunity should be offeredonly to employees who volunteer for rehabilitation. SSA states that thereshould be no requirement that a small business retain or rehire any employeewho tests positive for drugs as a result of any unplanned drug test, includingpostaccident or for-cause testing. ATA believes that limiting rehabilitationand reemployment to volunteers has the dual effect of making safety theindustry's highest priority and containing the costs associated with rehabilitation.AAAE believes that any employee who tests positive for drugs should bedismissed immediately. AAAE comments that employers and employees shouldbe free to negotiate broader rehabilitation and reemployment rights aspart of a collective bargaining agreement.Labor organizations are strong supporters of broad EAP opportunities andservices. TWU and FEIA believe that all employees who test positive, regardlessof the reason for testing, should be given at least one opportunity forrehabilitation. FEIA supports the requirement for at least one rehabilitationopportunity because a positive drug test is not proof of impairment onthe job. The Teamsters Union believes that negotiated, client-specificrehabilitation programs should be available to employees who volunteerand for employees who test positive on one occasion. Labor organizationscomment that all rehabilitation costs should be paid by the employer eitherdirectly or as part of an employee benefit or insurance package. TWU concurswith this position, insofar as it relates to the first positive test result,unless the employee has engaged in conduct that would otherwise justifysuspension or discharge under an applicable collective bargaining agreement.ALPA states that there is no valid reason to limit access to an EAP onlyto employees who volunteer for rehabilitation. Based on experience in theHIMS program, only 15 percent of the pilots treated for alcoholism wereself-referred; 85 percent of the pilots were discovered by the union ormanagement, or both. ALPA believes that rehabilitation should be made broadlyavailable to any employee who could benefit from an EAP and that, in somecases, a second opportunity for rehabilitation may be appropriate. ALPAurges the FAA to revise the proposed regulation to require employers topay the cost of rehabilitation programs that are mandated by the regulation.ALPA believes that traditional EAP techniques that are tailored to a specificpopulation, such as the HIMS program, will be more effective in deterringdrug use than the anti-drug program proposed in the NPRM. During the 15-yearperiod that the HIMS program has been in effect, 800 pilots have participatedin rehabilitation for alcoholism yielding a long-term success rate of 93percent. ALPA states that the average ``off line time'' for pilots involvedin the HIMS program is approximately 120 days: 30 days for treatment; 30days for aftercare treatment, observation, and processing; and 45 to 60days for processing of an FAA application. The recovery rate for pilotswho participate in one rehabilitation opportunity is 85 percent. Of the15 percent of the pilots who suffer a relapse after the first treatment,approximately 50 percent are successfully treated in their second rehabilitationopportunity.<T3>FAA Response. </T3>Most comments regarding rehabilitation deal withthe issue of whether, and under what circumstances, to offer rehabilitationand to provide job security to an employee and the length of any employeerehabilitation period. The FAA carefully considered the various argumentssubmitted by the commenters on the issue of EAP services and rehabilitationopportunities for employees. The FAA understands, and considered, the argumentsraised in defense of broad rehabilitation opportunities and job securityfor aviation personnel who use drugs.However, the FAA reviewed the two options that included provisions providingbroad rehabilitation opportunities and job security to employees whosedrug use was detected through testing under the final rule. Many of thecommenters oppose rehabilitation opportunities and job security for employeeswho fail to discontinue drug use and wait to be detected by testing. TheFAA agrees with these commenters and believes that a strong message mustbe conveyed to drug users that the use of drugs is unacceptable in theaviation industry. The FAA's primary duty, pursuant to statutory mandate,is to consider the adverse safety consequences surrounding the issue ofdrug use by senstivie safety- and security-related aviation personnel.On this basis, the FAA has determined that employers should not be obligatedto offer an opportunity for rehabilitation or to provide job security toemployees who fail a drug test or who use drugs on the job. The FAA understandsthat broad rehabilitation opportunities and job security for employees,without regard to the manner of detection of drug use, may help those employeeswho are unable to help themselves. But, the FAA believes that it is inconsistentwith the agency's safety responsibilities to promote the message that druguse in the aviation industry will be tolerated until an individual's druguse is detected through testing. The FAA believes that it is inappropriateto place the agency and an employer in the anomalous position of allowingany employee who uses illegal drugs to work in a sensitive safety- or security-relatedposition and whose drug use may adversely affect aviation safety. Rather,the FAA believes that it is appropriate and consistent with its statutorysafety mandate to prohibit an employee who fails a drug test, who refusesto submit to a drug test, or who uses drugs on the job from acting in asensitive safety- or security-related position. The FAA is convinced thatthe comprehensive testing program of sensitive safety- and security-relatedemployees, combined with an employee assistance program to educate andtrain all personnel, is consistent with the statutory duty to promote aviationsafety and will reduce any drug use in the aviation community.The FAA also carefully reviewed the third option presented in the NPRMthat would provide an opportunity for rehabilitation and job security toan employee who admitted his or her drug use and who volunteered for rehabilitationbefore being detected through drug testing. However, in the FAA's opinionand as noted by the commenters, there are several issues related to employeerehabilitation and retention or reemployment benefits that must be consideredin development of the final rule.For example, the term ``rehabilitation'' generally means the period oftime during which an employee is receiving treatment or counseling fora drug problem. The length of any rehabilitation period is dependent onseveral factors such as the availability and enrollment period of rehabilitationservices, the length and extent of treatment for the level of use and thetype of drug used, collection and analysis of tests given during rehabilitation,and the review process that may lead to a recommendation to return to dutyin a sensitive safety- or security-related position. The term ``rehabilitated''generally means that an employee is determined to be drug free and, basedon the employee's progress and prognosis during rehabilitation, the employeemay return to work. The fact that an employee has returned to work doesnot mean that the employee is exempt from follow-up or aftercare treatmentand counseling.The FAA is aware of the wide variety of rehabilitation programs that varyboth in the length of treatment and type of treatment depending on thesubstance used and the availability of rehabilitation and treatment services.One standard rehabilitation and treatment program, generally necessaryfor those individuals who require intensive inpatient care followed byoutpatient care and counseling sessions, specifies 28 days of inpatientcare. Other programs may involve shorter periods of time for inpatientcare, may involve outpatient treatment only, or may involve a combinationof inpatient and outpatient care of varied duration. For example, sometreatment programs may require three to four sessions, given on two orthree nights a week, over a six to eight week period and followed by lessfrequent meetings or counseling sessions. Other treatment programs mightinvolve individual or group counseling sessions on a weekly basis, overa period of one year or more. An additional factor that affects the lengthor treatment or rehabilitation is the availability of private or communityservices in a particular area.The FAA reviewed these variables to determine if a timeframe for voluntaryrehabilitation and job security could be developed and included in thefinal rule. The FAA carefully considered the comments from many aviationbusinesses that oppose any regulatory requirement to offer rehabilitationand to retain or rehire any employee who admits to illegal drug use. Thecommenters base their objections on several factors including eliminationof an employer's discretion to terminate an employee; undue complicationof operations due to potential extended absences of employees enrolledin rehabilitation; and negation of an employer's ability to tailor rehabilitationopportunities and job security to a particular employee population. Themost strenuous objections are based on the substantial and unwarrantedburdens, both administrative and financial, associated with rehabilitationand job security for employees. Based on financial information submittedby the commenters, it appears that expenses of rehabilitation and job securityopportunities as proposed would seriously affect large aviation entitiesand would probably overwhelm small companies.After review of the considerable variables in treatment and the extensivearguments presented by the commenters, the FAA concluded that a reasonableaccommodation of burdens on employers who may not be able to absorb employeeabsences and realistic opportunities for employee rehabilitation can notbe imposed in the abstract. Thus, the FAA does not agree with the commenterswho state that the FAA should specify an opportunity for rehabilitationand the amount of time during which an employer is required to providejob security for an employee enrolled in rehabilitation.Many employers in the aviation industry currently offer rehabilitationopportunities and job security benefits to employees. The FAA anticipatesthat those employers will continue to offer these opportunities and benefitsto employees and that other employers may elect to include these componentsin any negotiated employee benefit package. Because many aviation entitieshave resolved the relative administrative, personnel, operational, andfinancial issues that surround employee rehabilitation and job securityrequirements, the FAA believes that the aviation industry is able to designappropriate programs and services for its employees. The FAA believes that,in light of the variables and burdens addressed above, issues regardingan adequate amount of time for rehabilitation, an appropriate amount oftime to receive a recommendation to return to duty in a sensitive safety-or security-related position, and job security matters, are best addressedin the specific employment context.Thus, an employer is not required to offer an opportunity for rehabilitation,to provide job security, or to provide the resources for rehabilitationto any employee. At the same time, employers may offer these opportunitiesand benefits to employees; the FAA urges employers to consider the experienceof employers who have developed rehabilitation programs.The final rule does not prohibit an employer from reassigning an employeeto a position that does not involve the performance of sensitive safety-or security-related duties. The final rule also does not dictate whetheran employee is required or permitted to use vacation time, sick leave,or leave without pay in order to accommodate the employee's time away fromhis or her sensitive safety- or security-related position. The FAA believesthat issues such as termination, reassignment, hiring of temporary employeesto fill a position, or policies regarding an employee's absence from aposition, are issues that are appropriately the subject of employer andemployee negotiation or collective bargaining.The NPRM did not propose to require an employer to pay for an employee'srehabilitation and final rule also does not address this issue. Indeed,since an employer is permitted to terminate an employee who fails a drugtest or who refuses to submit to a drug test, and such employee does nothave a right to return to duty for that employer, this issue is not relevantto the final rule. However, the employer may cover an employee's rehabilitationexpenses through an employee benefit package, insurance coverage, or asa matter of collective bargaining negotiated between the employer and theemployee. The FAA considers these areas to be a matter between employersand employees and, as such, are left to the discretion of the employeror to be negotiated during collective bargaining.<T3>EAP Education and Training Programs.</T3> ATA states that the FAA shouldnot specify the details and contents of an employer's EAP. The TeamstersUnion believes EAP services should be negotiated between labor and managementand that rehabilitation programs should be client-specific.ALPA believes that EAP services should be tailored to be specific employeepopulation as the HIMS program is tailored to pilots in commercial aviation.Various labor organizations conclude that EAPs, instead of mandatory testing,are the preferable method to conduct an anti-drug program. AFA also urgesthe FAA to separate the administration of any drug testing programs, ifmandated at all, from administration of an EAP. The FAA received considerable data in response to the ANPRM and the NPRMregarding the availability of EAP services. Some of these commenters includedspecific, existing EAPs that are recommended by the industry. The Associationof Labor-Management Administrators and Consultants on Alcoholism, Inc.,(ALMACA) submitted an extensive, recommended industry EAP in response tothe ANPRM. Although most commenters think that EAPs are valuable, employer and employeeorganizations differ on the mechanics and content of an EAP education andtraining component. Labor unions generally favor broad EAP services. Themajority of employer organizations favor EAPs that are designed to meetthe specific needs of the company and oppose regulatory action by the FAAin this area. <T3>FAA Response. </T3>The FAA believes that an employer should have theability to design an EAP that would best serve its employees. The abilityto tailor an EAP is particularly important for small aviation employerswho may not have the financial and administrative resources to supporta company-sponsored EAP. Therefore, the FAA has made no changes to theproposed minimal EAP education requirements. However, the FAA has revisedthe EAP training requirements. The FAA deleted the minimum requirementof 60 minutes of annual training for all employees. The FAA retained the60-minute training requirement for supervisors who will make determinationsto test an employee based on reasonable cause. The FAA believes that itis appropriate to require a full 60 minutes of initial training for presently-employedand newly-hired supervisors making reasonable cause determinations becauseof the need for increased awarness and recognition of signs that may indicatedrug use. The employer has the discretion to determine the reasonable recurrenttraining for supervisory personnel who have the authority to make reasonablecause determinations. The FAA believes that this flexibility will enableemployers to address specific issues or needs that may arise as a resultof the employer's anti-drug program. The rule permits an employer to develop and provide these minimum servicesas part of an internal program or the employer may contract with communityagencies or other aviation companies to provide these services to employees.The employer is permitted to provide additional education and training,beyond the minimum requirements of the rule, to its employees. The FAAbelieves that employers will not have substantial difficulty developingeducation and training programs for employees because of the significantnumber of model EAPs submitted to the FAA in response to the ANPRM. <T3>Small Aviation Entities and Businesses. </T3>The National Air TransportAssociation (NATA) represents numerous Part 135 certificate holders inthe aviation industry. NATA states that the anti-drug program would havesignificant cost impact on Part 135 certificate holders and, particularly,small aviation operators. NATA recommends that Part 135 certificate holders,with 100 or fewer covered employees should be excluded from the requirementto submit and implement an anti-drug program. A number of other small Part135 certificate holders responding to the NPRM also argue for exclusionfrom the anti-drug program. AOPA urges the FAA to exempt from the rule operators and their employeeswho currently are exempt from the requirements of Part 135. AOPA contendsthat these operators are invariably small businesses who would be unableto withstand the financial and administrative burdens of the proposed regulations.Several commenters involved in single pilot_single aircraft operationsnoted the difficulty of complying with most of the provisions of the proposedrules. Atlantic Aero, Inc., a fixed based operation employing more than 100 people,and Sunwest Aviation support efforts to address the drug problem but statethat modifications to the proposal are necessary to avoid an unjustifiedadministrative and financial burden on small operators. SSA feels that the proposed anti-drug program is inappropriate for smallbusinesses that rely on student instruction as the economic base of activitiesor for certified flight instructors acting as independent contractors.SSA believes that the FAA has failed to account for the practical differencesbetween large corporate entities and small businesses. SSA suggests thatthe FAA develop four separate anti-drug programs that would address theparticular needs and concerns of Part 121 certificate holders, Part 135certificate holders, flight schools, and small businesses or independentcontractors. A commenter speaking as national litigation counsel for AOPA and on behalfof the California Aviation Council and the Orange County Aviation Association,conveys the concerns of flight instructors, small fixed base operators,banner towers, crop dusters, and other small aviation entities that donot provide scheduled air carrier service who are affected by the proposal.This commenter notes that the NPRM is an unwarranted, overreaching invasionof the domestic aviation community's right to be free from governmentalintrustion because of the lack of evidence of any drug problem among commercialaviation professionals. The commenter states that this lack of evidencesupports the history or responsible self-regulation by the commercial aviationcommunity. The National Association of Flight Instructors (NAFI) states that the anti-drugprogram proposed in the NPRM is tailored for a large aviation organizationand, therefore, is not appropriate for a small organization or a freelaneflight instructor that is not employed by any company. NAFI believes thattesting of a flight instructor each time that instructor performs flightinstruction duties will be impossible. In addition, NAFI is concerned aboutthe quality and reliability of laboratory analysis; the constitutionalityof drug testing; and the administrative and economic burden on small entitiesrelated to EAP services, MRO requirements, and job security for employeesenrolled in rehabilitation. Two individual commenters believe that sole-proprietorshipsand businesses that employ 10 or fewer employees should be excluded fromany requirement to implement an anti-drug program. <T3>FAA Response. </T3>The FAA understands the economic and practical concernsexpressed by Part 135 certificate holders as well as those entities orindividuals, listed in andSection; 135.1(b), who are otherwise exempt fromthe requirements of Part 135 but are affected by the regulation becausethey are engaged in operations for compensation or hire. For the purposesof the requirements of the anti-drug program, the FAA has tailored thefinal rule in an attempt to accommodate small aviation entities, particularlythose Part 135 certificate holders who employ 50 or fewer employees whoare covered by this final rule and those entities or individuals, listedby this final rule and those entities or individuals, listed in andSection;135.1(b), who are otherwise exempt from the requirements of Part 135 butare included in the comprehensive anti-drug program because they conductoperations for compensation or hire.The FAA believes that it would be counterproductive to the goals of theanti-drug program to impose requirements on small aviation entities whowould be unable to comply with them because of substantial financial, administrative,and logistical difficulties. The vast majority of the difficulties areassociated with the requirements of implementing a random testing programand providing rehabilitation programs and services to employees. Therefore,the FAA has revised the proposed rule to provide a tiered implementationplan that would allow small aviation entities to develop and implementa comprehensive anti-drug program, over specific time periods, in accordancewith a schedule determined by the FAA. The language of the rule does notprohibit an employer from implementing its anti-drug program sooner thanrequired by the FAA's schedule if the employer is able to comply with therule requirements and the provisions of its anti-drug program at an earlierdate.Part 121 certificate holders and Part 135 certificate holders that havemore than 50 covered employees, and contractors to these certificate holders,will be required to follow the schedule that was proposed in the NPRM withone exception. As proposed, these employers must submit an anti-drug planto the FAA not later than 120 days after the effective date of the ruleand must implement the anti-drug program not later than 180 days afterapproval of the anti-drug program by the FAA. However, these employersare required to implement preemployment testing of applicants for sensitivesafety- or security-related positions not later than 10 days after approvalof the employer's anti-drug plan by the FAA. The FAA believes that it isappropriate to require accelerated implementation of preemployment testingfor these employers because many of these employers have existing preemploymenttesting programs and, generally, these employers have the available financialand administrative resources that enable them to begin testing.Part 135 certificate holders that have 11 to 50 covered employees, andcontractors to those certificate holders, will be required to submit aninterim anti-drug program, that sets forth all required drug testing exceptmandatory random drug testing, not later than 180 days after the effectivedate of the final rule. The employer must implement preeployment testing,periodic testing, postaccident testing, testing based on reasonable cause,and testing after an employee's return to duty not later than 180 daysafter approval of the anti-drug program by the FAA. These employers mustsubmit an amendment of their interim anti-drug program to the FAA, thatcontains the procedures for implementing an unannounced testing programof employees who are randomly selected at the applicable annualized testingrate, not later than 120 days after approval of the interim anti-drug programby the FAA. The employer must continue implementation of the remainderof the program and must implement the random testing provision not laterthan 180 days after approval of the amended anti-drug program by the FAA.Part 135 certificate holders with 10 or fewer covered employees and thoseentities or individuals, listed in andSection; 135.1(b), who are otherwiseexempt from the requirements of Part 135 but are included in the comprehensiveanti-drug program because they conduct operations for compensation or hire,and any contractors to these employers, must submit an anti-drug plan tothe FAA for approval, that includes procedures for all types of testingmandated by the rule, not later than 360 days after the effective dateof the final rule. These employers must implement the approved anti-drugprogram not later than 180 days after approval of the plan by the FAA.The FAA believes that this extension of time will enable small aviationentities to evaluate random drug testing programs of other companies, todevelop an appropriate method by which to comply with the drug testingprovisions of the rule, and to participate in any association or consortiumthat may be available to provide specimen collection, testing assistance,and EAP services. Also, the FAA believes that it is appropriate to requirethese employers to submit a plan that includes random testing, as opposedto implementation of random testing after other testing is implemented,because these employers will have a significant amount of time to developand implement a comprehensive anti-drug program for their employees.New aviation businesses that come into existence after the effective dateof the rule, and that are subject to the requirements of the final rule,will be required to comply with the schedule that is appropriate for thesize of the company and their particular operations. The FAA believes thatit is appropriate to adhere to the same time schedules that are set forthfor existing aviation entities in order to treat similarly-situated entitiesin a similar manner. However, it is possible that the timeframes may beaccelerated for new businesses in the furture as existing employer programsand consortia develop and continue to provide services to the aviationcommunity.The FAA has identified an issue that could unduly burden small commercialoperators who do not hold a Part 121 certificate or a Part 135 certificate,who conduct operations listed in andSection; 135.1(b), and who are includedin this final rule because they conduct operations for compensation orhire. Under the terms of the proposed rule, these commercial operatorswould have been unable to contract for aircraft maintenance or preventivemaintenance services. The proposed rule would have prohibited commercialoperators from using the services of employees who work for fixed baseoperators and repair stations that service only general aviation aircraftif the employees of these entities were not subject to an FAA-approvedcomprehensive anti-drug program. In an effort to relieve this unintendedburden, the FAA has included a new provision in the final rule directedsolely at those individuals or entities. This provision states, in essence,that an individual who is otherwise authorized may perform maintenanceand repair work on a commercial operator's aircraft, even if that individualis not covered by a comprehensive anti-drug program, in two specific instances.First, an individual who is not covered by the final rule can perform emergencyrepairs on an aircraft if the aircraft could not be operated safely toa location where a covered employee could perform the repairs. Second,an individual who is not covered by the final rule can perform aircraftmaintenance and preventive maintenance repairs on an aircraft if the operatorwould be required to transport the aircraft more than 50 nautical milesfurther than the closest available repair point from the operator's principalbase of operations in order to have the work performed by a covered employee.The FAA believes that this narrow exemption from the requirements of thefinal rule will benefit the small commercial operators subject to the finalrule but will not adversely affect the enhanced aviation safety intendedby the final rule.<T3>Medical Review Officer (MRO)</T3>. Several small entities, includingEAF, believe that an MRO should have the responsibility to determine ifan employee has been successfully rehabilitated and to determine when anemployee may return to duty. ATA also recommends that an MRO be involvedin the determination of an employee's successful rehabilitation. However,ATA notes that it would not always be feasible for an MRO to personallyinterview each employee who has a positive test result and recommends thatthe final rule accommodate that situation. RAA and Federal Express opposeany regulatory provision that would require an airline to appoint or todesignate an MRO as part of an anti-drug program.APFA believes that an MRO should be an independent physician who couldassist labor and management EAP officials during analysis of drug testresults and determination of the validity of test results in each employee'scase. AFA believes that it is imperative that an MRO have specific trainingin toxicology and addictive diseases. Even with this training, AFA believesan MRO should be responsible for monitoring any testing program and interpretingtest results to determine if referral to an EAP is warranted for a particularemployee. AFA states that evaluation and referral for treatment and determinationsregarding an employee's readiness to return to work should be made onlyby an EAP treatment professional. IUFA states that only the health careprofessional with whom an employee has been working is qualified to makea determination of when an employee is fit to return to duty. If an MROand the responsible health care official disagree, a neutral third partyshould evaluate an employee and determine if an employee is fit to returnto work. ALPA states that the determination of whether an individual hasbeen rehabilitated, at least in the case of pilots, must be made by theFederal Air Surgeon under the medical certification procedures containedin Part 67 of the Federal Aviation Regulations.<T3>FAA Response.</T3> In response to commenters who oppose the requriementto designate or appoint an MRO, the FAA notes that the rule does not requirethat each employer have its own individual MRO. The FAA anticipates thatsmall companies will become part of, or will associate with, large companiesor may participate in a consortium of small companies or associations,in order to comply with the MRO requirement of the final rule that willresult in reasonable costs to small employers.After consideration of the comments on the issue of MROs, the FAA has determinedthat the requirements proposed in the NPRM are appropriate. The FAA believesthat the review and evaluation functions of an MRO provide critical andnecessary safeguards for an employee who is subject to drug testing underthe comprehensive anti-drug program. The FAA believes that the MRO willprove to be a beneficial asset to both employees and employers who aresubject to the provisions of the final rule.However, the FAA has expanded the role of the MRO after review of the commentsand the proposed rule, although many of these responsibilities are contingenton an employer's decision to be involved in rehabilitation. For example,if an employer chooses to use an individual to perform a sensitive safety-or security-related function who has failed a drug test under this programand who has successfully completed rehabilitation, the MRO will developan unannounced testing schedule for that individual. The MRO is the finalarbiter in cases where an individual disputes a testing schedule afterreturn to duty. Except in cases where the Federal Air Surgeon is involved,as discussed below, the MRO also is the final arbiter regarding return-to-dutyrecommendations. The MRO also shall review any rehabilitation program inwhich an employee or an applicant participated, after failing a drug testconducted in accordance with Appendix I to Part 121, to determine if anemployee can return to duty or an applicant may be hired to perform a sensitivesafety- or security-related function for an employer.The FAA also has defined the factors that an MRO shall consider when makinga return-to-duty determination. The MRO is required by the final rule toensure that an individual is drug free as evidenced by a drug test; thatan individual has been evaluated by a rehabilitation counselor for druguse or abuse; and that an individual has complied with testing and counselingrequirements of a rehabilitation program. Thus, the MRO will have significantand sufficient information to recommend, based on the MRO's professionalopinion, that an individual or a current employee could perform a sensitivesafety- or security-related function for an employer.The FAA clarified the proposed requirement that the MRO ``conduct a medicalinterview'' with an employee as part of the review of a positive test result.The FAA did not intend that the proposal require a face-to-face interviewwith each employee. The final rule requires that the MRO provide an employeewith an opportunity to discuss a positive test result with the MRO. Thus,for example, the MRO is permitted to discuss the positive test result withthe employee by phone. The FAA believes that the clarification will relievesome administrative burdens on the MRO and employees in scheduling discussionsof a positive test result. The FAA also added several requirements to theMRO's list of duties. First, the MRO is required to notify an employeeof a confirmed positive test result within a reasonable time after verificationof the result. Second, the MRO must process an employee's request to retesta specimen. The final rule provides that the employee's request to retestmust be made in writing to the MRO within 60 days of notification of theconfirmed positive test result.In the NPRM, the FAA requested comment on who should make the decisionthat an employee had been successfully rehabilitated and could return toduty if the employee was drug free. ALPA specifically comments that return-to-dutydeterminations of pilots should be made by the Federal Air Surgeon consistentwith the medical certification procedures contained in Part 67 of the FederalAviation Regulations. Part 67 of the Federal Aviation Regulations define``drug dependence'' as a ``* * * condition in which a person is addictedto or dependent on drugs other than alcohol, tobacco, or ordinary caffeine-containingbeverages, as evidenced by habitual use or a clear sense of need for thedrug.'' After review of the comments and consideration of the medical standardscontained in Part 67, the FAA has determined that the Federal Air Surgeonmust be involved in the decision to return an individual who holds a Part67 medical certificate to a sensitive safety-related position. The FAAbelieves that it would be contrary to the statutory mandate to determinethe physical ability of an individual to perform duties pertaining to hisor her airman certificate if the FAA failed to participate in a return-to-dutydecision for an individual who holds a medical certificate.Thus, the FAA has clarified the responsibilities of the MRO for situationswhere an employer voluntarily becomes involved in rehabilitation of employeesor persons hired to perform sensitive safety- or security-related functionsthat require an individual to hold a medical certificate issue by the FAA.Under the rule, the MRO will perform all the duties and make all the determinationsrequired in Appendix I for those individuals who do not hold a medicalcertificate issued pursuant to Part 67 of the Federal Aviation Regulations.For those individuals whose position with the employer requires them tohold a Part 67 medical certificate, the MRO is required to make a preliminarydetermination, consistent with the standard contained in Part 67, of probabledrug dependence or a determination of nondependence. If the MRO makes adetermination of nondependence based on his professional opinion, the MROmay recommend that an employee return to duty in a sensitive safety- orsecurity-related position. The MRO is required to forward the finding ofnondependence, the decision to return the employee to duty, and any supportingdocumentation, to the Federal Air Surgeon for review.The FAA is aware that allowing an MRO to determine that an individual isnot drug dependent and, therefore, may return to work in a sensitive safety-or security-related position without prior clearance by the Federal AirSurgeon may be controversial and may be viewed as inconsistent with aviationsafety. However, in the FAA's opinion, it is consistent with aviation safetyto provide subsequent FAA review of the treatment and any medical determinationof nondependence that has been made by a competent licensed physician withknowledge of substance abuse disorders. The FAA also believes it is beneficialto provide subsequent review of an MRO's return-to-duty determinations,rather than initial review by the Federal Air Surgeon, so that an individualwho is not dependent on drugs can return to work as soon as possible. Moreover,any individual who returns to work after rehabilitation is subject to unannounedtesting as determined by the MRO and may be subject to ongoing counseling.Therefore, the FAA believes that initial determinations by an MRO and subsequentreview by the Federal Air Surgeon will result in effective and fair treatmentof individuals who are required to hold a medical certificate. At any point that an MRO, in this professional opinion, makes a determinationof probable drug dependence of an individual required to hold a medicalcertificate for a position, the MRO is required to report the name andother identifying information, and to forward all documentation that supportsthe determination, to the Federal Air Surgeon. If the MRO has made a probabledrug dependence determination of an individual required to hold a medicalcertificate, the MRO may not make a recommendation to return that individualto duty. From that point forward, the Federal Air Surgeon is responsiblefor determining whether the individual may keep a medical certificate ormay be issued a medical certificate consistent with the medical standardscontained in Part 67 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. Since drug dependencyis a disqualifying medical condition under Part 67 of the Federal AviationRegulations, it is critical that the Federal Air Surgeon be aware of anydetermination of probable drug dependence. An individual subject to themedical requirements of Part 67 who has a history of drug dependency mustreceive a ``special issuance'' medical certificate, issued at the discretionof the Federal Air Surgeon pursuant to andSection; 67.19, before returningto work in a sensitive safety-related position. The Federal Air Surgeonis required to determine if that individual is qualified to hold a medicalcertificate and is physically able to exercise the privileges of an airmancertificate. This determination, and the discretion to grant a specialissuance of a medical certificate, clearly are within the exclusive expertiseof the Federal Air Surgeon. The FAA has added a provision to the final rule that requires the MRO toreport the name of any current employee required to hold a medical certificateto perform a sensitive safety-related function who fails a drug test. TheMRO also is required to report the name of any individual who holds a medicalcertificate and applies for a position with the employer in which a medicalcertificate is required and who fails a preemployment drug test. The MROis required to report the names of these individuals to the Federal AirSurgeon because a positive drug test result clearly is probative evidenceof possible drug dependence which is a disqualifying condition under themedical standards of Part 67 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. Therefore,the FAA added this requirement to ensure that the FAA is aware of conditionsthat may affect an individual's ability to physically perform the dutiesof an airman. <T3>Administrative Matters and Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirementsof Appendix I to Part 121. </T3>The FAA received very few comments regardingthe reporting requirements of the proposed rules. ATA found the requirementsof Appendix I to be acceptable. ATA recommended that the FAA establisha date to analyze the data collected regarding drug testing and rehabilitationand to review the regulations. Suburban Airlines, as part of its analysisof the costs of the proposals, estimates that the administrative costsand record retention costs of testing its 211 employees would be $8,500per year. Federal Express supports auditing of annual, summary data bythe FAA that is supplied by an employer regarding the employer's anti-drugprogram. Federal Express does not object to submitting an anti-drug programfor the FAA's approval but believes that the 180-day implementation periodwill be insufficient if the final rule contains all of the requirementsproposed in the NPRM. <T3>FAA Response. </T3>The regulatory provision that require an employerto submit a comprehensive anti-drug program and summary reports of theemployer's program are critical measures to provide oversight of the industry'simplementation of the comprehensive anti-drug program. The FAA believesthat these minimal requirements are necessary to properly monitor the industryand to ensure compliance with the final rule. In addition, evaluation ofthe industry's implementation of the anti-drug program and the resultsof testing and rehabilitation programs will enable the FAA to review anydemonstrated trends of drug use in the aviation industry and to modifythe rules if warranted by the data. These reporting requirements are consistentwith the FAA's existing industry recordkeeping and reporting requirements.The FAA has modified the proposed recordkeeping and reporting provisionsin the final rule. First, the FAA has clarified the requirements and organizationof material that must be submitted in the employer's semi-annual reportand annual report. In order that the FAA may accurately assess informationsubmitted by an employer, the revised final rule provides that the employermust submit the total number of tests performed; the total number of testsperformed for each category of test; and the total number of positive testresults for each category of test given by an employer. These requirementsare in addition to the proposed requirement to provide information on thenumber of positive test results according to the function performed byan employee for each type of test and according to the type of drug indicatedby a positive drug test result. The FAA anticipates that requiring an employerto report the additional information will not overburden an employer becausedrug testing laboratories commonly report the bulk of this informationwhen reporting drug test results. For example, as part of the DOT procedures(49 CFR Part 40), a DHHS-certified laboratory is required to provide amonthly statistical summary of initial and confirmation urinalysis testingdata of employees tested during the month to the person responsible forcoordination of the drug program. The summary contains information on thenumber of specimens received for initial and confirmation testing; thenumber of specimens reported for initial testing; and the number of specimensreported positive for each of the five drugs or drug metabolites testedduring initial and confirmation testing [DOT ``Procedures for TransportationWorkplace Drug Testing Programs;'' 49 CFR Part 40).The FAA had proposed that an employer only keep records relating to thespecimen collection process in the NPRM. However, in light of other revisionsto the proposed rule made in response to the comments, the employer alsomust retain records of test results and records relating to any employeerehabilitation. For example, the MRO is required to report the names ofindividuals holding a Part 67 medical certificate who fail a drug testand to forward test result and rehabilitation information regarding allindividuals holding a medical certificate to the Federal Air Surgeon. Thus,the FAA has revised the recordkeeping provision of the proposed rule torequire that an employer keep adequate information with which an employerand the FAA can evaluate the anti-drug program and determine any trendsthat may develop in the commercial aviation industry. Pursuant to the finalrule, an employer is required to retain all confirmed positive test resultsand any rehabilitation records for five years. The employer may retainthese records longer than five years although extended record retentionis not required by the final rule. The FAA also added a provision to thefinal rule that requires an employer to keep any negative test resultsfor a period of 12 months. However, all records retained by the employerare subject to limited release, as discussed below, for any period of timethat the employer keeps these records.  <T3>Confidentiality of Test Results.</T3> Most small businesses, individuals,and labor unions support restrictions on the release of drug testing information.These commenters believe that the FAA should include a regulatory provisionprohibiting the release of any drug testing information about an employee. RAA believes that only the employer and the employee should have accessto the results of the anti-drug program. Conversely, ERA Aviation suggeststhat employers should be required to report the name, social security numbers,and certificate numbers of employees testing positive to the FAA. TWU statesthat test results should be confidential as to all persons, except an applicantor employee, absent written consent or valid compulsory process. The laboratorymay release confirmed positive test results or negative test results onlyto the employer's medical officer. TWU suggests that the medical officermay notify managerial or supervisory personnel who have a compelling needfor the information to implement employer's policies or may notify themedical personnel responsible for an employee's rehabilitation.  RAA and Federal Express believe that job applicants should be requiredto disclose prior test results to subsequent employers as a condition ofemployment. ATA believes that records of applicants for employment whohave tested positive in a preemployment drug test should be disclosed tothird persons in limited situations, including authorization from the applicant,litigation by the applicant, pursuant to a valid subpoena, and by orderof a court or administrative agency. However, ATA believes that test results,related personnel records, and rehabilitation data of incumbent employeesshould not be released to any person absent express consent of the employee.The Director of the Santa Maria Public Airport District believes that positivetest results of all employees and applicants should be retained in a centraldatabase and should be available to potential aviation employers. FederalExpress also believes that carriers should be free to exchange an employer'sdrug testing results and that the FAA should insulate carriers from liabilityfor this disclosure.  ALPA states that information regarding an employee's drug testing historyshould be treated as confidential information, and clearly stated in anyfinal rule, since it is ``extracted'' from the employee by requiring theemployee to submit to drug testing. A rule of confidentiality should applyto all information obtained pursuant to the regulation whether obtainedas a result of testing, interview, or examination, or treatment of an employee.ALPA believes that the only effective and appropriate rule is a completeban on disclosure of confidential drug testing information without theemployee's written consent. ALPA believes that a complete ban on disclosureis required for ethical reasons and to encourage candor by employees whendealing with medical professionals.  As a general matter, EEAC advocates protecting the privacy of individualswho undergo drug tests. EEAC believes that sharing of drug testing informationamong employers in a safety-sensitive industry has superficial appeal.However, EEAC advocates caution in allowing a subsequent employer to relysolely on information obtained as a result of a different company's drugtesting procedures.  <T3>FAA Response.</T3> The FAA has included a provision in the final rulethat will govern release of records of an employee's drug testing resultsand any rehabilitation information. The FAA has decided that the legitimateindividual privacy rights of an employee warrant strict limitations onthe availability of an employee's drug testing results and rehabilitationinformation. The final rule provides that the release of an individual'sdrug test results and any information about an employee's rehabilitationprogram is permitted only with the specific, written consent of the individual.Due to the specific provisions discussed previously, this restriction doesnot override the requirement to report test results and any rehabilitationinformation to the Federal Air Surgeon of an applicant or an employee whoholds a medical certificate who fails a drug test. The final rule alsoprovides that the FAA is entitled to examine these records and that thisinformation must be released to the NTSB as part of an accident investigationor to the FAA upon request.  <T3>Temporary Employees.</T3> The FAA solicited comments in the NPRM onthe proposed definition of temporary employees and their eligibility forrehabilitation. RAA agrees with the FAA's proposed definition that temporaryemployees are those individuals who are hired for a period of less than90 days. ATA and Federal Express propose a period of 120 days and TEMSCOHelicopters proposes a period of 150 days or less to determine an employee'seligibility for rehabilitation opportunities.RAA and ATA agree with the FAA's proposal to exclude temporary employeesfrom rehabilitation opportunities. RAA and ATA oppose the FAA's proposalto consider employees, who are eligible for reemployment by the same employerwithin 90 days following the original employment, as regular employeesof the industry and, therefore, eligible for rehabilitation opportunitiesif they are rehired by the airline.Several organizations, including TEMSCO Helicopters and ATA, comment thatthe time period of 90-day employment would adversely affect businesseswho employ individuals on a seasonal or contract basis for longer periodsof time. SSA states that small businesses should not be required to retainor to rehire a part-time or temporary employee who volunteers for, or otherwiseparticipates in, rehabilitation. <T3>FAA Response. </T3>In the NPRM, the FAA requested comment on the definitionof a temporary employee and whether employers should be required to offerrehabilitation opportunities and job security to temporary employees. Afterconsideration of the comments and due to deletion of the requirement tooffer rehabilitation and job security to employees, a definition of temporaryemployees in the final rule is unnecessary. Therefore, an employer is notrequired by the rule to offer an opportunity for rehabilitation or to holda position open for any temporary employee.However, the final rule makes no distinction regarding testing of temporaryemployees. Thus, an employer is required by the final rule to include temporaryemployees in its drug testing program. The burden of testing temporaryemployees is slight when compared to the significant risk that a temporaryemployee who uses drugs poses to aviation safety. Thus, the FAA believesthat it is important to test temporary employees for the presence of drugsor drug metabolites that may adversely affect performance of a sensitivesafety- or security-related function. Many ``temporary'' employees, whoactually are recurring seasonal employees or are regularly and containuallyrehired at the end of specified term, are ``permanent'' members of theaviation industry. The FAA firmly believes that these individuals clearlyshould be included in an employer's drug testing program in the interestof aviation safety. In addition, these employees, although they may consistentlyperform sensitive safety- or security-related functions pursuant to short-termcontracts for different employers, should be included in EAP educationprograms because of their continuous involvement in commercial aviationactivities.<T3>Uniformity versus Flexibility. </T3>ATA, American Airlines, Delta Airlines,IUFA, and IFFA believe that all employers and employees should be subjectto uniform minimum rules and requirements in the area of drug testing.These entities strongly believe that company-specific plans may dilutethe effectiveness of the anti-drug program or lead to harassment of employees.EEAC supports the concept of employer flexibility to design specific anti-drugprograms. EEAC believes that each employer should determine the circumstancesof employee drug testing and the content of employee assistance programs.EEAC supports preemployment testing, postaccident testing, periodic testingincident to scheduled physical examinations, and testing based on reasonablecause. EEAC believes employers should have the option or requiring randomtesting of employees. EEAC readily endorses EAP services and rehabilitation of employees butbelieves that these benefits should not be mandated by the government.Decisions whether an employee has been rehabilitated and whether an employeeshould be permitted to return to work should be determined by the individualemployer acting with the guidance of professionals involved in an employee'srehabilitation. Federal Express believes that use of controlled substances at any time,whether on or off the job, should be prohibited due to the critical safetyconcerns in the aviation industry. Federal Express states that such a prohibition``* * * helps ensure safe operation of aircraft and protects employeesand the general public from unnecessary safety hazards.'' However, FederalExpress believes that the FAA should impose only minimum regulatory requirementsof a drug testing and rehabilitation program and allow carriers to structureindividual programs for their particular employees. <T3>FAA Response. </T3>The FAA agrees with the Commenters who concludethat mandating minimum, uniform requirements for comprehensive anti-drugprograms in the commercial aviation industry is necessary in order to maximizethe effectiveness of the program and to achieve a safe and drug-free commercialaviation workforce. The FAA believes that the comprehensive anti-drug programpromulgated in this final rule meets the agency's statutory mandate topromote the safety of civil aircraft operating in air commerce and thatit responds to the public's need for a safe aviation environment. In response to the comments, particularly in the area of anti-drug programsimplemented by small aviation entities, the FAA has addressed the needfor employer flexibility by revising the program requirements or the implementationdates. The FAA has not included specific, detailed provisions regardingthe content and requirements of an individual's treatment due to the significantvariables that affect these components based on each individual, the typeof drug used, and the level of any drug use, drug dependence, or drug addiction.Thus, in the area of an employee's rehabilitation treatment plan, the FAAagrees that this decision is best left to the discretion of those individualswho are significantly and directly involved in the employee's rehabilitation.The FAA has imposed uniform, minimum requirements on employers and employeesin other areas of the comprehensive program. Although employers are requiredto comply with the minimum requirements, employers may expand the minimumtesting requirements to include other employees or may offer EAP servicesand rehabilitation opportunities to employees. If the employer expandsits anti-drug program, any additional components of the employer's anti-drugprogram may not contradict or dilute the effectiveness of the FAA's finalrule. As stated in the NPRM, while the FAA would not prohibit employersfrom taking independent actions beyond those required by the rule, suchactions may not adversely affect the final rule and would not be authorizedby the FAA. Therefore, additional benefits or more stringent procedureswould not be considered part of the employer's approved program.The FAA received many comments for revision of the final rule to includetesting for additional drugs and permission for an employer to use analyticalprocedures that are not addressed in the DHHS guidelines. The Departmentof Transportation will address the issue of testing for additional drugsin the DOT ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs''(49 CFR Part 40). DOT intends to follow the proposed DHHS guidelines whichallow testing for other drugs, in addition to the five drugs specifiedin the appendix, only in the context of testing based on reasonable cause.Neither this final rule nor the DOT procedures address the issue of anemployer's ability to test for drugs, other than the drugs specified bythe FAA, to the extent that an employer has independent legal authorityto test for other drugs.<T3>Regulatory Consent. </T3>AOPA believes that the FAA should eliminatethe regulatory section that would require a pilot to submit to a drug testrequested by an employer, a local law enforcement officer, or an FAA inspector.AOPA asserts that the FAA does not have the authority or the expertiseto administer a drug test and that refusal to sumbit to a test is bestleft to local law.ATA agrees with the sanctions proposed for an employee's refusal to submitto a required test. Henson Airlines has an existing policy that an employee'srefusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test will result in disciplinaryaction that could include dismissal from the company.<T3>FAA Response. </T3>The FAA has not revised the provisions proposedin the NPRM that would provide sanctions for an employee's refusal to submitto a drug test required as part of the comprehensive anti-drug program.The FAA believes that the sanctions proposed in the NPRM are appropriateand are necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of the anti-drugprogram. In response to AOPA's comment, the FAA would not ``administer''a drug test under this provision. The FAA would simply request that theemployee submit to a drug test, collected and analyzed consistent withthe DOT procedures of 49 CFR Part 40, where testing would be otherwiseauthorized under an anti-drug program. This provision is necessary primarilyin the area of postaccident drug testing where the FAA may be the onlyofficial at the scene of an accident with the authority to request thatan individual submit to a postaccident drug test.The FAA also believes that compliance with the testing requirements ofthe final rule is not an issue that is best left to local law. As a preliminarymatter, the FAA has clear statutory authority to promote and maintain aviationsafety. Second, the FAA is the entity that issues airman certificates andthat is charged with ensuring that an airman is qualified to exercise theprivileges of that Federal certificate. Finally, sanctions imposed pursuantto State or local law may vary widely among each jurisdiction and wouldsubject similarly-situated employees to dissimilar treatment accordingto the content of the local law. Therefore, the FAA believes that it isappropriate to provide that an individual is disabled from performing asensitive safety- or security-related function and to include sanctionsfor a failure to submit to a drug test to promote aviation safety and toensure consistent treatment of individuals engaged in commercial aviation.<T3>Existing Regulations.</T3> AOPA, several small aviation entities, andmany individual commenters believe that the FAA's existing regulations,and increased FAA enforcement of these regulations, are sufficient to dealwith any drug problem in the aviation industry.A commenter speaking as national litigation counsel for AOPA and on behalfof the California Aviation Council and the Orange County Aviation Associationbelieves that the types of testing proposed by the FAA are duplicativeof the existing opportunities for testing in the periodic medical examinationof commercial and air transport pilots. In addition, this commenter statesthat the FAA has the authority, pursuant to andSection; 609 of the FederalAviation Act, to reexamine or reinspect any airman at any time. Therefore,the commenter believes that the FAA could implement a lawful drug testingprogram within the existing infrastructure of the FAA's certification procedures.The commenter also states that the regulations proposed in the NPRM createan irreconcilable conflict with the FAA's safety-enhancement enforcementsystem. The commenter believes that the proposed anti-drug program willprove detrimental to aviation safety because the number of enforcementcases brought by the FAA for violations of the proposed regulations willoverburden the FAA and the administrative law judges assigned to hear enforcementcases.<T3>FAA Response.</T3> The FAA disagrees with the commenters who statethat the comprehensive anti-drug program requirements are redundant andthat increased enforcement of the existing regulations or reexaminationof individual airmen will result in a drug-free commercial aviation environment.The existing regulations do not address the issue of drug testing of aviationpersonnel performing sensitive safety- or security-related functions incommercial aviation. Thus, in the FAA's opinion, enforcement of existingregulations or individual reexamination will not sufficiently deter anydrug use in commercial aviation. In addition, the existing regulationsdo not address the critical issues of procedural safeguards in collectionand testing of samples for the presence of drugs or drug metabolites thatare provided in the DOT procedures of 49 CFR Part 40.Establishing a drug testing program within the existing ``infrastructure''of the existing certification procedures is equivalent to implementingonly a periodic testing requirement. Because of an individual's abilityto circumvent periodic testing, based on a relatively short abstinencefrom drug use, periodic testing alone is not a sufficient deterrent todrug use in commercial aviation. The FAA believes that it is appropriateand necessary to provide minimum requirements, applicable to employersand employees, that will achieve a drug-free commercial aviation environment.<T3>Preemption of State and Local Laws.</T3> ATA, Federal Express, andRAA recommend that the FAA insert a regulatory provision that explicitlyproscribes State or local legislation that would interfere with the consistentand uniform testing and rehabilitation opportunities for aviation employeesmandated by this final rule.<T3>FAA Response.</T3> The FAA agrees with the commenters who are criticallyconcerned about conflicting State and local laws that would interfere withan effective comprehensive anti-drug program. The FAA believes that inconsistentlaws or regulations applicable to the subject matter of this final rulewill frustrate the intent of the rule and severely hamper implementationand administration of an anti-drug program. Therefore, the FAA has includeda preemption provision in the final rule that is intended to enhance theefficiency and effectiveness of the requirements of the final rule.The FAA's issuance of the final rule preempts any State or local law, ruleregulation, order, or standard that covers testing of commercial aviationemployees for the presence of drugs or drug metabolites. The new rule doesnot preempt any State law that imposes sanctions for the violation of aprovision of a State criminal code related to reckless conduct leadingto actual loss of life, injury or damage to property, whether such provisionsapply specifically to aviation employees or generally to the public. Thescope of the authority preempted by this final rule and the authority reservedto the States is essentially identical to the provision in the regulationsissued by the Federal Railroad Administration of the Department of Transportation(49 CFR 219.13).<T3>Waivers or Exemptions.</T3> ATA believes that waivers and modificationsof an employer's drug testing program should be granted if exceptionalcircumstances warrant the waiver or modification and if an equivalent levelof safety can be maintained under the terms of the waiver. American Airlinesadvocates that all carriers should be subject to identical requirementsand waivers should not be granted.<T3>FAA Response.</T3> The final rule sets forth minimum requirements thatmust be included in an employer's anti-drug program. However, the rulegenerally does not set forth detailed program administration requirementsin most areas of the program. Also, an employer is not prohibited fromestablishing an anti-drug program that goes beyond the minimum requirementspromulgated by this rule. As a result of the FAA approval process of anemployer's anti-drug program, a certain amount of discretion and flexibilityis retained for an employer's administration of its anti-drug program.On this basis, the FAA has determined that any requests for exemption froma requirement of this rule should be handled in the same manner as requestsfor exemptions of other FAA regulations under Part 11 of the Federal AviationRegulations. The FAA believes that a case-by-case determination will benecessary to ensure that any exemptions from the requirements of this finalrule are in the public interest.ContractorsThe FAA has revised the proposed rule as it applies to contractors whoseemployees perform sensitive safety- or security-related service for aviationentities subject to the rule. Under the proposed rule, contractors whoseemployees perform covered service to aviation entities were authorizedto submit their own plans to the FAA to implement directly an anti-drugprogram. These contractor employees also could have been included in theanti-drug program of the aviation entity for whom they were providing services.However, for the final rule, the FAA concluded that all persons performingsensitive safety- or security-related functions should be under the planof the aviation entity for whom they provide the services.The FAA believes that administration of the anti-drug program would bevastly more efficient_for aviation entities directly subject to the rule,contractors, and the FAA_by reducing the proliferation of different planssubmitted by a significant number of contractors who provide covered serviceto the same aviation entity. In addition, the FAA believes that limitingthe submission of plans to those aviation entities directly subject tothe rule will provide a more consistent approach to administration of industryanti-drug programs and will minimize the difficulties of ensuring compliancewith the final rule. As noted earlier in this preamble, the final ruleprovides that an employee who is subject to the requirements of any employer'sFAA-approved anti-drug program may provide sensitive safety- or security-relatedservices to any other employer. Therefore, so long as a contractor employeeis covered by one aviation entity's anti-drug program, the employee wouldbe able to provide services for any employer subject to the rule. Thus,a contactor whose employees provide services to multiple aviation entitieswould not be subject to any greater burden than those entities directlysubject to the rule.Additional Issues<T3>Alcohol. </T3>The NTSB, AMA, Henson Airlines, and other individualcommenters suggest that the FAA include alcohol as a tested substance inany required testing program.The FAA expressly excluded the issue of alcohol testing from this rulemakingfor a variety of reasons stated in the NPRM; therefore, these commentsare beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Excluding alcohol testing fromthis rulemaking should not be construed to mean that the FAA is ignoringthe fact that alcohol may be a substance of widespread abuse in the aviationindustry. As stated in the NPRW, the FAA will continue to review the effectivenessof regulations dealing with the issue of alcohol use and abuse in aviationand may consider additional rulemaking action in the future. In addition,employers are not prohibited from initiating alcohol testing programs fortheir employees if not otherwise prohibited from testing for alcohol.The Department of Transportation will include a provision in the DOT precedures(49 CFR Part 40) that will enable an employer to test for the presenceof alcohol in an employee's system. Pursuant to those procedures, the employercould include testing for alcohol in testing protocols only pursuant toFAA approval if the testing is authorized under the FAA regulations.<T3>Testing for additional drugs. </T3>The NTSB recommends that the FAAexpand the list of prohibited drugs to include those substances listedin Schedule III and Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act. The NTSBalso recommends that the FAA develop a medical exemption process to providefor a pilot's legitimate medical use of these substances. ATA recommendsthat mind-altering prescription drugs, such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines,methadone, and methaqualone, also be listed as prohibited drugs in anydrug testing program. ERA Aviation supports this recommendation and suggeststhat propoxyphene, quaaludes, and codeine be added to the list of drugsthat would be screened.The five drugs specifically listed in Appendix I to Part 121 are the fivedrugs for which DHHS has set cutoff levels and testing protocols in itsmandatory guidelines (53 FR 11970, 11973-11974; April 11, 1988). The Departmentof Transportation intends to adopt these cutoff levels and testing protocolsverbatim in its procedures applicable to the aviation industry (49 CFRPart 40). An employer is required to test for marijuana, cocaine, opiates,phencyclidine (PCP), amphetamines, and metabolites of those drugs becauseof the incidence and prevalence of use of these drugs in the general populationand based on the experience of the Department of Defense and the Departmentof Transportation in their drug testing programs. Because analysis of additional,less-frequently used drugs could result in substantial additional expense,the FAA believes that requiring an employer to test for these five drugsis appropriate at this time. Any testing for other drugs, beyond the specifieddrugs listed in the appendix, is authorized only in the context of testingbased on reasonable cause. Only if, in that context, the FAA authorizestesting for additional Drug X under 49 CFR Part 40 (an approval which wouldbe granted only after consultation with the Department of Health and HumanServices, and only on the basis of an HHS-established testing protocoland positive threshhold) may the employer also test the sample for thatdrug.Absent such an approval, if the employer wants to test, in addition, forDrug Y, the employer must obtain a second sample from the employee. Theobtaining of this second sample is not under the authority of the DOT regulation.The employer must base its request for the second sample on whatever otherlegal authority is available, since the employer cannot rely on the DOTregulation as the basis for the request.The FAA is aware that listing the drugs that will be analyzed as part ofa drug testing program may result in individuals using alternative drugsthat are not analyzed pursuant to the final rule. As part of the agency'sreview and anlaysis of the industry's anti-drug programs, the FAA encouragesthe aviation industry to notify the FAA if different drugs are being usedin the aviation community. As part of the FAA's oversight of the comprehensiveanti-drug program, the FAA will seek statistical information, to the extentany information is available, from the National Institute on Drug Abuse(NIDA), other Federal agencies, and any other source to determine if additional,different drugs should be included in the comprehensive anti-drug programto ensure aviation safety.<T3>Testing of other individuals</T3>. Several commenters, including theAMA, NTSB, ATA, and ALPA, suggest that the FAA expand the list of individualsto be tested, or defined as sensitive safety- and security-related employees,under the regulations. Several entities recommended that the FAA requiretesting of all individuals certificated by the FAA, including general aviationpilots. ALPA, ATA, and Martin Aviation recommend that any employee whoperforms a function in or around an aircraft (deicing, weight and balancecomputation, fueling, taxiing or towing aircraft, weather forecasting,baggage handlers, and cargo personnel) and supervisors of covered employeesbe subject to testing because these individuals affect aviation safety.Federal Express states that it would include ramp agents responsible forweight and balance of an aircraft, deicers, and fuelers in a drug testingprogram. Federal Express supports inclusion of aviation security screenersin a drug testing program although it does not employ these individuals.ALPA and American Airlines also urge the FAA to include corporate officersin any testing program. The Director of the Santa Maria Public AirportDistrict suggests that the FAA amend Part 107, Part 108, and Part 139 toensure that employees of certificated airport operators are included inthe anti-drug program. Tramco, Inc. suggests that Part 145 be amended sothat repair station employers are required to comply with the anti-drugrequirements in the same manner as Part 121 certificate holders. Tramcoalso suggests that aircraft manufacturers be required to implement an anti-drugprogram. After review of these various comments, the FAA has retained the basicregulatory list of functions proposed in the NPRM. However, the FAA haseliminated parachute rigging duties from the list of functions containedin Appendix I to Part 121. The activities performed by parachute riggersdo not have a direct and significant impact on the safe operation of civilaircraft as do the other sensitive safety- and security-related functionslisted in the appendix. The FAA has not revised the rule to require drug testing of supervisoryor managerial employees. However, the FAA notes that under the proposedrule and the final rule, supervisory or managerial employees who performsensitive safety- or security-related functions for an employer are notpermitted to perform these functions, either on a permanent or temporarybasis, unless those employees are subject to the requirements of the employer'santi-drug program. Also, repair station employers and employees are subjectto the requirements of an anti-drug program if these individuals providecontract service to an employer who is subject to the requirements of thisfinal rule. Under the terms of the rule, a Part 121 certificate holder,a Part 135 certificate holder, or an entity or individual covered by therule because they operate for compensation or hire may only use the servicesof persons who are subject to the requirements of an FAA-approved program.Therefore, although Part 145 was not amended, repair station employersand employees are included to the extent that they provide contract serviceor repair aircraft operated by an employer subject to the final rule. The comprehensive anti-drug programs, proposed by the operating administrationswithin the Department of Transportation, focus on drug testing for variouscommercial transportation activities. The scope and direction of the FAA'scomprehensive anti-drug program is consistent with the present Department-widepolicy. The FAA encourages the public and members of the aviation industry to submitinformation to the FAA (directed to the person listed in the heading<T2> ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT''</T2>) that may warrant inclusionof different drugs in a drug testing program or additional categories ofemployees to be tested. If it is necessary to preserve confidentialityof any information submitted to the FAA, the FAA encourages aviation industryrepresentatives or trade associations to transmit the information to theFAA. The FAA will monitor the date gathered pursuant to this program, andwill continue to review other information regarding drug use in privateand commercial aviation, to determine if further rulemaking action in thisarea is required or necessary. The FAA may revise other sections of theFederal Aviation Regulations, to broaden the applicability and scope ofthe comprehensive anti-drug program, if further study warrants this action.The final rule does not prohibit an employer from testing any other employeeor group of employees, if the employer is not otherwise prohibited, thatthe employer determines should be tested for drugs to provide safety orefficiency in the workplace. <T3>Conflict with foreign laws or policies</T3>. We have determined notto make the rule applicable in any situation where compliance would violatethe domestic laws or policies of another country. In addition, becauseof the potential confusion that may exist involving application of thisrule in situations where compliance could violate foreign laws or policies,we have determined not to make the rule applicable, until January 1, 1990,in any situation where a foreign government contends that compliance withour rule raises questions of compatibility with its domestic laws or policies.During the next year, the Department of Transportation and other U.S. governmentofficials will be working closely with representatives of foreign governmentswith the goal of reaching a permanent resolution to any conflict betweenour rule and foreign laws and policies. The U.S. and Canadian Governmentshave already established a bilateral working group in an attempt to achievethis objective. We believe that considerable progress has already beenmade, and further meetings will be held in the near future. While we believethat this can be a model for addressing the concerns of other countries,it is not intended to be the exclusive means. The Administrator may delaythe effective date further under this section, if such delay is necessaryto permit consultation with any foreign governments to be successfullycompleted. It is the agency's intention to issue a notice no later than December 1,1989, that would make any necessary amendments to the rule as a resultof discussions with foreign governments. Shortly after their issuance,any such notices will be published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4>. While we recognize that any decision not toapply our rule to foreign citizens has the potential to create some anomalousconditions in competitive situations, it is the intention of the U.S. Governmentto make every effort to resolve potential conflicts with foreign governmentsin a manner that accommodates their concerns while ensuring the necessarylevel of safety by those we regulate.<T3>Statutory authority. </T3>One commenter questions the authority ofthe FAA to promulgate regulations that proscribe recreational drug useby any airman during his or her free time that does not impair the airman'sperformance on the job. As stated by the commenter, the FAA's mandate isto ensure the safety of civil aviation and not to enforce criminal drugenforcement laws. The FAA clearly has the statutory authority to mandate continuing eligibilityrequirements and minimum physical and medical standards to promote anddevelop safety in air commerce and civil aeronautics. For example, theFAA has clear authority to prohibit off-duty consumption of alcohol priorto aircraft operation to ensure that a crewmember is not impaired by alcoholwhile acting or attempting to act as a crewmember of a civil aircraft.Similarly, in the FAA's opinion, this broad authority includes the authorityand ability to prohibit the presence of any drug or drug metabolite inan individual's system that may adversely affect aviation safety. As noted in the NPRM, it often is difficult to detect the subtle and varyingdegrees of drug impairment to motor skills and judgment that are criticalto aircraft operation or performance of sensitive safety- and security-relatedduties. Certain drugs or drug metabolites remain in an individual's systemlong after use and may impair an individual's subsequent performance. Indeed,the Vice President of a national firm providing consultation services ondrug abuse prevention to American Airlines, with significant experiencein identification and treatment of drug users, states that marijuana usedisrupts recall and short-term memory and that there is serious impairmentof skills appropriate to industrial operations for 10 to 12 hours aftersmoking a single marijuana cigarette. The FAA believes that it is clearlyin the public interest and within the FAA's statutory authority to ensurethat any ``hangover effect'' associated with recreational use of illegaldrugs does not interfere with an individual's performance and, thus, jeopardizeair safety. Summary of Significant Changes From the Proposed Rule The FAA amended several sections of the proposed rule in response to commentsreceived from the public on the issues and in response to questions raisedin the NPRM. Any changes that significantly altered the requirements ofthe anti-drug program are discussed previously and are summarized in thissection. The definition of an ``employee'' in Appendix I to Part 121 was amendedto make it clear that employees of an entity that holds both a Part 121certificate and a Part 135 certificate are to be considered employees ofthe Part 121 certificate holder. This will ensure that all employees ofa single entity, regardless of the type of operating certificate held bythe employer, are subject to the same requirements and time schedules forthe purposes of an anti-drug program. The definition of ``employer'' also was amended. This section was amendedto make it clear that an employee of one company that has implemented ananti-drug program may perform sensitive safety- or security-related functionsfor another employer. For example, a mechanic employed by American Airlines,who is covered by American's anti-drug program, is permitted to performmaintenance duties or repair work on an aircraft owned by United Airlines.The Department of Transportation has determined that certain modificationsof the DHHS guidelines, proposed in the NPRM, are appropriate for thisrulemaking. The FAA has referenced a DOT interim final rule (49 CFR Part40), entitled ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs,''in this final rule. The FAA did not revise significantly the section of the appendix regardingthe substances for which testing must be conducted. However, the appendixprovides that testing for drugs listed in Schedule I and Schedule II ofthe Controlled Substances Act is permitted only during testing based onreasonable cause. In addition, the testing must be conducted in accordancewith the DOT ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs''and pursuant to the employer's approved anti-drug program. The FAA clarified the preemployment testing provision to make it clearthat an employer may use a person to perform a sensitive safety- or security-relatedfunction who passed a previous preemployment drug test for an employerand has continuously been subject to testing under an approved anti-drugprogram even if the individual is not currently employed by that employer.The rule prohibits an employer from ``hiring'' any person after failinga preemployment drug test. The rule does not require an employer to testevery applicant but only to test an applicant before he or she is actuallyhired by the employer. The periodic testing provision was revised to make it clear that an employeeis only required to provide one specimen for testing during the employee'sfirst periodic medical examination in the first calendar year of implementationof the final rule. Also, this section was revised to enable an employerto discontinue periodic drug testing of employees as part of a medicalexamination after the first full calendar year of implementation of theemployer's anti-drug program. After the first year of implementation, theemployer's random testing program should be fully implemented and periodictesting as part of a medical examination may be eliminated. The FAA revised the random testing provision of the final rule in responseto the comments and with reference to the plans of the random testing programstarted by the Department of Transportation. The final rule provides forphased implementation of unannounced testing based on random selectionbeginning with an annualized rate equal to 25 percent of covered employeesduring the first 12 months of program implementation. Thereafter, the employermust achieve and maintain an annualized testing rate equal to 50 percentof the covered employees. The FAA also added a provision that would enablean employer to randomly select employees for unannounced testing basedon a method, other than the methods originally proposed in the NPRM, thathas been approved by the FAA. The FAA has amended the postaccident testing provision. The revised sectionrequires an employer to ensure that postaccident testing is conducted assoon as possible but not later than 32 hours after an accident. As discussed previously, the FAA has expanded the bases upon which an employermay substantiate the determination to test an employee based on reasonablecause. In order to address concerns expressed in the comments, the FAAhas included a provision in this section that allows a small aviation employerto test an employee based on a determination of reasonable cause made byonly one supervisor trained in detection of drug use symptoms. As proposedin the NPRM, an employer may test an employee performing a sensitive safety-or security-related function for any Schedule I or Schedule II drug, ifthe employer conducts the testing based on reasonable cause in a mannerconsistent with the employer's approved anti-drug program and the DOT procedures(49 CFR Part 40). In response to comments specifically solicited in the NPRM, the FAA hasincluded a provision for unannounced testing after an employee's returnto duty. Employees who failed a drug test or who refused to submit to adrug test and who have not received a recommendation to return to dutyfrom an MRO must be tested in accordance with the return-to-duty provisionof the final rule. This section requires an employer to implement a reasonableprogram of unannounced testing, for not longer than 60 months, after anindividual has been hired or an employee has returned to duty to performa sensitive safety- or security-related function. The FAA has expanded the role of the medical review officer (MRO). Forexample, the MRO will review rehabilitation programs to determine if anemployee may return to duty or an individual may be hired to perform asensitive safety- or security-related function for an employer. The MROalso is the final arbiter in the case of disputes regarding a schedulefor unannounced testing after an employee's return to duty. The FAA hasadded several provisions to this section to describe the duties of an MROand the involvement of the Federal Air Surgeon where an individual whoholds a medical certificate tests positive for the presence of a drug ordrug metabolite. The FAA has added a provision that protects the confidentiality of employeedrug testing results and any rehabilitation information. This informationmay be released by an employer only with the written consent of the employee.However, the FAA may examine test result and rehabilitation records andthe information may be released to the NTSB as part of an accident investigationor to the FAA upon request. For various reasons discussed previously and in response to many comments,the FAA determined that opportunities for rehabilitation and job securityfor employees will not be mandated by this final rule. Rehabilitation opportunitiesand job security issues may be considered by an employer and should bedetermined by employers and employees in the specific employment context.The FAA has tailored the schedule proposed in the NPRM for submitting ananti-drug program to the FAA and implementation of an anti-drug programin response to comments received in response to the NPRM. These changeshave been fully discussed previously. In essence, the large aviation companiesare required to comply with the schedules proposed in the NPRM. Smalleraviation companies have additional time to develop and implement an interimanti-drug program and slightly broader timeframes to develop and submita random testing program. The smallest aviation entities covered by therule initially have additional time to develop and implement testing programsfor their employees. The FAA also has included a section in Appendix I to Part 121 to providefor the preemptive effect of these regulations regarding any State or locallaw covering the subject matter of drug testing of commercial aviationemployees. However, issuance of the final rule does not preempt State criminallaws that impose sanctions for reckless conduct leading to death, injury,or property damage. Comments on the Cost of the Anti-Drug Program Most small entities object to the anti-drug program based on the financialand administrative burden that these entities believe would result fromimplementation of the rule as proposed. Executive Air Fleet (EAF) is aPart 135 certificate holder with 200 employees who would be covered bythe proposed rules. Because drug testing is widespread in other industries,EAF states that the aviation industry should ``move ahead'' with the proposedrules. However, EAF states that the potential costs of an anti-drug programcould be burdensome even to an operation the size of EAF. EAF estimatesthat drug testing as proposed in the NPRM would cost $25,000 annually totest its 200 covered employees. EAP services would cost up to $26 per employee.EAF believes that EAP services would have to be available to the totalemployee population, not only sensitive safety- or security-related employees,because it is a benefit offered to employees. Thus, EAF estimates thatEAP services for a business employing 400 individuals would cost $10,400annually. Metro Air is a Part 135 certificate holder using two single-engine aircraft,two light twin-engine aircraft, and three helicopters. Metro Air also isa flight school operator using 15 aircraft. Metro Air employs six full-timepilots and four to five part-time pilots. Metro Air states that the proposedrule is not financially feasible for small commercial operators becausethe company is not in a position to retain or offer rehabilitation to anemployee who tests positive for drugs and the cost of hiring an MRO tointerpret test results would be prohibitive. Metro Air believes that theFAA should conduct all drug testing of employees and administer any rehabilitationoffered to an employee. Ryder Systems, Inc. employs over 40,000 individuals who perform a varietyof jobs in the transportation industry. Ryder Systems implemented an EAPin 1984. Ryder Systems estimates that 40 percent of the employees enrolledin the EAP due to controlled substance abuse problems require 28- to 30-dayinpatient treatment that costs between $10,000 to $20,000. The averagecost for controlled substance rehabilitation per employee is $3,000. Onthis basis, Ryder Systems believes that the FAA should only require thatan employer establish an EAP and offer EAP services to an employee butshould not specify the details of an EAP or rehabilitation program. However,Ryder Systems believes that the FAA should preserve the employer's discretionto determine EAP eligibility standards for employees, treatment of repeatoffenders, and the conditions for allowing an employee to return to work.American Airlines estimates that rehabilitation and treatment of an employeecosts $8,000. For this reason and to ensure that the quality of treatmentwill lead to a reasonable prognosis for recovery, American Airlines believesthat employers and contractors should be financially responsible for rehabilitation.Conversely, RAA and several small aviation entities, including Martin Aviation,Inc., believe that the FAA should not force airlines to incur the costof employee rehabilitation due to the economic impact of the requirementon the regional airline industry. RAA states that the average cost of a single random test would be $55 andthat retesting for verification of positive results could cost up to $80per test. On this basis, RAA estimates that the cost of random testingat a rate of 125 percent annually for regional airline pilots only willapproach $500,000 annually. Due to the high cost of testing at a rate of125 percent and the fact that the proposed rules would require testingof other aviation safety-related personnel in addition to pilots, RAA suggeststhat a random sampling rate of 50 percent would be appropriate. Suburban Airlines employs 211 employees who would be covered by the proposedprogram. Suburban estimates that the FAA's program would cost over $28,000annually at present employment levels. Based on Suburban's experience,5 percent of intial tests indicate positive results for the presence ofdrugs and must be confirmed to verify the initial test results. Tramco,Inc., a certificated repair station, estimates that compliance with theanti-drug program will cost $24,000 annually plus counseling and lost timecosts. ALPA believes that the FAA incorrectly estimated the cost of the proposedanti-drug program and, therefore, the drug testing program is not justifiedby any reasonable cost-benefit analysis. ALPA states that the laboratorycost per test, assuming a random testing rate of 125 percent and a negotiatedcost similar to the cost contained in the economic analysis, is merelya fraction of the total costs associated with a drug testing program. ALPAmaintains that a drug testing program could cost at least $280 millionper year. ALPA's estimate of cost is based on substantial administrativeand personnel expenses, transportation of employees to a collection site,employee compensation during collection of a specimen, and compensationof employees who replace employees being tested during revenue flights.A commenter speaking as national litigation counsel for AOPA and on behalfof the California Aviation Council and the Orange County Aviation Associationbelieves that the FAA understated the costs and overgeneralized the benefitsof the proposed rule contained in the economic summary of the NPRM. Thiscommenter also believes that the FAA failed to consider more effective,practical, and less intrusive programs to deal with any drug problem thatmight exist in the aviation industry. The commenter states that the economicanalysis fails to consider the potentially destructive economic effectof the proposed rules on small, commercial operators. Therefore, the commenterstates that the FAA may not issue a final rule because the FAA has failedto meet the criteria of Executive Order 12291. California Aeromedical Rescue and Evacuation, Inc. (CARE) does not believethat the proposed rules are reasonable due to the lack of evidence of adrug problem in aviation. CARE comments that the cost of maintaining adrug testing program, whether or not that program includes random testing,is significant. CARE employs 10 pilots, 4 mechanics, and approximately45 flight nurses and flight medics. CARE estimates that the cost per testis $45 and, therefore, the fiscal impact on its operations will be between$8,000 to $12,000 per year. CARE believes that its scarce financial resourcesshould be used for training, equipment, and maintenance. CARE states thatpreemployment and probable cause testing are wise and prudent measures.CARE predicts that including other types of testing will cause some ofits employees to leave the company due to issues related to the constitutionalityof unannounced testing without particularized suspicion of drug use. CAREstates that the costs of litigation and training for new employees shouldbe directed to other more useful avenues.The commenters stress that while the costs developed by the FAA may beappropriate for larger companies, who are able to take advantage of ``economiesof scale,'' small aviation companies would incur significantly higher costs.Two commenters who submitted a joint comment on the economic analysis containedin the NPRM dispute the benefits of the proposals in the NPRM, particularlywith the FAA's estimate of the possible detection rate. These commenterspresent statistical analyses, using the data in the NPRM on general aviationpilots, to demonstrate, in their opinion, a considerably reduced detectionrate and, therefore, considerably reduced benefits.<T3>FAA Response. </T3>The FAA agrees that costs of screening and confirmationtests may reflect the bulk purchasing power of laboratory service for alarge number of specimens and, therefore, may be applicable only to largeaviation companies. However, the FAA lacks clear and definitive data regardingthe extent to which ``economies of scale'' will affect or reduce costs.Although some commenters believe that the FAA failed to consider costsassociated with administration of the anti-drug program, the initial RegulatoryEvaluation and the FAA's total costs stated in the NPRM included theseadministrative costs.The figures in the NPRM were based on average industry costs availableto the FAA at the time of the NPRM. The FAA believes that the costs containedin the NPRM may closely equate to actual costs because the vast majorityof personnel subject to the testing requirements of the proposed rule,by a ratio of 10 employees of large companies to one employee of smallcompanies, are employees of large companies. Moreover, the FAA notes thatsmall Part 135 certificate holders and other small aviation companies oftenare associated with larger companies. The FAA believes that small aviationoperators could participate with large companies, much as these small companiescontract for maintenance, reservations services, gate agents of largercompanies, to conduct the required tests pursuant to the rules and, thus,take advantage of the economies of scale.Nevertheless, the FAA increased the estimate of drug testing costs in aneffort to respond to the concerns expressed by the commenters and to reflectthe potential testing costs incurred by small aviation operators. For thepurposes of the Regulatory Impact Analysis of the final rule, the costestimate of screening tests was increased to $25.00 per test; the costestimate of confirmation tests was increased to $35.00 per test; and theadministrative costs were increased to $35.00 per test.The FAA recognizes that broad rehabilitation programs would be very costlyand could be cost-prohibitive for small aviation companies. For a varietyof reasons discussed previously, the final rule does not require an employerto offer an opportunity for rehabilitation to employees and the FAA hasnot mandated a minimum amount of time that an employer must hold a positionopen while an employee is prohibited from performing sensitive safety-or security-related functions.In estimating the benefits that are expected to accrue as a result of acomprehensive anti-drug program, the FAA noted its lack of specific, availabledata in the NPRM. The FAA disagrees with the commenters who dispute theanalysis of benefits provided by the FAA in the NPRM and notes that a comparisonof the benefits determined by these commenters with the estimated costsof the rule would still result in a cost beneficial rule. No evidence isavailable to demonstrate that sole reliance on the data regarding deceasedgeneral aviation pilots is representative of the population of employeeswho are subject to testing under the provisions of the final rule.Infrequent and sporadic data is available in the commercial aviation sector.The FAA can not rely solely on information deduced from the two commercialaviation accidents discussed previously. The information does not revealany significant patterns that would assist the FAA's estimates of costsand benefits of the proposals and, in any event, this information is notgenerally representative of personnel who are not pilots but who are subjectto the requirements of the rule. For these reasons, the FAA believes thatit is appropriate to use the national NIDA study information to estimatethe potential costs of the rule because it more accurately reflects thebroad population of employees who would be tested pursuant to a comprehensivedrug testing program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Summary</ITAG>In accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12291, the FAA reviewedthe cost impact and benefits of this final rule. Cost factors were obtainedfrom information in the public docket including comments received duringthe FAA's public hearings. Additional data were furnished by air carriertrade associations, public institutions, and major chemical and drug testinglaboratories. This rulemaking does not meet the criteria of a ``major''rule under Executive Order 12291 because it is not likely to have an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more. A summary of the FAA's estimatesof the costs and benefits is provided below. However, because the rulemakingis a costly undertaking, the FAA considers the final rule to be a ``major''rule under Executive Order 12291. For this reason, the FAA prepared, andplaced in the docket, a Regulatory Impact Analysis of the final rule. Inaddition, because the rule involves issues of substantial interest to thepublic, the FAA determined that the rulemaking is significant under theRegulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation(44 FR 11034; February 2, 1979).<T3>Costs. </T3>The FAA estimated that the requirements of the final rule,over the 10-year period from 1990 to 1999, will cost approximately $240.3million in 1987 dollars (an average of $24.0 million per year) or approximately$135.2 million discounted over that 10-year period. The discounted costincludes (rounded to the nearest million) $97.1 million for random testing;$6.2 million for periodic testing, postaccident testing, testing basedon reasonable cause, and return-to-duty testing; $8.6 million for preemploymenttesting; $10.6 million for blind samples submitted to laboratories; $10.3million for EAP education and training cost; and $2.4 million for costsassociated with preparation and submission of an employer's anti-drug program.Costs of postaccident testing, testing based on reasonable cause, and return-to-dutytesting are included as part of periodic testing costs. The FAA used one-halfof one percent of the estimated population tested annually as the numberthat will be tested under one of these three circumstances. The analysisof these costs is set forth in the full Regulatory Impact Analysis (ExhibitA) included in the public docket.The final rule will affect 149 entities that hold Part 121 certificates,3,614 entities that hold Part 135 certificates providing scheduled andon-demand service, and contractors who provide services to those certificateholders. The rule also will affect an undetermined number of entities engagedin operations listed in andSection; 135.1(b) for compensation or hire. TheFAA has been unable to determine the exact number of these organizationsdue to the highly diversified and multipurpose nature of their operations.For purposes of analyzing the cost impact of the final rule on these entities,the FAA estimated that approximately 1,500 entities, the same number asrepair stations, are engaged in operations listed in andSection; 135.1(b)for compensation or hire. Based on these estimates, the FAA estimated that538,000 persons will be subject to drug testing in 1991 pursuant to therequirements of the final rule.The FAA estimated that the cost of an initial screening test for the presenceof drugs or drug metabolites will be $25 per test. The FAA expects that12.5 percent of initial screening tests will require confirmation testingin accordance with the guidelines and standards contained in Appendix Ito Part 121. Of the total initial screening tests, 7.5 percent are expectedto be confirmed as true positives; 5.0 percent are expected to result infalse positive test results after confirmation. The remainder are not expectedto be confirmed as positive either because the specimen failed to meetthe minimum threshold to be scientifically considered as positive, or becausethe specimen did not show the presence of drugs or drug metabolites. Confirmationtests are estimated to cost $35 per test. The FAA notes that an employercan realize substantial savings by contracting with a drug testing laboratoryfor a fixed price that includes the cost of initial screening tests andconfirmation tests rather than paying for these tests separately. For example,the Coast Guard currently pays a single, fixed price of $21 for screeningtests and any resulting confirmation tests under a single contract witha drug testing laboratory.The FAA estimated that a screening test will require 15 minutes of a person'stime to provide information for chain-of-custody forms and to provide aurine sample for drug testing. Thus, the FAA included a factor equal to25 percent of an average, fully allocated, hourly wage for each occupationalgroup covered by the final rule. The FAA also assumed that affected personswill provide urine samples for testing while on duty. The FAA included$35 per test as an administrative cost to cover, among other things, collectionof specimens, reporting and recordkeeping, and chain-of-custody procedurecosts. The FAA recognizes that these costs can vary significantly dependingon a number of variables. For example, specimens may be collected in amedical setting (i.e., in a hospital or a clinic, in the presence of medicaldoctors, nurses, medical technicians). Collection of specimens in a medicalsetting is not required by this rule. Less expensive settings and nonmedicalpersonnel trained for specimen collection may be used by the aviation industry.Collection sites may be either centrally located or dispersed throughoutremote geographical locations. DOT's drug testing program and the FAA'speriodic drug testing program illustrate the cost variations associatedwith specimen collection. DOT uses a contractor to collect specimens atvarious, dispersed locations throughout the country. DOT pays an averageof $123 for each specimen collected. Specimens collected as part of theFAA periodic testing program are collected by aviation medical examiners.Collection costs for periodic tests range from $10 to $45 per specimen.The FAA considered these costs when estimating the administrative costsof the final rule. After consideration of the cost variations, the estimatedadministrative costs are representative of the costs expected in the aviationindustry. The FAA increased the administrative costs contained in the NPRMon the basis of information submitted by commenters. The FAA believes thatthe aviation industry will find the most economical method of sample collectionand will do so at costs that most closely mirror the costs charged to theFAA by aviation medical examiners for collection of specimens for periodictesting.In the case of most postaccident testing, testing based on reasonable cause,and testing after return to duty triggered by refusal to submit to a testor failure of a previous drug test, the FAA assumed that collection costsfor these tests are the same as the collection costs for random tests.However, the FAA assumed that the cost associated with collection of asmall percentage of postaccident specimens would be $100 per test. TheFAA used this higher figure to address the probability that postaccidentspecimens may be collected at a remote accident site or a location otherthan a site that the employer routinely collects specimens. Conversely,specimens collected for testing based on reasonable cause or testing afterreturn to duty could be collected in a central location or at the samelocation where other specimens are collected pursuant to the requirementsof the final rule.<T3>Benefits. </T3>The FAA believes that three major benefits will resultfrom the promulgation of the final rule. First, benefits will accrue fromthe prevention of potential injuries or fatalities and property lossesdue to accidents attributed to neglect or error on the part of employeesperforming sensitive safety- or security-related functions whose motorskills or judgment may be impaired by drugs. Second, benefits will accruebased on the potential reduction in employee absences from work, lost productivity,reduced medical and insurance costs due to on-the-job accidents, and improvedgeneral safety in the workplace. Third, broad benefits in the developmentof air commerce will accrue from projected diminished drug use by commercialaviation employees, thereby increasing public confidence in the commercialaviation transporation industry.A review of the commerical aviation safety record shows that drug use mayhave been a cause or factor in only two recent aviation accidents. Oneaccident was in 1983 and involved an all-cargo operation. The second accidentwas in 1988 and involved a passenger operation. Both accidents have beendescribed previously in this rulemaking document. Drug use has not beenestablished as a definitive causal factor of either accident. In the absenceof readily-available statistical data depicting the extent of drug useby employees in commercial aviation and in light of the pernicious effectsof drug use, the FAA does not consider the existing safety record to bean exclusive and valid indicator of the threat to aviation safety posedby aviation employee drug use. However, allegations of drug use by thepilot and copilot of Continental Air Express Flight 2286 that crashed onJanuary 19, 1988, killing 9 people, reveal the significant and real potentialfor fatal aircraft accidents that may be related to the use of drugs incommercial aviation. In light of data regarding drug use by mechanics andrepairmen submitted in reponse to the ANPRM, the FAA also is concernedabout the potential for aviation accidents attributable to drug use bycommercial aviation maintenance personnel.The FAA estimates that $84.3 million in discounted benefits would resultfrom promulgation of the final rule if one accident attributed to drug-impairedperformance by an individual who performs a sensitive safety- or security-relatedfunction in commercial aviation, involving a narrow-body, three-engine,commercial aircraft carrying 133 passengers and 5 crewmembers, is preventedduring the 10-year period from 1990 to 1999 (Exhibit E). Although not claimedas a benefit in this Regulatory Impact Analysis, the benefits associatedwith the prevention of a single accident, during the 10-year period from1990 to 1999, would be considerably more if the accident involved a 4-engine,wide-body aircraft carrying 289 passengers and 19 crewmembers. In thisevent, discounted benefits would total $219.9 million.The FAA also attempted to estimate benefits of the final rule, other thanthose benefits that may result from the prevention of aircraft accidents,associated with diminished drug use by commercial aviation personnel orany drug-deterrent effect that would result from promulgation of the finalrule.These estimated benefits consist of improved employee productivity as aresult of drug use deterrence. A report released in 1987 by the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), entitled ``Strategic Planning for WorkplaceDrug Abuse Programs,'' reveals that drug and alcohol abusers are involvedin an additional 3.6 more accidents than nonabusers; file 1.5 additionalworkers' compensation claims than nonabusers; file 2.5 times more oftenfor sick leave of 8 or more consecutive days than nonabusers; and incur3 times the amount of normal medical costs than nonabusers. In the absence of pertinent data, the FAA assumed that the rate of druguse by the 538,000 covered aviation personnel is approximately the sameas the rate of drug use in the general population (e.g., 10 percent). TheFAA also assumed that the productivity of employees who use drugs is 95percent of the productivity of employees who do not use drugs. In order to be conservative in estimating the costs of the final rule,the FAA assumed that 7.5 percent of the covered aviation personnel wouldproduce test results that are confirmed positive for prohibited drug use.However, this estimate is premised on testing that produces optimum detectionrates and the fact that drug users may continue to use drugs despite implementationof a comprehensive drug testing program that includes unannounced testingbased on random selection. Realistically, the FAA expects that testingpursuant to the final rule will not achieve optimum detection rates andthat some drug users will cease to use drugs rather than face the consequencesof being detected by testing under the final rule. The FAA hypothesized that 1.0 percent of the affected aviation populationwill stop using drugs voluntarily in the face of a comprehensive drug testingprogram. These individuals are expected to continue to perform sensitivesafety- or security-related functions without the presence of drugs ordrug metabolites in their systems. As noted above, the FAA assumed thatdrug users are 95 percent effective at their jobs compared to employeeswho do not use drugs. Thus, the aviation industry would realize a 5 percenton-the-job productivity increase for each individual who ceases to usedrugs. Therefore, the FAA estimated that employee productivity gains of$97.3 million, or $54.3 million discounted over the 10-year period from1990 to 1999, will accrue to the aviation industry based on the reductionof illegal drug use and increased employee productivity (see Exhibit G).<T3>Benefit/Cost Comparison</T3>. The total cost of compliance with therequirements of the final rule is estimated to be $240.3 million in 1987dollars and $135.2 million, at a present worth discount rate of 10 percent,over the projected 10-year period form 1990 to 1999. The FAA has been unableto quantitatively estimate the accident prevention effectiveness of thefinal rule. Nevertheless, the FAA believes that drug use, unless stemmed,will continue to pose a threat to aviation safety. The FAA estimates thatpreventing one accident involving an average size, commercial, passengeraircraft during the 10-year period from 1990 to 1999 would result in discountedbenefits of $84.3 million. Likewise, discounted benefits ensuing from increasedemployee productivity are estimated to be $54.3 million. Thus, total discountedbenefits expected to result from promulgation of the final rule amountto $138.6 million. The benefit to cost ratio of the final rule is 1.03.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Determination </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires a Federal agency to reviewany final rule to assess its impact on small businesses. In considerationof the cost information discussed previously and included in the full RegulatoryImpact Analysis, the FAA certifies that the final rule may have a significantnegative economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Inan effort to relieve the burden on small entities, the FAA modified therequirements of the final rule and provided alternative schedules and implementationperiods directed solely at small aviation entities to provide some measureof relief from the costs associated with the rule. The FAA anticipatesthat these modifications will reduce burdens associated with the requirementsof the final rule on small entities without adversely affecting aviationsafety.   <ITAG tagnum="84">International Trade Impact Statement </ITAG>The final rule will affect only domestic operators and, therefore, willhave no impact on trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseasor on foreign firms doing business in the United States. It should be notedthat, unless compliance with this final rule would violate the domesticlaws of policies of a foreign country or a foreign government contendsthat application of the rule raises questions of compatibility with foreignlaws or policies, individuals employed at foreign repair stations undercontract to U.S. certificate holders would not be able to perform maintenanceor preventive maintenance work on U.S.-registered aircraft unless theyparticipate in an anti-drug program. Thus, foreign repair stations maybe affected economically. Likewise, this program also will result in anexpense to U.S. certificate holders operating overseas because these entitieswill be required to establish anti-drug programs, which will not be requiredof their foreign competitors. The FAA is unable to estimate the possiblecompetitive effect of these costs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Approval</ITAG>In order to ensure compliance and effectiveness of the final rule, theFAA included necessary reporting and recordkeeping requirements in theprovisions of the final rule. The final rule requires employers to maintainrecords related to employee drug testing and any rehabilitation and tosubmit periodic, written reports to the FAA that summarize an employer'santi-drug program. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980,the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the final rule have beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications</ITAG>The final rule adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. This rule preeempts any State or locallaw that would prohibit or limit drug testing required under the rule.This preemption, under the FAA's statutory authority, is essential to ensurethat the safety benefits are obtained throughout the nation's air transportationsystem. The rule also could have an indirect, economic impact on Stateand local governments, if persons who lose jobs as a result of a positivedrug test require welfare benefits or other public social services. TheFAA does not expect this impact to be significant, however. Therefore,in accordance with Executive Order 12612, the FAA determines that thisfinal rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantpreparation of a Federalism Assessment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>The final rule requires domestic and supplemental air carriers, commercialoperators of large aircraft, air taxi and commuter operators, certain commercialoperators, certain contractors to these operators, located in the UnitedStates or in a foreign country, and air traffic control facilities notoperated by the FAA or the U.S. military to have an anti-drug program foremployees who perform, either in the United States or in a foreign country,sensitive safety- or security-related functions. Testing under this finalrule will be conducted by an employer prior to employment, periodically,randomly, after an accident, based on reasonable cause, and after an employeereturns to duty to perform a sensitive safety- or security-related functionfor an employer. The final rule also will require that an employer provideEAP education and training services to employees and supervisors. The ruleis necessary to prohibit an employee from performing a sensitive safety-or security-related function for an employer while that employee has aprohibited drug in his or her system or if that employee has used drugsas evidenced by a drug test showing the presence of drugs or drug metabolites.The rule is intended to ensure a drug-free aviation workforce and to eliminatedrug use and abuse in commercial aviation. The FAA believes that the finalrule will reduce the potential for drug-related aviation accidents andwill foster identification of commercial aviation employees who use drugs.Pursuant to the terms of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the FAAcertifies that the final rule may have a significant negative economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. The final rule will notresult in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, butbecause the requirements of the final rule are important and costly undertakings,the FAA considers the final rule to be a major rule pursuant to the criteriaof Executive Order 12291. In addition, the rule involves issues of substantialinterest to the public; thus, the FAA determines that the final rule issignificant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Departmentof Transportation (44 FR 11034; February 2, 1979). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>14 CFR Part 61 Air safety, Air transportation, Aircraft, Aircraft pilots, Airmen, Aviationsafety, Drug abuse, Drugs, Narcotics, Pilots, Safety, Transportation. 14 CFR Part 63Air safety, Air transportation, Aircraft, Airmen, Airplanes, Aviation safety,Drug abuse, Drugs, Narcotics, Safety, Transportation. 14 CFR Part 65Air safety, Air transporation, Aircraft, Airmen, Aviation safety, Drugabuse, Drugs, Narcotics, Safety, Transportation.14 CFR Part 121Air carriers, Air transportation, Aircraft, Aircraft pilots, Airmen, Airplanes,Aviation safety, Drug abuse, Drugs, Narcotics, Pilots, Safety, Transportation.14 CFR Part 135Air carriers, Air taxi, Air transporation, Aircraft, Airmen, Airplanes,Aviation safety, Drug abuse, Drugs, Narcotics, Pilots, Safety, Transportation.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, the FAA amends Parts 61, 63, 65, 121, and 135 of the FederalAviation Regulations (14 CFR Parts 61, 63, 65, 121, and 135) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 61_CERTIFICATION: PILOTS AND FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS</ITAG>1.
