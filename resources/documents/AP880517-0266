The rift has the potential to slow progress in creating computerprograms that can run with little or no modification on a widerange of machines.   Pitted against ATandamp;T and its Silicon Valley partner, SunMicrosystems Inc., are giant International Business Machines Corp.and Digital Equipment Corp. as well as Hewlett-Packard Co., ApolloComputer Inc. and three European companies.   Top executives of the seven companies appeared at a newsconference today to announce creation of an Open SoftwareFoundation, which would create a computing standard independent ofATandamp;T.   IBM, Digital and the others believe ATandamp;T and Sun are exertingtoo much control over the operating system known as Unix, a layerof software that controls basic computer operations.   ATandamp;T invented Unix and licenses it to other computer makers foruse on their machines. The dispute is important because Unix isbecoming a major force in the computer industry, because of theease with which it runs on computers of different designs.   In a rare display of power, IBM Chairman John F. Akers, DigitalPresident Kenneth Olsen and Hewlett-Packard chief John Young madeappearances at today's news conference.   ``It's not every day we find so many heavyweights in the ring atthe same time,'' Young said. ``We all agreed to redefine the rulesof the next round of battle.''   The European companies that participated in the news conferenceare Siemens AG and Nixdorf Computer AG of West Germany and GroupeBull of France.   The companies will each contribute about $4.5 million a year tothe Open Software Foundation for the first three years, it wasannounced.   The seven computer makers are irked by the requirements ATandamp;Timposes on companies that license the latest version of Unix.Licensees must assert that they comply with certain ATandamp;T standardsfor the way their versions of the operating system hook intoapplications software, such as database managers.   As a last resort, if companies failed to bring their versionsinto compliance, ATandamp;T could revoke their Unix licenses.   Digital's Olsen said the Open Software Foundation was notintended to compete with ATandamp;T and said that ATandamp;T had in fact beeninvited to join.   But Robert Kavner, the new president of ATandamp;T's Data SystemsGroup, said in an interview today, ``If we did join, we would putUnix and the future of open systems in the hands of a foundationthat has inherent conflicting motives among its sponsors.''   Some critics of IBM and Digital have questioned whether IBM andDigital really want to promote an industrywide computing standard,since that could liberate their customers to buy other companies'computers and software.   Michael DeFazio, ATandamp;T's director of software systems, saidcomputer users and independent software developers are happy withthe company's efforts to ensure uniformity because it makes iteasier for them to run programs on a variety of machines.   DeFazio denied claims that ATandamp;T and Sun Microsystems wereworking to make sure that future versions of Unix worked best ontheir own computers.   ATandamp;T recently agreed to buy a stake of up to 20 percent in Sun,a Mountain View, Calif.-based maker of scientific and engineeringworkstations that has been moving into other segments of thecomputer industry.   The computer companies said the Open Software Foundation wouldcreate a new software ``environment'' that would go beyond anoperating system to standardize other aspects of the computer'ssoftware, including the way computers hook together in networks.   For a starting point, the new software will be based on IBM'sversion of Unix known as AIX. It will comply with standardsspecified by Posix, a project of the Institute of ElectricalEngineers, and X-Open, an international standard-settingorganization.   Posix stands for Portable Operating System Environment.   The seven companies in the Open Systems group are suspicious ofATandamp;T and its role in overseeing Unix, said Greg Cline, an analystfor the Yankee Group in Boston. But ATandamp;T is suspicious of thosecompanies, too, Cline said.   ``It's like verifying nuclear treaties on-site,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
