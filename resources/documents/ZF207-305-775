(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Jeffrey FrentzenandM;Pocket modems, a staple of the portable-computer and laptop crowd, aredesigned for those who must telecommunicate while away from the office.andM;All of these modems attach to a computer's RS-232C port and are roughly thesame size as a pack of cigarettes.andP;  When not in use they can be stored in abriefcase or, naturally, in your pocket.andM;Corporate users can dial into a local area network from a hotel room or phonebooth.andP;  Salespeople, service technicians and insurance adjusters use them tofile reports with the home office.andP;  Large newspapers like The New York Timesand news wire services like The Associated Press send reporters around theworld armed with portables and pocket modems.andM;Pocket modems also can be found on oil rigs, at construction sites, oranywhere a portable computer is used to transmit data to and from remotelocations.andM;Most of these pocket modems run on their own 9-volt battery, an importantfeature for portable-computer users who don't want to drain power from thecomputer's battery.andP;  The convenience of pocket modems is matched by theirprices, usually quite a bit less than that of their full-size desktopcounterparts.andM;A small, external modem makes sense for users of portables because of thelimited space and lack of expansion slots inside the smaller machines,according to Larry Cynar, a market analyst at Dataquest Inc., amarket-research firm in San Jose, Calif.andM;Pocket modems have advantages over conventional internal modems, which areexpensive and not interchangeable from system to system.andP;  An external pocketmodem, on the other hand, will work on any computer with a serial port andcan move with users who upgrade to the latest computer.andM;In phone booths and some hotel rooms, where a user cannot plug a modem intothe phone's RJ-11 jack, it may be possible to employ acoustic couplers with apocket modem.andM;''That might be a little cumbersome, but if you're stuck at an airport andyou simply have to communicate, it's a solution,'' said Jack Cohen, managerof domestic sales for pocket modem vendor Touchbase Systems Inc., ofNorthport, N.Y.andM;Not all is rosy with pocket modems, though.andP;  ''One major problem we had indeciding on [a pocket modem] was some of them didn't work coming off theshelf,'' said Bob Lisak, regional technical specialist at ISC, amanufacturing firm in Oak Brook Terrace, Ill., that installs and maintainscomputer systems for the banking industry.andM;ISC sends field-service representatives to installation sites to diagnoseproblems with its systems, using a pocket modem to tie in with the homeoffice's technical-support microcomputer.andM;According to Lisak, some pocket modems didn't use true Hayes AT commands.andP;  Healso had problems putting cable ends into some of them.andP;  More often than not,he claimed, it was the result of shoddy workmanship.andM;For very technical, application-specific uses, a simple pocket modem may notcome with enough features.andM;According to ISC and other users, service technicians who troubleshoot remotecomputer systems prefer pocket modems with a flashing LED status display, abuilt-in speaker and a low-power indicator.andP;  These allow technicians tomonitor whether the modem is on line or transmitting and whether the batteryis running low.andP;  Not all pocket modems have these features.andM;Most pocket modems operate at 1,200 bits per second, although the corporateworld is quickly adopting 2,400 bps as a standard.andM;''There are not many 2,400-bps products out there,'' said Cohen, ''but weshould see more of them this year.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
