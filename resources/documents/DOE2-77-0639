The two-dimensional lattice consistsof two different sorts of atoms which form regular sublattices. We findthat there is a gapless Cooper-pairing phase if one sublattice has arepulsive and the other sublattice an attractive electron-electron interaction.On the other hand, there is an antiferromagnetic phase with a gap ifthe interaction is only repulsive. Furthermore, we do not find coexistenceof Cooper pairing and magnetic ordering at T = 0.</TEXT></DOC>
