(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Global AreaandM;Global area networks (GANs) are poised to dominate data communication duringthe 1990s, particularly in large international organizations.andP;  A GAN iscomposed of linked LANs which ideally provide connectivity for allintracompany data communication.andP;  All computers are directly attached to theGAN, including PCs, Unix workstations, midrange processors, and mainframes.andO;Likewise, a GAN concurrently supports multiple communication standards, bothde facto and industry.andP;  All heterogeneous networks within a businessenterprise are fully integrated and are managed by local network managersthat report to one central network manager.andM;Linked LANs are built by connecting a group of LANs, which may be at the samelocation or separated by vast distances.andP;  The linked LANs form a singlenetwork that appears as one logical local area.andP;  A logical local area neednot be physically contiguous, like a LAN, and represents an extension of whathas normally been thought of as the LAN traffic's domain.andM;Initially, the linked LANs were placed inside a wide area network (WAN)infrastructure.andP;  Within the LAN-WAN-LAN architecture, the LAN and WANcomponents are clearly distinct.andP;  This type of architecture has offeredcomparatively primitive functionality for LAN-oriented data processing.andM;In the GAN architecture, the network appears as one component across bothlocal and remote linkages.andP;  Over time, enterprisewide computer architecturewill begin to focus more on the LAN and less on the WAN.andP;  LAN and WANdistinctions become hazy and perhaps will eventually disappear.andM;Global EvolutionandM;The stages of evolution from early LANs to embryonic GANs are fourfold:isolated LANs, multiple segment LANs, remotely linked LANs via WANs, andGANs.andM;Isolated LANs: Isolated LANs materialize early in the evolution of LAN-basedcomputing in the business enterprise.andP;  Because the LANs are not linked,connectivity among workgroups is limited to exchanging diskettes.andP;  Everyworkgroup has its own physical LAN which consists mainly of disk, file, andprint servers, as well as workstations.andM;Multiple cabling is in place for the different types of communication.andO;Workgroup processing justifies continued investment in LAN resources.andM;Multiple segment LANs: As LANS grow, the segments are bridged together.andO;LAN-based computing starts among workgroups and departments.andP;  Multipleprotocols begin to appear on the LAN.andP;  Some enterprisewide computing involvesmultiple protocol stacks when workgroups using different network operatingsystems want to share file server resources.andP;  Gateways to externalcommunications are implemented.andP;  Devices such as 3745 communicationcontrollers and 3174 control units attach directly to the LAN.andP;  Midrangeprocessors are also directly connected to the LAN.andM;Progressive user groups start to perform 3270 emulation over the LAN throughthe directly attached 3174s or 3745s, or via PC nodes and 3270 gateways thatemulate the LAN attached cluster controllers.andP;  The LAN adapter efficientlysatisfies all data communication requirements, so workstation slots becomeavailable for advanced graphical display adapters, co-processor boards, RAM,and so on.andM;All types of data communication are tied into the LANs through specializedgateways, such as, asynchronous, TCP/IP, and X.25 as well as the 3270terminal emulation.andP;  Some gateways function as communication servers.andP;  WANsare used for terminal emulation, cooperative processing, and file transfer.andO;Universal cabling is implemented on a widespread scale so that one cablingscheme runs all LAN-based communication, regardless of different networktopologies.andP;  Connectivity is the prime justification for LANs across theenterprise.andM;Remotely Linked LANs Via WANs: LAN administrators express strong interest inglobally linked LANs; the demand for efficient LAN-to-LAN computing amongremote LANs, anywhere in the world, rises out of the workgroups.andP;  Specificapplications that are key to the success of the business operation drive thatneed.andP;  Single protocol LAN-to-LAN bridges, point-to-point connections, moresophisticated gateways, and routers are used to funnel LAN traffic overexisting WANs.andP;  Different transmission systems are utilized.andP;  LAN-WAN-LANconnectivity proliferates into a &quot;many solutions&quot; scenario as workgroupsstrive for individual WAN-based configurations.andM;The WAN infrastructure appears to be fragmented, which hinders resourcesharing for external communications sharing for external communications andcreates ineficiencies.andP;  Overall operation of the communication resourceseventually becomes difficult.andP;  Associated operational costs are driven up asa result of duplication across workgroups and vendor-specific enterprisenetworks.andP;  Network management is decentralized, and for some, management doesnot exist at all.andP;  Although lightweight LAN-WAN-LAN processing can beaccomplished, the need for changes in the WAN environment becomes evident.andO;While connectivity remains the primary justification for LANs, an interest ininteroperability and integration of multivendor systems begins to arise.andM;GANs: This advanced network architecture unifies the infrastructure forlinking LANs.andP;  The links become largely protocol-independent; they supportmultiple protocol traffic via advanced bridge and router technology.andP;  TokenRing and Ethernet LANs share a common backbone.andP;  The formation of subnets isless heavily emphasized.andP;  Instead, homogeneous networks are extended to theirlimits.andP;  Interoperability and systems integration issues begin to overshadowconnectivity.andP;  Centralized network management covers all data communications.andO;Access control and network resource management become universal across allnetworks, including those supporting multivendor, heterogeneous systems.andM;The advance of complementary and supplementary technologies helps to nurturethe development of GANs.andP;  Those technological advances include economicalhigh speed communication links (cost-effective lines, more economical publicand private data networks, ISDN, dedicated fiber-optic links, etc.),andO;MAC-layer bridges, high-powered routers, and sophisticated network managementtools.andP;  Parallel advances occur in technology directed at business systems,such as database servers, distributed computing, and multiplatforminteroperable application systems.andP;  &quot;Super&quot; file servers present additionalnetwork computing horsepower, since worldwide processing places quite a loadon a single database server.andM;Global ManagementandM;Networks, regardless of their size or stage of evolution, must be controlledand monitored.andP;  Management is required for all networks.andP;  And, as networksbecome more complex, management must increase in sophistication.andP;  Somenetwork management is built into the network layer, data-link layer, andphysical layer protocols.andM;LAN adapters are the source of basic management information.andP;  Errorinformation is communicated through the layers of network architecture to thelayer that responds to the error condition and then tries to resolve it.andO;When recovery at the adapter level is not possible, an error report isforwarded to the network manager and network operating system.andP;  At thehighest level of network management, reporting errors takes the form ofnetwork alerts or events.andM;Without proper controls, standards, and monitoring tools, global support ofLANs is a nightmare for the network operations manager.andP;  Successful networkmanagement depends on network management tools provided by product vendors orthird-party developers, and on industry standards.andP;  End-user companies mustdecide whether the GAN will be managed with one standard integrated tool, orvia multiple tools integrated by the network vendor.andP;  The latter is not idealbecause custom programs often have to be written on patched each time newfeatures or components are added, or if changes are introduced by a productvendor.andM;GANs require a combination of centralized and local network management.andO;Local network managers monitor and control a specific LAN or LANs in adesignated domain; they are referred to as service points.andP;  Distributednetwork management allows for localization and/or regionalization that isbest suited for LAN support.andP;  All local network managers report to thecentral network manager.andP;  The central network manager views the entireintegrated network end-to-end and is referred to as the focal point.andP;  Ahierarchy of local/central network managers is an efficient means to monitorand control a large network.andM;Local network managers analyze and filter control information from their LANdomains.andP;  Only information pertinent to the focal point is forwarded from thelocal network managers to the central network manager.andP;  As an example, when aLAN node powers on its adapter, a local network manager registers the changebut does not communicate an event to the focal point (unless the localnetwork manager had been previously queried by the central network manager toforward that type of information).andP;  However, if a physical break occurs inthe LAN, the central focal point is immediately notified.andP;  Having diverseproducts among the locally managed networks puts greater emphasis on thecentral focal point to manage the differences, particularly in multivendor,heterogeneous network environments.andM;In isolated LANs, network management can occur from any workstation, server,or other LAN node.andP;  A centralized network management tool is not needed.andO;Multiple segment LANs require a dedicated local device for LAN management;there is centralized management for alerts and event notification only.andO;Typically, remotely linked LANs have local service points for eachhomogeneous enterprise network; those local service points communicate with acentral focal point.andP;  However, multiple central focal points exist becausethe networks are not fully integrated, but are separated into numerousenterprisewide networks.andP;  In GANs, local service points also represent allLANs.andP;  In addition, enterprisewide LAN architectures are fully integrated toform a single network that is centrally managed from one focal point.andM;Driving the GANandM;Economics, advancing technology, the way people relate to computer systems,and personal productivity enhancement catalyze the move towards GANs.andM;Tangible economic factors contributing to the rampant spread of LAN-basedcomputing include: dramatically reduced overall systems cost, much less timerequired to develop systems, increased flexibility for quickly coping withchange, and the promise of rapid advances in functionality over the nearterm.andM;Not long after PCs were introduced, connectivity in personal computing beganto spread via advances in LAN technology.andP;  More recently, LANs have been usedto leverage the possibilities of personal computing on a departmental,enterprisewide, and now global area network scale.andM;As a result of technological advancement, PC LANs have challenged mainframeand minicomputer architectures.andP;  LANs have eroded the long-term viability ofthe more traditional computer systems as a platform for business solutions.andO;Ironically, mainframes and minicomputers have since capitulated via their owndirect attachments to LANs.andP;  The unfolding of universal LAN attachment isrooted in the prospect that the most promising connectivity andinteroperabitlity solutions for the 1990s will be LAN-based.andP;  It is also anecessary condition for the evolution of GANs to take place.andM;The human appeal of PC LAN computing is one of the primary driving forcesbehind the spread of LANs and the inevitability of GANs.andP;  Simply put,business end users like PCs and LANs.andP;  This bottom-up approach is best suitedto satisfy the human as well as the business needs of computer end users.andO;With PCs and LANs, the users control the resource rather than beingcontrolled by it.andM;Personal productivity is especially enhanced via LAN-based PCs.andP;  Combinedincreases in personal productivity have magnified the overall productiviyy oforganizations.andP;  Prior to Pcs and LANs, the restrictions of conventionalsystems limited the potential leverage that could be realized via computersystem tools.andP;  Sometimes the results were worse than not having any comptersystem at all.andM;Today, it seems as though LAN-based systems are as close to perfection as wehave gotten in modern computing.andP;  It is no wonder then that LANs are nowcoming together on a worldwide basis to form GANs.andM;MIS OrganizationandM;The forces driving the evolution of LANs toward GANs have strainedconventional MIS organizations in large companies.andP;  A reorganization alonglines of data communication is needed to support and keep up with therapidlyadvancing technology.andP;  After reorgnization, the focus should be on keepingthe networks attuned to the business goals.andM;Departmental, enterprise wide, and global area networks should be integratedat the senior vice president level that reports to the chief informationofficer.andP;  A business unit LAN deployment committee helps to developshort-range implementation plans and then oversees network deploymentthroughout the company.andP;  It ties the technology group together with thebusiness unit workgroups and departments.andM;A technology planning committee has a much broader charter.andP;  Technical andnon-technical directions are set for technical planning, strategic andtactical research, assimilation of technology throughout the company, andorganization and management issues related to harnessing technology to theadvantage of the business.andP;  It contains representation from the businessunits and from important MIS components such as application systemsdevelopment, end user computing, and workstation development.andM;The departmental LAN technology chain of command addresses thebread-and-butter LANs of workgroups and departments.andP;  Via LAN implementation,support and training, this group is visible throughout the organization.andO;Much of the group's work is performed in the field at LAN sites.andM;Network infrastructure is the responsibility of the enterprise networksgroup.andP;  Operations management focuses on network monitoring and controlthrough local and central network management systems.andP;  Research forevaluation of new technological developments in data communication may betactical or strategic; however, the primary research thrust in the enterprisenetworks group is tactical.andP;  Problems related to systems integration,interoperability, support of multivendor and multiple architecture systemenvironments, and the interconnection of homogeneous and heterogeneousnetworks are important pieces of the research mission.andM;Vendor-specific experts are a part of the enterprise networks group.andP;  Thephysical layer specialists cover all standard and nonstandard cabling, cableplants, and low-level connectivity to GANs.andM;A GAN group coordinates all facets of GAN operation and support.andP;  The GANspecialists are involved in support and research.andP;  The LAN support groupwithin departmental LAN technology relies heavily on their technicalexpertise.andP;  GAN operations management works closely with enterprise networksoperations management.andM;Application DesignandM;Because GAN communication link speeds are less than the data rates found onLANs, special consideration must be given to application design in order toavoid bottlenecks that adversely impact throughput and degrade systemperformance.andM;Distributed computing architectures are the most suitable for the GANenvironment.andP;  The location of programs and databases affect the time requiredfor program loading and data access.andP;  Programs are best run locally ordistributed across numerous processors on the network.andP;  Program-to-programcommunication among multiple remote processors is an invaluable concept to beutilized.andP;  Application developers may also apply distributed architectures indatabase design.andM;Tom Gordy, senior marketing support representative at the IBM nationalmarketing and technical support center, categorizes the server's load ofremote access requests in terms of requests per minute (RPM).andP;  RPMs areworkstation I/O requests over the LAN that the server must satisfy.andP;  RPMsvary among different types of processing and use.andP;  Table 1 is a derivation ofGordy's RPM analysis, showing average RPM values for each type of user.andM;Server capacity typically varies between 10,000 and 30,000 RPMs depending onthe speed of the server's processor and disk access, network operatingsystem, type of file system, the nature of access (the mix of sequential andrandom file access), LAN adapter, server tuning, and other factors.andP;  Servercapacity has been the primary bottleneck in workgroup and departmental LANs.andO;(The RPM analysis shown in the table is for conventional file servers onlyand does not correspond to new advanced server architectures.)andM;With GANs, the communication link speed over which the requests travel fromremote workstations to access shared network resources are most often theprimary constraint.andP;  Another derivation of the load matrix is shown in Table2 with a communication link speed corresponding to each type of processingand use.andP;  The capacity and performance of each communication link is afunction of line speed.andM;Communication link speed varies significantly by processing type.andP;  The numberof users and type of processing and use determines capacity.andP;  Differentcommunication protocols also impact capacity differently.andP;  In Table 2, asubstantial number of users is assumed when establishing the appropriate linkspeed for each type of processing and use.andM;Office processing tasks, such as e-mail word processing, spreadsheetprocessing, and graphics, produce a relatively light load.andP;  Links of 9.6Kbpsto 19.2Kbps can each handle hundreds or even a thousand office processingusers.andP;  Even steady use does not produce much loading because most of thework is performed at the workstation.andP;  Programs are loaded off local servers,rather than through the GAN; this is also the case for interactive and batchprocessing.andM;Without any redesign considerations, office processing tasks are well suitedto the GAN environment.andP;  Concurrent use is not relevant, because in officeprocessing people pause to think, during which the user does not put any loadon the network.andM;Interactive tasks place a moderate load on the server and network.andP;  Theexception is the light load from casual interactive users.andP;  Communicationlinks of 19.2Kbpa to 64Kbps will each support more than 100 users performinginteractive tasks such as data entry and maintenance.andP;  Again, programs areloaded off local servers and data is accessed across the GAN.andP;  Steadyinteractive processing places more than double the load of steady officeprocessing on the servers and on the GAN's data communication links.andM;Multiple database updates in a distributed database environment use manycommunication links concurrently; this is an important consideration inapplication systems design.andP;  Nevertheless, concurrent use is still not anoverwhelming consideration in interactive processing, as it is in batchprocessing, even when many users are steadily accessing the data.andM;Batch jobs consist of reports, data queries that retrieve many data elements,database loading, backups and restorations of extensive datasets, filetransfers, software distribution, periodic processing such as accountingmonth-end closings, file searching, index creation, and data sorting.andP;  T-1 orfractional T-1 links are needed for interrupted and steady batch processing.andO;A single fractional T-1 link can support more than 50 users if theapplications have been designed properly.andP;  Casual batch processing does notimpose as much load and can be satisfied with 64Kbps links.andP;  Concurrency is avery important consideration due to the large amount of bytes transferredover the network by a batch processing job.andM;Batch processing is the greatest challenge is running applications over theGAN.andP;  Processing and I/O must be carefully distributed between local andremote system resources.andP;  Database servers can play an important role byprocessing the workstation's request at the server and then returning theresults to the workstation.andP;  As a result, GAN traffic is reduced.andP;  Otherdistributed processing and distributed database architectures should also betaken to maximum advantage.andP;  The objective is to offload the communicationlinks to ensure satisfactory response times and performance in processing.andM;Future DEvelopmentsandM;As networks continue to evolve and GANs mature, developments in networktechnology will expand capabilities and functionality.andP;  The developments willbe concentrated in network hardware and software components, bandwidthallocation and cost, multimedia integration, data handling, and networkmanagement.andP;  Industry standards, led by ISO's OSI and IBM's SAA, will propelsystem integration as interoperability becomes the rage of the 1990s.andM;The future scenario looks like the following.andP;  Faster, smarter bridging androuting nodes are widely implemented.andP;  Switching nodes perform multi-portbridging and routing with little internal subsystem delay.andP;  High speed,fault-tolerant communication superservers with multiple processors capable ofadvanced parallel processing handle many of the bridging, routing, filtering,and management functions.andP;  Moves and changes in the network configuration aredynamically possible while ensuring network and application systemsavailability.andP;  End users won't even notice that the changes are being made tothe network.andM;Multiport network devices support multiple physical layer connections tocommon high speed backbones, and also perform routing functions.andP;  FDDI hasbeen accepted as a standard for high performance work-ground LANs as well asfor local enterprise network backbones.andP;  A &quot;beefed up&quot; ISDN is a candidate tobe prime facilitator of connectivity in the GAN environment.andP;  Voice, data,graphics, image, and video are integrated at the workstation level.andP;  New datahandling techniques, such as data compression, prestored images on CD-ROM,and distributed data base architectures become commonplace.andM;The future of network management includes: remote GAN configuration; externalnetwork management interfaces to products such as IBM's NetView, NetCenter,and high-level network integration products based on SNMP; and expert systemsfor automatic decision management.andM;ConclusionandM;Today, the big challenge in GANs are cost of bandwidth, different states oftechnology at various locations throughout the world, dealing withinternational tariffs and local governmet restrictions, and integration ofnetwork management across heterogeneous environment of globally linked LANs.andO;The problems of networking in the United States for metropolitan and regionalarea networks seem tame by comparison.andM;Robert Panza is a LAN consultant affiliated with EJR Computer Assoc.,andO;Hobokan, N.J.andP;
