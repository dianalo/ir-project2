The separationof the loaded additives is done by filters. In order to manage with thesmallest possible quantities of additives with a high degree of cleaning,the additive supply is set via a control loop with a comparison of reference/actualvalue. The actual value is measured with a harmful substance detector,which is situated before the controlled additive supply in the directionof flow of the uncleaned or partly cleaned stack gas.</TEXT></DOC>
