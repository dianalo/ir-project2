It was the 13th time this year that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has assigned management of a savings and loan to a new concern, a step that keeps the beleaguered Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. from having to pay out any funds.    The Bank Board said Investors Federal, with assets of $97.8 million, was insolvent and had substantially dissipated its assets. It also said that the thrift, under the direction of its former president, Earl Meyer, had violated federal laws and regulations involving documentation, loans to directors and conflicts of interest. No charges have been filed, however. Mr. Meyer couldn't be reached for comment.    The new institution, Investors Savings andamp; Loan Association, will begin operations today as a federally chartered mutual association in the same offices as Investors Federal. Investors Federal was a stock association.    Sunwood Management Corp., a subsidiary of Parker, Colo.-based Sunwood Corp., will manage the new Sandamp;L under a contract approved by the Bank Board.    According to the Bank Board, Investors Federal in 1983 began purchasing and originating participation interests in large commercial real estate developments and other commercial loans. A major cause of the association's downfall, the Bank Board said, was its involvement with Savings Investment Service Corp., a statewide organization from which Investors Federal bought a large number of participating interests. </TEXT></DOC>
