Jewish settlers urged eventougher polices in the occupied lands, where 12 weeks of violencehave cost at least 76 Arab lives.   The peace mission of Secretary of State George P. Shultz raninto trouble. Sources said Jordanian leaders, who believePalestinians are entitled to their own negotiating team, rejectedtalking with Israel as part of a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, military commander of the West Bank,said Israel has four times as many soldiers there as it did beforeriots began Dec. 8. In keeping with army policy, he gave no figures.   The latest deaths brought to 76 the number of Palestinianskilled, according to U.N. figures, most of them shot by Israelisoldiers. Hundreds have been wounded.   Israeli measures to quell what Palestinians now call ``theuprising'' have been criticized abroad. Prime Minister YitzhakShamir said Monday those who censure Israel from outside ``like tosee us beaten and hate to see us defending ourselves with force andremaining alive.''   ``Nations which said nothing when we were brought to theslaughterhouses are now going wild when they see rioters receivingtheir due punishment,'' he told reporters in northern Israel.``It's hard to understand the injustice in these reactions.''   Some Cabinet members have said journalists should be banned fromthe occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Shamir did not rejectthe idea. ``If it becomes clear that indeed it may limit thedamage, I would be willing to consider it,'' he said.   Jewish settlers distributed 3,000 leaflets in Palestinian towns,working overnight to avoid clashes with Arabs, that warned of toughIsraeli action against Arab agitators.   ``Don't be mistaken enough to think we are turning the othercheek,'' said the leaflets from the nationalist group Gush Emunin.``The days when Jewish blood was cheap are long gone, as is the dayof the slogan `Slaughter the Jews.' Don't mistake our intention. Weare staying here forever.''   Gush Emunim urged Israel to impose emergency laws in the WestBank and Gaza, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the1967 Middle East war. About 1.5 million Palestinians live in theterritories.   Noam Arnon, spokesman for Gush Emunim, said: ``Anyone who liftsa rock ... puts his life on the line. The Arabs have to be toldthis. We don't have to wait until, God forbid, Jews will be burnedin a bus. We must do this now.''   Hospital officials said two Palestinians were wounded by gunfirein the Gaza Strip and 50 Arab women and children threw stones atsoldiers in the West Bank city of Ramallah, taunting them withchants of ``We are the PLO!''   Troops used tear gas and fired shots into the air in Ramallah,and arrested two young Arabs, Associated Press photographer MartinCleaver said.   In Burin, a West Bank village of about 1,400 three miles southof Nablus, 50 Palestinians attacked an army jeep with stones andiron bars, the army said. The report said soldiers fired tear gasand rubber bullets to no effect, then used live ammunition andYasser Daoud Eid, 18, was fatally shot in the neck.   The second death Monday was of Mahmoud Batwi, 30, who died of agunshot wound to the head suffered four days earlier during aprotest in Jenin, a West Bank town.   Two Jewish settlers suspected of killing two Arabs on Saturdaywere freed on bail. Also released were four soldiers who were shownin a CBS News videotape to be beating two Palestinians for morethan half an hour near Nablus last week. Authorities saidinvestigations would continue in both cases.   Hananiya Schneider, 45, and Moshe Bahagon, 37, both of the NeveTzuf settlement, were released on bail of 2,500 shekels each (about$1,500).   They are suspected of killing the two Palestinians in Abud afterresidents of the village barricaded the main road.   At Kibbutz Gesher in northern Israel, home of one of thesoldiers involved in the beating, friends and relatives of Sgt.Saguy Harpaz, 20, accused Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of givingambiguous orders to young soldiers.</TEXT></DOC>
