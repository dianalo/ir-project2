But in a message sent to Bush in Washington, the Palestinianleader did not rule out talks between Israel and Palestinians``under the right conditions,'' Israel radio said.   The radio did not say how it obtained a copy of the message,which it said was marked ``classified.'' The radio's Arab affairsreporter read a Hebrew translation of the message.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said on Tuesday that Bushhad received a message from Arafat ``in the last couple of days,''but he refused to divulge its contents. ``It was a private messageand was sent orally in order to keep it private,'' Fitzwater said.   In the message, Arafat said an increasing number of Palestiniansbelieve Israel is not seriously searching for a political solution,according to the radio report.   ``This is creating an atmosphere that rouses the radicalsagainst the moderates, and it makes it difficult for us to keep upthe hopes of our people. Patience is waning,'' Arafat was quoted assaying.   ``The Palestinian nation believes the United States' obligationto Israel's security should not prevent it from acting with abalanced policy that takes into account the legitimate rights ofthe Palestinian nation and the needs of both sides of theconflict,'' Arafat reportedly said.   ``A more aggressive attitude by the U.S. toward Israel wouldraise our hopes ... all the while goading Israel to adopt areasonable stance,'' he was quoted as saying.   In the message, Arafat said Israel's plan for elections in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip is really aimed at establishing abody to replace the PLO, the radio reported.   ``Understandably, our people in the occupied territories areaware of this Israeli tactic and will foil every Israeli attempt toachieve this goal,'' Arafat was quoted as saying.   Israel's Foreign Ministry refused to react to the message orspeculate on how it may have been leaked to Israel radio.</TEXT></DOC>
