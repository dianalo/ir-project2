One was very famous; the other wasn't. The famous one was Vladimir Feltsman, the 35-year-old Russian-Jewish emigre who was just granted an exit visa after eight years of internal exile. Mr. Feltsman's Carnegie Hall recital attracted curious music lovers as disparate as Mike Wallace and Nancy Reagan. The First fan was kept away by an unseasonable blizzard in Washington, but Ron Reagan Jr. did brave snow and paparazzi to attend. Weather was also foul the previous night, when Anton Nel performed at Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln Center, but it is doubtful that the Reagans or Mr. Wallace were kept away by the freezing rain or had even heard of Mr. Nel.    This is not to say that he has spent his 25 years in a cloak of invisibility. He is this year's winner of the prestigious Naumburg Award, and winner of the 1986 Johanna Hodges Competition in California. In addition, he took prizes at the Leeds International Competition in England, and the Pretoria International Piano Competition in South Africa. This last is most crucial, for Mr. Nel is a native of South Africa, politically one of the least fashionable places on earth to hail from nowadays.    Even so, the crowd that braved a miserable storm to hear him bespoke the importance of the occasion. It wasn't a packed house, but it was definitely a professional one: A good number of pianists as well as a healthy representation from the arts-management and public-relations world had turned out for this second appearance of the new boy in town (who made his formal New York debut at Carnegie Recital Hall in January). Moreover, it was one of the quietest, most attentive audiences in recent memory -- no coughing, no candy wrappers, not even one digital watch alarm. Briefly, Mr. Nel gave as good as he got, and that was mighty good.    Haydn and Scarlatti sonatas gave him a chance to display fluency and taste, but in the ripsnorting romantic repertoire Mr. Nel breathed fire. David Del Tredici's &quot;Virtuoso Alice&quot; (1984) couldn't have received a better world premiere. A Lisztian transcription of the composer's tender &quot;Acrostic Song&quot; in &quot;Final Alice,&quot; it is rich and satisfying, and Mr. Nel brought to it every nuance of coloration, rubato and lyricism. Afterward he tossed off Saint-Saens's sweeping D-flat &quot;Etude en Forme de Valse&quot; with the kind of virtuosity that used to make salon audiences swoon, while his fine interpretation of Schubert's &quot;Wanderer&quot; Fantasy was greeted with genuine warmth.    Mr. Nel, who currently heads the accompaniment department at the University of Texas at Austin, appeared with the Chicago Symphony at the Ravinia Festival this summer, and already has 30 concerts lined up as well as tours of Spain and South Africa, according to Lucy Mann of the Naumburg Foundation, which will continue to keep him under its wing until he secures professional management. Obviously he is at the beginning of a promising career, and when management takes over one presumes that his appearances will be heralded by more than the one-page press release that was sent me.    Contrast this with the nearly half a pound of press material sent out on Mr. Feltsman: press releases and clippings (several showing Mrs. Reagan embracing the pianist after his White House appearance in September while the president mouthed a few platitudes), photocopies of the Congressional Record transcript of Congressman Jack Kemp's Feltsman speech in the House, the letter on Mr. Feltsman's behalf from four members of Congress to the ambassador of the U.S.S.R., testimonials from Sir Yehudi Menuhin, Helen Hayes and Dudley Moore (dating from the mock American debut arranged for him in absentia by a stellar group of supporters in 1982), and the congressional resolution that Mr. Feltsman be granted his &quot;freedom to travel with his family to the U.S. to perform.&quot; Obviously a powerful PR machine was already working overtime before the pianist set foot on American soil. Who, one wonders, has been footing the bill for all this flag-waving hype?    Regardless of the jingoism, Carnegie Hall was the place to be Wednesday night, and when Mr. Feltsman appeared on stage, it was a stellar crowd that greeted him, including Mikhail Baryshnikov, conspicuously seated in the &quot;royal&quot; box. In a way, Mrs. Reagan's absence was fortunate, for had she been there the pianist might have felt obliged to start with a few variations on &quot;Yankee Doodle.&quot;    Instead, he chose a well-rounded program that enabled him to prove he's been well worth the trouble. If Mr. Feltsman seemed to strive for clarity at the expense of energy in Schubert's gentle &quot;Sonata in A-Major,&quot; he put all doubts to rest with a resounding, polychromatic interpretation of three movements from Olivier Messiaen's &quot;Vingt Regards sur L'Enfant Jesus&quot; (1945). Here he unveiled a walloping technique handled with the control of an athlete, and when he subsequently finished a brilliant reading of Schumann's long and fiendish &quot;Etudes Symphoniques,&quot; the audience rose to its feet to consecrate the new star in the Western sky.    Throughout the evening, Mr. Feltsman displayed sincere love for the music he played, as well as genuine personal charm. One hopes, therefore, that audiences will appreciate him for his uncommon artistry, and that the PR machine will quickly stop using him to clap good old democracy on the back. Mr. Feltsman plays heroically, but one doubts he wants to play the hero.    ---   Mr. Scherer is a free-lance music writer based in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
