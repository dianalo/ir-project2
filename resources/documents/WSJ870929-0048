After a weekend marked by a full-scale media barrage -- last-minute leaks, newspaper excerpts and television reports -- Simon andamp; Schuster, a Gulf andamp; Western Inc. unit, shipped 601,000 copies to retailers in sealed trucks. Charles Hayward, vice president and publisher of Simon andamp; Schuster's trade unit, says the company is so encouraged by initial orders that it now expects sales of &quot;VEIL: The Secret Wars of the CIA, 1981-87&quot; to reach one million copies.    That would give it blockbuster status by nonfiction standards. Simon andamp; Schuster declined to say how much Mr. Woodward received for the book, but publishing industry sources estimated he received about $1 million.    The book is retailing at $21.95; publishers typically pocket about 10% of the gross, meaning Simon andamp; Schuster would net $2.2 million on the hardcover alone if it does sell one million copies. An audio cassette with excerpts recorded by Mr. Woodward is due out shortly, and the Book of the Month Club purchased it as a main selection, which should further spur sales.    A big dispute centers on the veracity of Mr. Woodward's claim that late CIA Director William Casey admitted in a deathbed confession that he was aware of the diversion of funds to Nicaraguan rebels in the Iran-Contra affair. Mr. Casey's widow, Sophia, disputed that claim over the weekend, telling the Associated Press the account is a &quot;fabrication&quot; and that no such meeting ever took place.    In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Woodward said he stands by his story. &quot;I have a lot of respect for Mrs. Casey, and this is obviously part of what she feels she has to do,&quot; he said. &quot;But she's disputing something when she wasn't there -- I was.&quot;    The author's allegations have also caused some controversy in journalistic circles, with some editors questioning the Washington Post Co.'s apparent decision to let him sit on the story about his meeting with Mr. Casey until the Post and its sister publication, Newsweek, ran excerpts this week from the book for which they had bought exclusive rights.    Mr. Woodward said he kept the Post &quot;fully informed&quot; of his actions and said his strategy was necessary to fully develop the story. Benjamin Bradlee, executive editor of the Post, dismissed the issue. &quot;Bob Woodward has had 58 bylined exclusive pieces in the last twelve months&quot; about the Iran-Contra affair, Mr. Bradlee said, adding that no other newspaper scooped what was in the book in the meantime. &quot;You read it all in the Washington Post first, eventually,&quot; he said. &quot;But apparently that isn't enough for some people.&quot;    Anthony Marro, editor of Newsday, which ran excerpts yesterday from the Washington Post syndicate, said &quot;as an editor I'd rather have had it in the paper as soon as we knew it.&quot; But he added that the Post was probably making a special case because of its relationship with Mr. Woodward, author of &quot;All the President's Men,&quot; &quot;The Brethren,&quot; and &quot;Wired.&quot; Newsday covers the New York and Long Island region.    Despite Simon andamp; Schuster's unusual measures to keep the book under wraps, and its exclusive serialization agreement with the Washington Post and Newsweek, a leak popped Friday when U.S. News and World Report announced that it had obtained the galleys. The magazine, which appeared on stands today along with Newsweek, issued a news release and analysis revealing some of the book's disclosures. Networks and wire services quickly picked up the reports, and the Washington Post pushed its publication of the excerpts to Sunday from yesterday as originally planned.    Newsweek officials said they weren't worried about the U.S. News piece, which is a two-page synopsis and isn't mentioned on the cover of the magazine. Newsweek, by contrast, contains an 18-page illustrated feature, and its cover trumpets &quot;Exclusive Book Excerpts: The Secret Wars of the CIA by Bob Woodward.&quot; Maynard Parker, editor of Newsweek, said it might have sought legal remedy had major excerpts appeared a week earlier. But, he said, the U.S. News piece &quot;is nothing more than a great teaser for anyone who wants to read the excerpts in Newsweek, and a giant promotion for our edition.&quot;    Simon andamp; Schuster said it has no idea how the book was leaked and that its attorneys are reviewing the U.S. News material. However, legal sources said it is unlikely the company will take any action. </TEXT></DOC>
