Begin and the other surviving architect of th historic treaty,former President Jimmy Carter, praised the pact but expressedregret that it did not lead to a comprehensive settlement of theArab-Israeli conflict.   Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the pact assassinatedEgyptian President Anwar Sadat four years after he signed it.   There were no official ceremonies marking the occasion,reflecting the chilly relations between the two former Middle Eastadversaries, mainly over the lack of a solution to the Palestinianproblem.   Israeli students did, however, sponsor a ``peace party'' at aconvention center in Jerusalem to mark the occasion of the signingof Israel's only peace treaty with an Arab state.   No official ceremonies were held in Egypt either, and only onegovernment- controlled newspaper mentioned the anniversary.   Columnist Anis Mansour wrote in the al-Ahram newspaper thatalthough Arab countries accused Egypt of treason when the treatywas signed, they now agree on the need for negotiations topeacefully end the conflict.   Israel's army radio broadcast interviews with U.S., Israeli andEgyptian politicians and even played Egyptian music and Hebrewpeace songs that led the pop charts a decade ago.   The 75-year-old Begin took issue with Washington's latest peacemove, the U.S. dialogue with the Palestinian LiberationOrganization in Tunisia that broke a 13-year American boycott ofYasser Arafat's organization.   ``This is in my opinion a negative, harmful phenomenon,'' hesaid in his characteristically hoarse voice. ``The Americans, ourfriends, are in essence asked to reconsider this matter.''   Begin said he opposed formation of a Palestinian state in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as ``a danger to Israel and theentire Middle East.''   He complained that Palestinians persisted in clashing withIsraeli soldiers in the occupied lands and sending guerrillas toraid northern Israel.   ``If this isn't terror, it is difficult to know what terroris,'' he said, referring to Arafat's renunciation of terror andrecognition of Israel's right to exist that led to the Americansopening up a dialogue with PLO.   The uprising in the occupied lands is now in its 16th month andmore than 400 Palestinians have been killed in the revolt, most byarmy gunfire at stone-throwing youths. Eighteen Israelis also havebeen killed.   Referring to the treaty with Egypt, Begin said: ``I have thefeeling we achieved something very important, peace.''   Begin, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Sadat, reportedlybecame depressed over the death of his wife Aliza and Israel'slosses in the Lebanon war. He resigned suddenly in 1983 and haslived in seclusion ever since.   Carter was one of a half-dozen international figures connectedwith the 1979 treaty interviewed on Israel radio on the anniversary.   Carter, 64, applauded the peace agreement's survival throughpersistent Middle East violence, noting especially that it was notupset by Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.   ``Both sides have courageously complied with the terms of thepeace treaty,'' said Carter, who negotiated the accords at CampDavid in Maryland between Begin and Sadat in September 1978.   The following March 26, the three men signed the Israeli-Egyptpeace treaty on the White House lawn.   But Carter said he regretted that the peace pact did not spurother accords with Palestinians and Israel's Arab neighbors.   ``My expectations and hopes and dreams were that building uponthe principles established in the Camp David accords, that we wouldsee a fairly rapid series of bilateral talks or negotiationsbetween Israel and her neighbors, including the Palestinians,''Carter said in an interview broadcast on Israel's army radio.   The Camp David accords offered a wide-ranging framework forsettling the Arab-Israei conflict, calling on Israel, Jordan andEgypt to help negotiate a resolution of the Palestinian problem.   They called for a five-year period of autonomy for Palestiniansin the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as an interim solutionbefore a final settlement was negotiated.   ``That principle has not changed. I think it is still a goodprescription for the future,'' said Carter.   Palestinians rejected the plan at the time because it failed toguarantee them an independent state or a negotiating role for thePLO, still key issues in the dispute today.</TEXT></DOC>
