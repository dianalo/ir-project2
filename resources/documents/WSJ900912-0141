Analysts said an article in a German publication, OilWorld, reported that world soybean meal consumption betweenJanuary and September reached an all-time high. Soybean mealoften is used as feed for poultry and cattle and is acomponent of many foods produced for human consumption.</LP><TEXT>   Purchases of soybean meal by the Soviet Union, generally abig buyer, have been somewhat smaller than usual, so anoverall increase in world soybean meal use would be doublysignificant, analysts said. &quot;Even without the Soviets,consumption was up, so the market took that to be a veryencouraging sign,&quot; said Anne Frick, soybean analyst forPrudential-Bache in New York.   The effect of increased demand for soybean meal on futuresprices was heightened by diminishing world production ofsoybeans, particularly by soybean growers Brazil andArgentina. The market also reacted to a U.S. AgricultureDepartment crop ratings report released late Monday thattraders said showed hot weather in the Mississippi Deltagrowing region had hurt the developing soybean crop. &quot;Thatconfirmed a general decline in yield prospects for the U.S.crop,&quot; said Mario Balletto, soybean analyst for Merrill Lynchin New York. One Chicago weather forecaster's Mondayprediction of possible frost in the northern Midwest thisweekend appeared to be isolated; no other forecasts mentionedfrost.   Other factors influencing the market yesterday includedspeculation on the contents of an Agriculture Department cropproduction report due out after trading today. Most analystsexpect the department's soybean crop estimate for the 1990growing season to be practically unchanged, perhaps downslightly to about 1,835,000,000 bushels from last month'sfigure of 1,836,000,000 bushels. Because of the past twoweeks' hot, dry weather in the South, traders will adjust thedepartment's crop figures downward. So it will be hard forthe report to exert anything but upward pressure on futuresprices, analysts said.   Underlying the two days of price rallies in soybeanfutures is persistent speculation that the U.S. may offercredit to the Soviet Union for grain purchases from U.S.farmers. However, analysts downplayed rumors that such apackage would be announced soon. &quot;President Bush has other,more pressing issues in front of him,&quot; one analyst said.Though Middle East tensions didn't play a major role inyesterday's soybean futures price increase, analysts saidevents there will continue to support grain futures pricesgenerally as long as the region is in a crisis.   The soybean futures contract for November delivery rose 61/2 cents a bushel yesterday to settle at $6.3875 a bushel.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices closed lower yesterday inmoderate trading marked by a late sell-off. &quot;Aggressivebuying on expectations of military action {in the PersianGulf region} late yesterday and earlier today&quot; pushed priceshigher, said John Hill, a broker at Merrill Lynch FuturesInc. Technical factors provoked additional buying, but as theprice approached $32 a barrel, interest dissipated. Octoberlight sweet crude finished trading at $30.76 a barrel, down54 cents. Activity was fairly light, with traders showinglittle conviction. The only piece of fresh news to affectprice levels yesterday came around midafternoon when the U.S.Defense Department said Iraqi troops were observed movingalong that country's border near Syria and Turkey. While aspokesman for the Defense Department said hostilities weren'tthought to be imminent along those borders, crude oil futurespopped to intraday highs. They later declined, however. Andprices are unlikely to get a boost from inventory statisticsreleased by the American Petroleum Institute late yesterday.The figures showed that all oil stocks -- crude, gasoline andheating oil -- increased last week.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices were steady. The most activelytraded December contract ended with a gain of 0.25 cent apound at $1.2855. However, the soonest-to-expire Septemberdelivery, which is reflecting concern over relatively smallsupplies of copper available for delivery against a largenumber of outstanding contracts, rose one cent a pound to$1.3480. The stronger advance for September widened thepremium for that month over December by 0.75 cent to 6.25cents. Strong speculative demand for futures contractsdeveloped in London. &quot;It was well absorbed and had littleimpact, price-wise, on the market. As a result, New Yorkfailed to move much also,&quot; an analyst said. Negotiationscontinued in the mine strike in Peru and speculationcontinued that the dispute may be settled this week, analystssaid.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed, with gold andsilver rising while platinum continued weak. Decemberdelivery gold ended with a gain of $1.80 an ounce at $386.60.December silver advanced two cents an ounce to $4.87. Octoberplatinum dropped to a new life-of-contract low, $448.50, forthe second consecutive day, then partially recovered tosettle at $452.80, down $4.70. What support there was in goldwas mostly derived from a rally in crude oil from its lowsearly in the session, according to one analyst. He noted thatgold was also helped when the dollar late in the day gave upsome of its gains. Platinum's industrial character is workingagainst it, especially with the slowing U.S. economy, theanalyst said. A great disappointment to traders, he said, wasthat the Middle Eastern crisis has failed to touch off anysignificant investor buying of platinum in Japan, where it isthe favorite precious metal.</TEXT></DOC>
