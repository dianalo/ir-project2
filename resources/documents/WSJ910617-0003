Officials said Finance Minister Theo Waigel's revisedfiscal package now is set for legislative approval Fridayafter ceding to pressure for more federal funding for easternGerman states. The upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat,which is dominated by the Social Democrats, previously hadblocked his plan to raise taxes on income and petroleumproducts.</LP><TEXT>   To get the Social Democrats, or SPD, behind the Julypackage, Bonn agreed to allot 4.5 billion marks ($2.51billion) more for modernizing eastern German roadways through1993. The government also agreed to extend its 12% easternGerman investment subsidy by six months, or until July 1992.Bonn also agreed to delay the introduction of wealth andmanufacturing taxes in eastern Germany until 1993 and tocoordinate a future corporate tax overhaul with theopposition party.   Despite the concessions, the new taxes will bringadditional proceeds of more than 15 billion marks this year,according to Finance Ministry spokesman Karlheinz von denDriesch.   &quot;There was a power play by the SPD, but we can live withthe compromises,&quot; Mr. von den Driesch said. He explained thatBonn can now limit federal borrowing to 66 billion marks thisyear, to 50 billion in 1992 and to 40 billion in 1993.   Ahead of the Friday talks, Mr. Waigel argued that withoutthe new taxes the 1991 federal borrowing could swell to morethan 80 billion marks, further straining German capitalmarkets. Looking further ahead, Mr. Waigel said Germany's 14%value-added tax is to be raised to at least 15% in January1993.   Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger, who is tosucceed the departing Karl Otto Poehl as Bundesbank presidentAug. 1, criticized the government for relying only on highertaxes to cover the growing costs of eastern Germany'sreconstruction. He also warned against generating more costlyinvestment programs.   &quot;State benefits for investments in eastern Germany havereached a level at which further increases can hardly bepossible,&quot; Mr. Schlesinger warned in a speech to chemicalindustry officials.   Economics Minister Juergen Moellemann provided a glimpseat the sums involved over the weekend. He said Bonn's&quot;Aufschwung-Ost&quot; eastern German recovery program so far hasreceived applications for a total of 50 billion marks ininvestment aid, of which 13 billion marks have already beenapproved.   The Bundesbank's Mr. Schlesinger said the public sectortransfer to eastern Germany this year alone could total 140billion marks. More money doesn't necessarily create morejobs, he said, adding that higher government borrowingrequirements could discourage private investment. He alsorebuked Germany's trade unions for discouraging privateinvestment by aggressively driving up wages in easternGermany's underproductive industry.   Tax increases &quot;cannot remain the only instrument of fiscalpolicy,&quot; said the Bundesbank president-designate. Hereiterated the Bundesbank's pressure on Bonn to cuttingindustry subsidies in western Germany as a way of reducingdeficits.   Economists estimate that Germany's total public-sectorborrowings, including federal, state and municipalauthorities, could exceed the projected 1991 figure of about150 billion marks after totaling 100 billion marks in 1990and only 26 billion marks in 1989, before unification.</TEXT></DOC>
