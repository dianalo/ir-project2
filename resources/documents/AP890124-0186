(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A minister facing damaging testimony fromJessica Hahn, the woman who brought down PTL evangelist Jim Bakker,pleaded guilty Tuesday to reduced charges before the start of histax evasion trial.   The surprise decision by Eugene Profeta to plead guilty to two of18 state charges against him came just before Hahn, his formersecretary, was to testify during an evidence suppression hearing.   Profeta, of Long Island, admitted in court that he tried to getHahn to lie to grand jurors investigating his financial dealings andto filing a false 1986 income tax return.   He declined comment after he and his wife, Glenda, left thecourtroom. State prosecutors agreed to drop charges against Profetathat he skimmed funds from his Massapequa church for personal useand to drop income tax evasion charges against his wife.   ``He's a wimp,'' Hahn said of Profeta at a news conferenceoutside the courtroom. ``He couldn't say that `I made a mistake' andbecause of that I lost my family. You know, I've paid a price. Andby the grace of God I've been able to turn it around.''   The former church secretary, whose 1980 sexual encounter withBakker led to the downfall of his PTL ministry, became a celebrityand posed nude for Playboy magazine in the wake of revelations abouttheir liaison.   Hahn, who worked as a secretary for Profeta both before and afterthe encounter with Bakker, also said she had an affair with the LongIsland minister. She had earlier said she turned to him for solaceafter the Bakker incident.   At the evidence suppression hearing Monday, a New York stateinvestigator testified that Hahn told him she received $12,000 fromPTL in what ``sounded like extortion'' and that she spent $7,000 oncocaine.   A tearful Hahn admitted to reporters Tuesday that she``experimented with cocaine'' and tried to hurt Bakker by taking$12,000 from the PTL ministry in exchange for a promise not to talkabout their sexual encounter.   She said she tried to give the money back, but that PTL officialsrefused to relinquish a signed document saying she wouldn't talkabout the sexual encounter.   Hahn refused to say how much money she spent on cocaine.   ``It was a hard time in my life,'' said Hahn, now seekingemployment as a disc jockey. `` ... I'm not using anything now. Thiswas just a three-month period in my life.''   Under the plea bargain agreement, Profeta is to be sentenced tosix months in jail and five months' probation, pay a $5,000 fine and$13,000 in back taxes. He also was ordered by state Supreme CourtJustice Joseph Harris to stay away from Hahn.   Hahn testified before a grand jury investigating Profeta andtaped telephone coversations with him in exchange for the state'sagreement not to prosecute her.   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams called Profeta's pleabargain agreement appropriate.</TEXT></DOC>
