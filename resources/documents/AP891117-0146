Almost since its creation in 1985, FADA has been the target ofharsh criticism from members of Congress who charged that thefederally owned, but privately controlled, financial institutionhad grown into a bloated, inefficient bureaucracy mired inpolitical favoritism and inside dealing.   Legislation enacted Aug. 9 ordered a new agency, the ResolutionTrust Corp., to sell FADA if it could, or dissolve it if itcouldn't.   The $3 billion portfolio of loans and real estate managed byFADA will revert to the government.   The RTC was offering to sell FADA's offices in Washington, LosAngeles, Atlanta, Denver and Dallas, and its computer system andoffice furnishings. However, regulators were unwilling to sell theagency's name, charter as a financial institution, cash or rightsto asset management contracts.   Steven Seelig, RTC director of FADA oversight, said the threebids received for FADA all had conditions attached that made themunacceptable. One bidder, for instance, wanted to retain assetmanagement contracts but also have the right to buy the assets, aviolation of the RTC conflict of interest policy, he said.   The three bidders were J.E. Robert Companies, an Alexandria,Va., real estate management firm; NCNB Texas National Bank, Dallas,and Real Estate Advisory Services Corp., Denver.   FADA's 275 employees will be offered jobs with the RTC or withthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Seelig said a few highly paidsenior employees of FADA may opt to quit when the dissolutionbecomes effective at the end of January rather than accept a job atgovernment pay.   Previously, the FDIC announced it would try to sell $428 millionin FADA-managed properties in a block. The package includes 150properties located in Texas, California, Colorado, Arizona andFlorida.</TEXT></DOC>
