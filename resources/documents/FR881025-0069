Thisdocument corrects the editorial errors and omissions in that notice. Thecorrections to be made are to change the case number designation to CAC-004instead of CAL-004, the addition of the DOE letter to Mr. Marco Goldishof Airlex, and the Airlex requests for Interim Waiver and Petition forWaiver dated August 24, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC October 14, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John R. Berg,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Secretary, Conservation and Renewable Energy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">September 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Mr. Marco Goldish,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20"/><T3>President, Airlex Industries, LTD., 216 Charles Street, Hackensack,NJ 07601</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">Dear Mr. Goldish: This is in response to your August 24, 1988, Applicationfor Interim Waiver, from the Department of Energy (DOE) test proceduresfor central air conditioners when testing Airlex's ductless split systemheat pumps model series ERA/S-RC/RH.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended, theDepartment has prescribed test procedures to measure the energy consumptionof certain major household appliances, including central air condtioners.The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure ofenergy consumption that will assist consumers in making purchase decisions.These test procedures appear in the Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFRPart 430, Subpart B.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">DOE amended the test procedure regulations on September 26, 1980 (45FR 64108) and November 26, 1986 (51 FR 42823). These provisions allow theAssistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy to waive temporarilytest procedures for a particular basic model when a petitoner shows thatthe basic model contains one or more design characteristics which preventtesting of the basic model according to the prescribed test proceduresor when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model ina manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption characteristicsas to provide materially inadequate comparative data. The 1986 amendmentsprovide that an interim waiver from test procedure requirements will begranted by the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energyif it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardshipif the application for interim waiver is denied, if it appears likely thatthe petition for waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretarydetermines that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grantimmediate relief pending a determination on the petition for waiver. Paragraph430.27.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Department finds that the design of the Airlex model series ERA/S-RC/RNcannot be rated using the DOE test procedures. This is caused by a designfeature which disengages the heat pump and switches to electric resistanceheat when the outdoor temperature falls below 40anddegrees;F. The absenceof a defrost control system and the inability to operate the basic modelfor the low temperature test at 17anddegrees;F and the frost accumultationtest at 35anddegrees;F makes rating the unit with the current test proceduresimpossible. For this reason DOE believes that the Airlex Petition for Waiverwill be successful.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Airlex expressed economic hardship in its correspondence caused bythe inability to import models already produced, its investment in inventoryof materials on hand, and its outstanding orders. The DOE definiton ofeconomic hardship for granting an interim waiver requires that the manufacturerdemonstrate an adverse impact on the company caused by the inability tosell its product for the time required to process the petition for waiver.DOE believes that the information provided by Airlex satisfies the requirementsof economic hardship.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, Airlex's Application for an Interim Waiver requesting relieffrom the DOE test procedures for its ERA/S-RC/RH series ductless splitsystem heat pumps is granted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This interim waiver shall remain in effect for 180 days form the dateof issuance or until the Department of Energy issues a determination onAirlex's Petition for Waiver, whichever occurs first.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This interim waiver is based upon the presumed validity of the statementsand allegations submitted by the applicant. This interim waiver may berevoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basisunderlying the application is incorrect.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">  Yours truly,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.
