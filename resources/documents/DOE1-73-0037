Intraarterial carbon dioxide injections weremade in celiac artery (3 patients), common hepatic artery (6 patients)and proper hepatic artery (9 patients including right and left hepaticartery) using standard 5 French angiographic catheter or 6 French ballooncatheter. In all patients, hand injections were made with 30 {similar_to}50 ml plastic syringes that were filled from a small medical grade carbondioxide tank using a standard oxygen regulator. The carbon dioxide injectedinto the hepatic artery flowed more rapidly than iodine contrast material,showing a very rapid retreat from the blood stream, but the carbon dioxideflowing into the tumor vessel remained longer than within normal hepaticartery. Relative good demonstration of hepatic artery was obtained byCO/sub 2/-IADSA; in 13 of 18 patients, tumor vessels were distinctlyvisualized. In 9 of 11 patients with hepatoma, arterioportal shunt thatcould not be observed by conventional angiography were demonstrated.All of these patients, intrahepatic metastasis were found and their lesionslocarized in the portal segment flowed out by carbon dioxide. Side effectsto this technique included mild heat sensation (3 patients) and mildabdominal discomfort (2 cases), but no serious complication was exhibitedin any cases. We concluded that CO/sub 2/-IADSA was a safe angiographictechnique and would be a useful method for hemodynamic investigationsof hepatic tumors.</TEXT></DOC>
