Cadbury also rejected any management role for General Cinema, a Chestnut Hill, Mass.-based concern with interests in soft drinks, movie theaters and specialty stores. General Cinema's performance in its soft-drink business is &quot;unimpressive,&quot; Dominic Cadbury, Cadbury's chief executive officer, contended in an interview. He added that he didn't see what General Cinema might contribute to Cadbury.    Cadbury executives and investors are questioning the motives behind General Cinema's Cadbury holding, disclosed earlier this week. Reflecting the market's uncertainty, Cadbury stock has fluctuated in a narrow range this week. Yesterday it was quoted at the equivalent of $3.43 in London Stock Exchange trading, down from $3.49.    The U.S. company has said that it bought the shares strictly as an investment. But with its surprise disclosure Monday, General Cinema didn't lay &quot;the right foundation for the friendly and constructive relationship you say you are seeking,&quot; Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman, wrote to Richard Smith, General Cinema's chairman, according to Cadbury.    In Chestnut Hill, a General Cinema spokeswoman reiterated that the company views its stock purchase as &quot;a long-term investment.&quot; She said the company hasn't changed its plan to acquire as much as 25% of Cadbury this year, despite Cadbury's statement.    She noted that General Cinema hadn't proposed an &quot;investment with involvement,&quot; -- the phrase it sometimes uses when it seeks representation on a corporate board and a chance to suggest actions to management.    Dominic Cadbury, Sir Adrian's brother, initially said he was reassured by General Cinema's record of making long-term investments in a &quot;positive and constructive way.&quot; But in yesterday's interview, he said he had reached a different conclusion after studying the American company more closely. &quot;They need deals to produce results, and I don't want to see Cadbury Schweppes in the role of a deal maker,&quot; he said.    Dominic Cadbury noted that General Cinema attached conditions to a promise to keep its stake at 25% or less for a year. The U.S. company said its promise could be affected by &quot;any material change in circumstances affecting our investment.&quot; The Cadbury chief executive declared, &quot;This puts us on our guard.&quot;    Mr. Cadbury said he hadn't talked with Mr. Smith, currently on vacation. &quot;He didn't leave a phone number.&quot;    Analysts at Wood Mackenzie andamp; Co., a London stockbroker, speculated that General Cinema may want to persuade Cadbury to split off Cadbury's U.S. soft-drink business. In the U.S., Cadbury owns Sunkist and Canada Dry beverages as well as its well-known mixers, and holds a 30% stake in Dr Pepper Co.    If a contest for control develops, Cadbury's defense probably would rest on its performance and prospects compared with General Cinema's. Mr. Cadbury said that General Cinema's bottling expertise represents a different set of skills than Cadbury needs in world-wide brand management. &quot;I don't see that they have anything to contribute to the party,&quot; Mr. Cadbury said.    Mr. Cadbury wouldn't discuss 1986 results, which the company plans to report March 5. However, Wood Mackenzie analysts believe that pre-tax earnings in 1986 gained 37%; these anaylsts are forecasting a further 25% gain in 1987's pre-tax profit. The company is expected to benefit from a new British soft-drink bottling joint venture with Coca-Cola Co., the leader in the British soft-drink market.    Cadbury can mount at least one other line of defense: growing British political concern about the ill effects of mergers. BTR PLC, a British industrial conglomerate, recently dropped a bid for glass maker Pilkington Brothers PLC, after the proposed acquisition sparked controversy in Parliament. Mr. Smith &quot;has got to take account of political sensitivities&quot; that are sure to be raised by the appearance of &quot;creeping control of a major British company,&quot; Mr. Cadbury said.    General Cinema, the largest movie theater chain in the U.S., expanded into bottling in the 1960s, and is now the nation's biggest independent Pepsi-Cola bottler. In its recently issued annual report, executives noted that its beverage sales have &quot;consistently increased at rates well above that of the industry.&quot; and analysts consistently rank General Cinema among the steadiest growth companies in the U.S.    ---   William M.
