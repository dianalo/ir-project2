The O-2 observation plane was shot down by rebel rifle fireTuesday near the town of Ozatlan, 88 miles southeast of thecapital, killing the pilot, the army said.   The rebel clandestine Radio Venceremos said the plane _ thesecond downed in the past month _ was shot down as it was firingrockets at rebel position.   An A-37 jet fighter-bomber was similarly shot down by the rebelsNov. 18 in the eastern province of San Miguel.   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front broadcast said therebels have damaged 23 government aircraft during a new offensivethey launched Nov. 11, but the claim could not be independentlyverified and military sources refused to confirm or deny it.   Government planes recently have been forced to fly low andsuffer greater exposure to automatic weapons fire after the rebelswere supplied with Soviet-made SAM-7s and other surface-to-airmissiles.   President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government accusedNicaragua of supplying the Salvadoran guerrillas with the rocketsafter several of them were found in two small aircraft that crashedin El Salvador on Nov. 25.   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government neither confirmed nordenied the accusation and Cristiani suspended diplomatic relationswith Managua.   Except for one bus that police said was set afire, the capitalremained free of violence Wednesday for the first time since theoffensive began.   The army said fighting occurred overnight and early Wednesdayaround Zacatecoluca, 35 miles southeast of the capital, where threerebels were killed, and on the slopes of El Rosario mountain, sixmiles to the southwest, where two guerrillas and two soldiers werekilled.</TEXT></DOC>
