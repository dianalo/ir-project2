<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-1047 </DOCNO><TEXT>Proposals for high intensity proton synchrotrons (typically providing100 {mu}m (6 x 10/sup 14/ p/s) at 30 GeV) are being made in the U.S.A.,Canada, Europe and Japan. These beams would be roughly 100 times moreintense than those available now and would yield equivalent increasesin the fluxes of secondary particles (kaons, pions, muons, antiprotons,hyperons and neutrinos) - or cleaner beams for a smaller increase influx. The ability to investigate rare processes on the &quot;precision frontier&quot;opens new avenues to fundamental questions in both particle and nuclearphysics, complementary to traditional approaches via the &quot;energy frontier&quot;.The demand for higher currents had led to novel features in many of theaccelerator designs: asymmetric magnet cycles, separate collector andstretcher rings, beam painting at injection, bucket-to-bucket beam transfer,avoidance of crossing transition, perpendicular biassing of ferrite,and the use of Siberian Snakes. Other characteristic features includebooster stages, rapid cycling rates, H/sup -/ injection, low impedanceenclosures, powerful feedback systems for control of beam instabilitiesand beam loading, and local collimation and fast abort systems for handlingbeam loss.</TEXT></DOC>
