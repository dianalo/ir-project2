Law enforcement officers, meanwhile, made plans to head off anypotential confrontations between the two groups.   As many as 2,000 demonstrators were expected to march in theseven-mile ``Walk for Racial Equality,'' which is planned to endtwo miles from the Aryan Nations compound, site of the conferenceof neo-Nazi youths.   Sheriff's deputies and officers from the Idaho State Police andCoeur d'Alene Police planned a show of force around the anti-racismmarchers to discourage confrontations.   ``We've established what we feel to be tactics that are going toensure the safety of all the parties involved,'' said Capt. TomDickson.   Fewer than 100 neo-Nazi youths were believed to be staying atthe 30-acre ranch of Richard Butler, founder of the Church of JesusChrist Christian, Aryan Nations, a white supremacist organizationthat wants to turn the Northwest into a ``whites only'' homeland.   Butler said white supremacist leaders, including Ku Klux Klanofficials, will speak and conduct workshops.   Sheriff's deputies set up checkpoints Friday on roads leading tothe camp a few miles north of Coeur d'Alene to checkidentifications of people entering the area.   Lisa Anderson, organizer of Citizens for Nonviolent ActionAgainst Racism, the Coeur d'Alene-based group sponsoring the march,said she expected few problems.   Although the march has been endorsed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson'sRainbow Coalition, The New Jewish Agenda and Washington Gov. BoothGardner, groups such as the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rithwere staying away.   Marvin Stern, regional ADL director in Seattle, said his groupwas concerned about placing an additional burden on law enforcementand a potential for violence.   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus also refused to endorse the march,saying it could promote violence and give the neo-Nazis morepublicity.   In a statement issued Friday, Andrus lashed out at the skinheads.   ``The people of Idaho stand united against hate groups and thosewho would spread a message of fear and intolerance,'' he said.   Leaders of organizations formed during the past decade to combatthe Aryan Nations planned a picnic and other events a few milesaway from the white supremacist gathering.   ``We think that a march just does them too much honor andrespect,'' said Norm Gissell, chairman of the Kootenai County TaskForce on Human Relations.</TEXT></DOC>
