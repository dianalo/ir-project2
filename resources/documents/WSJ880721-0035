The order, which was expected, is a big boost for Airbus Industrie, the consortium that builds the plane. Air Canada, which is owned by the Canadian government, chose the A-320 over aircraft made by St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Seattle-based Boeing Co.    Last month, an Air France A-320 crashed at an air show, killing three people and injuring 50 others. Pierre Jeanniot, Air Canada's president and chief executive officer, said aviation experts assured him that the A-320 itself wasn't at fault. French officials said the plane was flying too low.    The A-320 will replace Air Canada's aging fleet of 34 Boeing 727 aircraft, which will be phased out over the next five years. The contract is Airbus's first with Air Canada, which currently operates only U.S.-built aircraft in its 110-plane fleet.    The airline also took an option for 20 additional A-320s, which could be converted to a stretched version of the aircraft.    The order was announced only after approval of Air Canada's capital spending program by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's cabinet. But this will likely be the last time that Air Canada's equipment plans will require a political decision.    Earlier this week, Canada's House of Commons approved a government-sponsored bill that would result in a public offering of a 45% stake in Air Canada, once the measure is passed by Canada's Senate. Air Canada's Mr. Jeanniot has said proceeds of the offering will be used to help finance the A-320 purchase.    The airline also will use internally generated funds and other public and private financing for the transaction. Mr. Jeanniot said the airline expects proceeds of between C$200 million and C$300 million from the sale of its existing 727 fleet.    Airbus Industrie is owned 37.9% each by Aerospatiale of France and Messerschmidt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, 20% by British Aerospace PLC and 4.2% by Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.    The aircraft will be equipped with the CFM 56-5A engine jointly produced by Snecma S.A. of France and General Electric Co. Delivery of the aircraft, which will carry 137 passengers each, will begin in March 1990 and continue until 1993.    The Airbus order had been one of several transactions involving France and Canada that appear to have been stalled in recent months, in part due to a dispute over fishing rights involving St. Pierre, a tiny French territory off Newfoundland.    For example, the Canadair Inc. unit of Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. has complained that its proposed agreement with Aerospatiale to supply parts for Airbus has been stalled by the fishing dispute.    A Bombardier spokeswoman said the parts contract, valued at as much as C$1 billion over 10 years, isn't linked to the Air Canada order, but she said that the airline's choice of the A-320 &quot;won't hurt.&quot;    Canada is also expected to decide soon between a British and a French design for its C$8 billion plan to build nuclear submarines, although Canadian officials have said the choice isn't linked to the fishing dispute.    Last week, Air Canada ordered three Boeing 767 extended-range aircraft in a transaction valued at C$200 million. The aircraft are in addition to four extended-range 767s ordered last year and 14 other conventional 767s already operated by Air Canada.    In Seattle, a Boeing spokesman said the aerospace giant was disappointed with Air Canada's decision to buy Airbus planes instead of the package of 737-400s Boeing offered. The 146-seat 737s &quot;would have provided proven technology and considerable Canadian content,&quot; the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
