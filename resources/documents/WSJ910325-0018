The latest sign of this confusion occurred over theweekend. William Genoese, the New York-based head of theunion's airline division and a candidate for Teamsterspresident, said he was fired by William McCarthy, the union'spresident. He called the firing part of a continuing McCarthypurge of those who have opposed the Teamsters president, andsaid Mr. McCarthy &quot;is destroying the organization.&quot; Mr.McCarthy couldn't be reached for comment.</LP><TEXT>   There are now six declared candidates for presidency, twoof whom have been fired by Mr. McCarthy, including his ownexecutive assistant. The Genoese firing and chargesconstitute another episode in a series of firings, charges,countercharges and lawsuits that have punctuated Teamstersactivity since court-appointed officials began overseeing theunion in 1989 as part of a settlement of racketeering chargeswith the Justice Department.   &quot;It's democratic pressure -- they can't handle it,&quot; saidKenneth Paff, an official of the Detroit-based Teamsters fora Democratic Union, a dissident group. TDU is backing RonaldCarey, head of a large local in New York's Queens borough,for the union presidency.   Also under the 1989 consent decree, delegates picked bythe rank and file will nominate Teamsters officers at theunion convention in June of this year, and the union memberswill elect the officers by secret ballot in December.Previously, the officers were picked by local union leadersat the convention.   Mr. McCarthy, who was a Teamsters vice president for NewEngland, outmaneuvered Weldon Mathis, the secretary-treasurerand the No. 2 man in the union hierarchy, for election aspresident in 1988. Mr. McCarthy succeeded Jackie Presser, whodied in July of that year, as head of the 1.4 million-memberTeamsters, which is the AFL-CIO's biggest union and thenation's second largest.   Turmoil in the union has heightened in recent weeks.Frederick Lacey, the courtappointed administrator for theTeamsters, filed a report criticizing Mr. McCarthy for givinga $3.6 million magazine printing contract to his son-in-law.Mr. Mathis then led an attempt to set a meeting for theunion's board to conduct an inquiry into the matter, whichcould have resulted in Mr. McCarthy's ouster. But the attemptfailed.   Opponents to that attempt included R.V. Durham, aTeamsters vice president from Greensboro, N.C., who isrunning for president with Mr. McCarthy's backing, and whoserunning mate for secretary-treasurer is Mr. Mathis. Mr.Durham said in an interview that he wanted to get a legalopinion about the Lacey report, instead of trying &quot;to do anumber&quot; on Mr. McCarthy.   Meanwhile, vice presidents Joseph Trerotola of New York,Daniel Ligurotis of Chicago and Walter Shea of Washington,D.C., filed a lawsuit against Mr. McCarthy, for firing themas heads of the union's Eastern and Central conferences, andas his top assistant, respectively. Mr. Durham said the judgedismissed the suit.   Mr. McCarthy fired Mr. Shea after Mr. Shea said he'll runfor president, following Mr. McCarthy's decision last Octobernot to seek re-election. Messrs. Ligurotis and Trerotola arerunning mates on Mr. Shea's ticket. Other declared candidatesare Lou Riga, a local president in San Jose, Calif., andJames P. Hoffa, who is son of former Teamsters chief James R.Hoffa but is considered ineligible because he hasn't been aunion official long enough.   Meanwhile, Mr. Durham seems on his way to lining up amajority of the 1,900 delegates who will nominate Teamstersofficers. But Mr. Carey has won about 200 delegates so far,including most of those picked by Mr. McCarthy's own local inBoston, according to TDU's Mr. Paff.</TEXT></DOC>
