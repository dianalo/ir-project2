The latest evidence appeared Monday, when Howard Kaskel, a wealthy New York developer, disclosed that he had purchased a 7.9% stake in Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., a railroad and data processing concern, and said he would be interested in acquiring the company.    Mr. Kaskel, whose family owns a chain of hotels, apartments and office properties, is unlikely to be the last big developer to move into stocks.    &quot;I can only tell you that we are actively involved in looking at a number of public acquisitions,&quot; says Bruce Eichner, a big Manhattan developer.    Tishman Speyer Properties Inc., a prominent developer, and Mendik Co., one of the biggest owners of Manhattan commercial property, are others looking for attractive stocks.    &quot;It's difficult to find good deals in real estate,&quot; explains Jerry I. Speyer, president of Tishman-Speyer. Mr. Speyer, citing uncertainties in the leasing market, recently tabled plans to go ahead with a new office building on the west side of Manhattan.    Jimmy Kuhn, a Mendik official, says he is looking for stocks of companies that own undervalued real estate. &quot;We think of it as buying wholesale,&quot; he says. &quot;With the Japanese coming in and prices (in Manhattan real estate) out of whack, we're all looking for opportunities.&quot;    The trend isn't limited to Manhattan developers. But within the real estate industry, New Yorkers have the most money to spend. Forbes magazine's list of the 400 wealthiest Americans includes 26, including Mr. Kaskel, whose money is principally derived from New York City real estate.    And, given the sharp rise in land values here over the past decade, many developers are uncertain about continuing to invest. &quot;People are afraid to start big developments now,&quot; says one developer. &quot;You don't want to get caught with a lot of square feet on your hands.&quot; Tom Lavin, a managing director and real estate specialist of First Boston Corp., says some developers are more comfortable reinvesting profits in stocks than in risky, long-term real estate projects.    The most prominent stock player among developers has been Donald Trump, who has netted an estimated $150 million from the market over the past 18 months. Mr. Trump sold his stake in Bally Manufacturing Corp. to the company at a premium; he made a big profit from trading Allegis Corp. stock; he won control of Resorts International Inc.; and he recently purchased a stake in Golden Nugget Inc.    Mr. Trump, however, continues to be active in real estate, and he questions whether the stock market is still attractive. &quot;Prices are very, very high,&quot; he said. &quot;The stock market is very heavily played right now.&quot;    Traditionally, developers have shied away from stocks &quot;because the market has never recognized the value of real estate,&quot; says Veronica Hackett, an executive vice president with New York-based Park Tower Realty Corp. &quot;The stock market looks at earnings. Real estate is cash flow.&quot;    Many developers operate family-owned companies that prefer to avoid the spotlight of going public. &quot;Most real estate people I know want to stick to what they think they know best,&quot; says Ms. Hackett.    But that attitude is changing. Last year, the Fisher brothers, a traditional New York development family, made a big profit in CBS Inc. stock, and Detroit developer Alfred Taubman made an unsuccessful attempt to take over Pulitzer Publishing Co.    Mr. Eichner, a first-generation developer, says some of the interest in stocks is sparked by a new breed of real estate concerns. Previously, he notes, developers often stuck to one mold; they were residential builders or mall developers.    Today, Mr. Eichner says, &quot;it's wherever the opportunities are. A lot of the people here (at Eichner Properties Inc.) have backgrounds in corporate finance. We've made a decision to go in that direction as the prices of pieces of dirt have risen.&quot;    Mr. Kaskel won't comment on his purchase of Kansas City Southern stock, beyond what he has said in Securities and Exchange Commission filings. He runs an empire founded by his father, Alfred, in the 1930s, and is said in real estate circles to be a private, family-oriented man. &quot;He doesn't have the personality of a raider,&quot; one developer said.    Mr. Kaskel continues to be active in real estate; he now is completing a condominium project in New York. However, sources close to the developer say he has been seeking to diversify. </TEXT></DOC>
