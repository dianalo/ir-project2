The purpose of theirdevelopment placed stress on power performance, low fuel consumption,safety, pollution, light weight, durability. dependability, and commonusage of parts. Concerning the structures, the cylinder head is an unificationtype of 5 cylinders and the cooling between valves adopts a drill-holesystem with the forced water circulation between valves so that enoughdurability may be secured. As for the cylinder block, in order to makeit light in weight while increasing the rigidity for the low pass noise,the structure analysis by FEN and the demonstration with actual machineswere conducted and the most adequate configuration of rib wall thicknesswas obtained. The wet method was adopted for cylinder liner. Furthermore,attention was drawn especially to the major motion system, crankshaft,the motion valve system and gear train, the induction system, the lubricationsystem, the cooling system and the fuel injection system, and the originallyintended quality could be achieved.
