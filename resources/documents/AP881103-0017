WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The case of a 20-year-old woman who served as asurrogate mother for her own mother has lifted the veil off athriving business of artificial procreation in Italy and spurreddemands for tighter controls on the practice.   The case, possibly the first of its kind in the world, has alsoraised difficult ethical questions and provoked protests fromdoctors, politicians and the Vatican.   And while Italy has no laws governing surrogate motherhood, theepisode has prompted a criminal investigation to determine which ofthe two women was registered as the legal mother of the child.   The affair involves a woman who carried to term the artificiallyinseminated egg of her 48-year-old mother. The egg was fertilized bythe sperm of the daughter's 35-year-old stepfather and implanted inher uterus.   The arrangement was disclosed in an Oct. 21 program on state-runRAI television. The two women and the man appeared on the show withtheir faces concealed to protect their identities, and their nameshave not been revealed.   The young woman gave birth to a boy at a Rome clinic days afterthe program was broadcast, newspapers reported.   Initially, newspapers and some doctors expressed doubts overwhether such an episode occurred. But most became believers when aRome gynecologist, Severino Antinori, said he performed theprocedure.   The mother, who had three children by an earlier marriage,explained on the program that her new husband wanted to havechildren but that she was advised by doctors not to have more babiesbecause of a uterus condition.   The couple went to Antinori, who proposed they adopt a child.But, after consulting among themselves, the family members returnedand proposed the daughter act as surrogate mother.   The RAI program immediately touched off a debate in medical andreligious circles over the ethical issues, including whether thewoman who gave birth is the child's mother or sister.   ``By his act, Antinori has shattered the meaning of the wordsfather, mother, child and even grandchild,'' said Eolo Parodi,president of the Italian Doctors' Federation.   On Oct. 29, the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano denouncedthe case in a front-page editorial.   ``The young woman was painfully used as an object,'' the papersaid. ``She was used for nine months as an incubator, a prisoner ofthe egotism of the mother and of the detestable techniques.''   The gynecologist defended himself and the family.   ``The uterus was not rented, but only donated, like a kidney, forfree,'' Antinori, 43, told Italian newspapers. ``Genetically, thesituation is very clear: the ovule is that of the mother, the spermis that of her husband, and the uterus is that of the daughter whoagreed to lend it.''   ``It's time for civil society to face up to the problems raisedby the new biotechnologies without hypocritically burying one's headin the sand,'' he said.   The case raised the question of who is the child's legal mother.According to Italian law, the woman who gives birth must beregistered as mother, but the older woman said on the program sheplanned to declare herself the mother.   A state prosecutor has opened an investigation to determinewhether the law was violated, a crime punishable by five to 15 yearsimprisonment.   In the United States, a landmark February ruling by the NewJersey Supreme Court in the so-called Baby M case outlawed surrogatemotherhood for pay.   The court granted custody of a child born under contract to thenatural father, but restored parental rights to the mother. A lowercourt later granted the mother, Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, graduallyexpanded, unsupervised visitation with the child.   The outcry over the Italian case has led to the first widespreadpublic examination in the country of artificial procreation,including the more ordinary techniques that have been growing inpopularity in recent years.   Luigi La Ratta, president of the Italian Association forDemographic Education, a non-profit organization that deals withfamily planning issues, said there are 50 public and private spermbanks in Italy today.   La Ratta said 15,000 to 20,000 Italian women visit hisassociation's clinics each year with sterility problems.   ``We have gone from sperm banks, which by now no one even blinksan eye at, to egg transplants, to test-tube babies and now to thesurrogate mother-sister,'' La Ratta said.   Health Minister Carlo Donat-Cattin said he has asked theministry's bioethics commission to devise recommendations forregulating artificial procreation.</TEXT></DOC>
