Prospect, a publicly traded, leveraged buy-out pool that already holds a 7.6% stake in Facet, boosted its tender offer last Thursday from $26 a share. Facet rejected the higher bid Friday, vowing to keep its anti-takeover-rights plan in place and to keep fighting the bid in court. Facet is a Tulsa, Okla.-based maker of auto parts and filters.    Meanwhile, Chemical Bank has agreed to provide $115 million in interim financing and $140 million in secured permanent financing once the Facet acquisition is completed, Prospect said. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. agreed to purchase as much as $90 million of preferred stock to be issued by Prospect's subsidiary, PRS Acquisition Inc. The LBO pool will be adding $35 million of its funds to complete the purchase.    Facet continued to trade above the offer price yesterday as investors speculated that a still-higher bid will be made. The shares gained 62.5 cents to $28.25 on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape. In national over-the-counter trading, Prospect closed at $7, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
