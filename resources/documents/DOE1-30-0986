In this electric-vehicle battery program, controlled laboratorytests were conducted to evaluate the effects of selected factors on theperformance and life of the EV-2300 lead-acid battery manufactured byJohnson Controls, Inc. These factors included simulated driving profileswith different levels of peak power demands for vehicle acceleration,long rest times after charge or discharge, and different methods of recharging.The performance and cycle life of a 12-module full-scale battery packand its support system were also evaluated. This report summarizes thework carried out on this program from January 1985 through April 1986.This work involved tests of the battery pack and support system, statisticalanalysis of capacity and power data from earlier tests of six-cell modules,and post-test analysis of selected modules and cells. 5 refs., 19 figs.,14 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
