But in this remote hamlet, home to one of the world's biggest asbestos mines, people aren't afraid to wallow in it.    In their homes, many local residents proudly display the lumpy green mineral on their mantels. Asbestriens urge visitors to tour a local asbestos museum, where guides describe the mineral as &quot;cute.&quot; And they breathe air that has as much as 50 times more asbestos than in most major cities. &quot;I bet you Yankees think we're weird,&quot; says a smiling Andre Bachand, the town's mayor.    Weird as it may seem, this benign view toward asbestos is precisely the attitude the Canadian government promotes. While many industrialized nations are phasing out asbestos, a fireproof mineral once widely used in building materials, Canada still produces more of it than any other country except the Soviet Union. Now, Canada is stepping up its efforts to revive a product that in the U.S. alone is estimated to have killed 100,000 people.    Canada is spending heavily to prop up sagging asbestos companies. It is threatening to sue the U.S. for recently ordering a ban on most asbestos. And most controversial of all, Canada is exporting close to half its asbestos to the Third World, where many workers are still oblivious to its dangers.    Already, the effort is causing an asbestos renaissance in Canada. Last year, the country's asbestos production -- in decline all decade and seemingly bound for extinction -- jumped 7%.    &quot;It's a bloody disgrace,&quot; says Ray Sentes, a political science professor at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan, who has studied Canada's asbestos industry for 10 years. &quot;If this continues, the end result will surely be disease and death for thousands upon thousands of workers&quot; who could develop cancer and other lung diseases after exposure to asbestos fibers and dust.    Canada argues that asbestos, which is less expensive than many substitute materials, is helping provide undeveloped countries with affordable shelter. And it says the kind it produces -- white asbestos -- is less harmful than other forms. A recent symposium conducted by Harvard University agreed that other types of asbestos &quot;pose a much greater risk&quot; than the white variety. &quot;We know it can be dangerous,&quot; says Wanda Hoskin, coordinator of asbestos issues for the Canadian government. &quot;We're just saying it can be used safely.&quot;    And it can be. But it takes such costly and elaborate precautions to use asbestos safely that most experts believe the risks are too great. Even Canada says it doesn't know just what the lethal level of asbestos exposure is: Some people have died from asbestos diseases without ever having recalled coming in contact with the subtance. &quot;There is no safe level of asbestos exposure,&quot; asserts Devra Davis, an occupational-health expert at the National Academy of Sciences. &quot;That's what makes it so deadly.&quot;    The industry Canada is trying to protect is actually a tiny one, with only 2,600 jobs and $300 million in annual revenues. But it is still important in the politically powerful province of Quebec. About 80% of Canada's asbestos is mined in the province and the industry accounts for one in every 10 mining jobs there. For many Quebec residents, asbestos inspires all the pride of oil in Texas and diamonds in South Africa.    And no place is prouder than Asbestos, where folks are willing to endure plenty to keep this industry going. The substance is mined from a mile-deep pit that looks like a decaying coliseum. Over the years, hundreds of Asbestriens have been forced to abandon their homes as the pit has expanded. And each day at 3:45 p.m. sharp comes a dynamite blast at the mine that rattles glass in nearby homes.    The risks of asbestos don't get much attention here. Hundreds of Canadians come to the town each year -- for vacation. A film at the asbestos and mineral museum touts the &quot;miracles&quot; of asbestos. Town officials pass out pamphlets -- partly paid for by the federal government -- with perky cartoon characters dismissing the risks of asbestos. And nobody seems concerned about the two-hundred foot piles of asbestos-laced waste that surround the town like a medieval forest.    &quot;Everything has its hazards. Electricity is dangerous, but you don't ban it,&quot; says Helen Gallup, cradling her 18-month-old grandson at the foot of her farm off Canadian Road. A hundred yards away, a gray cloud of asbestos-laced dust, stirred by the wind, rises from one of the piles. No government agency is monitoring the cancer rate here, despite evidence suggesting that even many residents who didn't work in the mine got cancer. One U.S. researcher, interpreting data from 1966 to 1977, found the fatal lung-cancer rate for women was 70% higher in Asbestos and a nearby mining town than normally would be expected in a rural Quebec community. &quot;The death rate could still be terrible, but nobody's checking,&quot; says Daniel Green, president of SVP, an environmental group in Montreal.    The reason? &quot;There just hasn't been a lot of money for asbestos health issues,&quot; says Don Wigle, an epidemiologist at Canada's Department of Health and Welfare.    But Canada hasn't been stingy with aid to the asbestos industry. In recent years, its federal and provincial governments have lent or given more than $40 million to asbestos companies. Last year, a $5 million grant was awarded to help one company build a new asbestos processor in Newfoundland -- even though the company had defaulted on a $16 million federal loan in 1987. And that is peanuts compared with Quebec's $500 million bailout of the industry 10 years ago -- when the province bought and began running two asbestos mines.    Such largess is only part of Canada's asbestos crusade. Government and industry officials are considering suing or taking some other action against the U.S. for planning to ban most asbestos imports by 1997, says Raymond Savoie, Quebec's minister of mines.    The U.S. still imports 11% of Canada's asbestos, and other countries &quot;may think they have to follow,&quot; says Mr. Savoie. In 1986, Canada used diplomatic channels to persuade Reagan administration officials to stall adoption of the ban, the terms of which were finally set in July.    Canada is even more aggressive about promoting asbestos to the Third World. Demand for the mineral has fallen 58% in Western Europe since 1980. But the need for low-cost building materials overrides most health concerns in many developing nations.&quot;You're talking about giving shelter to the poor,&quot; says George McCammon, acting president of the Asbestos Institute, based in Montreal. &quot;It would be immoral to deny it to them.&quot;    To tap into this market, Canada's government has gone so far as to ship free asbestos samples to Third-World countries. (Bangladesh got 790 metric tons, worth $600,000 in 1984 to 1985.) The government promotes asbestos to less-developed countries through the Asbestos Institute, which gets an average of $3 million a year in federal and provincial funding. Each year, the institute sends representatives to the Third World and issues reams of materials on its product; one promotional video beams that Canada's asbestos &quot;serves the world safely because Canada cares.&quot;    The efforts seem to be a success. Canadian exports of asbestos to South Korea, for example, increased to 44,000 tons last year from 5,000 tons in 1980; exports to Pakistan climbed to 6,000 tons from 300 tons in the same period.    Canada says it doesn't merely sell asbestos but also conducts seminars in Third World countries on using it safely. But Ottawa steps in when countries consider steps it believes are too vigilant.    When Thailand wanted to label imported asbestos bags with a skull-and-crossbones in 1984, Canada quickly persuaded the Thais to drop the idea. &quot;We thought the warning was excessive,&quot; says a spokesman for Candada's External Affairs Department. &quot;It was putting asbestos in the category of a toxic poison.&quot;    And most Third-World countries don't have the money, the inclination or the expertise to police asbestos use strenuously. Special ventilation systems are needed in asbestos factories. The air must be constantly monitored. Spacesuit-type garb is needed in asbestos removal work.&quot;Some of these countries use child labor. Do you think they're going to start to worry about dust in the workplace?&quot; asks Marcello Malentacchi, general secretary of the International Metal Workers Federation in Geneva. He says he repeatedly get reports of asbestos abuses in Brazil, Thailand and Malaysia, to name a few.    In one South Korean village, researchers found asbestos dust from a textile factory coating the walls of nearby homes. The plant's 300 workers, unaware of the risks, all had asbestos fibers in their phlegm. When the town complained, the factory's operator erected a higher wall -- a futile barrier against clouds of dust. It also dismissed reports of asbestos hazards as &quot;merely commercial propaganda.&quot;    &quot;This is an inhumane business,&quot; charges Jong Wha Park, director of the Christian Institute for Studies of Justice and Development, a public-interest group that sent the researchers last year. &quot;Why would Canada want to export something that kills people?&quot;    Canada's claim that its asbestos isn't as dangerous as other forms ignores the main reason the U.S., Denmark, Sweden and other countries are banning or restricting asbestos use. White asbestos &quot;may be less potent, but there's no evidence it's safe,&quot; says Charles Elkins, an official for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. One major study of 17,800 asbestos workers found 40% of the group's deaths were from asbestos exposure. Most victims mainly handled white asbestos, says a co-author of the study, Irving Selikoff of New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Even if a safe exposure level were known, most experts say it would be impossible to prevent construction and other workers from breathing higher doses.    To build its case, Canada often cites a litany of studies, without mentioning that most are industry-funded. Critics also say Canadian officials misinterpret or outright distort scientific data. One glossy brochure by the Canadian government proclaims that &quot;systematic controlled use of asbestos is favored and has been endorsed by many international agencies, such as the World Health Organization.&quot;    &quot;That's misleading to say that,&quot; says Thomas Ng, acting chief of the organization's worker health program. WHO has only set guidelines for workers who must handle asbestos, he says. &quot;We don't encourage or endorse.&quot; A Canadian government spokeswoman says that's nitpicking over &quot;semantics.&quot; But even Claude Messier, president of the miners union in Asbestos, concedes he isn't 100% certain that his industry is doing the right thing in promoting asbestos abroad. &quot;Maybe we're not right,&quot; he says.    But then his face brightens when he considers the mineral's fireproofing virtues: &quot;If we die and are sent to hell, at least we won't burn.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
