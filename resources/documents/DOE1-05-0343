Methods to compare the data generated andshown in the different images would be very useful. At Argonne an inexpensive,high resolution system has been developed to provide a means of correlatinginformation in the images generated by the different NDE methods. Thispaper describes the imaging system developed at Argonne and some of thetechniques used to aid in correlating features in the images generatedby the NDE methods. 4 refs., 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
