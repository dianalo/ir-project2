In Washington, however, State Department spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler said the Thai government confirmed to U.S. officials thatthe refugees will be allowed to remain in non-communist resistancecamps.   She said the action followed strong appeals from U.S. officialsto the Thai government that the refugees not be placed back underKhmer Rouge control because their safety could not be assured.   ``The United States goverment continues to be strongly opposed tothe return of these Cambodians to Khmer Rouge control,'' she said.   The estimated 600 refugees now are in a camp run by thenon-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front.   The Khmer Rouge, widely accused of human rights violations inareas under their control, have asked that the refugees be returned.But the U.N. Border Relief Operation has insisted the Cambodians beallowed to decide where they want to live.   The refugees had fled the Khmer Rouge camp of Kaiche after it wasattacked in mid-April.   It was unclear why there were conflicting accounts about the fateof the refugees.   The Thai official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thatas a ``compromise,'' the military decided the refugees should bemoved to Site 8, the only Khmer Rouge camp where the guerrillas haveallowed aid officials to give refugees full medical and otherservices.   Site 8 is north of Kaiche, which is along the Cambodian borderand in Thailand's eastern Trat province.   The Thai official did not say when the transfer would take place.   A Western relief official, also speaking on condition ofanonymity, called it a ``face-saving'' decision in which themilitary would avoid criticism for returning the refugees to Kaicheyet still support the Khmer Rouge, the largest of three guerrillagroups fighting Cambodia's Vietnam-backed government.   The official said some refugees ``have reasons to flee KhmerRouge control.''   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people when itruled Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnamese forces invaded and oustedit from power in late 1978.   The group fled to the border, established camps just insideThailand and allied itself with guerrillas of the People's NationalLiberation Front and of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.   Violations reported in Khmer Rouge refugee camps have includedforcing children to porter arms through mine fields and denyingpeople emergency medical treatment.   The relief official called the flight of the refugees to Sok Sannone of the largest escapes from a Khmer Rouge camp in recent years.   The refugees fled after gunners inside Cambodia shelled Kaicheand the nearby Ta Luan camp in April. Relief officials believehundreds of people were hurt, but the Khmer Rouge refused to allowany to be evacuated to outside hospitals.   In early May, the guerrillas moved several thousand refugees fromTa Luan closer to the border, evidently to prevent the UnitedNations from carrying out a plan to move them to a new, safer site.</TEXT></DOC>
