A report of the six oil ministers who constitute OPEC's market monitoring committee, to be presented to a ministerial conference opening today, is expected to endorse maintaining the year-old benchmark price despite increasingly negative market conditions. But the committee report will also acknowledge that the cartel is beleaguered with price discounting and overproduction by several members -- problems that other committees of leading oil ministers began discussing yesterday.    Significantly, the market committee's endorsement of maintaining the base price drew silence from war-ravaged Iran, a member of the committee, even though it has lately been calling the loudest for a price increase. Even during yesterday's committee meeting, the Iranian minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, clearly stated that a price increase of more than $2 a barrel was needed to offset inflation and the declining value of the dollar, in which OPEC oil is priced, according to Fernando Santos-Alvite of Ecuador, a member of the committee.    But when the price discussion was being concluded by Mana Saeed Otaiba, the minister from the United Arab Emirates, &quot;He recommended $18 -- and nobody objected,&quot; Mr. Santos-Alvite recalled in an interview. Ministers from Algeria and Libya, which previously had supported Iran's quest for a price increase, also raised no objection, he added. Iraq, which is at war with Iran, is the sixth member of the committee.    But negotiating positions hardened over another controversial issue as delegates arrived from the warring nations -- Iraq's at the Vienna Hilton and Iran's at the Intercontinental Hotel, on the opposite end of Stadtpark here. Iran's Mr. Aghazadeh declared that &quot;under no circumstances&quot; would Iran support a compromise being discussed here that would curb runaway overproduction by Iraq, which also needs funds to finance the war.    As previously reported, several ministers envisioned this compromise as the centerpiece of a plan to defend the current benchmark price in the face of huge inventories and a possible economic downturn following the world-wide stock market crash. Iraq has renounced its OPEC production quota because the figure is much smaller than Iran's -- and in the process has been flooding the market with oil. By increasing Iraq's quota to the same level as Iran's, many ministers believe, Iraq would actually cut its current production of 2.7 million barrels a day, bringing down total OPEC output.    Yesterday, Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister, affirmed that his country would honor a production ceiling equal to Iran's -- &quot;provided everyone else will adhere,&quot; he added.    The job of managing the Iraqi-Iranian dispute here -- and of preventing OPEC's price from collapsing -- falls mainly on Alhaji Rilwanu Lukman, the 49-year-old Nigerian engineer who is that country's oil minister and OPEC's president. &quot;We have a problem,&quot; Mr. Lukman told reporters. &quot;We have to see how best we can solve it.&quot;    The oil ministers face several choices, none easy. They could allow production to remain at its excessive level, totaling nearly two million barrels a day beyond the current ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day, and cut the benchmark price a dollar or two to maintain their market share. They could simply jawbone their offending colleagues to comply with quotas, adjourn the meeting and reconvene it early next year after observing how the glutted world oil market reacts.    The solution that remained in greatest favor yesterday -- accommodating Iraq's demand for a higher production quota and thereby bringing overall production under control -- could draw opposition from countries other than Iran. &quot;There is considerable resentment if any country is favored,&quot; said Bahman Karbassioun, a Geneva consultant and former OPEC staffer. Members outside the Persian Gulf region, such as Venezuela, &quot;would view it as yet another political compromise that would force them to forgo much needed oil revenue,&quot; he added.    But world oil market weakness may provide members with their best incentive to lay aside, at least for now, the every-man-for-himself policies complicating the meeting. &quot;They're going to have to break the perception they're not in control,&quot; said Jack W. Wilkinson, chief economist at Sun Co., one of the scores of economists, analysts, journalists, oil men and others drawn to Vienna to await the outcome of this meeting.    ---   Political Problems Noted   HOUSTON -- OPEC's members will base their discussions more on political problems than on supply and demand questions, according to participants at an Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. oil symposium here yesterday.    Joseph Stanislaw of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a research firm, said &quot;it will be a more politicized meeting than ever.&quot;    &quot;Nothing has changed fundamentally in supply and demand,&quot; said Edward Wahtera, an Arthur Andersen partner.    Mr. Stanislaw predicted that OPEC will agree to hold the price of oil at $18 a barrel, but he said there's better than a 50-50 chance the cartel will raise its production quota. And in an effort to calm jittery financial markets and oil-company planners, OPEC may agree to language saying the group could raise the oil price to $20 a barrel later next year, he said.    Nonetheless, Mr. Stanislaw said oil prices could fall $2 to $3 a barrel in January, after companies have completed their winter stockpilings. </TEXT></DOC>
