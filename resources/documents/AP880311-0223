WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Republican Bob Dole tried to rescue a presidential candidacythat was ``hanging by our fingernails'' on Friday and theDemocratic presidential race left behind Gary Hart, whoacknowledged ``the people have decided'' against him.   Democrat Jesse Jackson continued to roll with a narrow victoryover Michael Dukakis in Alaska's precinct caucuses. He looked forfurther encouragement in Saturday's caucuses in South Carolina, hisnative state, and in Tuesday's primary in Illinois, his adoptedstate.   The Democratic sideshow in South Carolina aside, thepresidential campaign in both parties focused on Illinois. Itsprimary posed an opportunity for George Bush to slam the door onDole's presidential hopes, and could present the Democrats with aclearer race _ or a more muddled one.   Trailing Bush badly in delegates and in polls in that state,Dole pulled more than $200,000 in television ads off the air anddismissed more than half his campaign staff.   ``We're hanging by our fingernails,'' he said in Moline. ``Weneed to somehow capture the attention of the Illinois voters.''   Dole bought a half hour of live television time on a Chicagostation for Saturday night and said, ``I dare George Bush to have adebate.''   He pointed to the plea to Iran-Contra charges Friday by formerWhite House aide Robert C. McFarlane and said the Iran-Contra issuewon't go away for Bush.   Dole said his campaign had between $1 million and $2 million onhand. But he was reeling from his 17-state collapse on SuperTuesday, when Bush won 16 of those states and took a giant steptoward the nomination.   ``What we need is to slow down this Super Tuesday momentum,''Dole said.   ``We will reassess after Illinois,'' he added. ``I am going tobe very realistic about this.''   The only other Republican left in the race, following JackKemp's withdrawal a day earlier, was Pat Robertson. He campaignedin Peoria, Ill., and vowed, ``I'm in it until New Orleans,'' wherethe Republicans hold their convention.   Bush campaigned with Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson at hisside, telling farm leaders he hoped to ``win as big in the land ofLincoln as I did in the land of cotton.''   He said he would decline a one-on-one confrontation with Dole,recalling he tried that with Ronald Reagan in 1980 _ a meeting thatprobably cost Bush the nomination.   ``I may be older, but I'm a lot smarter now, too,'' he said.   Hart ended his Democratic campaign for a second time, flanked byfamily members at a Denver announcement.   ``I got a fair hearing and the people have decided and now Ishould not go forward,'' he declared.   Hart's exit contained only a trace of the defiance that markedhis initial departure last May.   Once the prohibitive front-runner for his party's nomination,Hart dropped out the first time amid disclosures of hisrelationship with Miami model Donna Rice. He returned to the racein December, but he failed to win a single delegate and neverreached double-digit percentages in the primaries.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. continued his attacks on Dukakis, sayingthe Massachusetts governor's lack of experience in foreign policymeans he'd be ``a president who needs on-the-job training.''   ``His complete lack of experience in foreign policy is, I think,a major issue at a time when the next president must be prepared toseize the opportunities for a new relationship with the Soviets,''Gore said.   Dukakis said he hopes to get a share of Illinois' delegates anddemonstrate ``I can appeal to people all over the country.''   Dukakis began airing a new commercial that spoke to thepossibility of a brokered convention being talked up by PaulSimon's campaign. ``Some people would like to turn back the clock,to go back to the days when the voters didn't really pick theirpresidential nominee. They say you must turn over that power tothem, to use at a brokered convention,'' the narrator intones.   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo also chimed in, saying Democratsshould get behind the candidate with the most delegates at the endof the primaries, even if he doesn't have a majority.   ``If Mike Dukakis has 41 percent, get everybody together in aroom and say, `Jesse, Gore, Gephardt, you came close, but Mike'sthe candidate,''' Cuomo said. ``Let's pick the guy who's aheadafter California.''   Democrat Richard Gephardt campaigned in Chicago and complainedabout two rivals who hit him with a barrage of negative televisionads in the South.   ``I feel like Dukakis and Gore have mugged me in an alley,'' hesaid. ``They are borrowing my rhetoric, but they don't have anysubstance behind it.''   Jackson claimed 35 percent of the vote in a nonbindingpreference poll at Thursday night's Alaska caucuses. Dukakis wasnext with 31 percent.   Campaigning in South Carolina, Jackson urged blacks and whitesto unite around him.   ``It's not so much black versus white as it is barracudas eatingus small fish,'' Jackson said. ``They don't eat fish by color. Theyeat fish by size.''</TEXT></DOC>
