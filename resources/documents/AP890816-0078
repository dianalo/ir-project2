The call came one day after leaflets distributed by activists inthe occupied West Bank also told day laborers there to strike for aweek to protest the measure imposed on the Gazans.   Palestinians in the occupied territories were already in thesecond day of a separate general strike today. Shops, offices andmany schools remained closed for the strike, which was called tomark a prison riot last year that left two Palestinians dead.   The new strikes are to start Friday, when Israel has said it willstart enforcing the new identity card system. An estimated 50,000Gazans and 60,000 West Bank Arabs work in Israel and play animportant role in its economy.   On Tuesday, an Israeli truck driver was charged with manslaughterand reckless driving in the deaths of four Gaza Arabs on Dec. 8,1987. Riots touched off by the traffic deaths are viewed as thebeginning of the uprising.   In renewed violence today, five Palestinians were shot andwounded in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops, Arab reportssaid.   Slogans spray-painted on walls in the coastal Gaza Strip, signedby leaders of the 20-month-old uprising, urged the day laborers tostay away from their jobs in Israel to defy its efforts to controlthem by requiring the cards.   The government began to issue the computerized identity cards twomonths ago to try to control the movement of Gaza day laborers. Themove came after the kidnapping and killing of an Israeli soldier inthe Gaza Strip and other attacks by Gazans on Jews inside Israel.   Cards are denied to anyone with a criminal record or who isconsidered a security risk.   The work boycott could result in a permanent loss of jobs formany of the Palestinians. Israeli employers have been under growingpressure to replace Palestinian workers with Israelis, both forsecurity reasons and to reduce domestic unemployment.   Earlier, Palestinian activists launched a campaign to sabotagethe identity card operation, urging Palestinians to reject the cards.   The charges against the 29-year-old Israeli truck driver, HerzlBokovza, were delayed for 20 months because of police investigationsand a backlog in the courts, Justice Ministry spokeswoman Etty Eshedsaid.   According to witnesses, Bokovza's truck collided with a carcarrying Gaza laborers from the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing allfour Arabs in the car.   Rumors spread through the Gaza Strip that the truck hadintentionally run over the workers, and rioting broke out.</TEXT></DOC>
