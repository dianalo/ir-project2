The algorithm is on theaverage faster by a factor of 8 than similar codes developed for superconductingcyclotrons. Comparison with experimental results shows that the averagemagnetic field and the field flutter are predicted with a precision betterthan 5% for field levels above 1.7 T. It has proven to be a valuabletool in the design of room-temperature cyclotrons operating in the saturationlimit.</TEXT></DOC>
