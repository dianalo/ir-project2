The course, which would include refresher training in fundamental air-traffic control procedures, would be required for all controllers who work at O'Hare's Terminal Radar Approach Control facility, which handles traffic not only at O'Hare but also at several satellite airports.    The safety board recommendation was part of an intensive investigation prompted by an unusually high number of errors at O'Hare, which is the nation's busiest airport. Last year, it handled more than 56 million passengers.    The FAA didn't react specifically to the safety-board report, but did announce yesterday that it has begun a safety and efficiency review of the airport that is to be completed in late September. An FAA official said the issues raised in the safety-board report would be part of a broad agency examination of air-traffic control; airport operations; navigation and landing aids; and airport equipment.    According to a report released yesterday by the NTSB, O'Hare controllers committed 19 errors between Jan. 1 and June 7 of this year, some of which nearly caused midair collisions. For all of 1987, O'Hare controllers made 12 errors.    O'Hare's record is much worse than that of other air-traffic control facilities with similar traffic loads, the safety board said. In the first five months of this year, the number of controller errors at O'Hare was four times the number at Atlanta, five times that at Los Angeles and three times that at Dallas-Fort Worth.    One incident occurred June 6, when an O'Hare controller allowed a Learjet to get within 200 feet of a United Airlines Boeing 727, forcing the Learjet to bank sharply to avoid hitting the jetliner. &quot;We just about ran smack over a 727 here,&quot; the pilot told the controller.    The safety board, which investigated controller errors at O'Hare in 1986 and 1987, mounted a more intensive investigation this summer, focusing on the Terminal Radar Approach Control facility. Of the 19 controller errors committed through early June at O'Hare, 14 were made by Tracon controllers and five by tower controllers.    The Tracon controllers generally thought the level of safety at O'Hare was &quot;good,&quot; but complained that overtime requirements were onerous and that the facility was understaffed. To ease these problems, the safety board urged the FAA to offer higher pay to controllers who agree to be transferred to O'Hare and other facilities in high-cost areas.    The safety board also urged the FAA to quickly install equipment called the Aircraft Situation Display, which can predict when a specific chunk of airspace will become saturated. </TEXT></DOC>
