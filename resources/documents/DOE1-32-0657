The data on solar flux, powergeneration, load consumption energy, and productivity of drinking waterwere arranged and examined. The imperfect utilization of the solar fluxindicates the necessity for selecting the optimum conditions for thesystem. The efficiencies of the apparatus, i.e., the solar cells, theelectric batteries, and the electro dialytical equipment were higherthan the set values, respectively. An additive 10 m{sup 3} intermediate-concentrationwater tank was installed, and the salt concentration set value was changedfor enhancement of the utilization efficiency of the solar cell output,and also increase in the drinking water productivity. For the demonstrationplant, the productivity in FY 1986 was 3.4 m{sup 3}/day, satisfying theset value of 3.2 m{sup 3}/day. A questionnaire was sent out to 670 districtsin the remote island and peninsula areas which are under examinationfor applying the developed combined system. The result has revealed that100 districts have experienced shortage of water, and 100 districts haveproblems on water quality. (3 figs, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
