ShererandM;The Object Management Group Inc. (OMG) recently scored two major points inits quest to create object-oriented software standards: It signed up one ofindustry's heavyweights and released a document that provides a framework forthe standards.andM;Last month, the OMG recruited Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) as its newestmember.andP;  The systems giant, based in Maynard, Mass., now resides on the OMG'sboard of directors and is expected to contribute its own object-orientedtechnology for possible inclusion in the proposed standard.andM;&quot;There's a lot of work going on at Digital to solve problems in distributedobject management, and it's important that [DEC's] work be represented in theOMG's standards,&quot; said John Rymer, a senior editor at Seybold's OfficeComputing Report, published in Boston.andM;Still holding back from membership in the OMG are IBM and Microsoft Corp.,andO;both of which have sent representatives to OMG meetings, but have still notjoined the group.andM;The OMG comprises more than 70 software vendors and large corporations,including ATandamp;T, Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) and Data General Corp.andP;  Softwarethat adheres to the OMG standards will let data, documents and applicationsmodules be shared across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms.andM;&quot;Their work is already having some impact,&quot; said Ann Palermo, director ofoffice systems research at International Data Corp., a market-researchcompany in Framingham, Mass.andM;In the past year, several major vendors have adopted parts of the proposedOMG standard for their office systems -- for example, ATandamp;T has slated HP'sNewWave environment for some of its offerings, Palermo said.andM;In addition to attracting new members, the OMG last month released itsStandards Manual, a proposal that outlines the technical areas to bestandardized.andP;  Those areas include application programming interfaces (APIs)for defining and manipulating objects, APIs for distributing objects acrossheterogeneous networks and a standard interface for object-orienteddatabases.andM;&quot;Now that this foundation is in place, we can move into actually adaptingspecifications and technology,&quot; said Christopher Stone, president of the OMGin Framingham, Mass.andM;Stone expects the OMG to send out its first requests for proposals thissummer to canvass companies for technology that fits the Standards Manualguidelines.andP;  Rather than developing new technology, the OMG will only selectstandards from proven technology, Stone said.andM;&quot;Hopefully, we'll have a specification [for those areas] within eight to 10months,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
