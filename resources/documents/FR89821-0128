As in previous years,the Guideline sets forth ``Special Interest'' categories of Institute funding.Several proposed administrative changes are also summarized below. <ITAG tagnum="84">FY 1990 Funding Schedule</ITAG>The FY 1990 concept paper deadline is November 30, 1989. Papers must bepostmarked by that date. The Board of Directors will meet on March 9-11,1990 to invite formal applications based on the most promising conceptpapers. Applications will be due in mid-May, and awards approved by theBoard in mid-July.This will be the only round of funding in FY 1990. The FY 1991 fundingcycle is expected to begin with submission of concept papers in late November,1990 and to follow the same general schedule. However, the Institute willconsider proposals submitted after the established deadlines if the Boarddetermines that ``time factors or other critical considerations'' justifywaiving the deadlines or concept paper requirement. See section VI.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Interest Categories</ITAG>The Board proposes to reduce the 21 Special Interest categories in theFY 1989 Grant Guideline to 15. Three FY 1989 Special Interest categoriesare proposed for elimination: ``The Impact of User Fees on Court Revenuesand the Access to Justice''; ``The Implications of AIDS for the Courts'';and ``Courthouse Security and Operation.'' Several other FY 1989 Special Interest categories have been consolidatedinto new FY 1990 categories. The FY 1989 categories entitled ``Judicialand Court Personnel Career Enhancement'' and Careers in the Courts'' havebeen combined into a new category entitled ``Career Development in theCourts.'' See section II.B.2.a. The FY 1989 categories entitled ``Enforcementof Fines and Orders To Pay,'' ``Improved Enforcement and Management ofProbation,'' and ``Review and Enforcement of Continuing Court Orders''have been merged into a new category, ``Enforcement of Court Orders.''See section II.B.2.j.In addition, the FY 1989 Special Interest category on jury issues has beenrefocused on improving the use of juries. Many of the jury system managementissues included in last year's Guideline have been included in the SpecialInterest category on the ``Reduction of Litigation Expense and Delay.''See sections II.B.2. h. and i. The Special Interest category entitled ``SpecialNeeds of the Largest Urban Courts'' has been dropped from the list of SpecialInterest categories, but retained in the Guideline as a potential ``set-aside''category in the same manner as ``Single Jurisdiction'' projects. See sectionII.C.2. One new Special Interest category has been added: ``Improving Communicationand Coordination Between Courts.'' Section II.B.2.e.Two other Special Interest categories are also highlighted for comment.The ``Education and Training for Judges and Other Key Court Personnel''category (section II.B.2.b.) contains the funding allocations publishedfor public comment on May 12, 1989, as part of the Institute's JudicialEducation Support Strategy. 54 FR 20764. The allocations remain the sameas published, but the language has been revised to clarify that the allocationsare not ``target'' amounts but estimated allocations, depending on thevolume and quality of proposals submitted both in that Special Interestcategory and in other Guideline areas and categories. The Board also wishesto clarify that the allocations will be reconsidered in each year's Guidelineand adjusted annually, as appropriate, in light of the Institute's experienceand perceptions of the educational needs of judges and other court personnel.The Board specifically invites comment on the nature and scope of the sub-categories,as well as the amount of estimated funding to be allocated to each sub-category.The Board also invites comment on whether ``formula'' grants should beawarded to each State for the purpose of supporting the travel costs incurredby judges and other court personnel in attending in-State or out-of-Stateeducational sessions. The Board specifically solicits comment on the appropriatebasis for making such ``formula'' grants, e.g., State population, numberof judges, amount of State funding dedicated to training judges and othercourt personnel, as well as on the wisdom of the approach generally.The ``Alternative Dispute Resolution'' category (section II.B.2.c.) isalso highlighted for comment because of its inclusion of a major focuson the impact of private judging services on the State courts.Other Special Interest categories have also been revised to accord newemphasis to some topics, or to clarify their focus and intent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Changes</ITAG>Several minor administrative changes have been made in the proposed Guideline.Section VII (``Application Requirements for New Projects'') has been revisedto clarify what should be included in the description of a project's objectives;what evaluation approaches should be considered for various types of projects;and what information and explanations are needed to justify budget items.Section VII.D.12. now makes explicit the requirement that applicants describethe manner in which in-kind match contributions will be documented.Section IX (``Renewal Funding Procedures and Requirements'') has been revisedto clarify what information must be provided to the Institute in an applicationfor continuation or on-going support. Section X (``Compliance Requirements'')has been amended to clarify that when a cash match is offered, the Institutemay reduce the award amount if the full cash match is not contributed.See section X.B.; see also Section XI.D. Section XI (``Financial Requirements'')also has been amended to include expressly a longstanding Institute policyprohibiting the use of grant funds to support the travel costs of a memberof an organization to attend an annual or other standing meeting of theorganization; to clarify the audit reporting requirements; to describethe contents of Final Financial and Progress Reports; and to specify thatafter the end of the grant period, any unused grant funds must be remittedas soon as it is determined that they will not be required to meet outstandingobligations. Section XII has been revised to set forth the procedures fortransferring a grant from one organization to another.<ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendations to Grantwriters</ITAG>Over the past three years, Institute staff have reviewed approximately800 concept papers and 300 applications. On the basis of those reviews,inquiries from applicants, and the views of the Board, the Institute offersthe following recommendations to help potential applicants present workable,understandable proposals that can meet the funding criteria set forth inthis guideline. Suggestions regarding the preparation of application budgetshave been added to the recommendations for concept papers and applicationsmade in last year's Guideline.The Institute suggests that applicants make certain that they address thefollowing questions and issues when preparing a concept paper or application:1. <T3>What is the subject or problem you wish to address?</T3> Describe thesubject or problem and how it affects the courts and the public. Discusshow your approach will improve the situation or advance the state of theart or knowledge, and explain why it is the most appropriate approach totake. When statistics or research findings are cited to support a statementor position, the source of the citation should be referenced in a footnote.2. <T3>What do you want to do?</T3> Explain the goal(s) of the project insimple, straightforward terms. To the greatest extent possible, an applicantshould avoid a specialized vocabulary that is not readily understood bythe general public. Technical jargon does not enhance a paper.3. <T3>How will you do it?</T3> Describe the methodology carefully so thatwhat you propose to do and how you would do it is clear. All proposed tasksshould be set forth so that a reviewer can see a logical progression oftasks and relate those tasks directly to the accomplishment of the project'sgoal(s). When in doubt about whether to provide a more detailed explanationor to assume a particular level of knowledge or expertise on the part ofthe reviewers, err on the side of caution and provide the additional information.A description of project tasks will also help identify necessary budgetitems. All staff positions and project costs should relate directly tothe tasks described. The Institute encourages concept paper applicantsto attach letters of cooperation and support from the courts and relatedagencies that will be involved in or directly affected by the proposed.4. <T3>How will you know it works?</T3> Every project design must includean evaluation component to determine whether the proposed training, procedure,service, or technology accomplished the objectives it was designed to meet.Concept papers and applications should describe the criteria that willbe used to evaluate the project's effectiveness and identify program elementswhich will require further modification. The description in the applicationshould include how the evaluation will be conducted, when it will occurduring the project period, who will conduct it, and what specific measureswill be used. In most instances, the evaluation should be conducted bypersons not connected with the implementation of the procedure, training,service, or technique, or the administration of the project.5. <T3>How will others find out about it?</T3> Every project design must includea plan to disseminate the results of the training, research, or demonstrationbeyond the jurisdictions and individuals directly affected by the project.The plan should identify the specific methods which will be used to informthe field about the project, such as the publication of law review or journalarticles, presentations at appropriate conferences, or the distributionof key materials. A statement that a report or research findings ``willbe made available to'' the field is not sufficient. The specific meansof distribution or dissemination should be identified. Reproduction anddissemination costs are allowable budget items. 6. <T3>What are the specific costs involved?</T3> The budget in both conceptpapers and applications should be clearly presented. Major budget categoriessuch as personnel, benefits, travel, supplies, equipment, and indirectcosts should be clearly identified. 7. <T3>What, if any, match is being offered?</T3> Courts and other units ofState and local government (not including publicly supported institutionsof higher education) are required by the State Justice Institute Act, asamended, to contribute a match (cash, non-cash, or both) of not less than50 percent of the grant funds requested from the Institute. All other applicantsare also encouraged to provide a matching contribution to assist in meetingthe costs of a project. The match requirement works as follows: if thetotal cost of a project is anticipated to be $150,000, a State or localcourt or executive branch agency may request up to $100,000 from the Instituteto implement the project. The remaining $50,000 (50% of the $100,000 requestedfrom SJI) must be provided as match. Cash match includes funds directly contributed to the project by the applicant,or by other public or private sources. Non-cash match refers to in-kindcontributions by the applicant, or other public private sources. When matchis offered, the nature of the match (cash or in-kind) should be explainedand, at the application stage, the tasks and line items for which costswill be covered wholly or in part by match should be specified. 8. <T3>Which of the two budget forms should be used?</T3> Section VII.A.3.of the SJI Grant Guideline encourages use of the spreadsheet format ofForm C1 if the funding request exceeds $100,000. Form C1 also works wellfor projects with discrete tasks, no matter what the dollar value of theproject. Form C, the tabular format, may be preferred for projects lackinga number of discrete tasks, or for projects requiring less than $100,000of Institute funding. Generally, it is acceptable to use the form thatbest lends itself to representing most accurately the budget estimatesfor the project. 9. <T3>How much detail should be included in the budget narrative?</T3> Thebudget narrative of an application should provide the basis for computingall project-related costs, as indicated in section VII.D. of the SJI GrantGuideline. To avoid common shortcomings of application budget narratives,the following information should be included: andbullet; Personnel estimates that accurately provide the amount of timeto be spent by personnel involved with the project and the total associatedcosts, including current salaries for the designated personnel (e.g., ProjectDirector, 50% for one year, annual salary of $30,000 = $15,000). If salarycosts are computed using an hourly or daily rate, the annual salary andnumber of hours or days in a work-year should be shown.andbullet; Estimates for supplies and expenses supported by a complete descriptionof the supplies to be used, nature and extent of printing to be done, anticipatedtelephone charges, and other common expenditures, with the basis for computingthe estimates included (e.g., 100 reports andmultiply; 75 pages each andmultiply;.05/page = $375.00). Supply and expense estimates offered simply as ``basedon experience'' are not sufficient.In order to expedite Institute review of the budget, applicants shouldmake a final comparison of the amounts listed in the budget narrative withthose listed on the budget form. In the rush to complete all parts of theapplication on time, there may be many last-minute changes; unfortunately,when there are discrepancies between the budget narrative and the budgetform or the amount listed on the application cover sheet, it is not possiblefor the Institute to verify the amount of the request. A final check ofthe numbers on the form against those in the narrative will preclude suchconfusion. 10. <T3>What travel regulations apply to the budget estimates?</T3> Transportationcosts and per diem rates must comply with the policies of the applicantorganization, and a copy of the applicant's travel policy should be submittedas an appendix to the application. If the applicant does not have a travelpolicy established in writing, then travel rates must be consistent withthose established by the Institute or the Federal Government (a copy ofthe Institute's travel policy is available upon request). The budget narrativeshould state which regulations are in force for the project and shouldinclude the number of persons traveling, the number of trips to be taken,and the length of stay. The estimated costs of travel, lodging, and othersubsistence should be listed separately. When combined, the subtotals forthese categories should equal the estimate listed on the budget form. 11. <T3>May qrant funds be used to purchase equipment?</T3> Grant funds maybe used to purchase or lease only that equipment which is essential toaccomplishing the objectives of the project. The budget narrative mustlist such equipment and explain why the equipment is necessary. Writtenprior approval of the Institute is required when the amount of automaticdata processing equipment to be purchased or leased exceeds $10,000, orthe software to be purchased exceeds $3,000. 12. <T3>To what extent may indirect costs be included in the budget estimates?</T3>It is the policy of the Institute that all costs should be budgeted directly;however, if an applicant has an indirect cost rate that has been approvedby a Federal agency within the last two years, an indirect cost recoveryestimate may be included in the budget. A copy of the approved rate agreementshould be submitted as an appendix to the application. If an applicantdoes not have an approved rate agreement, an indirect cost rate proposalshould be prepared in accordance with Section XI.H.3 of the Grant Guideline,based on the applicant's audited financial statements for the prior fiscalyear (applicants lacking an audit must budget all project costs directly).If an indirect cost rate proposal is to be submitted, the budget shouldreflect estimates based on that proposal. Obviously, this requires thatthe proposal be completed for the applicant's use at the time of applicationso that the appropriate estimates may be included; however, grantees haveuntil three months after the project start date to submit the indirectcost proposal to the Institute for approval.13. <T3>Does the budget truly reflect all costs required to complete the project?</T3>After preparing the program narrative portion of the application, applicantsmay find it helpful to list all the major tasks or activities requiredby the proposed project, including the preparation of products, and notethe individual expenses, including personnel time, related to each. Thiswill help to ensure that, for all tasks described in the application (e.g.,development of a videotape, research site visits, distribution of a finalreport), the related costs appear in the budget and are explained correctlyin the budget narrative. <ITAG tagnum="84">Contact Persons for State Agencies Administering Institute Grantsto State and Local Courts </ITAG>The Institute would appreciate information regarding the name, title, addressand telephone number of the person designated by the State Supreme Courtto be responsible for overseeing the administration of Institute grantsawarded to the courts of the State.

The Institute, a private nonprofit corporationestablished by an Act of Congress, is authorized to award grants, cooperativeagreements and contracts to State and local courts and their agencies;national nonprofit organizations controlled by, operating in conjunctionwith, and serving the judicial branch of State governments; and nationalnonprofit organizations for the education and training of judges and supportpersonnel of the judicial branch of State governments. The Institute may also award funds to other nonprofit organizations withexpertise in judicial administration; institutions of higher education;individuals, partnerships, firms, or corporations; and private agencieswith expertise in judicial administration if the objectives of the fundedprogram can be better served by such an entity. Funds may also be awardedto Federal, State or local agencies and institutions other than courtsfor services that cannot be provided for adequately through nongovernmentalarrangements. Approximately $10 million is available for grants, contracts, and cooperativeagreements from FY 1990 appropriations. The Institute may also providefinancial assistance in the form of interagency agreements with other grantors.The Institute will consider applications for funding support that addressany of the areas specified in its enabling legislation; however, the Boardof Directors of the Institute has designated certain program categoriesas being of special interest. The Institute has established one round of competition for FY 1990 funds,with a concept paper submission deadline of November 30, 1989. This guidelineapplies to concept papers and formal applications submitted for FY 1990funding. The awards made by the State Justice Institute are governed by the requirementsof this guideline and the authority conferred by Pub. L. 98-620, TitleII, 42 U.S.C. 10701, <T3>et seq.</T3> as amended.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background </ITAG>The State Justice Institute (``Institute'') was established by Public Law98-620 to improve the administration of justice in the State courts inthe United States. Incorporated in the State of Virginia as a private,nonprofit corporation, the Institute is charged, by statute, with the responsibilityto: A. Direct a national program of financial assistance designed to assurethat each citizen of the United States is provided ready access to a fairand effective system of justice; B. Foster coordination and cooperation with the Federal judiciary; C. Promote recognition of the importance of the separation of powers doctrineto an independent judiciary; and D. Encourage education for judges and support personnel of State courtsystems through national and State organizations, including universities.To accomplish these broad objectives, the Institute is authorized to providefunds to State courts, national organizations which support and are supportedby State courts, national judicial education organizations, and other organizationsthat can assist in improving the quality of justice in the State courts.The Institute is supervised by an eleven-member Board of Directors appointedby the President, by and with the consent of the Senate. The Board is statutorilycomposed of six judges, a State court administrator and four members ofthe public, no more than two of whom can be of the same political party.The Institute's program budget for Fiscal Year 1990 is approximately $10million. Through the award of grants, contracts and cooperative agreements,the Institute is authorized to perform the following activities: 1. Support research, demonstrations, special projects, technical assistance,and training to improve the administration of justice in the State courts;2. Provide for the preparation, publication, and dissemination of informationregarding State judicial systems; 3. Participate in joint projects with Federal agencies and other privategrantors; 4. Evaluate or provide for the evaluation of programs and projects fundedby the Institute to determine their impact upon the quality of criminal,civil, and juvenile justice and the extent to which they have contributedto improving the quality of justice in the State courts; 5. Encourage and assist in furthering judicial education; 6. Encourage, assist, and serve in a consulting capacity to State and localjustice system agencies in the development, maintenance, and coordinationof criminal, civil, and juvenile justice programs and services; and 7. Be responsible for the certification of national programs that are intendedto aid and improve State judicial systems.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Scope of the Program </ITAG>During FY 1990, the Institute will consider applications for funding supportthat address any of the areas specified in its enabling legislation. TheBoard, however, has designated certain program categories as being of ``specialinterest.'' See section II.B. A. Authorized Program Areas The State Justice Institute Act authorizes the Institute to fund projectsaddressing one or more of the following program areas: 1. Assistance to State and local court systems in establishing appropriateprocedures for the selection and removal of judges and other court personneland in determining appropriate levels of compensation; 2. Education and training programs for judges and other court personnelfor the performance of their general duties and for specialized functions,and national and regional conferences and seminars for the disseminationof information on new developments and innovative techniques; 3. Research on alternative means for using judicial and nonjudicial personnelin court decisionmaking activities, implementation of demonstration programsto test such innovative approaches, and evaluations of their effectiveness;4. Studies of the appropriateness and efficacy of court organizations andfinancing structures in particular States, and support to States to implementplans for improved court organization and financing; 5. Support for State court planning and budgeting staffs and the provisionof technical assistance in resource allocation and service forecastingtechniques; 6. Studies of the adequacy of court management systems in State and localcourts, and implementation and evaluation of innovative responses to recordsmanagement, data processing, court personnel management, reporting andtranscription of court proceedings, and juror utilization and management;7. Collection and compilation of statistical data and other informationon the work of the courts and on the work of other agencies which relateto and affect the work of courts; 8. Studies of the causes of trial and appellate court delay in resolvingcases, and establishing and evaluating experimental programs for reducingcase processing time; 9. Development and testing of methods for measuring the performance ofjudges and courts and experiments in the use of such measures to improvethe functioning of judges and the courts; 10. Studies of court rules and procedures, discovery devices, and evidentiarystandards to identify problems with the operation of such rules, procedures,devices, and standards; and the development of alternative approaches tobetter reconcile the requirements of due process with the need for swiftand certain justice, and testing of the utility of those alternative approaches;11. Studies of the outcomes of cases in selected areas to identify instancesin which the substance of justice meted out by the courts diverges frompublic expectations of fairness, consistency, or equity; and the development,testing and evaluation of alternative approaches to resolving cases insuch problem areas;12. Support for programs to increase court responsiveness to the needsof citizens through citizen education, improvement of court treatment ofwitnesses, victims, and jurors, and development of procedures for obtainingand using measures of public satisfaction with court processes to improvecourt performance; 13. Testing and evaluating experimental approaches to provide increasedcitizen access to justice, including processes which reduce the cost oflitigating common grievances and alternative techniques and mechanismsfor resolving disputes between citizens; and 14. Other programs, consistent with the purposes of the Act, as may bedeemed appropriate by the Institute, including projects dealing with therelationship between Federal and State court systems in areas where thereis concurrent State-Federal jurisdiction and where Federal courts, directlyor indirectly, review State court proceedings. Funds will <T3>not </T3>be made available for the ordinary, routine operation of courtsystems in any of these areas. B. Special Interest Program Categories <ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Description. </ITAG>The Institute is interested in funding both innovative programs and programsof proven merit that can be replicated in other jurisdictions. Althoughapplications in any of the statutory program areas are eligible for fundingin FY 1990, the Institute is especially interested in funding those projectsthat: a. Formulate new procedures and techniques, or creatively enhance existingarrangements to improve the courts; b. Address aspects of the State judicial systems that are in special needof serious attention; c. Have national significance in terms of their impact or replicabilityin that they develop products, services and techniques that may be usedin other States; d. Create and disseminate products that effectively transfer the informationand ideas developed to relevant audiences in State and local judicial systemsor provide technical assistance to facilitate the adaptation of effectiveprograms and procedures in other State and local jurisdictions. A projectwill be identified as a ``Special Interest'' project if it meets the fourcriteria set forth above and (1) it falls within the scope of the ``specialinterest'' program areas designated below or (2) information coming tothe attention of the Institute from the State courts, their affiliatedorganizations, the research literature, or other sources demonstrates thatthe project responds to another special need or interest of the State courts.Concept papers and applications which address a ``Special Interest'' categorywill be accorded a preference in the rating process. (See the selectioncriteria listed in sections VI.B., ``Concept Paper Submission Requirementsfor New Projects,'' and VIII.B., ``Application Review Procedures.'') <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Specific Categories. </ITAG>The Board has designated the areas set forth below as ``Special Interest''program categories. The order of listing does not imply any ordering ofpriorities among the categories. a. <T3>Career Development in the Courts. </T3>This category includes the developmentand testing of innovative methods to enhance judicial and court personnelcareers, other than direct increases in salary,  and innovative methodsto attract and select persons in the judiciary and other court occupations.These methods could include approaches that emphasize the intrinsic rewardsof the profession, such as job enrichment and participative managementstrategies, judicial and nonjudicial personnel exchange programs, innovativeprograms or techniques for reducing judicial stress or ``burnout,'' sabbaticalprograms, or mentoring programs. This category also includes efforts toprepare lawyers for judicial careers, to encourage qualified persons toseek and accept positions as judges and court professionals, and to evaluatethe impact of equal employment opportunity policies on court personnel,administration and the public perception of the courts. In addition, the Board is interested in supporting projects to assess andenhance university-based programs preparing individuals for careers incourt management. Possible projects include an assessment of current curriculain terms of the emerging needs of the field; a study of ways to attractstudents to court management courses more effectively; and the developmentor enhancement of a specific university-based program. b. <T3>Education and Training for Judges and Other Key Court Personnel. </T3>TheBoard of Directors anticipates allocating approximately $3,350,000 forjudicial education projects in FY 1990. Of this amount, it is expectedthat up to $2,600,000 will provide support to projects which the Institutehas not funded previously, and up to $750,000 will provide renewal fundingfor judicial education programs of proven merit under Section IX of theGuideline. The exact amount to be awarded in each subcategory listed belowwill depend on the number and quality of the applications submitted inboth this Special Interest category and other areas of the Guideline. TheBoard anticipates allocating the $2,600,000 available for new awards inFiscal Year 1990 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">i.

Funding of these initiatives doesnot include support for training programs conducted by national providersof judicial education unless such a program is designed specifically fora particular State and has the express support of the State Chief Justice,State Court Administrator, or State Judicial Educator. The types of programsto be supported within this category should be defined by individual Stateneed but may include:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The development of State-determined standards for judicial education;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The preparation of State plans for judicial education, includingmodel plans for career-long education for the judiciary (e.g., new judgetraining and orientation followed by continuing education and career development);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Seed money for the creation of an ongoing State-based entity forplanning, developing and administering judicial education programs; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The development of a pre-bench orientation program and other trainingfor new judges; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The development of benchbooks and other educational materials; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Seed money for innovative continuing education and career developmentprograms, including training which brings teams of judges, court managersand other court personnel together to address topics of mutual interestand concern.</ITAG>ii. <T3>National and Regional Training Programs. </T3>This category includessupport for national or regional training programs developed by any provider,e.g., national organizations, State courts, universities, or public interestgroups. Within this category, priority will be given to training projectswhich address issues of major concern to the State judiciary and othercourt personnel. Programs to be supported may include:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Training programs or seminars on topics of interest and concern thattranscend State lines; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Multi-State or regional training programs sponsored by national organizations,State courts or universities; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Specialized training programs for State trial and appellate courtjudges, State and local court managers, or other court personnel.</ITAG>iii. <T3>Technical Assistance. </T3>Unlike the preceding categories which supportdirect training, ``Technical Assistance'' refers to services necessaryfor the development of effective educational projects for judges and othercourt personnel. Projects in this category should focus on the needs ofthe States, and applicants should demonstrate clearly their ability towork effectively with State judicial educators. Within this category, priority will be given to the support of projectsfocused on State-to-State, State-to-national, and national-to-State transferof ideas and information. Support and assistance to be provided by suchprojects may include:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Development of educational curricula and support materials; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Training faculty in adult education theory and practice; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Consultation on planning, developing and administering State judicialeducation programs;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Coordination and exchange of information among judicial educationproviders; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Collection and dissemination of information about exemplary adultand continuing judicial education programs; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Development of improved methods of evaluating court education programs;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_On-site assistance in any of the areas listed above.</ITAG>iv. <T3>Conferences.</T3> This category includes support for regional or nationalconferences on topics of major concern to the State judiciary and courtpersonnel. Court education programs should assure that faculty understand and applyadult education techniques and teaching methods; provide opportunitiesfor structured interaction among participants; develop tangible productsand materials for use by the faculty, participants and other judicial educators;employ a process for the recruitment of qualified and effective faculty;and develop sound methods for evaluating the impact of the training. c. <T3>Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).</T3> This category covers theevaluation of new and existing dispute resolution procedures and programsthat have a substantial likelihood of resolving complex civil litigation,and cases involving families and children (e.g., divorce, child support,visitation, and custody, juvenile delinquency, children in need of supervision,and child abuse and neglect) more fairly, more expeditiously and less expensivelythan the traditional court process, with particular emphasis on the impactof those procedures and programs on the quality of justice provided, litigantand court costs, court workload, and case processing. This category also includes evaluation of the impact of ``settlement weeks''in civil cases and the examination of the judicial role in settling cases,including the effectiveness of various settlement techniques that judgesmay use, the most appropriate point(s) in the litigation process to convenea settlement conference, and the ethical questions that may confront ajudge seeking to settle a case. The Board is especially interested in empirical research projects thatwould examine the impact of ``private judging services'' on the State courts,including studies of:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The volume and nature of cases, e.g., contract, tort, insurance,being adjudicated by private judging organizations; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The types of substantive legal issues, e.g., grounds for liability,that are being adjudicated, the types of procedures used to adjudicatecases and the frequency with which those procedures used; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The ``due process'' protections afforded by private judging organizations,including evidentiary rules; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The types of parties in such cases, including the demographic andeconomic characteristics of both plaintiffs and defendants; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The factors that motivate litigants to take their cases to privatejudges; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The disposition of the cases, including the speed of disposition,the satisfaction of the parties, and the frequency with which judgmentsare being brought to the State courts for enforcement or appeal; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The effect that private judging organizations have had on the caseloadof State courts in the immediate jurisdiction; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The numbers of judges retained by such organizations, their legalbackgrounds, their compensation, and the factors that motivated their decisionto seek and accept employment with such organizations.</ITAG>To help interested applicants secure the cooperation of the organizationsto be studied, the Institute plans to send letters expressing its interestin such research projects to leading private judging organizations in thenear future. The letters will solicit their cooperation and explain theconfidentiality and human subject protection provisions of the SJI Actand Grant Guideline. d.<T3> The Future and the Courts.</T3> This category includes research onthe changing demands and circumstances that will face the courts in the21st century, and the long-range planning and implementation of modificationsthat may be needed in court organization, financing, procedures, services,personnel, and facilities to respond to those demands and circumstances.A proposed project could focus on such issues as:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The possible changes in court structure, court administration, orlegal authority that might help the State courts more effectively administerjustice; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_How developments in biology, chemistry, disease and disease control,engineering, genetics, computer design and other sciences are likely toaffect the cases adjudicated by the State courts; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The impact that demographic changes in the American population overthe next generation will have on the State courts.</ITAG>e. <T3>Improving Communication and Coordination Among Courts. </T3>This categoryincludes the development, implementation and evaluation of innovative procedural,administrative, technological, and organizational methods to improve communicationand coordination among State courts and between State and Federal courtshearing related cases. Among the circumstances in which such improved communicationand coordination are particularly needed, are:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Instances in which multiple cases are pending involving members ofa single family (e.g., divorce, domestic violence, child support, and childcustody proceedings); </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Post conviction challenges in capital cases; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Mass tort litigation; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Instances in which a litigant in a State civil, criminal, or domesticrelations case is subject to a Federal bankruptcy proceeding.</ITAG>f. <T3>Application of Technology. </T3>This category includes the testingof innovative applications of technology to improve the operation of courtmanagement systems and judicial practices at both the trial and appellatecourt levels. The Board seeks to support local experiments with promising but untestedapplications of technology in the courts that include a structured evaluationof the impact of the technology in terms of costs, benefits, and staffworkload. In this context, untested refers to applications of technologythat are not used widely by the courts or that include a unique elementto enhance their usefulness to the courts. (See paragraph XI.H.2.b. regardingthe limits on the use of grant funds to purchase equipment and software.)In previous funding cycles, grants have been awarded to support developmentand evaluation of: an interactive computerized information system to assistpro se litigants; the effects, costs, and benefits of videotape as a techniquefor making the record of trial court proceedings; an automated microfilmsystem and an optical disk system for maintaining and retrieving probatecourt records; an electronic mail system and computer-based bulletin boardto facilitate information transfer among criminal justice agencies in adjoininglocal jurisdictions; an automated Statewide records management system;the effects of telephone conferencing in interstate child support cases;the integration of bar-coding technology with an existing automated casemanagement system; and the use of FAX technology by courts. Current grantsare also supporting the development of court automation performance standardsand the development of a court technology bulletin and court technologyassistance services. g. <T3>Improving the Decisionmaking Process in the Appellate Courts. </T3>TheBoard specifically invites proposals for establishing intermediate appellatecourt panels responsible for handling specific subject matter cases. TheBoard would like to support a carefully designed and evaluated ``subjectmatter panel'' experiment to test whether such panels result in more uniformityand stability in the law; preserve judicial authority and avoid undue delegationto non-judicial staff; and expedite the decisionmaking process. The Board contemplates that the subject matter panels would consist ofthree to five judges who are assigned specific types of cases, e.g., torts,family matters, property cases. Criminal cases could be assigned to onepanel or allocated among all of them. The panels need not be permanentbut could shift through gradual rotation. For a more thorough discussionof subject matter panels, see Meador, ``An Appellate Court Dilemma anda Solution Through Subject Matter Organization,'' 16 <T3>Journal of Law Reform</T3> 471 (1983). In addition, the Board is interested in supporting projects which examinethe usefulness of structural changes and procedures designed to expeditethe decisionmaking process in the appellate courts, including innovativeprocedures for the submission of cases through oral argument without traditionalbriefing, and the application of differential case management techniquesto the appellate process.h. <T3>Reduction of Litigation Expense and Delay. </T3>This category includesthe implementation and evaluation of innovative programs and proceduresdesigned to reduce substantially the expense and delay in civil, criminal,domestic relations, juvenile or other types of litigation at the trialor appellate level (or both); the examination of effective methods of limitingthe expense and delay arising from the use of discovery procedures; andthe development, implementation and evaluation of legal and administrativeprocedures to expedite the jury selection and empanelment process, reducethe expense of operating the jury system, and limit the cost and inconvenienceof jury service. i. <T3>The Use of Juries.</T3> This category includes the evaluation of legaland administrative procedures relating to jurors that are designed to enhancethe fairness and expeditiousness of the litigation process, such as improvedmethods for orienting and instructing jurors, the clarification of juryinstructions, permitting jurors to take notes or ask questions, the useof jury panels of different sizes, the acceptance of non-unanimous verdicts,the use of ``blue ribbon'' panels, or the elimination of juries in specifiedclasses of cases. j. <T3>Enforcement of Court Orders.</T3> This category includes the development,implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness and costs of innovativemethods of enforcing compliance with court orders. These methods may applyto orders issued in a range of cases, such as orders imposing fines, restitution,community service, or conditions of probation in a criminal or juveniledelinquency proceeding; orders requiring payment of child support or settingthe terms for visitation and custody in divorce and paternity cases; dispositionalorders in child abuse and neglect, civil commitment, guardianship, andinstitutional reform litigation; and protection orders in domestic violenceproceedings.k. <T3>Substance Abuse.</T3> This category includes the planning and presentationof conferences, seminars, or other forums for judges, probation officers,caseworkers and other court personnel to examine court-related issues concerningdrug and alcohol abuse, and to discuss the appropriate role of the courtsin addressing the problem of substance abuse; the development and testingof profiles, guides, risk assessment instruments and other tools to assistjudges in making release, dispositional and treatment decisions in casesinvolving substance-abusing persons; the development and evaluation ofinnovative case management techniques for handling the increasing volumeof substance abuse-related cases fairly and expeditiously; and the evaluationof the effectiveness of innovative drug and alcohol treatment programsthat are administered directly by the courts or through contracts negotiatedbetween the service providers and the courts. 1. <T3>Responding to the Court-Related Needs of Victims of Crime and Witnesses.</T3>This category includes the implementation and evaluation of innovativecourt-based programs and procedures for providing fair treatment to victimsof crime and witnesses. Court-based programs are those that are administereddirectly by the courts or through contracts negotiated between serviceproviders and the courts. Programs and services operating in prosecutors'offices are ordinarily not considered favorably for funding. Eligible projectsmay involve civil, criminal, domestic relations, and other types of cases,including but not limited to demonstrations and evaluations of programsand procedures to assure the fair, effective and efficient handling ofdomestic violence cases, such as: the appropriate use of court-ordereddomestic violence mediation programs; evaluations of innovative court-orderedtreatment programs for offenders and their families; and implementationand evaluation of innovative procedures governing the issuance and enforcementof protective orders. m. <T3>Responding to the Court-Related Needs of Elderly and Disabled Persons.</T3>This category includes research and demonstration projects on issues relatedto access to the courts by elderly persons and physically or mentally disabledpersons, and the fair and effective handling of cases affecting those persons.The issues that may be addressed include but are not limited to:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The fair and effective consideration of cases concerning the provisionof medical, mental health, social and support services to:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The fair and effective consideration of cases concerning the impositionof plenary or limited surrogate decisionmakers; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The improvement of access to courthouses and court proceedings forlitigants, jurors, witnesses, and victims of crime who have mobility orcommunication impairments.</ITAG>n. <T3>Public Education about the Courts. </T3>This category includes projectsdesigned to improve the public's understanding of the courts, such as thedevelopment of videotapes and other informational materials to be shownto citizens' groups or in schools; the development of survey instrumentsby which the courts could determine areas of public dissatisfaction ormisunderstanding; and other innovative approaches to enhancing the public'sunderstanding of the purpose of the courts, the operations of the judicialsystem, and the system's responsiveness to its citizens.o. <T3>The Relationship Between State and Federal Courts. </T3>This categoryincludes research to develop creative ideas and procedures that could improvethe administration of justice in the State courts and at the same timereduce the work burdens of the Federal courts. Such research projects mightaddress innovative State court procedures for:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Reducing the burdens attendant to Federal habeas corpus cases involvingState convictions;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Handling civil, criminal, domestic relations or other types of casesin which a party also is subject to a Federal bankruptcy proceeding;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Processing complex multistate litigation in the State courts;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Facilitating the adjudication of Federal law questions by State courtswith appropriate opportunities for review; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Otherwise allocating judicial burdens between and among Federal andState courts.</ITAG>Other possible areas of research include studies examining the impact ofthe enforcement of selected Federal statutes on the State courts, and thefactors that motivate litigants to select the Federal or State courts incases in which there is concurrent jurisdiction.C. Programs Addressing a Critical Need of a Single State or Local Jurisdiction1. The Board will consider supporting a limited number of projects submittedby State or local courts that address the needs of only the applicant Stateor local jurisdiction.Concept papers and applications requesting funds for projects under thissection must meet the requirements of sections VI (``Concept Paper SubmissionRequirements for New Projects'') and VII (``Application Requirements''),respectively, and must demonstrate that:a. The proposed project is essential to meeting a critical need of thejurisdiction; andb. The need cannot be met solely with State and local resources withinthe foreseeable future.2. The Board has established two categories of such projects:a. <T3>Critical Needs of the Largest Urban Courts. </T3>This category is limitedto projects submitted by State or local court systems regarding the implementationand evaluation of programs and procedures to address the critical needsof a trial court serving a city or county with a population of at least1,000,000 persons. Such projects might include but are not limited to thedevelopment and testing of improved methods to assist those courts in selecting,retaining and removing judges, or projects to relieve acute problems inthe court's ability to handle civil, criminal, domestic relations, juvenileand other types of cases in a fair and timely manner. The Board will considerawarding grants of up to $500,000 each to support projects in this category.The Board has set aside up to $1,000,000 of available grant funds to supportsuch projects.b. <T3>Projects Addressing the Critical Needs of Other State and Local Jurisdictions.</T3>This category includes projects addressing a critical need of a Stateor local jurisdiction that is not a major urban court, as defined in thepreceding paragraph. A project within this category may address any ofthe topics included in the Special Interest Categories or statutory ProgramAreas. The Board has set aside up to $500,000 of available grant fundsto support such projects.3. All awards under this category are subject to the matching requirementsset forth in section X.B.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.

Eligibility for Award</ITAG>In awarding funds to accomplish these objectives and purposes, the Institutehas been directed by Congress to give priority to State and local courtsand their agencies (42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1)(A)); national nonprofit organizationscontrolled by, operating in conjunction with, and serving the judicialbranches of State governments (42 U.S.C. 10705 (b)(1)(B)); and nationalnonprofit organizations for the education and training of judges and supportpersonnel of the judicial branch of State governments (42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1)(C)).An applicant will be considered a ``priority'' education and training applicantunder section 10705(b)(1)(C) if: (1) The principal purpose or activityof the applicant is to provide education and training to State and localjudges and court personnel; and (2) the applicant demonstrates a recordof substantial experience in the field of judicial education and training.The Institute also is authorized to make awards to other nonprofit organizationswith expertise in judicial administration, institutions of higher education,individuals, partnerships, firms, corporations, and private agencies withexpertise in judicial administration, provided that the objectives of therelevant program area(s) can be served better. In making this judgment,the Institute will consider the likely replicability of the projects' methodologyand results in other jurisdictions. For-profit organizations are also eligiblefor grants and cooperative agreements; however, they must waive their fees.Finally, the Institute is authorized to make awards to Federal, State orlocal agencies and institutions other than courts for services that cannotbe adequately provided through nongovernmental arrangements.Each application for funding from a State or local court must be approved,consistent with State law, by the State's Supreme Court or its designatedagency or council. The latter shall receive all Institute funds awardedto such courts and be responsible for assuring proper administration ofInstitute funds, in accordance with section XI.B.2 of this guideline. Alist of persons to contact in each State regarding approval of applicationsfrom State and local courts and administration of Institute grants to thosecourts is contained in the Appendix. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Types of Projects and Amounts of Awards</ITAG>A. Types of ProjectsExcept as expressly provided in section II.B.2.b. and II.C. above, theInstitute has placed no limitation on the overall number of awards or thenumber of awards in each special interest category. The general types ofprojects are:1. Education and training;2. Research and evaluation;3. Demonstration; and4. Technical assistance.B. Size of Awards1. Except as specified in paragraphs V.B.2. and 3., concept papers andapplications for new projects and applications for continuation grantsmay request funding in amounts up to $300,000, although awards in excessof $200,000 are likely to be rare and to be made, if at all, only for highlypromising proposals that will have a significant impact nationally.2. A project addressing the needs of the largest urban courts under SectionII.C.2.a. may receive support of up to $500,000.3. Applications for on-going support grants may request funding in amountsup to $600,000. At the discretion of the Board, the funds to support ongoingsupport grants may be awarded either entirely from the Institute's appropriationsfor the Fiscal Year of the award or from the Institute's appropriationsfor successive Fiscal Years beginning with the Fiscal Year of the award.When funds to support the full amount of an ongoing support grant are notawarded from the appropriations for the Fiscal Year of award, funds tosupport the second and any subsequent years of the grant will be made availableupon the satisfactory performance of the project as reflected in the quarterlyProgress Reports required to be filed and routine grant monitoring, andsubject to the availability of appropriations for that Fiscal Year.C. Length of Grant Periods1. Grant periods for all new and continuation projects ordinarily willnot exceed 24 months.2. Grant periods for on-going support grants ordinarily will not exceed36 months.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Concept Paper Submission Requirements for New Projects</ITAG>Concept papers are an extremely important part of the application processbecause they enable the Institute to learn the program areas of primaryinterest to the courts and to explore innovative ideas, without imposingheavy burdens on prospective applicants. The use of concept papers alsopermits the Institute to better project the nature and amount of grantawards. Because of their importance, the Institute requires all partiesrequesting financial assistance from the Institute (except those seekingrenewal funding pursuant to section IX.) to submit concept papers priorto submitting a formal grant application. This requirement and the submissiondeadlines for concept papers and applications may be waived by the Boardif it determines that time factors or other critical considerations justifythe waiver.A. Format and Content.Concept papers must include a cover sheet and a narrative.1. The cover sheet must contain:a. A title describing the proposed project;b. The name and address of the court, organization or individual submittingthe paper; andc. The name, title, address (if different from that in b.), and telephonenumber of a contact person who can provide further information about thepaper.2. The narrative must be no more than 10 doublespaced pages on 8\1/2\ by11 inch paper. Margins should not be less than 1 inch. The narrative shouldcontain:a. <T3>Program Areas To Be Covered. </T3>A statement which lists the programareas set forth in the State Justice Institute Act, and, if appropriate,the Institute's Special Interest program categories that are addressedby the proposed project. Applicants should explain the proposed project'srelationship to a Program Area or Special Interest Category only if itis not obvious.b. An explanation of the need for the project. If the project is to beconducted in a specific location(s), applicants should discuss the particularneeds of the project site(s) to be addressed by the project and why thoseneeds are not being met through the use of existing materials, programs,procedures, services or other resources.If the project is not site specific, applicants should discuss the problemsthat the proposed project will address, and explain why existing materials,programs, procedures, services or other resources do not adequately resolvethose problems.c. A summary description of the approach to be taken;d. A summary description of how the project will be evaluated, includingthe evaluation criteria;e. A description of the products that will result, the degree to whichthey will be applicable to courts across the nation, and the manner inwhich the products and results of the project will be disseminated;f. An explanation of the expected benefits to be derived from the project;g. The identity of the key staff (if known) and a summary description oftheir qualifications;h. A preliminary budget estimate including the anticipated costs for personnel,fringe benefits, travel, equipment, supplies, contracts, indirect costs,and other anticipated major expenditure categories;i. The amount, nature (cash or non-cash), and source of match to be provided(see section X.B.); and j. A statement of whether financial assistance for the project has beenor will be sought from other sources. 3. The Institute encourages concept paper applicants to attach lettersof cooperation and support from the courts and related agencies that willbe involved in or directly affected by the proposed project. 4. The Institute will not accept concept papers exceeding 10 pages. Thepage limit does not include letters of cooperation or endorsements. Additionalmaterial should not be attached unless it is essential to impart a clearunderstanding of the project. 5. Applicants submitting more than one concept paper may include materialthat would be identical in each concept paper in a cover letter, and incorporatethat material by reference in each paper. The incorporated material willbe counted against the 10-page limit for each paper. A copy of the coverletter should be attached to each copy of each concept paper. B. Selection Criteria1. All concept papers will be evaluated by the staff on the basis of thefollowing criteria: a. The demonstration of need for the project; b. The soundness and innovativeness of the approach described; c. The benefits to be derived from the project; and d. The reasonableness of the proposed budget. 2. ``Special Interest'' category concept papers submitted pursuant to sectionII.B. will also be rated on the proposed project's relationship to oneof the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in that section, and thedegree to which the findings, procedures, training, technology, or otherresults of the project can be transferred to other jurisdictions. 3. ``Single jurisdiction'' concept papers submitted pursuant to sectionII.C. will be rated on the proposed project's relation to one of the ``SpecialInterest'' categories set forth in section II.B., and on the special requirementslisted in section II.C.1. 4. In determining which concept papers will be selected for developmentinto full applications, the Institute will also consider the availabilityof financial assistance from other sources for the project; the amountand nature (cash or in-kind) of the submitter's anticipated match; whetherthe submitter is a ``priority applicant'' under the Institute's enablinglegislation (see 42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1) and section IV above); and the extentto which the proposed project would also benefit the Federal courts orhelp the State courts enforce Federal constitutional and legislative requirements.C. Review ProcessConcept papers will be reviewed competitively by the Board of Directors.Institute staff will prepare a narrative summary and a rating sheet assigningpoints for each relevant selection criterion for those concept papers whichfall within the scope of the Institute's funding program and merit seriousconsideration by the Board. Staff will also prepare a list of those papersthat, in the judgment of the Executive Director, propose projects thatlie outside the scope of the Institute's funding program or are not likelyto merit serious consideration by the Board. The narrative summaries, ratingsheets, and list of non-reviewed papers will be presented to the Boardfor their review. Committees of the Board will review concept paper summarieswithin assigned program areas and prepare recommendations for the fullBoard. The full Board of Directors will then decide which concept paperapplicants should be invited to submit formal applications for funding.The decision to invite an application is solely that of the Board of Directors.D. Submission RequirementsAn original and three copies of all concept papers submitted for considerationin Fiscal Year 1990 must be sent by first class or overnight mail, or bycourier no later than November 30, 1989. A postmark or courier receiptwill constitute evidence of the submission date. All envelopes containingconcept papers should be marked Concept Paper and should be sent to StateJustice Institute, 120 S. Fairfax Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314. Receipt of each concept paper will be acknowledged in writing. Extensionsof the deadline for submission of concept papers will not be granted. The Board expects to meet on March 9-11, 1990, to review the concept papersand invite applications. The Institute will send written notice to allpersons submitting concept papers of the Board's decisions regarding theirpapers and of the key issues and questions that arose during the reviewprocess. A decision by the Board not to invite an application may not beappealed, but does not prohibit resubmission of the concept paper or arevision thereof in a subsequent round of funding. The Institute will alsonotify the designated State contact listed in the Appendix when the Boardinvites applications that are based on concept papers which are submittedby courts within their State or which specify a participating site withintheir State.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Application Requirements for New Projects</ITAG>Except as specified in Section VI, a formal application for a new projectis to be submitted only upon invitation of the Board following review ofa concept paper. An application for Institute funding support must includean application form, budget forms (with appropriate documentation), a projectabstract and program narrative, and certain certifications and assurances.These documents are described below. A. Forms 1. <T3>Application Form </T3>(FORM A)_The application form requests basicinformation regarding the proposed project, the applicant, and the amountof funding support requested. It also requires the signature of an individualauthorized to certify on behalf of the applicant that the information containedin the application is true and complete, that submission of the applicationhas been authorized by the applicant, and that if funding for the proposedproject is approved, the applicant will comply with the requirements andconditions of the award, including the assurances set forth in Form D.2. <T3>Certificate of State Approval</T3> (FORM B)_An application from a Stateor local court must include a copy of FORM B signed by the State's ChiefJudge or Chief Justice, the director of the designated agency, or the headof the designated council.

C. Program Narrative. The program narrative should not exceed 25 double-spaced pages on 8\1/2\by 11 inch paper. Margins should not be less than 1 inch. The page limitdoes not include appendices containing resumes and letters of cooperationor endorsement. Additional background material may be attached only ifit is essential to obtaining a clear understanding of the proposed project.Numerous and lengthy appendices are strongly discouraged. The program narrative should address the following topics: 1. <T3>Project Objectives. </T3>A clear, concise statement of what the proposedproject is intended to accomplish. In stating the objectives of the project,applicants should focus on the overall programmatic objective (e.g., toenhance understanding and skills regarding a specific subject, or to determinehow a certain procedure affects the court and litigants) rather than onoperational objectives (e.g., provide training for 32 judges and courtmanagers, or review data from 300 cases). 2. <T3>Program Areas to be Covered.</T3> A statement which lists the programareas set forth in the State Justice Institute Act, and, if appropriate,the Institute's Special Interest program categories that are addressedby the proposed projects. A discussion should be included only if the relationshipbetween the proposed project and the program areas and special interestcategories is not obvious. 3. <T3>Need for the Project.</T3> If the project is to be conducted in a specificlocation(s), a discussion of the particular needs of the project site(s)to be addressed by the project and why those needs are not being met throughthe use of existing materials, programs, procedures, services or otherresources. If the project is not site specific, a discussion of the problems thatthe proposed project will address, and why existing materials, programs,procedures, services or other resources do not adequately resolve thoseproblems. The discussion should include specific references to the relevantliterature and to the experience in the field. 4. <T3>Tasks, Methods and Evaluation. </T3>a. <T3>Tasks and Methods.</T3> A delineation of the tasks to be performedin achieving the project objectives and the methods to be used for accomplishingeach task. For example: <T3>For research and evaluation projects,</T3> the data sources, data collectionstrategies, variables to be examined, and analytic procedures to be usedfor conducting the research or evaluation and ensuring the validity andgeneral applicability of the results. For projects involving human subjects,the discussion of methods should address the procedures for obtaining respondents'informed consent, ensuring the respondents' privacy and freedom from riskor harm, and the protection of others who are not the subjects of researchbut would be affected by the research. If the potential exists for riskor harm to the human subjects, a discussion should be included of the valueof the proposed research and the methods to be used to minimize or eliminatesuch risk. <T3>For education and training projects,</T3> the adult education techniquesto be used in designing and presenting the training, including the teachingmethods to be used and the opportunities for structured interaction amongthe participants; how faculty will be recruited, selected, and trained;the proposed number and length of the conferences, courses, seminars orworkshops to be conducted; the materials to be provided and how they willbe developed; and the cost to participants. <T3>For demonstration projects,</T3> the demonstration sites and the reasonsthey were selected, or if the sites have not been chosen, how they willbe identified and their cooperation obtained; how the program or procedureswill be implemented and monitored.<T3>For technical assistance projects,</T3> the types of assistance thatwill be provided; the particular program area(s) for which assistance willbe provided; how requests will be obtained and the type of assistance determined;how suitable providers will be selected and briefed; how reports will bereviewed; and the cost to recipients. b. <T3>Evaluation.</T3> Every project design must include an evaluation planto determine whether the project met its objectives. The evaluation shouldbe designed to provide an objective and independent assessment of the effectivenessor usefulness of the training or services provided; the impact of the procedures,technology or services tested; or the validity and applicability of theresearch conducted. The plan should present the qualifications of the evaluator(s);describe the criteria that will be used to evaluate the project's effectiveness;explain how the evaluation will be conducted, including the specific datacollection and analysis techniques to be used; discuss why this approachis appropriate; and present a schedule for completion of the evaluationwithin the proposed project period. The evaluation plan should be appropriate to the type of project proposed.For example, an appropriate evaluation approach for many research projectsis the review of the research methodology, data collection instruments,preliminary analyses, and products as they are drafted by an advisory panelcomprised of independ- ent researchers and practitioners representing theperspectives affected by the proposed project. An appropriate evaluation approach for many education or training projectsis to obtain the reaction of training participants to the quality and effectivenessof faculty presentations, the format of sessions, the value or usefulnessof the material presented and other relevant factors. Another appropriateapproach when an education project involves the development of curricularmaterials is the use of an advisory panel of relevant experts coupled witha test of the curriculum to obtain the reactions of participants and facultyas indicated above. The evaluation plan for a demonstration project should encompass an assessmentof program effectiveness (e.g., how well did it work?); user satisfaction,if appropriate; the cost effectiveness of the program; a process analysisof the program (e.g., was the program implemented as designed? did it providethe services intended to the targeted population?); the impact of the program(e.g., what effect did the program have on the court? what benefits resultedfrom the program?); and the replicability of the program or componentsof the program. For technical assistance projects, applicants should explain how the quality,timeliness, and impact of the assistance provided will be determined. 5. <T3>Project Management.</T3> A detailed management plan including the startingand completion date for each task; the time commitments to the projectof key staff and their responsibilities regarding each project task; andthe procedures that will be used to ensure that all tasks are performedon time, within budget, and at the highest level of quality. The managementplan must also provide for the submission of Quarterly Progress and FinancialReports within 30 days of the close of each calendar quarter (i.e., nolater than January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30). 6. <T3>Products.</T3> A description of the products to be developed by theproject (e.g., monographs, training curricula and materials, videotapes,articles, or handbooks), including when they will be submitted to the Institute.The application must explain how and to whom the products will be disseminated;identify development, production, and dissemination costs covered by theproject budget; and present the basis on which products and services developedor provided under the grant will be offered to the courts community andthe public at large. Ordinarily, the products of a research, evaluation,or demonstration project should include an article summarizing the projectfindings that is publishable in a journal serving the courts communitynationally, an executive summary that will be disseminated to the project'sprimary audience, or both. The products developed by education and trainingprojects should be designed for use outside the classroom so that theymay be used again by original participants and others in the course oftheir duties. Fourteen copies of all project products must be submittedto the Institute. 7. <T3>Applicant Status.</T3> An applicant that is not a State or local courtand has not received a grant from the Institute within the past two yearsshould include a statement indicating whether it is requesting ``prioritystatus'' recognition as either a national non-profit organization controlledby, operating in conjunction with, and serving the judicial branches ofState governments; or a national non-profit organization for the educationand training of State court judges and support personnel.

They are intended to enhance the specific programor service produced or established during the prior grant period. Theymay be used, for example, when a project is divided into two or more sequentialphases, for secondary analysis of data obtained in an Institute-supportedresearch project, or for more extensive testing of an innovative technology,procedure, or program developed with SJI grant support. In order for a project to be considered for continuation funding, the granteemust have completed the project tasks and met all grant requirements andconditions in a timely manner, absent extenuating circumstances or priorInstitute approval of changes to the project design. Continuation grantsare not intended to provide support for a project for which the granteehas underestimated the amount of time or funds needed to accomplish theproject tasks. 2. <T3>Application Procedures_Letters of Intent</T3>. In lieu of a conceptpaper, a grantee seeking a continuation grant must inform the Institute,by letter, of its intent to submit an application for such funding as soonas the need for renewal funding becomes apparent but no less than 120 daysbefore the end of the current grant period. a. A letter of intent must be no more than 3 single-spaced pages on 8\1/2\by 11 inch paper and must contain a concise but thorough explanation ofthe need for continuation; an estimate of the funds to be requested anda brief description of anticipated changes in scope, focus or audienceof the project. b. Letters of intent will not be reviewed competitively. Institute staffwill review the proposed activities for the next project period and, within30 days of receiving a letter of intent, inform the grantee of specificissues to be addressed in the continuation application and the date bywhich the application for a continuation grant must be submitted. 3. <T3>Application Format. </T3>An application for a continuation grant mustinclude an application form, budget forms (with appropriate documentation),a project abstract conforming to the format set forth in section VII.B.,a program narrative, a budget narrative, and certain certifications andassurances. The program narrative should conform to the length and format requirementsset forth in section VII.C. However, rather than the topics listed in sectionVII.C., the program narrative of an application for a continuation grantshould address: a. <T3>Need for Continuation. </T3>Explain why continuation of the projectis necessary to achieve the goals of the project, and how the continuationwill benefit the participating courts or the courts community generally.That is, to what extent will the goals and objectives of the project beunfulfilled if the project is not continued, and conversely, how will thefindings or results of the project be enhanced by continuing the project?b. <T3>Report of Current Project Activities. </T3>Discuss the status of allactivities conducted during the previous project period, identify any activitiesthat were not completed, and explain why. c. <T3>Evaluation Findings. </T3>Describe the key findings or recommendationsresulting from the evaluation of the project, if they are available, andexplain how they will be addressed during the proposed continuation. Ifthe findings are not yet available, provide the date by which they willbe submitted to the Institute. d. <T3>Tasks and Methods. </T3>Describe fully any changes in the tasks tobe performed, the methods to be used, the products of the project, theassigned staff, or the grantee's organizational capacity; e. <T3>Task Schedule. </T3>Present a detailed task schedule and time linefor the next project period. f. <T3>Other Sources of Support. </T3>Indicate why other sources of supportare inadequate, inappropriate or unavailable; andg. <T3>Budget and Budget Narrative. </T3>Provide a complete budget and budgetnarrative conforming to the requirements set forth in paragraph VII.D.Changes in the funding level requested should be discussed in terms ofcorresponding increases or decreases in the scope of activities or servicesto be rendered.4. <T3>References to Previously Submitted Material. </T3>An application fora continuation grant should not repeat information contained in a previouslyapproved application or other previously submitted materials, but shouldprovide specific references to such materials where appropriate.5. <T3>Submission Requirements, Review and Approval Process, and Notificationof Decision. </T3>The submission requirements set forth in section VII.E.,other than the deadline for mailing, apply to applications for a continuationgrant. Such applications will be rated on the selection criteria set forthin section VIII.B. The key findings and recommendations resulting froman evaluation of the project and the proposed response to those findingsand recommendations will also be considered. The review and approval process,return policy, and notification procedures are the same as those for newprojects set forth in sections VIII.C.-VIII.E.C. On-going Support Grants1. <T3>Purpose and Scope. </T3>On-going support grants are intended to supporta project that is national in scope and that provides the State courtswith services, programs or products for which there is a continuing importantneed. On-going support grants are subject to the limits on size and durationset forth in V.B.2. and V.C.2. A project is eligible for considerationfor an on-going support grant if:a. The project is supported by and has been evaluated under a grant fromthe Institute;b. The project is national in scope and provides a significant benefitto the State courts;c. There is a continuing important need for the services, programs or productsprovided by the project as indicated by the level of use and support bymembers of the court community;d. The project is accomplishing its objectives in an effective and efficientmanner; ande. It is likely that the service or program provided by the project wouldbe curtailed or significantly reduced without Institute support.Each project supported by an on-going support grant must include an evaluationcomponent assessing its effectiveness and operation throughout the grantperiod. A comprehensive evaluation report must be completed not less than90 days before the end of the grant period. In addition, a detailed annualtask schedule must be submitted for Institute approval within 30 days afterthe end of each project year.2. <T3>Application Procedures_Letters of Intent. </T3>The Board will considerawarding an on-going support grant for a period of up to 36 months.

Such applications will be rated on the selection criteriaset forth in section VIII.B. The key findings and recommendations resultingfrom an evaluation of the project and the proposed response to those findingsand recommendations will also be considered. The review and approval process,return policy, and notification procedures are the same as those for newprojects set forth in sections VIII.C.-VIII.E.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Compliance Requirements</ITAG>The State Justice Institute Act (Pub.

Supervision and Monitoring Responsibilities1. <T3>Grantee Responsibilities. </T3>All grantees receiving direct awardsfrom the Institute are responsible for the management and fiscal controlof all funds. Responsibilities include the accounting for receipts andexpenditures, the maintaining of adequate financial records and the refundingof expenditures disallowed by audits.2. <T3>Responsibilities of State Supreme Court. </T3>Each application forfunding from a State or local court must be approved, consistent with Statelaw, by the State's Supreme Court, or its designated agency or council.The State Supreme Court shall receive all Institute funds awarded to suchcourts and shall be responsible for assuring proper administration of Institutefunds. The State Supreme Court is responsible for all aspects of the project,including proper accounting and financial recordkeeping by the subgrantee.The responsibilities include:a. <T3>Reviewing Financial Operations. </T3>The State Supreme Court shouldbe familiar with, and periodically monitor, its subgrantees' financialoperations, records system and procedures. Particular attention shouldbe directed to the maintenance of current financial data.b. <T3>Recording Financial Activities. </T3>The subgrantee's grant award orcontract obligation, as well as cash advances and other financial activities,should be recorded in the financial records of the State Supreme Courtin summary form. Subgrantee expenditures should be recorded on the booksof the State Supreme Court <T3>OR </T3>evidenced by report forms duly filed by the subgrantee. Non-Institutecontributions applied to projects by subgrantees should likewise be recorded,as should any project income resulting from program operations.c. <T3>Budgeting and Budget Review. </T3>The State Supreme Court should ensurethat each subgrantee prepares an adequate budget as the basis for its awardcommitment. The detail of each project budget should be maintained on fileby the State Supreme Court.d. <T3>Accounting for Non-Institute Contributions. </T3>The State SupremeCourt will ensure, in those instances where subgrantees are required tofurnish non-Institute matching funds, that the requirements and limitationsof this guideline are applied to such funds.e. <T3>Audit Requirement. </T3>The State Supreme Court is required to ensurethat subgrantees have met the necessary audit requirements as set forthby the Institute (see sections X.J. and XI.J).f. <T3>Reporting Irregularities. </T3>The State Supreme Court and its subgranteesare responsible for promptly reporting to the Institute the nature andcircumstances surrounding any financial irregularities discovered.C. Accounting SystemThe grantee is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequatesystem of accounting and internal controls for itself and for ensuringthat an adequate system exists for each of its subgrantees and contractors.An acceptable and adequate accounting system is considered to be one which:1. Properly accounts for receipt of funds under each grant awarded andthe expenditure of funds for each grant by category of expenditure (includingmatching contributions and project income);2. Assures that expended funds are applied to the appropriate budget categoryincluded within the approved grant;3. Presents and classifies historical costs of the grant as required forbudgetary and evaluation purposes;4. Provides cost and property controls to assure optimal use of grant funds;5.

Meets the prescribed requirements for periodic financial reporting ofoperations; and7. Provides financial data for planning, control, measurement, and evaluationof direct and indirect costs.D. Total Cost Budgeting and AccountingAccounting for all funds awarded by the Institute shall be structured andexecuted on a ``total project cost'' basis. That is, total project costs,including Institute funds, State and local matching shares, and any otherfund sources included in the approved project budget shall be the foundationfor fiscal administration and accounting. Grant applications and financialreports require budget and cost estimates on the basis of total costs.1. <T3>Timing of Matching Contributions. </T3>Matching contributions neednot be applied at the exact time of the obligation of Institute funds.However, the full matching share must be obligated by the end of the periodfor which the Institute funds have been made available for obligation underan approved project. In instances where a proposed cash match contributionis not fully met, the Institute may reduce the award amount accordingly,in order to maintain the ratio originally provided for in the award agreement.2. <T3>Records for Match. </T3>All grantees must maintain records which clearlyshow the source, amount, and timing of all matching contributions. In addition,if a project has included, within its approved budget, contributions whichexceed the required matching portion, the grantee must maintain recordsof those contributions in the same manner as it does the Institute fundsand required matching shares. For all grants made to State and local courts,the State Supreme Court has primary responsibility for grantee/subgranteecompliance with the requirements of this section. (See XI.B.2.)E. Maintenance and Retention of RecordsAll financial records, supporting documents, statistical records and allother records pertinent to grants, subgrants, cooperative agreements orcontracts under grants shall be retained by each organization participatingin a project for at least three years for purposes of examination and audit.State Supreme Courts may impose record retention and maintenance requirementsin addition to those prescribed in this chapter.1. <T3>Coverage. </T3>The retention requirement extends to books of originalentry, source documents supporting accounting transactions, the generalledger, subsidiary ledgers, personnel and payroll records, cancelled checks,and related documents and records. Source documents include copies of allgrant and subgrant awards, applications, and required grantee/subgranteefinancial and narrative reports. Personnel and payroll records shall includethe time and attendance reports for all individuals reimbursed under agrant, subgrant or contract, whether they are employed full-time or part-time.Time and effort reports will be required for consultants.2. <T3>Retention Period. </T3>The three-year retention period starts fromthe date of the submission of the final expenditure report or, for grantswhich are renewed annually, from the date of submission of the annual expenditurereport.3. <T3>Maintenance. </T3>Grantees and subgrantees are expected to see thatrecords of different fiscal years are separately identified and maintainedso that requested information can be readily located. Grantees and subgranteesare also obligated to protect records adequately against fire or otherdamage. When records are stored away from the grantee's/subgrantee's principaloffice, a written index of the location of stored records should be onhand, and ready access should be assured.F. Project-Related IncomeRecords of the receipt and disposition of project-related income must bemaintained by the grantee in the same manner as required for the projectfunds that gave rise to the income. The policies governing the dispositionof the various types of project-related income are listed below.1. <T3>Interest. </T3>A State and any agency or instrumentality of a Stateincluding State institutions of higher education and State hospitals, shallnot be held accountable for interest earned on advances of project funds.When funds are awarded to subgrantees through a State, the subgranteesare not held accountable for interest earned on advances of project funds.Local units of government that are direct grantees and nonprofit organizationsmust refund any interest earned. Grantees shall so order their affairsto ensure minimum balances in their respective grant cash accounts.2. <T3>Royalties. </T3>The grantee/subgrantee may retain all royalties receivedfrom copyrights or other works developed under projects or from patentsand inventions, unless the terms and conditions of the project provideotherwise.3. <T3>Registration and tuition fees. </T3>Registration and tuition fees shallbe used to pay project-related costs not covered by the grant, or to reducethe amount of grant funds needed to support the project. Registration andtuition fees may be used for other purposes only with the prior writtenapproval of the Institute.4. <T3>Other. </T3>Other project income shall be treated in accordance withdisposition instructions set forth in the project's terms and conditions.G. Payments and Financial Reporting Requirements1. <T3>Payment of Grant Funds. </T3>The procedures and regulations set forthbelow are applicable to all Institute grant funds and grantees.a. <T3>Request for Advance or Reimbursement of Funds. </T3>Grantees will receivefunds on a ``Check-Issued'' basis. Upon receipt, review, and approval ofa Request for Advance or Reimbursement by the Institute, a check will beissued directly to the grantee or its designated fiscal agent. A requestmust be limited to the grantee's immediate cash needs. The Request forAdvance or Reimbursement, along with the instructions for its preparation,will be included in the official Institute award package.<T3>b. Termination of Advance Funding. </T3>When a grantee organizationreceiving cash advances from the Institute:i. Demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to attain program or projectgoals, or to establish procedures that will minimize the time elapsingbetween cash advances and disbursements, or cannot adhere to guidelinerequirements or special conditions;ii. Engages in the improper award and administration of subgrants or contracts;oriii. Is unable to submit reliable and/or timely reports, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">the Institute may terminate advance financing and require the granteeorganization to finance its operations with its own working capital. Paymentsto the grantee shall then be made by the use of the Institute check methodto reimburse the grantee for actual cash disbursements. In the event thegrantee continues to be deficient, the Institute reserves the right tosuspend payments until the deficiencies are corrected.c. <T3>Principle of Minimum Cash on Hand. </T3>Recipient organizations shouldrequest funds based upon immediate disbursement requirements. Granteesshould time their requests to ensure that cash on hand is the minimum neededfor disbursements to be made immediately or within a few days. Idle fundsin the hands of subgrantees will impair the goals of good cash management.2. <T3>Financial Reporting. </T3>In order to obtain financial informationconcerning the use of funds, the Institute requires that grantees/subgranteesof these funds submit timely reports for review.Two copies of the Financial Status Report are required from all granteesfor each active quarter on a calendar-quarter basis. This report is duewithin 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter. It is designedto provide financial information relating to Institute funds, State andlocal matching shares, and any other fund sources included in the approvedproject budget. The report contains information on obligations as wellas outlays. A copy of the Financial Status Report, along with instructionsfor its preparation, will be included in the official Institute Award package.In circumstances where an organization requests substantial payments fora project prior to the completion of a given quarter, the Institute mayrequest a brief summary of the amount requested, by object class, in supportof the Request for Advance or Reimbursement.3. <T3>Consequences of Non-Compliance with Submission Requirements. </T3>Failureof the grantee organization to submit required financial and program reportsmay result in a suspension of grant payments.H. Allowability of Costs1. <T3>General. </T3>Except as may be otherwise provided in the conditionsof a particular grant, cost allowability shall be determined in accordancewith the principles set forth in <T3>OMB Circulars A-87</T3>, Cost Principles for State and Local Governments;<T3>A-21</T3>. Cost Principles Applicable to Grants and Contracts withEducational Institutions; and <T3>A-122</T3>, Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.2. <T3>Costs Requiring Prior Approval. </T3>a. <T3>Preagreement Costs. </T3>The written prior approval of the Instituteis required for costs which are considered necessary to the project butoccur prior to the starting date of the grant period.b. <T3>Equipment. </T3>Grant funds may be used to purchase or lease only thatequipment which is essential to accomplishing the goals and objectivesof the project. The written prior approval of the Institute is requiredwhen the amount of automated data processing (ADP) equipment to be purchasedor leased exceeds $10,000 or the software to be purchased exceeds $3,000.c. <T3>Consultants. </T3>The written prior approval of the Institute is requiredwhen the rate of compensation to be paid a consultant exceeds $200 a day.3. <T3>Travel Costs. </T3>Transportation and per diem rates must comply withthe policies of the applicant organization. If the applicant does not havean established written travel policy, then travel rates shall be consistentwith those established by the Institute or the Federal Government. Institutefunds shall not be used to cover the transportation or per diem costs ofa member of a national organization to attend an annual or other regularmeeting of that organization.4. <T3>Indirect Costs. </T3>These are costs of an organization that are notreadily assignable to a particular project, but are necessary to the operationof the organization and the performance of the project. The cost of operatingand maintaining facilities, depreciation, and administrative salaries areexamples of the types of costs that are usually treated as indirect costs.It is the policy of the Institute that all costs should be budgeted directly;however, if a recipient has an indirect cost rate approved by a Federalagency as set forth below, the Institute will accept that rate.a. <T3>Approved Plan Available. </T3>(1) The Institute will accept an indirectcost rate or allocation plan approved for a grantee during the precedingtwo years by any Federal granting agency on the basis of allocation methodssubstantially in accord with those set forth in the applicable cost circulars.A copy of the approved rate agreement must be submitted to the Institute.(2) Where flat rates are accepted in lieu of actual indirect costs, granteesmay not also charge expenses normally included in overhead pools, e.g.,accounting services, legal services, building occupancy and maintenance,etc., as direct costs.(3) Organizations with an approved indirect cost rate, utilizing totaldirect costs as the base, usually exclude contracts under grants from anyoverhead recovery. The negotiation agreement will stipulate that contractsare excluded from the base for overhead recovery.b. <T3>Establishment of Indirect Cost Rates. </T3>In order to be reimbursedfor indirect costs, a grantee or organization must first establish an appropriateindirect cost rate. To do this, the grantee must prepare an indirect costrate proposal and submit it to the Institute. The proposal must be submittedin a timely manner (within three months after the start of the grant period)to assure recovery of the full amount of allowable indirect costs, andit must be developed in accordance with principles and procedures appropriateto the type of grantee institution involved.c. <T3>No Approved Plan. </T3>If an indirect cost proposal for recovery ofactual indirect costs is not submitted to the Institute within three monthsafter the start of the grant period, indirect costs will be irrevocablydisallowed for all months prior to the month that the indirect cost proposalis received. This policy is effective for all grant awards.I. Procurement and Property Management Standards 1. <T3>Procurement Standards. </T3>For State and local governments, the Instituteis adopting the standards set forth in Attachment O of <T3>OMB Circular A-102</T3>. Institutions of higher education, hospitals,and other non-profit organizations will be governed by the standards setforth in Attachment O of <T3>OMB Circular A-110.</T3>2. <T3>Property Management Standards. </T3>The property management standardsas prescribed in Attachment N of <T3>OMB Circulars A-102 </T3>and <T3>A-110 </T3>shall be applicable to all grantees and subgrantees of Institutefunds except as provided in subsection b. below.a. <T3>Acquisition. </T3>All grantees/subgrantees are required to be prudentin the acquisition and management of property with grant funds. If suitableproperty required for the successful execution of projects is already availablewithin the grantee or subgrantee organization, expenditures of grant fundsfor the acquisition of new property will be considered unnecessary.b. <T3>Title to Property. </T3>At the conclusion of the project, title toall expendable and nonexpendable personal property purchased with Institutefunds shall vest in the court, organization, or individual that purchasedthe property if certification is made to the Institute that the propertywill continue to be used for the authorized purposes of the Institute-fundedproject or other purposes consistent with the State Justice Institute Act,as approved by the Institute. If such certification is not received, orthe Institute disapproves such certification, title to all such propertywith an aggregate or individual value of $1,000 or more shall vest in theInstitute, which will direct the disposition of the property.J. Audit Requirements1. <T3>Audit Objectives. </T3>Grants and other agreements are awarded subjectto conditions of fiscal, program and general administration to which therecipient expressly agrees. Accordingly, the audit objective is to reviewthe grantee's or subgrantee's administration of grant funds and requirednon-Institute contributions for the purpose of determining whether therecipient has:a. Established an accounting system integrated with adequate internal fiscaland management controls to provide full accountability for revenues, expenditures,assets, and liabilities;b. Prepared financial statements which are presented fairly, in accordancewith generally accepted accounting principles;c. Prepared Institute financial reports (including Financial Status Reports,Cash Reports, and Requests for Advances and Reimbursements) which containaccurate and reliable financial data, and are presented in accordance withprescribed procedures; andd. Expended Institute funds in accordance with the terms of applicableagreements and those provisions of Federal law or Institute regulationsthat could have a material effect on the financial statements or on theawards tested.2. <T3>Implementation. </T3>Each grantee (including a State or local courtreceiving a subgrant from the State Supreme Court) shall provide for anannual fiscal audit. The audit may be of the entire grantee organization(e.g., a university) or of the specific project funded by the Institute.The audit shall be conducted by an independent Certified Public Accountant,or a State or local agency authorized to audit government agencies. Theaudit shall be conducted in compliance with generally accepted auditingstandards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.A written report shall be prepared upon completion of the audit. Granteesare responsible for submitting copies of the reports to the Institute withinthirty days after the acceptance of the report by the grantee, for eachyear that there is financial activity involving Institute funds.Grantees who receive funds from a Federal agency and who satisfy auditrequirements of the cognizant Federal agency, should submit a copy of theaudit report prepared for that Federal agency to the Institute in orderto satisfy the provisions of this section. Cognizant Federal agencies donot send reports to the Institute. Therefore, each grantee must send thisreport directly to the Institute.Audit reports from nonprofit organizations which do not receive Federalfunds, and which decide to perform an audit of the entire organization,shall include a supplemental schedule depicting a project-by-project summaryof Institute grant activity for the audit period. At a minimum, this summaryshould include the grant award number, project title, award amount, paymentsreceived, expenditures made and balances remaining. The auditors shouldalso conduct adequate tests to ensure that the audit objectives listedin sections XI.J.1. c. and d. above have been satisfied.3. <T3>Resolution and Clearance of Audit Reports. </T3>Timely action on recommendationsby responsible management officials is an integral part of the effectivenessof an audit. Each grant recipient shall have policies and procedures foracting on audit recommendations by designating officials responsible for:follow-up, maintaining a record of the actions taken on recommendationsand time schedules, responding to and acting on audit recommendations,and submitting periodic reports to the Institute on recommendations andactions taken.4. <T3>Consequences of Non-Resolution of Audit Issues. </T3>It is the generalpolicy of the State Justice Institute not to make new grant awards to anapplicant having an unresolved audit report involving Institute awards.Failure of the grantee organization to resolve audit questions may alsoresult in the suspension of payments for active Institute grants to thatorganization.K. Close-Out of Grants1. <T3>Definition. </T3>Close-out is a process by which the Institute determinesthat all applicable administrative and financial actions and all requiredwork of the grant have been completed by both the grantee and the Institute.2. <T3>Grantee Close-Out Requirements. </T3>Within 90 days after the end dateof the grant or any approved extension thereof (revised end date), thefollowing documents must be submitted by the grantee to the Institute.a. <T3>Financial Status Report. </T3>The final report of expenditures musthave no unliquidated obligations and must indicate the exact balance ofunobligated funds. Any unobligated/unexpended funds will be deobligatedfrom the award by the Institute. Grantees on a check-issued basis, whohave drawn down funds in excess of their obligations/expenditures, mustreturn any unused funds as soon as it is determined that the funds arenot required. In no case should any unused funds remain with the granteebeyond the submission date of the final financial status report.b. <T3>Final Progress Report. </T3>This report should describe the projectactivities during the final calendar quarter of the project and the closeoutperiod, including to whom project products have been disseminated; specifywhether all the objectives set forth in the approved application or anapproved adjustment thereto have been met, and, if any of the objectiveshave not been met; explain the reasons therefor.<ITAG tagnum="84">XII.
