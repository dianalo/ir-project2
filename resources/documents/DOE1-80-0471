(1) In 1987, the international petroleum market witnessed lowerprice variations than in the previous year; however, the WTI spot pricechanged considerably. (2) The Iran-Iraq war entered a stage of internationalconflict involving the US, USSR, European countries, and Arab countries.There is no longer power for maintaining the 18-dollar petroleum priceframework; however, policies for raising the price will not be adopted.(3) Short- and middle-term prediction of crude oil price -- in 1988,the price will be about 17 dollars somewhat lower than 17.40 to 17.50dollars in 1987; if the attempt to reduce production is not successful,the price may drop below 15 dollars. In middle-term prediction, the pricewill not reach the level of 22 dollars (based on high-price prediction)in 1990, but will be about 20 dollars because production from developmentcountries is not expected to drop and the petroleum demand is not expectedto increase much.
