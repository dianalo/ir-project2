Ayre, Sue.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>ToolkitsandM;edited by Trudy NeuhausandM;Zinc Delivers a Robust Interface Library For Windows Application DevelopmentandM;The Zinc Interface Library (ZIL), Version 2.0, is a significant upgrade of1.01, which remains one of the finest Candplus;andplus; class libraries available forinterface design.andP;  With this release, Zinc Software adds support for Windowsapplication development to its support for DOS character and graphics modes.andO;It features Zinc Designer, a screen designer for visually and interactivelycreating user interfaces, and it has given its objects persistence.andP;  Anobject that just exists in memory for the duration of a given program orsubroutine is said to be transient.andP;  If an object is stored on-disk in such away that it exists outside of any program, it is persistent.andP;  Because Zincinterface objects such as icons and buttons are persistent, they can beconveniently stored on-disk.andM;Zinc Software consistently delivers on the promise of OOP.andP;  Its classlibraries shield the developer from many of the intricate details of GUIprogramming.andP;  For example, Zinc manages details such as which video adapter(VGA and so on) and which target video mode (DOS graphics or text modes, orWindows) is being used.andP;  It does this by using a display class (an abstractclass) called UI_DISPLAY to define the general features needed for screenoutput.andP;  Four classes are derived from UI_DISPLAY, and each class handles oneof four modes: Borland graphics, Zortech graphics, Microsoft Windows, ortext.andP;  So instead of writing code to handle the low-level details of thevideo interface, programmers can focus on high-level issues such as userinterface design.andM;To connect ZIL to your program or application, you need to write or call thecode that activates the screen you build in the screen designer.andP;  You have tobuild an event manager and then add the necessary devices, build a windowmanager and add windows.andP;  In keeping with the nature of object-orientedprogramming, on-screen windows are built by creating an instance of a windowobject.andP;  Once you have done all this, you can just let Zinc, like any otherWindows program, manage the events.andP;  The event loop cycles patiently, waitingfor something to happen.andP;  When an event occurs, the event manager interpretsit and sends the interpreted information to the window manager via the eventqueue, which passes the information to the appropriate window, which actsaccordingly.andM;We compiled a simple Hello program to compare the size and speed of a ZILprogram in its different modes, and to compare it with a few other simpleprograms.andP;  As you would expect, the size of the .EXE files increased as thetarget environment became more complicated.andP;  The Zinc Hello programs wereabout 100K in text mode, 124K in graphics mode, and 130K for Windows.andP;  TheWindows Hello program that comes with Borland Candplus;andplus; compiles to only 16K, but asimilar Blaise Winandplus;andplus; (another Windows class library) Hello program compilesto 150K.andM;Although these program sizes may seem huge, they're really quite acceptable.andO;The first window object your program uses will increase the size of yourprogram disproportionately, because it pulls in all code related to windowobjects.andP;  However, subsequent window objects of the same or a similar kindwill hardly increase your program's size since much of the code they need isalready in your program.andP;  In addition, we found no execution degradationresulting from an increase in size.andM;The Zinc Interface Library is a robust set of tools, yet it's not quite theperfect world that Zinc portrays in its ads.andP;  While ZIL can teach youobject-oriented design, there's no way to avoid learning Windows programmingif you want to build Windows applications.andP;  It is true that you no longerneed the Windows  SDK (you can thank Borland for that).andP;  But, you can'texpect to do serious Windows development without the Windows referencemanuals (available from Microsoft Press) and a definite commitment to thiscourse of study.andM;As an example, the ZIL virtual function UI_WINDOWS_DIS-PLAY::Text draws texton the screen using the Windows function TextOut().andP;  Unless you have somereference that describes the way TextOut() works, using the ZIL interface todo it is an exercise in iterative trial-and-error programming.andP;  Further, theZinc documentation states &quot;This function uses the Microsoft WindowsText-Out() function with the following modifications:&quot; whereupon it liststhree important differences between ZIL's function and TextOut().andP;  Clearly,you are expected to know how TextOut() works; otherwise the directions in theuse of the ZIL Windows display function make no sense.andM;Version 2.0's documentation has been redesigned and significantly expanded.andO;Unfortunately, it makes a lot of assumptions about what a programmer knows,burying simple details in hard-to-find places.andM;For example, we had trouble finding a succinct description of what codechanges needed to be made to a program even a sample program so it wouldcompile as a Windows application.andP;  Since this feature is advertised heavily,you would think this information would be emblazoned on the manuals.andM;We recommend ZIL highly, with some qualifications.andP;  The manuals are good,better than in any previous release, but there's still room for improvementin their indexing and organizational schemes.andP;  Second, Zinc takes anontraditional approach to window objects.andP;  There are no resources and noresource files.andP;  Instead, in order to maintain compatibility across all threeplatforms, Zinc uses persistent objects.andP;  Third, you must use the largememory model when you compile Windows programs with ZIL.andP;  Some  Windows'developers may consider the large model an unacceptable limitation, but it isa Windows limitation having to do with the way DLLs handle memory, and onethat class library support is likely to require for the foreseeable future.andM;Zinc can teach you object-oriented programming and GUI design.andP;  It cannotteach you Windows programming.andP;  However, when it comes to class libraries,the Zinc Interface Library is as good as it gets, which is very, verygood.--Rick and Sue AyreandM;Zinc Interface Library, Version 2.0.andM;List Price: $299.95;
