Determination to Issue an Interim Rule</ITAG><T3>FAC 84-45, Item II. </T3>A determination has been made under authorityof the Secretary of Defense (DoD), the Administrator of General Services(GSA), and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) to issue the regulations in Item II of FAC 84-45 as an interim rule.This action is necessary because the new statutory definition was effectiveon the date of enactment of Pub. L. 100-679, which was November 17, 1988.Accordingly, it is necessary to implement the definition in the FederalAcquisition Regulation as soon as possible.DoD, GSA, and NASA have determined that compelling reasons exist to promulgatean interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. However,pursuant to Pub. L. 98-577 and FAR 1.501, public comments received in responseto this interim rule will be considered in formulating a final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Background</ITAG><T3>FAC 84-45, Item I. </T3>Pub. L. 100-496, the Prompt Payment Act Amendmentsof 1988, significantly changes the bill paying practices of the FederalGovernment. The law provides that these changes apply to contracts awarded,contracts renewed, and contract options exercised after March 31, 1989.This final rule contains changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulationto incorporate the required revisions. These revisions include: (1) Eliminationof the 15-day grace period during which the Government was entitled tomake invoice payments without incurring interest penalties; (2) establishmentof an additional penalty if a contractor is not paid an interest penaltyowed by the Government; (3) establishment of a 15-day payment period forcontracts providing for ``fast payment'' procedures; (4) a requirementthat construction contract progress payments generally be paid within 14days; and (5) a requirement for specific provisions to be included in constructionsubcontracts.<ITAG tagnum="84">C.

A Final Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis has been prepared and is on file in the FAR Secretariat. The FinalAnalysis will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small BusinessAdministration.<T3>FAC 84-45, Item II. </T3>The revisions of andSection;andSection; 36.102and 36.601 of the FAR implement a statutory amendment that Congress hasstated is intended to clarify the statutory definition of A-E services,rather than expand that definition. Accordingly, the revision is not expectedto have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities, and an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has not been prepared.However, comments received from small entities concerning the affectedsections will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act.Such comments must be submitted separately and cite section 89-610 pertainingto Item II of FAC 84-45.<ITAG tagnum="84">D.

Agencies shall pay aninterest penalty, without request from the contractor, for late invoicepayments or improperly taken discounts for prompt payment. The interestpenalty shall be absorbed within funds available for administration oroperation of the program for which the penalty was incurred. The temporaryunavailability of funds to make a timely payment does not relieve the obligationto pay interest penalties.

In the event that actual acceptanceoccurs within the constructive acceptance period, the determination ofan interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance. Theconstructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Governmentofficials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administrationfunctions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.Except in the case of a contract for the procurement of a brand name commercialitem for authorized resale (e.g., commissary items), the contracting officermay specify a longer period for constructive acceptance in the solicitationand resulting contract, if required to afford the Government a reasonableopportunity to inspect and test the property furnished or to evaluate theservices performed. The contract file shall indicate the justificationfor extending the constructive acceptance period beyond 7 days.(iii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment(e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in thecontract.

(ii) The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services completedby the contractor. On a final invoice where the payment amount is subjectto contract settlement actions (e.g., release of claims), acceptance shallbe deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the settlement. Forthe sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due thecontractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred constructivelyon the 7th day after the contractor has completed the work or servicesin accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract (see also 32.905(b)(4)).In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptanceperiod, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on theactual date of acceptance. (2) The due date for progress payments shall be the 30th day after Governmentapproval of contractor estimates of work or services accomplished. Forthe sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due thecontractor, Government approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructivelyon the 7th day after contractor estimates have been received by the designatedbilling office (see also 32.905(b)(4)).

The contracting officer may specify a longer period in thesolicitation and resulting contract if required to afford the Governmenta reasonable opportunity to adequately inspect the work and to determinethe adequacy of the contractor's performance under the contract. The contractfile shall indicate the justification for extending the due date beyond14 days.

If the invoice does not comply with theserequirements, then the contractor must be notified of the defect within7 days (3 days on contracts for meat and meat food products, and 5 dayson contracts for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, ediblefats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils) afterreceipt of the invoice at the designated billing office. The reason thatthe invoice is not a proper invoice must be specified. If such notice isnot timely, then an adjusted due date for the purpose of determining aninterest penalty, if any, will be established in accordance with 32.907-1(b):(1) Name and address of the contractor.(2) Invoice date.(3) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or servicesperformed (including order number and contract line item number).(4) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended priceof supplies delivered or services performed.(5) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of shipment,prompt payment discount terms).

If the designated billing officefailed to notify the contractor of a defective invoice within the periodsprescribed in 32.905(e), then the due date on the corrected invoice willbe adjusted by subtracting the number of days taken beyond the prescribednotification of defects period from the payment due date. Any interestpenalty owed the contractor will be based on this adjusted due date.(c) An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated paymentoffice, without request from the contractor, if a discount for prompt paymentis taken improperly. The interest penalty shall be calculated on the amountof discount taken for the period beginning with the first day after theend of the discount period through the date when the contractor is paid.(d) The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretaryof the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except wherethe interest penalty is prescribed by other governmental authority (e.g.,tariffs). The rate in effect on the day after the due date shall remainfixed during the period for which an interest penalty is calculated. Thisrate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' and itis published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1.The interest penalty will accrue daily on the invoice payment amount approvedby the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive fromthe first day after the due date through the payment date. That is, interestaccrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoicepayment amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in thesucceeding 30-day period. The interest penalty amount, interest rate andthe period for which the interest penalty was computed, will be separatelystated by the designated payment office on the check, in accompanying remittanceadvice, or, in the case of wire transfers, by an appropriate electronicdata message accompanying the wire transfer.
