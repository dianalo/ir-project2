The minister's statement, carried by the official Saudi pressagency, said that low oil prices brought on by overproductionrequire joint action ``to bring prosperity to our nation andcountries.''   The report did not outline what plan Nazer might present duringthe meeting, called to forge a joint strategy to help OPEC prop updeteriorating oil prices.   Four of the six GCC members _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar andthe United Arab Emirates _ are ranking members of the 13-nationOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. While GCC membersOman and Bahrain are not part of OPEC, their economies depend onoil export revenues.   The meeting at GCC headquarters here began early Sunday evening.The ministers did not speak to reporters before the single sessionbegan.   A worldwide oil glut has sent crude prices tumbling as much as$8 below the $18-a-barrel OPEC benchmark. Much of the excess crudecomes from Gulf producers, including Iraq and Iran.   OPEC members collectively are pumping more than 3 millionbarrels in excess of the aggregate ceiling the cartel agreed to inlate 1986 to try to defend the $18 price.   Many producers have openly ignored their quotas. The United ArabEmirates, for example, renounced its 948,000-barrel-a-day quota andis pumping about 1.5 million barrels daily.   Saudi Arabia announced it will no longer cut production andsacrifice its revenue to defend prices. It has exceeded its quotaof 4.3 million barrels per day in recent weeks to pressure otheroverproducers into respecting the quota system.   Industry executives and Western diplomats believe that the GCCministers have to discuss their own quotas and consider means ofcoercing Iraq and Iran into cooperating.   The two countries are emerging from an 8-year war; both havesaid they will pump as much oil as they deem necessary to financebillions of dollars in reconstruction.   Iraq has suggested it will cooperate with OPEC. Iran'sparliamentary speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said Friday that therewas ``no reason to quarrel with the countries on the southern coastof the Gulf'' over the oil market.   ``If we quarrel, the situation will remain as it is now. Whyshould oil sell at $10 or $11?''   The Saudi newspaper Arab News noted that Iraq and Iran want``really high revenue, be it by pumping or through high prices bycooperating and cutting prooduction.''   The paper said producers are considering raising the OPECceiling by raising members' quotas, but such an arrangement has towait for the upcoming meeting of OPEC's strategy committee.   If all these efforts fail to stem the overproduction problem,``we are poised for another price crash,'' a senior oil source toldthe paper.</TEXT></DOC>
