But for Mr. Kohl's center-right coalition, which easily won a second term in last Sunday's elections, there is at least one critical area that can't carry on as before. The new government concedes that it will have to prop up the two main pillars of Germany's elaborate welfare state.    That isn't the only problem the Kohl government faces. A hostage crisis in Lebanon and fears of a trade war with the U.S. will dominate the first days of Mr. Kohl's second term. And a rising mark, which is slowing German exports, makes the economic outlook uncertain. But resolving the welfare system's difficulties makes the other problems look simple.    Since the days of Bismarck, Germany has been known for the generosity of its social-welfare programs. Today the state provides womb-to-tomb coverage: It pays for birth and maternity care, gives parents a monthly stipend for each child, offers free university education, provides virtually free prescription drugs and even contributes about $2,000 to funeral costs.    But the country's two most expensive and cherished welfare programs -- old-age pensions and medical insurance -- have become untenable. Together the two account for about two-thirds of total German welfare spending, which has ballooned within three decades to more than $250 billion, or about a third of the nation's total economic output. Now, a looming demographic imbalance threatens to bankrupt the entire system.    How Germany deals with its social-welfare problem will largely determine the fate of Europe's biggest economy. Hence, the issue is of critical importance to the U.S. and the rest of Europe. Unless a solution is found, German citizens and businesses will have fewer marks to spend and save, which could further damage already strained trade and financial relations with the U.S. Such a scenario might also intensify strains in the military alliance as runaway welfare spending conflicts with defense commitments.    The difficulty of altering the welfare system could also undermine Mr. Kohl's plans to implement a tax-cutting package, a major objective for his second term. &quot;It's no use reducing taxes if nothing is done to stem the explosive rise of welfare contributions,&quot; Mr. Kohl said last week.    The financing of social benefits is a world-wide problem, but it is particularly severe in the entrenched welfare states of Europe. In West Germany, which ranks near the top of big welfare spenders among Western industrialized nations, the problem has grown acute because of the size of the welfare state and its inertia. Germany pays out 50% more in welfare benefits than the U.S., as a proportion of economic output. Its social-welfare budget outstrips that of Japan, even though Japan's economy is roughly twice the size of Germany's.    Over the next decade or so, demographic trends could sink the system. At present, there are about three working Germans for each person over 60 years old; that proportion will slip to two to one early in the next century. A growing proportion of old people, many of whom need expensive health care, will rely on a dwindling number of workers for financial support.    Since 1970, the amount deducted from workers' paychecks for pension, health and unemployment benefits has risen by one-third to an average 18% of gross pay. Experts warn that early in the next century, benefits will have to be halved or contributions doubled to maintain the system as it is now structured.    Some Germans are already concluding it just isn't worth it. &quot;I can do better in a private pension plan,&quot; says pharmacist Wolfgang Lahmer, who as a self-employed worker can choose whether to participate. Mr. Lahmer, in his early 40s, contributed to the state pension plan for five years and will collect nothing unless he pays in for 10 more. But even with the potential loss of what he has already contributed, he can do better elsewhere.    While most agree that dramatic change is essential, though, the outlook for it is bleak. Previous governments have tried to tinker. Since 1975, Bonn has passed almost 30 laws to curb spending, with little effect. In any case, European governments reduce social welfare at their peril, as the Irish government discovered last week when it fell trying to implement spending cuts. In Germany, more than 80% of private households receive at least one public transfer payment, and pensioners alone represent 26% of the electorate.    What follows is an examination of the German pension and health-insurance programs.    Pensions   By international standards, Guenter Kundruhn is enjoying a generous retirement. The 67-year-old former civil servant, who lives with his wife in Bonn, contributed to Germany's old-age pension system for 22 years.    Today he and his wife get two pensions -- one for his mid-level government job, the other the standard state pension. Together the pensions total almost $30,000 a year at present exchange rates, and under Germany's taxation rules -- which penalize just about everyone except retirees -- the Kundruhns pay virtually no tax on their income.    As a result, the couple's net income is about equal to what it was when Mr. Kundruhn was working full time. (Until a few years ago, before a change in the pension law, many retirees actually earned more in retirement than working.) Mr. Kundruhn says he is able to save money and reckons that he is better off financially than three of his four children. He still helps to support his youngest child, a 27-year-old daughter, giving her about $300 each month.    &quot;I'm pretty fortunate,&quot; Mr. Kundruhn says, &quot;but quite a few of my colleagues are well off.&quot;    West Germany's state pension system, which was established in 1957, is similar to America's Social Security program. Participation is mandatory (except for the self-employed), and the system is financed through matching contributions by employees and their employers.    However, the contributions are heftier in Germany, in part because the benefits are higher. The state paid out more than $100 billion last year in pension benefits, or 43% of all social-welfare spending. Only Switzerland spent a higher share of its welfare budget on pensions.    &quot;There is deeply rooted in the German mind a notion that people, in their old age, must be fully supported by the system,&quot; says Meinhard Miegel, the director of the Institute for Economic and Social Policy, a Bonn-based think tank.    But the generosity of benefits isn't the only problem. Retirees are living longer, their numbers are increasing and they are collecting pensions at a younger age. The government in 1972 lowered the age at which people may receive a full pension to 63 years from 65; the handicapped can receive full pensions at age 60.    Yet the average age of men who were granted pensions last year was 59, according to the government. That is because the law also allows for pensions if petitioners are certified by physicians as unable to work or if they have been displaced from their chosen professions. Nearly half of all pensions granted from 1980 to 1984 were for disabilities.    Often, however, the disability isn't disabling. Heinz Distler, a former machinist who lives near Stuttgart, has received about $8,000 a year from the state for the past five years to offset a back problem. But under an arrangement that is perfectly legal, he has also been working at another job he found with the help of a government employment office. Mr. Distler's state pension increased to about $14,000 a year earlier this week, following his 60th birthday.    As a solution, some advocate paying a uniform and lower pension, which could be supplemented by individuals through private insurance programs. But Mr. Miegel has seen past governments duck pension reform before. &quot;What we need is a new machine,&quot; he says. &quot;What we'll get is repair work on the old one.&quot;    Medical Insurance   At the back of the Hohn family's crowded store in downtown Bonn, the shelves bulge with artificial limbs, thermal underwear, rubber stockings and walking sticks. Medical paraphernalia is big business in Germany: The Hohns employ 21 people in their small store, and their annual revenue has grown to more than $2 million.    Insurance is largely responsible. It pays for almost everything, from incidentals such as rubber stockings and warm underwear to elaborate services such as cancer screenings and open-heart surgery. In the past decade, the annual costs of maintaining the system have almost doubled to $54 billion.    The health system is also financed by compulsory payroll deductions (although high-income earners may choose a private plan, and about 8% of the people have). Germans receive a booklet of health-insurance tickets that serve as vouchers to pay for both routine visits to doctors and dentists and major medical treatment. Apart from a small deductible -- $1 on drugs and $2 on other medical items -- they pay no cash.    There are virtually no ceilings on costs. A woman in labor, for instance, might be asked whether she wants the chief obstetrician to deliver her baby. Choosing a more experienced doctor won't cost her any more; it just costs the state more.    As the German population ages over the next decade, the already high costs will spiral. Attempts by past governments to trim medical costs have tended to work only for a short while. Sometimes, they have even backfired: When authorities introduced the $1 deductible for prescription medicines a few years ago, for example, costs actually rose because Germans asked their doctors to prescribe bigger quantities of drugs.    While Bonn sets the legal framework for the health service, it doesn't run it, making reform harder to put into practice. More than 2,000 autonomous health-insurance funds collect the contributions and pay the bills. Any attempt to change the system must be approved by the government, the insurance funds, doctors, dentists, technicians, hospital administrators and the pharmaceutical industry, among others. &quot;For 30 years, the government has tried to make a breakthrough, but it's terribly hard,&quot; says Ernst Kreuzaler, a government welfare-policy expert.    One solution being considered is a big across-the-board reduction in the services that the health-insurance funds pay for. Others divide along political lines. The left contends that doctors, dentists and hospitals should cut costs and that state involvement should be widened. The right wants big deductibles for patients and an increase in supplementary private insurance.    While reform is still some way off, Wolfgang Hohn, who owns the medical-supply store, is resigned to its impact. He has already felt the pinch from some previous cost-curbing measures. &quot;It's bound to get worse for us,&quot; he says with a sigh, &quot;because the insurers just won't have the money to spend.&quot;    ---   The Burden of Welfare Spending Vs.
