She contended that the commission's proposal ``ignores thegrowing number of health studies that indicate that low doses ofradiation increase the health risks of those exposed.''   The NRC has proposed to exempt from federal regulations low-levelwaste that would expose people to 10 millirems of radiation a year _approximately the same amount of radiation involved in a whole-mouthdental X-ray.   If finally adopted, the new rule would enable atomic power plantsand other users of nuclear materials to dispose of such low-levelradioactive waste as ordinary refuse shipped to incinerators or landfills.   Ms. D'Arrigo told an NRC staff panel at a public meeting insuburban Bethesda, Md., that ``part of the responsibility for usingradioactive materials for any purpose is keeping them from harmingor potentially harming anyone _ in this generation and in futuregenerations.''   ``Those who operate nuclear power stations and those who produceradioactive consumer products must be required to do whatever ittakes, at whatever the cost, to keep the radiation they generate outof the lives and environments of those who choose not to increasetheir risk by exposure,'' she said.   Also criticizing the proposed change was another anti-nucleargroup, the Environmental Coalition on Nuclear Power. JudithJohnsrud, speaking for the coalition, asserted that ``all exposuresto ionizing radiation may have deleterious genetic or somatic (body)effects.''   On this issue, she said, ``prudence and conservatism areessential to serve the public interest.''   Speakers endorsing the NRC proposal included Lauriston S. Taylor,representing the Health Physics Society, an organization ofphysicians and scientists involved with radiation biology andmedicine.   Taylor said that ``extremely costly protective measures'' arecurrently required by ``regulatory control of very low-levelradiation exposures that are believed to be well below the need ofregulation.''   ``If this is allowed to continue, estimates of future costs inunnecessary parts of programs of waste management and site cleanuphave been estimated to range into billions of dollars,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
