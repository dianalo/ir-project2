Bennett emerged Mondayfrom a meeting with officials from metropolitan Washington _ butnot Mayor Marion Barry _ saying he found ``good will on theirpart'' to help his plan to combat drug abuse and related violencein the area.   Barry, whose administration was attacked by Bennett a week agoas having ``failed to serve its citizens,'' did not attend themeeting because he was testifying before a Senate panel. Barryasked the Senate Appropriations Committee's District of Columbiapanel to assign 500 federal police officers to aid the drug fight.   Bennett's meeting Monday was marked by confusion among localofficials about what the plan meant, if the war on drugs would endat the District boundary line and whether they would get stuck witha new prison for Washington criminals. Bennett's office invited themayors of 11 local cities and eight counties as well as thegovernors of Maryland and Virginia.   The mayors and county officials who attended the hourlongmeeting told reporters afterward they were pleased their areaswould be included for intelligence gathering and law enforcementefforts by a new task force, but Baltimore Mayor Curt Schmoke said,``There were still many more questions than answers today....   ``What I got from my understanding today was that this plan isevolving, that this is just the first phase, and that's why we'restill in a situation where there are still a lot of questions onour minds,'' Schmoke said.   Bennett's criticism of and estrangement from Barry has broughtup questions about whether they can work together to combat thedrug problem that has made Washington the nation's murder capital.   Bennett said Monday that he had not spoken directly with Barrysince the plan for Washington was announced a week earlier, butsaid he had invited the mayor to attend the meeting and he urgedreporters to drop the issue.   ``We are not in the process of developing a relationship; we aretrying to respond to the drug problem,'' Bennett said. ``This issueabout whether Marion Barry and I will stand up in public and putour arms around each other is not the issue, and you ought to getoff it.''   Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who met with Bennett laterin the day, said, ``The issue is not Barry vs. Bennett. It isdrug-pushing terrorists against a civilized society. My sense isthat Barry is not feuding with Mr. Bennett. Mr. Bennett certainlyis not feuding with Mr. Barry.''   On Sunday, Jackson had toured Washington and played somebasketball with Barry and had criticized Bennett's plan forWashington, saying it was too limited in scope. But there was nopublic criticism of Bennett on Monday.   Bennett selected Washington as a ``test case'' for the drug warand has said he plans to use what he learns from the variousapproaches tried here to help him compile the national drug controlstrategy, which is due in another 4{ months.   Washington became the nation's murder capital last year with 372murders, most of them drug-related. So far this year, there havebeen 145 slayings, compared with 96 at the same time in 1988.   Bennett's plan, among other things, called for creation of ametropolitan area task force of law enforcement agents with of 57more federal officials, construction of the pretrial detentionfacility and a 700-bed federal prison.   Among the questions still open was the location of a 500-bedpretrial detention facility. Bennett praised the officials whoattended the meeting Monday for their understanding that ``withpositions of responsibility come responsibilities to act on certainthings.'' But he criticized the ``not-in-my-back-yard'' attitudemany people have about prisons.   ``Everybody wants to wage the war on drugs, but there are fewervolunteers for the building of prisons,'' Bennett said. ``We maynot want prisons in our county or in our part of the state, but insome areas the choice may be between having the bad guys in theback yard or the prison in the back yard.''   Bennett said the purpose of Monday's meeting ``was to inform thegood, local, responsible officials of a little more detail'' on theplan. ``I want to stress the degree of good will on their part,they are interested, they're on board, they want to see thisproblem solved.''</TEXT></DOC>
