Availabilitywas used as the measure of reliability in this study. The variation ofavailability with the following seven characteristics was analyzed: enginespeed, maintenance contract type, absorption chiller type, turbochargertype, operation mode, emissions controls and engine type. Availabilityvariations by time in service were also calculated. In addition the datawas analyzed to assess the causes of unscheduled outages. System shutdownstatistics were gathered that attributed failure to one or more of 15different subsystems. Data was also gathered on the electric and thermalefficiencies of the cogeneration system, system installed costs, maintenancecosts, savings, payback periods, and ownership. Again the variation inthese data with the six parameters listed above were analyzed. All ofthe data were entered into a database using the dBase III software andan IBM PC. 27 ref., 16 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
