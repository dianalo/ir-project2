Introduction</ITAG>Section 1427 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), 42 U.S.C. 300h-6, establishesa program to demonstrate techniques for protecting Critical Aquifer ProtectionAreas (CAPA) within sole or principal source aquifers (SSA) and authorizesgrant funds through a grant application procedure for this purpose.SDWA section 1427 also requires that demonstration projects must meet certaincriteria to be eligible for funding. EPA promulgated regulations in 1987establishing such criteria pursuant to section 1427(d). Today's rulemakingaction amends those regulations based on public comments received in responseto the publication of the rules in 1987.A. Legal BackgroundTo be eligible for a grant under SDWA section 1427, the statute requiresthat a demonstration program must be located in a CAPA of a sole or principalsource aquifer. The term, sole or principal source aquifer, means an aquiferwhich the Agency has determined under SDWA section 1424(e) ``is the soleor principal drinking water source for [an] area and which, if contaminated,would create a significant hazard to public health.'' In February 1987,the Agency issued a document entitled the ``Sole Source Aquifer DesignationPetitioners Guidance'' which describes the procedures and criteria thatEPA will use in determining whether to designate an aquifer as a sole orprincipal source aquifer.Section 1427(b) of the SDWA defines the term Critical Aquifer ProtectionArea to mean either of the following:<ITAG tagnum="21"> (1) All or part of an area located within an area for which an applicationor designation as a sole or principal source aquifer pursuant to section1424(e), has been submitted and approved by the Administrator not laterthan 24 months after June 19, 1986, and which satisfies the criteria establishedby the Administrator under subsection (d) of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) All or part of an area which is within an aquifer designated asa sole source aquifer as of June 19, 1986, and for which an areawide ground-waterquality protection plan has been approved under section 208 of the CleanWater Act prior to June 19, 1986.</ITAG>Section 1427(d) states that not later than June 19, 1987, the Administratorshall, by rule, establish criteria for identifying CAPAs. Such criteriawould be used in identifying CAPAs under section 1427(b)(1). Section 1427(d)further provides that in establishing such criteria, the Administratorshall consider each of the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The vulnerability of the aquifer to contamination due to hydrogeologiccharacteristics.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The number of persons or the proportion of population using theground water as a drinking water source.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The economic, social and environmental benefits that would resultto the area from maintenance of ground water of high quality.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) The economic, social and environmental costs that would resultfrom degradation of the quality of the ground water.</ITAG>The Agency has determined that this regulation is not subject to the noticeand comment rulemaking requirements of section 553 of the AdministrativeProcedure Act (APA). In enacting SDWA section 1427 Congress did not intendto establish a Federal regulatory program. Rather, the legislative historydemonstrates that Congress intended to authorize EPA to provide grant fundingfor demonstration programs to protect CAPAs. As stated by Senator Durenbergerin consideration of the Conference Report of the 1986 Safe Drinking WaterAct amendments, the Sole Source Aquifer Demonstration Program is ``[a]grant program. It authorizes assistance to State and local governmentsto plan and implement programs that will protect sole source aquifers.''132 CONG. REC. S6289 (Daily ed. May 21, 1986) Accordingly, since the purposefor determining whether an area is a critical aquifer protection area isto establish eligibility for the awarding of sole source aquifer demonstrationgrants, this regulation falls within the scope of APA section 553(a)(2).That provision exempts rules from notice and comment requirements ``tothe extent there is involved * * * a matter relating to * * * public property,loans, grants, benefits or contracts.'' Further, there are no independentprocedural requirements contained in SDWA section 1427 which would supersedethe section 553(a)(2) grants exemption and require the Agency to go throughnotice and comment rulemaking. Finally, the Agency notes that it has, ineffect, conducted notice and comment rulemaking by issuing this final regulationafter taking public comment on the June 26, l987, interim final rule. B. Procedural Background On June 26, 1987, EPA issued an interim final rule which established criteriafor determining whether to designate an area as a CAPA under SDWA section1427. 52 FR 23982 (Codified at 40 CFR 149.1-.3 and referred to hereafteras the 1987 CAPA rule.) Although the Agency's 1987 CAPA rule was finaland became effective immediately upon publication, the Agency solicitedpublic comments. During the 90-day comment period, the Agency receivedcomments from 11 groups, including four environmental organizations, twoprofessional societies, and two companies. In addition, on August 10, 1987, the Natural Resources Defense Council,Inc., the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Environmental Policy Institutefiled a petition for review of the 1987 CAPA rule in the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the Second Circuit, <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., et.al. </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>No. 87-4100. The petitioners identified three issues forjudicial review: (1) Whether issuance of the CAPA rule as an ``interimfinal'' rule violated the procedural requirements of the APA and SDWA;(2) whether consideration of the cost of replacement of a drinking watersupply was appropriate under the SDWA in making CAPA determinations; and(3) whether EPA established an appropriate formula of assessing the percentageof a population dependent on the CAPA as a source of drinking water. Theseissues were identical to concerns expressed by the petitioners in theircomments on the rule. By stipulation dated September 9, 1987, the partiesagreed to withdrawal of the petition for review. The Agency has re-examined the positions taken in the 1987 CAPA rule inlight of the public comments. For reasons explained in section II of thispreamble, EPA has decided to make certain changes in the criteria for determiningwhether to designate an area as a CAPA and is amending its regulationsaccordingly. The Agency, however, does not agree with all of the commentsit received and has declined to make certain suggested modifications. Thereasons for the Agency's positions are discussed more fully in sectionIII of the preamble. Section IV of the preamble discusses EPA's plans forimplementing the grant program when funds are made available for demonstrationprojects. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of the 1987 CAPA Rule and Explanation of Modificationsmade in the 1989 Rule </ITAG>A. Summary of the 1987 CAPA Rule The 1987 CAPA rule describes a CAPA to be, in general, a major vulnerablerecharge area to a sole or principal source aquifer (SSA) of particularlyhigh value. The 1987 rule also established a set of minimum criteria foridentifying a CAPA which required that the proposed aquifer or segmentof an aquifer be more valuable and more vulnerable to contamination thanis required for SSA designation. The l987 rule established the followingrequirements for CAPA designation:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The sole source aquifer is particularly vulnerable to contaminationdue to the hydrogeologic characteristics of the unsaturated or saturatedzone; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The sole source aquifer is the source of drinking water for atleast 75% of the persons in the aquifer service area; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The cost of replacing the water supply from the sole source aquiferwould cause water supply cost to exceed 0.7 percent of mean annual householdincome.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">See 40 CFR 149.3(a) (1)-(3) (1987).</ITAG>In addition, the 1987 CAPA rule provided for consideration of ``evidencethat ground water in the suggested CAPA discharges into an area containingvaluable ecological systems, ecological areas protected by Federal or Statelaws, which are dependent on ground water, or that there would be significantenvironmental or social costs, or health risks, if the area were contaminated* * *.'' This evidence, however, would not be sufficient to support a CAPAdetermination by itself. See <T3>id. </T3>The preamble to the 1987 rule contained descriptions of areas which EPAwould generally consider to be vulnerable to contamination. See 52 FR 23984(June 26, 1987). The preamble also described the kinds of information suchas maps and hydrogeologic data (See id. at 23985), that would be usefulfor assisting EPA in the evaluation of the application. This preamble discussioncontinues to be valid for the purposes of the 1989 rule. Finally, the 1987 CAPA rule codified the provision of SDWA section 1427(b)(2).Under this provision of the statute, EPA must automatically determine thatan area is a CAPA if the applicant can show that the proposed area is allor part of an area designated as a sole or principal source aquifer pursuantto section 1424(e) by June 19, 1986, and that an areawide ground-waterquality protection plan was approved for the area under section 208 ofthe Clean Water Act by that date. B. Modifications to the 1987 CAPA Rule EPA has made four significant changes in the CAPA rule being promulgatedtoday: (1) EPA deleted the requirement that 75% of the persons in the aquiferservice area be supplied with drinking water from the sole source aquifer.(2) EPA deleted the requirement that the cost of replacing the water supplyfrom the sole source aquifer would cause water supply costs to exceed 0.7percent of mean annual household income. (3) EPA revised the rule to allow for the consideration of social and environmentalcosts, as well as economic costs, in the assessment of the cost of contaminationof an SSA. The Agency's major emphasis, however, will remain on the protectionof drinking water sources; and (4) EPA incorporated into the rule a consideration of the likelihood ofcontamination of the proposed CAPA. The reasons for these changes are set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Population Requirement </ITAG>The purpose of the 75% criterion was to limit CAPAs only to those aquifersfor which a substantial portion of the population was dependent upon groundwater. It also was another tool in deciding which CAPAs are potentiallymore valuable. The Agency has subsequently analyzed data on populationsserved by SSAs and has found that most of the SSAs serve 100% of the populationin the aquifer service area. In fact, this 75% criterion would have excludedonly three of the current SSAs from eligibility for CAPA designation. TheAgency therefore believes, for the purposes of this rule, this criterionneed not be more stringent than that required for sole source aquifer designation(i.e., the aquifer must serve at least 50% of the population). Althoughthe practical result of this change is to enlarge the number of areas potentiallyeligible for CAPA grants, we note that a proposed CAPA must still constitutepart of or all of an SSA. Since the SSA criteria require that an aquiferserve at least 50% of the population in the aquifer service area, the changedoes not eliminate entirely the consideration of the extent of dependenceon the aquifer as a source of drinking water. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Economic Replaceability </ITAG>The purpose of the specific income test, which required that the cost ofreplacing the water supplies from the sole source aquifer exceed 0.7 percentof mean annual household income, was to exclude areas from being CAPAsif the local population had the ability easily to pay for an alternativesource of drinking water in the event the aquifer should become contaminated.The greater the expense of replacing the drinking water provided by theaquifer, the higher the value for a demonstration project. The 0.7 thresholdwas chosen to represent a slightly higher figure than what might be consideredto be representative of the average (i.e., 0.4 to 0.6 percent of mean annualhousehold income) paid for water in the U.S. The Agency intended to usethis slightly more restrictive figure as another means of identifying potentialCAPAs as a special subset of SSAs.The Agency studied more recent data compiled on household costs and futurereplacement costs compiled as a part of Regulatory Impact Analyses beingperformed for ongoing rulemaking activities related to the Safe DrinkingWater Act Amendments of l986. These data indicate that water supply costswill increase in the future as the result of additional regulatory requirementsand that the future costs of water supply are likely to exceed 0.7 percentof mean annual household income in many public water systems. Because the0.7 percent threshold may not identify areas that are particularly valuableunder such new criteria, the Agency is dropping the specific 0.7 percentthreshold in the revised final rule. In its place, EPA is including a criterionthat the costs resulting from foreseeable contamination would be ``significant.''By using the term ``significant,'' EPA intends to allow itself some discretionin deciding which areas should be designated as CAPAs. EPA expects to considera variety of ways of evaluating the significance of replacement costs,such as the increase in the absolute cost of supplying drinking water ifwater were obtained from a replacement source, the cost of replacementwater relative to the cost of supplying water elsewhere in the region,and the increased cost expressed as a percentage of mean annual householdincome. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Consideration of Economic, Social and Environmental Costs </ITAG>The Agency has also revised the way in which it considers economic, social,and environmental costs. Rather than treat environmental and social costsas a factor that is considered only when the replaceability cost criterionis inconclusive, EPA has decided to review all potential types of costsresulting from contamination of a proposed CAPA. This analysis may includeconsideration of health risks and social costs related to contaminationincidents. This change is being made to recognize the multiple uses ofground water and thus the possibility that contamination may have importantimpacts without affecting a drinking water supply significantly. Moreover,the statute implies in SDWA section 1427(d) that EPA should consider eachof the different kinds of costs that may result from contamination. Thus, EPA will determine whether, taken together, the economic, environmental,and social costs resulting from foreseeable contamination are significant.In making this judgment, EPA will continue to place its primary emphasison the protection of valuable drinking water supplies. Consistent withthis emphasis, the Agency anticipates that only in very unusual situationswill the environmental or social costs of contamination be sufficientlygreat, by themselves, to support determination that an area is a CAPA.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Likelihood of Contamination </ITAG>Finally, EPA has clarified in the revised CAPA rule that only those coststhat are reasonably foreseeable will be considered in determining whetheran area is a CAPA. This rule was revised to make clear the Agency's intentionto limit eligibility for CAPA designation and eventual grants to areaswhich face some realistic threat of contamination. In addition to beingresponsive to a public comment, this revision is a logical outgrowth ofusing the CAPA determination as an eligibility criterion for a demonstrationgrant. Obviously, a demonstration program is most useful when it addressesa real, immediate contamination threat; conversely, the effectiveness ofa ground-water protection project which is designed to prevent contaminationby a source that does not exist will be open to question, since the adequacyof the control measures in the protection program will not have been tested.Therefore, the Agency wishes to stress that extremely improbable threatswill not be sufficient to justify CAPA designation. For example, if thearea were located in a rural setting tens of miles from the nearest populationcenters, the Agency might agree that contamination of relatively cleanground water by urban hazardous waste might cause significant economic,social or environmental costs. Nevertheless, the likelihood of such contaminationwould be quite low, and probably would not be considered as a reasonableground for determining that the area is a CAPA. <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Public Comments on the 1987 CAPA Rule and EPA's Responses </ITAG>A.Introduction This section of the preamble will describe in detail the public commentsthat the Agency received on the 1987 CAPA rule during the comment periodfrom June 26, 1987, through September 24, 1987. Also included in this sectionare EPA's responses to the comments. EPA received 12 sets of comments. Although most comments suggested changesand deletions to the 1987 CAPA rule, several comments supported the rule.Commenters particularly expressed support for the 75% population thresholdand the discussion contained in the preamble of different hydrogeologicalconditions which are vulnerable and therefore conducive to leaching. B. Criteria for CAPA Designation <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that EPA establish an additionalcriterion for CAPA designation which considered whether the water sourcesthat would be used for replacing an existing ground-water supply are affectedby droughts.<T3>EPA Response: </T3>The Agency believes that the criteria in both the1987 CAPA rule and this rule are adequate to address this concern. Thepreamble to the 1987 rule explains the criteria that the Agency considersfor evaluating the adequacy of alternative water sources. See 52 FR 23985.As implied in the preamble, EPA expects that alternative sources must beat least as reliable as the original source. Therefore an applicant fora grant under the Safe Drinking Water Act section 1427 may exclude fromconsideration as a possible source of replacement water any source whichis known to be significantly less reliable than the original source ofsupply. <T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter said that coordination of ``controls'' overCAPA areas may be difficult because of overlapping jurisdictions. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA agrees that a particular CAPA may be geographicallydefined in a way that crosses political boundaries (e.g., city limits,county lines) and that there may be greater difficulty in coordinatinga program to protect ground water than if the CAPA lay entirely withina single jurisdiction. The statute, however, indicates that an application for a CAPA demonstrationgrant must be submitted by a governmental entity or group of entities whichhave the legal authority to implement a proposed protection plan in a CAPA.See SDWA sections 1427 (c) and (f)(1)(E). Thus, before EPA approves anygrants for CAPA demonstration programs, the Agency will require the applicantor applicants to have the necessary legal authority and jurisdiction forcoordinating activities to make the program effective. In some cases, itmay be necessary that two or more governmental entities join in one application.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter, who apparently believed that EPA had (orwould establish) a fixed limit on the size of a CAPA, objected to sucha position because it failed to recognize the impact of hydrogeologic factorson the extent of ground-water contamination. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA does not have a policy on the maximum size ofa CAPA. EPA agrees that establishing a fixed limit on the size of a CAPAwould be inappropriate because of the variability of hydrogeologic conditionsthat can affect the nature of ground-water contamination. EPA expects thatsome CAPAs could be small and others could be quite large, perhaps as bigas the SSA itself. Under both the 1987 and 1989 rules, the size of theCAPA will be determined by hydrogeologic characteristics relating to therecharge characteristics of the particular area. Therefore, EPA will notspecify any particular type or amount of data necessary to demonstratethat an area is hydrogeologically vulnerable or to define the boundariesof a recharge area. Once EPA establishes its grants application procedures,EPA will judge these matters on a case-by-case basis in the review of applications.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned the definition of an aquiferand particularly the minimum yield criteria. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>Section 149.2 of the 1987 CAPA rule defined an aquiferas a geologic formation, group of formations or part of a formation thatis capable of yielding a significant amount of water to a well or spring.The SSA Designation Guidance used the same terminology to define an aquiferand offered guidance on how EPA would interpret the phrase ``yielding asignificant amount of water.'' Specifically, the SSA Designation Guidanceindicated that EPA would consider a yield of 150 gal/day as enough to satisfythe yield criterion for SSA designation. This commenter also suggestedthat the Agency should set a minimum production level for water-bearingzones to qualify as an aquifer and recommended a sustainable yield of agallon per minute over a year. The SDWA requires that an area proposed for a CAPA designation must beall or part of an SSA. In other words, before the Agency is ever calledupon to determine whether an area satisfies the criteria for a designation,EPA will have decided that the geological formation involved has sufficientyield to be an SSA. Therefore, the CAPA grant program does not raise theissue of how sufficient yield is evaluated, and the comment is, strictlyspeaking, irrelevant to the 1987 CAPA rule. Nonetheless, EPA has consideredthe commenter's suggestion to replace the 150 gal/day with sustainableyield of a gal/min over a year guideline and concludes that it would beinappropriate. A yield of 1 gal/min is equivalent to a yield of 1,440 gal/day,almost ten times the value in EPA's SSA Designation Guidance. EPA believesthat an aquifer which yields 150 gal/day_enough to satisfy the averagedaily needs of a family of three, would satisfy the yield requirements,and be eligible for designation under the SSA program, if other criteriaare met. There is no compelling reason to exclude such low yield aquifersfrom grants under SDWA section 1427. <T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter questioned EPA's explanation of the relationshipbetween an SSA and CAPA designation. Specifically, the commenter referredto EPA's explanation in the preamble that ``the CAPA criteria would generallyrequire that the sole source aquifer in question be more valuable and vulnerablethat is minimally required for SSA designation.'' See 52 FR 23983. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA meant that to be designated as a CAPA an areamust meet stricter criteria than those needed to receive SSA status. Asa result, CAPAs would consist of areas that are a subset of SSAs.In the 1989 CAPA rule, the Agency has made the criteria for CAPA determinationmore flexible; EPA believes, nonetheless, that CAPAs should still constitutea special subset of SSAs, and emphasizes that CAPAs will be the areas thatare most vulnerable and most susceptible to contamination as well as beingmost ``useful'' for a demonstration. C. Vulnerability To Contamination <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters requested clarification of some terminologyin the preamble to the 1987 CAPA rule referring to the vulnerability ofaquifers. Specifically, the commenters asked EPA to explain the phrases_``particularlyvaluable,'' ``particularly vulnerable to contamination,'' and ``highlypermeable unsaturated soils.'' See 52 FR 23984. The commenters suggestedusing standard geologic definitions with acceptable/unacceptable rangesof permeability. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>These comments are directed to the preamble of therule and not the rule itself. EPA intended that the wording of the ruleand the preamble allow the Agency flexibility in determining whether anarea is vulnerable, without giving specific numbers to adhere to. Thisapproach is based on the suggestions of a technical workgroup which wasestablished during the interim final rulemaking process. The group, whichalso provided suggestions on the wellhead protection program, consistedof representatives from EPA's Headquarters and Regional offices, the U.S.Geological Survey, and five State geological and environmental protectionorganizations. Members of the group had expertise in both technical andprogrammatic aspects of hydrogeology and ground-water protection. The groupwas asked to evaluate whether specific values should be placed on vulnerability.The group suggested that for the purposes of this rule, specific numbersneed not be placed on parameters, in recognition of both the wide rangein hydrogeologic factors affecting the vulnerability of sole source aquifers,as well as the wide range in possible contamination threats to be addressedby a Comprehensive Management Plan. The Agency accepted these suggestions.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter said that consideration of vulnerabilityshould also include discussion of land use factors and development pressure.As an example, the commenter pointed out that an industrial park wouldbe more likely to cause contamination of an aquifer than a national orState park. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA generally agrees with the commenter. As explainedin Section II of this preamble, the Agency has revised the 1987 CAPA ruleto require consideration of the likelihood of contamination of a proposedCAPA. Thus, an applicant will be expected to demonstrate that contaminationof an aquifer is a foreseeable possibility and to explain how such contaminationwould result in economic, environmental and social costs. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern about how the presenceof a limited area, characterized by soil of high permeability, within alarger, generally less vulnerable area might affect EPA's decision to designatethe larger area as a CAPA. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>The commenter was apparently concerned that EPAwould base its evaluation of vulnerability of a proposed CAPA on the permeabilityof the most vulnerable part of the proposed CAPA. EPA recognized that thereare wide variations in hydrogeological characteristics within a small geographicalarea. As a result, some portions of a proposed CAPA may be significantlymore vulnerable to contamination than other parts. Although the Agencyis interested in the degree of variability, it does not see the benefitfrom specifying exact relative ratios of ``more vulnerable'' to ``lessvulnerable'' areas, because the Agency is interested in the overall vulnerabilityof the proposed CAPA. If a proposed CAPA includes some areas that are nothighly vulnerable, the Agency may decide to exclude those areas from aCAPA designation. D. Population Served <T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters found the terminology that was usedin referring to population served, specifically, the words ``population,''``persons,'' and ``aquifer service area,'' to be confusing. See 52 FR 23986.These commenters requested clarification of these terms because of theirconcern that a particular recharge area, which would otherwise qualifyfor CAPA designation, might not qualify because that area failed to meetthe population criterion. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>As a point of clarification, it should be notedthat the population dependence criterion (50% in this rule or 75% in the1987 rule) refers to the population dependency of the SSA itself ratherthan to population dependence within a CAPA or subset of CAPA. The terms``persons'' and ``aquifer service area'' are defined and explained in theSSA Designation Guidance. The ``population criterion'' in the 1987 rulereferred to the proportion of ``persons'' dependent on ground water withinboth the ``aquifer service area'' and the area above the SSA itself. Theterm ``person'' is defined in the SSA Designation Guidance as: individual,corporation, company, association, partnership, State, municipality orFederal Agency (and includes officers, employees, and agents of any corporation,company, association, State, municipality, or Federal Agency). The term``aquifer service area'' is also defined in the SSA Designation Guidanceas the area above the aquifer and including the area where the entire populationserved by the aquifer lives. The population criterion is not applied withinthe CAPA or a component of the CAPA such as a part of the recharge area,but rather to the entire aquifer service area and area above the SSA. Furtherinformation on performing these calculations appears in the SSA DesignationGuidance. It should be noted, however, that the 75% population criterionhas been deleted from this rule.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters said that there is no statutory basisfor requiring that a CAPA serve 75% of the population. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>As explained earlier, EPA has deleted the 75% criterionin the final rule. EPA, however, disagrees with the contention that itdoes not have statutory authority to establish such a criterion, sincesection 1427(d) of the SDWA specifically directs the Administrator to consider``the proportion of population using the ground water (aquifer) as a drinkingwater source.'' <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters said that the determination of ``populationserved'' needs to incorporate projected population growth. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>Since EPA has eliminated the 75% population criterionin the final rule, future population growth would become relevant underthe CAPA rule only in the following ways: (a) Whether future populationgrowth would increase the threat of contamination to the SSA and (b) whetherexisting threats to the SSA would possibly affect future growth. In eithercase, the applicant for a demonstration grant has the responsibility ofproviding information which is sufficient to support predicted changesin future population levels and to show how such changes are related tothe threat of contamination. A variety of types of information could satisfythe applicable criteria. For example, an applicant could show that a publicrail system is scheduled to open a new station and that new housing developmentplans have been filed and will likely be approved. If the aquifer wereto become contaminated due to proposed septic tank fields, the resultingimpacts could cause significant economic and social costs to the existingand future residents. E. Economic Replaceability <T3>Comment: </T3>Four commenters objected strongly to the economic replaceabilitycriterion in the 1987 CAPA rule, arguing both that there was not statutorybasis for the criterion and that it was inconsistent with the statutorypurpose. Specifically, one commenter argued that SDWA section 1427(d) listedthe only criteria which EPA could consider in deciding whether an areawas a CAPA and that the cost of replacing a drinking water supply couldnot be used as a criterion because it was not listed in the statute. Othercommenters made similar arguments and also claimed that the use of thereplacement cost criterion conflicted with the basic purpose of SDWA section1427, which they described as ``protecting vulnerable ground water againstcontamination'' and ``prevent[ing] degradation'' of ``high quality groundwater.'' <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA is deleting the requirement in the 1987 CAPArule that replacement costs must exceed 0.7% of mean annual household income.EPA will consider whether the cost of replacing a contaminated drinkingwater supply, together with other economic, environmental, and social costs,would be significant. See 40 CFR 149.3(a)(3). EPA believes that both thereplacement cost criterion in the 1987 CAPA rule and the revised criterionare consistent with the statute. The statute provides that, in establishingcriteria for identifying CAPAs, the Administrator shall consider ``theeconomic costs * * * that would result from degradation of the qualityof the drinking water.'' See SDWA section 1427(d)(4). The cost of supplyingalternate water is clearly a possible economic cost that could result fromcontamination of an SSA. Obviously, there would be little or no point inconsidering various costs unless the Agency distinguished between areasproposed as CAPAs based on the magnitude of such costs. Thus, it is consistentwith the statute for the Agency to establish a criterion which identifiesan area as a CAPA only if contamination would cause ``significant'' costs.EPA thinks that the replacement cost criterion in the 1987 CAPA rule wassimilarly consistent with the statutory scheme. EPA disagrees with the commenter who argued that the replacement cost criterionwas illegal because it was not listed in SDWA section 1427(d). Even ifit were not, the Agency is not limited to the four factors listed in SDWAsection 1427(d) in establishing criteria for identifying CAPAs. SDWA section1427(d) provides in part that ``[i]n establishing * * * criteria (for identifyingCAPAs), the Administrator shall consider each of the following'' factors.The statute does not restrict the Administrator to consideration of thesefactors alone, nor does it prohibit consideration of other factors. Moreover,the statute only requires the Administrator to ``consider'' these factors,but it does not mandate their use in establishing the CAPA criteria. Thus,the Agency believes that SDWA section 1427(d) gives EPA authority to establishand use any additional reasonable criteria in determining which areas areCAPAs. Finally, EPA disagrees with the commenter's characterization of the purposeof SDWA section 1427, and rejects the view that the criteria are inappropriatein light of the statutory purpose. As noted in section IIB, the only purposeof determining that an area is a CAPA is to establish eligibility for agrant program. The grant program is for the purpose of demonstrating howto protect human health, the environment, and ground-water resources. SeeSDWA section 1427 (a) and (f)(1). As demonstration projects, the activitiesfunded under SDWA section 1427 are merely examples of programs that couldbe implemented elsewhere in the country. Indeed, by setting a ceiling onthe funds that may be spent annually on an aquifer or under the entireprogram, the statute makes clear that the grants program is limited inscope. See SDWA section 1427 (j) and (k). In short, it is clear from thestatute that Congress did not intend to create a comprehensive grant programto fund protection projects at each SSA. Rather, Congress' goal was moremodest_to encourage the development of measures that effectively protectvulnerable SSAs and to promote their application in other areas. See SDWAsection 1427(l).The criteria in today's rule, like the criteria in the 1987 CAPA rule,are fully consistent with the statutory purpose. The criteria aid EPA inidentifying the areas which should be CAPAs and should, therefore, be eligiblefor one of a limited number of demonstration grants. It is entirely appropriatetherefore that the criteria operate selectively, leading to the identificationof a special subset of SSAs as CAPAs in which demonstration programs willbe carried out most productively. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that, in some cases, the distanceto alternative water sources is so great that economic infeasibility isobvious without further analysis. The commenter requested that the Agencyshould specify a maximum distance beyond which consideration of alternativeswould not be required. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA is changing the economic cost criterion in therule so that the applicants are free to provide any evidence that shows``significant'' economic damages that would result from contamination ofthe aquifer. Unusually long distance to alternative sources of water supply(i.e., via pipelines) could be used as evidence of irreplaceability. EPAdoes not want to restrict the allowable analysis by specifying particularmaximum distances on a national level because a fixed distance number wouldnot apply uniformly nationwide (e.g., a pipeline distance of ten milesin certain Eastern States might be considered unreasonable, whereas thesame distance might be considered reasonable for pipelines in certain WesternStates.) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected that the 1987 CAPA rule failedto specify any level for the quality of the water used to replace drinkingwater from a contaminated SSA. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA has decided not to revise the rule to specifya certain quality for the replacement of the water. EPA intends, at a minimum,that replacement water be potable at the time of delivery to the consumerand that this water meet all applicable water quality requirements underthe Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA recognizes that contamination of an SSA could force users to rely ona potable replacement source which may be of lower quality than water fromthe SSA. In such a situation, the loss of quality would represent environmental,social or economic cost resulting from the contamination. Such a potentialloss would be considered by EPA in deciding whether costs of contaminationare sufficiently ``significant'' that the area should be determined tobe a CAPA. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the economic replaceabilitytest because it could fail to adequately recognize economic impacts onpopulations supplied by regional ground-water systems. In such systems,the costs of replacing water are distributed among a large number of usersand thus replacement costs would be less likely to exceed the 0.7% thresholdthan in smaller supply systems. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>The commenter's concern is addressed in the 1989rule with the deletion of the 0.7% criterion. The new language in the finalrule requires that replacement costs be ``significant.'' Evaluation ofwhether the cost would be considered significant would take such localfactors into account. In such situations EPA would be willing to considerother ways of evaluating the cost, such as the absolute cost of replacingthe water supply. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter said the economic replaceability criterionmay not always be an appropriate test of value, particularly if the CAPAcomprises the entire SSA. Provisions should be made for a more flexiblecost test in this regard. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA agrees that, for the purpose of the CAPA rule,the test should be made more flexible and as mentioned in earlier responsesto comments, the Agency will be deleting the 0.7% criterion and will beallowing for a more flexible test in the language in this final rule. F. Ecological and Social Value <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that the rule be revised sothat ecological and social values should be weighed on an equal basis witheconomic costs. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>As explained earlier, EPA has revised the 1987 CAPArule to provide greater flexibility by consideration of not only economicreplacement costs but also other economic costs and environmental and socialcosts of reasonably foreseeable contamination in every application fora demonstration grant (see Section II of this preamble). EPA intends tobe most concerned with the protection of aquifers as sources of drinkingwater, the primary goal of the Safe Drinking Water Act.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter said an SSA of unusual ecological or socialvalue should be eligible for designation as a CAPA, even if other criteriaare not met. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>In light of the revisions made to the 1987 CAPArule, EPA will consider all potential types of costs that could resultfrom contamination: economic, environmental and social costs. EPA agreesthat, in the absence of any economic impacts, if contamination would causean unusual or particularly severe social or environmental cost CAPA designationmay be justified. For instance, a CAPA could be designated based in parton a showing that (1) ground water recharged in the CAPA discharges toa national park or wetland, or the habitat of an endangered species, (2)there are demonstrable contamination threats, and (3) if such contaminationwere to result, a vital natural resource or species could be destroyed.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that the criteria for determiningthat an area is a CAPA should include consideration of impacts that theCAPA determination may have on farmers. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA does not accept the recommendation. The commenterapparently is concerned that a CAPA designation might impede farming activitiesor affect property owners engaged in productive enterprise on land designatedas a CAPA. EPA believes that a CAPA determination, by itself, would have no impacton farmers. A protection program carried out under a CAPA grant might affectfarmers either by limiting allowable land use or by providing increasedprotection of their ground water or both. Until EPA receives applicationsfor such grants, it is impossible to predict whether any protection programswould affect farmers adversely. At this time it does not seem appropriateto consider possible future effects of a program on farmers in decidingwhether an area is a CAPA. G. Information Requests <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter said hydrogeologic assessment informationin addition to that suggested may benefit the CAPA review process. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA agrees with this comment, and an applicant maychoose to submit any additional hydrogeologic data that will enhance theunderstanding of the vulnerability and recharge characteristics of theproposed CAPA. <T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter said clarification is needed regarding theidentification of potential pollution sources; specifically, with respectto the ability of the soils and the unsaturated zone to moderate contaminationfrom potential pollution sources and whether landowners, competent agriculturalspecialists and soil scientists would have input into such analysis. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA does not expect submission of data regardingpotential pollution sources, except as necessary for assessing the likelihoodof contamination. Regarding the hydrogeologic criteria, an applicant isfree to submit any data that could enhance the Agency's understanding ofthe vulnerability and recharge characteristics of the proposed CAPA. EPAencourages competent scientific data to be made a part of an applicationand that this information come from appropriate specialists. H. Procedural Requirements <T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters said that EPA's view that the CAPA criteriaare interim final rules and exempted from the requirements of the APA becausethey are ``grant related'' is wrong. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA disagrees with commenters who argued that EPAshould have gone through the APA notice and comment rulemaking when itissued its June 26, 1987 interim final rule. As explained earlier, Congressenacted SDWA section 1427 to establish a Sole Source Aquifer DemonstrationGrant Program. Therefore, the purpose of determining whether an area isa critical aquifer protection area is to establish eligibility for awardingdemonstration grants. Accordingly, EPA believes that the June 26, 1987interim final rule falls within the scope of the grants exception to APAnotice and comment rulemaking found in APA section 553(a)(2). Additionally,although SDWA section 1427(d) directs the Agency to establish criteriafor identifying CAPAs by rule, it contains no independent requirement fornotice and comment rulemaking in establishing such criteria. I. Definition of ``Major Recharge Area'' <T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter suggested a revision to the definition of``recharge area'' in 40 CFR 149.2; specifically, to change the second ``the''to ``a'' in the sentence explaining what constitutes a major recharge area.<T3>EPA Response: </T3>The definition presented in the 1987 CAPA rule describesa major recharge area as ``the area where the major part of the rechargeto an aquifer occurs through infiltration of precipitation or surface water.''EPA agrees that the change recommended by the commenter is technicallyvalid and has made the suggested correction in the 1989 final rule. Thereason for this change is to recognize that an SSA may contain more thanone distinct area through which a significant share of the recharge movesinto the sole source aquifer. J. Background <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter said that in order to encourage local governmentparticipation, the CAPA program needs to have minimal red tape and informationalrequirements. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA agrees that unnecessary information requirementsshould be avoided. If and when funding becomes available, EPA plans toissue guidance on how to prepare applications. The Agency will attemptto provide clear and simple instructions, concentrating on the items necessaryfor a complete application. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter said to stimulate CAPA program effectivenessand to benefit as many jurisdictions as possible, grants should be providedto fund a wide variety of aquifer protection management techniques. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA believes this comment has merit and will addressthis issue when the Agency issues grants guidance. The comment, however,does not require any revision in the 1987 CAPA rule. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked to equate the CAPA criteria to suchconcepts as ground-water classification, zones of contribution and sensitiveareas. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA believes that they are related but different.EPA believes that the statute is clear in the definition and purpose ofa CAPA. Such definition and purpose do not necessarily replace, equate,or overlap with definitions and purposes of the other ground-water protectionterms mentioned by the commenter. Some wellhead protection programs ofthe States, including those developed pursuant to section 1428 of the SDWA,do include portions of ``zones of contribution.'' The designation of specificclasses of ground water by the States often considers hydrogeologic andwater use concepts quite different than those of either CAPAs or wellheadprotection areas. State classification systems may consider different ground-waterquality and other beneficial use characteristics. EPA emphasizes however,that an applicant is free to submit information on such relationships betweenthese ground-water protection concepts and demonstrate how these conceptswould support the technical information in a demonstration application.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter said that the role of the State in theCAPA petition process needs to be included in the criteria. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>The statute is clear about the role of States inthe process of applying for demonstration grants. SDWA section 1427(c)indicates that if a jurisdiction other than a State applies for a grant,the applicant must have the Governor as a co-applicant when applying forSSA demonstration grant funds. In view of the clear statutory provisions,EPA does not believe any additional guidance in the CAPA rule is needed.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Implementation</ITAG>The SSA Demonstration Program is a limited one, which may entitle successfulapplicants to receive matching grants. The total amount of the grant cannotexceed $4 million per aquifer per year. As part of the demonstration program,any State, municipal or local government, or political subdivision thereofor any planning entity (including any interstate regional planning entity)that identified a CAPA over which it has authority or jurisdiction withinan already designated SSA, may apply for the demonstration program. Forfiscal years 1988 and 1989, Congress has not appropriated funds for demonstrationprogram grants. Detailed information on applying for demonstration grantfunds including procedures, application materials, and review criteriawill be released by EPA if funds are appropriated for demonstration programgrants in the future. A notice of availability of these application materialswould be published in the Federal Register.The Sole Source Aquifer Demonstration Program will not affect or inhibitAgency regulatory programs. The Agency does not intend to establish anadministrative program strictly to define and delineate CAPAs, but onlyas one ``screening'' step in the context of the demonstration program.The actual selection process will be addressed by the Agency when it issuesCAPA grants guidance.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Impact Analysis</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 9, l98l), EPA must judgewhether a regulation is ``major'' and, therefore, subject to the requirementof a Regulatory Impact Analysis.A major rule is defined as a regulation which is likely to result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers; individual industries;Federal, State, and local government agencies; or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.This rule to define critical aquifer protection areas is not major sinceit has no effect on the overall cost and economic impact of EPA's solesource aquifer regulations. Therefore, the Agency has not conducted a regulatoryimpact analysis. The draft of this rule was cleared by the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) pursuant to Executive Order 12291. A summary of commentsfrom OMB to EPA and EPA's response to these comments will be availablefor viewing at the Environmental Protection Agency, Room 801 East Tower,401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 through 612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and smallgovernmental jurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, thatthe rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. This regulation will impose no significant costs onany small entities. The overall economic impact, therefore, on small entitiesis small. Accordingly, I hereby certify that this regulation will not havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulation,therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Information Collection Requirements in this rule have been submittedfor approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act,</T3> 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> These requirements are not effective until OMB approvesthem and a technical amendment to that effect is published in the <T4> Federal Register.</T4>This rule in and of itself does not create any public reporting burden.Should funds be appropriated for the SSA Demonstration Program, EPA willissue Grants Guidance. As part of their application package pursuant tosuch Grant Guidance, it is anticipated that applicants will need to assertthat all CAPA criteria established in this rule are met. The public burdenassociated with asserting CAPA criteria are believed to represent perhapsl0 to 25 percent of the 1040 hours of total burden associated with completingan SSA Demonstration Program application. These estimates are consideredpreliminary in nature (pending Grant Guidance issuance), and include timefor reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. An Information Collection Request document (ICR No. 1431) has been preparedby EPA and a copy may be obtained from: Carla Levesque, Information PolicyBranch, EPA, 401 M Street, SW.
