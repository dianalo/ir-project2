(Masscomp) in 1981.andP;  Chap Cory,who is president of Augment, was an early stage founder of Xylogics, Inc.andO;Both companies evolved from private to public corporations.andM;Headquartered in Bedford, MA, Augment Systems' founding goal is to design,develop, manufacture and market high performance fiber optic link products --both hardware and software -- that enhance the throughput of high-endpersonal computers, workstations and larger computer systems.andP;  Unlike manystart-ups, however, Augment's products are already in use at nearly 20 U.S.andO;customer sites.andM;&quot;The company's founding vision is to develop innovative fiber optic basedlink products that truly augment the capabilities of existing workstations,servers and systems.andP;  While the company's product offering will grow toeventually include more complex, multi-board links and hubs for manyadditional computer buses, our founding goal will continue to guide alldevelopment efforts,&quot;  Cory said.andM;Augment's first product offering is being introduced and exhibited atBUSCON/90-EAST this week, a leading exposition and technical conference foropen architecture bus-board suppliers and users.andP;  Called the AL 100 Series,it uses fiber optic technology to enable direct high-speed communicationslinks between dissimilar computers at very low costs.andM;The AL 100 Series includes board-level products that link VMEbus systems(Sun, MIPS, Silicon Graphics, etc.) with NuBus (Apple Macintosh) computersand boards.andP;  Other products interconnect Unibus, Qbus and DR11-based DigitalEquipment computers and boards.andM;These Augment products complement local area networks and meet a growing needfor faster computer-to-computer connections.andP;  IBM and Fujitsu have recentlyannounced new mainframe products that incorporate high speed &quot;link&quot;technology similar to Augment's.andP;  Cory believes this reinforces the need forthis type of product.andM;&quot;While LANs continue to proliferate and provide a high percentage of theneeded communications capability, there remains a largely unmet need fordirect higher speed communication links between computers, and betweencomputers and attached processors.andM;&quot;This is the segment Augment is addressing with its initial products.andP;  Theneed for this technology not only exists at the mainframe level, but alsowith workstation and high-end PC users,&quot; Cory said.andM;AUGMENT SENIOR MANAGEMENT andamp; BOARD OF DIRECTORS Prior to co-founding Augment,Gale was vice president and general manager of Masscomp's Scientific ProductsGroup.andP;  He co-founded Masscomp and became that company's first vice presidentof engineering.andP;  Earlier, Gale was an engineering manager at DigitalEquipment Corp. for 14 years.andP;  He began his career at Ford Motor Co. in 1964.andM;Prior to co-founding Augment, Cory was senior vice president of marketingoperations and corporate development at Xylogics Inc. where he was an earlystage founder in 1977.andP;  Earlier, he held engineering positions at Polaroid.andO;Cory brings to Augment 23 years of experience in the computer field.andM;In addition to co-founders Gale and Cory, Augment's senior management teamalso includes Frank Baker, vice president of sales, and Geoffrey Rochat,director of engineering.andP;  Prior to Augment, Baker was regional vice presidentof sales at Artel Communications, a leading optical link supplier.andP;  He bringsto Augment 19 years of high tech sales experience.andM;Over a 12 year career, Rochat was responsible for communications productdesigns at Data General and Artel before joining Augment.andM;Augment currently has five board of director members.andP;  In addition to Galeand Cory, there are three outside executives with valuable industrialexperience.andM;Gordon Baty, partner at Zero Stage Capital, has over 20 years directoperating experience in several early stage ventures.andP;  He is the author ofEntrepreneurship for The Eighties (Prentice Hall) and a founder of the MITEnterprise Forum.andP;  Ted Johnson is a private investor and consultant who is a25-year veteran of Digital Equipment Corp., where he headed worldwide salesand service.andM;The third outside board member is Mort Ruderman, general partner of CRESDevelopment, Lynnfield, Mass.andP;  Also a Digital veteran, Ruderman additionallyfounded his own company, Meditech.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
