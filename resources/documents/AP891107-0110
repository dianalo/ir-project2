But administration officials maintained that the transfer ofmoney, which has been held for nearly a decade, was unrelated tothe plight of the hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Moslems.   The $567 million was being held in a fund to back up claims byAmerican banks against Iran. Most of those claims were settled inthe past few weeks.   As a result, U.S. officials said Monday night, the leftoverassets will be returned to the Bank of Iran. An additional $243million will be transferred to a special fund to back up otherAmerican claims against the Persian Gulf country.   Bush, speaking at a morning news conference, said he didn't knowwhat effect the money transfer would have on officials in Iran.   But, he added: ``I hope that they will do what they can toinfluence those who hold these hostages.'' He said he carries ``thefate of the hostages with me every single day.''   Referring to financial claims and counter-claims between theUnited States and Iran, the president said: ``I'd like to get thisunderbrush cleaned out now.''   While Iran has made some ``positive statements'' recently, hesaid the administration has so far run into ``dead ends'' inworking behind the scenes to free the hostages in Lebanon.   Meanwhile, former President Jimmy Carter said he also believes``the time has come for the Iranian assets to be unfrozen.''   ``I don't think we ought to be fearful,'' Carter told reportersduring a visit to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,at the Capitol.   ``It might lead ultimately to flexibility on the hostages,''Carter said.   On a related issue, Bush condemned supporters of Gen. MichelAoun, the Christian general who is opposed to a peace plan forLebanon ironed out by Moslems and Christians in the war-torncountry. Aoun's backers harrassed the Catholic patriarch who backedthe plan.   ``I am deeply offended by the Aoun supporters who tried tohumiliate the patriarch yesterday,'' the president said. `I justhope that before I leave this job that I can in some way contributeto the question of peace in Lebanon.''   The move on the Iranian assets followed talks in The Hague lastweek between Abraham Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser,and Iranian officials. A special tribunal set up in the Dutchcapital in 1981 has been considering conflicting claims.   U.S. officials said the decision to return the assets throughthe Bank of Iran was unrelated to the eight Americans being held inLebanon by a pro-Iranian faction.   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani offered help last month ingetting 18 Western hostages freed if the United States releasedbillions of dollars in frozen assets or helped settle the cases ofthree Iranians captured by Christian Lebanese militiamen in 1982.   Bush administration officials immediately responded they wouldnot engage in negotiations over the hostages and called onhumanitarian grounds for the release of all the hostages.   Sondra McCarty, a State Department spokeswoman, said Sofaer'stalks with Iranian officials in The Hague last Thursday and Fridayconcerned only claims matters. ``We are making no deals with anyoneabout the hostages,'' she said.   About $800 million had been held in a special fund againstclaims of American banks. ``Since most of the bank claims weresettled over the last several months, $567 million could bereturned to Iran and the remainder was transferred to a specialsecurity account to back up other claims,'' a U.S. official said.   That account is maintained at a minimum of $500 million, saidthe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The U.S.-Iranian claims commission was set up in 1981 as part ofthe arrangement that led to the release of American hostages heldfor 444 days in Tehran after seizure of the U.S. Embassy bymilitants.   There are several other claims issues outstanding, includingIran's demand for compensation for military equipment purchasedbefore the 1979 Islamic revolution but never delivered.   The United States transferred $9.9 billion in frozen assets tothe jurisdiction of the claims tribunal in 1981. Before the banks'settlement, some $3.8 billion had been transferred to Iran.   The $810 million involved in Monday's action had been reservedfor U.S. bank claims against Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
