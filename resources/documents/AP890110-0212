DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan will deliver his farewelladdress, billed as a ``very personal'' review of his presidency, bytelevision from the Oval Office on Wednesday night.   The speech is scheduled for 9 p.m. EST and will be carried liveby the television networks. It is expected to last about 20 minutes,White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.   He said Reagan has spent several hours working on it this week.   ``We expect it to be a very personal kind of look at whatPresident Reagan tried to do, and what he sees as hisaccomplishments, and the problems ahead,'' Fitzwater said.   ``It will be an opportunity for him to talk directly to theAmerican people as he has done so often in the last eight years.''   A few of Reagan's notable previous speeches from the Oval Officeincluded:   _ July 27, 1981, in which he used charts and a pointer to makehis point that the administration's tax reduction plan was more fairthan that proposed by the Democrats in Congress. He prevailed, withCongress passing a plan along the lines he had proposed.   _ March, 23, 1983, in which he took some of his own key advisersby surprise by announcing he was ordering a study of the thenlittle-known concept of building a system to defend against missileattack. The idea came to be known as Star Wars and became a subjectof domestic dispute and of contention with the Soviet Union.   _ Jan. 28, 1986, often cited as one of his most memorable, inwhich, within a few hours of the explosion that killed the sevenmembers of the space shuttle Challenger crew, he mourned their lossbut vowed that the U.S. space program would go on.   _ Nov. 13, 1986, generally regarded as one of his leastpersuasive, in which he tried to deflect criticism of hisadministration's sales of arms to Iran, denying they represented anattempt to swap arms for American hostages.   Reagan, a former movie actor and radio announcer, came to theWhite House better equipped with television-related skills than anyof his predecessors.   In addition to his career as an entertainer, he had made a splashin 1964 with a speech on behalf of Republican presidential candidateBarry Goldwater that set him on the way to a new career in politics.   Wednesday night's speech will follow a tradition of farewelladdresses that has included many previous presidents, from GeorgeWashington to Jimmy Carter.   Washington's farewell address, attacking ``the spirit of party''and warning against foreign entanglements, has become a classicwhich is still read annually in Congress on the first president'sbirthday.   The most celebrated previous presidential address of thetelevision era is Dwight Eisenhower's on Jan. 17, 1961, warningagainst ``the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether soughtor unsought, by the military-industrial complex.''   Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, both former congressionalleaders, chose to make their final speeches in the form of State ofthe Union addresses to Congress, as some other presidents have done.   Carter spoke from the Oval Office on Jan. 14, 1981, six daysbefore Reagan took office, promising his successor his support ``tothe very limits of conscience and conviction'' and warning of theneed to reduce the ``horrifying danger'' of nuclear arms stockpiles.</TEXT></DOC>
