This notice, however, does not address the finalapproval of sections 17-2.600(4)(c)7 and 8, that allow the State to approvealternative emission limits or an alternative new technology without EPAapproval. EPA will act to approve or disapprove these provisions in a laternotice. This approach, approving the TRS plan while deferring action onthe alternative emission limit and alternative new technology provisions,was requested by the FDER on January 8, 1988, in order to expedite theapproval of the other portions of the plan. Since the emission limits andother provisions contained in the rules submitted with the TRS plan agreesubstantially with the emission limits suggested in the EPA guideline documententitled <T3>Kraft Pulping_Control of TRS Emissions From Existing Mills</T3> (EPA-450/2-78-003b),it is appropriate to move forward with the approval of the other rulesas submitted. However, to complete its plan, the State is required pursuantto 40 CFR 60.24(e) to submit for EPA's approval individual compliance schedulescontaining acceptable increments of progress pursuant to 40 CFR 60.21(h);such schedules must meet the public hearing requirements of 40 CFR 60.23or ones deemed equivalent by the Administrator pursuant to 40 CFR 60.23(g).At this time, EPA is also approving a plan revision submited by the FDERon June 10, 1986; this revised a portion of the May 1985 submittal (Rule17-2.960) which provided that the compliance calendar of events for sourcessubject to the plan would not start until EPA acted to finally approvethe plan. Since EPA had not acted to approve the plan within the year followingsubmission of the plan due to complications, Florida elected to start thecompliance calendar of events on May 12, 1986. EPA is including this revisionin this notice without previous proposal because EPA views it as a noncontroversialamendment to the plan which provides for earlier compliance with the emissionlimits that would have otherwise occurred due to delays in approving theplan. Also, on August 14, 1986, The FDER submitted a revision which removed aportion of the original section 17-2.600(4)(c)8 which provided that thesection would become inoperative if EPA should fail to approve it at thesame time as it approved the other portions of the plan. This revisionis duly noted and will be incorporated in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice addressing section 17-2.600(4)(c)7 and8.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>dates:</T2> This rule will become effective on September 9, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>addresses:</T2> Copies of the documents relevant to this action areavailable for public inspection during normal business hours at the followinglocations:<ITAG tagnum="15">Environmental Protection Agency, Region IV, Air Programs Branch, 345Courtland Street NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Florida Department of Environmental Regulation, Bureau of Air QualityManagement, Twin Towers Office Building, 2600 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee,Florida 32301-8241.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact:</T2> Stuart Perry of the EPA RegionIV Air Programs Branch at the address given above, telephone (404) 347-2864or FTS 257-2864.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information:</T2> In accordance with section 111 of theClean Air Act, ``Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources,''EPA has promulgated standards of performance for criteria pollutants (thosefor which National Ambient Air Quality Standards have been published) andnoncriteria pollutants. The standards apply to ``new'' sources (i.e., new,modified, or reconstructed sources) which commenced construction afterthe date on which EPA proposed standards for that particular source category.A source in existence prior to the date on which EPA proposed new sourceperformance standards for that particular source category is defined asan ``existing source.'' Paragraph (d) of section 111 of the Clean Air Actrequires states to develop plans for the control of emissions of the samenon-criteria, or designated, pollutants from such ``existing'' sources.The requirements for such plans are set forth in Subpart B of 40 CFR Part60. (November 17, 1975; 40 FR 53346). Since total reduced sulfur (TRS)is a designated pollutant, regulated under section 111(d) of the CAA, statesare required to develop section 111(d) plans for the control of TRS emissionsfrom existing kraft pulp mills contained in the state. The TRS compounds regulated under section 111(d) are considered welfare-relatedpollutants. This means that although their effects are bothersome, theyare not health-threatening, and some leeway may be allowed in their control.In other words, although EPA's guideline document (<T3>Kraft Pulping-Control of TRS Emissions from Existing Mills</T3> (EPA-450/2-78-003b))suggests emission limits, control technologies, etc., limits other thanthose recommended by EPA may be adopted by the State provided adequatejustification is given. The FDER submitted its section 111(d) plan for control of TRS emissionsfrom kraft pulp mills and tall oil plants on May 24, 1985. This submittalcontained certification that adoption of the plan had been preceded byadequate notice and public hearing. The plan as submitted contains all the elements needed for an approvablesection 111(d) plan pursuant to 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart B (Adoption andSubmittal of State Plans for Designated Facilities), and the guidelinedocument. This plan submittal included: regulations establishing emissionstandards for all affected sources along with the adoption of necessarydefinitions; regulations establishing the definitions; regulations establishingthe procedures for the development of individual source compliance schedulesto include increments of progress; regulations establishing test methodsand procedures for determining compliance with the emission standards;an emission inventory of all designated facilities; regulations establishingprocedures for monitoring the status of compliance with emission standardsthrough record-keeping, periodic inspections, and testing; and documentationthat the State has legal authority to carry out the plan.For a more detailed discussion of the Florida TRS plan, please refer tothe October 28, 1986, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 39400). Further details pertaining tothis plan are contained in the Technical Support Document. These documentsare available for public inspection at EPA Regional office in Atlanta,Georgia and the Public Information Reference Unit in Washington, DC, whoseaddresses are listed above.For the convenience of the reader, the following Florida AdministrativeCode Rules were revised as a result of the development of the TRS plan:1. Rule 17-2.100 (Definitions)2. Rule 17-2.600(4) (Kraft (Sulfate) Pulp Mills and Tall Oil Plants)3. Rule 17-2.660 (Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources (NSPS))4. Rule 17-2.700 (Stationary Point Source Emissions Test Procedures)5. Rule 17-2.710 (Continuous Monitoring Requirements)6. Addition of a new part (Part IX) which includes new Rule 17-2.960 (ComplianceSchedules for Specific Source Emission Limiting Standards) and 17-2.971(Compliance Schedules for Continuous Monitoring Requirements).Rule 17-2.660 was originally approved as part of the Florida state implementationplan (SIP). However, this action should not have been taken since NSPSregulations are not required by section 110 of the Act to be part of aSIP. EPA has no adverse comments on the proposed changes to Rule 17-2.660,and will use the changed version as the basis for future delegations ofauthority. However, EPA will take no action on the revisions to the Rule.On October 28, 1986, EPA proposed to approve the Florida TRS plan in itsentirety, but identified points in its bubble provisions which the Statewould have to clarify prior to EPA's final approval. At that time, thepublic was invited to submit written comments on the proposed action. Threecomment submittals were received. However, two of these submittals werein response to points brought out about the bubble provisions. Since theapproval of sections 7 and 8 are not being considered in this notice, considerationof the above comments is deferred until EPA addresses the approvabilityof the plan's bubble provisions. The third comment urged EPA to reconsiderits position stated in the proposal notice that ``before EPA can approvethe Florida TRS plan, Florida must submit for EPA approval compliance schedulescontaining acceptable increments of progress; such schedules must be subjectedto public hearings.'' EPA agrees with this comment, since advance submittalis not required by 40 CFR 60.24(e). Therefore, EPA is approving the FloridaTRS plan prior to the submittal of compliance schedules by the State. However,the State will still need to submit the compliance schedules for EPA approvalin order to have a complete plan.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>EPA is approving the Florida 111(d) plan for control of total reduced sulfur(TRS) emissions from kraft pulp mills and tall oil plants which was submittedto EPA on May 24, 1985, with the exception of sections 17-2.600(4)(c) 7and 8, on which EPA is deferring action at this time. The approval of sections17.2.600(4)(c) 7 and 8 will be addressed in a separate notice at a laterdate. EPA is also deferring action on a revision to section 17-2.600(4)(c)8submitted on August 14, 1986, which revised a portion of the May 24, 1985,submittal. This revision will be incorporated in the notice addressingthe approval of section 17-2.600(4)(c) 7 and 8. In addition, EPA is approvinga revision to Rule 17-2.960 submitted on June 10, 1986, which revised aportion of the May 24, 1985, submittal regarding the start of the compliancecalendar of events. EPA's final approval of the Florida TRS plan does notrelieve the State of Florida from the requirement pursuant 40 CFR 60.24(e)to submit to EPA for approval individual source compliance schedules containingacceptable increments of progress pursuant to 40 CFR 60.21(h); and theseschedules must meet the public hearing requirements of 40 CFR 60.23 orones deemed equivalent by the Administrator pursuant to 40 CFR 60.23(g).The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by October 11, 1988. This action may not be challenged later inproceedings to enforce its requirements.
