Almost pleading, Salomon's chief operating officer, DeryckMaughan, told federal lawmakers yesterday, &quot;We want to bepart of the future of the government-securities market, notjust part of its past.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Officials at the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasuryhave begun hinting that they will let that happen. They arereaching this conclusion not so much out of sympathy for thebig securities firm -- though they have been swayed byinterim Chairman Warren Buffett and his abject, tell-allapproach -- as out of fear of what a collapse of Salomon Inc.could do to the financial markets.   In this view, Salomon, like some major banks, is simplytoo big to fail. New York Federal Reserve Board PresidentGerald Corrigan is known to be especially concerned about themarket impact of a catastrophe at Salomon.   Mr. Maughan invoked that fear in his testimony before theHouse Ways and Means oversight subcommittee yesterday,warning that overly harsh punishment of Salomon could ripplethrough the entire financial system, in turn sharply raisingthe costs of the government's massive financing needs. &quot;Ifyou fell this tree, what other trees would fall?&quot; he asked.   That argument, perceived by some Bush administrationofficials as arrogant, also had one senior Fed officialsuggesting that Salomon's defense of itself could backfire.In an interview, this official responded: &quot;Big trees fallhard, too.&quot;   Still, in the end, Salomon is likely to remain a primarydealer in the government securities market, albeit with someconditions attached, such as a probationary period.   Yet, ironically, as a direct result of the Salomonscandal, being a primary dealer of Treasury securities islikely to be less profitable, because the entire system isalmost certain to be altered by Washington officialsre-examining how the government sells its debt. Also, savingSalomon's primary-dealer status doesn't by itself ensure thefirm's survival. Another crucial question is Salomon'sability to continue to fund its operations by borrowingbillions of dollars.   What's more, all bets about mercy from Washington are offif the wrongdoing at Salomon is revealed to be far moreextensive than already disclosed. That possibility was raisedat yesterday's hearing when the chairman of the Securitiesand Exchange Commission revealed that the agency isinvestigating whether there were links between violations bySalomon's government-securities desk and its foreign-exchangeoperation.   &quot;It is possible to manipulate interest rates and seek toprofit from that in the foreign-exchange markets,&quot; SEC chiefRichard Breeden told the panel. &quot;I can tell you for sure thatwe are looking at it.&quot; The firm's government-securities andforeign-exchange desks both were run by Paul Mozer, amanaging director who has since been fired by the firm.   The firm appeared to soften its denials of links, pendingthe outcome of additional study. &quot;We have not yet done athorough, auction-by-auction review of foreign-exchangetrading,&quot; said general counsel Robert Denham. &quot;We have donesome limited interviewing and we will do more.&quot; Any such tiewould represent a significant widening of the scope ofviolations at the firm.   Also at the hearing, Salomon disclosed for the first timethat it made &quot;millions&quot; of dollars from cornering the marketalong with customers in the May auction for two-year Treasurynotes, but said it lost money at some of the other auctions.Mr. Maughan said that Salomon and the SEC are still puttingtogether a model to determine the exact amounts of profit andloss from the trades, which could help determine the amountof any SEC fine.   In addition, two issuers of government-agency debttestified that overbidding and false reporting were far morecommon than they had expected. The Federal Home Loan MortgageCorp. disclosed that 18 of the 19 dealers that had respondedto a request for information admitted hyping their bids sothat they could receive more of the agency's debt when it wasdivided among the bidders. The other six members of theagency's dealer group hadn't yet responded.   Separately, the Senate passed legislation that would makefalsifying bids at Treasury auctions or to goverment agenciespunishable under the federal securities laws. The measure,passed by voice vote, would broaden the authority of the SECand the exchanges to take on firms that submit false bids.   Salomon's pain is far from finished. Having all butdecided not to kill Salomon, government officials now aredebating how close the firm can be pushed to the cliff's edgewithout going over. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York,which is closest to the markets both physically andpsychologically, is understood to favor less draconian termsthan Fed officials in Washington.   But both sides worry about the roughly $600 billion ofoff-balance sheet deals -- interest-rate swaps, currencyswaps and other esoteric instruments -- that are intricatelyhedged in markets around the world. Any government actionthat crippled Salomon or caused its lenders to loseconfidence in the firm could, they worry, trigger defaultsand financial gridlock of a size that regulators have neverbefore had to handle, even during the 1987 market crash.   Salomon is trying to reinforce the government's mix ofworries and good will by making the case that it has learnedits lesson and cleaned house. This two-pronged campaign offear and repentance appears to be working. Earlier this week,for example, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan praised Salomon'scooperation and said that would be a factor in determiningthe firm's ultimate penalty.   Mr. Buffett's down-home Nebraska candor has been asalluring to cynical Washingtonians as it has been for decadesto hard-boiled Wall Streeters. He has cast himself as thegood guy so successfully that Washington officials sometimesforget that it's not just altruism that motivates him. At arecent hearing, for example, Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.)took time out from a bullying series of questions for otherwitnesses and apologized before asking Mr. Buffett the sizeof his investment in the firm he's trying to save. (Answer:$700 million.)   Other key figures are similarly succumbing to Mr.Buffett's charms. When asked in an interview about possiblepenalties against the firm, one administration officialparroted Mr. Buffett's congressional testimony, saying: &quot;Weneed to worry about the 8,000 Salomon employees and theirfamilies.&quot;   Indeed, some in the government now argue that they mustreward Salomon for a level of cooperation unprecedented onWall Street. &quot;There is a sense that they really are trying tocooperate,&quot; says one senior administration staffer. &quot;Thatcertainly has to figure in. If people see that you don't getanything for it, people aren't going to come in and helpout.&quot;   Separately, Salomon retained Gary Naftalis, the lawyer whorepresented Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. when it was threatened withcriminal charges in 1987, according to individuals withknowledge of the hiring. A former prosecutor, Mr. Naftalis iscredited with keeping Kidder from being charged with criminalwrongdoing. Instead, the firm settled civil SECinsider-trading charges for $25.3 million in penaltiesstemming from the case of Martin Siegel, the former Kiddertakeover specialist who pleaded guilty to two felonies.   Criminal prosecution can jeopardize the existence of asecurities firm because many clients won't deal with a firmthat has faced criminal charges and many foreign governmentsand state regulators won't license such a firm.</TEXT></DOC>
