In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the New York maker of computerized typesetting and electronic publishing systems said it has been in contact with Triad Systems since Oct. 7, expressing its interest in such a transaction, and tried unsuccessfuly to set up a meeting Wednesday between Triad Systems' president, James R. Porter, and Volt's chairman, William Shaw.    Mr. Shaw sent a letter to Triad Systems indicating Volt's &quot;continuing interest&quot; in a leveraged buy-out and requested a chance to review the company. Volt said it plans to seek further discussions with management, and said those talks may include proposals for a merger or a purchase of all or some of the company's business. Volt might also pursue &quot;a number of different strategies&quot; involving taking control of Triad Systems, the filing said.    According to the filing, Volt owns 986,500 Triad Systems' common shares, all purchased from Sept. 19 to Wednesday for $14.25 to $15.125 each. Volt said it decided the shares would make an &quot;attractive investment&quot; in light of Triad Systems' announcement that Mr. Porter was considering a management-led buy-out at around $15 a share.    Officials of Triad Systems, a computer manufacturing and leasing concern based in Livermore, Calif., weren't available to comment. Although Mr. Porter in September said he was considering a buy-out, earlier this month the 52-year-old executive suffered a mild heart attack and decided to defer his plan. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Triad Systems stock closed at $14.625, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
