The moves show that the nation's largest manufacturerexpects the current recession to be both long and deep -- insharp contrast to the optimistic outlook being expressed bytop government officials. GM executives acknowledge that theywouldn't have cut the dividend had they expected a quickrebound for the economy, consumer confidence and car sales.</LP><TEXT>   The dividend cut, the first since early 1980, means GMshareholders will get a first-quarter payout of 40 cents acommon share instead of 75 cents. For GM, that means a $210million cash savings this quarter alone, and $840 million insavings for the full year.   By cutting its dividend so sharply, GM surprised someanalysts, who'd expected the company to follow Ford MotorCo., which decided last month to hold its $3-a-share annualdividend, at least for now. GM's move could make it easierfor Ford or Chrysler Corp. to cut their dividends as early asApril.   GM isn't stopping with the dividend reduction. In actionsapproved at a board meeting in New York yesterday, GMordered:   -- Capital spending cut by $500 million a year to about $7billion a year for the 1991-1994 period.   -- 15,000 North American white-collar jobs slashed fromthe payrolls by 1993, starting with the elimination of 6,000salaried jobs this year.   -- Payments to parts suppliers cut by a total of $2billion a year by 1993. This would be accomplished bydemanding &quot;substantial&quot; price rollbacks from suppliers ineach of the next three years.   -- No executive bonuses for 1990, &quot;except in a few caseswhere modest awards were made to recognize outstandingresults at selected subsidiary units.&quot; In effect, GMofficials say, that means executives at GM's highlyprofitable European subsidiary may get bonuses, butexecutives of the grossly unprofitable North Americanoperations won't.   These moves could save GM more than $5 billion during thenext four years, not including the dividend cut. If GM holdsa $1.60 annual common stock payout through 1994, that couldsave another $3.4 billion for a total of at least $8.4billion over four years.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchangeyesterday, GM's stock slid 87.5 cents a share to $35.25 ashare.   All this amounts to strong medicine, but GM clearly needsit. The auto maker's core North American vehicle operationswere barely profitable in the late 1980s, even when industrysales were good. Now, consumers in the U.S., as well as manyEuropean countries, are postponing new car purchases as theyworry about the Persian Gulf war, or economic hard times athome.   The result: GM's North American car and truck business isgushing red ink. Later this month, GM is expected to report afourth-quarter loss of as much as $1.4 billion -- potentiallythe largest quarterly loss on operations ever by any automaker. In addition, the company had a $2 billion loss for thethird quarter of 1990, after a big one-time charge forclosing factories idled as its U.S. market share plungedduring the 1980s. Thus, GM will show a net loss of up to $1.8billion for 1990, and only a slim $300 million profit onoperations.   The new year is off to an even worse start. The company isslashing North American car and truck production to levelsnot seen since the last recession, and many analysts say GMcould post a loss for all of 1991 unless the economy reboundsstrongly and soon. It would be the first time in more than 60years that GM has posted two straight annual losses.   But Chairman Robert C. Stempel -- who took the helm lastAug. 1, the day before the start of the Gulf crisis that isexacerbating GM's woes -- isn't waiting for that recovery.Instead, he appears to be using the recession and themounting losses to force the company's sprawling bureaucracyto confront the need for rapid, painful change.   &quot;We can't afford to be tentative,&quot; Mr. Stempel said in astatement issued after the markets closed yesterday. &quot;Wecan't rely on an eventual economic turnaround alone to securean adequate financial return for our stockholders over thelonger term.&quot;   What Mr. Stempel apparently intends to do, instead, isadminister a form of shock therapy to an organization thatfor years tried to assure itself that its problems weretemporary. When GM raised its annual common-stock dividend to$3 a share from $2.50 two years ago, then-Chairman Roger B.Smith said the company's earnings could support the newpayout level over the long term. No one foresaw a war at thatpoint, of course, but it was clear that GM's core NorthAmerican auto operations were ill-prepared for a recession ofany sort.   There has been speculation that Mr. Stempel could take theshock treatment a significant step further by asking theUnited Auto Workers union to reopen the rich contract signedlast fall. That pact gives laid-off GM workers up to 95% ofpay for as long as three years. Thus, in effect, labor is afixed cost that can't be reduced during short-term salesslumps.   But GM's executive vice president for finance, Robert T.O'Connell, said yesterday there are &quot;no current plans&quot; toreopen talks with the UAW. And union officials warned such arequest would be met with stiff opposition.   &quot;It's one of the unthinkables,&quot; one UAW local officialsaid yesterday.   GM last asked the UAW to reopen a contract in January1982, nine months before the pact was scheduled to expire. InMarch 1982, the UAW agreed to make wage and benefitsconcessions. Later that spring, GM enraged UAW leaders byannouncing that its executives had received bonuses despitethe recession.   As he takes a knife to GM's operations, Mr. Stempel istrying to preserve the heart of an aggressive new-productdevelopment program. The 6%-a-year cut in capital spendingwill result in $2 billion saved over four years. But the cutsin each individual year aren't dramatic; $500 million isroughly what it takes to give a facelift to one line of cars.   Where GM hopes to save big money is by simplifying itsproduct offerings and the bureaucracy that designs, sells andoversees the manufacture of them.   For example, GM wants to reduce to five from nine thenumber of different engine types it offers. It's redesigningits cars so that several different models can be built in thesame factory. Designers are working to reduce the number ofparts in GM's cars, to make them easier and less expensive tobuild.   Further, GM wants to change the way it does business withsuppliers. It wants parts makers to work under long-termcontracts that call for price reductions over the life of acar, and it wants fewer companies shipping parts to GMplants.   With fewer suppliers and simpler design and manufacturingprocesses, GM officials believe the company shouldn't need asmany accountants, purchasing agents, or factory supervisors.   The problem is, GM is playing catch up. Toyota Motor Corp.and other Japanese manufacturers have a long head-start indesigning cars so they're cheap and easy to build. Ford Motordoes a better job of running its factories with fewer blue-and white-collar workers.   But GM executives say they're confident they can cut theircosts drastically over the next four years. Mr. O'Connellsaid the total cost savings by 1994 could be &quot;greater&quot; thanthe $13 billion GM already has cut from its 1986 cost levels.   Separately, GM said it's raising the quarterly payout onits Class E common shares, which reflect a dividend interestin the earnings of GM's Electronic Data Systems Corp. unit,to 16 cents a share from 14 cents a share. The quarterlydividend for GM Class H common shares, tied to theperformance of the GM Hughes Electronics unit, was maintainedat 18 cents a share. All GM stock dividends are payable March9 to shareholders of record Feb. 14.   ---   Gregory A. Patterson contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
