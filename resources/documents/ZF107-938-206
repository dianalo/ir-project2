 As well, he has heldsenior management positions with TRW and Consolidated Computers Inc.andM;Educated in both electronic engineering and business management, Best is alsoa member of the executive advisory committee of Guelph University and a pastdirector of the Information Technology Association of Canada (ITAC).andM;Best recently spoke to Computing Canada editor Martin Slofstra.andM;FonorolaandM;Fonorola provides and resells long distance telephone services to businesscustomers.andM;It currently offers services from the Toronto and Montreal areas into theUnited States and abroad.andM;It is a federally chartered non-regulated Canadian company and operateswithin the rules of the Canadian Radio-television and TelecommunicationsCommission (CRTC).andM;CC: First of all, describe the service you offer.andM;Best: We offer long distance phone service from Canada to the United Statesand abroad.andP;  We purchase Bell Canada services, and we resell it at thediscount.andP;  The way of doing that is buying it in bulk and resell it as anynormal distributor or any normal wholesaler would do.andP;  We started with directdial services.andP;  Over the year, we will introduce other services such as 800numbers, 900 numbers, dedicated lines for voice and data and T1 services.andO;But at the moment, it's just direct dial.andM;CC: Are you restricted on what you can do under share and resell regulationsas set by the CRTC.andM;Best: The restriction that we have is that we must at one end of our circuitbe directly connected to the customer.andP;  We cannot switch in to our network.andO;You can't dial us up, and then connect in.andP;  We have to have a directconnection to your facility and to your PBX.andP;  That's why it's actually easierfor people to sell dedicated circuits then it is the dialing circuits.andM;CC: We bear a about value-added reselling in the computer business, less soin telecommunications.andP;  Is that the type of service you offer?andM;Best: The added value services are a little less easy to define in thetelecommunications business than they are in the computer business.andP;  You buya piece of hardware in computers, and most of the value-added is in thesoftware design and development for the customer.andP;  In telecommunicationsyou're offering a base service that is the ability of someone to communicatefrom point A to point B.andP;  The base value is that you offer that as quality.andO;In voice quality, it is that you get connected and you can hear the person atthe other end.andP;  In data, it is that you never have a problem.andP;  You don't losebits and bytes and you don't have a million dollar account that suddenly getsdropped to one hundred thousand.andP;  To offer added value to that gets a littlemore complex, because it depends on the degree of what the customer wants.andO;Most of us who use the phone want to get connected quickly and with goodquality.andM;CC: Value-added reselling of long distance service is a growing area inCanada and there must be a lot of competition.andP;  How do you differentiate yourservice from the rest?andM;Best: At the moment there are a number of competitors in the Canada-to-U.S.andO;connection service.andP;  Our differentiation is that we have decided to go fortop quality.andP;  We, first of all, purchased T1s that are fibre and ourswitching connections are in Toronto and Montreal.andP;  We then take theconnection over our fibre circuits which we purchased -- leased by Fonorola-- and we switch into the U.S.andP;  network in Buffalo, N.Y.andP;  and Albany, N.Y.andM;CC: As a reseller, would you have any equipment of your own?andM;Best: Yes.andP;  The equipment that we've purchased has been the switchingequipment from Northern Telecom.andP;  This equipment is used to switch ourcustomers into the U.S.andP;  direct dial network.andP;  We use ATandamp;T, MCI and Sprint.andO;The routine is geared to whoever provides us the best value for the service.andO;We also have multiplexors in Canada.andP;  We purchased those from Newbridge.andO;They allow us to multiplex the lines through the fibre optic T1s that we usebetween Toronto and Buffalo, and between Montreal and Albany.andP;  We also have abilling system, which is tied into our two switches in Buffalo and Albanythat provides the billing information.andP;  It's a very sophisticated system.andM;CC: What other services do you see in the future that would fit under thatumbrella of value-added?andM;Best: Value-added, first of all, is flexibility in billing organizations.andP;  Wecan lay out the bill, within reason, to the way any customer requires.andP;  We dohave certain formats we recommend, but there's flexibility.andP;  We will alsooffer connection to the 800 services in the United States and we can offer900 service.andM;We'll offer dedicated lines from here to the United States.andP;  We're looking at56 Kbps switched services.andP;  We are also looking at offering a telephonecredit card service.andP;  We will also get into offering network design andsupport for customers.andP;  We can assist them in developing their own networks,with of course, the thought that they lease their circuits from Fonorola.andP;  Wewill also be looking at going further in setting up international networks.andM;CC: At some point in the evolution of your company, are you going to go moreinto mixing and matching?andP;  Right now your work is done through, primarily, ifnot exclusively with Bell.andM;Best: Bell from here to the United States.andP;  As we grow and develop we willlook at all suppliers of telephone services.andP;  Our only requirement is thatthey meet our standards and specifications, and that they provide goodquality service, we'll certainly use them.andM;CC: What type of telecom users are your trying to target?andM;Best: We're aiming at the moment at corporate.andP;  We have established ourselvesin Montreal and Toronto, and of course being a start up as we are, we have tolook at the business world for long distance.andP;  That represents the majortraffic to the United States during normal business hours.andM;CC: How many customers?andM;Best: I changes daily.andP;  At the moment we have about 25 to 30 customers.andO;There's a lot of interest and there's a lot of demand because we feel thatwe're offering a quality service and that's what people want.andM;CC: Are Canadian organizations content to stick only with Bell or do you findthat more and more are willing to try alternative services?andM;Best: I think like everyone, when they look at their expenses increasingevery year, the telephone costs become an issue.andP;  If you're offering aservice that is less expensive than they're used to paying, but the qualityremains the same, they're going to take advantage of it.andP;  That's what we'reseeing.andM;CC: There is a rather large discrepancy between rates paid for long distancebetween U.S.andP;  and Canada.andP;  From your standpoint, do you see that changing?andM;Best: I think it's a problem in the industry.andP;  But I think you'll see thatlike all companies that start to compete, Bell and others will be offeringcheaper circuits as we all enter into the, I use the word re-regulatory,world.andP;  I don't think it will be deregulated.andP;  Canada has never deregulatedanything, they just seem to re-regulate.andP;  We'll see prices coming down.andP;  Thedifference is that in the United States they were forced to compete, whereasin Canada we do it by market pressures and an attitude that it is time tochange.andM;CC: So we'll see gradual rate rebalancing as opposed to wide opencompetition?andM;Best: That is an interesting question, whether or not we have wide opencompetition.andP;  We unfortunately in Canada have a balkanized system oftelephone controls which the recent court case between Alberta GovernmentTelephone and CNCP may have resolved.andP;  We're a large country and we want thesame level of service that everyone else gets, especially the United States.andO;It's just that we have to be a little slower.andP;  We also have a strongobligation to provide phone service for every person in this country.andM;CC: From a telecom manager's perspective, he has more than just voice trafficto think about.andP;  One is the capability to mix voice and data.andP;  Presumably,you offer both.andM;Best: We are going to offer both services, voice and data.andP;  At the moment, wetend to just offer voice, but our plan is to offer voice and data.andP;  That willbe in the next two months.andM;CC: There's a lot of entrepreneurial firms in the telecom industry in Canada.andO;Would you put Fonorola in that category.andM;Best: Well it is, we're a start-up Like anyone else, when you start youreally are entrepreneurial.andP;  You're investing money into a new opportunityand you're trying to make sure it's successful.andP;  We feel strongly that wehave taken the stance as a company with quality as a major point.andP;  It's morethan likely re-emphasized over and over again, but we have to be equal to thebest there is.andP;  Bell Canada has set a very high standard.andP;  We better be readyto equal or exceed that.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
