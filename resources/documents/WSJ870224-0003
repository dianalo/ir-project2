But the plan by the Australian-born press magnate to fatten his London papers with extra advertising is filled with risks, analysts say. Rival publishers have set off a newspaper war that threatens to wrest at least some readers away from him, and analysts say London may be heading toward a newspaper glut.    But Mr. Murdoch, whose media empire spans three continents, seems unconcerned. Little more than a year after his News International PLC moved its newspaper operations to a new $153 million high-technology printing plant in the industrial district of Wapping, he's building a second plant there to triple the company's already-hefty printing capacity by 1989.    Three Murdoch newspapers -- the flagship Times, the racy Sun tabloid and the Sunday News of the World -- will be substantially boosted in size. And the highbrow Sunday Times will balloon to 200 pages, an unheard-of bulk in Britain.    The plans coincide with today's launch by Mr. Murdoch's archrival in London, Robert Maxwell, of a new evening tabloid newspaper, the London Daily News. Mr. Maxwell, who has splashed London Daily News billboard ads and free preview issues across the city, boasts that the paper's five daily editions will have 600,000 readers within three years -- 150,000 of them snatched from competing morning papers.    Lord Rothermore, proprietor of the Standard, retaliated by announcing the relaunch today of the Evening News, which merged with the Standard in 1980.    &quot;As more papers come on the market, it becomes more difficult to increase circulation,&quot; says News International spokesman Arthur Brittenden. &quot;But it does become possible to increase advertising revenue. We think the advertising is out there.&quot;    But the bid for increased advertising could be risky, according to advertising executives. &quot;It doesn't take a genius to work out there are an awful lot of newspapers out there,&quot; says Brian Jacobs, media director of advertising agency Leo Burnett Ltd. &quot;You may well have a case of too many papers chasing too-little money.&quot;    At Ogilvy andamp; Mather, assistant media director Bill Patterson issues a different warning. &quot;The more advertising News International sells, the more difficult it is to make it stand out,&quot; he says, adding that the Sunday Times car ads section &quot;already is a graveyard.&quot;    Others doubt readers will plough through a local version of the Sunday New York Times, which with supplements typically runs well over 400 pages. Tradition-bound British readers may not want &quot;strips of news interlaced with advertising&quot; and a newspaper that can't slide through their front-door mail slots, says Derek Terrington, publishing analyst at Phillips andamp; Drew.    Mr. Murdoch's expansion plan &quot;is a bold strategy&quot; in the highly competitive U.K. newspaper market, says Tony Pennie, an analyst at James Capel andamp; Co. &quot;But then, Mr. Murdoch is a very bold man.&quot;    Last year's bold move to Wapping, and Mr. Murdoch's subsequent decision to fire about 5,500 printers in a bid to break the Fleet Street unions, paid off earlier this month when two printers' unions finally called off a yearlong strike against News International. Circulation fell slightly during the walkout, but News International continued to print and distribute its newspapers.    News International, which already sells more newspapers than any other British publisher, is going after more advertising money because it doesn't believe it can increase circulation much more.    The city already has 12 daily and nine Sunday newspapers. Last year alone, two new dailies were created: the Today tabloid and the more intellectual Independent. Of the more than 15 million copies of London-based newspapers sold every day from July to December last year, Mr. Murdoch's account for roughly 4.5 million, or 30%.    Mr. Maxwell, the publisher, declares he's &quot;not at all worried&quot; by Mr. Murdoch's planned expansion. He points out that Mr. Murdoch announced last month that News International would scrub the planned start-up of its own evening paper.    Mr. Brittenden admits News International canceled its evening paper because it couldn't compete with Mr. Maxwell's Daily News. But he adds that &quot;if Mr. Maxwell fails, that might be another chance for us to start an evening paper.&quot;    He declines to disclose the Murdoch group's advertising revenue, but media analysts put it at about $230 million a year. Analysts expect Mr. Murdoch to use the additional revenue as collateral for financing the expansion of his burgeoning media empire in the U.S. and Australia.    His U.S. holdings include the New York Post and seven television stations. In Australia, he just won a battle with entrepreneur Robert Holmes a Court for control of Herald andamp; Weekly Times Ltd., the country's biggest media group.    While Mr. Murdoch proceeds to expand, the competition increases. Mr. Brittenden acknowledges losing about 30,000 Times readers to the Independent, but says the company is confident of winning them back.    To help settle the strike, the company expects to pay about $92 million to the fired printers. But a company source says News International saved roughly $107 million in labor costs last year. &quot;You can't see the strike in any other way than a victory&quot; for Mr. Murdoch, says Mr. Terrington, the analyst.    There's no doubt Mr. Murdoch's newspapers remain popular. The Sun, with its daily picture of a bare-breasted woman on page three, remains Britain's highest-circulation paper. The Sunday Times retains its reputation as &quot;the establishment paper,&quot; says Mr. Patterson of Ogilvy andamp; Mather. &quot;Basically, the Sunday Times is a gold mine,&quot; he says. &quot;News International has enormous demand for their product.&quot;    ---         BRITAIN'S PRESS   Average Circulation, July-Dec. 1986 DAILIES: Sun                        4,049,991 Daily Mirror               3,139,079 Daily Mail                 1,732,413 Daily Express              1,728,504 Star                       1,278,058 Daily Telegraph            1,131,597 The Guardian                 506,866 London Standard              504,388 The Times                    467,216 Today                        307,150 The Independent              302,502* *October-December SUNDAYS: News of the World          4,954,416 Sunday Mirror              3,045,502 Sunday People              2,982,771 Sunday Express             2,180,609 Mail on Sunday             1,601,038 Sunday Times               1,147,405 Observer                     769,290 Sunday Telegraph             686,163 Sunday Today                 231,277   Source: Independent Audit Bureau of Circulations, London</TEXT></DOC>
