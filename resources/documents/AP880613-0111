Riot police kicked and punched street vendors in Seoul and threwtear gas to disperse a march by about 1,000 of the merchants, newsreports said. The vendors accused authorities of hurting theirbusinesses in efforts to clean up the city for the Olympics.   Police and U.S. officials said students tossed three firebombsand two tear gas grenades at the U.S. Information Service buildingin Taegu before they were seized by police guards firing tear gas.   Police said only three students were involved in the attack inTaegu, 150 miles south of Seoul, but local press reports said therewere up to 10 attackers and that they also hurled two homemadebombs.   The reports said six windows were broken and the office's signwas set on fire.   The attack followed a wave of violent anti-government andanti-U.S. protests in the past two weeks by radical studentsdemanding an end to U.S. influence and the removal of about 42,000American troops stationed here under a mutual defense pact.   Few South Koreans support the radicals, who also are demandingreunification of South Korea and communist North Korea.   In the western port city of Inchon, about 3,000 universitystudents yelling ``Yankee go home!'' and anti-government sloganshurled firebombs and rocks when police fired barrages of tear gasto stop them from marching off their campus.   The Korean news agency Yonhap said about 1,200 students fromeight schools attacked riot police with firebombs and rocks at auniversity campus in the southern city of Pusan.   No injuries were reported in the campus clashes.   The protesters demanded that the government release studentsarrested Friday in major street clashes across the capital.   Those battles broke out when riot police blocked thousands ofstudents trying to march to the North Korean border for talks withnorthern students on reunifying North and South.   There was more violence Sunday when riot police clashed withthousands of students during a funeral march for a radical whocommitted suicide in an anti-government protest.   The students burned Olympic flags during the funeral march.Seoul is the host of the 1988 Summer Olympics, which begin Sept.17. The radicals back North Korea's demand to be a co-host of theGames.   Police said Monday that 600 of the 908 students arrested Fridayhad been freed and that 229 others were facing minor charges.   Police charged 47 students with assault or with violatingnational security laws.   ``Ensure our life!'' street vendors shouted as they marched inSeoul after a rally at Sungkyunkwan University.   News reports said at least five vendors were injured when policemoved in to disperse them. The reports said one vendor wasseriously hurt by a punch in the face.   The vendors shouted anti-government slogans and accusedauthorities of cracking down on their street stalls to keep thestreets clean as part of beautification and urban renewal projectsfor the Olympics.</TEXT></DOC>
