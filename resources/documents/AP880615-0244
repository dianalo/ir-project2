DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and top legislativeleaders announced an agreement Wednesday to close the state'scurrent $400 million budget gap, skirting a sensitive presidentialcampaign issue by avoiding new taxes.   Dukakis and the lawmakers failed to resolve the spending and taxquestions for the fast-approaching new fiscal year, however.   Dukakis, the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee,has been resisting calls from rival Jesse Jackson to include aplank in the party platform calling for higher taxes on the wealthy.   And any plan to increase taxes in Dukakis' home state wouldsurely be made into a campaign issue by the Republicans.   The solution to the immediate Massachusetts budget crunch workedout by the Democrats mainly involves government bookkeeping, withlittle impact on government programs and no new taxes or fees.   For fiscal 1989, which begins July 1, Dukakis and thelegislative leaders agreed on a target spending level of about$11.8 billion, or nearly $200 million less than the governororiginally proposed in January and about the same as approved bythe House in May.   To meet that goal, the government will need new revenues,officials acknowledged. There were indications that the extra fundscould come from higher corporate and personal taxes, as well as amodest increase in some fees.   ``We've not only solved this year's problem, but we've leftsubstantial fiscal flexibility for next year, even though thegovernor expects to sign a balancd budget in the next few weeks,''Finance Secretary Frank Keefe told reporters at a briefing afterthe closed-door meeting in Dukakis' office.   With the Senate about to begin debate on a spending plan for thenew year, Democrats are struggling to find ways to deal with arevenue forecast that has dropped by more than $200 million sinceApril.   The tax proposals under discussion for next year include a $40million sales tax on cigarettes, a $70 million increase incorporate taxes by closing ``loopholes'' and a similar amountthrough realigning the state and federal income tax codes.</TEXT></DOC>
