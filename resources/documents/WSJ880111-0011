EIP, a maker of microwave test equipment, said it cooperated fully with the government during its investigation. It called the charges &quot;technical in nature&quot; and said it will vigorously contest them. No company employees or directors were named as defendants.    The alleged violations include one count each of failure to obtain a valid export license, false statements and failure to file export documents. The three charges carry maximum fines totaling just more than $2 million.    The alleged violations involve two separate shipments of spare parts for microwave testing equipment, one in 1984 and one in 1985. One shipment to an undisclosed destination was valued at $2,300. The second shipment, valued at $12,017, went to Thailand.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, EIP shares closed at $6.75, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
