Two of the four were in the top echelon of the government, itreported.   The agency said agents thwarted the plotters' attempt to arrestCompaore upon his return from a trip to China late Monday.   Reached by telex from Abidjan, the agency quoted governmentspokesman Clement Ouedraogo as saying the coup leaders planned toseize the airport and if they met resistance, to shoot downCompaore's plane when it approached.   Ouedraogo spoke at a news conference Tuesday in Ouagadougou,capital of the impoverished Sahelian nation. The agency said BurkinaFaso was calm, and that no fighting has taken place.   Ouedraogo said Maj. Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lingani and Capt. HenriZongo, effectively the No. 2 and No. 3 men in Compaore's PopularFront military government, were executed along with two othermilitary plotters, not identified.   The agency quoted Ouedraogo as saying Capt. Gilbert Diendere, incharge of presidential security, discovered the scheme just beforeCompaore returned.   The executions mark the final breakup of a clique of youngofficers who came to power with Capt. Thomas Sankara in Aug. 4,1983. Zongo and Lingani, like Compaore close friends of Sankara,supported Compaore in his overthrow and killing of Sankara on Oct.15, 1987.   First word of the coup attempt came in a communique read on thegovernment-controlled radio. It said, ``Our people and revolution,and its militants at all levels, have just escaped, on the night ofSept. 18, 1989, a cowardly plot fomented by military and fascistelements led by some ambitious and anti-revolutionary people who areat the very top of the political leadership.''   It specifically named Lingani and Zongo and said their objectives``were to dissolve the Popular Front and all the politicalorganizations and to restore fascist authority.''   Burkina Faso, victim of recurring droughts in the past twodecades, has experienced six military coups since independence fromFrance in 1960. It is listed by the World Bank as one of the world'spoorest nations with personal income averaging $190 in 1987.   The West African nation has a population of about 6 million andcovers 105,870 square miles. More than 2 million Burkinabe have lefttheir country to seek work in Ivory Coast.</TEXT></DOC>
