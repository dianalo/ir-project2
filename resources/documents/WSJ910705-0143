Under the revision, NCR agreed to omit any furtherdividends to its shareholders before the merger. And thecompanies increased the transaction price by 74 cents a sharein ATandamp;T stock, or an additional $49.6 million, to reflectNCR's greater cash value as a result of the dividendomission.</LP><TEXT>   NCR's board has to approve the dividend omission. Bothboards have to approve the increase in the price.   ATandamp;T and NCR want to do an all-stock transaction thatwould be tax-free to NCR shareholders. ATandamp;T has said that ifit doesn't get permission from the Securities and ExchangeCommission to use the pooling-of-interests accountingtreatment, it would need to shift its $110-a-share, $7.48billion, offer to a 40% cash and 60% stock purchase.   That's because ATandamp;T would have to carry the goodwillgenerated from NCR's purchase on its books for years,affecting its reported earnings. Goodwill is the amount bywhich the purchase price exceeds the book value of theacquired company.   Apparently, NCR's special $1-a-share dividend paymentsmade earlier in the year are holding up the SEC's approval.SEC accounting rules don't allow companies that are mergingto pool interests if they've departed from their normaldividend policy or altered their equity structure eitherthrough a special dividend or some other means before amerger.   Wednesday's announcement was an attempt by ATandamp;T to clarifya vague statement issued Monday in which it said it believedit could use pooling based on &quot;discussions with the SEC, NCRand ATandamp;T advisers.&quot;   &quot;We really felt it was premature to discuss our plannedactions prior to the boards' approval,&quot; an ATandamp;T spokeswomansaid, explaining the reasons for Monday's statement and thefollow-up announcement. But &quot;there were continuing questionsfrom the financial community about our plans.&quot;   To address the pooling issue, NCR in the original mergerpact agreed to issue and sell about 6.7 million shares of NCRstock to undo repurchases NCR made of its stock over the lasttwo years -- something which is also restricted under SECpooling guidelines. ATandamp;T and NCR expect to sell these sharesin an underwritten public offering following NCR shareholderapproval of the merger and before conclusion of the merger.All these shares will be automatically converted into ATandamp;Tstock in the same manner as all other NCR shares.   ATandamp;T and NCR said other minor pooling issues are in theprocess of being resolved. &quot;These are minor but until they'reresolved we think it would be premature to discuss them,&quot; thespokeswoman said.   The merger agreement, announced May 6, calls for ATandamp;T topay each NCR shareholder $110 in ATandamp;T stock per NCR share.The exact number of ATandamp;T shares to be swapped will be basedon the average ATandamp;T closing stock price during the 20 tradingdays up to the fifth trading day before the special NCRshareholder meeting to vote on the merger. The average stockprice to be used in the calculation will not be more than$40.625 or less than $34.125.   This means that if ATandamp;T's stock price is at or below$34.125 ATandamp;T must pay out 3.22 shares for each NCR share or2.708 shares if ATandamp;T's price is at or above $40.625. Theadditional 74 cents in ATandamp;T stock will be paid using the sameaverage price calculation but will not be subject to anyupper or lower limits.   NCR is awaiting clearance by the SEC of its proxy materialfor a special meeting to vote on the merger. Both companiesexpect the meeting to occur in the fall.</TEXT></DOC>
