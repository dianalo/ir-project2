The m.o. of most city gardeners is M.O., but even if I weren't urban, I'd still be mail-order. The catalog lit is unfailingly entertaining. I'm especially partial to those Midwestern pulp 'logs that keep their constant readers breathless by punctuation: &quot;Plants Not Seeds! SWEET CHOCOLATE PEPPER: Eat It Like Candy!&quot; &quot;SENSITIVE PLANT: This Plant Has Feelings!&quot;    Mail-order, easy-chair gardening is timesaving, too, except when it gets epistolary. M.O. gardening -- plants not seeds -- can be a bit problematic. When you send off for &quot;live plant material&quot; and the material arrives unalive, you may spend almost as much time with the typewriter that season as you do with the trowel.    I started my doleful career as a garden &quot;correspondent&quot; in 1984, in retaliation against an Illinois nursery. I had succumbed to its drugstore-style blandishments -- &quot;one cent Sale on Shrubs and Trees: Buy One at Regular Low Price . . . Get Another For Only one cent!&quot; -- despite the semilurid tabloid format, the obvious horti-hype and the excessive exclamation.    I suppose I should have expected what I got. My comeuppance began on June 26, 1984, with my first epistle to Illinois: &quot;UPS delivered my plants this morning . . . and I was shocked at the terrible condition (dead) of most of them. This is the first time I have ordered from {you} and quite possibly, the last. I do not understand why an order sent you May 2nd was not fulfilled until the end of June -- by which time I'm sure even plants in Illinois have long since burst out of dormancy.    &quot;By the time this bedraggled and rotting shipment arrived, the Northeast had already experienced a week of heat wave, temperatures around 100 degrees, certainly the worst sort of weather for shipping or planting.&quot;    By spring 1987, I had forgot my prior experience, and besides, this nursery's 1987 tablog, thick and gaudy as ever, had &quot;SATISFACTION GUARANTEED&quot; plastered all over it. And why was SATISFACTION GUARANTEED? Well, the plants were &quot;not only top quality, they are handled in a superior way . . . unlike plants that are allowed to dehydrate daily in warm, humidity-starved rooms, {our} plants are shipped to you in peak condition, fresh from the cooler, with a maximum amount of humidity stored within each cell for guaranteed planting results.&quot; Cellular satisfaction! I bit. I bought.    Shipped to my front stoop this time: just barely cut and stuck twiglets of the purported plants -- dead, dried and upon autopsy, almost totally innocent of roots. I began the correspondence anew, expecting to be handled &quot;in a superior way.&quot; On June 24, 1987, I took to my typing machine. &quot;Re my plant order of 16 April 1987. The plants took seven weeks to get here . . . more than half of them arriving dead. . . . I regret to report that the two philadelphus, the two butterfly bushes and one of the three paperwhite birch remain dead, and my original diagnosis of dead on arrival was correct. Since I am interested in planting a garden, not a cemetery, I would very much appreciate being sent lively, healthy replacements of the above-mentioned plants. . . . I find it very upsetting to receive clinically dead plants.&quot;    Naively, I had thought a live letter would generate a live response. Instead, by way of answer I was sent a &quot;Dear Customer&quot; form -- not even a first-name -- familiar computer-generated form -- requesting return of the &quot;SHIPPING LABEL&quot; (long since discarded) and sneering &quot;since you cannot comply with the terms of our guarantee we do not feel we have any further obligation in this matter.&quot; I felt they did, in letter No. 2, dispatched July 7, 1987. &quot;I'm not sure if all this was sent back to me because you are questioning my honesty? If that's the case, I guess I'll have to mail the dead birches, mock oranges and butterfly bushes back to you as proof of death? I assure you, taking the time to write you about these problems is probably a lot more trouble than it's worth -- and I would not do so if some real problems, dead plants, did not exist. It is time better spent cultivating my garden.&quot;    That crotchety piece of plant prose got no answer at all, so on Aug. 16, 1987, I sent my third epistle to the nurseryman. &quot;This everlasting correspondence is getting tiresome, and would not have been necessary if I had, indeed, been sent 'TOP QUALITY ITEMS.' I do not neglect my garden and I did not neglect the above-mentioned plants -- they were DOA and even with Miracle-Gro I cannot work miracles on dead plants. As I have said to you before, I am interested in planting a garden, not a cemetery, but at this point I have about given up hope of receiving any sort of satisfaction from {you} for my April 1987 order of mostly moribund plants. I must say that the way I have been treated re these dead plants . . . does not exactly dispose me to do any future business with {you}.&quot;    At the end of September, exactly three months after writing letter No. 1 of the '87 growing season, replacement plants arrived -- identical to the ones shipped in June -- dead, again, at the cellular level. In the meantime, though, I had contacted MAN (Mailorder Association of Nurserymen, Box 400, Roachdale, Ind. 46172), since the nurseryman I'd been addressing was a member. MAN described itself as &quot;a unique, friendly group. Members share their knowledge and promote just and equitable principles of business in the industry.&quot; MAN even has a code of ethics. &quot;Members should make their offers clear and honest . . . Members should not use exaggerated, fictitious price comparisons; nonexistent discounts or savings . . . All inquiries, all complaints, all correspondence should be answered as soon as possible.&quot; MAN's NEWSLETTER reprinted a speech delivered at the January 1987 MAN meeting in Chicago, &quot;CATALOG CREATIVE 101,&quot; in which an advertising copywriter recommended that MANmen &quot;try to use words your customer can readily relate to. So instead of using the official horticultural colors, go for fashion hues, decorator colors. . . . Really let go and get wildly enthusiastic, even go way overboard. You can always tone down excessive copy later. . . . Institutional copy helps to build confidence in your company . . . read chatty letters from customers.&quot;    But by then the fashion hues had faded from my perennial borders. I was into deadheading, and not up to writing another chatty letter to Illinois requesting live replacements for the dead replacements. Instead, I would continue reading this nurseryman's wildly enthusiastic tablogs for FUN only -- and elsewise cut him out of my M.O. loop. </TEXT></DOC>
