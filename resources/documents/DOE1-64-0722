Inaddition, the use of recombinant DNA technology is explained throughoutthe volume. Specific topics examined include: the versatility of proteolyticenzymes, the intricate proteolytic control mechanisms in hemostasis andtheir application to thrombolytic therapy, the evolution of proteolyticenzymes, and the role of limited proteolytic processing in several biologicalcontrol processes.</TEXT></DOC>
