Whether our government ispro-life or pro-choice should not be relevant when it comesto providing women with broad access to medical care. I'malso distressed that Justice Rehnquist shrugged off theobvious economic discrimination this ruling perpetuates. Howcan our government, in good conscience, say to women that,unless you can pay for it yourself, you have no right toreceive information or counseling about abortion?   Very few women don't know about abortion. Those who knowand who feel it's a necessary alternative to bringing anunwanted, unloved and unprovided -- for child into the worldwill seek it out regardless of whether they get assistancefrom a federally funded clinic. Unfortunately, as aconsequence of the high court's ruling, too many of thesewomen will probably suffer from self-induced or &quot;back-alley&quot;abortions. I fail to see what is &quot;pro-life&quot; about lettingwomen suffer for lack of proper medical information andadvisement. Unless Congress enacts legislation to overrulethe ruling, the lives of these women are in our government'shands.</LP><TEXT>   Marie Bailey   Tallahassee, Fla.   ---   Whether one is pro-life or pro-abortion, is it not ratherludicrous that our Supreme Court, which has only one womanmember, should be entrusted with a final legislative decisionaffecting only the female sex of our nation?   In view of the male dominance of our highest court,perhaps the judges should have had to assist, several times,a juvenile court in Washington or in their home states to seefirsthand the reality of what happens when women give birthto children they cannot afford and do not want. To ban anyform of medical counseling to females, by a basically malejudiciary system, is discriminatory.   Kathryn Rettew Bregman   Pinehurst, N.C.</TEXT></DOC>
