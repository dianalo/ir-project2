<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-0776 </DOCNO><TEXT>Although nuclear criticality safety analysis are commonly performed bya Monte Carlo computer code such as KENO, one-dimensional determinatemethods still play an important role. These methods are useful for rapidsurveys, for detecting errors in Monte Carlo results by analyzing simplifiedconfigurations, and for analyzing configurations that are essentiallysimple. The usefulness of these methods is greatly enhanced where separabilityof the neutron flux into axial and radial components, for example, isa good approximation. With two-group diffusion theory this procedureis straight-forward. Application to transport theory in an S/sub n/ codesuch as ANISN is more complicated. As a test of the procedure outlinedhere, a number of calculations were performed for a set of water-reflectedcylinders of 400-g {sup 233}U/l solution calculated to be critical byTWO-TRAN with two-group cross sections derived from ENDF/B-IV. Resultsare given and show the procedure to be a good approximation. Care mustbe taken, however, in incorporating this procedure into an S/sub n/ code.Replacing diffusion constants in aluminum with constants calculated bySLICE gives significant improvement.</TEXT></DOC>
