Michael has reason to be satisfied: In the two years since thebreakup of his Wham! partnership with Andrew Ridgely, Michael hashad five No. 1 singles.   ``Faith'' itself spawned four consecutive No. 1 singles,including the title track from the solo album.   In an interview published in Friday's Los Angeles HeraldExaminer, Michael said he has no problem being identified as a popsinger, because he respects that end of the music spectrum. Hedefended Wham!, a collaboration that resulted in 38 million inrecord sales, as serious work.   ``I don't think there was anything particularly lightweightabout `Careless Whisper' or `A Different Corner,''' he said. ``Theonly thing that was lightweight was the way people perceived theimage.   ``Mine is still very much a pop image. It's just that I believemore in pop music than most artists do. And I don't think you couldcall `Faith' anything other than a pop album. It's very diverse,but I think it's just an accomplished pop album.''</TEXT><DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md.

After the program Thursday, Haley said blacks can use knowledgeof their heritage to build pride, but their history of enslavementhas another side that keeps many blacks from fulfilling theirpotential.   ``There are literally millions of black young people who areinadequately prepared _ educationally, psychologically orotherwise,'' he said. ``What we are seeing in this country ispaying the price for attitudes prior to now.''</TEXT><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Singer Linzi Hateley, who won praise in the flopBroadway musical ``Carrie,'' will make her West End debut Oct. 26in the long-running London hit ``Les Miserables.''   ``There is that bit of security, which obviously I lacked with`Carrie,''' said Hateley, who starts rehearsals Monday for themusical adaptation that begins its third year here in December.
