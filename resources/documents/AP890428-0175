It was the heaviest day of fighting inPeru's nine-year insurgency.   Six soldiers and three university students also were killed,officials said.   Also Friday, the officials said more than 6,000 people weredetained in Lima in massive sweeps by police seeking the killers ofleftist congressman Eriberto Arroyo, who was slain Thursday.   At dawn, troops spotted a column of leftist guerrillas inuniforms near Molinos, a tiny village 35 miles north of Huancayo,the government said in a communique.   In fighting that followed, 62 leftist guerrillas and sixsoldiers were killed and 23 soldiers were wounded, it said.   President Alan Garcia said in a brief radio statement that therebels were from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, whichendorses a Cuba styled Marxism and has been active since 1984.   Police also killed 15 Maoist Shining Path guerrillas in fightingnear Santa Rosa, a village in Peru's cocaine-producing jungle 260miles northeast of Lima.   The government said drug traffickers supported the rebels in theclash, but it did not provide further details.   The casualties Friday marked the highest number of guerrilladeaths in any single day of fighting during the nine-yearinsurgency. Thirty-four Shining Path guerrillas died earlier thismonth in two battles with troops in the Amazon jungle.   More than 900 people have died this year in political violence.   In related violence, police said the bodies of three studentsshot to death Friday by Shining Path guerrillas were found at theUniversity of Huancayo.   The region around Huancayo, one of Peru's richest agriculturalzones 140 miles east of Lima, has been a growing focus of rebelactivity for the past three years.   Both the Mao-inspired Shining Path and the smaller Tupac AmaruRevolutionary Movement are active in the region. The groups are notlinked.   Analysts said the guerrillas are seeking to disrupt farming andisolate the zone to prevent food from reaching coastal Lima,further agravating an severe economic recession that has alreadysparked temporary food shortages.   Police said 6,407 people were arrested and 1,135 automobileswere stopped and searched on city streets late Thursday as policesought the killers of Arroyo, a member of the United Left Party,the second strongest party in Congress.   Police have blamed the Shining Path for the killing, but somemembers of the United Left, a Marxist coalition, blamed the murderon on anti-rebel death squad called the Rodrigo Franco Command.   During previous sweeps, the vast majority of those detained havebeen released after proving their identities.   Analysts said the spreading violence, coupled with Peru'sdeepest economic recession of the century, has fomented politicalinstability and social chaos that have become a threat to Peru'sdemocracy.   The Shining Path has been fighting since 1980 to topple thegovernment.   The violence has claimed more than 14,000 lives, includingsoldiers, police, guerrillas and non-combantants. But most of thedead have been highland peasants caught in the cross-fire betweengovernment forces and guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
