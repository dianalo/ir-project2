But with it all, President Bush appeared on Tuesday to behandcuffed in his struggle to free the American hostages.   Two weeks of veiled threats interspersed with indirect offers toresume normal relations with Tehran have not produced tangibleresults. And Bush, responding with evident discomfort to toughquestions at a White House news conference, could neither reportevidence of progress in his multi-layered campaign nor offer apromising new approach.   ``We're going to keep on trying,'' was about all he could musterin the way of a response. ``There's a lot of lines out there, a lotof initiatives have been taken.''   And yet, Bush was forced to acknowledge that efforts so farfailed to permit him to provide a ``positive assessment at thispoint.''   His predicament is not unique. President Jimmy Carter tried asimilar range of tactics, and a dramatic helicopter rescue operationthat fell apart in a disabling windstorm in the Iranian desert. Andyet he was unable to liberate the Americans held hostage in Tehranfor 444 days.   They emerged on his last day in office, Ronald Reagan'sInauguration Day in 1980.   As for Reagan, despite his muscular campaign rhetoric, only asurreptitious transfer of U.S. weapons to Iran _ which caused anuproar when it became public _ seemed to liberate three Americans.And others were seized subsequently.   Bush, rounding out his seventh month in the White House, mighttake some comfort in his predecessors' frustrations. But he, too,has been unable to dent the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which abductedand apparently killed Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.   The factions believed to be holding eight other Americans inLebanon present an elusive and perhaps impossible target. They aremingled in with innocent civilians in slums and camps, andapparently move the hostages around and about in a crazy-quiltpattern that defies American surveillance.   ``If I could find some action _ diplomatic, military, privatesector, public sector _ that I thought would help get the hostagesout or guard against future hostage taking, I would take suchaction,'' Bush said.   But on the military front, at least, the leader of the world'smost powerful nation seems paralyzed.   ``I'd like to know that what action we took was not going tovictimize a lot of innocent people,'' Bush said. ``When you look atthe action that the United States can take, I don't want to beresponsible for the loss of innocent life.''   Besides, Bush must weigh the safety of the hostages themselvesand the lives of the Americans sent on a long-shot rescue mission.   On the diplomatic front, his appeal to the Soviet Union, the Arabworld and other friendly or neutral countries has at least gainedtheir sympathetic support. But as with Bush's public signal to Iranlast Wednesday that ``goodwill begets goodwill,'' there is noresponse from Tehran that portends freeing of the hostages.   Iran's religious leader issued a flat rejection Monday of Bush'sgoodwill gestures and White House hints that direct talks could bein the offing.   ``Next to Israel, the usurper regime ruling over occupiedPalestine, you are the most cursed government in the eyes of theIranian people,'' the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in slamming thatdoor shut. ``No one in the Islamic Republic will hold talks withyou.''   That leaves the legal front.   Lawyers at the Justice Department have been looking atanti-terrorist laws to see if a case can be built for extraditingSheik Abdul Karim Obeid, the Israeli-held Moslem cleric said by someto have played a role in Higgins' abduction.   Presumably, that might touch off a chain of events leading to aswap for the hostages, as Israel has proposed.   But Bush was very cool to the idea.   If there is an indictment, he said, ``I would be remiss if Ididn't try to see him brought to trial.''   Well, a reporter pressed, could the president take the lead andencourage the Justice Department to proceed?   ``I've put it just exactly the way I want to put it,'' Bush saidwith a touch of irritation and frustration.   On Wednesday, with the hostage crisis _ his first real foreignpolicy problem _ hanging over him, Bush embarks on a 20-dayvacation. Obviously, he would like to have a solution, or at leastbe on the verge of one.   ``If I could find a way to take those hostages, get them andbring them out, and that required using the military force of theUnited States, make no mistake about it, I would do it in aninstant,'' Bush said.   But he left the White House podium with every indication that isnot about to happen.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Schweid heads the AP's State Departmentstaff.</TEXT></DOC>
