Spend as little money as possible and let as many people aspossible try to find as many cures as possible.   This is impossible.   As proof, we have seen the federal government slash $25 billionfrom housing programs since 1981 while cities and states conducthalf-hearted, uncoordinated and underfinanced efforts to combat thehomeless problem.   Nothing has worked, because the number of homeless is growing 20to 40 percent each year.   The main federal program, the Stewart McKinney HomelessAssistance Act, empowers the government to spend up to $3 billionover five years for programs for the homeless. Yet, since thelegislation was enacted in 1987, Congress has only provided $1.1billion in funding.   What's the deal?   State and local governments, which are left in a precariousposition scrambling to fill the funding gaps, are reluctant to domuch, hoping that the federal government will step back in and takecharge.   No such luck.   We see homelessness as a national problem, something that must becoordinated properly from the top. Allocating a few bucks andconsidering the matter resolved doesn't cut it.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 19   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on the importance of the U.S.Constitution:   Most of the nation's self-proclaimed patriots must have been tooconsumed with wrapping themselves in the flag or with hand-wringingover proposed flag-burning legislation to have noticed the 202ndanniversary of the signing of U.S. Constitution Sunday.   That's too bad because it is our Constitution, more than ourflag, that is really the premier icon of U.S. freedom and governance.   We celebrate with great gusto, as we should, our Declaration ofIndependence and, to a lesser degree, Flag Day. But it is ourprecious Constitution _ the oldest written constitution continuouslyin force _ that we should especially celebrate and respect. Morethan a symbol to ourselves and the rest of the world, this documentis a specific declaration of who we are and what we stand for.   Sadly, while many Americans claim pride in our Constitution,survey after survey reveals appalling public ignorance about what itsays and means.   Perhaps our nation should spend less time arguing about the flagand spend more time reading or rereading this four-page 5,000-worddocument that gives our flag meat and meaning. Why not turn off thetube and start tonight.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 16   The Seattle Times on the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut:   Thirty years of U.S. diplomatic presence in Lebanon ended thismonth with the evacuation of the American Embassy in Beirut.   For Beirut, the epicenter of sectarian violence, the chaos of1989 is just another moment in 3,500 years of destruction at thehands of religious enemies and foreign invaders. ...   Since 1975, Beirut has been self-destructing in bloody fits andstarts of civil war and sectarian vengeance. Christan and Moslemforces are now locked in a final frenzy of destruction. The battlesare over the corpse of a once celebrated center of trade, learningand cosmopolitan sophistication.   Beirut's demise affirms an eternal verity: Religion andgovernment do not mix. Intolerance poisons secular affairs. ...   U.S. presidents and their diplomatic envoys hardly cut and ranfrom Lebanon. They endured bombings, assassinations, hostages, andvicious shellings. But the hatreds were too old and toomisunderstood for Uncle Sam to prevail.   Beirut is dead, but it may flourish again. Renewal, likedestruction, is part of the city's history.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 19   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on the Alaska oil spill:   So what do we learn from this disaster?   Primarily, that prevention is a lot better than attempted cure.Once the oil is out of the tanker, it's too late. Quick response tothe accident _ totally lacking in Prince William Sound _ would havehelped, but even that isn't a sure thing. A smaller oil spill offRhode Island a month later wasn't successfully contained despitequick response because rough seas broke up the oil.   Yet prevention is receiving relatively little attention. Congressis spending more time haggling over the liability for future spillsthan on keeping them from happening.   Common sense solutions to make another Exxon Valdez less likelyhave been getting short shrift.   Two are particularly important:   _ A requirement that all oil tankers built for U.S. service havedouble hulls. A double hull probably would have prevented seriousleakage from the Exxon Valdez, despite the extent of the damage itsustained. Existing single-hulled tankers should be phased out.   _ Much stricter licensing standards for tanker crews should beadopted. Inexperience and inattention played a huge part in theExxon Valdez grounding. Most of the time, tanker operations areroutine _ but in an emergency every second counts. Crews should havethe expertise necessary to help protect against the huge risks ofanother spill.   It's fine to debate the merits of the Prince William Soundcleanup. But it's much more important to keep such an accident fromhappening again.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
