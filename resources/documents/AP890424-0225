The development, which is attributed in part to South Africa'seagerness for international trade, has infuriated localconservationists, who say it tarnishes the nation's reputation as aleader in wildlife preservation.   They have urged the government to tighten customs inspections,intensify police investigations and stiffen penalties.   ``Until this can be achieved, South African conservationistsmust hang their heads in shame,'' wrote John Ledger, director ofthe Endangered Wildlife Trust, in a recent magazine editorial. ``Wehave been blind to the criminals in our midst.''   Ledger and his colleagues say South Africans and foreignerscollaborate in operating vast international smuggling rings. Theyare among the paymasters of poachers who, in the past two decades,have played the main role in cutting Africa's rhino population fromabout 70,000 to 4,000 and the elephant population from 1.3 millionto about 450,000.   The toll of elephants has prompted many countries to closelycontrol the trade in ivory.   Typically, ivory and rhino horns are smuggled into South Africaby truck from countries such as Zambia, Zaire, Angola orMozambique. Experts say the contraband usually is flown to the FarEast, where the biggest markets are.   Rhino horn is sold in powdered form in the Far East and othercountries as an aphrodisiac.   Many Far Eastern countries have increased trade with SouthAfrica over the past few years as Western nations imposed tradesanctions to protest its apartheid policies.   Esmond Bradley-Martin, a Kenyan-based expert on the illegaltrade in rhino horns, says the biggest demand for rhino products isin Taiwan, which has close economic and political ties with SouthAfrica.   Encouraged by the government, Taiwanese businessmen haveestablished scores of factories in South Africa in recent years,and hundreds of Taiwanese have moved here.   ``Thus, the perfect opportunity has been provided for Chinesebusinessmen to purchase rhino horn and hide from illegal SouthAfrican dealers and take these supplies from Jan Smuts airport inJohannesburg to Taipei,'' Bradley-Martin wrote last year.   Ledger said customs workers at Jan Smuts lack the resources toinvestigate all outgoing cargo, especially shipments that appear tohave proper permits.   At highway border posts, he said, customs officials checkingincoming goods from neighboring states search more intensively forweapons and explosives than for elephant tusks or rhino horns.   Also, in a bid to encourage regional trade, South Africa has acustoms agreement with several of its neighbors and this means manyvehicles enter without thorough searches. Some containers passthrough South Africa without ever being inspected.   ``We've developed a good network of trading because of ourpolitical isolation,'' said Clive Walker, a prominent Johannesburgconservationist. ``We've been used by smugglers who have found aconvenient way of doing business with a good degree of safety.''   Ledger said the problem lies with light penalties for smugglers,who face no more than a 2,000-rand ($800) fine if found inpossession of contraband rhino horns.   ``It's an easy option for a crook,'' he said in an interview.``The penalties are a fraction of what they'd be for drugsmugglers.''   Parliament is considering legislation that would increase themaximum penalty to a 100,000-rand ($40,000) fine or 15 years inprison.   In a recent documentary, the state-run South AfricanBroadcasting Corp. said 50 tons of ivory was exported from SouthAfrica last year, accompanied by seemingly proper permits. However,the broadcast said only 14 tons could be accounted for officially _seven tons legally brought into South Africa and seven tons culledfrom elephants killed in a population-control program at KrugerNational Park.   A U.S. environmental group, the Conservation, Environmental andAnimal Welfare Consortium, alleged last year that the South Africanmilitary had helped organize an ivory smuggling racket intended toprovide funds for anti-Marxist guerrillas in Angola and Mozambique.   A South African board of inquiry rejected charges of large-scalemilitary involvement, although it said the army did help Angolarebels transport elephant tusks in 1978-79.   Two South African army officers were among six people indictedlast year in Connecticut on charges that they smuggled rhino horns,skins of other endangered animals and AK-47 rifles into the UnitedStates.   Ledger wants to declare war on all ivory and horn smugglers.   ``While we have proudly extolled to the world the righteousnessof South Africa's conservation achievements, these evil people havedestroyed our reputation and our pride,'' he wrote in theeditorial. ``They have to be stopped.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs May 3</NOTE></DOC>
