The 12-year-old was earning $4 to $5 an hour doing menial labor,said Thomas P. Fischer, head of the Immigration and NaturalizationService office in Atlanta.   Working conditions for three Mexican boys, including the12-year-old and two 15-year-olds, ``almost bordered on bondage whenyou look at the age of these people,'' Fischer said. ``They werebeing paid in cash; there was no documentation.''   The boys were among 85 illegal aliens from Mexico and Peru foundworking at the Piedmont Quilting Corp. in Walhalla, S.C., during aJuly 17 raid, Fischer said.   The administrative fine is the largest imposed by INS under a1986 law that bars employers from hiring illegal aliens. It wasannounced a day after the company, its owners and nine managerswere indicted on charges of illegally recruiting and harboring 117illegal aliens.   The criminal indictment, returned Tuesday in Greenville, S.C.,was based on evidence that the company had employed 32 illegalaliens in addition to those found during the raid, Fischer said.   Plant owner Alfred Mizhir, 55, and his wife, Gail Mizhir, 30,both of Spring Lake, N.J., face possible prison terms of 653 yearsand fines totaling $5.1 million if convicted on all charges.   The nine other indicted company managers or officers also eachface up to 653 years in prison if convicted.   The criminal charges resulted from a six-month investigation,which included the use of an undercover INS agent who posed as aplant worker, Fischer said.   Fischer said working conditions were unsafe for children who``are not mature enough to understand the danger'' posed by largemachinery and 150-pound bales of fabric used to make pillows,quilts and comforters.   ``If something goes wrong, do you think that a 12-year-old isgoing to complain or quit? He is going to shut his mouth,'' Fischersaid.   The company refused to comment on the charges or the civil fine,which it has 30 days to contest.   ``There is no comment,'' said a woman who answered the telephoneat the factory. She refused to identify herself.   The administrative fine also covers the company's failure tocomply with procedures to verify that more than 400 employees werenot illegal aliens, Fischer said.</TEXT></DOC>
