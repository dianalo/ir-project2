District Judge Royce Lamberth issued the temporary order that was sought by two car-haul drivers, who are members of Local 299 in Detroit. The two Teamster members, William Carothers and Dennis Wade, charged in their suit that a fast mailing is designed to ram through the contract before car-haul members have a chance to study it and hear any criticism of it from others.    The two members said many locals have already held meetings to discuss the new agreement and others wouldn't have time to schedule such meetings before their members vote, because ballots were to be mailed today. The new pact eliminated a pay concession contained in a contract that members rejected in July, but other provisions might still be inadequate, dissident Teamsters said.    Teamsters officials couldn't be reached for comment on the court order. </TEXT></DOC>
