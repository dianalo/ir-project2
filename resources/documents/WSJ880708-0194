Future AIDS patients deserve the most effective drugs, and determination of relative drug efficacy must begin now. Why condemn 1.5 million future AIDS patients to second-best treatment, or worse, due to a lack of well-controlled, double-blind studies? How else are we going to determine if an AIDS drug works?    Those currently suffering with AIDS represent only the tip of the iceberg of all those people currently infected, and to abandon stringent efficacy standards is an extremely shortsighted solution to a rapidly escalating problem. Flooding the market with drugs lacking efficacy data only ensures that many more AIDS patients in the future will die.    If, as the Journal suggests, we suspend the drug-approval requirements of the Kefauver Amendment for AIDS drugs, AIDS victims may be swamped with safe, but ineffective, drugs and the market will be open to &quot;fast-buck artists&quot; promoting innocuous but worthless substances as &quot;treatments.&quot;    Edward G. Remmers   Associate Director   Eric S. Berger M.D.    Medical Director   American Council on Science and Health   New York   ---   George Melloan's column on insurers and the AIDS epidemic was a thoughtful presentation on this controversial subject (Business World, May 31). However, I do take exception to the quotation of Ian Rolland indicating that individual testing for AIDS or any other serious disability is not necessary for group insurance.    Mr. Rolland is correct with respect to group insurance written on very large employers since adverse experience in any year due to an abnormal incidence of claims from AIDS or other serious illnesses usually can be recovered by pricing changes in later years. Over time, group rates charged to any large employer will be solely dependent on the claim experience of its employees and adverse fluctuations in claim costs can be spread over the employee population.    The case is quite different for a very small group, however. The cost of a single catastrophic claim in a group case with a small number of employees cannot be spread over the entire group in future years without unreasonable premium increases for the group. Unlike the situation with large employers, the insurer assumes a real risk with regard to providing group insurance to small employers because the cost of any adverse experience cannot reasonably be passed along to the specific case suffering the experience. The prospect of anti-selection in small cases is real and adds to that risk. It does not matter whether the anti-selection risk is due to diabetes, cancer, heart disease or AIDS. For this reason, insurers of small groups do typically seek information about the health status of employees before agreeing to provide coverage. At a time when there is so much discussion about the 37 million uninsured, so many of whom work for small employers, it is important to remember this significant difference between small and large groups.    One problem common to both small and large group cases is the risk of anti-selection from late entrants. These are individuals who decline coverage when they are first eligible for group insurance with their employers but who later request coverage due to a change in circumstances. Group insurers have a legitimate concern that the motivation for seeking coverage may be an adverse change in health and, as a result, routinely request health information on all late entrants prior to agreeing to provide coverage. This information may include a physical examination and any other testing deemed necessary.    John Gummere   Chairman and CEO   Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co.
