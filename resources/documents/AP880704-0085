Daniel Quayle, R-Ind., who sought thestudy.   Ballistic missiles are weapons that leave the earth's atmosphereand then fall back. They have longer ranges and capability to carrya much larger warhead than short-range missiles like the one thatfelled the Iranian airliner.   ``Clearly, these pose a threat to U.S. and allied peace keepingefforts in the Persian Gulf, the Middle East, and the Far East,''said Quayle.   The study did not address the problem of short-range missiles,which have also been proliferating, particularly in the Mideast. Itwas a short-range Standard missile that was used by the Navy toshoot down the Iranian Airbus early Sunday.   The study noted that China has been aggressively exporting itsmissile technology, particularly in the Middle East.   Until recently, most nations in the area didn't have ballisticmissiles. Israel already has in its arsenal the Jericho I andJericho II, two medium-range weapons.   But, the study noted, Saudi Arabia has agreed to purchaseChinese ``East Wind'' missiles, a weapon with a 2,700-kilometerrange that could be an eventual threat to Israel. The deal was keptfrom U.S. intelligence agencies for two years, until the weaponswere installed.   A number of other countries in the region are also joining theballistic missile club, the CRS said. It cited Egypt, which isdeveloping the 800-kilometer range Condor II missile in conjunctionwith Brazil, and is also acquiring the modified SCUD-B, aSoviet-developed missile also used by Iraq and North Korea. Egyptsaid the Condor II is needed to offset the Israeli Jericho.   A version of the SCUD is also being used by Iran, the studysaid. Both Iran and Iraq have fired SCUDS at each other's capitalsin the ``war of the cities'' that is part of the 8-year-oldIran-Iraq war.   In addition, both nations have the Chinese-built Silkwormmissiles, which have a large warhead but which are not particularlyaccurate.   Libya is also trying to develop missiles, according to thestudy. The regime of Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy has offeredBrazil $2 billion to help develop a whole new family of short- andmedium-range ballistic missiles and has also tried to buy theweapons from China. In addition, Libyans are working on ahome-grown missile with a 500-kilometer range. A test facility hasbeen built in the desert near Tauwiwa, the CRS said.   Syria also may be near having a ballistic missile, the studysaid. The Syrians reportedly are trying to buy China's M-9, a600-kilometer weapon that would hit most points in Israel. The M-9is being tested by the Chinese and the deal is not yet final, thestudy said.   In Latin America, Argentina and Brazil have both taken steps toupgrade their missile arsenals in the past year, the CRS said.   Brazil, besides discussing the development deal with Libya, isworking on yet another variant of the SCUD-B, which would have a300-mile range, and is also working on the Sonda IV. That missilewould give the Brazilians the capability to launch their own spacesatellites by 1990, the study said.   Argentina is working on the Condor II with the Eygptians andalso dealing with the Chinese on a joint version of a1,500-kilometer range weapon.   The Condor II would have enough range to reach the FalklandIslands, where there has been a large contingent of British troopsever since the 1982 war between the two nations over the remoteterritory. Argentina claims the islands, which it calls theMalvinas.   The CRS review also noted that Pakistan and India, two long-timeenemies, have escalated their competition in the ballistic missilearena. The two nations have fought three wars since the countrieswere created by the 1947 partitioning of the British colony.   India has successfully tested a 250-kilometer missile, thePrithvi, which is the country's first ballistic missile designedsolely for the military. In addition, the Indians are nearingcompletion of an advanced space launch missile that would have anintercontinental range.   Pakistan recently tested a missile with a range of up to 1,000kilometers and the capability to carry a nuclear warhead, the studysaid. Pakistan has denied that it is building atomic weapons, butnuclear non-proliferation officials say the country is developing anuclear capability.</TEXT></DOC>
