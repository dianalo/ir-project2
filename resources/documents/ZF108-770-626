Short Jr., ISC commander, was asked tojustify ISC's existence in the wake of calls for the elimination ofheadquarters-type operations wherever possible within the Defense Department.andM;Short will brief Department of Army officials in response to a study thatrecommended scrapping ISC if the commander could not prove its continuedexistence would save memory, officials said.andP;  The study is commonly referredto as Vanguard, sources said.andM;&quot;The supposition is that be doesn't have any chance to prove that somethingis cheaper than nothing,&quot; one official said last week.andM;ISC is located at Fort Huachuca in Arizona but was targeted under last year'sDOD base realignment plan for a move in 1997 to Fort Devens, Mass.andM;But the Army launched Vanguard earlier this year after the Bushadministration's Defense Management Report (DMR) called for slicing $39billion from the DOD budget over five years through management improvementsand consolidations.andM;Since the DMR report was issued, Pentagon cost-cutters have been tough onsenior officials and headquarters operations.andM;Defense Secretary Richard Cheney last month cut in half the number of generaland flag officers assigned to his own office, from 27 to 14.andP;  In June, Cheneyordered that 78 such officers be cut from the military in the next fouryears.andM;According to an Army document, ISC is &quot;the major Army command responsible forworldwide information management and transfer systems....andP;  The command is theprimary information systems hardware and software development and acquisitionactivity for the Army.&quot;andM;Short and his staff direct the activities of about 40,000 military andcivilian personnel located in the United States and 12 foreign countries.andO;The command was formed in 1984 when the Army decided to centralizeinformation-related activities lodged in other major commands, according toWren Timberlake, an ISC spokesman.andM;Speaking from Fort Huachuca, Timberlake said Short has made several formalresponses to the Vanguard study recently in Washington.andP;  Today's appearancebefore the Army's vice chief of staff, Timberlake said, probably would be hislast such briefing.andM;Timberlake said ISC officials still are planning the move to Fort Devens,which is to start this fall and continue until 1997.andP;  The headquarterscomponent of ISC is staffed by about 1,200 people, he said.andM;Several officials familiar with Vanguard agreed to be interviewed oncondition of anonymity.andP;  They said that under the current plan, keysubordinate agencies of ISC would continue to exist but would be folded intoother organizations -- in some cases, returning to the commands that housedthem before 1984.andM;&quot;It's one of the few things they're talking about doing that makes somesense,&quot; one official said.andP;  He said eliminating the command would not reallyaffect the work done by its subordinate agencies.andM;As of now, he said, the Information Systems Engineering Command (ISEC) isslated to become part of the Army Material Command and the InformationSystems Management Activity (ISMA) would be transferred to theCommunications-Electronics Command.andP;  AMC is headquartered in Arlington, Va.,andO;and CECOM in Eatontown, N.J.andM;ISEC also is headquartered at Fort Huachuca, where it operates the ArmyComputer Engineering Center, providing custom engineering and consulting toArmy users and systems designers, according to Douglas Garman, an ISECspokesman.andM;ISEC also manages the Information Systems Software Center (ISSC) at FortBelvoir, Va., which operates a network of five software development shopsnationwide.andP;  ISSC is responsible for many of the Army's key softwareengineering initiatives, particularly in the Ada programming language.andM;ISMA, at Fort Monmouth, N.J., is unique in the Army in that it is financed inpart by ISC but also by the Material Command, ISMA spokesman Steve Larsonsaid.andP;  Officials did not know whether the ISMA-AMC relationship wouldcontinue if the rumored transfer to CECOM occurs.andM;Officials familiar with today's Pentagon session said that under the Vanguardplan the Army would eliminate ISC and transfer the subordinate agencies in1992.andM;Short took over as ISC commander in June when Lt.andP;  Gen.andP;  Thurman D. Rodgersmoved from ISC to be director of the Defense Communications Agency.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
