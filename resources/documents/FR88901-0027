Background </ITAG>In our original Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR), we set forth at considerablelength the reasons prompting the Board to embark on rulemaking to establishappropriate bargaining units in the health care field. These reasons areset forth fully at 52 FR 25142-25145, July 2, 1987. Following the Notice, the Board conducted the three hearings announcedin the Notice, as well as a fourth hearing requested by several interestedparties and announced at 52 FR 29038. At these hearings, all who wishedto testify were given an opportunity to do so, and all who wished to askquestions of the various witnesses were given that opportunity. Summaries(cited below as WS) submitted in advance by most of the prospective witnessesfacilitated the questioning process. The first hearing was held in Washington, DC on August 17 and 18, 1987;20 witnesses appeared, and 496 pages of testimony were taken. The second hearing was in Chicago, Illinois on August 31 and September1, 1987; 27 witnesses appeared, and 521 pages of testimony were taken.The third hearing was in San Francisco, California on September 14, 15,and 16, 1987; 39 witnesses appeared, and 762 pages of testimony were taken.The final and longest hearing was back in Washington, DC on October 7,8, 9, 13, 14, 15, and 16, 1987; 58 witnesses appeared, and 1766 pages oftestimony were taken. The comment period, which was originally to last through October 30, 1987,was thereafter extended three times upon the request of various parties[52 FR 36589, 43919, and 47029]. The evidence received by the Board atthe hearings and during the comment period substantially exceeded, in bothdetail and exhaustiveness, what the Board had expected. The transcriptof hearing totals 3545 pages, and the 144 individuals who came in personto testify included employees from virtually every broad classificationunder consideration: registered nurses, physicians, other professionals,technicals, skilled maintenance employees, service and related employees,and business office clericals. In addition, there were union and managementnegotiators from around the country; a number of professors of nursing,health care management, and other academic disciplines; hospital administrators;health care associations such as the American Medical Association (AMA);representatives of numerous unions including the American Federation ofLabor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL), Service EmployeesInternational Union (SEIU), International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT),United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), InternationalUnion of Operating Engineers (IUOE), American Nurses Association (ANA)and several of its state associations, Hospital Employees' Labor Programof Metropolitan Chicago (H.E.L.P.), United Nurses' Association of California(UNAC), Communication Workers of America (CWA), Union of American Physiciansand Dentists (UAPD), New York State Federation of Physicians and Dentists;and representatives of various employer groups such as the League of VoluntaryHospitals and Homes of New York, American Hospital Association (AHA), NewJersey Hospital Association (NJHA), Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council,Missouri Hospital Association, Ohio Hospital Association, Affiliated Hospitalsof San Francisco, California Association of Hospitals and Health Systems,Associated Hospitals of the East Bay, Hospital Council of Southern California,American Health Care Association, and Hospital Council of Western Pennsylvania.During the comment period, the Board received written comments from 315individuals and organizations, representing diverse points of view andoffering information to supplement what the Board had learned from theoral testimony. These comments alone totalled approximately 1500 pages.In addition, following the close of the hearings, lengthy comments in thenature of briefs were submitted by the AHA; the ANA; the Building and ConstructionTrades Department of the AFL-CIO; the IUOE; and the AFL, on behalf of SEIU;National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees (NUHHCE); Local 1199,Drug, Hospital and Health Care Employees Union, Retail, Wholesale, DepartmentStore Union (Local 1199); Federation of Nurses and Health Care Professionals,American Federation of Teachers (AFT); American Federation of State, Countyand Municipal Employees (AFSCME); CWA; International Union, United AutoWorkers; UFCW; and United Steelworkers of America. The Board is gratified at, and appreciative of, the interest shown in theseproceedings by all segments of the industry, including its employees andtheir representatives. The Board has spent a great deal of time reviewingthe evidence collected and the comments received, and believes it is nowfar better qualified to resolve the issues raised in the Notice of ProposedRulemaking.On July 1, 1988, the Board met in open session to discuss further the issueof appropriate bargaining units in the health care industry. The rulestentatively decided upon in that meeting and proposed below have been derivedfrom our analysis of the empirical evidence and comments received duringthe rulemaking proceeding. The rules now proposed differ in several importantrespects from the rules proposed in our original Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.Because this is the Board's first major effort at substantive rulemaking,and because the Board is desirous of giving all interested parties a furtheropportunity to comment on the proposed rules, including the substantialrevisions, we have provided for another period of comment. See, e.g., Note,<T3>The Need for An Additional Notice and Comment Period When Final RulesDiffer Substantially From Interim Rules, </T3>1981 Duke L.J. 377 (1981).This Second NPR contains a lengthy Supplementary Information Sec., addressingthe major issues presented and containing numerous citations to the rulemakingrecord. We wish to emphasize that these citations are merely illustrativeof the testimony upon which we relied and are not represented as the entiretyof the record. We have carefully studied the complete rulemaking record,including the transcript, the witnesses' statements, the comments and briefs,and the exhibits, and have based our proposed rules on the entirety ofthis record, and not solely on the testimony specifically cited. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Validity and Desirability of Rulemaking </ITAG>A. Introduction The Board's statutory authority to engage in rulemaking is derived fromsection 6 of the National Labor Relations Act, which expressly gives theBoard power to make ``such rules and regulations * * * as may be necessaryto carry out the provisions of this Act * * *.'' In response to several commentators' concerns (e.g., AHA Br. 48; Comment289, Ross; WS Albanese, Charter Medical), and also to the concern expressedby our dissenting colleague, the fact that the language of section 9(b)requires a separate determination ``in each case'' does not in our opinionmean that the Board cannot promulgate rules to assist it. (See discussionat 52 FR 25144.) It has long been the Board's practice to formulate ``rules''to guide it in representation matters. See, e.g., the ``contract bar rules,''discussed in <T3>Appalachian Shale Products Co., </T3>121 NLRB 1160 (1958); the ``ExcelsiorRule,'' enunciated in <T3>Excelsior Underwear Inc., </T3>156 NLRB 1236 (1966); and the <T3>Peerless Plywood </T3>rule, 107 NLRB 427, 429 (1953). Although theserules were formulated by adjudication rather than APA rulemaking, and amajority of the Supreme Court in <T3>NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., </T3>394 U.S. 759 (1969), upheld the validityof the particular rule (the <T3>Excelsior </T3>rule) as applied to the respondent in that case, theplurality implied, and the two dissents explicitly stated, that the Congressionally-preferredcourse for such prospective pronouncements would be APA rulemaking. Toour knowledge, no court or academic commentator has ever made the contrarysuggestion, that section 9(b) forbids utilization of APA procedures toformulate generally applicable representation case rules. As Kenneth CulpDavis observed with specific reference to the language of section 9(b),``The mandate to decide `in each case' does not prevent the Board fromsupplanting the original discretionary chaos with some degree of order,and the principal instruments for regularizing the system of `decidingin each case' are classifications, rules, principles, and precedents. Sensiblemen could not refuse to use such instruments and a sensible Congress wouldnot expect them to.'' Davis, <T3>Administrative Law Text </T3>145 (3d ed. 1972).\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ See also <T3>Continental Web Press v. NLRB, </T3>742 F.2d 1087, 1093-94 (7th Cir.1984), in which Judge Posner suggests that the Board's decision in thatcase with respect to lithographic units would have been more acceptablehad the Board used ``its dormant rulemaking powers;'' and <T3>NLRB v. Majestic Weaving Co., </T3>355 F.2d 854, 859-61 (2d Cir. 1966)(Friendly, J.), cited by the court in <T3>Continental Web Press. </T3>In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we set forth at length our reasonsfor embarking on this procedure in the health care industry. Initially,we noted that thirteen years had elapsed since the health care amendmentswere passed, but none of the Board's previously enunciated doctrinal formulasfor determining appropriate health care units had yet met with generaljudicial acceptance. Moreover, in numerous cases it had proven necessaryto engage in lengthy, costly litigation over the appropriate bargainingunit or units. In retrospect, it appeared to the Board that there had beenrelative uniformity of workforce configurations and job classificationsfrom facility to facility, and even under adjudication the various Boardmembers had reached virtually identical results from case to case. Hence,it did not appear that what some have termed ``sensitive, case-by-caseadjudication'' was serving any useful purpose. The Board also  acknowledgedthat for years it had been urged to engage in APA rulemaking by numerousscholars and judges. In making the decision to engage in rulemaking, theBoard expressed the expectation that this type of proceeding would producethe type of empirical evidence most appropriate for a determination asto which of the requested groups warranted separate bargaining units, whilenot creating such undesirable results as excessive proliferation, interruptionin the delivery of health care services, jurisdictional disputes, wagewhipsawing, and the like. A fuller exposition of the Board's initial reasonsfor undertaking rulemaking can be found at 52 FR 25143-145.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In the NPR, we observed that a number of states, includingFlorida and Massachusetts, had engaged in rulemaking to formulate appropriatebargaining units for their own employees. 52 FR 25145, fn. 39. We takeofficial notice that, as of November 1987, of the 22 states with comprehensivecollective bargaining legislation for state employees, ten (Alaska, California,Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York andOhio) set their units by administrative rulemaking, and four (Hawaii, Minnesota,Nebraska, and Wisconsin) designate them by statute. Only eight (Illinois,Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Islandand Vermont) establish units through case-by-case adjudication. Following its issuance of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Board permittedthe parties to comment on this matter, and to present testimony in supportof their positions. A significant number of health care providers, includingthe American Hospital Association, opposed the Board's rulemaking efforts.We have carefully considered all their arguments and the evidence submittedin support thereof.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Industry's Position </ITAG>1. <T3>Dynamics and diversity of health care industry. </T3>One argument advancedby a number of employers in opposition to rulemaking was that the dynamicsand diversity of the industry preclude it. Thus, the imposition of diagnosticrelated groups (DRGs) has required new efforts at cost containment (WSRhodes [AHA] at 1,4; Comment 108, Bonaventure; Comment 130, St. Vincent'sHosp. Ala; Comment 193, Dolly Vinsant Memorial Hospital; Comment 268, Kane).Inflationary pressures have increased while revenues, particularly forin-patient stays, have either decreased or have been governed by ceilings.(Comment 76, South Suburban Hosp; AHA Br. 3-4; Comment 81, Jordan Hospital;Comment 146, Kennebec Valley Medical Center.) Severe shortages in certaincategories of employees have required hospitals to be flexible, which,it is alleged, is inconsistent with the relative inflexibility of rules(Comment 133, Beth Israel Hosp.). At the same time, there has developed an increasing diversity in hospitalsand the services they provide (King, 4232; Comment 19, Johnson City MedicalCenter Hosp.). Thus, hospitals of all types and sizes are establishingnew types of related health care services on outpatient as well as inpatientbases (AHA Br. 5; Dauner, 3217; Comment 44, McDonough District Hosp.; Comment71, St. Mary Hosp.; Comment 76, South Suburban Hosp.; Comment 174, HighPlains Baptist Hosp., etc.). Many hospitals are expanding their marketsby developing a number of specialty units, such as arthritis units (AHABr. 7, citing <T3>Modern Healthcare, </T3>July 31, 1987, p. 42); intensive cardiac care,intensive medical/surgical, and neonatal units (Comment 71, St. Mary'sHosp.); trach units, dialysis units, etc. (Comment 78, Greater CincinnatiHosp. Council). Another change is that hospitals are using part-time workersin increasing numbers to accommodate rapid fluctuations in inpatient censusand reduction in full-time employee schedules (AHA Br. 7). One large groupof proprietary hospitals, National Medical Enterprises, has extensivelyanalyzed services provided in its hospitals to determine what allegedlyprofessional services could be handled by non-professionals; in some ofits facilities, it has implemented the ``caregiver'' concept to replacetraditional job labels, within the limits of the classifications' competency.(Donnelly, 4063-80.) It is alleged that rulemaking is not suited for today'sdiverse and complex institutions (AHA, King, 4232). 2. <T3>Changing structure. </T3>The industry's witnesses presented evidencethat the structure of the industry is changing in that hospitals are becomingparts of larger systems encompassing intermediate care facilities, urgentcare centers, nursing homes, surgery centers, clinics, etc. (Rhodes, 9-11;NJHA, 320-324, 325; Dauner, 3194; Comment 66, Holy Cross Health Sys.; Comment203, Deaconess Hosp.). It is alleged that an inflexible rule will impedethe Board's ability to respond quickly to rapid changes in the industry(AHA, pos. st. 2). It is claimed that, because of the myriad of recentchanges, this is an inopportune time to engage in rulemaking, which wouldbe better done after the industry has had time to settle down from thecurrent changes (Robfogel, Chi II 233). 3. <T3>Prospects for litigation. </T3>A number of representatives of the industrycontended that rulemaking will not reduce the amount of litigation, partlybecause it will still be unclear into what category various occupationsfall (Rhodes, 14; Stickler, 49; Owley, 4379-80; Comment 213, Mulhall, AtlantiCareMedical Center); there will be continuing litigation over the ``specialsituations'' exception (Comment 148, Moeller, Mississippi Hosp. Assn.);and, in general, the industry anticipates more litigation rather than aconservation of agency resources (Stickler, letter dated June 19, 1987,RM 2-10; Comment 289, Ross). C. Opposing Position 1. <T3>Litigation. </T3>Though the vast bulk of industry commentators opposedrulemaking, two did not oppose it. Thus, one hospital agreed with the observationthat unit determinations in the industry were confused and hard to follow,deeming rulemaking a ``welcome relief.'' (Comment 5, Kane, Holy RedeemerHealth System.) Kaiser also does not oppose rulemaking, having observedprotracted litigation elsewhere in the industry. (Comment 313, addendumto Kaiser comment.) One student with prior experience as a department headin several hospitals observed that rulemaking may help reduce costs inthe industry, so that parties can spend fewer dollars on legal maneuveringand less time on organizing campaigns, leading to more industrial stability.(Comment 122, Shumlas.) The unions participating in these proceedings supported the Board's rulemakingefforts. (ANA Br. 192-93; New York State Federation of Physicians and Dentists,79-80; Health Professionals and Allied Employees of New Jersey (HPAE),122, 127; Union of American Physicians and Dentists, 3649; SEIU, 5155;IUOE, Br. 106; IBT, Saporta, 5101.) They acknowledged the protracted litigationthat had theretofore ensued (e.g., Saporta, 5141-42; HPAE, 122, 24; MinnesotaNurses Assoc., WS Patek; Federation of Nurses and Health Profs, WS Owleyandamp; 4379-80), producing lengthy delays and great difficulties in organizing(e.g., Lumpkin, 84-85; Nathan, 79-80; Union of American Physicians andDentists, 3649). One management-side consultant is reported to have admittedthat such delays were often part of management's strategy in contestinghealth care units:<ITAG tagnum="21">At a workshop on unions, Raymond Mickus, president of Raymond F. Mickusandamp; Associates in Bannockburn, Ill., predicted that the NLRB rules willspark much more union activity. . . . Under the rules there will be much,faster elections, he said, adding that employers won't have access to hearingsor briefs which used to delay the proceedings * * *. There also will beless costs for the unions because they will not have to spend the ``megabucks''associated with the hearing process, he said. (Current Developments, BNADaily Labor Report, Aug. 6, 1987, p. A-2.)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Shortly thereafter, another health care industry representative isreported to have said something very similar: ``Delaying representationelections. The greater the time between the initial union petition andthe election the less chance there is that the union will win.'' (Metzger,vice president of labor relations for Mount Sinai Medical Center, discussingmanagement's strategy, though not necessarily advocating it himself. Reportedin Current Developments, BNA Daily Labor Report, Sept. 29, 1987.)2. <T3>Diversity. </T3>There is some variation between institutions. No twohospitals are exactly alike, but this is true of all institutions. Therelevant question, however, is whether, despite surface differences, thereare such similarities that certain institutions may properly be groupedas a class. AHA data from 1986 show that while there are a number of differenttypes of health care providers, the overwhelming majority of private, acutecare hospitals are general medical and surgical hospitals. Of the 4,381registered, private acute care hospitals in the U.S., almost 90% are classifiedby AHA as general hospitals; less than 9% are classified as psychiatric.Of the general hospitals, 98% are medical and surgical hospitals, whileonly 2% are pediatric, obstetric, or rehabilitation hospitals. (AFL Exh.7,8.) Inpatient activity accounts for 84% of hospital revenues, and 88%of inpatient beds are allocated to general medical and surgical care, obstetrics,pediatrics, and intensive care. (AFL Exh. 9,10.) The unions contend thatthe industry has not shown that such diversity as does exist is reflectedin different functions for business office clericals, skilled maintenanceemployees, unskilled service workers, etc. at the different types of facilities.The unions concede the presence of cost pressures which have changed theclimate in which hospitals must operate today (AFL Br. 134; WS Berliner;Comment 293(i), Feldsine). However, they argue that change is endemic inthe health care field, and contend that recent changes are not qualitativelydifferent from changes brought about by the advent of private health insuranceor introduction of Medicare and Medicaid, equally profound and dramaticchanges (Kennedy, 5549-50). As reflected in the testimony about particularjob classifications, DRGs are an accounting and financing mechanism thathas nothing to do with the organization of the hospital labor force, andthat has not resulted in employees performing jobs that were traditionallyperformed by other groups of employees (Kennedy, 5551-53; Berliner, 5628-29).In fact, business office clericals' skills have been upgraded because ofincreased complexity of their work caused by financial pressures (Berliner,5600). The unskilled workforce has become even less skilled and more vulnerableto layoffs caused by financial shortfalls (Berliner, 5603-04). Similarly,technical employee ranks have declined in the least skilled technical positionswhile increasing in the most skilled positions as a result of industrychanges (WS Berliner at 11-12; WS Schoen at 14-15). Skilled maintenanceemployees continue to maintain the physical plant (AFL Br. 132). Neitherhas the role of RNs changed; they continue to provide direct care to patientsand clients as in the past (ANA Br. 163). 3. <T3>Changing structure. </T3>There was evidence that, at least in California,the trend toward consolidation of ownership and management of hospitalsinto multi-hospital organizations appears to have ended (AFL Exh. 17 atp. 2, from California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems Report). Further,corporate mergers and larger organizational changes have not affected relationshipsbetween traditional job classifications; rather, the changes are in thecorporate officers, locus, and method of corporate decision-making (Federationof Nurses and Health Profs, WS Owley; Patek, Chi I 48; Twomey, 126-127).In any event, the proposed rule does not purport to address the issue ofthe appropriateness of a single facility when an employer owns a numberof facilities, which the Board will continue to address through adjudication.<T3>Manor Healthcare Corp., </T3>285 NLRB No. 31 (Aug. 6, 1987). D. Conclusion 1. <T3>Agency discretion. </T3>The choice between deciding an issue throughadjudication or APA rulemaking is, in the final analysis, within the informeddiscretion of an administrative agency. <T3>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </T3>332 U.S. 194, 203 (1947); <T3>NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </T3>416 U.S. 267, 294 (1974); <T3>NLRB v. Children's Baptist Home, </T3>576 F.2d 256, 260 (9th Cir. 1978);<T3>NLRB v. St. Francis Hospital of Lynwood, </T3>601 F.2d 404, 414 (9thCir. 1979). Here, we have carefully reconsidered our initial decision inlight of all the evidence adduced at the hearings. After examining allthis evidence, we remain convinced that rulemaking for establishing appropriatebargaining units in health care institutions is both fair and desirable.The record of these proceedings has supported and amplified our originalreasons, set forth in our first NPR, for engaging in rulemaking. 2. <T3>Past adjudicatory decisions. </T3>Our adjudicatory decisions as toappropriate units in the health care industry, where the facts of eachcase were painstakingly examined in numerous lengthy and costly representationcase proceedings, have been remarkably uniform in results, varying onlywhen the Board changed doctrinal formulations, e.g., from ``community''to ``disparity'' of interests. (NLRB Exh. 5, revised.) Thus, for example,from 1975 to 1984, despite lengthy adjudicatory proceedings the Board foundRN units appropriate in 24 out of 25 published cases;\3\<NOTE/> technical units appropriate in 18 out of 18 cases; businessoffice clerical units appropriate in 8 out of 8 cases; etc. Though adjudicationled to varying results for skilled maintenance units, that was largelya function of a single Board member, Member Jenkins, reaching differentresults on different records. Other members were, individually, remarkablyuniform, despite alleged differences in the records. E.g., Member and ChairmanFanning found the separate maintenance unit appropriate 29 out of 29 times;Chairman Murphy, 26 out of 26 times. Continuing to determine appropriateunits in this way seems unproductive, especially considering the lack ofuniversal judicial approval of any single doctrinal approach. (See NPR,52 FR 25143.) <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The sole exception was <T3>Mount Airy Psychiatric Center, </T3>253 NLRB 1003 (1981), involvinga psychiatric hospital. In each category, unpublished cases exhibited thesame uniformity of result. 3. <T3>Financial constraints. </T3>It cannot be denied that health care institutionsare at this time operating under serious financial constraints. However,the evidence fails to disclose that these constraints have significantlychanged the manner in which individual employee classifications performtheir specialties or relate to one another. For example, the record showsthat maintenance employees continue to maintain the physical facilities,and RNs continue to provide direct patient care under state nursing practiceacts. If anything, the work of the business office clericals has been shownto have become more specialized and discrete, due to the increasing complexityof  reimbursement arrangements, and also the increasing use of computersand word processing equipment. It is our judgment that the increased predictabilitywhich rulemaking will bring to the process of determining bargaining unitswill, in the long run, be a resource saver and, hence, result in cost savingsnot only for the Board but also for health care institutions as well asfor employee organizations. Money expended on the <T3>procedure </T3>of determining appropriate units is not productivelyspent, except insofar as it leads to a greater understanding by the Boardof the realities of the workplace; we believe the understanding of thehealth care industry we have achieved through this rulemaking proceedinghas been greater than it was through adjudication, where each party presenteda very narrow view of the evidence in order to achieve victory in thatparticular case. Lastly, insofar as adjudication enabled employers to delayand in that sense save additional costs that might be associated with unionization,we do not think that is an appropriate factor to be considered by the Boardin support of continuing adjudication.4. <T3>Diversity of institutions. </T3>Just as this proceeding has not shownthat new cost constraints have made rulemaking inappropriate, neither dowe find that any new diversification of institutions has had this result.Such diversity as exists has not been shown to be sufficiently significantto preclude uniform treatment for purposes of establishing the generalcontours of appropriate bargaining units \4\<NOTE/> for acute care hospitals in all but truly extraordinary facilities.In fact, one witness, the Vice President of Human Resources, Hospital Councilof Western Pennsylvania, testified that, even beyond acute care facilities,``the delivery of health care and the functional integration of servicesof those providing the care is similar if not nearly identical throughoutthe health care industry.'' (Cammarata, 4394). That same witness pointedout that this similarity in the way health care is delivered is ``indeedmandated by various accreditation agencies throughout the health care field''(WS Cammarata at 3). The evidence discloses that the vast numbers of hospitalsstill perform acute care; insofar as other diverse facilities have developed,such as ambulatory facilities, freestanding emergency centers, etc., thesewill be considered <T3>infra, </T3>and in our definition of the types of facilities coveredby this rulemaking or, alternatively, excluded. Recognizing the diversityof facilities other than acute care hospitals and nursing homes, as wellas our limited experience with them, the original NPR excluded such otherfacilities from consideration in the rulemaking proceeding. These otherhealth care facilities continue to be excluded from coverage. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ See Subrin, <T3>Conserving Energy at the Labor Board: The Case for Making Rules onCollective Bargaining Units, </T3>32 Lab. L.J. 9 (1987), at 105-108. 5. <T3>Litigation. </T3>As described above, the Board anticipates that rulemakingwill ultimately result in less, rather than more, litigation about theboundaries of appropriate units. It is acknowledged that there will stillbe litigation about the placement of individual job classifications withinthe broadly  defined appropriate units. This was referred to in our initialNPR (52 NPR 25146), and in the proposed new rule itself (andSection; 103.30(a));the Board does not see this as a reason not to engage in rulemaking inorder first to establish the larger boundaries of the appropriate units.The Board believes it may well be legally necessary, and in any event iswise, to retain an exception for extraordinary circumstances. However,the Board intends to define that exception narrowly, so that it cannotbe used as an excuse for unnecessary litigation and delay. See sectionXX, The Extraordinary Circumstance Exception, <T3>infra. </T3>6. <T3>Flexibility. </T3>The Board's engaging in rulemaking has no logicalconnection with the industry's retention of complete flexibility in respondingto the needs of the times. Rulemaking is rather a response to a perceptionthat the industry's workforce is susceptible to rules of general applicabilityabout the contours of bargaining units. Health care providers remain asfree as they ever were to respond to external events except, of course,as limited by the constraints of any collective-bargaining obligationsthat may result from unionization; that, however, is a policy set by Congress,not the Board.

However, were we to continue to decide the appropriatenessof units in acute care hospitals solely by adjudication, we would not havethe advantage of the great mass of evidence presented to us in this rulemakingproceeding. Indeed, the production of relevant information is one of thechief advantages of rulemaking over adjudication. In addition, as notedabove, adjudication itself has resulted in non-fact-sensitive, virtuallyuniform results, but at great cost in terms both of time and money. Theseproblems, which we have observed in appropriate unit adjudications in thisindustry since the 1974 amendments, would not necessarily disappear, evenwere the Supreme Court to grant certiorari and endorse the ``communityof interests,'' ``disparity of interests,'' or some other standard. Lengthyhearings would still be required, and the Supreme Court is unlikely toinvolve itself in particularized, detailed factual inquiries over variousappropriate unit determinations. Finally, it is by no means certain thatthe Supreme Court would grant certiorari on this issue, having declinedto do so in <T3>NLRB v. Mercy Hospital Association, </T3>606 F.2d 22 (2d Cir. 1979),cert. denied 445 U.S. 971 (1980).

Standard To Be Applied in Determining Appropriate Units </ITAG>The Supreme Court has acknowledged on many occasions since the Act's passagethat, under section 9, the Board possesses broad discretion to determineemployee units ``appropriate'' for the purposes of collective bargaining.\5\<NOTE/> Of course, even the Board's discretion is not without limits;if the Board's decision as to appropriate unit ``oversteps the law,'' itmust be reversed.\6\<NOTE/> Within this limit, however, the Supreme Court has noted thatany decision as to appropriate units ``involves of necessity a large measureof informed discretion, and the decision of the Board, if not final, israrely to be disturbed.'' \7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>Allied Chemical andamp; Alkali Workers, Local No. 1 v.

NLRB, </T3>330 U.S. 485, 491 (1947). It has been observed that, in exercising its discretion to determine appropriateunits, the Board must steer a careful course between two undesirable extremes:If the unit is too large, it may be difficult to organize, and, when organized,will contain too diversified a constituency which may generate conflictsof interest and dissatisfaction among constituent groups, making it difficultfor the union to represent; on the other hand, if the unit is too small,it may be costly for the employer to deal with  because of repetitiousbargaining and/or frequent strikes, jurisdictional disputes and wage whipsawing,and may even be deleterious for the union by too severely limiting itsconstituency and hence its bargaining strength.\8\<NOTE/> The Board's goal is to find a middle-ground position, toallocate power between labor and management by ``striking the balance''in the appropriate place, with units that are neither too large nor toosmall.\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ See Gorman, <T3>Basic Text on Labor Law, </T3>66-69 (1976); Abodeely <T3>et al, The NLRB and the Appropriate Bargaining Unit </T3>12-13 (rev.ed. 1981); <T3>NLRB v.

As theD.C. Circuit recently observed, in passing the 1974 amendments ``Congress,in the final analysis, decided against modifying section 9 of the Act;\11\<NOTE/> * * * hence, the same statutory standards that had existedbefore the enactment of the 1974 Amendments with respect to unit determinationsand  certification procedures remained in the statute, entirely unmodified.''\12\<NOTE/> Even the D.C.

L. Rev. 163, 172 (1985).Under adjudication the Board has typically stated it was applying eitherthe ``community of interests'' or ``disparity of interests'' standard tothe facts of the particular case, as indicated reaching virtually the sameresult in every case, depending on which doctrine was being applied (NLRBExh. 5, revised). Under the ``community of interests'' test, the Boardhas found five or six units appropriate (not including a statutorily-requiredseparate unit of guards, seldom if ever sought, and a separate unit ofphysicians, sought in only one published decision since 1974 \18\<NOTE/>): RNs, other professionals, technicals, service and maintenance,and business office clericals. In addition, some individual Board membershave consistently found skilled maintenance units appropriate; others consistentlyfound them inappropriate. (NLRB Exhibit 5, revised.) Under the ``disparityof interests'' test, the Board has uniformly found three units appropriate,aside from the two seldom-sought units mentioned above: All professionalemployees, including RNs; technical employees; and service and maintenanceemployees, including business office clericals.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ <T3>Ohio Valley Hospital Assn., </T3>230 NLRB 604 (1977). See also <T3>Montefiore Hospital andamp; Medical Center, </T3>235 NLRB 241 (1978),where a separate unit of physicians and dentists was found appropriate,but largely because there were no other professionals employed at the employer'shealth center, which was deemed to constitute a separate appropriate location.Though it had consistently reached different results under the two tests,the Board in <T3>St. Vincent Hospital and Health Center, </T3>285 NLRB No. 64 (Aug.19, 1987), minimized the conceptual difference between them. Both, theBoard stated, looked at the same factors:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the ``disparity-of-interests'' standard to a significant extentembodies the ``community-of-interests'' approach. That is, even under thedisparity approach, the Board judges the appropriateness of the unit soughtin terms of, traditional community-of-interests criteria: employees' wages,hours, and working conditions; qualifications, training, and skills; frequencyof contacts and extent of interchange with each other; frequency of transfersinto and out of the unit sought; common supervision; degree of functionalintegration; collective-bargaining history; and area bargaining patternsand practices. Under the ``disparity-of-interests'' standard_as under the``community-of-interest'' approach_the Board looks at the above factorsas they are shared by employees in the unit petitioned for, and as theytend to set those employees apart from other employees. Where the ``disparity-of-interests''formulation differs from the ``community-of-interests'' standard, accordingto the Board's <T3>St. Francis II </T3>decision, is in the significance afforded the abovefactors. Because of Congress admonition to avoid unit fragmentation, the``disparity-of-interests'' test requires more in the way of ``disparities''or differences between the employees requested and those in an overallunit to grant a separate unit in the health care industry than would berequired under a ``community-of-interests'' formulation. (Slip op. at 10-11,footnotes deleted.)</ITAG>It is difficult to weigh or quantify the requirement of ``more'' as itapplies to separate, different interests, i.e., how much would be enoughmore to satisfy the ``disparities'' test? Regardless, as we observed inthe NPR, ``these tests over the past decade or so have developed a `lifeof their own,' and have been taken to refer to more or fewer units, respectively* * *.'' (52 FR 25143.) As the Board stated in <T3>Newton-Wellesley Hospital, </T3>250 NLRB 409, 411 (1980), various courts'``disagreement with our approach may be largely semantic.'' And, as theSecond Circuit said in <T3>Masonic Hall v. NLRB, </T3>699 F.2d 626, 637 (1983), a court sometimesenforces the Board's decision if it ``can infer from the Board's resultthat it has taken the nonproliferation policy into account.'' The courtsuggested that perhaps courts ``focus * * * on what the Board did as muchon what it said.'' <T3>Id. </T3>As noted in the NPR (52 FR at 25143), and in our discussionabove, our decision to determine units by rulemaking reflected a desireto replace earlier doctrinal applications with formulations of units basedon the facts, or realities, of the workplace, as learned from evidencepresented to the Board by interested parties during the rulemaking proceedings.Under rulemaking as under adjudication, we intend at all times to be mindfulof avoiding undue proliferation, not only because this desire was expressedin the legislative history, but also because it accords with our own viewof what is appropriate in the health care industry. It would be most undesirableto create or permit a large-scale splintering of the workforce into thenumerous trades, technical disciplines, and professions typically foundin health care institutions.\19\<NOTE/> To give each such grouping a separate voice for organizingand negotiating would create a never-ending round of bargaining sessionsand individualized demands not conducive to stability, industrial peace,or the smooth delivery of services to the public. We have entered the rulemakingendeavor with an intention to create a reasonable number of units thatwill realistically reflect pronounced natural groupings to be found inhealth care facilities: groupings that will not be so large that organizingthem is exceedingly difficult, and representing them even harder becauseof inherent conflicts of interest within the groups; but large enough thatunnecessary, repetitious rounds of bargaining are avoided along with suchundesirable results as frequent strikes, wage whipsawing, and jurisdictionaldisputes. We have not begun with a preordained number, but at the end ofour examination will consider whether the numbers of units found appropriateare, in fact, too numerous. See section XXI, Proliferation, <T3>infra. </T3>In any event, there will be no units found appropriatebesides those permitted in the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ As Abodeely notes, ``the health care industry was believedto be particularly vulnerable to the formation of a multiplicity of bargainingunits. From the doctors in the top echelon to pot washers on the bottom,the labor force of a large health care facility is composed of a highlystratified, complex myriad of occupational classifications.'' This was,Abodeely states, the purpose behind the proliferation language referredto in the legislative history. Abodeely, <T3>supra, </T3>at 245. See also <T3>NLRB v. Hillview Health Care Center, </T3>705 F.2d at 1470.Although under rulemaking we shall attempt to avoid the doctrinal formulationsutilized under adjudication, many of the factors we consider will be similar.Thus, among the factors to be considered will be uniqueness of function;training, education and licensing; wages, hours and working conditions;supervision; employee interaction; and factors relating to collective bargaining,such as bargaining history, matters of special concern, etc. Location andscope of the job market may be relevant: i.e., whether the classificationis part of a job market external to the facility or even to health care,or rather shares a job market with others in the facility or, perhaps,in the areawide health care community; job market is a factor not extensivelyconsidered under adjudication, probably because evidence regarding it isnot likely to be introduced during the litigation of a particular case.In addition to these factors, should the evidence reveal the possibilityof a separate unit, we shall examine the likelihood that such a separateunit would result in interruption in the delivery of health care, wagewhipsawing, or jurisdictional disputes, matters with which Congress expressedconcern during the deliberations that preceded the 1974 amendments. (See,e.g., 52 FR 25145; <T3>St. Francis Hospital (St. Francis I),</T3> 265 NLRB 1025, 1027, 1035(1982) (dissent, Chairman Van de Water); but cf. <T3>Manor Healthcare Corp., </T3>285 NLRB No. 31, n.7 (Aug. 6, 1987).)\20\<NOTE/> The emphasis, during our rulemaking deliberations, has beenand will be on the empirical_what, according to the mass of evidence presented,is warranted and will   facilitate collective bargaining without jeopardizingthe public interest_as opposed to prior, more doctrinal, more conceptuallyoriented, determinations. We are confident we are now a better informedadministrative body in exercising the substantial discretion which we possessin the area of unit determinations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Senator Taft, in opening the Congressional debate onthe health care amendments, said: ``The issue of proliferation of bargainingunits in health care institutions has also greatly concerned me. Hospitalsand other types of health care institutions are particularly vulnerableto a multiplicity of bargaining units due to the diversified nature ofthe medical services provided patients. If each professional interest andjob classification is permitted to form a separate bargaining unit, numerousadministrative and labor relations problems become involved in the deliveryof health care. . . . I believe this is a sound approach and a constructivecompromise as the Board should be permitted some flexibility in unit determinationcases. I cannot stress enough, however, the importance of great cautionbeing exercised by the Board in reviewing unit cases in this area. Unwarrantedunit fragmentation leading to jurisdictional disputes and work stoppagesmust be prevented.'' <T3>Legislative History of the Coverage of Non-Profit Hospitals Under theNational Labor Relations Act, </T3>at 113-14. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Two Units: All Professionals/All Non-Professionals </ITAG>Some members of the hospital industry have argued to us that if the Boardengages in rulemaking, it should find only two units appropriate_all professionaland all non-professional employees (in addition to guards). Upon considerationof the record, we determine that the evidence does not warrant limitingthe number of units to two broad units. A. Generally; History of the 1974 Amendments While the industry generally supports two broad units of employees, thesupport is not universal. Some employers suggest other configurations includinga wall-to-wall unit, a separate doctors' unit, and a separate technicalunit. (Comment 1, Lancaster Fairfield Community Hospital; Comment 17, MiddletownRegional Hospital; Comment 306, Herrin, attorney for health care associations.)Indeed, one employer felt that several separate units was equitable aseach had its own characteristics. (Comment 2, Grays Harbor Community Hosp.)The position of some, in favor of two units, is inconsistent with evidencewhich shows that until <T3>St. Francis II, </T3>employers seldom requested all-professional orall non-professional units (Friedman, 5057), and that where employers didrequest broad units for elections they sometimes opposed such units duringelection campaigns or at the bargaining table (see Registered Nurses, sectionV). On the other hand, unions fully support more than two broad units fororganizing (AFL Br. 112; IUOE Br. 8; Local 1199, 3742; FNHP, 3; UFCW, 4457;NUHHCE, 4778; IBT, 5100; SEIU, 5161). These unions' position is consistentwith the evidence presented of organizing history (see section V, RegisteredNurses; section IX, Skilled Maintenance; section X, Business Office Clericals;etc.). Contrary to some employers' claim that the legislative history of the hospitalamendments supports a two-unit configuration, the history shows that Congresschose not to amend section 9(b) (assuring employees the fullest freedomin exercising rights guaranteed by the Act) in a way that would enact specialrepresentation case rules for the health care industry. Even Senator Taft'sproposal, which embodied the proposal advanced by <T3>employer</T3> associations in the health care industry but which diedin committee, contained special rules establishing as presumptively appropriatethree non-professional units (technical, clerical, service and maintenance),in addition to a professional unit and guards, for a total of five. Furthermore,the hospital industry agreed, in a negotiated compromise with organizedlabor, to abandon its request for special statutory rules limiting thenumber of hospital units in return for provisions governing strikes. (SeeLegislative History, <T3>supra, </T3>at 91 (Sen. Cranston); 256 (Sen. Taft); 288 (Rep. Thompson),cited in AFL Br. 18-27.) The arguments of many employers that all professionalsinteract on the job, and that there are insufficient distinctions betweenclassifications of non-professional employees to warrant their separationinto different units, and the unions' argument that the record supportsseparate associational interests, are dealt with under specific unit categories.B. The Record Shows That Multiple Units Do Not Undermine Functional Integrationof Work; Do Not Result in an Increase in Proliferation, Strikes, JurisdictionalDisputes, or Wage Whipsawing; and Do Not Substantially Increase IndustryCosts The industry's concerns with having more than two units are the following:1. <T3>Changes in the industry. </T3>The industry has failed to support itsclaim by concrete evidence that the DRG method of government payments tohospitals has resulted in restructuring of hospital workforces away fromtraditional departments and toward a product-line organization that requiresgreater integration of employee functions. It is claimed that product linemanagement (where different types of employees work in a service relatedgroup, for example cardiology) is used increasingly in hospitals and requiresthat traditional lines of employment be crossed to provide appropriatepatient care as employees in a department cooperate (Abramovitz, 325; Comment54, Gepford Hosp.; Comment 192, Chicago Healthcare Human Resources Assn;Comment 108, Resurrection Health Care Corp.). However, the evidence showsthat product line management has less to do with actual practice on thewards than it does with financial operations performed in the businessoffice (WS Kennedy at 6-7). There is no more interaction between professionalsthan under other forms of financial control. New financial requirementshave not resulted in changes in interaction among hospital workers. (WSKennedy at 6-7.) Even in hospitals where RNs and other professionals aresubject to dual lines of control (combining authority under own licensureand under team or functional department), RNs continue to report to nursingon clinical issues, and retain traditional responsibility for nursing (Comment293(i), Feldsine; Thompson, Chi II 107; Kennedy, 5561; Fine, 3146-48).Contrary to the generalized claim (Comment 105, Mass. Hospital Assn.) thatmultiple units would be divisive since one department might contain employeesfrom several units, specific evidence shows that separate units have notprevented effective use of product line management (Houston, 4031, 4048).In arguing that hospital workforces have moved away from a traditionalstructure, the industry relies heavily on the team concept, claiming thatits use has resulted in greater integration among employees requiring integrationof units (Rhodes, 11-12). However, the team concept dates back many yearsin this industry (AFL Exh. 12, 13, 14; AMA, 4348). Hospital representativesrelied on the existence of teams in their unsuccessful attempt to defeatthe 1974 amendments (ANA Br. 126). The record does not demonstrate a substantialincrease in the use of interdisciplinary teams since then (AFL Exh. 15,study by Temkin-Greener; WS Kennedy at 8-9). Although the industry argued that the team approach is widespread in thecountry and gave examples of many types of teams such as discharge planning,and special unit teams like oncology, diabetes, and cardiac rehabilitation(Mixon, Chi II 275; Gallagher, 3543-45; Comment 191, Trinity Lutheran Hosp.),the weight of the evidence shows that utilization of team care is neitherwidespread among hospitals, nor extensively used within hospitals (Bachus,Chi I 132; Lumpkin, 89-90; Dauner, 3236-40; McCullough, 4819-20; Gilmore,4910). A study of 60 randomly selected hospitals showed fewer than halfused discharge planning teams; a minority of the hospitals had specialunit teams such as diabetes, oncology, and cardiac rehabilitation (Attachmentto AFL Br. from Supplemental Testimony of L. Kennedy). Some hospitals donot utilize the team concept at all (Gilmore, 4910). Most hospitals withteams have no more than six or seven teams, with two to eight members ona team (Coney, 162; Thompson, Chi II 14-15, 72; Mixon, Chi II 277, 294-296),and a majority of employees do not participate on those teams (Bachus,Chi I 129-132). Specialized hospitals, such as children's hospitals, whichmay use multi-disciplinary teams to a greater extent, are atypical (AFLBr. 104). The evidence does not support the industry's claim that participation onteams changes the employee's role. Collaboration among professionals isnot new (Ballard, 56). For example, one of the most common teams is dischargeplanning which historically involves nursing and social work. But the teamapproach does not alter each licensed professional's responsibilities orscope of practice (Ballard, 56; Willman, 4461; Twomey, 131). For example,use of physicians, assistants and nurse practitioners does not alter physicians,scope of practice. Nor does participation on a team affect an employee'swages, hours of work, employment benefits, qualifications, training, skills,job functions, or history of bargaining (AFL Br. 104-105; Graybill, 4174-75;Houston, 4044-45). Where teams are used, only a small proportion of theprofessional employees are involved. Contact between the members of theteam is limited; each member continues to perform the specialized workof his or her profession. The time spent on a team is limited: team membersmay perform their work separately and then exchange information; team membersare not likely to engage in more than fleeting communication regardingcollective bargaining matters. (Thompson, Chi II 107, 109, 118-119, 121;and see section V, Registered Nurses, <T3>infra.</T3>) Recognition by the Joint Commission on Accreditation ofHospitals (JCAH) of the need for collaboration on the interdisciplinarylevel (AHA Br. 16 citing JCAH sec.) does not itself demonstrate that anychange in scope of practice occurs. There is evidence that various employees interact on hospital committeesto evaluate hospital programs, but the evidence failed to demonstrate thatthe interaction affects the professionals' responsibilities or scope ofpractice (see, e.g., AHA Position Statement p. 8). The industry made general, unsupported claims that separate units wouldinterfere with the development or use of the team approach (Graybill-Subrincolloquy, 4185-86; Donnelly, 4131; Coney, 162). There is no evidence thatseparate units have resulted in failure of professional integration andcooperation on teams (ANA Br. 139; Bullough, 4651-53). On the contrary,teams were shown to be compatible with presence of RN-only units (ANA Br.123; Thompson, Chi II 86-87; Houston 4048; Bullough, 4651-52).The industry's emphasis on teams and product lines focused almost exclusivelyon professional employees. There was no claim that these teams broughttechnical employees and unskilled service employees together in a singlegroup. Nor was it claimed that business office clericals were involvedin health care teams. (AFL Br. 75.) The evidence shows that interdisciplinaryteams do not include skilled maintenance employees (IUOE Br. 92; Mixon,Chi II 275). The industry contends that the use of multi-skilled employees is widespreadand on the increase as hospitals seek cost-cutting measures, address theneeds of rural hospitals with limited full time staffing needs and largefacilities with changing patient loads, and as employee shortages, agingand declining population lead to fewer workers; further, that adoptionof the proposed units will abrogate the ability of facilities to effectivelyutilize multi-trained employees whose skills cut across unit lines (AHABr. 8, 9; AHA Br. attachment 3 attaching survey by CAHEA; Rhodes, 11; Houston,4025-26, 4040-42; Comment 137, McDonough District Hospital; Comment 189,Memorial Health System, Inc.; Comment 193, Dolly Vinsant Memorial Hospital).However, the evidence shows that cross-training <T3>between job groups </T3>was not substantial and did not result in blurringlines between separate units. There are no examples of any group of professionalsbeing cross trained to perform work of RNs either in organized or unorganizedsettings (Stickler, 22-25; Twomey, 130-131). The interchange of RN functionsis not a viable concept because state licensing statutes preclude cross-trainingof other health professionals in patient care duties and responsibilitiesof RNs (Ballard, 56-57; Dumpel, 3277-78; Lipari, 3702-03; Rosen, 4665-67;Comment 293(j), paper on licensure of health care personnel). The evidence shows that multi-competency programs are overwhelmingly aimedat technical employees. They developed because of a perceived need to providetechnicians with a broader range of technician skills (WS Schoen, attachingarticle by F. Morgan). These programs are mainly confined to acquisitionof additional technical skills by employees already holding technical jobsas shown by the operation of the programs referred to in the record. Participantsin the Methodist Hospital ``Add-A-Comp'' program which provides employeeswith laboratory, respiratory therapy, electrocardiograph, emergency medicaltechnician, and similar skills are already licensed or credentialed andinclude employees having some of the listed skills (Stickler, 19-21 andamp;Chi I 36). Although the Multi-Competency Technical Program at the Universityof Alabama provides training in medical office skills, it is basicallydesigned to add basic x-ray skills or extend laboratory skills for technicianswho are already licensed (Stickler, 19-21, Chi I 36-38). There is no showingthat students trained in medical office skills actually perform technicaltasks. Furthermore, the mere existence of the program does not show widespreadparticipation, since the record fails to show there are many students involved(Stickler, Chi I 38-39). Moreover, even if these programs turn out a numberof multi-competent graduates, they are generally employed in physicians'offices or outpatient facilities rather than in hospitals (Schoen, 5236and WS Schoen, attaching article by F. Morgan) and their use thereforehas little relevance to units in acute care hospitals. We conclude from the record evidence that cross-training programs extendingbeyond the technical workforce are rare. Unskilled service workers cannotbe readily trained to become technical employees because they lack theadvanced education required and because of state licensure laws (AFL Br.35-36; IUOE Br. 42, fn 5). Service workers cannot be easily trained forbusiness office clerical jobs because of the specialized skills requiredin the business office (AFL Br. 57-58). Cross training from service toskilled maintenance or technical positions is virtually unknown (O'Cleireacain,5467; McKinney, 5481). Business office clericals do not transfer into skilledmaintenance positions (IUOE Br. 42). Nor are skilled maintenance employeesbeing cross-trained into other job groups (Stickler, Chi I 9, 35-37). Thefew examples of individuals having interchange of functions (emergencytechnician starting IVs, RNs doing work after daytime hours normally performedby respiratory therapist or physical therapist, medical technologist trainedto watch the heart monitor while RN is on break_Houston, 4026-27, 4042)are very limited. Evidence does show that separate RN units are compatiblewith limited interchange of function (ANA Br. 153, citing Houston, 4040.)There is no evidence to support the industry's general claim that cross-traininghas been inhibited by collective bargaining in separate units (ANA Br.151; IUOE Br. 45; Stickler, 45-49). The suggestion (Comment 142, St. Anthony'sHealth Corp.) that use of multi-competent workers would be hurt by turfbattles between professional groups, separate bargaining unit designations,and existing legal restrictions on practice patterns is speculative andis undercut by finding that most multi-competent workers are within oneunit_the technical unit. Any problems raised by legal restrictions suchas licensure requirements do not derive from the Board's proposal to allowmultiple units. Industry testimony on interchange of functions betweenprofessionals and non-professionals (Donnelly, 4073-74; AHA Br. 11) isnot relevant because the Act would not permit a unit combining professionalswith non-professionals, absent a self-determination election by the professionals.Countering the claim of increasing integration of health care employeesis evidence of increasing fragmentation as a result of greater sophisticationof work, decrease in the full time equivalent work force and rise in part-timeand temporary jobs, increase in the use of subcontracting, growing gapsbetween patient care and non-patient care jobs (such as business officeclericals), and growing gaps between RNs and other professionals becauseof the RN shortage (WS Schoen). 2. <T3>Proliferation, strikes, jurisdictional disputes, and wage whipsawing.</T3>There is little if any evidence that multiple units in the healthcare industry have resulted in any of the problems perceived to arise fromproliferation such as strikes, jurisdictional disputes, and wage whipsawing.First, the record shows that most hospitals that are organized have fewunits (Robfogel, Chi II 223; Comer, Chi II 329; Cammarata, 4424-4425).Logically, the potential for a number of units does not mean that everyhospital will be faced with this number of organizing campaigns. Indeed,a successful organizing effort of one unit in a hospital does not appearto have had a ripple effect on further organization (Gilmore, 4894; Splain,5252-53; IUOE Br. 69-70). Statistics over the last ten years show littleorganizing in residual units. Health care workers organize no more frequentlyin facilities where some workers are already engaging in collective bargainingthan in facilities where no employees are represented (WS Splain at 14-17).A vast number of organized hospitals have only one unit (WS Schwarz atTable 1 andamp; 264; Sockell, 4520; Shea, 5163). AFL analysis of all hospitalcontract renewal notices received by the FMCS from hospitals from 1983to 1987 shows that 55% of all organized hospitals are party to only onecollective-bargaining agreement; almost 80% negotiate no more than twocontracts; and almost 90% negotiate no more than three contracts (AFL Exh.5 p. 1). In an SEIU survey of 200 private hospitals, 74% have 3 or fewerbargaining units (WS Shea, SEIU, Table 2). Evidence shows that, with the exception of New York State, where pre-1974practice was to permit each employee group to have its own unit, recognitionof RN-only units has not led to organizing efforts by other professionals(King, Chi II 38: In Ohio there is only one unit in which professionalsother than RNs are represented separately; Gilmore, 4894: No hospital representedby Maine State Nurses' Association has another professional unit in additionto RN unit). Existence of a physicians' unit is rare; some states, likeTexas, do not permit physicians to be employees of health care facilities(IUOE Br. 64, 99; see section VI, Physicians, <T3>infra</T3>). There is no evidence that the existence of a separateskilled maintenance unit has led to the organization of other units (IUOEBr. 62-65 and section IX, Skilled Maintenance, <T3>infra</T3>). Some witnesses' statements that multiple units lead to strikes, jurisdictionaldisputes, and wage whipsawing were, for the most part, general and speculative,and not supported by examples. See, for example, Graumann, 397, 409; Dauner,3199; Corbett, 3369; Emanuel, 3503-04; Weinrich, 4254, 4256; Cammarata,4403, 4405-06. The industry did not submit data with respect to the degreeof organization, number of organized units per hospital, or incidence ofstrikes or sympathy strikes, nor evidence that a particular type of unithas proven to be strike prone (AFL Br. 118-19). In fact, the evidence submitted by unions shows there is a low incidenceof strike activity in the health care industry; the rate is lower thanin other industries (IUOE Br. 75; NLRB Exh. 1; AFL Exh. 6). The ANA hada voluntary no-strike policy until 1968 (Shepard, 4931-32). The CaliforniaNurses' Association (CNA) offers binding arbitration (WS Absalom at 16).According to available data, only 3.3% of all contract negotiations, includingnurse bargaining, resulted in strikes. From 1984-1987, strikes in the healthcare industry occurred substantially less often than in all other industries(FMCS data reprinted in WS Schoen at 28 and AFL Exh. 6). The minimal levelof strike activity is confirmed by studies done by several health careunions. Since 1938, SEIU has had a strike incidence of 1.4% in over 2700hospital contracts (WS Shea at 10). Of over 1,000 hospital contracts negotiatedsince 1975 by the NUHHCE, only 43 involved strikes (Muehlenkamp, 4776).IUOE, which represents almost 300 hospital bargaining units, has had only25 strikes in its history (IUOE revised Exh. 2). Industry witnesses who testified about collective bargaining experiencesin the industry confirmed the infrequency of strikes (Comer, Chi II 320;Corbett, 3374-75; Henry, 3026, 3062, 3085-86). Indeed, Kaiser specificallystated that its observation that there is a greater likelihood of workstoppages in facilities with multiple units was limited to craft-specificunits, not the broader, traditional unit groupings (Comment 311). The industry'sclaim that the Board should discount the lack of strike activity in professionalunits because few facilities have multiple units supports our finding thatin fact few facilities have multiple units. One study showed there is generally no correlation between the number ofunits in a hospital and the frequency of strikes (AFL Br. 118, fn citingFMCS study). Other evidence suggests, however, that the likelihood of strikesdecreases as the number of units in a hospital increases (IUOE Exh. 2 revised).Strikes also tend to occur more frequently in units with more employeesthan in smaller units (AFL Exh. 5). For example, only 16.4% of hospitalcontracts covered 300 or more employees, yet these units account for 45.5%of all strikes, while 51.52% of all hospital contracts covered 100 or feweremployees, but accounted for only 17.7% of all strikes. The average sizeof a striking unit in the 1984-87 period was three times the size of anon-striking unit. (AFL Exh. 5 citing FMCS data.) See also WS Shea at 11-12with similar variation in size of striking SEIU units. Strikes in broaderunits have the greatest impact on health care. Strikes in New York Cityby Local 1199 encompassing many worker classifications including otherprofessionals, technicals, service, and clericals closed down most healthcare in the city. (Abelow, 229.) Strikes in broader units also draw ingroups of employees who, if in their own smaller unit, might have no reasonto strike (Dumpel, 3291: Strike over nurse practice issues would have noimportance to other groups of employees; Viat, 3466; Shea, 5188: Skilledmaintenance employees, technical employees enmeshed in strikes over issuesrelated to other groups of employees). The evidence shows that sympathy strikes are virtually nonexistent. No-strikeclauses in hospital contracts forbid sympathy strikes, and the patternin the industry is for covered employees to obey their contracts. (Schloop,Chi II 169; Sackman, 3585; Ahmed, 3708-09; Muehlenkamp, 4777.) We cannot accept the argument that multiple strike notices alone, evenabsent actual strikes, are disruptive, since the purpose of the noticeis to minimize possible disruptive impact by giving hospitals time to preparefor a strike. In any event, there was no showing of widespread frequencyof strike notices and no evidence that notices caused disruption in healthcare delivery. Hospitals have not generally sought common expiration dates,which would be a possible solution to recurring near strikes. (Sackman,3586; Schmidt, 3625; Willman, 4496; Muehlenkamp, 4771; Henry, 3074-75;Corbett, 3359-60; Weinrich, 4282).Some hospitals' argument that they do not have the same defensive measuresas do employers in other industries, for example, because it is difficultto replace striking professionals, is essentially an argument that hospitalemployees not be allowed to exercise their statutory right to strike. Therecord does not show in any event that they engage in strikes frequently.Industry's general claim (AHA Br. 26-27) that multiple units will inevitablyresult in jurisdictional disputes is not supported by the record. The recordshows a low frequency of jurisdictional disputes in hospitals and no correlationbetween the occurrence of disputes and the number of units. Jurisdictionalissues that have arisen are often resolved on an informal basis withoutresorting to arbitration (Absalom, 3282-83; Sackman, 3585; Schmidt, 3625;Viat, 3471; IUOE Br. 78-79). There was no record evidence of jurisdictionaldisputes in hospitals between units of professional employees (Emanuel,3503-4); such disputes are usually fought and resolved in the public arena(Absalom, 3282). Jurisdictional disputes between non-professional groupsare rare, apparently because traditional unit lines separate functionalgroupings and the unit employees do not view the other units' duties asbeing within their purview (AFL Br. 124-25). The few disputes specificallyreferred to by the industry, such as accusations of mistakes on the job,and conflict between duties of RNs and LPNs assigned by the hospital (Krasovec,413-415; Giblin, 5389-90; Graumann, 396-399, 408), encompassed disagreementsthat could arise even under all-professional and all non-professional units.The approval of an overall skilled maintenance unit, <T3>infra, </T3>should help reduce the risk of jurisdictional disputesbetween different skilled crafts. The industry failed to support its general contention (Rhodes, 13) thatmultiple units result in employees' competing for the best settlement,burdening negotiations, and inflating settlements. The record shows thatwage whipsawing and leapfrogging rarely, if ever, occur in the hospitalindustry. This is apparently the result of separate labor markets for RNs,clericals, technicals, skilled maintenance, and doctors (ANA Br. 174; AFLBr. 37-38, 59-60, 86-88, 121-22; IUOE Br. 83 citing record), and the methodof setting Medicare and Medicaid rates which limits the pass-through ofspiralling wage increases (Friedman, 5044-45). In view of the unorganizednature of the health care industry as a whole, separate unit contractstend to follow wage patterns set by non-union employers (WS Shea at 13).3. <T3>Costs. </T3>Some unions question the relevance of costs in determininghospital bargaining units. In view of Congressional concern in the healthcare amendments with the ability of health care institutions to deliveruninterrupted health services, it is relevant to consider whether multipleunits increase costs to health care institutions so as to disrupt the stabilityof the institutions. However, to the extent the industry's contention regardingcosts is an argument that employers cannot afford collective bargainingwith their employees, we note that the health care amendments were passedin response to Congress' concern with low wages and poor working conditionsin the hospital industry. <T3>Beth Israel Hospital </T3>v.<T3> NLRB, </T3>437 U.S. 483, 497 (1978). It was anticipated by Congressthat the amendments might lead to increased union organizing and bargainingwhich in turn might improve employee wages and working conditions. Costsassociated with these anticipated improvements are not relevant to theBoard's decision as to appropriate bargaining units. Some commentators claimed that multiple units would increase costs by increasingexpenses for contract negotiations, wage and benefit increases, administrationand legal fees, grievances, supervision, and accounting (Comment 62, St.Mary's Hosp.; Comment 153, Sturdy Memorial Hosp.; Comment 140, Park CityHosp.; Comment 130, St. Vincent's Hosp., Birmingham; Comment 224, St. Luke's/Roosevelt;Comment 311, Hosp. Council of Southern Calif.). There was no empiricalor specific evidence showing comparative labor costs in hospitals withdifferent numbers of units. For example, one witness stated that facilitiesin Ohio with three or more units devoted more time and resources to collectivebargaining than hospitals with fewer units, but had no specific examples(Weimer, Chi II 7, 65-66, 77-79). Another industry witness testified generallythat increased costs were associated with negotiating in multiple unitsin Pennsylvania, but gave no specifics (Cammarata, Hosp. Council of W.Pa., 4392-4430). In fact, studies have found minimal cost impact, 3%-5%,of labor unions on hospital costs. This rate is low when contrasted withthe overall rate of health care cost inflation (WS Schoen at 31). The examplerelating to the costs for negotiations at a public hospital in Massachusettswith eight bargaining units (Robfogel, Chi II 222-23, 228, where out-of-stateas well as local attorneys appeared for each negotiating session) was notshown to be typical. The industry contends that small hospitals are particularly vulnerableto increased costs and cannot afford the money and staff resources neededfor dealing with multiple units. However, we were not provided with empiricaldata for comparison. We note also that few health care facilities havemore than two or three units. The industry's claim that hospitals generally treat each bargaining unitas a separate cost accounting center, thereby adding to the complexityof operating a hospital, is unsupported in the record (Dauner, 3233-34),and in any event is irrelevant. One witness claimed that multiple units would limit an employer's abilityto secure significant cost reductions in employee benefits available nowby marketing large groups of employees to third party providers and thatthe cost of administering multiple employee benefit plans is higher. Nospecific examples were cited of increased costs (Cammarata, 4402-03). Moreover,benefits may be negotiated across-the-board even in multiple units (Jacquin,5366-68).The claim by some that multiple units will result in limiting opportunitiesfor job advancement and security are not supported by the record; neitheris the claim that multiple units hamper affirmative action because departmentalseniority and separate bargaining deter hiring and career development.To the contrary, there is record evidence (set forth in Sec. V, RegisteredNurses and other sections), that there is limited career movement in hospitalsregardless of whether or not the hospital is organized because promotions,layoffs, etc. are done by department and because of the distinct skillsand education of the various groups of employees which restrict interchangeand mobility. There is also evidence that in organized facilities, unionshave sought career ladders, training, and upgrading, and have not actedto limit movement among workers. (WS Schoen at 15; Supplemental Statementof Schoen.) Some employers argue that multiple contracts limit their flexibility injob assignments, scheduling, and performance evaluation. This appears tobe an argument that the industry does not wish to have to bargain sincebargaining limits the employer's flexibility. However, the statute givesemployees the right to bargain for more favorable terms of employment,and employers have the opportunity at the bargaining table to seek termsgiving them flexibility. Arguments that multiple contracts will result in confusion for managementas to which contract covers which employees (Comment 104, St. Francis Hosp.,Hartford), that it would be hard for employees to understand and deal withmany units (Comment 51, O'Bleness Memorial Hosp.), and that multiple unitswork against cohesiveness among smaller groups like business office clericals(Comment 138, Rice Memorial Hosp.) were not supported by specific examples.Finally, the record demonstrates some countervailing considerations toany increased costs as a result of multiple units. At least some of theadministrative costs of unit determinations come from the hospitals' oppositionto organizing. In 1981 Congress banned the use of Medicare funds for anti-unionconsultants on estimates that this activity cost $30 million dollars ayear (WS Shea at 15, citing Medicare Manual). There are presently industrycosts for prolonged hearings and appeals in many units, which we are confidentrulemaking will substantially reduce. Bargaining in large units may prolongnegotiations and increase costs as employees are involved who would otherwisehave no interest in certain demands (WS Shea at 15). Employers can faceincreased costs even if there is only one unit, since there may be separatenegotiations for different major employee classifications (Owley, 4375-76)or separate contract provisions (Emanuel, 3499-3501). Costs might be containedby combining separate units for bargaining purposes or having common expirationdates for contracts, but the record shows lack of employer support forsuch union proposals (See Sec. IV(B)(2), <T3>supra</T3>). C. Broad Units Militate Against Health Care Employees, Organizing and Bargaining,Contrary to Congress' Intent 1. <T3>The impact of broad units on organizing and bargaining is a relevantconsideration. </T3>As shown above, Congress passed the health care amendments,in part, to improve conditions for health care industry employees by extendingto them the rights of the National Labor Relations Act which permits organizingand collective bargaining. <T3>Masonic Hall </T3>v.<T3> N.L.R.B., supra, </T3>699 F.2d at 634. While, as the industry correctlycontends, the extent of union organization cannot be controlling in unitdeterminations, it is a factor, and in view of Congress' concerns, theability of health care employees to organize and bargain is an importantconsideration in determining whether more than two units are appropriatein the industry. 2. <T3>Historically, health care workers organize and engage in initial bargainingin occupationally homogeneous units. </T3>The evidence shows that broadunits militate against organizing by health care workers (AFL Exh. 4, AHAReport on Union Activity in the Health Care Industry). Although there wereexamples of broad-based bargaining, particularly in New York City, therecord shows that organizing and initial bargaining among health care workershas historically been by occupationally-homogeneous units (AFL AppendixA; WS Shea, Table 1, SEIU Survey; and section V, Registered Nurses; sectionVI, Physicians; and section VII, Other Professionals). For example, inthe AFL survey of all private sector hospitals in which an AFL affiliatehas organized one or more units, there were 920 homogeneous non-professionalunits, and only 104 heterogeneous units (AFL Br. Appendix A). The ANA constituentstate nurses' associations represent 363 all-RN bargaining units; only4 all-professional units were organized before <T3>St. Francis II </T3>(Comment 240, ANA, Stull Affidavit). Evidence preparedby the industry confirmed that occupationally diverse bargaining unitsare found only in a minority of contracts (AFL Exh. 1, [Hospital IndustrialRelations Information Services, p. 5]). The industry contends that unions have requested or agreed to all-professionaland all non-professional units, have successfully organized and bargainedin these units, and that therefore a Board decision to find appropriateonly two broad units (plus guards) would not negatively impact on organizingand bargaining. The record shows that most union requests for broad-basedunits occurred after <T3>St. Francis II, </T3>at a time when the Board would have rejected mostoccupationally-homogeneous units. Broad bargaining, where it does occur,appears to develop over time, after individual employee unit concerns areaddressed and the bargaining relationship has matured (WS Shea at 8; WSPastreich; Friedman, 5046). Even then, the record shows that employersmay meet separately with one or more subunits on their concerns and thatthere may be separate contract provisions for different concerns. See <T3>e.g. </T3>section VIII, Technicals; section X, Business Office Clericals.Thus, in New York City, where Local 1199 engages in citywide bargainingwith the League of Voluntary Hospitals on behalf of its Professional, Technical,and Clerical Division (professionals other than RNs), Hospital Division(service and maintenance employees) and Drug Division (pharmacists, socialworkers, therapists), the individual units in these divisions were separatelyorganized and negotiated their first contracts separately; joint bargainingof these divisions developed over twenty years (Olson, 4694-4700, 4706,4716-19; Ratner, 3710, 3725-33, 3738). Proposals are submitted by eachseparate division; each classification has at least one representativeat the bargaining table; and there are local negotiations for specificissues at some hospitals after the master negotiations (Ratner, 3739, 3742,3757-59; Olson, 4702; Muehlenkamp, 4782). At Michael Reese Hospital, theservice and maintenance unit and the business office clerical unit bargainjointly but have separate committees, contracts, and stewards (WS Gray).There is no evidence of a trend toward coordinated bargaining (Shea, 5217-18).In New York City, there has been some movement away from the citywide approachof Local 1199; there is pressure to go back to each hospital after themaster agreement to get separate provisions on local issues (Ratner, 3739).Although some industry commentators now request broad-based units, thereare a number of instances in the record in which employers sought, forexample, to have RNs in a broad unit with other professionals, and thenraised the question of effectiveness of bargaining representation, or appropriatenessof unit. See section V, Registered Nurses, <T3>infra. </T3>To the extent that employees represented in different unitsmay wish a number of years later to re-group as a single larger entityfor purposes of conducting negotiations, nothing in the rule would interfere.In sum, the record fails to demonstrate that finding a limited number ofoccupationally-homogeneous units to be appropriate would inhibit functionalintegration on the job, increase strikes, jurisdictional disputes, or wagewhipsawing, or substantially increase costs to industry or to workers.Rather, we believe that finding only two broad units appropriate wouldunduly hamper organizing and effective bargaining, and would not carryout Congress' intent in the health care industry. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Registered Nurses </ITAG>A. Introduction In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Board tentatively determinedthat RNs constituted a separate appropriate bargaining unit in acute carehospitals having more than 100 beds. 52 FR 25146. Among the reasons assignedwere that RNs: (a) Work around the clock, 7 days a week; (b) Have constant responsibility for direct patient care; (c) Are subject to common supervision by other nurses; (d) Share similar education, training, experience and licensing not sharedby other employees; (e) Have the most contact with other RNs; and (f) Have a lengthy history of separate organization and bargaining. Much of the evidence taken at the rulemaking hearings concerned the RNclassification. As discussed in more detail <T3>infra, </T3>we have decided not to differentiate between hospitalshaving more than 100 beds and those having fewer. However, in other respects,after carefully considering the evidence amassed, we have determined thatRNs appropriately constitute a separate bargaining unit.B. The Record Supports a Finding That RNs Constitute a Separate AppropriateUnit 1. <T3>Work schedules. </T3>There was some evidence of selected other professionalswho, at certain hospitals, might be scheduled to work evening and nighttimeshifts (Comment 72, McCarthy; Comment 82, Humana). However, the evidencewas overwhelming that only RNs have a professional responsibility whichrequires them as a group to be on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (Chow,3107-08; Ballard, 55; Schauer, 3155; Ratner, 3735; Graham, 4841-42). Theyare the only professionals regularly required to work overtime, includingas much as two 8- or 12-hour shifts (Bachus, Chi I 144; Wilson, 5074, 5091).2. <T3>Responsibilities. </T3>Each professional classification obviously possessesits own singular job function and responsibility. However, whereas otherprofessionals specialize, and have intermittent contact with patients,nurses are unique in that their profession demands continuous interactionwith patients (Dumpel, 3277-78; Chow, 3108; Ballard, 55, 57-58, WS at 7;Foley, 446). Nursing practice involves the nursing process by which nursesassess patients, as reflected in the nursing practice acts (Comment 240,ANA, Kalisch; WS Foley at 4; WS Ballard at 9-10). RNs continually monitorall patients to be sure that physicians' orders are being carried out andthat treatment procedures are not proving harmful (Ballard, 55-56; Bullough,4627-30). RNs must be alert for errors made by other professionals; forexample, if another professional, e.g. a pharmacist, dispenses medicationin an improper dosage, the overall responsibility rests with the RN who,if she administers it, is also responsible (Reierson, 3606-07; Sackman,3586). The RNs' special responsibility is based on a cluster of knowledgewhich they possess, as opposed to a single skill (Bullough, 4629-30). One1982 study by Posavac showed that the ``perception of nursing care is thesingle most crucial aspect in the overall rating of hospitals by patients''(Fine, 3143). 3. <T3>Supervision. </T3>All acute care facilities have an organized departmentof nursing, and that department is supervised by a nurse (Ballard, 52-53).For this reason, the vast majority of nurses in hospitals are ultimatelyresponsible to the director of nursing (Ballard, 67; Lipari, 3703; Gilmore,4909-10; Comment 293(b), Jones: 3 RNs out of 99 not in nursing department;Comment 293(g), Soltis: 11 out of 200 not in nursing department). The evidencedid indicate that in some instances nurses work in departments other thannursing and are subject to supervision by these other departments, suchas ambulatory services, discharge planning, home health care, and anesthesiology(Graybill, 4149; Comment 139, S. Baltimore Hospital). However, even inthe few instances where a nurse might be hired into another departmentand report to someone other than the director of nursing, the directorof nursing is still responsible for the delivery of nursing care (Ballard,67-68; Indelicato, 3680). Product line management is a system of organization by type of serviceand in response to the DRG method of payment (Dalstrom, 332; Houston, 4024;Kennedy, 5552). It is argued that, with this type of structure, nurseshave more in common with those in their product line than with other RNswith whom they have little contact (Dalstrom, 336-339). Ordinarily however,it results in some RNs' being responsible to a functional manager of aproject and to nursing heads for clinical issues (Comment 293(i), Feldsine,at 2-3). Product line management is a financial tool; it does not resultin changes in interaction among hospital workers (Kennedy, WS at 6-7).As noted <T3>supra, </T3>nurses overwhelmingly continue to report to nurses (Dalstrom,335: Only 10% of RNs not members of nursing division, but no showing thatnot supervised by an RN). 4. <T3>Wages. </T3>The labor market for nurses is distinct from that for otherprofessionals (Gonzalez, 4356). Thus, nurse salaries are low, even withinthe framework of hospital compensation (Corbett, 3332, 3335). There isno pressure from outside the hospital industry forcing up wages, as forexample is the case with pharmacists (ANA Br. 97). Moreover, the overwhelmingpercentage of nurses are women, and there is evidence that this has contributedto the separateness of the RN wage structure and the distinctiveness oftheir concerns (Muehlenkamp, 4779; Saporta, 5114-15). When nurses and employersbargain about wages, they look to wages of RNs at other hospitals, notat wages of other professionals (Patek, Chi I 78-79; Absalom, 3316-18).Finally, RN career ladders are very short in terms of pay, quickly levellingout after relatively brief experience (Rosen, 4671). Hospitals recognizethe separate RN market by having nurse recruiters; no similar positionexists for other professionals (Ballard, 65; Reierson, 3608-09).Nurses traditionally conduct wage negotiations from these unique disadvantagesdespite the demand for their services (ANA Br. 99). In fact an employermay insist on a separate wage scale for RNs in an all-professional unit(Comment 51, Castrop: employer re-opened wall-to-wall contract at O'Blenessto increase RN wages only). 5. <T3>Wage whipsawing or leapfrogging. </T3>The record evidence based onactual experience shows that wage leapfrogging has not occurred in thehospital industry (Ratner, Local 1199, 3744; Friedman, Local 1199, 5041,5045; Absalom, CNA, 3316-3317; Muehlenkamp, NUHHCE, 4775; Twomey, WS at6, Hosp and Prof Allied Employees of NJ; Schmidt, Oregon Federation ofNurses, AFT, WS at 4; Shea, SEIU, WS at 13-14). The one example offeredby the industry as evidence of leapfrogging (involving RNs) occurred 20years ago in California and concerned the adjustment of wages for RNs whohad been underpaid for a long period of time as compared to other hospitalemployees (as found by a fact-finding panel appointed by the governor).Even this adjustment did not result in any disruption of patient care.Moreover, other professionals did not obtain higher wages or benefits thereafteras a result of the RN unit adjustment (WS Absalom, at 7-8; 3286-87). The fact that RNs are in a different labor market mitigates against leapfrogging(Shepard, 4959-60). Special considerations such as the nursing shortage,recruitment, and retention are not concerns of other professions and havenot been carried over into other units (Absalom, 3316-3318). In addition,there are certain limitations or rigidities in the financing system whichpreclude the pass-through of spiraling wage increases. A significant limitationis found in the Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. These ratesplay a prominent role in the economics of hospitals, and are set in a regionalarea in accordance with the general wage pattern set by the most influentiallocal union and its employers. Thus, there is little incentive for unionsto engage in whipsaw strikes and efforts to leapfrog the pattern of wageincreases. (Friedman, 5044-45.) Finally, it appears that concern aboutthe potential for leapfrogging could be ameliorated by uniform contractexpiration dates. However, the evidence shows that hospitals have declinedto accept union proposals to this end. (Henry, 3074-76; Absalom, 3318-19;Sackman, 3586; Willman, 4480-82; Clark, 4685.) 6. <T3>Education, training, experience and licensing. </T3>All professionsrequire specialized education and training (AHA Br. 15; Mixon, Chi II 274),and are subject to prescribed standards of practice (California HealthAnd Safety Code Sec., cited in AHA Br. 15; Comment 248, Cedars-Sinai MedicalCenter). However, in addition, nurses must pass state licensing exams,which are uniform throughout the country, after graduating from an accreditednursing school. A candidate who passes the exam is competent to practicethroughout the country. (Reierson, 3597.) Nurses are required to follow,inter alia, state nurse practice acts, and no other health care workermay function as a nurse under nurse practice acts (Ballard, 56, 57). RNs' licensing requirements may actually conflict with the requirementsand practices of other professions. For example, as previously indicated,RNs fill out incident reports on mistakes in medication dosages made byother workers (Reierson, 3603; Sackman, 3586). This type of responsibilitymay result in antagonism between the RNs and other professionals whichmight impede collective bargaining by the professionals as a group. Several states mandate continuing education for nurse relicensure. Onlysocial workers and pharmacists are subject to such requirements in morestates than RNs. (ANA Br. 48; Ballard, 54; Lumpkin, 87.) 7. <T3>Interaction. </T3>RNs work in close and continuous contact with oneanother within the same hospital (WS Foley; Owley, 4377-78). Moreover,sometimes RNs at different hospitals have more contact with one anotherthan with the other professionals in their own institutions (Owley, 4378;Schauer, 3156-58). With respect to RNs' interaction with non-nurse professionals,while there is some contact, it is not regular and recurring. There area variety of factors which help to explain why interaction among RNs andnon-nurse professionals is limited. For one thing, while there was testimonythat there is a crossover of duties between RNs and other professionals(Thompson, Chi II 55-58), there was also testimony that licensing and otherregulations clearly prevent RNs from doing much of the work of other professionalsand other professionals from doing RN work (Lipari, 3702; WS Dumpel andamp;3279). Moreover, non-nurse professionals generally are located away frompatient units where RNs are located. For example, in Local 1199-organizedhospitals, most pharmacists are located in self-contained units, usuallyin the hospitals' basements. (Crisafulli, 3712-14.) Moreover, RNs typicallyhave different working hours (Indelicato, 3681; Ahmed, 3707). As notedby the ANA, the contact RNs may have with respiratory therapists is notmaterial since respiratory therapists consistently have been found to benon-professionals. See for example <T3>Samaritan Health Services, </T3>238 NLRB 629, 638 (1978); <T3>Barnert Memorial Hospital Center, </T3>217 NLRB 775, 779 (1975). The point is made that RNs in many cases have more frequent contact withother professions than those other professions that the Board proposesto place together have among themselves (AHA Br. 20-21, citing <T3>Long Island Hospital, </T3>256 NLRB 202 (1981), and other Board cases).However, this point militates more against grouping of the different professionalsthan it does toward grouping the RNs with other professionals. 8. <T3>The team concept. </T3>Much evidence was offered during the proceedingconcerning the team concept. See also section IV (B)(1), <T3>supra. </T3>After carefully considering this evidence and the parties'arguments in connection therewith, we conclude that the fact that somehospitals utilize the team concept does not detract from the separate appropriatenessof RN units. There are two types of teams found in hospitals. The first is the nursingteam which consists of RNs, LPNs, and aides. This type of team is foundthroughout the industry. However, as this team contains only nurses andnon-professionals, and the Act provides that professionals are entitledto a separate unit if they choose, the nursing team is not relevant tothe issue presented.The second type is the multidisciplinary team which contains various classificationsof professionals and non-professionals and has been utilized in the healthcare industry since the early 1900's. Employers unsuccessfully relied onthe existence of teams in an attempt to defeat the 1974 Amendments. (ANABr. 126, citing Ohio Hospital Association testimony.) The team conceptremains non-persuasive for several reasons. First, the evidence at thehearing established that many hospitals do not even use the team concept(e.g., McCullough 4819; Gilmore 4910). Moreover, except for some specializedhospitals, e.g., children's hospitals (Sokatch 4194, 4199; Gallagher, 3539,3543-46), those hospitals with teams often have no more than six or seventeams (Thompson, Chi II 14-15; Mixon, Chi II 294-96; Graybill 4172-86;Comment 283, Leavenworth), with two to eight members on a team (Thompson,Chi II 72; Mixon, Chi II 277; Gallagher, 3543-45). Thus, within the limitednumber of hospitals that use teams, only a minority of nurses and otherprofessionals participate on the teams (Bachus, Chi I 129-132, most teamsare on the management level). Although one comment stated generally thatthe downsizing of staff has led to more teamwork (Comment 263, HuntsvilleMem. Hosp), this was not supported by other specific examples. While members of teams may have daily interaction and weekly formal meetings(Comment 78, Greater Cincinnati; Comment 288, Graybill, Children's MedicalCenter, Akron), there was also testimony that the interaction of RNs andother professionals is limited in certain ways. For example, team membersonly interact with the few other members on their teams. Additionally,other duties of RNs may prevent or limit their actual participation inan assigned team program (Schmidt, 3627, 3635; Bachus, Chi I 129-130; Reierson,3609-10). More importantly, the fact that the RNs may interact and workwith other professionals on teams does not alter the separateness of theiridentity. The team approach is a process to ensure that the elements ofpatient care are organized. The evidence was uncontradicted that it doesnot alter each licensed professional's responsibility for his or her individualscope of practice. (Ballard, 56; Twomey, 131; Wilson, 5095; Bachus, ChiI 129-130.) Nor does participation by some RNs in team care affect wages,hours, benefits, training, skills, or functions of RNs on or off the teams(Graybill, 4174-75; Houston, 4044-45). Conversely, separate RN units were not shown to have interfered with teamcare (Gallagher, City of Hope, 3540; Bullough, 4651 and 4653; Houston,Sacred Heart, 4031, 4038, 4048). The industry offered only unsubstantiatedspeculation that team care would be adversely affected; e.g., one witnesstestified that the amount of interplay, the exchange that goes on minute-to-minutein critical situations, could be damaged significantly (4185-86). However,at City of Hope, a specialized cancer hospital with a large number of teamsand a separate RN unit, the teams remained able to deliver a very highlevel and quality of care. (Gallagher, 3540 andamp; 3543; Bullough, 4653.See also Thompson, Chi II 9, 86-87: no evidence that separate RN representationat her Ohio hospital has made nurses less able to function as a team.)9. <T3>Cross-training and interchange. </T3>Because of licensure limitations,cross-training does not take place between RNs and other employees (Lipari,3702; Dumpel, WS andamp; 3279). Hospital codes also preclude replacementof RNs by other professionals (Rosen, 4666). It logically follows thatthe extent of interchange between RNs and other non-nursing professionalsis limited not only because of RN licensing limitations but also becauseof the licensing requirements of other professional employees. There wastestimony that RNs will perform functions of other ``professionals'' whenthe latter are not available, e.g., moving patients instead of physicaltherapists, or doing respiratory therapist work at night and on weekends(Comment 78, Greater Cincinnati; Comment 198, Marshalltown Medical Center).With respect to the first example, the performance of non-professionaltasks such as transferring patients to wheelchairs is not relevant to interchangebetween professionals. Similarly, respiratory therapists consistently havebeen held by the Board to be non-professionals. Finally, other examplesof interchange, such as medical technologists' watching the heart monitorwhile a nurse is on break (Houston, 4041-42, 4026-27), appear to be minimal.It was also stated that both pharmacists and RNs dispense drugs and medications;however, pharmacists typically formulate medications and advise on propermedications while RNs administer them (Thompson, Chi II 55-58). 10. <T3>History of representation and collective bargaining. </T3>The ANA,representing RNs, stated that the RNs' desire to be organized to protecttheir interests as well as their patients' interests  began nearly 100years ago, and persisted through the onset of collective bargaining andthe original Taft-Hartley exclusion of employees of non-profit hospitalsfrom federal labor law (ANA p. 74; see Comment 240, attachment, Kalisch,Twelve Key Steps in the Process of Professionalization of American Nursing,1854-1987; Comment 293, ANA, Flanagan). AHA contends that separate bargainingby RNs does not reflect a freely established pattern because, prior tothe 1974 amendments, it was to some degree based upon considerations ofthe then-current law in each state and because collective bargaining primarilyexisted only in a few isolated parts of the country and thus could notbe deemed representative. Moreover, the AHA contends, subsequent to the1974 amendments such bargaining was established pursuant to the directionof the Board. Regardless of what might first have provided the impetus, RNs have formany years exhibited a strong desire for separate representation. Evenduring the period following <T3>St. Francis II, </T3>RNs consistently sought separate RN units butwere forced to organize into units with other professionals or face lengthy,costly, and fruitless litigation (Saporta, 5127-28; Splain, 5273-74; Muehlenkamp,4764-67; Wilson 5069). Although forced to include other professionals,the organizing drives were strikingly similar to prior nurses-only campaigns.Testimony indicates that the campaigns were led by nurses, issues promptingorganization were nurses' issues, and the bargaining was performed by nurses,often with no participation by other hospital professionals. (Gonzalez4356; Splain, 5293; Lumpkin, 99-100; Patek, Chi I 54-55; Chow, 3108; McCullough,4811; Gilmore, 4894; Shepard, 4927.) Moreover, comments from a number ofhospitals indicated they have not had problems bargaining with separateRN units (Comment 79, Baptist Hospital; Comment 105, Mass. Hosp. Assn:2 examples; Comment 121, Central Michigan).The AHA makes the point that the more recent history of collective bargainingshows that all-professional units nonetheless are viable, and the recordoffers some support for this position. Thus, even some RN-only unit proponentshave testified that the interests of all professional groups have beenadequately represented in bargaining for an all professional unit.\21\<NOTE/> (AHA Br. 24.) However, while bargaining could undoubtedlyproceed in any one of a number of configurations, this does not necessarilyanswer the question whether a separate unit of RNs might not also be appropriate;or better reflect the wishes, needs and interests of RNs, other professionals,and perhaps even health care providers themselves. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ That other professionals have not filed unfair laborpractice charges or grievances against unions where nurses predominate,charging breach of duty of fair representation, does not mean other professionalsare satisfied with representation. A breach of the duty of fair representationis found only where conduct is arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith.<T3>Vaca v. Sipes, </T3>386 U.S. 171, 190 (1967). The testimony shows that not only have the RNs desired separate representation(Saporta, 5127-28; Splain, 5273-74; Muehlenkamp, 4764-67; Wilson, 5069),but other professionals do not appear to react favorably to their inclusionwith RNs. As noted <T3>supra, </T3>the other professionals often do not participate in theorganizing campaigns and are hostile to being included in bargaining unitswith RNs. As an example, when Capitol Hill Hospital demanded inclusionof other professionals, the other professionals complained, became hostile,and some even requested separation (Gonzalez, 4351-53). In Langlade MemorialHospital, Wisconsin, other professionals forced into a unit with RNs triedto decertify the union but were outvoted by the RNs (Owley, 4376). The main concern of the non-nursing professionals is of being overwhelmedby the large number of nurses and not having their concerns given priority.RNs are the largest professional group in any hospital. In fact, RNs constituteapproximately 23% of the hospital workforce (WS Schoen, Table 1, citingdata from AHA publication and BLS Hospital Wage Survey.) They may outnumberother professionals by a ratio of 4 to 1 or more. (AFL Br. 92; Twomey,123-125, 128-129; Gafni, 133-135; Thompson, Chi II 58.) The non-nurse professionalsare also concerned that RNs could ignore their interests when they conflictwith RNs' (Comment 134, American Physical Therapists Assn). A number ofnon-nursing professionals who testified at the hearings confirmed the lackof interest which RNs exhibited toward their circumstances, and the factthat, despite their different professions, they were able to achieve collectivebargaining in all-professional units, excluding RNs and physicians. Seesection VII, Other Professionals, <T3>infra. </T3>Evidence showed that even when made part of a unit whichwins an election, other professionals sometimes do not participate in negotiationsor come to union meetings (Schauer, 3154; Wilson, 5070; Patek, Chi I 54,55-67 and WS 6-7). Issues discussed during bargaining tend to be thoseof interest to nurses (Wilson, 5073). Moreover, most grievances at onehospital were from nurses on nurse issues (Bachus, Chi I 122). There isa concern that if forced into units with RNs and RNs do not want representation,other professionals would not have enough votes to obtain representation(Owley 4376-77; Ahmed, 3707-08). The AHA argues that the size of the RNs' group relative to other professionalsshould not be a consideration in determining whether to have an all-inclusiveunit, and that this is a clear departure from the Board's general unitdetermination analysis in which the Board routinely has included smallancillary groups in units with one or more large classifications that constitutethe bulk of the unit. We acknowledge that units frequently are an amalgamof other special interest categories. See, e.g., <T3>Airco, </T3>273 NLRB 348 (1984). Nonetheless, the Board routinely alsofinds appropriate separate groups whose interests have been shown to besufficiently distinctive. See, e.g., <T3>Pacesetter Corp., </T3>241 NLRB 1150 (1979) (separate unit of over-the-roaddrivers found appropriate); <T3>Newburgh Mfg. Co., </T3>151 NLRB 762 (1965) (separate unit of garmentcutters found appropriate.) Some employers argued that the real reason unions want separate RN unitsis that their constitution and by-laws do not permit them to organize otherprofessionals (Comment 306, Herrin). However there was testimony that somenurses' associations have amended their by-laws to allow organization andrepresentation of other professionals (Gonzalez, 4362; Sackman, 3578).In addition, there was testimony that some employers' true concern withallowing separate RN units is not unit fragmentation but defeating unions.Several witnesses testified that their employer demanded inclusion of otherprofessionals with nurses when nurses wanted separate representation, butthen told the RNs they should not include other professionals who did nothave their interests. These same employers told the other professionalsthat they should vote against the ``nurses' '' union because they wouldbe a minority and nurses could not adequately represent them, thus contradictingthe argument of many employers in this proceeding. (Gonzalez, Capitol HillHospital, 4351-53; Gilmore, 4896-97; Absalom, 3315; Saporta, 5134, Sackman,3580-84; WS Splain at 18-19; Wilson, 5096-97.) Employers have also requestedthe inclusion of lab technicians with RNs, then challenged their inclusion(Wilson, 5087-89). In several instances, employers who earlier had insisted on the inclusionof all professionals later opposed bargaining with the RNs and other professionalsin a single unit when the nurses' union was selected as bargaining representativeof an all-professional unit. For example, after the D.C. Nurses Associationwon an election in a broader unit demanded by the employer, the employerat negotiations proposed removal of non-RNs from the agreement, sayingits earlier position had been based on ``tactics.'' (Gonzalez, CapitolHill Hospital, 4355; see also Lumpkin, Shands Hospital, 95: hospital askedto amend unit to separate RNs from non-RNs; because of problems with recruitingand retaining RNs, the employer needed to set innovative scheduling, overtimepay for shifts, premiun pay.) 11. <T3>Collective bargaining interests. </T3>There are a number of issuesof unique concern to nurses in collective bargaining (See Comment 240(b),submission of David Martin, RN, ANA senior staff specialist for labor relations,affidavit analyzing 190 RN-only unit contracts representing nearly everysuch contract negotiated in 1986). While there may be examples of how specialconcerns of the RNs have been addressed in all-professional units, thisdoes not necessarily demonstrate that RNs and other professionals havelarge numbers of common interests. Nurses can emphasize these issues inbargaining regardless of the concerns of non-RN professionals because RNswould constitute 80% or more in a typical unit (WS Shea at 22), and often100% of those willing to participate in bargaining (Gonzalez, 4355-4356).Moreover, that unions are capable of addressing special concerns of theRNs in all-professional units does not negate the fact that many of theseissues are unique to RNs and that separate representation would frequentlyprovide a more efficacious and just means for responding to their concerns.For example, RNs alone have recurring concerns with respect to floating,i.e. being temporarily transferred from one unit to another to cover understaffedunits (Schauer, 3115). RNs have bargained for mandatory orientation bothin their own unit and before floating to other units (Schauer, 3115; Comment240(b), Martin affid.: orientation provision found in 83 of 1986 contracts).Some organizations representing nurses have created ``Assignment DespiteObjection'' forms to be used when nurses are asked to work in a unit orperform a function for which they feel unprepared (Graham, 4827; Shepard,4929-31). Floating and orientation generally do not concern other hospitalprofessionals since they typically are not required to float to areas wherethey may be unqualified (Saporta, 5114; Indelicato, 3681). Moreover, otherhospital professionals are not as concerned with staffing in general becausethey do not have constant patient care responsibilities like the RNs andbecause they are not in critically short supply (Gonzalez, 4364: at CapitolHill, staffing was a major concern for RNs, not at all for other professionals).The evidence shows that scheduling issues are of much greater concern toRNs than to other non-nursing professionals. RNs are virtually alone intheir concerns with respect to mandatory overtime and double or rotatingshifts, or evening, night and weekend shifts, all of which are said toincrease the likelihood of nurse error. (Bachus, Chi I 144; Lipari, 3697;Korn 4860-61; Chow 3111, Ballard, 62, 75.) There were only isolated examplesof non-nurse professionals working late shifts or weekends. Many otherprofessionals, like social workers, work primarily day shifts during theweekdays. (Roth, 3151: no pharmacist, social worker or physical therapistat night, skeleton crew for respiratory therapy; WS Foley at 6-9: socialwork, physical therapy, doctors, offices are all closed by 6 p.m., someevenings only RNs provide primary care.) Collective-bargaining agreements have addressed these issues by, e.g.,attempting to limit mandatory overtime, rotating shifts, etc. (Comment240(b), Martin affidavit; Chow 3110-11.) Collective bargaining agreementscovering other professionals do not usually include such provisions (Friedman,5055: Local 1199 contracts for medical technologists do not prohibit mandatoryovertime). Hospitals have difficulties attracting nurses to work the less desirableevening and night shifts. Ninety-eight percent of contracts in the ANAstudy provided higher wages on evening and night shifts; 57% offer someform of alternative scheduling designed to attract RNs. (Comment 240(b),Martin affidavit.) Other professionals generally view issue of premiunpay and alternative scheduling as less important or irrelevant. This inpart is due to the fact that non-nursing professionals usually do not worknight shifts and many do not work evening shifts (Patek, Chi I 55: non-RNprofessionals had grave concerns about bargaining over premium pay forfear that this would mean that they would be required to work shifts theyhad not worked before. See also WS Lumpkin, supra at 8: re: innovativescheduling for RNs; Gilmore, 4907.) 12. <T3>Education. </T3>Nearly every surveyed contract has provisions for continuingeducation which is mandated in 15 states (Comment 240(b), Martin affidavit).Continuing education typically presents different issues for nurses, whowork around-the-clock schedules and have difficulty attending the courses,which are often given evenings, nights, or weekends. Thus, other professionalstypically bargain about continuing education by seeking more money; RNsseek time off to attend as well as tuition. (Lumpkin, 86-88; Foley, 449-450.)This in itself would not justify a separate unit as such concerns could,of course, be accommodated in larger-unit bargaining; however, they arebut one of a congery of concerns and special problems that make nursesa substantial, unique group. 13. <T3>RN bargaining units and strikes. </T3>There is testimony that therehave been many strikes by nurses (King, Chi II 41, 46, 28; Whelan, ChiII 59-61, 85; Comment 304: one-third of 20 strikes at Kaiser since 1974amendments are in RN-only units), and that some of these strikes have lastedfor a long time (e.g., Ashtabula Hospital, Ohio, 572 day strike: King,Chi II 28, 59-61). However, according to available FMCS data, only 3.3%of all health care contract negotiations, including nurse bargaining, resultedin strikes. The strike percentage in any given year never exceeded 5.1%and fell below 2% in several years. Moreover, during the 1984-1987 period,strikes in the health care industry occurred far less often than in otherindustries, 1.5% v. 2.4%. (WS Schoen at 28; AFL-CIO Exh. 6.) There was testimony that RN strikes are particularly disruptive becauseRNs constitute the largest group of hospital employees. For example, therewas a strike of 6,000 nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul in 1984 over job security(Patek, MNA, Chi I 51, 63). But there was also testimony that where strikesoccurred, the hospitals continued operation (Whelan, Chi II 59-60; Viat,3471). Moreover, we must also be mindful that in an all-professional unit,RNs, because of their predominance, could generally obtain an affirmativestrike vote even if all the other professionals were opposed. Because sucha strike would involve all professionals in the hospital, greater disruptionof hospital services would result than with a separate RN unit. (ANA Comments173.) Finally, for 18 years ANA had a no-strike policy (Shepard, 4931-32;Comment 293(k), Flanagan, <T3>Collective Bargaining and the Nursing Profession </T3>at 14-15), andCNA has adopted a standing policy that in the event of an impasse in arbitration,it will offer binding arbitration before resorting to strike action (Absalom,WS at 8-9, 12-13, 15-16 andamp; 3286-98: 1974 strike resolved by FMCS; 1978shift rotation disagreement resolved by advisory arbitration; 1980 disagreementon nursing shortage resolved by mediation-arbitration). The AHA argues that the history of the RN-only unit bargaining does notsupport a conclusion that potential work disruptions are not increasedby creation of multiple professional bargaining units, since the overwhelmingmajority of facilities where RN units exist have no other professionalunits (AHA Br. 24). However, because in all likelihood the latter phenomenonwould continue to exist, this argument is not entitled to great weight.Some commentators argued that multi-professional units may lead to sympathystrikes (Bennett, 3045; Comment 13, Corkin). However, most no-strike clausesin hospital contracts forbid sympathy work stoppages, and there was evidenceit is common for RNs to cross picket lines set up by non-nurse health careworkers (Sackman, 3585; Lipari, 3696; Korn, 4889; Roth, 3152-53). If sympathystrikes were a problem, it appears that they could be significantly reducedby mandating common expiration dates for all hospital contracts, a propositionwhich, the evidence showed, hospitals frequently or even universally haverejected (Absalom, 3318-19: Affiliated Hospitals refused to allow new expirationdate to coincide with expiration of other contracts; Clark, 4683-85: nocommon expiration dates for initial contracts; Abelow, 249-50: no pushfrom any parties to coincide RN contract expiration with master contractof League of Voluntary Hospitals; Lipari, 3697: employer opposes commonexpiration dates).14. <T3>Jurisdictional disputes. </T3>The record does not reveal a single jurisdictionaldispute between unions of professional employees (Fine, 3156-3158). Witnesseswho asserted that such jurisdictional disputes would arise did not substantiatetheir claims (Dalstrom, 339; O'Connell, 440; Dauner, 3199; Emanuel, 3503-04;WS Cammarata at 7). In fact, the most typical job duty issues involvingjurisdictional lines are between RNs and nonprofessionals, i.e., LPNs andnurses' aides (WS Shea at 14). These types of issues would arise even ifthe RNs were placed in an all-professional unit. As was the case with regard to strikes, the AHA argues that an assessmentof the impact of multiple professional units on jurisdictional disputescan only exist where there are two or more units represented by labor organizationsin a facility, and there are very few such instances (AHA Br. 24). Forthis same reason, we believe the argument that there is a potential forjurisdictional disputes among professionals where a separate RN unit isgiven, is speculative. To the extent the record deals with this matter,it shows that any issues regarding the possible overlapping duties of professionalshave in the past been fought out in the public arena. For example, attemptsby other groups to perform some of the nurses' duties under their scopeof practice in California were dealt with by the legislature. (Dumpel,3278-79.) In any event, as noted <T3>supra</T3>, (see subsection (B)(9) on cross-training and interchange),interchange of duties between professionals appears minimal. 15. <T3>Nursing shortage. </T3>It is common knowledge, and the record substantiated,that currently there is an unprecedented and severe nursing shortage (Absalom,3295; Shea, 5235; WS Schoen at 16, citing ANA Report on Hospital NursingSupply). Some hospitals have delegated some traditional RN functions, notreserved to RNs by law, to employees with no RN training. Additionally,hospitals currently have more seriously ill patients (higher acuity) thanhistorically reported. Less qualified nurses, and fewer nurses, will beforced to attend to more seriously ill patients, leading to a lower levelof care and more stress for the remaining RNs who may then opt out of nursing.(ANA Br. 101, and articles cited therein.) Nurses testified that they view collective bargaining, in their own unit,as the vehicle for improvement in their working conditions and for allowingthem a voice in patient care (Ballard, 72; Lumpkin, 85-86). Additionally,hospitals are trying innovative proposals for nurses: opening contractsfor them alone, raising wages, setting weekend differentials. Some thinkthat if other professionals are included in units with RNs, problems couldarise if such changes are also not implemented for non-nursing professionals.(Wilson, 5071; Saporta, 5116.) It has been argued that the Board should not give special considerationto a group in temporary crisis or other groups will also make demands forseparate units (Comment 65, Milford Hospital). However, while the evidenceestablishes that the situation is a serious one and appears to be growingmore serious with time (ANA Br. 100-101, and articles cited therein), weview this as only one valid factor in determining the appropriateness ofa unit limited to RNs. The concern that this will lead other professionalsto follow suit is speculative, and insufficient reason to deny RNs, whohave already established their unique concerns and a highly separate identity,a separate bargaining unit. 16. <T3>Proliferation of units. </T3>As has been documented elsewhere, theevidence in the record does not support the assumption that the recognitionof RN-only units will lead to a demand by other professional groups toorganize as separate units. In fact, as previously indicated, the AHA acknowledgesin its brief that in the overwhelming majority of facilities where RN unitsexist, other professionals have not been represented in separate units.(AHA Br. at 24.) SEIU health care organizing director Splain concludedthat 10 years of statistics show relatively little organizing in residualhospital units. There are 16 hospitals in Ohio that have a separate RNunit, and only one unit in which professionals other than RNs are representedseparately. (King, Chi II 38-39; Shepard 4927.) Health care workers organizeno more frequently in facilities where some workers engage in collectivebargaining than they do in facilities where no bargaining units have beenrepresented (WS Splain at 14-17). One witness testified that a typicalhospital has an RN unit, an LPN unit or technical unit, a service and maintenanceunit, and sometimes an operating engineers unit (WS Patek at 4). C. Conclusion We have carefully considered the evidence in the hearings as to how a separateRN unit, or, in the alternative, an all-professional unit including RNs,might fare, based on the realities of hospital operations, organizing,and collective bargaining. We conclude based on this evidence and the argumentsadvanced that a separate RN unit is appropriate for collective bargainingpurposes.\22\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ In making our decision on this issue, we have considered<T3>St. Vincent Hospital and Health Center, </T3>285 NLRB No. 64 (Aug.19, 1987), a fairly recent case in which we held in an adjudicatory proceedingthat a separate RN unit was inappropriate. In so doing we found, <T3>inter alia, </T3>that all of the employer's professional employees``share common personnel policies and procedures and fringe benefits andhave sufficient contacts and interaction to support the finding that thesmallest appropriate bargaining unit is one consisting of all of the Employer'sprofessional employees.'' <T3>Id., </T3>slip op. at 13. Having now had the opportunity to considerthe substantial empirical evidence adduced in this rulemaking proceeding,we have a far better understanding of the RNs' training, functions, interests,and involvement in hospital operations, and of the actual and potentialramifications of each type of unit. For the reasons stated in this section,were we to apply the empirical evidence presented in these hearings, wemight well reach a different result in <T3>St. Vincent. </T3>For many years, RNs, who constitute a significant portion of the healthcare workforce, have demonstrated their commitment both  to their careersin the health care industry as well as their patients' well-being. Duringthe time period following <T3>St. Francis II, </T3>it appears that RNs consistently desired separateRN units but were compelled to organize into all-professional units inorder to avoid prolonged litigation. However, even when the RNs were forcedto include other professionals in their units, the organizing drives werequite similar to prior nurses-only campaigns.Moreover, it is apparent from testimony taken at the hearings that non-nursingprofessionals did not wish to be included in a unit with RNs. If we ignorethe perspective of the smaller, non-nursing professionals group, i.e.,the animosity expressed toward their inclusion with RNs as well as theirconcern that their ``voice'' will not be heard, then we are disregarding,at least in part, one of our major objectives. As previously indicated,the Board seeks to avoid finding too large a unit appropriate, as thismay result in ``too diversified a constituency which may generate conflictsof interest and dissatisfaction among fringe groups, making it difficultfor the union to represent * * *.'' See section III, Standard To Be Applied,<T3> supra. </T3>This latter point appears to be a concern of nursing andnon-nursing professionals alike, and is one reason we have decided to permitRNs to seek bargaining rights apart from other health care professionals.There was also testimony that would lead us to believe that some hospitalemployers' true concern with prohibition of separate RN units was not possiblefragmentation but rather defeating organization. This was demonstratedby evidence of, <T3>inter alia,</T3> employer opposition to bargaining with the RNs andother professionals in one unit when an all-professional unit was finallycertified, despite these same employers' earlier efforts to require thatall professionals be included. The distinct functions and collective bargaining interests of RNs compelthe conclusion that a separate RN unit is warranted. RNs are a unique groupin that their profession demands continuous interaction with patients.Additionally, because of licensure limitations, other professionals maynot perform RN work and vice versa. RNs have a separate labor market, andscheduling issues are more of a concern. These factors and others discussed<T3>supra </T3>support a finding that collective bargaining by RNs as aseparate unit should be permitted. The industry has contended that adverse consequences would follow havingseparate RN units, such as strikes, jurisdictional disputes, and proliferationof units. The testimony proffered at the hearings has satisfactorily alleviatedany concern we had over these possibilities. Finally, we are mindful of the growing problem involving the nursing shortage.While separate representation for the RNs does not provide the completesolution to this problem, we believe that it is an important step towardmaking the nursing profession a more attractive employment opportunityas the separate concerns of RNs are addressed more directly in a separateRN unit. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Physicians </ITAG>In our Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we provided for separate units ofphysicians in acute care hospitals having more than 100 beds. Althoughwe did not anticipate the formation of many such units, we stated we wouldpermit them because of physicians' separate education, training, and skills,and particularly because of physicians' unique position as the ultimatesupervisors of patient care. As discussed <T3>infra, </T3>we have decided not to differentiate between hospitalshaving more than 100 beds and those having fewer. However, as with RNs,see section V, <T3>supra, </T3>the evidence produced during this proceeding supportedthe proposed separate unit of physicians. Doctors have considerably more training than other professionals, i.e.,four years of medical school plus two to six years of post-graduate residencetraining, working as student residents in hospitals under the tutelageof licensed physicians (WS Cornfield). Doctors have the singular responsibility of directing all other patientcare employees; the JCAH charges doctors with overall responsibility forthe quality of professional services (Robinson, 3650-51; WS Todd at 4-5,citing 1987 Accreditation Manual). Malpractice claims are filed againstdoctors because they are responsible for medical treatment (Robinson, 3652).The AHA contends that all professionals are held responsible for malpractice(AHA Br. 30); while we do not doubt the truth of this assertion in somecircumstances, the AHA offered no details. It is common knowledge that doctors earn substantially more than otherprofessionals. They are frequently salaried, entering into individual employmentcontracts with hospitals rather than having an overall wage scale appliedto them. (Comment 94, Somers; Robinson, 3652; NYS Federation of Physicians'and Dentists' position paper Exh. D.) Supervision of doctors is limited and is generally done by other doctors(Robinson, 3651; Comment 293, Feldsine). While we recognize that otherprofessionals are also commonly supervised by their peers (Comment 71,Kowalski, St. Mary's Hospital), as indicated doctors are ultimately responsiblefor the care given patients. Doctors, of course, work with other employees, particularly on teams, orcommittees (Comment 137, McDonough Hospital; Mixon, Chi II 291; Comment248, appending statement from Spitzer of Cedars-Sinai). However, we arepersuaded by the evidence that the team approach does not change the dutiesof doctors, which are limited by law. Other employees are not permittedto do work within doctors' scope of practice. (Todd, 4348; Comment 269,Todd, AMA.) Aside from the other factors noted, doctors have particular interest inbargaining about medical education, malpractice insurance, and input intopatient care decisions (Robinson, 3655). They have little interest in theissues of special concern to RNs, such as floating, per diem, uniform allowances,overtime, etc. (NYS Federation of Physicians' and Dentists' position paper,Exhs. B, D, E, and F), and are outnumbered by nurses at a ratio of at least15:1 (Todd, 4324, 4328), and perhaps 20:1 (AHA Br. 28). We are concernedthat if doctors were forced to be included in the same unit with nursesand other professionals, doctors' interests would be overwhelmed (Todd,4324). Florida, after 10 years, removed doctors from an all-professionalunit in state facilities because of money considerations (Lumpkin, 100,111-12). In one wall-to-wall unit including doctors, the hospital wantedraises just for doctors because of recruitment problems; the union opposedthis because it would give raises just to one group in the unit (Robinson,3654-55). A number of employers similarly expressed concerns about puttingphysicians in units of other professionals (Comment 94, Somers, attorneyto many health care facilities; Comment 304, Kaiser Permanente; Comment1, Lancaster Fairfield Community Hosp.; Comment 17, Middletown RegionalHosp.; Comment 48, St. Vincent's Medical Center, Bridgeport; Comment 141,Ayres). A wall-to-wall unit at O'Bleness Hospital did not include doctors(AHA Exh. 8D). While the number of doctors employed in hospitals is small, and the percentageof employed doctors compared to other employees remains about the same,the actual number of employed doctors is increasing (Todd, 4335), and thereis some evidence that doctors are organizing at increasing rates (AFL Exh.4). We are persuaded that the evidence weighs in favor of a separate unit forphysicians, where sought. Thus, to include them with RNs and other professionalsseems likely to lead to divisiveness and quite possibly to conflicts ofinterest. We have found no evidence that to grant doctors a separate unitwould lead to repetitious bargaining, frequent strikes, or jurisdictionaldisputes. We believe the proper balance is struck in favor of a separateunit for all physicians, where requested.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Other Professionals </ITAG>In our original Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we tentatively providedfor a separate unit of all professional employees, excluding registerednurses and physicians, in acute care facilities having over 100 beds. Wenoted that section 9(b)(1) of the Act mandated separate representationfor professional employees unless a majority of those employees vote forinclusion in a unit with non-professionals. In view of the provision forseparate RNs' and physicians' units, it was and continues to be necessaryto provide for a separate unit of professionals excluding these two classificationsalthough, as noted <T3>supra, </T3>we have decided to abandon the proposed 100-bed differentiation.A number of so-called ``other professionals'' appeared in person at thehearings to testify. In general, they confirmed the lack of interest whichRNs exhibited towards their circumstances, and the fact that, despite theirdifferent professions, they were able to achieve collective bargainingin all-professional units, excluding RNs and physicians. (Indelicato, socialworker, 3673, 3678; Ahmed, laboratory technologist, 3705-06; Crisafulli,pharmacist, 3711, 3737.) In a comment, physical therapists expressed apreference for their own separate unit, but if placed with other professionalsthey would prefer that unit did not include RNs (Comment 134). Some fearwas expressed that, because of their numbers, RNs (and also technicals)would overwhelm the other professionals if included in the same unit withthem (Ratner, 3731-32; WS Cornfield, Table 1). A number of ``other professional'' classifications work relatively independently,and have no immediate direct supervision (Ratner, 3735). They generallywork the day shift, on weekdays (Indelicato, 3681), though some work onother shifts (see, e.g., Comment 275, Presbyterian Hospital). As a groupthey have high prestige within the hospital because of their superior educationand training (WS Cornfield, Table 6). Despite the desire expressed by some other professionals for their ownseparate units, and despite some history of separate representation ofeach profession, mainly in New York (see, e.g., Friedman, 5038), it seemsclear to us that to provide for such additional units might create theproliferation which Congress meant to avoid. Moreover, despite the existenceof some units combining technicals with other professionals (see, e.g.,Willman, 4480, 4483, 4485, 4486; Shea, 5208; Robfogel, Chi. II, 224), Sec.9(b)(1) of the Act prohibits such a combined unit, unless the professionalsseparately vote for inclusion with the non professionals. Accordingly,based on the above, we affirm the appropriateness of a separate unit ofall professional employees, other than RNs and physicians. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Technicals </ITAG>A. Introduction In our Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we tentatively determined that technicalemployees constituted a separate appropriate bargaining unit. Among thereasons we expressed were:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) That, in comparison with other non-professionals, they typicallyhave significantly higher levels of skill and training, and are paid substantiallymore; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) That it has been the Board's consistent practice to approve separateunits of technical employees; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) That these separate units generally have met with approval fromthe courts of appeals.</ITAG>After carefully considering the evidence presented during the rulemakingproceedings, we have determined that technical employees appropriatelyconstitute a separate bargaining unit. B. Technical Employees Are Separate and Distinct From Other Non-ProfessionalEmployees 1. <T3>Education, licensing, training, and skills. </T3>Technical employeesare found in major occupational groups including: medical laboratory, respiratorytherapy, radiography, emergency medicine, and medical records.\23\<NOTE/> (WS McKinney, 2.) The evidence presented at the hearingsdemonstrates that technical employees perform jobs involving the use ofindependent judgment and specialized training, as opposed to service andmaintenance employees who generally perform unskilled tasks and need onlya high school education (AFL Br. 32, citing <T3>Southern Maryland Hospital Center, </T3>274 NLRB 1470 (1985); McKinney,5502-03, 5523-24; Colbert, 5020; WS Shea at 20). Testimony indicated thatthe gap between technical employees and service and maintenance workersactually is widening, with higher levels of technical skills more closelyaligned to professional job categories rather than to other non-professionalcategories (WS Shea at 20; WS Schoen at 14 and 5175-76). Thus, technicalemployees occupy a high-prestige status distinct from other categoriesof non-professional employees because of the training requirements fortheir jobs (WS Cornfield at 12-13). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ Although we note that historically, those employees whoenter and decode patient data in medical records have been placed in serviceand maintenance units or overall non-professional units (see e.g., <T3>Levine Hospital of Hayward, </T3>219 NLRB 327 (1975); Duke University,226 NLRB 470 (1976)), the inclusion of ``medical records technicians''in a separate technical unit may be litigated as a unit placement issuewhen it arises, on a case-by-case basis. Technical employees further are distinguished by the support role theyplay within the hospital, and by the fact that they work in patient care.Examples of their work include: routine clinical tests performed by medicallaboratory technicians; general respiratory care administered by respiratorytherapists; and x-rays, ultrasound procedures, and CAT scans performedby various technicians. (WS Briguglio at 3.) Contrary to the AHA's statement that ``no evidence of separate or distinctemployment attributes of technical employees was presented at the hearings''(AHA Br. 33), the evidence shows that all health care technical employeeshave significant additional education and/or training beyond high school,including: community college associate degree programs which provide mathand science background beyond that which high schools offer (WS McKinneyat 5); vocational training programs run by hospitals (WS McKinney at 7);programs at accredited schools of technology (WS Briguglio at 2); and,in some fields, a full 4-year college degree (Schoen, 5176; McKinney, 5477).Further, the evidence indicates that most hospital technical employeesare either certified (usually by passing a national examination), licensed,or required to register with the appropriate state authority (Willman,4474), although laws regarding such licensure, registration, training andqualifications vary throughout the country (Ahmed, 3709-11). There was evidence that some deskilling is occurring in the technical categories,reducing the need for higher skills in operating some equipment; however,the evidence further shows that it is not across-the-board (McKinney, 5485).Further, hospitals must purchase expensive and complicated equipment todeskill a task (McKinney, 5486); and where, for example, a technologist'swork may be deskilled, it then would be performed by a technician ratherthan by a service worker (McKinney, 5513-14; Berliner, 5633-34).2. <T3>Wages, hours, and working conditions. </T3>Although, in general, hospitalsapply similar benefit and labor relations policies to technical and othernon-professional employees, the evidence shows that the wages and hoursof technical employees differ significantly from those of the other non-professionals(Mass. Hospital Assn., Comment 105). Technicians were shown to occupy themiddle ranks in the hierarchy of health care workers, and the evidencepresented regarding hospital pay scales reflects this standing (WS Schoenat 15). On the average, technicians earn $2,000 per year more than serviceworkers in this industry (WS Schoen at 15, Table 1; Henry, 3084-85). Whilethe wages of service workers are tied to the unskilled labor market, andthose of business office clericals and skilled maintenance workers aresimilar to those of comparable jobs outside the industry, technicians'wages are tied to the earnings of the more highly skilled technologistswith whom they work, and they generally earn approximately 75% of whatthe technologists earn (WS McKinney at 12-13, andamp; 5479). Thus, managementneeds to provide higher entry wages for technicians than for service workers(Shea, 5238-39; Briguglio, 5300-01; Henry, 3084-88). Technical employees work daytime hours, with evening, night, and weekendskeleton crews, while business office clericals work daytime hours andservice and maintenance employees are staffed on a 24-hour basis (Colbert,5016-17). 3. <T3>Supervision. </T3>The evidence indicates that technical employees usuallyhave separate supervision from other non-professional employees; however,this may differ from facility to facility. For example, a supervisor ofsome technical employees may also supervise business office clericals;or a laboratory manager who supervises technical employees also may supervisesome service and maintenance employees. (Mass. Hosp. Assn., Comment 105;Briguglio, 5300.) 4. <T3>Contact with other employees. </T3>Technical employees typically performtheir work in laboratories or in technical departments, and not in patientcare areas (AFL Br. 41; Booth, 3693), although the AHA's brief states thatmore hospitals are beginning to locate some laboratory facilities in patientcare areas and technicals may have direct and continuing involvement withother categories of employees as well as with patients (AHA Br. 33). Thetasks that technicals perform, such as processing and reviewing patientspecimens, taking x-rays, EKGs and EEGs, are considered ancillary services,diagnostic in nature (AFL Br. 41). Technicals have no contact with businessoffice clericals, and only minimal contact with service employees, butin a typical laboratory, work with doctors, technologists, clericals, andmessengers (WS Briguglio, 4-5; Colbert, 5017-18; AHA Br. 33). The evidenceshows that LPNs do work in patient care areas and provide direct patientcare; however, the Board has found them to be appropriately included withtechnicals in light of their skill level and the requirement that theybe licensed (AFL Br. 41 citing NLRB Exh. 5, revised). 5. <T3>Cross training. </T3>There is no temporary interchange, and littlepermanent interchange between technical employees and other non-professionalsbecause of the difference in skills, the specialized functions of the technicals,and the differences in their education (Shea, 5221-22). Service workerstypically have only a high school education or less and cannot be placedin technical positions in the absence of elaborate training programs (McKinney,5481). Contrary to statements of industry witnesses who maintain that aservice worker could take a six-week training program and be able to readEKG equipment (King, 5488), we are persuaded that technical training requiresfull or nearly fulltime education, and a high school education does notprovide the mathematics and science background necessary (WS Shea at 21).The evidence shows that cross-training programs are being offered at somehospitals and colleges; however, training prograns and funds to provideclassroom instruction for hospital employees are rare in hospitals thatare not unionized (Schoen Supplemental Statement). Thus, the majority ofcross-training that occurs is among the technical categories themselves(LPNs doing EKG work formerly done by EKG technicians; medical technologistsadministering blood gases previously administered by respiratory technicians)(St. Anthony's Health Corp., Comment 142; St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, Iowa,Comment 243). Moreover, new technology has brought about a decline in technicianjobs requiring only minimal training, while increasing the need for moreintensely-trained technicians, thus widening the gap between technicalemployees, who are becoming more skilled and sophisticated, and serviceand maintenance workers (WS Schoen, 14-15; WS Shea at 21). 6. <T3>Career paths and the labor market. </T3>Technical employees have aseparate career path and labor market. They do not seek to transfer intoother types of non-professional jobs; rather, technicians may seek to becometechnologists in the same line of technical work; or LPNs may seek to becomeRNs. (O'Cleireacain, 5426; Ryan, 4738-39.) While some LPNs may become RNsthrough training programs, progression to technologist is more difficultfor technicians because of the 4-year college requirement for many technologicalpositions (WS Schoen at 15; McKinney, 5477). Their existing training isnot considered a ``building block'' toward technologist status, withoutsuccessful negotiations with licensing and accreditation boards (Schoen,Supplemental Statement). Thus, in addition to little mobility in theirimmediate workplace, it is also difficult for technicians to move out ofthat workplace. As long as they wish to practice their specialities, theymust remain in the health care industry. (WS McKinney at 12.) Statisticsshow that 100% of job placements from technical programs are in healthcare occupations (Ryan, 4744). In contrast, business office clericals andskilled maintenance workers have great mobility outside the industry, asdo unskilled service employees (O'Cleireacain, 5427; Marshall, 4018-19).Evidence presented at the hearings shows that the labor market for technicians,which until recently was expanding steadily, is contracting (McKinney,5474, 5478). Witnesses testified that with the introduction of cost containmenttechniques into the industry, the future of technical workers is in a stateof flux. Further, even though new technology and equipment continue tobe developed, at the same time hospitals are seeking to save on labor costsby replacing expensive, skilled employees, closing laboratories, and contractingout laboratory services. (WS McKinney at 13; Berliner, 5598.) Certificateof Need programs impose limits on the addition of new technology, furtherreducing the need for new technicians. For all of these reasons, trainingprograms have become an important bargaining issue. (Schoen, SupplementalStatement.) C. Organizing and Bargaining The health care industry's bargaining unit proposals in 1973-74 would haveallowed a separate unit for technical employees in hospitals (AFL Br. 31);and since 1974, the Board has continued to find separate technical unitsappropriate (NLRB Exh. 5, revised; <T3>Southern Maryland Hospital Center, </T3>274 NLRB 1470 (1985)). As wenoted in our proposed rule, court decisions have approved the Board's determinationsas to technical units. See, e.g., <T3>Watonwan Memorial Hospital v. NLRB, </T3>711 F.2d 848 (8th Cir. 1983);<T3>NLRB v. Sweetwater Hospital Association, </T3>604 F.2d 454 (6th Cir.1979). See also <T3>Vicksburg Hospital v. NLRB, </T3>653 F.2d 1070, 1075 (5th Cir. 1981).Further, the evidence shows that technicals choose to organize in technicalgroups and not with other non-professionals (Booth, 3686-88). In the 588hospitals in which a union affiliated with the AFL represents at leastone bargaining unit, there are 311 separate technical units (includingLPN units), and only 52 units in which technical employees and other non-professionalsare combined into a single bargaining unit (AFL Br. 44 and Appendix A;Booth, 3688-90). In addition, LPNs organize with technicals who have thesame training, education, licensure, and certification requirements (Muehlenkamp,4787).Organizing drives are initiated by employees with specific concerns andgrievances (WS Splain at 4; Sackman, 3592; Schmidt, 3628; Muehlenkamp,4784). Other interests include professional conferences, training, androtations (Colbert, 5019). At the hearings, no union organizer who wasasked could recall any situation in which technical employees sought toinclude business office clericals or unskilled service workers, or viceversa (Olson, 4718; Muehlenkamp, 4784). Technical employees generally choose to have separate initial contracts;however, they may agree, after the initial agreement expires, to engagein joint bargaining, but retain separate delegates for negotiations andfor presenting separate issues (Booth, 3688; Colbert, 5021-22). Althoughindustry witnesses maintain that the fact that technical employees organizeand bargain their first contract as a separate unit does not justify findinga separate technical unit appropriate where subsequent bargaining historyshows that they now bargain in broader units (St. Luke's/Roosevelt, Comment224; AHA Br. 32-33), there is evidence that difficulties have arisen occasionallywhere technicals have been included with maintenance employees and clericalsbecause of their different training, duties, and wages (Logan, Comment150, pp. 3-4). D. Proliferation Technical units generally encompass a wide range of classifications, includingLPNs, and they constitute approximately 17% of the health care work force_asubstantial complement of workers (WS McKinney at 2; WS Schoen at 3, 5).What evidence there is shows that strikes involving technical employeesalone are rare. In New York City, for example, strikes involving technicalemployees occur in broader units of clericals, service and maintenance,and professional employees. (Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Medical Center, Comment270.) E. Other Issues The label ``technical'' may no longer define a particular group of jobs,and indeed, the union witnesses who appeared at the rulemaking hearingsoften did not distinguish between technicians and technologists (Schoen,5175; Ahmed, 3709-11; McKinney, 5471-79; WS Briguglio at 2-3.) Technologistsoften have been included as professional employees in professional-onlyunits. See, e.g., <T3>Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, </T3>222 NLRB 588 (1976); <T3>Mercy Hospitals of Sacramento, </T3>217 NLRB 765, 769 (1975). Althoughindustry witnesses urge the Board to consider the practical effect of thedifficulties of resolving issues of unit placement, and caution that theremay be ``intense litigation'' over unit placement which could be avoidedby the inclusion of technicals in a broad non-professional unit (AHA Br.34), we note that, even with such inclusion, litigation could continueto occur over which technicians were professional employees. Individualplacement issues always have been present in the consideration of healthcare and other cases. In our opinion, their existence should not deterthe Board from taking the first step, i.e., determining the threshold appropriatenessof a separate technical unit. F. Conclusion For the above reasons, we determine that separate technical units are appropriatefor collective bargaining. The evidence clearly demonstrates that the variedtechnical employees employed in the health care industry are appropriatelygrouped into a single unit by virtue of their education, training, andspecialized skills, and do not constitute a unit so large as to be overlydiversified and hence unwieldy for organizing and collective bargaining.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Skilled Maintenance </ITAG>A. Introduction In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Board tentatively determinedthat service and maintenance employees constituted a separate appropriateunit and that skilled maintenance employees should be included in thatunit rather than represented in separate skilled maintenance units. Amongthe reasons we expressed for including skilled maintenance employees inthe broader service and maintenance units were:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) That their skill levels do not, at times, greatly exceed thoseof other service and maintenance unit employees; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) That they work throughout hospital's facilities, and thus frequentlycome into contact with other service and maintenance employees; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Their inclusion in broader units will help to prevent unit proliferation;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) As a practical matter, the Board's approval of separate maintenanceunits had fared poorly in the courts.</ITAG>After carefully considering the evidence amassed during the rulemakinghearings, we have determined that, contrary to our earlier impressions,skilled maintenance employees can and should constitute a separate appropriatebargaining unit. B. Relationship to Other Employees 1. <T3>Functions and skill level. </T3>Evidence from the rulemaking hearingsshows that skilled maintenance employees perform functions apart from thoseof unskilled service, maintenance, and clerical employees in that theseemployees deal with highly complex and sophisticated systems and equipment(Carrick, 3448-3450; Jacquin, 5354-55; Lake, 146-148). While they occasionallyperform routine, unskilled tasks, skilled maintenance employees are generallyengaged in the operation, maintenance, and repair of the hospital's physicalplant systems, such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration,electrical, plumbing and mechanical (Lake, 150-151; Viat, 3457-59, 3476-77;Hach, 5318; Giblin, 5382-83). Work on these systems requires abstract skillsand knowledge at levels considerably higher than those of other non-professionalhospital employees (Marshall, 4010-4012; Hammond Exh. 1, pp. 340-45, 580-623;Cornfield, 5698; WS Cornfield at 4-6, citing Dictionary of OccupationalTitles of U.S. Employment and Training Administration). Skilled maintenanceemployees are rated more highly, for example, even than physicians on themanipulation of ``things'' (WS Cornfield at 5). Skilled maintenance employeesare frequently required to have postsecondary training in their field,such as vocational or trade school. Even the lower skilled maintenanceemployees in plant operations and maintenance are required to have higherskills than those required of service employees. (Jacquin, 5363-64, 5374,5377; Viat, 3459-60; Giblin, 5384.) 2. <T3>Education, licensing, and training. </T3>Contrary to virtually allnonsupervisory service classifications, which require only a grade schooleducation, skilled maintenance classifications require completion of highschool; at least some trade or vocational school experience, if not graduationtherefrom; completion of formal or informal apprenticeship programs, whichmay take several years; or an associate's or bachelor's degree (Hammond,5404-05, 5409-12; AHA Health Care Occupations: A Comprehensive Job DescriptionManual pp. 340-45, 385-88, 394-402, 499-501, 561-62, 567-70, 573-74, 580-623;Marshall, 4010). Skilled maintenance employees also need continuing educationto keep abreast of technological changes in building maintenance, suchas computers and remote controls (Carrick, 3454; Marshall, 4011-12; Schloop,Chi II 165; Schwemm, Chi II 186-89; Hammond, 5408; WS Schwemm, Exh. 5-9;WS Fowler at 4; WS Denevi at 7-9). Moreover, the amount of training availablein skilled maintenance classifications compares favorably to that offeredin various technical classifications, such as lab technician and medicalrecords technician (WS McKinney at 6-7), and access to the programs andthe upward mobility they bring provide a common concern to employees largelyunshared by those outside the skilled maintenance group (Schloop, Chi II165; Ryan, 4739). Another distinction between skilled maintenance and unskilledservice employees is that at least seven skilled maintenance classifications,but no service classifications, require licenses. (Hammond, 5404-06; WSCornfeld, at  6-8)3. <T3>Supervision. </T3>The distinct nature of skilled maintenance functionsis underscored by the frequent placement of skilled maintenance employeesin separate departments, usually coinciding with the hospitals' plant engineeringor maintenance departments (Carrick, 3448; Viat, 3457, 3478; Marshall,4014; Hach, 5342, 5354). Thus, skilled maintenance employees frequentlyhave their own supervision (Hammond, Exh. 1, pp. 581-590). Moreover, skilledmaintenance employees are not supervised by any supervisors from outsidetheir own departments (see, e.g., WS Fowler at 8). 4. <T3>Wages, hours, working conditions. </T3>While it appears that certainterms and conditions of employment, i.e., fringe benefits and personnelpolicies, are similar among non-professional employees (Jacquin, 5368-70;Comer, Chi II 326-29; Comment 129, Hall), wage rates paid to skilled maintenanceemployees underscore their higher skills and training. Thus, the most recentIndustry Wage Survey: Hospitals, Aug. 1985, BLS of the DOL, shows thatskilled maintenance employees in private hospitals in 23 metropolitan areasaveraged $11.89/hour whereas, in comparison, employees in six service classificationsaveraged $6.84/hour, office clericals in five classifications averaged$7.56/hour, and employees in ten technical classifications averaged $9.89/hour.(Lake, 154-55; IUOE, Exh. 4.) Thus, on the average, skilled maintenanceemployees earn 25% more than technicians, almost 60% more than businessoffice clericals, and 76% more than service employees. Moreover, the wagerate of lesser skilled maintenance employees, while lower than that ofthe most skilled maintenance employees, almost always exceeds that of eventhe highest-paid service employees and often exceeds the rate of employeesin other classifications as well. 5. <T3>Interaction with other employees. </T3>Though they primarily work inmaintenance areas, skilled maintenance employees do perform work throughoutthe hospitals (Kelly, Chi II 178; Carrick, 3453; Hach, 5330). As a result,skilled maintenance employees have contact with just about every otheremployee in a hospital. However, these contacts are brief, limited, andincidental as it appears that the only employees with whom skilled maintenanceemployees actually work are others from the maintenance department (Carrick,3453-54; Jacquin, 5360; Kelly, Chi II 212-13), and that the contacts withnon-maintenance employees typically consist of other employees' identifyingthe maintenance problem to the skilled maintenance employees (Kelly, ChiII 178, 213; Jacquin, 5360; WS Fowler at 8). 6. <T3>Labor market and career paths. </T3>Skilled maintenance employees haveseparate labor markets and highly mobile cross-industrial career pathsas the operation and maintenance of physical plant systems are the sameno matter in which industry they are performed (Marshall, 4014; Schloop,Chi II 163; Kelly, Chi II 177; Fox, 3436-37; O'Cleireacain, 5427; WS Deneviat 4). Easy mobility in skilled maintenance classifications tends to orientthese employees toward their skills rather than the industry in which theyare employed (Lake, 144, 490; Marshall, 4010, 4019). The external skilledmaintenance labor market also affects the hiring and wage scales in thehealth care industry since hospitals compete with other industries, suchas hotels and office buildings, for these employees (Berliner, 5645; Hach,5344-45; WS Schoen at 23; Corbett, 3344-45). Skilled maintenance employees are in a separate internal labor market withinthe hospital in terms of career path, training, and promotion. There areformal and on-the-job training programs to permit lower level maintenanceemployees who have acquired skills and knowledge to move into more highlyskilled positions; yet, there is virtually no transfer of clerical or serviceemployees into maintenance classifications. (Schloop, Chi II 204-05; Kelly,Chi II 216-17; Giblin, 5400; O'Cleireacain, 5427, 5468; WS Shea at 18.)Even entry level jobs are filled by those with skilled maintenance backgrounds(Hach, 5327; Schloop, Chi II 203-04). C. History of Representation The appropriateness of separate skilled maintenance units is supportedby a history of separate representation, especially by labor organizationsspecializing in the separate representation of skilled maintenance employees(IUOE Exh. 2 revised; Holland, Chi II 305-09; Friedman, 5036, 5040-41;Peters, Chi II 131-34; Comer, Chi II 320, 327-28; Hach, 5328; Giblin, 5395).For example, the IUOE currently represents at least 237 separate skilledmaintenance units in both private and public health care institutions nationwide(IUOE Br. 56). Twenty percent of IUOE health care units date from the 1940'sand '50's, and 85% of them predate the 1974 amendments (IUOE Exh. 2 revised).Admittedly, there are skilled maintenance employees represented in combinedservice and maintenance units, or in a handful of broader non-professionalunits, but inclusion of skilled maintenance employees with these otheremployees does not necessarily show a voluntary grouping as some combinedunits are the result of stipulations so that elections could be held withoutfurther delay, or are atypical situations (Stickler, Chi I 16-26; Twomey,131-34; Emanuel, 3497; Ratner, 3728; AHA Exh. 4-9; Willman, 4491-92; Muehlenkamp,4767; Friedman, 5041; King, 4244, 4249, 4251-52). In addition, the evidenceregarding combined units is equivocal in that the ``maintenance'' employeesin ``service and maintenance'' units are frequently unskilled rather thanskilled maintenance employees (Silberman, 5651; IUOE Br. 58; Shea, 5227-28;Splain, 5302-04). D. Organizing and Bargaining Interests 1. <T3>Organizing. </T3>Though clearly not impossible, it appears that becauseof the variety of personal interests involved it is more difficult to organizelarger, combined units than to organize separate smaller units of employees(Viat, 3465; Sackman, 3578; Schwarz, 265; WS Schwarz, Koziara study pp.1, 4, Figure 1; Delaney, 4517-18, 4525; Silberman, 5686; AFL Exh. 2). Largerheterogeneous units deter decertifications of unions as well (Delaney,4523). In addition, skilled maintenance employees usually do not wish toorganize with other groups, and it is unusual for different groups of non-professionalemployees to seek to organize in the same unit (Muehlenkamp, 4785; Olson,4698-99; Ratner, 3730). There is evidence that, where combined units aresought, separate interests of the diverse groups may make it difficult,or impossible, to hold organizing meetings of the entire group (Viat, 3465).2. <T3>Bargaining interests. </T3>While all employees have some similar bargainingconcerns, i.e., wages, hours, and fringe benefits, skilled maintenanceemployees have additional interests different from those of other non-professionalemployees. They seek wage levels commensurate with those of skilled maintenanceemployees in other industries; access to craft-related education and trainingprograms; tool supply allowances; safety equipment and practices; portablepensions, because of their cross-industrial mobility; and input with respectto subcontracting of work. (Kelly, Chi II 175; Marshall, 4011; Willman,4492-93; Schloop, Chi II 164-65; Schwemm, Chi II 209; Viat, 3466-67; Giblin,5388.) Service employees and business office clericals have specializedbargaining interests as well (Schloop, Chi II 168; Viat, 3466-67; Gregory,5746). These differences lead to difficulties in bargaining in a heterogeneousgroup, and may result in the smaller group of skilled maintenance employeesgetting lost in the shuffle in negotiations relating to the more numerouslesser skilled employees (Schloop, Chi II 168-69; Olson, 4729-30; Viat,3465; Willman, 4492; Ratner, 3734; Shea, 5187; Muehlenkamp, 4795-96). Negotiatingin a broader unit may also serve to broaden the scope of labor disputesby involving employees whose personal interests are not of concern in disputesrelating to the interests of other unit employees (Viat, 3466). For example,in one hospital in which two unions jointly represented a combined unitof service, skilled maintenance, technical, and plant clerical employees,the skilled maintenance employees were forced to join other employees ina strike over unresolved bargaining issues that affected only the otheremployees even though all issues involving the skilled maintenance employeeshad already been settled (Viat, 3466).E. Proliferation Contrary to our concern, as expressed in our NPR, there was no evidenceadduced at the rulemaking hearings that establishing a separate unit ofskilled maintenance employees will lead to proliferation of bargainingunits in the industry (Kelly, Chi II 180; Gilmore, 4894; Splain, 5252).No labor organizations have sought or demonstrated the appropriatenessof other small units (IUOE Br. 64-65). Moreover, the skilled maintenanceemployee unit may be viewed as a consolidation of specialized employeesinasmuch as it combines such employees as carpenters, painters, plumbers,and electricians (IUOE Br. 65). The only employee classification performingwork similar to that performed by traditional craft or trade-type maintenanceemployees are biomedical technicians (Marshall, 4018-20; Hach, 5346-49;Jacquin, 5377; Viat, 3480-81; Giblin, 5396-98). Biomedical technicianswork on and repair sophisticated computer-based equipment, and becauseof both their skills and training share a community of interest with otherskilled maintenance employees and in many instances have already been includedin some such units (Fox, Exh. 1 and 2; Hammond, Exh. 12; Viat, 3458, 3460,3480; Giblin, 5495-97; Marshall, 4019-20; McKinney, 5497, 5525; Hach, 5347-49;Jacquin, 5377; Schloop, Chi II 203-04; Carrick, 3448). F. Strikes, Sympathy Strikes, Jurisdictional Disputes, and Wage Leapfroggingor Whipsawing 1. <T3>Primary strikes. </T3>The evidence taken at the rulemaking hearingsshows that the presence of separate skilled maintenance units has not resultedin a large number of strikes by these units (Lake, 157; IUOE Exh. 2; Viat3468; Schloop, Chi II 169; Kelly, Chi II 180; Hach, 5323; Giblin, 5389;Hammond Exh. 12, attached affidavits). The hospitals contend that the numberof strikes is low because the number of employees involved is small andtherefore the cost of a strike exceeds the potential increase in laborcosts of the union's demands thereby making it more likely that hospitalswill give in to those demands. Nonetheless, the fact remains that in the237 skilled maintenance units represented by the IUOE, in which hundredsof contracts have been negotiated, there have been only about 25 strikesever (Lake, 157; IUOE Exh. 2). In addition, the incidence of strikes byskilled maintenance employees has not increased in proportion to the numberof other represented units of hospital employees (IUOE Exh. 2; Viat, 3468-69;Fox, 3442). The few strikes that have occurred have been almost exclusivelyin support of bargaining demands, and have not been disruptive to healthcare delivery; indeed, skilled maintenance employees have offered to provideskeleton crews to assure uninterrupted service in the event of a work stoppage(Henry, 3059; Fox, 3442; Viat, 3467-68, 3470; Hammond Exh. 12, affidavitsof Bess, Tighe, and Scheb.) Moreover, other hospital employees, whetherrepresented or not, generally have not engaged in work stoppages in supportof striking skilled maintenance employees (Hammond Exh. 12, affidavitsof Bess, Tighe, and Scheb). 2. <T3>Sympathy strikes. </T3>While the strike rate in the health care industryin general is low (Subrin, Chi I 119-20; Schoen, 5181; Silberman, 5659),there is evidence that hospitals have not availed themselves of the opportunityto limit the possibility of successive multiple strikes by supporting unionproposals for common contract expiration dates of different units' contracts;indeed, hospitals have opposed such proposals. (Henry, 3075; Absalom, 3318-19;Corbett, 3359-60; Schmidt, 3625; Weinrich, 4274; Muehlenkamp, 4771, 4774).Moreover, there have been virtually no sympathy strikes by skilled maintenanceemployees in support of other striking hospital employees (Schloop, ChiII 169; Kelly, Chi II 180; Fox, 3442; Friedman, 5060; Hach, 5323; Jacquin,5361; Giblin, 5389; WS Fowler at 7; Hammond Exh. 12, affidavits of Bess,Tighe, and Chambers). No-strike clauses, which are generally honored, appearto have contributed to the infrequency of such strikes (Fox, 3442; Friedman,5060-61). And, while the evidence shows that bargaining in broad, heterogeneousgroups may serve to expand the scope of a strike by involving employeeswhose personal interests are not of concern in disputes relating to theinterests of other unit employees (Viat, 3466; see above discussion insubsection (d)(2), Bargaining Interests), it also shows that the absenceof sympathy strikes in the industry makes it unlikely that such expansionsof strikes will occur where employees with separate and distinct interestsare represented in separate units. 3. <T3>Jurisdictional disputes. </T3>In general, industry witnesses were unableto support the allegation that allowing separate skilled maintenance unitswould increase the number of jurisdictional disputes in the industry (Graumann,409; Weinrich, 4254, 4281; Cammarata, 4406). Instead, the evidence showsthat jurisdictional disputes over work assignments involving skilled maintenanceemployees are, like those in the hospital industry in general, rare andnondisruptive (Roth, 3153; Muehlenkamp, 4775; WS Shea at 14). Moreover,we are persuaded that the types of jurisdictional disputes which do arise,i.e., disputes over job classification, content, and responsibility, occurregardless of whether the employees are represented in one unit or severaldifferent units (Krasovec, 420-22; Hach, 5324; Giblin, 5389-90; WS Sheaat 14). Finally, the few disputes which have arisen have been resolvedinformally, minimizing disruption of normal operations (Schloop, Chi II170-71; Kelly, Chi II 181, 206, 207; Fox, 3442-43 andamp; Exh. 2; Viat, 3471;Hach, 5323; Jacquin, 5361; Giblin, 5389).4. <T3>Wage whipsawing and leapfrogging. </T3>Wage whipsawing or leapfroggingvirtually never occurs with skilled maintenance units inasmuch as the wagesof skilled maintenance employees are generally based on the wages of skilledmaintenance employees in other industries, rather than on the wages ofother health care industry employees (Corbett, 3344; Hach, 5344-45). G. Changes in the Industry The alleged trend toward specialized hospitals and integration of employeefunctions would appear to have no impact on skilled maintenance units becausethe physical plant systems will essentially remain the same and will requireskilled maintenance employees to operate and maintain them (Viat, 3470).Any move toward interdisciplinary teams also appears to have had no effecton skilled maintenance employees as virtually every team that was describedby the industry included only health care personnel (Mixon, Chi II 275;Gallagher, 3541-42; Houston, 4025, 4050-55; Donnelly, 4064, 4080; Sokatch,4195; Weinrich, 4268-69; Comment 62, Achterhof; Comment 78, Olman GreaterCincinnati Hospital Council). The one example provided at the hearingsof skilled maintenance employees' participating on a team involved theskilled maintenance employees' voluntarily critiquing vocational trainingprojects of rehabilitation patients (Coney, 165). This one example of anincidental function undertaken by a maintenance group at one hospital is,so far as we know, unique, but in any event does not involve direct patientcare and is clearly insufficient to obliterate their distinct functions.Finally, the industry gave no examples of skilled maintenance employeesbeing cross-trained into other job groups such as clericals or serviceemployees and, cross-training from service to skilled maintenance positionsor technical positions is virtually unknown. (Stickler, Chi I 9, 33-37;Houston, 4026; O'Cleireacain, 5467-68; McKinney, 5481.) H. Other Issues 1. <T3>Costs of multiple units with reference to skilled maintenance. </T3>Assumingthe relevance of the potential cost to the industry of negotiating in additionalunits, the evidence does not support the conclusion that units of skilledmaintenance employees would necessarily have any adverse effect on hospitals'expenses. The evidence there is shows that contract negotiations for skilledmaintenance units tend to be relatively short, which means relatively inexpensive(Comer, Chi II 328; Viat, 3469; Jacquin, 5378). 2. <T3>Congressional admonition against proliferation. </T3>The admonitionagainst proliferation of units was directed toward problems that couldbe caused by having many separate bargaining units, i.e., substantial numbersof strikes interfering with the delivery of health care services, wagewhipsawing, and jurisdictional disputes. As shown above, there is littleor no evidence that the existence of separate skilled maintenance unitshas resulted, or would in the future result, in these problems. As a practicalmatter, permitting separate skilled maintenance units would not necessarilyresult in the creation of still additional bargaining units since mosthospitals have substantially fewer organized units than the number proposedby either the Board or the unions. (Schwarz, 264, WS Table 1; Robfogel,Chi II 223; Comer, Chi II 329; Cammarata, 4425; Delaney, 4520; Muehlenkamp,4770-71; Shea, 5163.) During the 1973 legislative hearings on S. 794, the fear expressed by anumber of witnesses was that Board precedent might permit a separate unitfor each trade or craft found in hospitals. Thus, e.g., Sidney Lewine,testifying on behalf of AHA, and Richard V. Whelan, Jr., representing theOhio Hospital Association, noted with apprehension the proliferation thatwould result if the Board were to grant a separate unit to each constructioncraft such as stationary engineers, carpenters, plumbers, electricians,pipefitters, and painters. (Coverage of Nonprofit Hospitals Under NationalLabor Relations Act, 1973, Hearings on S. 794 and S. 2292, at 128-29, and465-66, respectively.) The Board's proposal directly takes into accountthis concern, which was called to Congress' attention, by putting all suchseparate skilled crafts into <T3>one </T3>skilled maintenance unit. 3. <T3>The most recent Board decision. </T3>In <T3>St. Francis Hospital, </T3>286 NLRB No. 123 (Nov. 30, 1987) (<T3>St. Francis III</T3>), the Board held that a separate maintenance unitwas inappropriate. In so doing, the Board found that the hospital's maintenanceemployees constituted less than 10% of the hospital's 438 service and maintenanceemployees, and spent approximately 80-95% of their time working throughoutthe hospital, thus bringing them in frequent contact with all other hospitalemployees. The Board further found that the hospital used independent contractorsto perform difficult work, and that the sought employees shared the samebasic terms and conditions of employment as service employees, includingdepartmental supervision. The Board also noted that its finding that theseparticular maintenance employees did not constitute a separate appropriateunit was based on the particular facts of the case and was in no way anexpression of its view concerning the appropriateness of maintenance unitsin general. Based on the evidence obtained during the rulemaking hearings,it is unlikely that we would reach the same result. Thus, the evidencefrom the hearings shows that, in virtually all health care facilities whichwere the subject of testimony at the hearings, skilled maintenance employeesconstitute a discrete and distinct group of employees. They perform functionsapart from those of unskilled service, maintenance, and clerical employees.Skilled maintenance employees were shown to be highly skilled as evidencedby higher educational, licensing, and training requirements. While theyshare some common terms and conditions of employment with other hospitalpersonnel, these employees uniformly have higher wages than service andclerical employees and have a number of bargaining interests separate anddistinct from those of non-maintenance employees, such as access to craftrelated education and training programs, tool supply allowances, safetyequipment and practices, portable pensions, and the like. Moreover, whileskilled maintenance employees do work throughout the entire hospital, theircontact with non-maintenance employees is brief and limited. Finally, thehearing evidence shows that transfers are rare in the industry and thatskilled maintenance employees have a separate internal and external labormarket.I. Conclusion For the above reasons, we find that a unit of skilled maintenance employeesis separately appropriate for collective bargaining purposes. Althoughthe number of employees in such a unit will be relatively small, theirwork bears little relationship to that of other hospital employees. Itis, essentially, a non-health care occupation involving skills, interests,and job markets largely separate from the hospital itself. For that reason,to require unions to organize and represent skilled maintenance employeesas part of a larger group of unskilled employees performing health-relatedjobs within the hospital is both unrealistic and inefficient. Hence, wehave decided that the final rule should provide for separate skilled maintenanceunits. The IUOE contends (IUOE Br. 9), and we find, that skilled maintenance unitsshould generally include all employees involved in the maintenance, repair,and operation of the hospitals' physical plant systems, as well as theirtrainees, helpers, and assistants. However, evidence from the hearingsshows that it may not always be possible to identify in advance those employeesproperly included in this unit, partly because employees performing essentiallythe same functions are classified differently in different hospitals. Thus,for example, in Los Angeles and San Francisco all employees representedby the IUOE in skilled maintenance units are classified as stationary engineersregardless of their particular job functions (Viat, 3457-58; Hach, 5318)whereas in Chicago, New York, and New Jersey most health care employershave retained craft titles for their employees. (Schloop, Chi II 203; Schloopaffidavit; Hach, 5318; Giblin, 5383.) In addition, many skilled maintenanceclassifications are subdivided by skill or experience level, e.g., masterlevel, journeyman level, apprentice, and/or helper. Among the employeeclassifications which should generally be included in such units are carpenter,electrician, mason/bricklayer, painter, pipefitter, plumber, sheetmetalfabricator, automotive mechanic, HVAC [heating, ventilating, and air conditioning]mechanic, maintenance mechanic, chief engineer, operating engineer, fireman/boileroperator, locksmith, welder, and utility man. (Health Care Occupations:A Comprehensive Job Description Manual, Chapter XXXII; Hammond, Exh. 12,affidavits of Bowen, Tighe, Chambers, Scheb, McWade, Scadden, Kelly, Schloop,Gindorf, Fox, Lane, Belfi, and Bess.) As noted above, sometimes relativelyunskilled utility workers are included, either if they are involved inthe maintenance, repair, and operation of hospitals' physical plant systems(Viat, 3460), or if they are part of a separate maintenance department.This list is not exhaustive; rather, it is illustrative of the types ofemployee classifications exhibiting the characteristics which the rulemakingrecord shows are typical of employees included in skilled maintenance units.Because of this variation, in some instances it may be necessary to decideby adjudication the unit placement of individuals in particular job classifications.However, this is also true with respect to technical and business officeclerical units, for example. It does not defeat the basic appropriatenessof the unit as found in this rulemaking proceeding. <ITAG tagnum="84">X. Business Office Clericals </ITAG>A. Introduction In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Board tentatively determinedthat business office clericals should be included in a unit of serviceand maintenance employees, rather than represented in a separate unit.52 FR 25147. Among the reasons for including business office clericalsin the broader service and maintenance unit were that they:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Often share many terms and conditions of employment with serviceand maintenance employees; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Have regular and frequent contact with service employees; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Are engaged in recordkeeping as are ward clericals, technicians,nurses, and physicians; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) Have not been represented historically by labor organizationsspecializing in representing business office clericals; and  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) Their inclusion in the broader unit will help unit proliferation.</ITAG>After carefully considering the evidence amassed during the hearing, contraryto our tentative determination we have concluded that for the followingreasons the business office clericals constitute a separate appropriatebargaining unit. B. The Record Supports a Finding That Business Office Clericals Constitutea Separate Appropriate Unit 1. <T3>Job duties and functions. </T3>Evidence from the rulemaking hearingsshows that although many hospital employees perform some recordkeepingfunctions, business office clericals perform substantially different functionsfrom those performed by other employees (WS Holtz at 8-9; WS O'Neil at1 andamp; 5526-29). Business office clericals are primarily responsible fora hospital's financial and billing practices (WS Winn at 6-7), and dealwith Medicare, DRGs, varying price schedules, multiplicity of insurancetypes, and new reimbursement systems (WS Schoen at 9; Berliner, 5599-5600).Increasing computerization of financial management has led to specializationand has reduced the clerical duties of other hospital employees (WS Schoenat 11). One argument advanced by some employers is that many different professionaland non-professional classifications use computers; 2/3 of the hospitalsare considering information systems technology which will enable nursesto enter and read programs reporting patients' test results, medication,and scheduling (AHA Br. 45 citing article in <T3>Modern Healthcare</T3>). Unlike these employees, however, businessoffice clericals do not engage in any form of patient care and are notresponsible for the patients' physical or environmental health (Wilkinson,4973-76; Bryant, 116-118). Moreover, although other clerical and professionalemployees may be utilizing information systems technology and video displayterminals (VDTs), and despite the existence at the University of Alabama(Birmingham) of a training program for ``clerical technicians'' who learnto do billing, perform blood tests, and take x-rays (AHA Br. attachment5), it has not been shown that service workers or clinical techniciansperform functions similar to those performed by the business office clericals,i.e., they are responsible for selecting, completing, or interpreting businessforms using computers, keyboard terminals, and typewriters. Nor was itshown that the University of Alabama program was duplicated elsewhere inthe country, or that any person from the program was ever placed in a hospital.(AFL Br. 77). Moreover, the evidence indicates that this program was clearlyintended for technical employees (Stickler, Chi I 37-38). 2. <T3>Education. </T3>Business office clericals generally are required tohave a higher level of education than service and maintenance employees,i.e., a high school diploma and specific clerical skills, and a majorityof business office clericals have some college background and formal clericaltraining (WS Nussbaum at 2; WS Cornfield at 6). Moreover, because of theincreased complexity of the hospitals' financial operations, includingthe introduction of DRGs, hospitals have begun to require more trainingfor business office clericals, and to require skills in such areas as programming,coding, abstracting, and billing procedures (WS Schoen at 9; WS Ryan at1-2). By contrast, service workers have minimal educational requirements,prior work experience is unnecessary, and they are not required to possessspecial business-oriented skills (AFL Br. 53; WS Cornfield at 8). Thereis some evidence that admitting clerks and medical records librarians receivevocational training at many of the same business or trade schools as purchasingclerks and accounts receivable clerks (WS Coney at 5). However, no specificevidence was provided regarding the type of training each receives. Thefact that some employees are attending the same schools does not establishthat they are receiving identical training. Consequently, we do not placegreat weight on this factor; in any event, whether some of these otherclassifications are also business office clericals is a matter we do nothere decide. Further, business office clericals undergo constant retrainingto update current skills or acquire new skills as financial operationsare updated (WS Holtz at 5, 9-10).3. <T3>Terms and conditions of employment. </T3>Although clericals often sharesome terms and conditions of employment with non-professional employees,especially benefits, evidence from the rulemaking proceeding clearly showsother, significant differences between the business office clericals' termsand conditions of employment and those of the service and maintenance employees.Salaries paid to business office clericals reflect their higher skillsand training; a 1985 BLS wage survey shows that business clericals on averageearn $2,000 more than the top service jobs (WS Schoen at 12; WS O'Neilat 3). Unlike service and maintenance employees, business office clericalsmay be permitted to smoke and eat at work stations, and have differentdress requirements and health and safety concerns. In addition, unlikemost service employees who work varying shifts and weekends, business officeclericals generally work one shift, 5 days per week. (AFL Br. 59; WS Nussbaumat 5; Bryant, 116-118; Booth, 3686; WS O'Neil at 2.) 4. <T3>Supervision. </T3>The differences in skills and functions are underscoredby the separate supervision of business office clerical departments, whichhas resulted from the almost universal centralization of business officefunctions (Berliner, 5597; WS Schoen at 9-10 andamp; 5173). The SEIU surveyof 250 facilities showed that at 100% of the facilities, business officeclericals have separate supervision. Although clericals occasionally mayshare supervision with other non-professionals (Briguglio, 5300), the evidenceestablishes that business office clericals regularly have a separate supervisoryhierarchy; ultimate supervisory responsibility generally rests with financialadministrators as compared to the ultimate supervisory authority for serviceemployees which rests with administrators overseeing patient care (WS O'Neilat 2; WS Holtz at 4, 6-7). Two examples were given in which clericals andother employees report to the same individual (Briguglio, 5300; Comment157, Halifax Medical Center). Nevertheless, we are persuaded that, withfew exceptions, business office clericals are separately supervised. Moreover,in one important respect, the nature of the supervision received by thebusiness office clericals is unlike the traditional supervision receivedby service and maintenance employees. Technology enables supervisors tomonitor closely the output of the business office clericals, measured inkeystrokes, paper output, volume of bills processed, time on terminals,and phone calls; this monitoring increasingly is used for purposes of discipline.(WS Holtz at 6-7; WS Nussbaum at 2-3.) 5. <T3>Interaction. </T3>Contrary to our original impression, the evidenceshows that business office clericals are physically isolated from othernon-professional employees and, therefore, have little contact or interactionwith them. (Dretchan, 5002; Bryant, 116-118; Booth, 3689-90; WS Nussbaumat 4). The ballooning costs of new construction, as well as increased technology,have resulted in many instances in hospitals' moving administrative officesoutside the health care facility into existing buildings at other locations(Berliner, 5602; WS Schoen at 10). Of 250 hospitals surveyed, 35% of thebusiness offices are located in a separate building, 25% are located ina separate wing of the hospital, and 28% are located on a separate floor(WS Shea at 17; WS McKenna at 3-4). Further, centralized processing ofinformation and the increasing use of computerized communication of datacontinue to reduce even further the potential for physical interaction(WS Schoen at 14). 6. <T3>Career paths and job mobility. </T3>Business office clericals havefew avenues of advancement within health care facilities; rather, theyhave a separate and increasingly well-defined external labor market (Wilkinson,4980; WS Ryan andamp; 4749-50). Business office clericals are hired almostexclusively from the external labor market, and hospitals hire businessoffice temporaries as replacements rather than using other hospital personnel.The external market also influences salary scales since hospitals competewith other industries for these employees. (WS Schoen at 11-12: hospitalsuse BLS wage surveys in determining salaries for business office clericals.)Consequently, while service employees generally remain in health care facilities(WS Berliner at 9-10), business office clericals look elsewhere for otherpositions if they are dissatisfied. There is minimal interchange, either permanent or temporary, between employeesin service, maintenance, technical or professional jobs and those in businessoffice clerical positions (Ryan at 1-2). Moreover, although one witnesstestified generally that some clericals receive training to provide directpatient care (Stickler, 16-17 andamp; WS Rhodes at 7), there were no examplesof instances where this had actually occurred. There would appear to belittle cross-over from clerical positions to patient care positions. Further,the evidence reveals that job mobility between service employees and businessoffice clericals is basically nonexistent and, with the upgrading of skillsand additional training received by business office clericals, it is becomingeven less feasible (WS Lewis at 2-3; WS Blake at 2; WS O'Neil at 2; WSBerliner at 7). In some hospitals, admitting clerks and medical recordslibrarians, and purchasing clerks and accounts payable clerks are interchangeableand may substitute for each other, and technicals and professionals mayhandle clerical operations on the night shift (WS Coney at 5; Comment 263,Huntsville Memorial Hospital). Nevertheless, for the most part, even clinicalclerical workers cannot shift into business office clerical positions withouta substantial degree of retraining and reskilling (WS Berliner at 7). Therewas testimony that hospitals prohibit or discourage bidding between thebusiness office clerical and service and maintenance positions; however,even where hospital-wide posting of vacancies is required and employeesuse their seniority to bid, there is little cross-over between serviceand maintenance employees and business office clericals (WS Shea at 18;WS Roitman at 1.) 7. <T3>History of representation. </T3>The appropriateness of separate businessoffice clerical units is supported by a history of representation separatefrom service and maintenance employees. For example, at 250 hospitals surveyedby SEIU, business office clericals sought representation in 71 hospitals,of which 46 were separately organized, compared with service employeeswho organized in 195; a survey conducted by NUHHCE of 200 post-1974 electionsin 100-plus bed hospitals showed 37 involved business office clericals,of which 33 were separate units (WS Shea at 15-16; Muehlenkamp, 4767-70).There are 92 separate business office clerical units represented by AFLaffiliates in private sector hospitals. (AFL Br. App. A). Local 1199 hadno combined non-professional units until <T3>St. Francis II </T3>(Friedman, 5035-41). Although there are businessoffice clericals represented in combined service and maintenance units(Stickler, Chi I 23-31 giving examples), some combined units may have resultedfrom an effort to minimize delay or to comply with <T3>St. Francis II </T3>(AFL Br. 70). The weight of the evidence establishesthat business office clericals predominantly have been separately represented.8. <T3>Bargaining interests. </T3>While all employees have some similar bargainingconcerns, i.e., wages, hours, and fringe benefits, business office clericalshave a number of different interests, e.g., pay equity, performance monitoring,productivity standards, career mobility, automation, and VDT stress, asopposed to concerns of service employees such as job security, subcontracting,economic survival, supplies, shift rotations, infectious disease, injuries,and patient care (WS Nussbaum at 3; WS Lewis at 2; WS Holtz at 12-13; WSBarton at 1; AFL Br. 64-65).Despite the differences, in some instances business office clericals havebargained jointly with other non-professional employees and contracts havecovered both non-professional employees and business office clericals.In 1987, Mercy Hospital negotiated a contract which included over 50 classificationsin one overall non-professional unit (AHA Br. attach. 15) (One classificationincluded such jobs as accounting clerk and lab department secretary andboth received identical wage rates and wage increases for the durationof the contract). See also Comment 162, AMI; Saporta, 5142; Comment 154,Michael Reese Hospital, for other examples. However, in some cases wherebusiness office clericals negotiated together with service employees andthe resulting contract provided for identical terms and conditions of employment,wages and upgrade negotiations often remained separate, and clericals haddifferent bargaining representatives. In one instance incentive bonusestied to receivables were offered only to business office clericals, andin others the contracts contained separate wage schedules for businessoffice clericals. (WS Holtz at 10; WS McKenna at 3-4.) At Roosevelt Hospital,although the union bargained jointly for clericals, technicians, and serviceand maintenance employees, the clericals had their own bargaining delegates,contracts for business office clericals and service and maintenance employeeswere administered separately, and there was no interchange of delegatesor exchange of grievance handling (Colbert, 5020-22). 9. <T3>Proliferation. </T3>Contrary to our concern, as expressed in the NPR,there was no evidence adduced at the rulemaking hearings indicating thata separate unit of business office clericals will lead to the proliferationof bargaining units in the industry. The admonition against proliferationof units was directed toward problems that might be caused by having manyseparate bargaining units, i.e., substantial numbers of strikes interferingwith the delivery of health care services, wage whipsawing, and jurisdictionaldisputes. There is no evidence that the existence of a separate unit ofbusiness office clericals would result in such problems. There were noexamples of sympathy strikes by business office clericals in support ofservice and maintenance employees, and no examples of leapfrogging becauseof a separate business office clerical unit. (WS Wynn at 3.) In one hospitalas to which there was testimony about separate units, there was no evidenceof jurisdictional disputes. (WS Gray at 4; Michael Reese Hospital). Oneargument advanced was that because a business office clerical unit willnot include all clerical classifications, e.g., ward clerks, there is apotential for conflicts between clerical groups. There was no evidenceof specific examples, and we accord no weight to the theoretical possibilityof a conflict. 10. <T3>Legal Precedent. </T3>Legal precedent supports finding separate businessoffice clerical units appropriate. The Board has recognized the appropriatenessof separate business office clerical units in every other industry coveredby the Act, and until <T3>St. Francis II, </T3>in the health care industry. See e.g., <T3>Armour andamp; Co., </T3>15 NLRB 268 (1939); <T3>Legal Services for the Elderly Poor, </T3>236 NLRB 485 (1978); andcases cited in AFL Br. pp 71-72. From 1974-1984, the Board did not findany business office clerical unit to be inappropriate (See NLRB Exh. 5,revised). Moreover, Senator Taft's industry-sponsored bill would have explicitlyprovided for separate office clerical units. In <T3>Baker Hospital. </T3>279 NLRB No. 38 (Apr. 16, 1986), the Board requiredthe inclusion of business office clericals in a unit of service and maintenanceemployees. In so doing, the Board found that business office clericalsand service and maintenance employees received the same fringe benefitsand were covered by the same personnel, salary, promotion, seniority, transfer,and disciplinary policies. The Board also found that there was a significantamount of contact between clericals and unit employees. The Board held,therefore, that there was an insufficient disparity of interests betweenbusiness office clericals and service and maintenance employees to justifyexcluding the clericals from the unit. After considering the substantialempirical evidence adduced in the rulemaking proceeding, we find it unlikelythat we would reach the same result. The evidence from the hearings showsthat business office clericals constitute a distinct group of employees.They perform substantially different functions, have a greater degree ofeducation and training, utilize different skills, are separately supervised,receive higher wages, have a number of distinct bargaining interests, havelittle or no interaction or interchange with other employees, and frequentlyare located in geographically separate offices. 11. <T3>Identification of business office clericals. </T3>The evidence fromthe hearings indicates that there may be other clericals, e.g., ward clericals,medical records clericals, physicians' secretaries, and admitting officeclericals who perform functions similar to those performed both by serviceemployees and business office clericals or else perform a combination offunctions such that they cannot be readily classified as one or the other.To date, however, the Board has decided the placement of these categoriesof employees on a case-by-case basis, generally excluding these classificationsof employees from business office clerical units. See <T3>Mercy Hospital of Sacramento, </T3>217 NLRB 765 (1975). There, theBoard found a separate unit of business office clericals appropriate, andplaced ward clericals in another unit because their work was more closelyrelated to the function performed by personnel in the service and maintenanceunit. The precise placement of particular classifications which may bedisputed in a particular case is, for the time being, left to the case-by-caseadjudicative approach. C. Conclusion Business office clericals share some terms and conditions of employmentwith all other service and maintenance employees, have occasionally participatedin joint bargaining, and may even have been covered by the same contracts.However, we are more persuaded by the evidence developed at the hearingas to their separate supervision, their different and specialized skillsand education, their minimal interchange and contact, their different careerpaths and job markets, their maintenance of a separate identity even wherebargaining was in a larger group, and, finally, the recent developmentwhereby more and more business office clericals are being moved out ofthe hospital to different buildings or facilities. We believe that theweight of the evidence strongly supports finding separate business officeclerical units appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Other Non-Professionals </ITAG>Based on our analysis of the evidence adduced, we have found appropriateseparate units of technicals, business office clericals, and skilled maintenanceemployees.

See section 9(b)(3) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">XII. One Hundred Bed Distinction </ITAG>The proposed rule suggested establishing a different unit configurationfor hospitals over 100 beds than for those of 100 beds or fewer based onthe Board's belief that hospital size (as determined by the number of beds)was correlated with integration of labor, and that smaller hospitals weremore functionally integrated than larger hospitals, and could functionwith fewer, broader units. However, the record does not support that belief,and the Board has concluded that its rule regarding units in acute carehospitals should apply regardless of hospital size. The vast majority of representatives of both unions and employers appearedto agree that hospital size is not well correlated with integration ordivision of labor, and opposed a rule differentiating between large andsmall hospitals. Examples of unions opposing the distinction were: AFLBr. 139-140; ANA 4919-20; SEIU, 5215; Hospital Professionals and AlliedEmployees of New Jersey, 125. Over 40 employers registered specific orgeneral criticism of use of a 100 bed distinction, including AHA, Br. 48;League of Voluntary Hospitals, 226-229, 254; Hospital Council of WesternPennsylvania, 4395; Comment 5, Holy Redeemer Health Systems; Comment 15,Methodist Health Systems; Comment 25, Bradley Memorial Hospital; Comment78, Greater Cincinnati Hospital Council; Comment 82, Humana, Inc.; Comment104, St. Francis Hospital. Experts in the field agreed with the parties'position (Rosen, 4663; McKinney, 5519-20). Only a handful of commentatorssupported the use of any distinction based on the number of beds. For example,Comment 11, National Rehabilitation Hospital; Comment 105, Mass. Hosp.Assn. A survey by UFCW comparing the number of beds and the staffing in hospitalsof varying sizes in five states showed a wide variation in staff size (UFCWExh. 6-11). For example, in New York State, among 46 hospitals surveyedwith 20-100 beds, one hospital with 20 beds had over 200 employees, onewith 21 beds had 50 employees, one with 20 beds had 209 employees, whileanother with 129 beds had 181 employees. (UFCW Exh. 11). In California,one hospital with 107 beds had 1011 employees, while another with 110 bedshad 299 (UFCW Exh. 6). In Illinois, hospitals with 77 and 91 beds had 279and 429 employees, respectively, while another hospital with 129 beds had126 employees (UFCW Exhs. 5, 6). Similar variations, and lack of correlation,appeared throughout the exhibits. Lack of correlation between number of beds and number of employees maybe attributable to specialization or the amount of outpatient services(UFCW Exh. 1-11; WS Willman andamp; 4500; Rosen, 4663; AFL Exh. 20). Thus,it appears that staffing size and patterns might correlate more closelywith the nature of services than with bed number (AHA Br. 47; New JerseySociety for Health Care Human Resources Administrators, 439). The AHA correctly noted that the Board's proposal for a 100 bed distinctiondid not clarify how it defined the term ``bed'' (AHA Br. 47). The recordshows that there are several meanings of the term in health care facilities.A bed may be licensed or unlicensed; if licensed a bed may be occupiedor unoccupied (AHA Br. 47; Comment 52, Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center).Hospitals may change the number of licensed beds more than once a year(California Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, 3229). Occupancyrates vary; a hospital may have occupancy substantially below the numberof its licensed beds (Comment 1, Lancaster Fairfield Hospital; Comment115, National Healthcare, Inc.: rural areas may have only 25-30% patientcensus). The number of staffed beds (based on average projected occupiedbeds and patient acuity) can differ from the number of occupied beds (Comment186, Hiawatha Community Hospital; Comment 191, Trinity Lutheran Hospital.)Beds may also include swing beds (beds that swing between acute care andnursing or long-term care) (Missouri Hosp. Assn., Chi II 265). The Board also notes that to the extent unions and employers addressedthe standard to be used if the Board determined to have a bed-number distinction,they rejected the use of 100 beds as an appropriate bed measure but didnot reach a consensus as to the appropriate number of beds to use. Forexample, some unions suggested using the definition of small hospitalsemployed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in calculatingreimbursements under Medicare, which is those hospitals with fewer than50 licensed beds. (AFL Br. 141; WS Sweeney.) The AHA suggested a 400 bedcutoff (AHA Br. 141), but other employers suggested 250 beds (Comment 169,Columbus Hospital); 300 beds (Comment 126, Arlington Memorial Hospital);450-500 beds (Comment 1, Lancaster Fairfield Hospital); and 500 beds (Comment11, National Rehabilitation Hospital). The Board's decision to drop the 100 bed distinction is based on the evidenceprovided by the parties regarding the lack of correlation between bed numberand hospital staff, the multiplicity of definitions for the term ``bed''in health care, the lack of consensus on the number of beds dividing largeand small hospitals, and the parties' general opposition to use of a distinctionbased on the number of beds.\25\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ We note, parenthetically, that the information we haveacquired as to the relationship between staffing and number of beds mostlikely would not have been acquired in an adjudicatory proceeding, andprovides further evidence of the value of rulemaking in obtaining industry-wideinformation unavailable in a case-by-case approach. <ITAG tagnum="84">XIII. Nursing Homes </ITAG>The only health care facility, other than hospitals, covered by our proposedrule was nursing homes. In so doing, we tentatively determined that theappropriate bargaining units for this type of health care facility shouldbe the same as that for small hospitals, i.e., (1) all professionals, (2)all technicals, (3) all service, maintenance, and c1ericals, and (4) allguards. After careful consideration of all the evidence presented at thehearings, however, we have concluded that the rule should not apply tonursing homes. To a larger extent than acute care hospitals, nursing homes vary both insize and type of service rendered. Generally speaking, there are threebasic types of nursing home facilities: skilled nursing, intermediate care,and residential care. Skilled nursing homes provide 24-hour inpatient nursingcare to chronically ill or stable convalescent patients, are state licensed,and are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. Intermediate care facilitiesalso provide 24-hour inpatient care, but care is less intensive and moreoriented to daily living. These homes are also state licensed or certifiedbut are eligible only for Medicaid. Residential care facilities meet onlysocial needs, not medical, and are not licensed. (Durham, 3164-66, 69,71, 83; Comment 155, Indiana Healthcare Assn. (IHA).) The facilities rangein size from 10-500 patients (Harris, 4294; Comment 284, Ryan). One-thirdhave a capacity for fewer than 50 residents, one-third for 50-99, and one-thirdfor over 100 (Harris, 4304). Unlike hospitals, nursing homes are populated primarily by the elderlyand provide long term care rather than medical treatment of a specificillness. Consequently, nursing home staff are concerned not only with theirresidents' physical well-being but also their social and psychologicalneeds. Accordingly, there is less diversity in nursing homes among professional,technical and service employees, and the staff is more functionally integrated.(Harris, 4294-95; Willman, 4501-02.) Generally, nurses provide a less intensive,lower level of care to patients in skilled and extended care facilities,and thus receive lower salaries than that paid in acute care hospitals(AHA Br. 6-7 citing <T3>Modern Healthcare, </T3>Jan. 3, 1986). In addition, RNs in most nursinghomes never administer oxygen or assist in surgery, and therefore generallyhave no interest in or need for acute care pay differentials or for specialization(Comment 155, IHA; Shepard, 4962). Also, there is for the most part littledifference in the duties of LPNs and nurses' aides (Comment 155, IHA).Both are primarily responsible for providing nursing care to patients (Comment155, IHA, affidavits of Miller and Price; AHA Br. 6 citing <T3>Modern Healthcare, </T3>Jan. 3, 1986). Indeed, almost no aspect ofnursing home care is in the exclusive domain of any one group of employees(Harris, 4295). Thus, there appears to be a greater overlap of functionsas well as greater work contact between the various nursing home non-professionals(Willman, 4501-02; Comment 155, IHA, affidavits of Townsend and Turner-Simpson).Skilled care homes also differ from hospitals in that a ratio of 50 patientsper nurses' station is ideal for nursing homes, whereas the typical ratiofor acute care units is half that number (AHA Br. 7 citing <T3>Modern Healthcare, </T3>Jan. 3, 1986). Also unlike hospitals, there are few professionals employed at nursinghomes, and of those, most are RNs who serve as head nurses or charge nursesprimarily performing administrative duties (Durham, 3190; Willman, 4501-02;Saporta, 5145-46; Bullough, 4656-57; Comment 155, IHA, affidavits of Davy,Townsend, Turner-Simpson, and Higdon). There are also few business officeclericals. In a typical 100 bed nursing home, the business office willhave one or two employees. In a 100 bed acute care hospital, the officeconsists of payroll employees, accounts receivable and payable employees,data processing employees, and others. (Comment 155, IHA.) Greater differences in the size and purpose of nursing homes have resultedin greater differences in their organization, regulation, and staffingpatterns. For example, in very large homes, business office clericals maybe physically separated from the home, and have little employee or patientcontact. In very small homes, the business office is located next to thepatient care areas and there is continuous contact with the patient carestaff. (Comment 155, IHA; Durham, 3166-67). Duties of staff also vary withthe size of the institution. In a small, 10-resident facility, the staffwill have overlapping responsibilities, and thus an overall unit wouldbe appropriate. In a large, skilled care facility with specialized units(see <T3>infra</T3>), more than one unit might be appropriate (Harris, 4298).In an intermediate care facility which also cares for the mentally disabledas a result of trauma, there may be a separate group of employees, suchas psychiatrists, who have distinct supervision and little contact withother professionals (Durham, 3170). Although most homes are regulated by the state, regulations with respectto staffing patterns and employee qualifications vary widely from stateto state (Harris, 4296-97; Comment 284, Ryan). For example, Connecticutrequires more skilled nursing care than Iowa, and in some states, skillednursing facilities must have 24-hour RN coverage. Seventeen states havemandated nurses aide training programs ranging from 20 hours to over 100hours. A majority of states have no specific training requirements. InMassachusetts, the activity director and the social service director musthave baccalaureate degrees; in other states, their formal qualificationsare less than those of a nurses' aide. (Harris, 4297; Comment 284, Ryan;Comment 155, IHA.) Also in Massachusetts, as in other states, homes mustbe staffed by LPNs or RNs, and they are required to provide substantialdirect patient care. In contrast, in Indiana, with lesser staffing requirements,nurses' aides provide direct patient care, and LPNs perform RN-type dutiessuch as distributing medication and assisting doctors. (Comment 155, IHA.)The nursing home industry is also in a period of rapid transition. It iscurrently undergoing enormous growth as the population of older personsincreases and family responsibility for older parents lessens. In addition,many long term facilities will increasingly offer nontraditional specializedservices, i.e., head and spinal cord injury units, intensive rehabilitation,sub acute care, Alzheimers, respiratory therapy, hospice care, nutrition,AIDS, home health care, and care for ventilator dependent patients. (Harris,4299; Comment 284, Ryan; Durham, 3161; AHA Br. 6 citing <T3>Modern Healthcare, </T3>Jan. 3, 1986.) These services require differentstaffing needs. For example, in most Alzheimers' units, nurses' aides receivepsychological training in order to respond properly to their patients'behavior, and LPNs are required to perform recreational, educational, andsocial activities that are normally done by service employees such as recreationalaides. A head injury unit requires many more professionals than are usuallypresent in a nursing home facility. An AIDS facility might need more counselors.(Harris, 4300-4301; Comment 284, Ryan.) The professional and technicalstaff in a specialized service area such as a coma unit may also be farmore integrated than RNs and LPNs who work in the nursing area (Comment306, Harris). For some or all of the reasons discussed above, numerous witnesses wereopposed to applying the rule to nursing homes (Durham, 3179; Harris, 4293-94;Comment 284, Ryan; Comment 155, IHA; Comment 155, IHA, affidavit of Miller;Comment 3, Jefferson Davis Nursing Home). Three witnesses would supporta two unit approach (Comment 22, Louisiana Nursing Home Assn; Comment 27,Jefferson Manor Nursing Home; Comment 34, Lewisburg United Methodist Homes).Several commentators thought the Board lacked sufficient experience withrespect to nursing homes to formulate a rule as to such facilities (IUOEBr. 2, fn 1; Durham, 3179; Harris, 4304). Board statistics show that only20% of the elections in the health care industry have involved long termcare facilities (Harris, 4302). Also, case-by-case determinations of appropriateunits in nursing homes have not caused undue litigation (Comment 155, IHA).In fact, to the best of our knowledge there is not a single published casesince the health care amendments in which the Board had to decide appropriateunits in nursing homes, and no party testified that it had experiencedproblems with case-by-case determinations as to this issue. In view of the evidence set forth above, we have decided to exclude nursinghomes from the rule. The evidence shows that there are not only substantialdifferences between nursing homes and hospitals but also significant differencesbetween the various types of nursing homes which affect staffing patternsand duties. In the absence of a measure of uniformity of operation, itwould be difficult to establish uniform rules with respect to appropriatebargaining units. It also appears that there is no need at this time fora rule with respect to nursing homes as there has been no prolonged litigationand no party has expressed any problems in this area. We, therefore, concludethat it is best to continue a case-by-case approach with respect to nursinghomes. For those facilities which provide both hospital and nursing homeservices, if the facility is primarily an acute care hospital, it willbe treated in its entirety as a hospital; if primarily a nursing home,it will be considered a home, and outside the rule. To do otherwise wouldfurther fractionalize bargaining within the facility, and cause more, ratherthan less, proliferation.<ITAG tagnum="84">XIV. Specialized Hospitals </ITAG>Some employers suggested that the Board make a separate rule for specialtyhospitals, arguing that they are neither acute care hospitals nor nursinghomes (Comment 172, New England Sinai Hospital; King, 4230-31). The evidencewith regard to most of the specialty hospitals which participated in therulemaking did not support a conclusion that there are fewer traditionaldistinctions between employee groups. However, the evidence demonstratedthat psychiatric hospitals, are, for a number of reasons, in a categoryapart, and the Board has decided to exclude psychiatric hospitals fromapplication of the rule. Initially, the industry's claimed trend toward one-specialty hospitalsis not supported by statistics. The AHA classifies 90% of U.S. private,acute care hospitals as general; of these, 98% are general medical andsurgical hospitals and only 2% are pediatric or rehabilitation hospitals.Nine of the remaining ten per cent are psychiatric, a category apart. (AFLExh. 7, 8.) In California, where the industry contends the trend is particularlystrong (Dauner, 3206), there are relatively few specialized hospitals (Silberman,3209-12). Most of the comments submitted to the Board from specialty hospitals apartfrom psychiatric hospitals did not argue that these hospitals should betreated differently from general acute care hospitals. See for example,Comment 4, Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center; Comment 10, National RehabilitationHosp.; Comment 123, Children's Memorial Hosp.; and Comment 303, Children'sMedical Center, Akron, regarding childrens' hospitals. Although Children'sMedical Center of Dallas (Comment 276) states that in that hospital RNsintegrate patient care with some other professionals, and Cardinal GlennonChildren's Hospital (Comment 271) discusses use of the team approach, neithersuggests that childrens' hospitals differ from general acute care hospitalsfor purposes of rulemaking. While Shriners Hospitals For Crippled Children(Comment 238) were unique in their method of obtaining funds and chargingpatients, they operate like other acute care hospitals, subscribing tothe same rules of licensure and accreditation. Two hospitals, Children's Hospital of Dayton and Children's Hospital ofCincinnati presented more details regarding the operation of childrens'hospitals (Testimony of Graybill, Sokatch; Comment 288, Graybill). Thereis evidence that childrens' hospitals have higher acuity and outpatientactivities than general acute care hospitals, and as a result have morefull time equivalent positions and higher budgets than comparably sizedgeneral acute care hospitals (Comment 288). There is also evidence thatRNs have a somewhat higher level of interaction with other professionals,for example, interacting with respiratory therapists on ICU units and transports(Graybill, 4183), working on special teams like bone marrow transplants,interacting with pharmacists regarding allergies, and tube sequencing (Comment288). Even assuming that respiratory therapists are professionals, a statusthe Board has rejected on some occasions, (see for example, <T3>Samaritan Health Services, </T3>238 NLRB 629, 638 (1978)), the interactionof RNs with other professionals, including presence on teams, is similarto that shown in other hospitals, and RNs' duties were not shown to bedifferent merely because they may work on teams. As in other acute carehospitals, most nurses in childrens' hospitals are directly or indirectlysupervised by other nurses (Graybill, 4147-48, 4164).Comments from rehabilitation hospitals show similar arguments to thosemade by general acute care hospitals: that there is increased contact betweenRNs and other professionals, that there is some cross-training and utilization,that teams are used, that a hospital has across-the-board personnel policies(Comment 172, New England Sinai Hospital; Comment 131, The Institute forRehabilitation and Research). These commentators did not request specialtreatment for their hospitals. Of course, to the extent rehabilitationhospitals may be long term, they will not fall within the parameters ofthe Board's rule, <T3>infra, </T3>which applies only to hospitals whose average patient stayis less than 30 days. Nor was there a suggestion made by commentators of other, non-psychiatric,single specialty hospitals that their type of hospital merited specialrules. For example, the Board received evidence from Springfield GeneralHospital (Comment 201) and Oklahoma Osteopathic Hospital (Comment 300),both osteopathic hospitals, in opposition to the rulemaking, but not claiminga special status for specialty hospitals. As noted above, the evidence received on psychiatric hospitals supportsan exception for this specialty. Psychiatric hospitals constitute a substantialportion (9%) of private hospitals in the U.S. (AFL Exh. 7). Even the AFL,the only union which took a position on psychiatric hospitals, provideda mixed case for including these hospitals under the rule. Thus, whilethe AFL argued that psychiatric hospitals which provide short term careare acute care hospitals, it recognized that there is evidence to suggestthat at least some professionals play different roles in psychiatric hospitalsthan in acute care hospitals (citing Albanese/Caswell, Chi I 148-165).Further, the AFL noted that the Board has treated psychiatric facilitiesdifferently from other hospitals. Thus, <T3>Mt. Airy Psychiatric Center, </T3>253 NLRB 1003 (1981), was the onlypre <T3>St. Francis II </T3>case in which the Board refused to find appropriatea separate RN unit. Finally, even the AFL acknowledged that the Board mightwish to exclude exclusively psychiatric facilities from the rule. (AFLBr. 140, fn.). The two main industry representatives who presented evidence on psychiatrichospitals strongly urged that psychiatric hospitals not be considered acutecare hospitals for purposes of rulemaking. Most of the evidence submittedwith regard to psychiatric hospitals came from the National Associationof Private Psychiatric Hospitals (Comment 307, Thomas) and from CharterMedical Corporation (Albanese/Caswell, Chi I 148-165). The National Associationrepresents a substantial majority of private psychiatric hospitals in theU.S. Charter Medical represents about 60 psychiatric hospitals. Therefore,the Board considers their evidence to be representative of psychiatrichospitals in general. The other employers representing psychiatric hospitalsagree that psychiatric hospitals operate in a distinct manner (Comment110, Charter Lakeside Hosp.; Comment 35, Massachusetts Chapter of the NationalAssociation; Comment 29, Glen Eden Hospital; Comment 120, HCA Belle ParkHospital; Comment 168, Camelback Hospitals; Comment 298, Palo Verde Hospital).The evidence showed that unlike other acute care hospitals, psychiatrichospitals do not provide patient care for the physically ill. RNs are notthe primary facilitators of health care in psychiatric hospitals. Manyprofessionals participate hands-on with patients. Regardless of which ofthree basic models a psychiatric hospital follows: medical, milieu, orcombined, the programs are highly integrated. RNs' work is closely integratedwith the work of clinical psychologists, counselors, social workers, andvarious types of therapists in a treatment plan as designated by doctorsand program coordinators. There are more professionals other than doctors and RNs in psychiatricfacilities than in other acute care facilities. The ratio of RNs to otherprofessionals is about 1:1 regardless of facility size. It appears thatnon-RN professionals would not have the same concerns about being outnumberedin an all-professional unit as they have expressed regarding organizationin acute care hospitals. Psychiatric hospitals also differ from other acute care hospitals in thatthere are more paraprofessionals (mental health workers), and all employeesare specially trained in relating to the patients as all employees' actionshave an impact on patient treatment. Further, the evidence shows that Congress has distinguished between acutecare general and psychiatric hospitals under Medicare by setting specialMedicare certification requirements with respect to staffing, treatmentplanning, teams, etc. For all these reasons, the Board has decided to exclude ``primarily'' psychiatrichospitals from its rule for units in acute care hospitals and to proceedas to them on a case-by-case basis. A number of acute care hospitals havepsychiatric sections, however, and such hospitals are not thereby excludedfrom application of the rule unless the psychiatric sections predominate.Nor do we adopt the suggestion of the AFL that the exclusion be limitedto hospitals that are ``exclusively'' psychiatric, as we deem such an exclusionto be too limited. See the definition of ``psychiatric hospital'' containedin 42 U.S.C. 1395 x (f). <ITAG tagnum="84">XV. Partially Organized Facilities </ITAG>In the first Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we limited the applicabilityof the rule to petitions for initial organization, and commented that ``historicallythe Board has required decertification petitions to be filed in the certifiedor recognized unit.'' (52 FR at 25145). By way of further explanation,the Board added that ``when institutions are partially organized we assumethat petitions for new units will follow the proposed rules, insofar aspossible.'' (<T3>Id.</T3>) As indicated <T3>infra, </T3>in Sec. XIX, Combined Units, the principle of <T3>Campbell Soup Co., </T3>111 NLRB 234 (1955), will continue to applyto decertification petitions. See also <T3>Westinghouse Electric Corp., </T3>115 NLRB 530 (1956). With respectto other types of petitions in partially organized facilities, we wishto amplify our previous remarks. In the Second Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, ``insofar as practicable''language [changed from ``insofar as possible''] is now part of the proposedrule. However, there are two different possible situations we can envisage:(1) Where existing units are in conformity with the new proposed finalrule, we can foresee no reason that new petitions, for the same or otherunits, should not also be in conformity with the new rule. (2) Where existing units are not in conformity with the new proposed finalrule, we can anticipate a number of questions arising with respect to theapplicability of the new rules. Where units smaller than those permittedby the rules already exist, may the incumbent petition for a residual unit?May another labor organization? What will be the continued viability ofthe principles enunciated in <T3>Levine Hospital of Hayward, </T3>219 NLRB 327 (1975)? In Comment 304,Kaiser Permanente raised a number of these questions, claiming that ``manyhealth care employers, including Kaiser Permanente, currently have bargainingrelationships with unions in units that are narrower than those set forthin the proposed rules.'' These issues have not been extensively addressedduring the rulemaking proceeding, and it is the Board's judgment that theirresolution should, for the time being, be deferred pending the adjudicationof particular cases that present these issues. The Board will, in the adjudicationof cases, attempt to apply the new rules to these situations insofar aspracticable.<ITAG tagnum="84">XVI. Facilities Covered </ITAG>The Board stated in its proposed rule that the rule would apply to acutecare hospitals, but did not define the term. Noting the concern of somecommentators during the Board hearings with the absence of a specific definition,the Board has carefully reviewed a variety of sources in order to reacha definition. In particular, the Board has extensively searched Federalhealth care legislation, agency regulations, legislative history, industryreference materials, and hearing testimony for an authoritatively basedand commonly understood distinction suitable to the goals of rulemakingin the health care industry. Research reveals that there is a commonlyunderstood distinction between acute and long term care facilities, butthat the terms are not statutorily defined as such. The Public Health Service, for example, draws a distinction between acutecare and long term care facilities for the purpose of administering specialprojects and grants (42 U.S.C.S. 296k(a) (4) and (7) (1985)), and for administeringgrants to nurse practitioners and midwife programs (42 U.S.C.S. 296m(a)(2)(A)(1985)). Various sections of the Social Security Act make the same distinction:e.g., for purposes of determining the scope of review of peer group organizations(42 U.S.C.S. 1320c-3(a)(4)(A) (1986)), and for determining the applicationof payment in accordance with state reimbursement control systems (42 U.S.C.S.1395ww(c)(1)(A) (1983)). Despite the repeated use of the terms acute careand long term care, however, no statutory definition is provided. In regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services,the agency principally responsible for administering health care legislation,there is also a distinction between acute and non-acute care facilities.The term ``like [similar] hospital'', for example, is used in referenceto the special treatment given sole community hospitals and is definedas a ``hospital furnishing short-term, acute care.'' (42 CFR 412.92(c)(2)(1987)). Finally, a review of the extensive legislative proceedings surroundinghealth care legislation and related issues likewise reveals regular useof the acute care/long term care distinction, with the terms ``short termhospital'' and ``acute care hospital'' used interchangeably. Here again,though, the use of these terms is so commonplace that no specific definitionis provided. In light of this commonplace usage, but lack of statutory or legislativedefinition, the Board has adopted the definition of an ``acute care hospital''provided by the Dictionary of Health Services Management, edited by ThomasTimmreck, Ph.D., 1982, National Health Publishing, Owings Mills, Maryland.The Dictionary of Health Services Management defines an ``acute care hospital''as a short term care hospital with an average length of patient stay ofless than 30 days. This definition was also referred to with apparent approvalby the AFL in this proceeding and is used by the American Hospital Association(AFL Exh. 20, AHA Guide to the Health Care Field, 1987).The definition of a ``psychiatric hospital'' for the purposes of this ruleshall be that set forth in 42 U.S.C. 1395x(f). According to that definition,a psychiatric hospital is an institution which:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervisionof a physician, psychiatric services for the diagnosis and treatment ofmentally ill persons; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (3) through (9) in thedefinition of a ``hospital'' in that statute [andSection; 1395x(e)]; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Maintains clinical records on all patients; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Meets certain staffing requirements found necessary by the Secretary.</ITAG>Coverage for the purpose of this rule, then, will include all acute carehospitals as defined. A hospital is covered if its primary service is acutecare, regardless of the presence of other non-acute care units at the samefacility. Psychiatric hospitals, defined above and dealt with in sectionXIV, are specifically excluded from coverage. Also excluded are nursinghomes. As previously indicated, rehabilitation and drug-alcohol hospitals thatmeet the 30-day standard are tentatively included as the Board did notreceive sufficient information during the proceedings to distinguish thesefacilities for the purposes of this rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">XVII. Decisions To Which Rule Applies </ITAG>The NPR suggested that the Board's new health care rule would be effective``on a prospective basis only, for petitions filed on and after (30 daysafter publication of the final rule).'' In <T3>St. Vincent Hospital and Health Center, </T3>285 NLRB No. 64 (Aug.19, 1987), the Board indicated that while its proposed rulemaking procedurewas pending, it would continue to make unit determinations in health carecases on a case-by-case basis utilizing the criteria set forth in <T3>St. Francis Hospital, </T3>271 NLRB 948 (1984) (``<T3>St. Francis II</T3>''). The Board also reiterated that it would applyits new rule prospectively only to cases in which petitions were filedafter the rule became effective. Based on comments received in the record,and upon further consideration, the Board has concluded that its rule regardingappropriate units in the health care industry shall apply to all decisionsmade on and after the effective date of the rule. Representatives of unions urged the Board to revise the proposed prospectiveapplication of the new rule. One union suggested that the rule should beeffective for all cases decided after the rule was published, even if thepetition was filed prior to that date (ANA Br. 197). Unions suggested thatit would be unsound, if not arbitrary, to disregard the rule in pendingcases, considering the vast body of knowledge the Board now possessed byvirtue of its rulemaking proceedings (ANA Br. 198, AFL Br. 145-146). TheAFL asserted that to apply preexisting law would deny employees the rightof self organization. The AFL noted that applying the rule retroactivelywould not have an ill effect on pending representation cases. The AFL alsonoted that the Board recently gave retroactive application to its decisionin <T3>John Deklewa andamp; Sons, </T3>282 NLRB No. 184 (Feb. 20, 1987), enfd.<T3>sub nom Iron Workers Local 3 v. NLRB, </T3>843 F.2d 770 (3d Cir. 1988).Further, the AHA and AFL noted that the Board applied its <T3>St. Francis II </T3>decision retroactively, and remanded many bargainingunit cases to regional directors for further consideration. (AHA Br. 203-204;AFL Br. 145.) ANA also noted the incongruity that could result if the Boardenacted a rule that conflicted with pre-rule standards, e.g., finding aunit inappropriate that previously was appropriate. (ANA Br. 204 at n.115.)The Board has decided that its rule on appropriate bargaining units inthe health care industry should be applied to all decisions made on andafter the effective date of the rule, which will be 30 days after publicationof the final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. See APA, 5 U.S.C. 553(d). The Board agrees thatit would be incongruous to apply the rule as originally stated; that is,only to petitions filed 30 days after publication. Such a rule would arbitrarilyaffect petitions filed just 1 or 29 days after the rule is published, andcould conceivably lead to vastly different results based solely on thetiming of the petition. However, the Board will apply its pre-rule standardsto cases that issue prior to the effective date of the rule. As we indicatedin <T3>St. Vincent, </T3>we deem it unwise either to decline to take any actionon pending petitions, or to promulgate a new standard while rulemakingproceedings are pending. We continue to deem it contrary to statutory policyto hold cases pending effectuation of the Board's new rule. Accordingly,all cases that issue prior to the effective date of the rule will be analyzedunder <T3>St. Vincent. </T3>If cases currently pending before the Board do notissue prior to the rule's effective date, the Board will not apply therule <T3>de novo </T3>to such cases. Rather, the Board will, where necessary,remand such pending cases to regional directors to determine the need fora hearing or other appropriate course of conduct in order to permit partiesto address the rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">XVIII. Non-Conforming Stipulations </ITAG>In the initial proposed rule, the Board stated that it would approve consentagreements providing for elections in accordance with the units set forthin the rule, and that no other agreements would be approved. Several commentatorsurged the Board to permit stipulated units even when they do not comportwith those specified in the rule. We have been persuaded that permittingnon-conforming stipulations, which are not prohibited by the Act, may,in many instances, better serve the interests of the parties, and perhapseven the Board. The Board therefore has tentatively decided to allow itsregional directors to approve stipulations providing for elections in unitsnot provided for in the rules. It is the Board's established practice in other areas to permit partiesto stipulate to the appropriateness of units and to various inclusionsand exclusions if the agreement does not violate any express statutoryprovision or established Board policies. See, e.g., <T3>SCM Corporation, </T3>270 NLRB 885, 886 (1984). This policy on stipulatedunits was extended to the health care industry in <T3>Otis Hospital, </T3>219 NLRB 164 (1975). The Board there reasoned thatit is consonant with the design of the Act to give the parties in representationproceedings the broadest permissible latitude to mutually define the appropriateunit. The Board stated that when the parties' perceptions coincide regardingunit appropriateness, in the absence of a statutory command or policy considerationswithin the Board's expertise, the Board is not the better judge. The Boardnoted in <T3>Otis Hospital </T3>that the legislative history of the 1974 healthcare amendments supports the application of general policy regarding stipulatedunits to the health care industry. Our expertise acquired throughout this rulemaking proceeding gives us considerablepause with regard to stipulations not in accordance with our proposed rules.Thus, stipulations in conformity with these rules would surely be preferable.However, we recognize the possibility that the parties have their own reasonsfor preferring to bargain in some other configuration. Moreover, we notethat the majority of certifications issued in representation cases in thehealth care industry following enactment of the amendments followed eithera consent or stipulated election and that these elections gave rise tochallenges less often than directed elections. Annual Reports of the NationalLabor Relations Board, Tables 9, 11B. In view of Congress' concern withstability in health care labor relations, the importance of reducing unnecessarylitigation, and expeditiously proceeding with elections, permitting stipulations,even when they do not conform to the Board's explicitly drawn units, seemswarranted. For these reasons, we have decided that the reasoning of <T3>Otis Hospital </T3>should remain applicable despite this rulemakingproceeding.To the extent a stipulation may later result in the creation of a residualgroup of unrepresented employees, the Board will address their representationconcerns as it would those of other groups of residual employees presentin partially organized acute care hospitals_on a case-by-case basis applyingthe rules insofar as practicable. Despite our tentative decision to accept non-conforming stipulations, weexpressly invite any interested party to comment further on this problemduring the period provided for comments. <ITAG tagnum="84">XIX. Combined Units </ITAG>The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking provided that, in addition to the specifiedunits, ``any combination will also be appropriate, at the union's optionand so long as the requirements of section 9(b) (1) and (3) are met.''The reason for the reference to the union's option was that the union,as petitioner,\26\<NOTE/> need seek only <T3>an </T3>appropriate unit. <T3>Morand Brothers Beverage Co., </T3>91 NLRB 409, 417-18, enfd. on othergrounds 190 F.2d 576 (7th Cir. 1951); <T3>Parsons Investment Co., </T3>152 NLRB 192, 193 at fn. l (1966). Itdoes not benefit an employer to have the option of showing that anotherunit, perhaps a combined unit, is also appropriate, or even more appropriate,since the appropriateness of an alternative unit is not the issue. <T3>Parsons Investment Company, supra; Federal Electric Corporation, </T3>157NLRB 1130, 1131-32 (1966). We therefore reject arguments by some employersthat it is unfair to give only unions the option of combining units. (See,e.g., AHA Br. 49; Comment 258, Durham, attorney for California Associationof Health Facilities.) <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ If the employer is the petitioner (RM petition), itspetition must seek the unit requested by the union. <T3>Wm. Wood Bakery, </T3>97 NLRB 122 (1951); <T3>Restaurant andamp; Tavern Owners Association of Salem, </T3>126 NLRB671 (1960). If the petition seeks decertification, it must be filed inthe certified or recognized unit. <T3>Campbell Soup Co., </T3>111 NLRB 234 (1955).  However, upon reflection, we believe that we defined too broadly a union'soption to seek, alternatively, combined units. In the NPR, as indicated,we implied that <T3>any</T3> combination of the enumerated units would also be appropriate;after giving this matter further thought, we believe that we have insufficientevidence at this time to say that, <T3>per se, </T3>all combinations will be found appropriate. We believethis is a matter we will have to decide in the course of individual cases,by adjudication. While there are some combinations that, while not requiredunder these rules, would obviously be appropriate, such as all professionals,or all non-professionals, there may be other, more unusual combinationsthat need to be examined for appropriateness. We meant to say only thatcombinations of the enumerated units are not thereby precluded, and wehave therefore modified the rule to provide that combinations ``may'' beappropriate. <ITAG tagnum="84">XX. Extraordinary Circumstances Exception </ITAG>The Board has, in order to ensure satisfaction of parties' due processrights,\27\<NOTE/> included in both the proposed rule and the  final rule anexception for ``extraordinary circumstances.'' The exception has been providedto allow for the possibility of individual treatment of uniquely situatedacute care hospitals, so as to avoid accidental or unjust application ofthe rule.\28\<NOTE/> However, the Board wishes to emphasize that while the ruledoes not, therefore, conclusively establish invariable parameters of bargainingunits in the industry, our intent is to construe the extraordinary circumstancesexception narrowly, so that it does not provide an excuse, opportunity,or ``loophole'' for redundant or unnecessary litigation and the concomitantdelay that would ensue. The Board has considered fully and at length allevidence presented and arguments submitted at the rulemaking hearings andduring the comment period. None of the referred-to variations between acutecare hospitals, some of which are enumerated below, are matters which wouldqualify for litigation under the special circumstances exception; rather,they are merely minor differences, inherent in the industry due to themultiformity of individual constituent institutions. The Board deems suchvariations to be ordinary, and hence by definition not extraordinary,\29\<NOTE/> even in situations in which such variations may be highlyunusual.\30\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ See <T3>Chemical Manufacturers Assn. v.

Helfant, </T3>421 U.S. 117, 125 (1975). Among the variations in acute care hospitals illustrated at the hearingsand considered by the Board are arguments relating to: (1) Diversity ofthe industry, such as the sizes of various institutions, the variety ofservices offered by individual institutions, including the range of outpatientservices provided, and differing staffing patterns among facilities (as,for example, a particular facility employing a larger or smaller numberof RNs than generally employed by similarly situated hospitals); (2) increasedfunctional integration of, and a higher degree of work contacts between,employees as a result of the advent of the multi-competent worker, increaseduse of ``team'' care, and cross-training of employees; (3) the impact ofnation-wide hospital ``chains''; (4) recent changes within traditionalemployee groupings and professions, e.g., the increase in specializationamong RNs; (5) the effects of various governmental and private cost-containmentmeasures; and (6) single institutions occupying more than one contiguousbuilding. Except as specifically noted elsewhere (e.g., exclusion of psychiatrichospitals and nursing homes from coverage by the rule), the Board has concludedthat none of the arguments raised in the course of the rulemaking procedure,including those listed above,\31\<NOTE/> alone or in combination, constitutes an ``extraordinary circumstance''justifying an exception from the rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ The arguments listed were selected by way of exampleand not by way of limitation, and were chosen merely as being illustrativeof the Board's intent.The Board is well aware that facilities will, and do, differ in some respects;however, as we observed in the NPR (52 FR 25144), it is the Board's consideredjudgment, after issuing health care decisions by adjudication for morethan 13 years, that acute care hospitals do not differ in substantial,significant ways relating to the appropriateness of units.\32\<NOTE/> Moreover, to the extent that the rulemaking hearings demonstratedthat at least in some respects acute care hospitals do vary, the Boardhas made a judgment that, in this area of establishing appropriate units,``[d]etailed analyses of all the facts of the particular case are justnot that enlightening,'' \33\<NOTE/> and that the policies of the Act would better be effectuatedby the establishment of appropriate units in the enumerated segments ofthis industry by exercise of the Board's section 6 rulemaking authority.\34\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ See, e.g., NLRB Exhibit 5, revised, showing that forthe 13 years since passage of the health care amendments, variations amongfacilities and their methods of operation had virtually no effect on theBoard's ultimate decisions reached following frequently lengthy, case-by-caseadjudications as to appropriate units. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ Subrin, <T3>Conserving Energy at the Labor Board: The Case for Making Rules onCollective Bargaining Units, </T3>32 Lab.

The Board, contrary to some industry representatives (e.g., Comment 148,Mississippi Hosp. Assn.), anticipates that litigation under the ``extraordinarycircumstances'' exception will be rare; the AHA, representing the largestgroup of health care employers in this proceeding, has indicated it understandsthat the Board intends to limit exceptions to ``truly extraordinary situations''(AHA Br. 55-56), and neither the AHA nor any other employer (or union)representative has raised objections to the Board's stated intent. In most instances, should a facility claim it comes within the ``extraordinarycircumstances'' exception, it should present an offer of proof to the HearingOfficer, who will then either permit the requested evidence to be adducedor, we anticipate far more commonly,\38\<NOTE/> refer the offer to the Regional Director, and, if requested,ultimately to the Board, for ruling. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ See 1 C. Koch, <T3>Administrative Law and Practice </T3>section 4.112 at 323 (1985). <ITAG tagnum="84">XXI. Proliferation </ITAG>As set forth in considerable detail, <T3>supra, </T3>the evidence taken during the rulemaking proceeding hasconvinced the Board, contrary to its earlier belief, that eight possibleunits (seven plus guards) should be found appropriate in acute care hospitals.In reaching this conclusion, the Board has carefully considered the Congressionaladmonition against proliferation set forth in the legislative history ofthe 1974 health care amendments as well as its own strongly-held view thatthe number of units found appropriate should not be so many as to leadto a splintering of the workforce into the myriad of occupations and professionsfound within the industry. The Board has examined the units found appropriateto ensure they are not so numerous as to create a never-ending round ofbargaining sessions, and that each unit represents truly distinctive interestsand concerns. A number of groups of employees found appropriate have separatelabor markets. A thorough examination of the record in this rulemakingproceeding has satisfied us that the health care units established by theBoard do not constitute proliferation either in terms of the legislativehistory of the amendments or in the context of the history or realitiesof the industry. We believe that Congressional and industry concern with proliferation wasdirected towards the fifteen to twenty plus units that had arisen in thehealth care and other industries prior to the amendments and the possibilityof scores of units if each hospital classification were permitted to organizeseparately. IUOE Br. 96-97: Legislative History of the Coverage of Non-ProfitHospitals Under the National Labor Relations Act at 113-114 (Senator Taft);Hearings on S. 794 and S. 2292 Before the Subcommittee on Labor and PublicWelfare, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess. 1973 at 175 (David Brekke, Colorado HospitalAssociation), 181 (O. Ray Hurst, Texas Hospital Association), 188 (WilliamWhelan, California Hospital Association), Sidney Lewine, 138-139 (AmericanHospital Association), 563-564 (exchange between Senator Taft and AndrewBiemiller of the AFL-CIO). See also testimony in 1971 and 1972 hearings,cited in IUOE Br. 96-97.By 1974, a number of state and agency decisions with respect to non-profithospitals, and Board decisions with respect to proprietary hospitals, hadpermitted each profession, and in some cases each craft, to form a separatebargaining unit (See discussion in AFL Br. 2-3, 28). As stated in SenatorTaft's proposal, Congress feared that patterns such as developed in constructionand newspaper industries_wherein units were permitted for each craft, resultingin 15-20 or more units_would result in separate units for the equally,if not more, numerous classifications in a hospital. We find no evidencethat Congress opposed a smaller number of units. Thus, Senator Taft's proposal,containing special rules for the health care industry, would have establishedfive units as presumptively appropriate: Technical, clerical, service andmaintenance, all professional, and guards, two more than the statutorilymandated three units (professional, non-professional, and guards). TheBoard's addition of three units, RNs, physicians, and skilled maintenance,raising the total number of proposed possible units to eight, still constituteshalf or fewer of the number of units that seem to us to have concernedCongress. Furthermore, the record shows that the hospital industry understood proliferationto mean a much greater multiplicity of units than is proposed here. TheLeague of Voluntary Hospitals of New York, an association of 54 nonprofitmedical centers, hospitals, and nursing homes, and the largest organizationof its kind in the country, supported the 1974 amendments because the Leaguewished to remove itself from New York State health care coverage underwhich there were potentially 15-20 or more units in a health care facility(WS Abelow). Indeed, the American Hospital Association proposed a five-unitconfiguration: Professional, technical, clerical, service and maintenance,and guards. Hearings on S. 794 and S. 2292 Before the Subcommittee on Laborand Public Welfare, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess. 1973, Sidney Lewine, 140. There is little evidence that the number of units proposed by the Boardwill result in proliferation or in the problems perceived to arise fromproliferation. The units proposed by the Board are only potential units.Indeed, two of the units, physicians and guards, are rarely sought. A successfulorganizing effort in one unit in a hospital does not appear to have a rippleeffect causing further organization. The record shows that from the 1974health care amendments until the Board's 1984 decision in <T3>St. Francis II</T3>, most health care units fell into the categoriesnow proposed by the Board. However, the majority of organized hospitalsonly had one unit, and about 80% had three or fewer units. (AFL Exh. 5p. 1; SEIU, WS Shea, Table 2.) Nor, as detailed <T3>supra</T3>, was there a showing that the configuration of units proposedby the Board have resulted in an increased number of strikes, jurisdictionaldisputes, or other disruptions in the delivery of health care services.Finally, as shown above, the empirical evidence submitted in these proceedingsstrongly supports the appropriateness of each of the units proposed bythe Board. For all the above reasons, we conclude that our proposal for seven unitsplus guards is not only well within our discretion, but also consistentwith both our own and Congress' concerns about proliferation. <ITAG tagnum="84">XXII.

The principal purposes of the docket are: (1) To allow interestedparties to identify and locate documents so they can participate effectivelyin the rulemaking process; and (2) to serve as the record in case of judicialreview. As provided in the first NPR (52 FR 25148), the docket, includinga verbatim transcript of the hearings, the exhibits, the written statements,and all comments submitted to the Board, is available for public inspectionduring normal working hours at the Office of the Executive Secretary inWashington, DC. <ITAG tagnum="84">XXIII. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>, the Board certifies that the proposed rule will not havea significant economic impact on small entities. Prior to this rule, partiesbefore the Board were required to litigate the appropriateness of a unitfor election purposes if they could not reach agreement on the issue. Uponenactment of this rule, parties will no longer be required to engage inlitigation to determine the appropriateness of units, thereby saving allparties the expense of litigation before the Board and the courts. To theextent that organization of employees for the purpose of collective bargainingwill be fostered by this rule, thereby requiring small entities to bargainwith unions, and that employees may thereby exercise rights under the NationalLabor Relations Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 151 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Board notes that such was and is Congress' purposein enacting the Act and the health care amendments thereto. <ITAG tagnum="84">XXIV.

(c) Nothing shall prevent the Board from holding additional hearings concerningthe specific job classifications to be included in, or excluded from, eachof the above units, and from establishing additional rules about such matters.(d) The Board will approve consent agreements providing for elections inaccordance with paragraph (a) of this section, but nothing shall precluderegional directors from approving stipulations not in accordance with paragraph(a), as long as the stipulations are otherwise acceptable. (e) This rule will apply to all cases decided on or after the effectivedate of the final rule. (f) For purposes of this rule, the term ``acute care hospital'' is definedas a short term care hospital in which the average length of patient stayis less than thirty days. The term ``acute care hospital'' shall includethose hospitals primarily operating as acute care facilities even if thosehospitals provide such services as, for example, long term care, outpatientcare, or psychiatric care, but shall exclude facilities that are primarilynursing homes or primarily psychiatric hospitals. The definition of ``psychiatrichospital'' shall be as set forth in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395 x (f), Social SecurityAct. A ``non-conforming unit'' shall be defined as a unit not in conformitywith paragraphs (a) (1) through (8) of this rule. (g) Appropriate units in all other health care facilities: The Board willestablish appropriate units in other health care facilities, as definedin section 2(14) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, on acase-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">XXV. Dissenting Opinion </ITAG>Member Wilford W. Johansen, dissenting: As amply documented in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 2, 1987, there has been no universalacceptance in the circuit courts of a standard for formulating appropriateunits in the healthcare industry. Some courts have simply substituted theirown judgment for that of the Board on the question of what constitutesan appropriate unit. Frequently a court has apparently supported its conclusionby a selective reading of portions of the legislative history of the 1974Amendments. The Board in turn has reacted first by trying to explicatethat the differences might be ``largely semantic'' (<T3>Newton-Wellesley Hospital, </T3>250 NLRB 409 (1980)), then by reversingfield and adopting the test advocated by the Ninth Circuit (<T3>St. Francis Hospital, </T3>271 NLRB 948 (1984) (<T3>St. Francis II</T3>)). That course in turn was roundly criticized bythe D.C. Circuit. (<T3>Electrical Workers IBEW Local 474 </T3>v. <T3>NLRB (St. Francis Hospital</T3>), 814 F.2d 697 (1987)). The Board'sreaction was to try yet a different approach_i.e., rulemaking. With all due respect, I disagree. Rulemaking in regard to healthcare unitsis neither desirable nor appropriate. First, it is my view that the appropriate method for resolution of questionssurrounding the interpretation of Congress' intent, the proper scope ofreview, and the Board's duty and authority under the statute, is to submitthese questions to the Supreme Court, which is the final arbiter on issuesof this nature. Submission to the Court is especially appropriate in thisarea. Second, the Board has received criticism from the courts at bothends of the spectrum. Most of the criticism and disagreement has centeredaround application of the traditional community of interest standard, versusa separately derived ``disparity of interest'' test for evaluating unitsin the healthcare industry. Thus, the Ninth Circuit, in an early <T3>St. Francis </T3>hospital case, faulted the Board for applying whatthe court deemed a too rigid presumption <T3>in favor </T3>of a registered nurses unit; and enunciated a ``disparityof interest'' standard which it deemed necessary for assessing healthcareunits. More recently, after the Board itself decided to adopt the disparityof interest standard, the District of Columbia Circuit in yet another <T3>St. Francis </T3>case, severely criticized the Board's action, andstrongly ``suggested'', that some form of the historically accepted communityof interest standard is required. Hence the Board is faced with some courtswhich have indicated a definite preference for the so-called ``disparityof interest'' analysis. Other courts are equally adamant that nothing inthe 1974 Amendments indicates that the Board was to abandon the communityof interest standard which had served well for the previous forty years,and of which Congress was cognizant at the time of the Amendments. It is apparent that the disagreements involve questions concerning themeaning of the statute, analysis of the legislative history, and the deferenceto be properly accorded to the Board's reading and interpretation of theAct, which is the Board's primary function and responsibility. These questionsare all particularly appropriate for submission to, and final resolutionby, the Supreme Court. This avenue is also the one which best serves theinterests of the parties, the general public, and the Board itself. Section 9(b) of the Act provides that<ITAG tagnum="21">The Board shall decide in each case whether, in order to assure toemployees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights quaranteed by thisAct, the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining shallbe the employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, or subdivision thereof ** *.</ITAG>I do not read the above language as permissive. It is mandatory. The Boardcannot satisfactorily fulfill its statutory obligation by relegating itsspecialized decisional function in this area to rulemaking procedures.That is not to suggest that I disapprove of rulemaking per se. On the contrary,I agree that rulemaking is desirable, and even a necessary part of theBoard's function, in some areas. This is not one of those areas. I believeit is important to keep in mind that Congress did <T3>not </T3>amend Section 9 when it enacted the Healthcare amendmentsin 1974. Had Congress intended that the Board abandon the decisional approachand utilize a wholly new procedure for determining appropriate units inthe healthcare industry, Congress would have told us so explicitly. Itdid not. Nor did it even implicitly suggest such action. The rule changescited by the majority (e.g. contract bar, <T3>Excelsior </T3>list, etc.) in support of this radical departure from50 years of Board precedent, (a) were arrived at decisionally, and; (b)did not involve unit determinations. There are additional factors which make rulemaking on particular units,at best, inadvisable. Units established by rulemaking will continue tobe criticized by courts that deem the Board's approach to healthcare unitdeterminations to be too rigid. Indeed, as unit specifications derivedfrom a predetermined set of rules are inherently less flexible than thosearrived at by decision in individual cases, criticism by some courts mayeven intensify on the ground that the Board has not arrived at a resultthrough the application of its institutional expertise to a particularfact pattern. Contrary to the stated expectations of my colleagues, setting unit configurationsby rulemaking will not in fact substantially reduce the amount of litigationin this area. It may serve to change part of the focus of that litigation,while at the same time creating more. The amount of evidence produced inrulemaking is not the point. The difficulties encountered over the lastseveral years have not been for lack of evidence. Rather, they have revolvedaround differing interpretations of the statute and, particularly, thelegislative history and the deference to be accorded the Board and itsexpertise in its role as the primary decision maker under the Act. I donot see that announcing rules by administrative fiat will resolve the divergentviews on these fundamental questions. We still will not have obtained adefinitive resolution of the basic issues which is so sorely needed. I would, therefore, vacate the notices of proposed rulemaking and submitthe extant issues to the Supreme Court for resolution.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated, Washington, DC, August 25, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By direction of the Board.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">National Labor Relations Board. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John C.
