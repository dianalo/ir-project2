A report to be released later this week by the AmericanAssociation of State Colleges and Universities proposed that halfof the increase in science education be used to upgradeundergraduate science instruction.   ``America will be a second-rate nation,'' said the president ofFlorida Aandamp;M University, Frederick A. Humphries. He pointed topredictions that there will be a shortage of 700,000 science andtechnology professionals by 2000.   Science education, he says, is in crisis.   ``We have to start channeling more of our resources intoprograms improving undergraduate science education and offer moresupport to college instructors committed to teaching science tocollege and university students,'' said Association President AllanOstar.   Humphries, chairman of the association's committee on scienceand technology, and other committee members said the report will bereleased at the group's annual meeting in San Francisco.   The report, partly funded by the National Science Foundation,predicted that channeling funds to undergraduate science educationhas the ``potential to be the catalyst for reforming the totalscience education pipeline of the nation.''   ``We must raise the quality of science education at every level,expand participation in science by all students and encourage morestudents to choose careers in engineering, science and scienceteaching and to do all that we need more money,'' Ostar said.   The report, ``Formula for Reform: The Role of the ComprehensiveUniversity in Undergraduate Science and Engineering Education,''offered three recommendations:   _Double the National Science Foundation budget within the nextfive years, bringing it to about $3.6 billion.   _Divide all new appropriations for the foundation equallybetween science and engineering education and research and relatedactivities.   _Develop a broad geographical base for the nation's research andscience education activities.   The report noted that President Bush has proposed that thebudget for the National Science Foundation be doubled and, whileenabling legislation has been passed by Congress and signed intolaw, the actual appropriations have not been approved. Theuniversities pledged to work for the money.</TEXT></DOC>
