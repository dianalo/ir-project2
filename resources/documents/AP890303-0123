North wasobeying its ban on helping the Nicaraguan rebels.   The former Marine lieutenant colonel became the first Iran-Contrafigure to be punished for his role in the affair. He was sentencedby U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. for his guilty pleasto four misdemeanor charges of withholding information from Congress.   Robinson suspended imposition of any prison term and insteadplaced McFarlane on two years probation and ordered him to perform200 hours of community service during that time. McFarlane couldhave received a maximum prison term of four years and a $400,000fine.   Robinson imposed the sentence and fine with little comment afterMcFarlane's attorney, Leonard Garment, called his client ``anhonorable man.''   ``The public servants in this country are not to be found to bemore decent and more honorable,'' Garment told the judge. ``Everyaction on his part .... was taken out of a high sense of duty, astrong sense of serving his country's interests.''   ``He stood up and rendered a faithful accounting of his publicresponsibilities when called upon to do so,'' Garment said,referring to McFarlane's admission in court that he misled Congressabout the Iran-Contra affair.   ``Mr. McFarlane and his family have suffered greatly and enoughduring these past years,'' Garment said, referring to the emotionaltrauma McFarlane experienced that culiminated in a suicide attemptseveral months after the affair was made public.   Urging probation, Garment said: ``If ever there were a case thatcalled for this act of discretion, this such a case.''   McFarlane, in his characteristic emotionless monotone, toldRobinson that ``Clearly, this episode in our history has renderedenormous turmoil on our country's processes.''   ``To the extent that I contributed to that I regret it,''McFarlane said of his role in the Iran-Contra affair. ``I tried toserve my country.''   The judge did not elaborate on the reason for his sentence,except to say that ``the nature of the offense and the totality ofthe circumstances'' required him to impose a $5,000 fine for each ofthe four counts.   Robinson said he would make further recommendations about thetype of community service he wants McFarlane to complete during thetwo years of probation.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh did not oppose Garment'srequest for a suspended sentence. Outside the U.S. Courthouse, Walshtold reporters his office ``made no recommendation'' on the sentenceand declined further comment.   As he left the courthouse, McFarlane said he has ``strong faithand a terrific wife and a free country. I am looking to the future.That's all I have to say.''   He had looked tense as he entered the courtroom, walking hand inhand with his wife, Jonda.   Robinson said he had carefully read the extensive submissions,including a statement by McFarlane, that were filed with him butwhich weren't on the public record.   The sentencing occurred in the same courthouse where North,McFarlane's former aide, is standing trial on 12 felony countsarising from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.   McFarlane is expected to be a key prosecution witness againstNorth and had asked to be sentenced by Robinson before he testifiesin the Iran-Contra trial.   On March 11, 1988, McFarlane pleaded guilty to four misdemeanorcounts of withholding information from Congress and agreed tocooperate with Walsh's investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.   McFarlane admitted writing three letters in 1985 assuring twoHouse committees that North was not helping raise money for theNicaraguan Contras or providing military assistance in defiance of aban on such aid that was imposed by Congress.   McFarlane admitted to a fourth count of misleading the HouseForeign Affairs Committee on Dec. 8, 1986 by denying any knowledgeof efforts to solicit money from foreign countries to help theContras after Congress cut off U.S. military aid.   Among the 12 felony charges against North are allegations that hedrafted the three 1985 letters for McFarlane's signature that weresent to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and theHouse Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs.   In opening statements at North's trial on Feb. 22, defense lawyerBrendan V. Sullivan Jr. complained that the former National SecurityCouncil aide ``is charged with crimes for letters that his bosssent.''   ``McFarlane decided to write them, but the government wants youto convict Oliver L. North for them,'' Sullivan said, suggestingthat McFarlane faces tough cross-examination when he testifiesagainst North.   Prosecutor John W. Keker told jurors in his opening statementthat McFarlane ``is still reluctant to take the responsibility forwhat happened'' and ``is going to blame Oliver North for lying tohim.''   Each of the four misdemeanor charges that McFarlane pleadedguilty to carried a maximum one-year prison term and a fine of up to$100,000.   The two letters that McFarlane wrote to the House intelligencecommittee on Sept. 5, 1985 and Oct. 7, 1985, were in response to thepanel's inquiries about news reports that North was helping raisemoney for the Contras and providing military advice.   In one letter, McFarlane wrote: ``I can state with deep personalconviction that at no time did I or any member of the NationalSecurity Council staff violate the letter or the spirit of the law.''   ``We did not solicit funds or other support for military orparamilitary activities either from Americans or third parties,'' hewrote.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the intelligence committee's formerchairman, testified as the first witness in North's trial, tellingjurors that he relied on the information that McFarlane gave him.   ``I certainly relied upon the information given to me by thenational security adviser of the president,'' Hamilton testified.``I thought that information was accurate, honest and correct,'' hesaid.   McFarlane, who tried to commit suicide in 1987 by taking anoverdose of a tranquilizer, played a major role in the Iran-Contraaffair after resigning as Reagan's national security adviser in late1985. He led a secret mission to Tehran in 1986 in an unsuccessfulattempt to trade weapons for U.S. hostages. McFarlane, whoaccompanied North on the mission, carried a key-shaped cake and aBible signed by President Reagan.   He also testified without immunity from prosecution during thetelevised congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra affair in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
