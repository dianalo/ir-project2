The only question is the timing,&quot; said Robert G. Dederick, executive vice president at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.    Federal Reserve officials, worried that inflation pressures are beginning to accelerate, are likely to tighten credit even further over the next few months, according to Mr. Dederick and other analysts. &quot;The Fed wants to make sure the economy doesn't overheat,&quot; Mr. Dederick said.    Prime rate changes usually lag well behind other interest rate moves. While not important to the nation's largest companies, which have other sources of credit, the prime still commands great attention because bankers use it as a base rate on loans to many small and medium-size businesses. It also is used as a benchmark for many types of consumer loans, including auto loans and home-equity loans.    The prime rate increase, which was initiated by Chase Manhattan Bank, had been widely expected because of recent increases in banks' own borrowing costs. Moreover, the Federal Reserve this week tightened credit a little more, pushing up short-term interest rates, in an effort to show its determination to combat inflation.    The federal funds rate has climbed above 7% from about 6 1/2% to 6 5/8% in late March. The funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans, hovered between 7 1/8% and 7 1/4% for much of yesterday.    When the spread between the prime rate and federal funds narrows to 1 1/2 percentage points or less, &quot;Banks typically raise their (lending) margins,&quot; said David Jones, senior vice president and economist at Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. By Tuesday, for instance, the difference between federal funds and prime had narrowed to about 1.4 percentage points.    Several bankers also argue that a prime rate increase was justified because business loan demand has perked up. They say this is another sign that further rate increases are coming.    Chase's move was quickly followed by Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust Co., First National Bank of Chicago and Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, among others.    Riggs National Bank in Washington raised its prime rate to 8 3/4% from 8 1/2% late last month, but the nation's biggest banks didn't move until yesterday.    Bond yields also rose as investors remained apprehensive about the Treasury's borrowing needs this week. Long-term Treasury bond yields, which were as low as 8.3% in early March, increased yesterday to about 9.2%, the highest since last December.    The Treasury yesterday sold about $8.75 billion of new 10-year notes in the second stage of its three-part financing operation. Today, the government will sell around $8.5 billion of 30-year bonds. On Tuesday, the Treasury sold $8.77 billion of three-year notes at an average annual yield of 8.23%.    Some analysts think the Fed may soon take even tougher action to keep inflation under control.    &quot;I'm not yet convinced the Fed's tightening has been completed,&quot; said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;I wouldn't rule out a 7 1/2% federal funds rate in the next 30 days, and therefore the prime rate could could climb higher.&quot;    Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., said: &quot;We generally expect as the economy continues to expand, there will be further pressures for higher rates with evidence of higher inflation. We'd expect federal funds to trade between 7 3/4% and 8% during the second half of the year and a higher discount rate at some point.&quot; The discount rate, or the lending fee the Fed charges banks and other financial institutions, is 6%.    Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve Board's former chairman, said Tuesday night that the U.S. economy &quot;has a good deal of momentum.&quot; But he also said, &quot;It is equally clear at times you can have a surfeit of good news in that respect,&quot; adding that the economy is getting &quot;close to&quot; full capacity. &quot;So there is a question of how much more we can grow&quot; without generating higher inflation, Mr. Volcker said at a meeting of the Women's Economic Round Table, where he received an award.    Yesterday's prime rate increase was the first since just before the stock market crash. But unlike last year's series of increases, yesterday's rise in the prime &quot;is symptomatic of a stronger economy and higher inflation, not a signal pointing to an economic downturn,&quot; said Mr. Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston. &quot;Just about every single sector of the economy is pointing up.&quot;    And unlike last October, which marked the start of three separate prime rate cuts -- the most recent Feb. 2 -- &quot;there are likely to be further increases in the prime to 9 1/2%,&quot; Mr. Jones predicted. &quot;An investment manager should stay in cash,&quot; because rising rates threaten both stocks and bonds, he said.    The prime rate rise isn't expected to produce a big windfall for bank earnings or to move their stock prices much.    Robert Albertson, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., said, &quot;The increase in the prime rate means absolutely zip&quot; for bank stocks. In a recent study, he correlated movements in the prime rate with growth or shrinkage in banks' net interest margins. In seven of 23 periods studied, bank margins moved in the opposite direction of the prime rate. &quot;That pretty much disproves the connection between rates and margins,&quot; he said.    Since Congress began deregulating interest rates, banks have greatly reduced the sensitivity of their profits to rate fluctuations through matching the maturities of their assets and liabilities more closely.    Moreover, at the largest banks, interest income plays a smaller -- though still vital -- role in earnings. At the money center banks, an increasing portion of income is in the form of fees, commissions and gains on trading and venture capital. </TEXT></DOC>
