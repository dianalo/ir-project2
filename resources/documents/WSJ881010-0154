Greenberger (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LATAM </CO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chile's vote to end its military dictatorship underscores the remarkable gains of representative government in Latin America during the 1980s. But democracy there is only skin deep, and its fragility poses a major foreign-policy challenge to the next U.S. president.    During the next 18 months, about a dozen incumbent Latin governments face scheduled elections. For most, a peaceful transition of power is an unfamiliar exercise. In many of these countries, voters are restive as democracy fails to ease the problems of economic stagnation, onerous debt and the massive corruption that accompanies the flourishing drug trade. In the wings, the military, which ceded power a decade ago in many of these nations, watches warily.    &quot;This critical period will test whether the current transition represents just another swing in the pendulum between military and civilian rule, or whether it constitutes a fundamental change in political life,&quot; Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of Latin diplomats last week.    The Reagan administration takes credit for the growth of democracy in Latin America on its watch, but it also shares some blame for its fragility. The administration's obsessive focus on the communist threat posed by Nicaragua's Sandinistas drained attention from greater threats to the region's far more important nations. Thus, while the Reagan administration was cheerleading for democracy, it gave South American nations a scant 3% of overall U.S. foreign economic aid.    In a report last spring, the private Inter-American Dialogue warned that Latin America's $420 billion debt is draining resources, blocking growth and threatening political disruption. In the past five years, the report said, Latin America paid out $120 billion more in debt principal and interest than it obtained in new loans for development. &quot;The political forces calling for suspension or even repudiation of debt payments are already gaining ground, while moderate and pragmatic leaders searching for cooperative approaches are on the defensive,&quot; it said.    Another shadow hanging over Latin America is the illicit drug trade. It funds guerrilla groups, corrupts governments and sours relations with the U.S., which tends to blame Latins for American drug consumption.    For the next U.S. president, dealing with these massive problems won't be easy. Vice President George Bush, the GOP presidential candidate, favors the administration's plan stressing new lending in exchange for economic reforms. But Latin governments are losing confidence in that approach because it hasn't produced results. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic candidate, supports a plan in which debtor nations and banks swap reforms for principal and interest reductions. A plan of such scope is untested, and, moreover, reducing debts for foreigners but not for U.S. farmers has thorny political implications.    But if conditions deteriorate further and the U.S. doesn't take the lead, there is a risk that the hemisphere's generals will. In many nations, civilians rule only with the tolerance of the military. According to a Brazilian newspaper report on a private conference of senior military officers from 15 South American nations, most of the officers remain profoundly conservative and continue to view their main role as fighting communist subversion, rather than serving civilian constitutions.    Some analysts fear a military coup in Peru if conditions deteriorate further. Argentina's civilian government also has been unable to deal with its economic problems. In Central America, Guatemala is the most likely candidate for a military takeover, says a senior U.S. official. The Guatemalan army put down a coup attempt by some officers in May, but that only underlined the civilian president's dependence on the military.    Moreover, if economic deterioration isn't stemmed, Latin armies may be invited to take power. &quot;If the economies get worse and there is a breakdown of law, there will be calls for a restoration of order,&quot; predicts Richard Millett, a political science professor at Southern Illinois University and Latin America expert. &quot;The middle class likes democracy as long as things are orderly. If there is enough disorder, they may choose order over democracy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
