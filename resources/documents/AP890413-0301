The 47-member House Banking subcommittee on financialinstitutions, chaired by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., passed thebill by voice vote after four day-long drafting sessions wadingthrough nearly 200 amendments.   The chairman of the full Banking panel, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,D-Texas, said he hoped to move the bill through his committee byApril 27 and through the House by the end of May.   Following a conference between the House and Senate, that couldput the bill on Bush's desk in early June, four months afterannouncing his proposal for solving what's described as the worstfinancial crisis since the Depression.   The bill would provide $50 billion over the next three years toclose or merge about 350 failed Sandamp;Ls and another $40 billionnecessary to meet government pledges made last year in the rescueof another 200 institutions.   The government would borrow much of the money through aquasi-governmental corporation, keeping $50 billion of the spendingout of the budget defict. With interest, the package is expected tocost at least $157 billion over the next decade, with more thanhalf coming from taxpayers.   Accompanying the money are a long list of what Bush has called``never again'' reforms.   The key reform _ requiring Sandamp;L owners to back their lending withmore of their own capital _ was watered down somewhat in both theHouse and Senate versions, but administration supporters said thecapital standards are a big improvement over existing standards andsurvived in much better shape than they expected.   ``It''s now pretty clear that a bill will pass with enough moneyto take care of the problem in the next several years and it willhave fairly tough capital standards,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer,D-N.Y., who was supporting Bush's proposal. ``It's better than Iever expected.''   The administration is still unhappy, however, with House andSenate provisions that would permit capital-deficient thrifts tocontinue growing. The administration sought to force weakinstitutions to shrink their operations or find a merger partner.   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., which under the bill would get expanded responsibility toinsure deposits in Sandamp;Ls as well as commercial banks, said thegrowth loophole undermines what are otherwise generally soundchanges in the capital standard.   ``We certainly see it as something that erodes the basic themeof the administration's bill,'' he said. ``It's really building theskyscraper on quicksand.''   The bills passed by the banking panels also restructure theregulatory bureaucracy. The chief Sandamp;L agency, the Federal Home LoanBank Board, will be split up. The regional banks which makelow-cost loans to Sandamp;Ls will be placed under a new independentagency. The FDIC will get control of the Sandamp;L deposit insurance fundand what is left of the agency will become an arm of the TreasuryDepartment.   In late action, the House subcommittee voted to give the JusticeDepartment $75 million a year pursuing criminals in the savings andloan industry, up from $50 million in the president's proposal. Thebill retain's Bush's proposed penalty of $1 million a day forserious violations of regulatory standards, but makes it moredifficult for regulators to impose the top penalty.   Earlier Thursday, the House subcommittee amended the bill byremoving barriers to the melding of the thrift industry withcommercial banking. It voted to permit bank holding companies toimmediately begin acquiring both insolvent and healthy Sandamp;Ls.   In deference to small banks and thrifts, which fear that thenation's largest commercial banking companies will be able to amasstoo much market power at their expense, Bush had proposed allowingbanks to buy only ailing Sandamp;Ls for the next two years and healthyones as well after that.   Reps. Stan Parris, R-Va., and Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, saidtheir measure was designed to attract new investors to theundercapitalized savings and loan industry.   In another move breaking down the barriers between Sandamp;Ls andcommercial banks, the subcommittee decided to make banks and creditunions that concentrate at least 30 percent of their business inhousing lending eligible for loans from the regional Federal HomeLoan Banks.   The also approved, by voice vote, an amendment forcing FederalHome Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall to be reconfirmed bythe Senate after his agency is wrapped into the Treasury Departmentunder the administration's restructuring plan.   The administration, in deference to Wall's former boss, UtahSen. Jake Garn, the ranking Republican on the Senate BankingCommittee, had sought to guarantee Wall the job through mid-1991.But Democrats, unhappy with Wall's decision last year to commit thegovernment to spending at least $38 billion to bail out more than200 Sandamp;Ls, want him removed.</TEXT></DOC>
