As a result, the chairman of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee, William Ford (D., Mich.), demanded in a letter to presidential counsel Peter Wallison that Mr. McKean be removed from his current seat on the postal board.    The lawyer Mr. McKean used was Joseph Califano, a former Carter administration official who is counsel to the postal board. The GAO report concluded that because Mr. McKean's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee focused only on his activities before joining the board, no &quot;official interest&quot; of the board was served by having Mr. Califano represent him.    The GAO recommended that Mr. McKean repay the agency for the fee paid to his lawyer, but didn't specify what the fee was or how much should be paid.    Messrs. McKean and Califano couldn't be reached immediately for comment.    Mr. McKean became involved in the controversy because he arranged a $40,000 loan for Mr. Meese, who later supported Mr. McKean for the postal board appointment. The GAO and the Office of Government Ethics investigated the loan and the Meese-McKean relationship in 1983. The Justice Department decided, after a review of those inquiries, that there weren't any criminal violations and further investigation wasn't warranted.    Mr. McKean last month didn't seek reelection as chairman in the wake of severe criticism of his role in an 1984 incident, in which he recommended that the Postal Service hire a San Francisco law firm that was a client of his accounting business there.    Rep. Ford called for Mr. McKean's resignation last November after the Office of Government Ethics said that in this case, the postal official demonstrated &quot;misunderstanding or complete disregard&quot; of ethical standards barring activities that involve a conflict of interest. However, the Justice Department decided that the matter didn't warrant prosecution.    Last week, Sen. Carl Levin, (D., Mich.), criticized President Reagan for failing to discipline Mr. McKean. Sen. Levin is chairman of the Subcommittee on the Oversight of Government Management, part of the Senate Government Affairs Committee. </TEXT></DOC>
