With returns in from 23 of the 98 wards, a BBC-TV computerprojection showed Sinn Fein, backer of the Irish Republican Army,losing ground to the Social Democratic and Labor Party, whichopposes violence.   The BBC forecast 109 local council seats for the SocialDemocratic and Labor Party, up 8 from the 1985 election, and 57 forSinn Fein, down 2. It forecast 20.2 percent of the vote for theSocial Democratic and Labor Party, up from 17.8 percent, and 12.1percent for Sinn Fein, up from 11.8 percent.   In the Protestant camp the BBC forecast 197 seats for the moremoderate Ulster Unionist Party, up 7, and 109 for hard-line Rev.Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists, down 33.   It gave the Ulster Unionist Party, also known as the ``officialunionists,'' 29.8 percent, unchanged from 1985, and the DemocraticUnionists 20.1 percent, down from 24.3 percent.   Altogether 566 seats were at stake on 26 councils, although afew wards have postponed elections for a few days due to the deathof candidates.   Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2 in Northern Ireland, and nosignificant change in the control of councils is expected.   Seventeen of the outgoing councils are now controlled byProtestants, and the rest by Catholics.   Sinn Fein's vote looked solid in its Belfast and Londonderrystrongholds but down in some rural areas.   Recent bungled IRA attacks which have claimed innocent lives mayhave been a factor. In Enniskillen, where a misfired IRA bombkilled 11 Protestants in November 1987, Sinn Fein local leader PaulCorrigan's vote fell from 2,360 to 1,781 _ a heavy setback in asparsely populated rural district.   Sinn Fein saw its traditionally strong support in Strabanefalling 5.2 percent, and in Cookstown it was down 4.3 percent,according to early results. The Social Democratic and Labor Partywas seen gaining about 2 percent in each district.   Sinn Fein insisted the IRA blunders were not a campaign issueand blamed its losses on voter apathy. It also blamed a governmentban imposed last year on broadcast interviews with its members.   The ban, which the government said was necessary to fightterrorism, was waived during the latest election campaign andreimposed immediately after polling stations closed Wednesday night.   Analyzing the early Sinn Fein returns, commentator ColinMacIlhenny said on Radio Ulster: ``In the really hard-core areas... their vote is holding up. In parts where they're in directcompetition with the SDLP ... their vote has crumbled.''   Tom Kelly, Radio Ulster's political correspondent, said: ``Theredoes seem to be a trend of the SDLP gaining at the expense of SinnFein, but also of Sinn Fein voters perhaps staying at home.''   Analyst Paul Arthur said on Ulster TV that it was too early todraw conclusions.   A gain for the Social Democratic and Labor Party would be takenby the British and Irish governments as vindicating the accord theysigned in 1985, which gives Dublin a say in the running of theprovince.   The accord aims to woo Irish nationalists to the non-violentSocial Democratic and Labor Party and undercut Sinn Fein and theIRA, which is fighting to rid Northern Ireland of British rule andunite the province with the Irish Republic.   No overall turnout figure was available. The final result isexpected late Friday.   One striking result was Laurence Kennedy's victory in theaffluent Protestant ward of Holywood, near Belfast.   Kennedy ran as a Conservative in a campaign to persuade PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party to enter NorthernIreland politics.   British parties have always preferred an arm's-lengthrelationship with Northern Ireland, giving the province limitedself-rule and its own parties.   Activists like Kennedy say this perpetuated a sectarian divideinstead of creating normal left-right politics and that the moldcan only be broken by mainland parties entering the fray.</TEXT></DOC>
