Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, a brigade commander, takes command ofthe military forces on Tuesday, replacing Gen. Adolfo Blandon, whois going to France as military attache.   Blandon, head of the joint chiefs of staff since 1983, announcedthe change of command within the U.S.-backed government in a localtelevision interview broadcast late Saturday.   The 48-year-old general, who had been expected to step down byyear's end, said his transfer ``is not related to the politicalsituation. It is necessary to open spaces for new generations.''   Ponce, 41, was singled out as an exceptional commander by fourU.S. Army lieutenant colonels earlier this year in a Harvardfellowship analysis of the Salvadoran civil war.   ``We cannot think that solely by military means we are going toresolve this war,'' Ponce said this year. ``Even if we kill all thesubversives, the problem will not end. Such deplorablesocio-economic conditions would remain that it (insurgency) couldeasily revive.''   Rebel and government negotiators have met three times, mostrecently in October 1987, in an unsuccessful bid to negotiate acease-fire in the 8-year-old civil war.   On Sunday, two rebel commanders arrived in Panama City for talkswith the Rev. Arturo Rivera y Damas, the Roman Catholic archbishopof San Salvador, on the possible resumption of peace talks.   Joaquin Villalobos and Leonel Gonzalez said they planned to meettoday with Rivera y Damas and the Rev. Emile Stehle of WestGermany. Stehle has participated as an observer in previousgovernment-rebel talks.   Ponce commands the 3rd Infantry Brigade and belongs to the``tandona,'' a tight-knit block of officers who have consolidatedcontrol of the armed forces in recent months.   Blandon will leave the nation with a legacy of a largermilitary. He increased its size to 50,000 troops and accompaniedPresident Jose Napoleon Duarte in meetings with rebel leaders.   At the request of U.S. military advisers, Blandon has increaseduse of small strike forces against guerrillas rather than sweepingoffensives.   More than 65,000 Salvadorans, mostly civilians, have been killedin the civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
