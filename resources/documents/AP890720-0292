The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it will spend $900million in the bailout. Texas American's 24 banks will open Fridayas branches of Texas American Bridge Bank, a bank created to enactthe takeover, the agency said.   Depositors, including those with funds that exceed the $100,000federal insurance limit, will automatically become depositors ofTexas American Bridge Bank.   The Texas American transaction raises the number of bankclosings in Texas this year to 95 and to 131 nationwide.   Texas American's insolvency was blamed on loan losses, losses inintracompany transactions and deterioration of the Texas realestate market.   Texas American Bridge Bank will be managed under contract byDeposit Guaranty. The new bank has total assets of about $4.2billion and deposits of about $4.1 billion.   Deposit Guaranty will sell stock and debt instruments to bringthe resulting institution up to required regulatory financialstandards.   The FDIC set aside $600 million in 1988 to assist TexasAmerican. The regulator will absorb losses on Texas American'sproblem assets, which Deposit Guaranty will manage.   Officials of both banks and the FDIC scheduled a news conferencein Dallas on Friday to discuss the transaction.   Deposit Guaranty is a $600-million asset, privately owned bankthat was built on the failures of other institutions. Its chairman,Ronald Steinhart, in May told The Associated Press he wasinterested in Texas American.   Before the Texas American transaction, Deposit Guaranty hadpurchased 13 banks, 11 of them in closed-bank, federally assisteddeals. Even when Deposit Guaranty acquires troubled assets it isprotected from losses by regulators.   ``We're buying essentially with problems fully reserved, so thatthe large proportion of our people can direct their energies tobuilding a bank and building a customer base,'' Steinhart said inMay.   Texas American and San Antonio-based National Bancshares Corp.were targets of an acquisition attempt by Minnesota businessmanCarl Pohlad last year. Under an agreement announced a year agoThursday, Pohlad's Minneapolis-based firms would have acquired thetwo bank companies with federal assistance of $475 million.   The deal fell through in October 1988 amid speculation that adisagreement was fueled by terms granted NCNB Corp. of Charlotte,N.C., which took over First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas.</TEXT></DOC>
