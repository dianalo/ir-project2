<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-22-0494 </DOCNO><TEXT>The paper on the Fradkin operator method consists of two parts. The firstis a universal derivation of the closed functional solution to the operatorCauchy problem for the Heisenberg equations of motion. The derivationis the most elegant and simple way of obtaining the path integral asa direct consequence of the operator quantum mechanical or statisticaldynamical equations. The second part deals with operator canonical quantisationof relativistic dynamical systems with first-class constraints whichgenerate an open irreducible gauge algebra of any rank. The general methodof constructing the unitarising Hamiltonian in relativistic phase spaceis presented.</TEXT></DOC>
