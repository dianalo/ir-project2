Heavy snow buried parts of Maine, West Virginia and the GreatLakes states. Some snowbelt areas received nearly 2 feet ofwinter's white by early today.   Schools were closed in two counties in West Virginia and innorthern areas of Maine. In Pickens, W. Va., 14 inches of snow felland temperatures dipped to 6 degrees overnight.   The frigid winds were expected to drop wind chills to 50 degreesbelow zero in northern New York and Vermont.   In St. Paul, Minn., the cold apparently killed two homeless men,police said Sunday. The wind chill dipped to minus 11 Saturdaynight.   At Miller's Bar in St. Paul, a man in his mid-60s who gave hisname as ``Hard Rock,'' said he knew the victims. He feared morehomeless would meet the same fate.   ``This is going to happen all winter _ people dying in thecold,'' he said.   In Agawam, Mass., where temperatures dipped to near zero, policefound the body of a 60-year-old homeless man outside a trailerSunday morning.   ``He had apparently tried to get into the trailer,'' PoliceOfficer Wayne Macey said.   The wintry weather was blamed for at least four other deathsthis weekend. Three people died in two separate traffic accidentson snow-covered New York highways, while one person was killed in acrash on an icy Montana road.   In Maine, Loring Air Force Base in Limestone reported 26 inchesof snow on the ground late Sunday. But an additional foot of snowmay fall before the storm ends, forecasters said.   The National Weather Service said some areas of New York stateeast of Lake Erie were expected to receive almost 2 feet of snow bythe end of the storm.   West Valley, a hamlet 30 miles south of Buffalo, received 18inches by late Sunday. The snow didn't keep everyone in.   A fund-raising event at the West Valley Volunteer FireDepartment drew 60 people, and at the West Valley Market a steadystream of customers filed by cashier Marcia McCabe.   ``We've had people coming in and they say it is up to theirknees,'' she said.   Squalls produced up to a foot of snow in northeastern Ohio andin western Pennsylvania.   In the Deep South, cold winds blew across Georgia. Temperatureswith the wind chill factor plummeted as low as 10 degrees inAtlanta. Winds gusted to 30 mph Sunday night in the Atlanta area.   In Florida, the season's most severe cold was expected to sendtemperatures to near record lows before warming later this week.Lows today should range from the mid-20s in the Panhandle to themid- to upper 40s in the Keys, according to the weather service.   But many citrus growers said they weren't too worried about thechill.   ``Actually, a cold snap like this can be quite beneficial,''said Bill Becker, chairman of the Florida Citrus Commission. Hesaid temperatures in the 30s accelerate citrus growth and put thetrees into a dormant phase, which make them more resistant tofuture cold weather.   Heavy damage occurs when temperatures go below 28 degrees formore than four consecutive hours, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
