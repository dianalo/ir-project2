The purpose of our researchis to study the expression of genes encoding {beta}-conglycinin, a seedstorage protein of soybeans. In previous reports we described the isolationand characterization of one such gene, that encoding the {alpha}{prime}-subunitof {beta}-conglycinin. Characterization included DNA sequence analysis,and comparison with comparable genes of Phaseolus and Peseine. A reprintof the JBC paper is included with this report. A primary reason for determiningthe sequence and for making the comparison with the phaseolin gene sequencewas to attempt to identify the DNA sequences that are responsible forregulating the expression of the {alpha}{prime}-gene. The comparisonreported in the JBC paper was very helpful; however, it was only comparativeand we then extended our work to functionally identify the sequencesthat are important for the expression of this gene.</TEXT></DOC>
