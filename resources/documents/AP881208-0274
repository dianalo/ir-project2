Sources familiar with the Drexel case said Wednesday that defenselawyers had expected the plea bargain by Cary Maultasch, a traderwho had been under especially heavy pressure by federal prosecutorsto capitulate because he had been threatened with numerousindictments.   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, alsosaid Milken was adamant about exonerating himself of any wrongdoing,contradicting press accounts that suggested he had wavered and evenentered into preliminary discussions with prosecutors about apossible guilty plea.   The defense was further said to believe Maultasch's disclosureswould not substantially damage Drexel or Milken, who have been underintense investigation for more than two years but have maintainedthey are innocent.   News of the Maultasch defection coincided with rampantspeculation that a decisive turning point was near in the protractedlegal travails of Drexel, one of the nation's leading investmentfirms and a pioneer in the market for high-yield, high-risksecurities commonly called ``junk bonds.''   Contrary to Milken's position, Drexel has expressed interest inreaching a settlement with the government over as-yet unfiledcriminal securities fraud charges, although any settlement wouldalmost certainly involve a guilty plea and a heavy fine, possibly inthe hundreds of millions of dollars.   Negotiations have taken place, but one source said both sidesremained substantially far apart as of Wednesday.   It was unclear what new evidence could be provided by Maultasch,who struck a deal Tuesday with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's officeand the Securities and Exchange Commission for his cooperation. Inexchange, it is expected that he will not face prosecution on anyserious charges.   SEC aides and Bruce Baird, the assistant U.S. attorney forsecurities and commodities fraud, would not comment on the Maultaschdevelopment in accordance with their policy of official silence onpending investigations.   Aubrey Harwell, a Maultasch attorney, was out of his office anddid not return telephone calls for comment. Drexel spokesman StevenAnreder declined to comment.   Drexel, Milken, Maultasch and two other senior aides at the firmwere accused by the SEC in a civil complaint filed three months agoof conspiring with now-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky tocommit a litany of frauds ranging from insider trading to stockmanipulation.   A Manhattan federal grand jury has been expected to indict thedefendants on criminal charges that would likely includeracketeering, which carries enormous penalties.   Some sources said that indictment was nearly filed last week butprosecutors delayed it, perhaps as a pressure tactic to extractguilty pleas from the defendants.   An underlying problem facing prosecutors has been their one keywitness, Boesky, an admitted doublecrosser and liar who settled thebiggest insider trading case in history by paying the SEC a record$100 million fine in 1986.   Without additional witnesses to corroborate Boesky's claims, thegovernment's case faces serious attack by the Drexel-Milken defenseteam, comprised of some of the best-paid legal talent in the country.   On its surface, the Maultasch defection was seen by someattorneys as possibly bolstering the government's case andencouraging others threatened with indictment to come forth tocooperate.   But others questioned why the government waited so long to strikea deal with Maultasch, suggesting it was largely a pressure devicethat was deliberately leaked to the press to amplify its effect.   Federal prosecutors also have been seeking cooperation for theDrexel investigation from partners in a much smaller firm, PrincetonNewport Partners, who were indicted on tax fraud and racketeeringcharges in August.   Lawyers for the Princeton Newport defendants announced Wednesdaythat the partnership had been dissolved, blaming the move on theuncertainties raised by what they called prosecutor threats to fileadditional charges.   Baird declined to comment on their accusation.</TEXT></DOC>
