Such a swap could kill any chance that Congress would approveexploration, said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of theHouse Interior water and power resources subcommittee.   Miller held hearings on a General Accounting Office reportreleased Wednesday that said the land swap, as agreed to by theFish and Wildlife Service and six native corporations, should beabandoned.   The analysts from GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, saidthe service had valued the swap at six times the appraised value ofthe refuge tracts, $539 million vs. $90 million, and would get muchland already protected from development or without much wildlifevalue.   The swap would transfer 896,000 acres of surface rights tonative holdings in seven refuges to the Fish and Wildlife Servicein exchange for mineral rights to 160,000 acres in the ArcticNational Wildlife Refuge on the state's northeastern coast.   The department claims it would still hold about two-thirds thevalue of the oil, if any is there.   The Interior Department has defended the exchange in a 20-pagetechnical critique, calling the GAO report full of errors andmisunderstandings, and has promised an even more detailed response.But Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel wrote Congress last month hehad decided not to proceed with the required environmental impactstatement, which requires public hearings, for the moment.   Robert E. Gilmore, Alaska regional director of the Fish andWildlife Service when the exchange was negotiated last year and nowassistant to the director in Washington, told the subcommitteeamong other things that the appraised values suffer from ``a fatalflaw:'' Congress forbade the use of condemnation proceedings.   ``I feel the taxpayers are getting an excellent bargain,considering the fact there's no assurance there's oil'' under theArctic National Wildlife Refuge,'' Gilmore said.   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, commented, ``That means (the nativecorporations) have got an 81 percent chance of not gettinganything.''   The department has estimated there is a 19 percent chance offinding oil, and if any is there, there is a 50 percent chance thatthe field would total 3.2 billion barrels and a 5 percent chance of9 billion barrels, as large as the Prudhoe Bay field about 100miles away.   ``This never was designed to be a resource management system,''Miller said at the close of Gilmore's testimony. ``This wasdesigned to be a lobbying system ... to generate support foropening up'' the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.   ``That's why the economics stink. It's a very, very cynicalapproach to this issue,'' Miller continued.   ``If there's an insistence that this is part of the bargain,then it is fatal to those deliberations. This is so far outside therealm of the public interest that Congress can't possibly acceptit.''   Asked in the hallway if he wanted to respond, Gilmore said,``Since he didn't give me the opportunity to, I don't choose tonow.'' He said he was ``a little frazzled'' by Miller's attacks.   Asked if the trade were part of a plan to generate lobbyingsupport, Interior Department spokesman Alan Levitt said, ``It'snot.''</TEXT></DOC>
