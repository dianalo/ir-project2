The 24-year-old airline stewardess took 680,000 yen, worth about$5,200, from a low-interest savings account. She bought 1,000shares, and in less than a month, the share price soared by nearly40 percent.   ``The salesman convinced me that the rise of the share price waspromised because he had reliable insider information about thecompany which is not available to the public,'' she said.   Ms. Kamimura's profit is an example of Japan's traditionalacceptance of insider trading, which in other financial centers isconsidered an unfair strategy for profiting in stocks through theuse of confidential information.   But Japan is under intensifying pressure to abandon sometraditional practices and adopt standards accepted in New York andLondon as the Tokyo exchange has grown into the world's largeststock market.   Foreign and some domestic investors are urging the government totake tougher measures against dubious practices, warning that theTokyo market will lose credibility with foreign investors, whosepresence in Tokyo is rapidly growing.   As a result of these pressures and recent scandals, thegovernment is tightening a weak law on insider trading andexpanding restrictions on securities firms and banks.   Among the scandals:   _ Last September, Hyogo Sogo Bank of Osaka was suspected ofinsider trading when it hastily sold large holdings of TatehoChemical shares prior to the announcement that Tateho had lostseveral million dollars speculating on bond futures.   Later, it was learned that Tateho had revealed the loss to HyogoSogo Bank, its creditor, before the public announcement.   _ In July, the political and business worlds were shocked whenaides to top leaders including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita andFinance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa were found to have earned up to$800,000 by trading unlisted shares of a real estate company,Recruit Cosmos Co.   _ Also in July, massive insider trading was suspected when theshare price of Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing Co. jumped hours beforeit was announced that Nippon Steel Co., the world's largeststeelmaker, had acquired a stake in Sankyo.   Both the Finance Ministry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange areinvestigating the case, and it has been revealed that a largenumber of employees of both companies bought Sankyo shares beforethe deal was made public.   Shortly after the Tateho case broke, the Finance Ministrydecided to revise the Securities and Exchange Law and significantlyenlarge the ministry's investigatory and surveillance functions onstock dealings.   The Diet, the Japanese parliament, passed the revised law in Mayand it will be implemented by October. For the first time, criminalpunishment was introduced for insider trading; that provision is totake effect next April.   David Ruder, chairman of the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission, said while visiting Tokyo in February that the billcovered ``98 percent of what we cover in the United States ofillegal trading.''   Keisuke Matsuura, a private investment consultant who hasfollowed the Japanese stock market for more than 30 years, said thedisclosure of the Recruit Cosmos case, with its links to toppolitical aides, was itself a sign of change.   ``Five years ago, behind-the-door dealings like these wereroutinely practiced but they were never revealed,'' Matsuura said.   Meanwhile, the securities industry is taking steps againstinsider trading.   Nomura Securities Co., the largest securities house in Japan andone of the largest in the world, recently announced that it isseparating corporate and investment sections and will block theflow of information between the two _ a barrier known in theinvestment trade as the ``Chinese Wall.'' It's intended to block amajor potential source of inside information.   Earlier this month, the Tokyo Stock Exchange requested membercompanies to streamline the disclosure process and asked for theprompt release of corporate information which may affect shareprices.   Despite such favorable signs, many market participants believethe dominance of traditions and customs won't change easily bysimply establishing new rules and restrictive measures.   ``The mentality of the investors and stockbrokers has to bechanged drastically if insider trading is to be stopped,'' saidMatsuura, who is also familiar with overseas stock markets.   Keiichi Nishida at Kidder Peabody andamp; Co.'s Tokyo officecommented: ``All those changes we hear lately seem to be justbluffs.''   Nishida, who worked for Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. untilrecently, believes it will require what he called a near miracle tochange the fundamental nature of the Japanese stock market.   Interviews with brokers and officials at securities firms, whospoke only on condition of anonymity, showed how hard it will be tochange the tradition of insider trading.   ``I can't recommend my clients what to buy if I have no insiderinformation at all, and my clients won't buy shares if I can't givethem useful information,'' said a broker at one of the top foursecurities firms in Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
