For self-described Maoists, two of their other targets were interesting: the Chinese Embassy and the Lima bureau of China's Xinhua News Agency.    A reporter might call that a story delivered to the door. But despite the fact that nothing is in less demand than yesterday's bomb item, it took Xinhua more than two days to move the news on its English international wire.    What happened between the bombing of Xinhua's Lima bureau and the story rolling up on its wire -- long after Western agencies considered the item dead -- is a study in how a lumbering bureaucracy goes about the news business. For the Xinhua brass want the Chinese news agency to be going head-to-head with the likes of Reuters and the Associated Press by 1995.    Director of the international news division and former Paris bureau chief, Yang Qi, says the idea is to build a &quot;world class&quot; agency with a Third World outlook and &quot;Chinese characteristics,&quot; a buzz phrase often used to describe Beijing's brand of socialism. The trouble is that Xinhua tries to run a service for foreign readers in the same way the state runs the media at home -- as if it has a monopoly on the news. That leads to a big credibility problem.    The world plan, hatched in 1983, is to ditch the Soviet style of official journalism and create an agency that will be read for its quality, not just its government link. There has been some progress. The international division's 93 foreign bureaus now generate an average of 150 stories a day, which go to 252 subscribers abroad. According to in-house statistics, Xinhua rivals AP and Reuters in Latin America, where the agency has 81 customers. Xinhua's pickup rate, the number of stories used by other media, has surpassed that of Tass in Africa.    Nice numbers, but the agency is still so slow that even China's official English-language paper, the China Daily, relies very little on Xinhua to fill its world page, preferring the Western news agencies instead. Making Xinhua competitive will be no mean feat. Some of the problems are small, such as the reluctance of Beijing editors to wake up correspondents in far-off time zones when there is a problem with a story. And there is the socialist media obsession with items about handshakes, official dinners, tractor production and &quot;friendly cooperation.&quot; But other stumbling blocks on the way to being a world-class news agency are not so simple, because they're held in place by a half-century of political inertia.    Xinhua was founded by Mao Tse-tung's Communists in 1931, when its first piece of hardware was a radio captured from Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists. This year the agency, which has more than 400 correspondents abroad, upgraded its international news room in Beijing with about $200,000 worth of computers from West Germany; next year will see a new, $27 million office tower sewn together with optical fibers and topped with satellite dishes. But high-tech is no panacea. Some Xinhua staffers privately wonder if the agency ever can shake its propaganda-machine image.    &quot;We don't have any guys like Liu Binyan around here,&quot; says one young editor in Beijing, referring to the People's Daily investigative reporter purged from the party last year for &quot;bourgeois liberalism&quot; after the student demonstrations. It is risky to be anything but a hack reporter in China.    On paper, Xinhua is an independent government agency. It is fashionable in party boss Zhao Ziyang's China to talk about reforms to separate party and state, and in these increasingly technocratic times in Beijing many realize that party cadres -- a fixture in all enterprises since 1949 -- are often a wrench in the works. When you're putting up a church, do you hire Christians or carpenters?    Xinhua has the carpenters. There are a number of competent correspondents abroad, writing in English, French, Spanish, Arabic or Russian and speaking many more languages. They attend foreign journalism schools and are trained by Britain's Thomson Foundation right at the agency headquarters in Beijing. What many of these newsmen would like to do and what winds up on the wire, however, are two different things.    &quot;There is still strong political interference,&quot; says one 10-year employee. Top editors are predominantly party members, and stories always are checked for politics before going on the wire. That's a slow process, the kiss of death in the news business.    Says Deputy Director General Pang Bingan: &quot;We are trying to do two things at the same time, demonstrate the party line and independently report world affairs . . . that's easy to say, but difficult to carry out.&quot;    It might be impossible. Xinhua's international reporting is unreliable because foreign policy often gets in the way, such as its reporting on the situation in Cambodia and Vietnam. Domestic news reporting suffers too. During the student unrest of December 1986, sub-editors in the international news room could be found listening to the Voice of America for news. In some instances, the U.S. government radio was telling Chinese newsmen about events taking place in Tiananmen Square, two subway stops from Xinhua headquarters. That's because the newsmen couldn't rely on their own employer for coverage of China's biggest spontaneous political event in years.    Agency directors now admit Xinhua looked bad during the student demonstrations. Xinhua was silent for almost two weeks after the first protests in Anhui and Hubei provinces. Its first report of a demonstration came Dec. 20, the second day of unrest in Shanghai. &quot;Our reporting on the student movement was not timely enough,&quot; concedes Mr. Pang, who was once a Xinhua correspondent in Cuba and Brazil.    Mr. Pang is quick to point out that Xinhua was faster reporting the anti-Chinese riots in Tibet last October, when Beijing chucked the foreign press out of Lhasa. He's right: Coverage was much more timely, but predictably the only Tibetan voices in Xinhua dispatches were those willing to denounce the &quot;sinister aims&quot; of the Dalai Lama's &quot;clique.&quot;    &quot;We have to get in order gradually,&quot; says Mr. Pang. &quot;{The problems} are like a box full of crabs, they get entangled with one another. We have some degree of difficulty here. We have different habits, different psychology.&quot;    Xinhua has a lot of things to sort out on its way to 1995, and it might be expecting too much to ask an official news agency to ever change its style. But unless it does, Xinhua will remain the place to look for the party line on domestic issues and to read between the lines for Chinese foreign policy. And seldom the place to look for the news.    ---   Mr. Grimmer, a former Xinhua staffer, is a lecturer at the International Journalism Program of Fudan University. </TEXT></DOC>
