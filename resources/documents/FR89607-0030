Theassessment provides a basis for the conclusion that the field testing ofthese genetically engineered soybean plants will not present a risk ofintrouction or dissemination of a plant pest and will not have any signficantimpact on the quality of the human environment.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plan Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an enviromental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the enviornment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).    Monsanto Agricultural Company, St. Louis, Missouri, has submitted an applicationfor a permit for release into the environment, to field test soybean plantsgenetically engineered to express a modified 5-enolpyruvyl-3 phosphoshikimate(EPSP) synthase, which is intended to make the plants tolerant to the herbicideglyphosate. The field trial is to take place in Jersey County, Illinois.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environmental of releasing the soybean plants under conditions describedin the Monsanto Agricultural Company application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environement. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Monsanto Agricultural Company, as well asa review of other relevant literature, provided the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing. The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment. 1. A gene encoding a modified 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthasewhich is not inhibited by the herbicide glyphosate has been inserted intothe soybean chromosome. In nature, chromosomal genetic material can onlybe transferred to other sexually compatible plants by cross-pollination.In this field trial, the introduced gene cannot spread to other plantsby cross-pollination because the field test plot is a sufficient distancefrom any sexually compatible plants with which it might cross-pollinate.2. Neither the 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosposhikimate synthase gene itself, norits gene product, confer on soybean any plant pest characteristics. Traitsthat lead to weediness in plants are polygenic traits and cannot be conferredby adding a single gene.  3. The plant from which the 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthase genewas isolated is not a plant pest.    4. The 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthase gene does not providethe transformed soybean plants with any measureable selective advantageover nontransformed soybean plants in the ability to be disseminated orto become established in the environment.   5. The vector used to transfer the 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthasegene to soybean plants has been evaluated for its use in this specificexperiment and does not pose a plant pest risk in this experiment. Thevector, although derived from a DNA sequence with known plant pest potential,has been disarmed; that is, genes that are necessary for producing plantdisease have been removed from the vector. The vector has been tested andshown to be nonpathogenic to plants.  6. The vector agent, the bacterium that was used to deliver the vectorDNA and the 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthase gene into the plantcell, has been shown to be eliminated and no longer associated with thetransformed soybean plants.    7. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering the gene to the plant genome (i.e., chromosomal DNA).The vector does not survive in the plants.    8. Glyphosate is one of the new herbicides that is rapidly degraded inthe environment. It has been shown to be less toxic to animals than manyherbicides commonly used.    9. The field test site is small (less than 2 acres) and physically isolatedby a surrounding area of cultivated land.    The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51274,August 31, 1979).   <ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 1st day of June 1989.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
