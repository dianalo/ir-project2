The death toll from the storm's onslaught through the Caribbeanislands and the Yucatan was at least 47, and damage estimatesreached $8 billion. Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga declared aone-month public emergency.   By late evening, a torrential rain was falling in Brownsville.   At 11 p.m. CDT, the storm center was near latitude 22.8 north,longitude 94.4 west, or about 275 miles southeast of Brownsville,moving west-northwest between 12 and 15 mph, with maximum sustainedwinds of 120 mph and accompanied by a 5- to 10-inch rainfall,according to the National Weather Service.   ``If this motion continues, the center of the hurricane willcross the coast near the Texas-Mexico border on Friday evening,''the weather service said. ``If a northwest turn should occur, thelandfall could be further up the Texas coast.''   The weather service issued a hurricane warning for Mexico'snorthern coast and the southern half of the 370-mile Texas coastfrom Brownsville to Port O'Connor, including 250,000-residentCorpus Christi. A hurricane watch remained in effect for theremainder of the Texas coast, from Port O'Connor north to PortArthur near the Louisiana border.   The weather service said warnings might be extended northward,depending on the path of the 450-mile wide storm.   Texas Gov. Bill Clements sent National Guard units to Alice,McAllen and Corpus Christi, the first such deployment for thehurricane, to assist in communications and rescue duties.   Clements also issued an emergency proclamation allowing localauthorities to suspend laws ``to preserve the health, safety andwelfare of the public,'' including such things as the direction oftravel on highways.   Grocery stores ran low on bottled water, batteries, canned tunaand bread as people laid in supplies. Homeowners covered windowsand doors with plywood and shatter-proofing hurricane tape.Offshore oil workers left their rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.   On Galveston Island, City Manager Doug Matthews recommendedThursday evening that the city's 62,000 residents start evacuating.   ``We are dealing with people's lives therefore at 8 o'clock weare recommending evacuation of the island. We feel that we cannotwait until the morning to make that decision,'' Matthews said,adding that roadblocks would be set up at midnight on Interstate 45to limit access to the island.   In Brownsville, Texas' southernmost city, winds began to pick uparound noon under overcast skies. Police said they were askingresidents to consider evacuating, but were not ordering it.   ``We've never evacuated the city and the point is, where are yougoing to move 100,000 people?'' said Sgt. Dean Poos.   A Greyhound-Trailways bus spokesman said the company wasdoubling its schedule of outbound buses to accommodate thosefleeing the storm.   Lorena Curry, who has lived in Brownsville since 1935, said sheplans to ride out the storm. ``I've been through them before. I'mgoing to stick around at my home.'' But she added, ``I could getalong without a hurricane very well.''   Gilbert surged into the gulf after battering the YucatanPeninsula in Mexico with 160 mph winds, forcing tens of thousandsto flee.   After crossing the peninsula, Gilbert's winds weakened to 120mph, but forecasters predicted the storm would intensify again asit moves over open water.   ``The shower and thunderstorm activity that we see taking placearound the hurricane itself is getting better organized, morevigorous, so we think it's starting to strengthen,'' said BobSheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.   Sheets said the hurricane's sustained winds would ``certainlyincrease to 130, 140 miles per hour.''   In the coastal resort of South Padre Island, about 25 milessoutheast of Brownsville, the mayor ordered its 1,000 residents toevacuate.   ``We can't force them to leave, but it doesn't make any sense tostay,'' said Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr., adding that water andelectricity would be turned off Thursday afternoon.   Tropical storm force winds, at least 39 mph, extended outward upto 250 miles to the north and 200 miles to the south of the center.   The storm's first landfall earlier this week left at least 26people dead in Jamaica, five in the Dominican Republic, 10 in Haitiand the six in Mexico. It also left a half-million people homelessin Jamaica and caused widespread damage to the Cayman Islands.   The storm barreled into the Yucatan coast at dawn Wednesday,thrashing beaches with 23-foot waves, uprooting trees, knocking outelectricity and water supplies and severing telephone lines.   In Campeche, the state capital on the peninusula's west coast,boats and seaweed littered the streets of hundreds of yards fromthe shore after Gilbert passed through.   ``The whole city is flooded. Everything is dark,'' said RamonCastillo, a watchman at the newspaper Novedades de Campeche. ``I'velived here all my life and I have never seen bad weather like this.People are scared.''   Mexican officials reported six deaths, including two babies whodrowned, and at least seven people were injured, but authoritieswere unable to reach many isolated villages.   Gilbert pounded the provincial capital of Merida and the gulfport cities of Puerto Progreso, Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen,closing airports and roads and knocking out communications andpower and flooding streets and highways.   About 20,000 people were evacuated from Puerto Progreso andother coastal towns, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry inMexico City said by telephone Thursday. Hundreds of homes weredestroyed, he said.   On Mexico's northern coast, people were evacuated from fishingvillages and towns into shelters in Matamoros, a city of 400,000about 12 miles inland near Brownsville.   The hurricane center said Gilbert at one point was the mostintense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, which wasmeasured Tuesday at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inchesrecorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.   The storm, spawned Saturday southeast of Puerto Rico, appearedto have hit Jamaica the hardest. Seaga said it destroyed about100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes. He estimated damage at $8billion.   Seaga said in a nationwide radio broadcast Thursday that theone-month ``period of public emergency,'' including a dawn-to-duskcurfew to prevent looting, was put into effect ``to enable normalcyto resume in the shortest possible time and to allow the rebuildingprocess to begin.''   On Wednesday, Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm, thestrongest and deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms have maximumsustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophicdamage.   By Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center downgraded itto a Category 4 and to a Category 3 by Thursday morning.</TEXT></DOC>
