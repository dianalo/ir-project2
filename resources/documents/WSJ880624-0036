Sease and David Wilson </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices bowed to profit-taking yesterday, but analysts said the slight decline, coming on the heels of the big rally this week, signals further strength ahead.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 3.91 to 2148.29 in moderate trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 185.8 million shares, down from 217.5 million Wednesday. Declining issues on the Big Board edged out gainers 803 to 708. So far this week the Dow Jones industrials are up 44.27.    &quot;After such a big move this week, the market is giving a tremendously good account of itself,&quot; said Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton. &quot;The summer rally really has begun. How far it goes, we'll just have to wait and see.&quot;    Other analysts agreed that the slight decline was encouraging. &quot;On balance, the performance is reassuring,&quot; said Michael Metz, a portfolio strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co. &quot;The market is rather tenaciously holding its gains. A lot of people missed the move up, and they're looking for an entry point.&quot;    Mr. Metz said there has been a &quot;profound&quot; change in market psychology in the past few days. &quot;For one thing, foreigners finally realized that the dollar is not a risky instrument and they want to increase their exposure to the currency, both in stocks and bonds,&quot; he said. He also suggested that investors world-wide are beginning to sense that the Japanese market is running out of steam. &quot;The trend followers are looking for where the action will be next, and it might be here in the U.S.,&quot; he said.    Overall, Mr. Metz said, the nation's economy seems to be making a smooth transition to an investment and export-dominated economy from one driven by consumption. &quot;How to get from here to there peacefully has been the question, and it appears that we're making a non-disruptive transition,&quot; he said.    Both he and Mr. DaPuzzo predict further gains in stock prices in the near-term. While Mr. DaPuzzo said prices may ease some today -- &quot;you sometimes get some vacuums on Friday afternoons in the summertime&quot; -- he said next week's performance might match this week's.    Trude Latimer, a market strategist at Josephthal andamp; Co., said that much of the strength in stock prices over the last few days stems from the approaching end of the second quarter, when money managers must report to clients on their holdings. Moves to adjust portfolios to win clients' favorable reaction -- commonly known as &quot;window dressing&quot; -- should boost stocks through the rest of June &quot;unless something very unexpected or something quite extraordinary should occur,&quot; she said.    Despite signs of interest in smaller issues, she said, she expects money managers to concentrate on &quot;names they know and they're at home with&quot; as the quarter draws to a close. &quot;This isn't the time for them to go way off the beaten path in the way of new positions.&quot;    International Business Machines, which had advanced nearly six points in the prior two sessions, once again attracted considerable buying interest. The stock surged 2 3/4 to 125 3/4 on Big Board composite volume of 2.9 million shares.    Money-center banks firmed in the wake of Brazil's proposal for a settlement with its bank creditors, which is expected to boost the banks' earnings substantially this year. Citicorp rose 1/8 to 24 1/2, Manufacturers Hanover gained 5/8 to 30 5/8, Chase Manhattan rose 5/8 to 29 5/8, J.P. Morgan rose 5/8 to 38 3/4, and BankAmerica advanced 3/8 to 12 3/4.    GAF fell 1 3/4 to 46 3/8 on New York Stock Exchange composite volume of 1.5 million shares amid concern that a federal investigation into possible securities-law violations could jeopardize its planned leveraged buy-out. The probe involves the company's accumulation of Union Carbide stock. GAF denied any wrongdoing and said the buyout plans &quot;remain unaffected.&quot;    UAL surged 3 7/8 to 94 5/8. Merrill Lynch raised its investment rating on the stock and boosted its estimate of the company's earnings this year to $10 a share from a range of $5.25 to $5.75 a share, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.    Pennzoil climbed 1 3/4 to 77 1/4 amid a rumor that the company is planning a &quot;Dutch auction&quot; tender offer for a large portion of its stock at around $90 a share. Analysts gave the speculation little credence, and one told the investor report that the gain could reflect the belief that the company unit that sells sulfur to fertilizer producers stands to benefit from the continuing Midwest drought.    Rorer Group gained 2 to 36 1/2, with traders citing renewed takeover rumors. Their list of potential acquirers included Ciba-Geigy, Hoffmann-La Roche and Sandoz, all of whom have been named in prior speculation, the investor report said.    B.F. Goodrich rose 3/4 to 55 3/4. The company told Dow Jones News Service it expects earnings for the second quarter and full year to be well above year-earlier levels. Separately, Goodrich completed the sale of its 50% stake in Uniroyal Goodrich Tire for $225 million to Clayton andamp; Dubilier, a New York-based investment firm.    Birmingham Steel, which plans to file for an offering of 3.5 million common shares, fell 1 5/8 to 31 3/8. The number of shares to be offered reflects a coming two-for-one stock split.    The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.23 to 308.82. Volume totaled 12,210,000 shares, down from 15,160,000 yesterday. There were 270 issues advancing, 308 declining and 283 unchanged.    Entertainment Marketing fell 1/8 to 4 1/8 after surging 1 1/4 points yesterday. Chairman Elias Zinn told the investor report that he has discussed selling a stake in the company to at least one foreign group.    BDM International eased 1/4 to 34 3/8 after dropping as low as 31 1/8. There were rumors that Ford Motor might end a $34.75-a-share tender offer for BDM's common stock, set to expire tomorrow night, the investor report said. BDM said Ford plans to proceed with the offer. </TEXT></DOC>
