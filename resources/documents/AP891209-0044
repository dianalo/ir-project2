On Virginiahighways, four people including a 3-year-old boy died in separateaccidents Friday.   Snowfall ranged from 1 inch in Newport News to 9 inches inStaunton. The storm closed schools and sent office workers homeearly around Virginia.   Ronnie Fink of the Virginia Department of Transportation said nohighways were closed, ``but we have many, many miles that aretreacherous.''   The storm left parts of West Virginia covered by up to 6 inchesof snow, and was expected to drop 8 inches on Maryland's EasternShore before it played out today. Washington, D.C., was dusted witha few inches of snow that led the federal government to close someoffices early.   Airline officials reported some delays out of airports inWashington and Baltimore. American Airlines canceled its arrivingand departing flights from the Raleigh-Durham International Airportafter 6 p.m., according to airport spokeswoman Teresa Damiano,although the airport remained open.
