The preoperative anatomic information provided bymagnetic resonance imaging has made operations safer. We have used theultrasonic aspirator to treat 14 intramedullary tumors, including eighttumors that had been judged incurable. Postoperative worsening was recordedin only one patient. Therefore, we believe management of these tumorsshould no longer rely on biopsy followed by radiotherapy, especiallyas radiosensitivity is poor. Radical surgery undoubtedly provides thebest short and medium term results, although follow-up is still too shortto draw definite conclusions concerning the long term prognosis. However,current evidence already shows that surgery should not be postponed untilparaplegia develops, as results are best in early medullary compression.</TEXT></DOC>
