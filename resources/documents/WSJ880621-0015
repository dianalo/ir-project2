A spokeswoman for First Texas Savings Association, which owns 50.9% of Gemcraft's stock, said the Dallas-based thrift was working to replace the Gemcraft board.    Andrew M. Zdobylak resigned as a director and as senior vice president, operations, of Gemcraft, but will remain as president of Gemcraft Homes, the company's homebuilding unit.    Sanford Miot quit last week as Gemcraft's chairman, chief executive officer and president following the resignations of the company's five outside directors. The resignations were prompted by First Texas' refusal to provide $5 million in needed financing unless the board agreed to a voluntary foreclosure of Gemcraft's homebuilding and mortgage units. The capital stock of those units had been pledged as collateral on about $22 million in loans.    First Texas posted the units for foreclosure yesterday. The units will be offered for public sale Friday, but First Texas is expected to make the highest bid.    After the resignation of the board's outside directors, Messrs. Miot and Zdobylak reportedly were concerned about their potential liability as directors if First Texas foreclosed on the units and shareholders sued. Mr. Miot will stay on as chairman and chief executive of the homebuilding unit. Neither of the men could be reached for comment.    In April, First Texas proposed acquiring the 2.4 million shares of Gemcraft it doesn't own for $1.50 a share, or $3.6 million. After the foreclosure, all that will remain with the parent company is its land-development unit, which holds undeveloped land in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio, Texas, with a current book value of about $25 million. The steep slowdown of building activity in those cities makes that value questionable.    First Texas said it intends to proceed with its plan to buy the remaining shares, as long as all conditions, including shareholder approval, are met. </TEXT></DOC>
