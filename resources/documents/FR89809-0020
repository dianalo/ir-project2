The proposal would broaden an exemption from requirementsthat banks maintain certain records and establish certain written policiesand procedures. Under the proposal, the current exemption for banks withan average of less than 200 securities transactions per year would be expandedto 1,000 transactions per year. The purpose of broadening the exemptionfrom 200 transactions per year to 1,000 transactions per year is to reducethe regulatory burden on banks of all sizes that engage in a low numberof securities transactions per year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received by October 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should be directed to: Communications Division,5th Floor, 490 L'Enfant Plaza East, SW., Washington, DC 20219, Attention:Docket No. 89-9.Comments will be available for public inspection and photocopying at thesame location.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>John Kerr, National Bank Examiner,Investment Securities Division, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,Washington, DC 20219, (202) 447-1901.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Under 12 CFR 12.3 and 12.6, every national bank effecting securities transactionsfor customers is required to maintain specified types of records and toestablish specified written policies and procedures. However, andSection;12.7(a) provides a partial exemption from these recordkeeping and writtenpolicy requirements for national banks having an average of less than 200securities transactions per year for customers over the prior three calendaryear period, excluding transactions in U.S. government and federal agencyobligations.Thus, a national bank falling within the current 200 transactions per yearexemption does not have to maintain, among other things, detailed accountrecords for each customer; order tickets for each purchase or sale of securitiesshowing details of the transaction; or a record of all broker/dealers selectedby the bank to effect securities transactions. Additionally, an exemptnational bank does not have to establish written policies and proceduresfor: (1) Assigning responsibility for supervising employees who executesecurities transactions or transmit orders to broker/dealers; (2) assigningthe fair and equitable allocation of securities and prices to accountswhen orders for the same security are received at approximately the sametime; and (3) crossing buy and sell orders on a fair and equitable basis.This does not mean that an exempt national bank can forego maintainingrecords or establishing policies completely. Exempt national banks mustmaintain chronological records of original entry containing an itemizeddaily record of all purchases and sales of securities including the accountor customer name, a description of the security, price, trade date andname of person from whom purchased or to whom sold. Exempt national banksmust establish written policies requiring reporting of certain transactionsto the bank by bank officers and employees who make or participate in thedetermination of investment recommendations or decisions for the accountsof customers. See 12 CFR 12.3(a) and 12.6(d). In addition, the bank mustsend a confirmation as prescribed by andSection; 12.4.The OCC adopted the 200 transaction low activity threshold exception inandSection; 12.7(a) when it initially promulgated 12 CFR Part 12. See 44FR 43252 (1979). Subsequently, the exception was revised to exclude transactionsin U.S. government and federal agency securities from the total numberof securities transactions executed and to exempt banks that do not exceedthe low activity transaction threshold from the written policy and procedurerequirements of andSection;andSection; 12.6(a)-(c). See 44 FR 77137 (1979).Comparable regulations were adopted concurrently by the Federal ReserveBoard in 12 CFR 208.8(k) with a similar 200 transaction per year exemptionin andSection; 208.8(k)(6)(i), and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationin 12 CFR 344 with a similar exemption in andSection; 344.7(a).<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposal</ITAG>To reduce the burden and attendant expense imposed on banks by these recordkeepingand written policy and procedure requirements, OCC is proposing to raisethe current exemption threshold from 200 to 1,000 securities transactionsper calendar year. In effect, a national bank with an average of approximatelyfour transactions per business day would be exempted. Small banks and bankswith small securities brokerage operations are expected to be the principalbeneficiaries of this amendment.Few small national banks exceed 1,000 securities transactions per year.The 1,000 transaction threshold would ease the burden on approximately1,500 national banks with under $1 billion in assets. Banks that have 1,000or more securities transactions per year, usually national banks with $1billion or more in assets, would not be affected by this proposal.OCC requests comment on whether 1,000 transactions is an appropriate thresholdfigure, and whether a 1,000 threshold will afford adequate protection toinvestors who purchase and sell securities through national banks.Some banks with a low volume of securities transactions offer the serviceprimarily as an accommodation to their customers. OCC has received no substantivecomplaints from bank customers using the securities services of banks forwhich the 200 transaction exemption is available.The OCC is not proposing any change in the recordkeeping and written policyrequirements in andSection;andSection; 12.3(a) and 12.6(d) or in the writtenconfirmation requirements in andSection; 12.4. These requirements, describedabove, will remain in effect for all national banks that effect securitiestransactions for customers.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), it is certifiedthat this amendment will not have a substantial economic impact on a significantnumber of small entities. Small entities are the primary beneficiariesof this burden-reducing amendment, but the impact will not be substantial.<ITAG tagnum="84">Excutive Order 12291</ITAG>The OCC has determined that this amendment is not a ``major rule'' andtherefore does not require a Regulatory Impact Analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The collections of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemakinghave been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under controlnumber 1557-0142 for review in accordance with the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h). Comments on the collection of informationshould be sent to the Comptroller of the Currency, Legislative and RegulatoryAnalysis Division, 5th Floor, 490 L'Enfant Plaza East, SW., Washington,DC 20219, with a copy to the Office of Management and Budget, PaperworkReduction Project (1557-0142), Washington, DC 20503.The collections of information in this regulation are set forth in 12 CFR12.3, 12.4 and 12.6, and the exemption is set forth in 12 CFR 12.7(a).This information is needed to ensure national bank compliance with securitieslaws and to protect persons who purchase and sell securities through nationalbanks. The likely respondents are for-profit institutions.Estimated annual reporting burden for 12 CFR Part 12 is 165,001 burdenhours. This proposal, if adopted as a final rule, will reduce the burdenby an estimated 40,721 hours. The OCC estimates that 1,728 banks maintainrecords under 12 CFR Part 12. Small banks and banks with fewer than 1,000transactions will be required to maintain fewer records and therefore arethe primary beneficiaries of this burden reducing change.The average burden will be approximately 72 hours per recordkeeper. Dependingon the degree of activity and whether a bank falls under the proposed 1,000transaction exemption, the actual burden per bank is estimated to rangefrom approximately 4,600 hours annually for a large bank with numeroustransactions to approximately three hours annually for a small bank withfew transactions.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 12</ITAG>National banks, Banking, Securities transactions, Recordkeeping, Confirmation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Issuance</ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Part 12 of Chapter I of Title12 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as setforth below:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 12_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
