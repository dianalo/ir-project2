If weunderstand what George Bush said in his State of the Unionaddress, that should be the eve of Operation Domestic Storm.   &quot;This will not stand,&quot; the President said twice of the&quot;hard times&quot; the nation's economy faces. &quot;I pride myself thatI'm a prudent man, and I believe that patience is a virtue,but I understand that politics is, for some, a game and thatsometimes the game is to stop all progress and then decry thelack of improvement,&quot; he said. He asked the Congress to passhis short-term economic program by March 20. &quot;From the dayafter that, the battle is joined. And you know, whenprinciple is at stake, I relish a good fair fight.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   George Bush, as they discovered in Iraq, likes deadlines.With this deliberate invocation of his Desert Storm rhetoric,he is putting himself on the spot. Unless he wants to go backon another &quot;read my lips,&quot; on March 21 he'll have to dosomething dramatic about the economy and, more to the point,about the Congress. Can he? Will he? When President Bush gaveSaddam Hussein a date certain for getting out of Kuwait, manypeople, including us, wondered whether he'd actually makegood on the threat. Saddam assumed he wouldn't, but onJanuary 16 there were cruise missiles over Baghdad.   The President's economic program, as it happens, is tootimid for our tastes. Even the capital-gains proposal, thebest of the lot, is encumbered with gimmicks on holdingperiods. Robert Barro details other shortcomings alongside.(See related story: &quot;Voodoo Economics&quot; -- WSJ Jan. 30, 1992)But in a certain sense the specifics are not the point. Theeconomy is suffering most of all from a sour public mood, andthe quickest way to break that mood would be for theadministration to break out of the Depublican-Remocratdeadlock and offer the voters a clear choice on economicpolicy.   In any event, there is almost no chance that Congress willpass the President's proposals. The blood of election-yearpolitics will be in the water, whether or not Bill Clintondefeats Gennifer Flowers in the New Hampshire primary. Thevirulent anti-incumbent mood in the land means the Memberswill be looking out for only their own parochial interests,not the common good, which is traditionally a presidentialresponsibility. Besides, the Senate voted down the educationbill the very day Mr. Bush spoke (newspaper photos depicted atriumphant Ted Kennedy). Jack Kemp's HOPE program to empowerpoor people with property, which the President asked for, wastrashed last year. And of course, his capital-gains proposalshave been filibustered and otherwise kept from even coming toa vote.   So the March 20 deadline will pass. Then what?   Then, we hope, George Bush will mount a unilateralcampaign to liberate the American economy, and dare Congressto stop him.   As President, Mr. Bush has direct authority over theexecutive branch, which is to say all the departments,agencies and attendant bureaucrats who most directly affectthe economic life of America's workers and employers. ThePresident has the authority to issue executive orders, as hedemonstrated Tuesday night with his 90-day moratorium on newregulations that &quot;will hurt growth.&quot; When Congress refuses toact, he has the option of asserting his authority, leaving itto voters to approve or disapprove in November.   The President could, for example, unilaterally adoptindexation of capital gains via regulatory fiat. The argumentfor this action, which has been discussed at the White House,was described here Tuesday (&quot;Presidential Indexation&quot;). As wehave also argued, he could also unilaterally assert theline-item veto; his signature messages have in effect alreadyexercised this option against unconstitutional provisions indozens of nonspending bills. Item-veto fans noted thePresident's pointed references to the Lawrence Welk museumand Belgian endive research, not to mention 246 programs that&quot;don't deserve federal funding.&quot;   These assertions of executive authority would becontroversial, and ultimately subject to Supreme Courtreview. But the most important verdict would be that of thevoters. The inability of Washington to control the budget,the political deadlock, the anti-incumbent mood all argue forfinding a vehicle to sharpen the debate, not for endlesswheel-spinning over the terms of a deal. So it's significantthat Mr. Bush strongly hinted going unilateral, &quot;There arecertain things that a President can do without Congress. AndI'm going to do them.&quot;   The State of the Union has been delivered. The NewHampshire primary will be coming February 18. Thepreliminaries are already under way. We're buying box seatsfor March 20. The Deadline.</TEXT></DOC>
