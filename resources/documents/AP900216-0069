(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The second toxic chemical leak in twoweeks at a plant considered among the most modern in the nationforced authorities to order 15,000 residents to remain indoors.   About 500 gallons of muriatic acid leaked from a transfer hoseat Rhone-Poulenc's Institute plant Thursday. No injuries wererported, but fears that poisonous vapor released in the spill wouldspread over Institute and neighboring St. Albans led officials toorder people inside.   ``I'm certainly concerned,'' said plant manager Ron Bearer.``This is a serious incident when we have to recommend to emergencyservices'' that people stay inside buildings.   The vapor didn't leave the plant, and authorities lifted theorder 30 minutes later.   In the first leak, on Feb. 2, a small amount of methylisocyanate, or MIC _ the same chemical that killed 3,500 people in1984 at Bhopal, India _ escaped from a pipe and injured sevenworkers.   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration sentinspectors to the plant after the small MIC leak. They were stillat the plant Thursday, and two more inspectors were dispatched tolook into the muriatic acid leak, said Jack Hord, a spokesman forthe U.S. Labor Department.   After the Bhopal leak and a series of leaks here in 1985, OSHAperformed a wall-to-wall inspection of the plant, which then waswholly owned by Union Carbide. The company was cited with 221violations.   A $1.37 million fine assessed by OSHA was settled out of courtfor $408,500 on the condition Carbide didn't have to admit fault.   The plant, which is about 10 miles west of Charleston and is nowowned by both Union Carbide and Rhone-Poulenc, a French company,was considered by Carbide as the safest in the nation after thecompany spent millions improving safety systems after the 1985leaks.   Hord said the recent incidents don't mean ``this is an unsafeoperation. It doesn't compare to what happened in 1985. Theproblems at Institute in 1985 were just multiplying. You just havetwo incidents here.''   After an August 1985 leak at Institute, 135 sought medical helpat hospitals.   The muriatic acid leaked as workers filled a tank at the plant'swastewater and sewage treatment plant, where the chemical is usedas a neutralizing agent. A truck apparently ran over a hose,causing it to split open, Bearer said.   Muriatic acid is a mixture of hydrochloric acid and water.   A condensed solution of hydrochloric acid causes severe burnsand permanent visual damage may occur, according to The MerckIndex, an encyclopedia of chemicals. If inhaled, it can causecoughing, choking and inflammation and ulceration of therespiratory tract.   The U.S. Coast Guard stopped traffic on the Kanawha River for 30minutes for fear the vapor cloud would sweep toward the river. Thecloud dissipated soon after it formed.   After the Feb. 2 leak, the plant owners were criticized forwaiting three days to notify county emergency officials. Bearerchanged plant policy to require the reporting of all leaks.   Community leaders praised the company for its fast reportingThursday. Kanawha County Manager Ron Gregory said county emergencyofficials received word within 30 seconds of the leak's discovery.   ``I believe the recent MIC incident may very well have had abeneficial effect,'' Gregory said. ``It identified thecommunications problem we had. That's now been corrected.''</TEXT></DOC>
