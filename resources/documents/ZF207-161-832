 While users continue to wait for deliverables, IBM has beenpreparing to translate talk into action on its new Application DevelopmentEnvironment (ADE) approach.andP;  envisioned as a comprehensive collection ofdevelopment and project management tools and user and repository services,ADE is being described by IBM as the long-term answer to users' softwaredevelopment problems.andM;One major part of the answer is the repository, which IBM is expected toannounce soon.andP;  Other more problematic questions remain, however.andP;  For onething, how can users prepare for the evolving environment, and how will IBMprotect their current investments in CASE and other development tools?andP;  Andwhat kind of productivity benefits can users actually anticipate if they buyinto ADE and its SAA prerequisite?andP;  To find out the answers to these andother development concerns, DATAMATION senior editor Linda Runyan and SanFrancisco Bureau Manager Jeff Moad recently interviewed Robert Libutti, IBM'sprogramming systems director of market strategy.andM;Q: What is the primary goal of IBM's Application Development Environment?andM;A: The key objective of ADE is customer productivity.andP;  We want to providecustomers with a set of tools that will allow them to deal with current andbacklogged application.andP;  The second goal, as we move into the future, is togive customers tools to build complex applications that they can manageefficiently.andP;  More and more of these applications will deal with distributedprocessing.andP;  These life cycle tools will enable the IS orgination to beetermanage all the applications spread throughout the enterprise and perhapsthroughout the world.andM;Q: Can this distributed development environment actually exist before suchthings as fully distributed database technology and object-oriented datamanipulation are available?andM;A: Last October we announced distributed DB2 using the SQL standard interfacethat allows a DB2-to-DB2 interconnection.andP;  Over time, that will become moreof an any-to-any relational database within the SAA structure.andP;  I think thistechnology will be available within the next two years.andP;  We've started italready, so we will be reasonably well positioned to support these systems.andM;Q: Will you briefly describe the ADE architecture?andM;A: The ADE work is part of our overall SAA strategy.andP;  It will provide asystem that creates an application development environment on our SAAsystems.andP;  It is an open architecture, so we would provide architecturedocuments and the specifications and interfaces to our customers and to toolvendors.andP;  Under SAA, we will provide for cooperative processing via aprogrammable workstation that is attached to a host, with functions beingshared between the two.andP;  The target workstation will be a PS/2 running underOS/2 Extended.andP;  The PS/2 would work in conjunction with any of the SAAhosts--the AS/400, MVS, or MV systems, or perhaps with a LAN arrangement ofPS/2s.andM;Q: Could you explain the IBM tool model for the ADE architecture?andM;A: The heart of the tool model is the life cycle components that span therequirements, analysis and design, production, building and testing, and theproduction and maintenance phases.andP;  Within each of those phases will be toolsthat address those functions.andP;  Some of the tools will be provided by IBM.andO;Many others will be provided by vendors.andP;  So, on the top of the individualphases will be a set of cross life cycle tools that will assist managers,developers, and users to manage the overall project and to build models oftheir development process that will be stored in a database or in arepository that has associated management facilities.andM;There are different ways you can enter this model.andP;  One way would be to useour current third generation languages and fourth generation languages, suchas Cross System Product (CSP).andP;  Another entry point will be through the useof vendor tools that interface and work on our workstation.andP;  Over time, thesetools will interface to the repository.andM;Q: What are some of the repository services?andM;A: The repository services are integrated, so that as you specifyrequirements and get them defined, the output of that phase can be feddirectly into your analysis and design phase.andP;  After you're through analysisand design, the output would feed directly into, for example, a COBOLcompiler or into a fourth generation language.andP;  The repository allows you todefine a whole set of functions and objects, and to store those objects andtheir relationships to each other.andP;  That way you can start to build up thelogical relationships of your process and your applications.andM;Q: Can you tell us about specific application development tools that IBM willbe offering?andM;A: We have certain tools under development that have not been announced and Idon't want to preannounce them now.andP;  In the life cycle area, we will shortlybe introducing process management mechanisms in the U.S.andP;  We've alreadyintroduced some tools of this type in Europe.andP;  We will continue to providethird and fourth generation languages, and we'll also be intregrating fifthgeneration, knowledge-based systems.andP;  We will continue to build repository,data management, communications, and user access services that support thisenvironment.andP;  And if we feel a tool is appropriate for the marketplace, we'renot precluding ourselves from bringing it out.andM;Q: Many tools such as relational DBMSs and techniques like prototyping havebeen around for quite some time.andP;  Why has it taken IBM so long to define theapplication development environment of the future?andM;A: It is a major undertaking.andP;  The repository, the toolsets, and theinterfaces must be rigorously defined.andP;  We've been testing the repositorydefinition with customers.andP;  We've attempted to test our definitions withexperienced vendors and show them what we're doing.andP;  We've had to make amnychanges to do what customers and vendors say we need to do.andP;  And since we'rebuilding ADE in construct of SAA, it took time to make sure that it wouldwork in all of those system environments.andP;  So the reason it's taken so longis simply to get the requirement right.andP;  And we're now in the phase ofvalidating these requirements with customers and vendors.andM;Q: Do you have beta versions of the ADE architecture?andM;A: Versions of the architecture are being tested.andP;  As a general process, wetry to get groups of customers to review our products before we introducethem.andP;  Some of this review concerns the design and architecture.andP;  On therepository, for example, customers would be looking at the specification ofinterfaces and such things as the command structure.andP;  We also have codeinstalled in customers' offices to give them an opportunity to bring it up ina working environment.andP;  Some of the user services have also been extensivelytested.andM;Q: To operate in the proposed ADE structure, vendors will need interfaceinformation.andP;  Has IBM started sharing any of that information with vendors?andM;A: As I mentioned, we have shared parts of the interface information withcustomers and vendors to validate the design.andP;  So, to that extent, we have.andO;And when we're satisfied with that design, we will open it up to any of thosevendors that are interested.andP;  We will conduct appropriate education so thatthey will have a chance to make their own decisions on how to interface.andM;Q: When do you expect that to happen?andM;A: We'll start that this year.andM;Q: Will you be defining both the interface from the repository manager to thetoolset and from the repository down to the database?andM;A: Our approach has been to try to think of all the things that we need torender explicit to allow people to build into this system.andP;  That's why we'regoing out to vendors and customers to make sure that we defined theappropriate interfaces in the appropriate way to allow that to happen.andP;  Idon't know of any customers or vendors who have said that they've beenprecluded from some opportunity by not having access to interfaceinformation.andM;Q: In defining the interfaces, is IBM planning to commit to OSI or any otherstandard interface?andM;A: Where we can use standard interfaces, we are really trying to do so.andP;  ButI can't tell you specifically whether the one you mentioned is being used ornot.andM;Q: Outside the tool area, what role does IBM see for third-party vendors?andM;A: The role of third-party vendors is very important to us.andP;  It will be anopen architecture.andP;  I don't know of anything that closes any part of theenvironment to our vendors or to our customers.andP;  The repository interfaceswill be well defined.andP;  We'll define a platform for the tools to build to.andM;Q: What is IBM's assessment of CASE?andM;A: The whole set of tools implicit in CASE is a very fundamental part of thestructure that we are putting in place.andP;  But the application developmentenvironment needs to be more than just a set of tools.andP;  Nevertheless, thereare excellent tools around from amany companies that deal with the functionsof defining requirements and doing the design and production of code.andP;  We arebuilding an architecture that will allow those companies to build tools tointerface into our structure if they choose to.andM;Q: Most users have already made major investments in development tools suchas CASE, in languages, and in existing applications.andP;  How does IBM propose toprotect those investments and make it easier for users to migrate to its newenvironment?andM;A: We're tyring to define what we're doing very clearly to customers, andalso to define where it applies to them.andP;  First of all, we're trying to builda level of consistency that users can have confidence in--consistency in thelanguages, in the interfaces, and in the comminications area, for example.andO;Second, we're using components such as DB2 that are used by customers today.andO;And third, we are offering a framework that enables a customer to developwithin an SAA environment.andP;  So, to that extent, we will protect thecustomers' current investments.andM;Q: Many users today are writing to heterogeneous hardware platforms that arenot necessarily SAA.andP;  Do you see ADE extending beyond the SAA environment?andM;A: It's not hard to imagine outputting from certain tools into a commonlanguage like COBOL, for example.andP;  If you had a compatible COBOL, it couldtake that output and generate code for a non-IBM system.andP;  So there are waysof creating the output of the development into an execution environmentthat's non-IBM.andP;  We're not doing that at this time, but it's certainly withinthe realm of feasibility.andM;Q: Are you looking at AIX as one of those target execution environments?andM;A: No.andP;  Not at this point.andM;Q: When will the cross life cycle components, the repository manager, and thedata model all be in place so that users can start planning?andM;A: They need to start planning on the basis of DBi and the SQL database.andO;They also need to start planning on the use of the workstation that will useOS/2 Extended.andP;  CSP will continue to be extensively enhanced.andP;  We expect thatmany vendors will declare their intention to build products using theworkstation.andP;  And as they learn more about it, vendors will also beincorporating their products into the repository.andP;  So I think 1989 will bethe year when customers will be able to start actively planning to move intothis future ADE structure.andM;Q: Is IBM making any attempts to tailor ADE to specific industries?andM;A: I think that is something that we will see evolve, particularly as the IBMoffering gets integrated with vendor offerings.andP;  That will very clearly be anopportunity to customize the system to an industry or to a set of customers.andM;Q: You've described ADE as a &quot;major undertaking.&quot;andP;  What kind of resources isIBM devoting to this exhaustive effort?andM;A: I don't believe that it's a resource issue anymore at IBM.andP;  I don't thinkthis whole area is being constrained in any way.andP;  I think that we have allthe people and all the skills that we need on the problem.andP;  It's an effortinvolving multiple millions of dollars on IBM's part, and eventually it willrequire the same sums of the part of our customers and vendors.andM;Q: You cited productivity as the &quot;key objective&quot; of ADE.andP;  What are IBM'sproductivity targets in terms of the new environment?andM;A: I can't get into that with you.andP;  That information would be in ourlaboratories.andP;  I think we all have to be very careful about quantifyingproductivity.andP;  It's so dependent on the nature of the application and whereyou're coming from.andP;  I think we need to have more experience with ourcustomers and our vendors first.andM;Q: ADE, as you have described it, will be a highly automated environment.andO;Implicit in that automation is a loss of responsibility and control for theIS organization.andP;  What kind of resistance do you expect from the IS manageras a result?andM;A: The IS managers whom I've discussed this subject with are looking forthese tools to help them deal with both ends of the development cycle.andP;  So Idon't agree with the point of view that this kind of technology will somehowdiminish the role of the IS manager.andP;  I'm sure in some shops it could be anissue.andP;  But the IS manager also has to deal with his own people, and many ofthem are young people who are just graduating from college.andP;  They're veryaware of these new technologies and they're bringing those ideas intobusiness.andP;  So while I'm sure there are some people who may feel negatively, Ithink their feelings need to get modified.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
