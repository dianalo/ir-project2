The resignation was expected as Mr. Godwin, who assumed the post about a year ago, was reportedly frustrated in repeated clashes with the military services and Deputy Defense Secretary William Taft IV.    Congress, which created Mr. Godwin's job in 1986, is certain to examine what went wrong during the former Bechtel Group executive's short tenure. &quot;I'm sure we'll be accused of frustrating the intent&quot; of the 1986 legislation, said one department official.    The undersecretary, often referred to as the Pentagon's &quot;acquisition czar,&quot; fought to establish bureaucratic control over the military's $100 billion-a-year weapons-buying activities. But Mr. Godwin was often relegated to an advisory role, with other Pentagon officials unwilling to surrender the authority they had held before his job was created.    Pentagon officials said Mr. Godwin's likely successor is Robert Costello, currently the assistant secretary for acquisition and logistics. Before his Pentagon job, Mr. Costello was executive director for purchasing activities at General Motors Corp.    Mr. Godwin wasn't available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
