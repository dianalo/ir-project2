Baker III said Fridayhe was seeking a waiver from the Bush administration to permit himto participate in decisions on Third World debt even while holdingstock in a major American lender to developing nations.   But Baker stressed that he would accept any of several optionsthat might be chosen by administration lawyers and ethicsspecialists, including possibly selling his stock in Chemical NewYork Corp., a bank holding company.   He denied reports that C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel,had pressed him to sell his holdings.   ``The discussions now revolve around waiver,'' Baker said at anews conference during President Bush's five-hour visit to theCanadian capital.   Bush himself said, ``All I know, there's nobody more ethical thanJim Baker. Complied with the spirit and letter of good ethicspractice. ... I just haven't had a chance to look into it. We'llhave high standards, we know. There will be no conflicts ofinterest.''   Bush commented aboard Air Force One after leaving Ottawa.   Baker, who was White House chief of staff and then treasurysecretary in the Reagan administration, has substantial interests inreal estate, oil and bank stocks, including Chemical New York Corp.,a bank holding company that has $4.5 billion in loans to Third Worldnations, his latest disclosure form shows.   However, the form shows the Chemical holdings were not large atthe time the form was filed last month, between $12,000 and $40,000,   At Treasury over the past several years, Baker put forward a planto deal with the sagging economies of Third World nations burdenedwith debt to commercial banks in the United States and elsewhere. Assecretary of state, he would play a leading role in determining U.S.policy toward the developing nations, especially their debt burden.   ``I have concluded I should seek a waiver,'' Baker said as hecalmly answered a half-dozen questions about the ethics issue raisedin a front-page article in Friday's Washington Post. He said apresidential waiver from normal conflict-of-interest rules ``givesme additional protection and helps avoid the appearance of any sortof conflict.''   Baker, a Texas multimillionaire, said that as White House chiefof staff and then as treasury secretary, ``I've been very carefulabout recusing myself'' from decisions where even an appearance ofimpropriety was possible.   At the same time, Baker said, he recognized that Bush ``made itvery clear that ethics are an important issue to him.''   Baker said the thrust of discussions with administration lawyerswas to find ``mechanisms or actions that could be taken in my caseto insulate me from charges or suggestions of conflict of interest.''   He said that if there were an ethical problem it would have beendiscovered while his nomination was under consideration by theSenate Foreign Relations Committee. During two days of hearings lastmonth, the issue of his finances was never brought up.   Baker said he would be willing to remove himself from policydiscussions of Third World issues, restructure the trust holding hisstock or even sell his stock if that were the conclusion of thecurrent inquiry within the administration.   He said he had not talked to Gray, who is the White House counseland the administration's chief ethics official. However, he saidGray had raised the subject of Baker selling his stock in commentsto Robert Kimmit, a Washington lawyer recently named undersecretaryof state for political affairs.   Earlier, on the flight to Ottawa, presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater said, ``At this point they haven't reached a decision'' ondisposing of any investments. He was referring to ethics lawyersfrom the White House, the State Department and the Office ofGovernment Ethics, which is also part of the executive branch.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman saidthe new review of Baker's holdings was undertaken because of a morestringent interpretation of government ethics rules based on a 1987Justice Department opinion. The Office of Government Ethics,interpreting the Justice Department opinion, requires officials ``tobe more conservative ... than previously believed necessary bygovernment ethics attorneys,'' he said.   From his arrival in the Reagan administration eight years agountil the present, Baker has had his holdings in a ``qualified blindtrust,'' Redman said.   However, the disclosure forms he has filed openly list his assets.   His latest such forms, filed with Office of Government Ethics,list some 5,310 shares of various types of stock held in theChemical New York Corp. _ listed on a form titled ``Assets of adependent child.'' The Bakers have a teen-age daughter, Mary BonnerBaker.   On the form, two types of Chemical stock are listed with valuesranging from $1,000 to $5,000, while two others are listed as beingvalued at $5,000 to $15,000. According to a range provided on thelist, the stocks in total would be worth more than $12,000, but lessthan $40,000.   Baker's Chemical shares originally were in Texas CommerceBancshares, a banking company that grew out of a bank organized byhis grandfather. In May 1987, Texas Commerce was merged with asubsidiary of Chemical, and Baker became a large holder of the NewYork bank company's stock.</TEXT></DOC>
