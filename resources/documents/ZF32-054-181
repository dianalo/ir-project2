(Products).andO;Product:   STB Systems MVP (Graphics board) (evaluation).andO;Topic:     MonitorsResource SharingEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Ordinary VGA boards strike out when you want to plug more than one monitorinto your PC unless you'll settle for the minor-league solution of adding amonochrome-only display that follows the MDA standard.andP;  Put MVP by STB onyour team, however, and your PC will be able to handle four Super VGAdisplays.andP;  You can even add up to four MVPs to one PC for a total of 16monitors.andM;The company explains that MVP stands for Multiple VGA Port Adapter.andP;  And theboard follows this description exactly: It adds multiple independent SuperVGA output ports to your PC.andP;  Each port is connected to the equivalent of acomplete Super VGA adapter; each one has its own Tseng Laboratories ET4000AXVGA chip, 512K or 1MB of 100-nanosecond memory, and a Samsung RAMDAC.andP;  Asingle BIOS serves all four ports.andM;Because four 15-pin high-density D-shell VGA connectors won't fit on a singlecard retaining bracket, the MVP offers mini-DIN plugs and five-inch adaptersto standard VGA cables.andP;  The system side of the interface is a 16-bit ISAedge connector, although on-board jumpers allow you to select 8-bitoperation.andP;  The board fits in any full-length, XT-height expansion slot.andM;STB offers four models of MVP to suit different applications.andP;  Two-portboards with 512K or 1MB of RAM per port retail for $999 and $1,099respectively; four-port boards with 512K or 1MB per port list at $1,799 and$1,999.andM;Each of the two or four on-board ports is completely VGA and VESA compatiblewith the ability to display up to 256 simultaneous on-screen colors from apalette of 262,144 at resolutions up to 1,024 by 768 pixels.andP;  (With 512K ofRAM, only 16 colors are available at highest resolution.) Drivers areincluded for Windows 3.0 and Presentation Manager for operation with two tofour displays at VGA and 800- by 600-pixel resolutions.andM;Either of the driver sets allows you to spread a virtual desktop across up tofour screens arranged vertically, horizontally, or in a two-by-two square,selectable when you install the driver.andP;  Move your mouse beyond the edge ofone screen and it appears at the edge of the adjacent display.andP;  With ordinaryWindows commands, you can move a separate application to each screen orunfurl a really wide spreadsheet.andM;Applications outside the perview of the included drivers will require customprogramming.andP;  All four ports on a board use the standard VGA address range.andO;Each is switched individually on and off using a single on-board register.andO;Switch all four ports on at once and all four monitors connected to the MVPwill display the same image.andP;  Independently enable and disable each port andyou can put separate images on each screen.andP;  Use time slicing to simulatesimultaneous repainting on the four independent screens.andM;While 4 or 16 screens might seem superfluous since most people have only twoeyes and one train of thought, they can be invaluable for debugging (keep theapplication under development on one screen and the code on the other),designing (with the image on one screen and the control menu on the other),business (big spreadsheets can stretch across multiple screens), orinformation displays (by displaying airline flight information on screens indifferent locations).andP;  While the MVP is definitely a specialized player witha limited market, it can be the ideal solution when a single screen justisn't enough.andM;MVP by STBandM;STB Systems Inc., 1651 N.
