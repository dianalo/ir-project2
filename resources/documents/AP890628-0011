Ashkenazy is music director of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,which he will take to Moscow. He said he will conduct two concertsat the Moscow Conservatoire and perform a Mozart concerto in thefirst of them.   ``The Russian people are freer to speak out and expressthemselves ...

But I'm very curious.''   West, speaking in the same measured tones Batman used whilefacing urban menaces, said he would have liked to star in the newmovie.   ``But I would not have been well casted,'' he said. ``They have adifferent vision. People would expect the same thing Batman wasbefore _ lighthearted.''   When the TV show first left the air in 1968, West found himselfhopelessly typecast. He was shot out of cannons at circuses, didavant-garde theater and wrote screenplays. He also did low-budgetfilms, such as as ``The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood.''   The turnaround began when the series became a hit in Londonduring the mid-1980s. Then came the new movie and word that Batman'screator, Bob Kane, is releasing an autobiography.   West has a new movie, ``Doing Time on Planet Earth,'' beingreleased on video and will appear in a London play.   ``But I'm not going to give up my lifestyle,'' said West, ``I'llstill play Bruce Wayne, millionaire philanthropist.''</TEXT></DOC>
