 The applications now include new image featuressuch as support for colour and grey-scale images as well as the high-speedcapture of large volumes of documents.andP;  Enhanced software programs areclaimed to support more efficient workflow management schedules in bothMVS/ESA and AS/400 environments.andP;  IBM also says that System/390 will providehigh-end users of ImagePlus with improved system management, greater levelsof response and faster imaging networks.andP;  The SAA ImagePlus MVS/ESA systemhas two enhanced software programs to enable users to integrate imageprocessing applications into large networks with both local and remote im-ageworkstations.andP;  SAA ImagePlus Folder Application Facility MVS/ESA Version 2organises multiple image documents into electronic folders and into anautomatic workflow management system, indexing and prioritising documentsinto queues for user retrieval.andP;  The optional Folder and Workflow Applicationenables several different imaging applications to run on the same MVS/ESAprocessor.andP;  New folder and document Application Programming Interfaces allowusers to access image functions such as retrieving and viewing, and ImagePlusObject Distribution Manager MVS/ESA Version 2 program now runs on severallocal or remote MVS/ESA processors.andM;ImagePlus/400ImagePlus/400 has an enhanced workfolder software program thatenables users to integrate additional image processing applications into amidsize business or a large department.andP;  Workfolder Application Facility/400Version 2 organises and indexes image documents for storage and retrieval asfolders, cases or individual documents.andP;  New Application Program Interfacesgive users on-line access to scan, index, store, display, retrieve or print adocument, a folder or a specific case without interrupting the currentworking session.andP;  Another new feature is facsimile support that gives usersan automatic means to enter fax documents into an electronic folder or tosend electronic documents from the image sys-tem via fax to another location.andO;Both ImagePlus Folder Application Facility MVS/ESA Version 2 and the enhancedImagePlus Workfolder Application Facility/400 Version 2 software programsoffer batch scanning with optional bar-code recognition.andP;  The ImagePlusWorkstation has been enhanced with three new programs designed to capture,view, print and manipulate image documents on the PS/2.andP;  The new programsinclude the OS/2-based ImagePlus Workstation Program/2 Version 1, ImagePlusWorkstation Program/DOS Version 2.1 and ImagePlus Workstation Program/DOSVersion 2.2.andP;  Licensed programs for ImagePlus Folder Application FacilityMVS/ESA Version 2 are available from December 1990, and cost between $23,270and $164,650.andP;  The optional folder and workflow application is from $11,640to $82,330, and available from June 1991.andP;  ImagePlus Object DistributionManager MVS/ESA Version 2 is from $23,850 and $168,780, and the ImagePlusWorkfolder Application Facility/400 Version 2 is from $15,420 to $42,430.andO;Both are available in December.andP;  ImagePlus Workstation Program/2 Version 1 isout June 1991 at $1,200, MSDOS Version 2.1 is $800 from December, and theMS-DOS Version 2.2 Image Scanner is $6,700, also December.andM;IBM marks out major role in the factory for theandM;AS/400 with CIM Series/400andM;IBM sees the AS/400 becoming a major player in its factory automation plans,and it has announced a new family of products called the CIM Series/400 whichenables the integration of information between and among departments, andconnects various computers and functions.andP;  The company says that it enablesdata to be entered into the system once and then made available to those whoneed it.andP;  The CIM Series/400, said to be suitable for small and medium-sizemanufacturers, will integrate information from the AS/400 to the RS/6000, andthe PS/2.andP;  The three product groups are Base Edition for Services/400 and AIXServices/6000; CAD Integration Edition for AIX Services (garbled text) 6000for CADAM and AIX Services 6000 for CATIA, IBM's two preferred computer-aideddesign software suites; and the Application Edition for Product EngineeringSupport/400.andP;  The Base Edition provides communications and routing servicesthat enable the AS/400 and RS/6000 to share data between applications.andP;  Itincludes a database on the AS/400 to store common data shared by theapplications and an interface to support data sharing with IBM's MAPICS/DBmanufacturing database on the AS/400.andP;  CAD Integration Edition linkscomputer-aided design systems, CADAM or CATIA, on the RS/6000 the AS/400database.andP;  IBM says that with CAD Integration Edition, engineers anddesigners can generate or update drawings faster by accessing informationstored in the AS/400 database, and the computer aided design data isavailable systemwide.andP;  The information is entered only once, and users of theentry-level computer-aided design program for the PS/2, IBM CAD, can exploitthat with a new extension called CAD OS/2 Services for the CIM Series/400.andO;Product Engineering Support/400, PES/400, is an electronic engineeringmanagement system that helps track changes in design and specifications fromproduct inception through production.andP;  IBM says that engineering designchanges can be quickly communicated to production planning systems such asMAPICS/DB, to shorten the design-to-manufacture cycle.andP;  These products enableapplications and data to be integrated within a Token Ring network acrossAIX, OS/400 and OS/2 operating systems.andP;  The CIM Series/400 products arescheduled to be available starting in the third quarter of 1991.andP;  No prices.andM;DisplayWrite 5 Composer page layout is broughtandM;down to micros under MS-DOSandM;In recognition that OS/2 is still a very long way from posing any challengeto MS-DOS, among IBM's printing announcements on Tuesday was DisplayWrite 5Composer, a new page layout program designed to complement the DisplayWrite 5word processor, IBM's one and only reasonably successful MS-DOS application.andO;DisplayWrite 5 Composer, previously available only for OS/2, enables MS-DOSusers to create documents incorporating text, fonts and graphics.andP;  Itincludes 50 pre-defined stylesheets for creating newsletters, reports andproposals.andP;  It requires a personal computer with at least an80286microprocessor and 528Kb of available memory.andP;  DisplayWrite 5 Composer willbe available in the US within a week, and will ship with DisplayWrite 5included for $600, and licensed users of DisplayWrite 5 can add DisplayWriteComposer for $125.andP;  DisplayWrite 3, 4, and 4.2 upgrades cost $200.andM;HEWLETT-PACKARD &quot;PLANS RE-ORGANISATION OF WORKSTATIONandM;DIVISION AFTER POOR PROFITS&quot;andM;First hand accounts out of Fort Collins, Colorado have Hewlett-Packardseverely reducing its main workstation operation there.andP;  No phase of thebusiness will be unscathed, they say, including sales, marketing,manufacturing and research and development.andP;  Further reports indicate thatcertain responsibilities are being transferred to Hewlett-Packard's ApolloDivision, the company's pricey 1989 acquisition, now also hurting and in needof shoring up.andP;  The fact that Hewlett-Packard looks ready to cut itsdedicated workstation sales force, including the Apollo people, by 50%,indicates just how serious things are.andP;  Sales are run independently of eachof the Hewlett-Packard divisions, and are allowed to allocate and redirectresources to where they will have maximum effect.andP;  Poor profitability is thekey to the downsizing and consolidation.andP;  Reportedly, marketing will move toApollo's site in Chelmsford, Massachusetts and manufacturing to its centre inExeter, New Hampshire.andP;  Exactly what will be left in Fort Collins after thecuts are complete is still unclear.andP;  Sources say a third of the 4,000Hewlett-Packard employees in Fort Collins, many of them Hewlett-Packardveterans or people moved specially in the area, could be affected.andO;Embittered reports claim the Apollo sites are being salvaged merely tojustify the Apollo acquisition, which cost Hewlett-Packard nigh on half abillion dollars.andP;  Those at Fort Collins are apparently aware that they areunder the gun, having seen some attrition and what Hewlett-Packard calls&quot;excessing&quot; - notice to find a new job - already in the last few months.andO;However, an executive committee was said to be meeting in Chelmsford lastweek to finalise the cuts, and could be advising Fort Collins more formallysoon.andP;  Hewlett-Packard is also reportedly phasing out the computer-aidedengineering business it acquired several years ago when it bought CericorInc, Salt Lake City, Utah.andP;  Before swallowing Apollo, Cericor wasHewlett-Packard's largest acquisition, bought in 1985 for an undisclosed sumput at &quot;$10m to $50m&quot; high for a company losing money on sales of around $5ma year (CI No 268).andP;  Apparently, the operation, headed by vice-president BillParzybok, will initially be halved to maintain the installed base, thensimply allowed to wither away rather than sold off.andP;  Hewlett-Packard's policyof bundling the electrical computeraided engineering software onHewlett-Packard hardware reportedly did not produce a system that couldcompete with the likes of Mentor Graphics.andP;  Unaffected is the company'smechanical computeraided design unit under Tulman Schad, which however, mightbe moved over to Germany.andP;  Sources fear the cuts will exacerbateHewlett-Packard's growing morale problems, reportedly the reason for a recenttour of all company sites by company founders David Packard and WilliamHewlett.andP;  Insiders say Hewlett-Packard, frequently touted as a paradigm ofAmerican management and famous for its hands-on walk around management style,has lost touch with its employees.andP;  Increasing centralisation at corporateheadquarters in Cupertino, California is blamed, and the company surveysbeginning last year indicate that 25% of the people that work there couldeasily be enticed to go elsewhere, up significantly from the norm of only10%.andP;  Informed of the substance of the story, Hewlett-Packard, afterconsultation at a senior level, said that as nothing had been publiclyannounced, it classed the story as &quot;speculation and rumour&quot;, and would notoffer any comment.andP;
