Energy Department officials testifying before the SenateAppropriations Committe's energy and water development subcommitteeoffered no clues as to what the department will recommend, butvarious members of the committee tried to put their own spin onwhat an advisory panel's report had found.   ``We should not gamble with the nation's security and go with anunproven technology,'' said Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., addingthat the Savannah River complex in his state long had been involvedin producing materials for nuclear weapons.   Hollings facetiously suggested that the ideal solution was tobuild two new production reactors at Savannah River, one in Idahoand convert a mothballed plant at the Hanford nuclear reservationin Washington state.   ``But I question whether we have the money,'' Hollings said.   Hollings took note of the split in the Washington statecongressional delegation over whether to convert the mothballedplant.   ``One senator says we should and another says we shouldn't,''Hollings said.   Washington Republican Sen. Dan Evans supports the conversionproposal and Washington Democratic Sen. Brock Adams opposes it.Neither are members of the appropriations committee.   DOE is scheduled to unveil by the end of the month itsrecommendation on where to locate the new production reactor andwhat technology to use.   Possible sites for the multibillion-dollar reactor, which wouldproduce tritium, include the Savannah River complex near Aiken,S.C., the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls,and the Hanford reservation in southcentral Washington state.   A report from an Energy Department advisory panel, while makingno recommendations, concluded that construction of a newheavy-water reactor at Savannah River offered the ``best chance''of ensuring a steady supply of tritium, a key radioactiveingredient in nuclear weapons.   The report, however, did not completely rule out any of theother options, including converting a mothballed Washington PublicPower Supply System nuclear plant at the Hanford reservation.   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, said he had no objection tobuilding a new production reactor at Savannah River, but urged thatat least one more be built at a different location to avoid putting``all our eggs in one basket.''   McClure said building only one reactor at one site could expose`` our national security unecessarily to events that can bring usto our knees in terms of nuclear deterrence capabilities   ``Whether it's an act of God, a terrorist attack, an unfortuantesafety concern or an unanticipated design flaw, we could findourselves without any production capability if we select only onesite or one technology.''   McClure said his chief concern was national security and if asite other than Idaho was selected it would be ``fine with me.   ``My goal isn't simply to get a reactor built in Idaho.''   Oregon Republican Sen. Mark Hatfield, who opposes conversion ofthe nuclear plant at Hanford, said he thought conversion wouldviolate nuclear non-proliferation laws as it would involve using acivilian reactor for defense purposes.   ``I'm deeply concerned about the implications,'' Hatfield said.   The nation's three existing defense production reactors, locatedat Savannah River, have been operating at less than 50 percent offull power because of safety concerns.</TEXT></DOC>
