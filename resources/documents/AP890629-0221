Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of``eco-refugees,'' threatening political chaos, said Noel Brown,director of the New York office of the U.N. Environment Program, orUNEP.   He said governments have a 10-year window of opportunity to solvethe greenhouse effect before it goes beyond human control.   As the warming melts polar icecaps, ocean levels will rise by upto three feet, enough to cover the Maldives and other flat islandnations, Brown told The Associated Press in an interview onWednesday.   Coastal regions will be inundated; one-sixth of Bangladesh couldbe flooded, displacing a fourth of its 90 million people. A fifth ofEgypt's arable land in the Nile Delta would be flooded, cutting offits food supply, according to a joint UNEP and U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency study.   ``Ecological refugees will become a major concern, and what'sworse is you may find that people can move to drier ground, but thesoils and the natural resources may not support life. Africa doesn'thave to worry about land, but would you want to live in theSahara?'' he said.   UNEP estimates it would cost the United States at least $100billion to protect its east coast alone.   Shifting climate patterns would bring back 1930s Dust Bowlconditions to Canadian and U.S. wheatlands, while the Soviet Unioncould reap bumper crops if it adapts its agriculture in time,according to a study by UNEP and the International Institute forApplied Systems Analysis.   Excess carbon dioxide is pouring into the atmosphere because ofhumanity's use of fossil fuels and burning of rain forests, thestudy says. The atmosphere is retaining more heat than it radiates,much like a greenhouse.   The most conservative scientific estimate that the Earth'stemperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years, saidBrown.   The difference may seem slight, he said, but the planet is only 9degrees warmer now than during the 8,000-year Ice Age that ended10,000 years ago.   Brown said if the warming trend continues, ``the question is willwe be able to reverse the process in time? We say that within thenext 10 years, given the present loads that the atmosphere has tobear, we have an opportunity to start the stabilizing process.''   He said even the most conservative scientists ``already tell usthere's nothing we can do now to stop a ... change'' of about 3degrees.   ``Anything beyond that, and we have to start thinking about thesignificant rise of the sea levels ... we can expect more ferociousstorms, hurricanes, wind shear, dust erosion.''   He said there is time to act, but there is no time to waste.   UNEP is working toward forming a scientific plan of action by theend of 1990, and the adoption of a global climate treaty by 1992. InMay, delegates from 103 nations met in Nairobi, Kenya _ where UNEPis based _ and decided to open negotiations on the treaty next year.   Nations will be asked to reduce the use of fossil fuels, cut theemission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases such asmethane and fluorocarbons, and preserve the rain forests.   ``We have no clear idea about the ecological minimum of greenspace that the planet needs to function effectively. What we do knowis that we are destroying the tropical rain forest at the rate of 50acres a minute, about one football field per second,'' said Brown.   Each acre of rain forest can store 100 tons of carbon dioxide andreprocess it into oxygen.   Brown suggested that compensating Brazil, Indonesia and Kenya forpreserving rain forests may be necessary.   The European Community istalking about a half-cent levy on eachkilowatt-hour of fossil fuels to raise $55 million a year to protectthe rain forests, and other direct subsidies may be possible, hesaid.   The treaty could also call for improved energy efficiency,increasing conservation, and for developed nations to transfertechnology to Third World nations to help them save energy and cutgreenhouse gas emissions, said Brown.</TEXT></DOC>
