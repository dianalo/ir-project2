<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-18-0925 </DOCNO><TEXT>The issue of sphaleron-induced baryon decay and various paradoxes relatedto the instanton method of computation are addressed. By various exampleswe argue that there is no contradiction between the instanton estimatesand sphaleron estimates, and argue that for electroweak theory theseestimates correspond to different approximations for distinct phenomena.We also investigate numerically the nature of the classical decay ofa sphaleron in the (1+1)-dimensional Abelian Higgs model.</TEXT></DOC>
