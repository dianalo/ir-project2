Trouble is, theyare the opportunities.   Law-enforcement officials and others say fraudulentbusiness offers are on the rise, and more Americans arefalling prey. The recession makes potential victims eager tobuy into a business venture that promises sure-fire income,officials add.   The result is often devastating. While many scams cost thebusiness owner a few hundred dollars and make him feelfoolish, business-venture schemes cost the victim a wholebusiness. Moreover, such schemes are often the hardest typeto fight because their promoters at least go through themotions of helping establish a neophyte in a business, suchas a string of pay telephones or vending machines.   Jody Collins, a Florida assistant attorney general, saysquestionable business offers are &quot;the big new scam,&quot; andlikens them to &quot;an amoeba dividing and spreading across thecountry.&quot; She says Florida authorities have received over 100complaints about alleged phone and vending-machine fraudsalone in the past 10 months vs. almost none in the prioryear. Herschel Elkins, a senior assistant attorney generalfor California, says business-opportunity frauds are&quot;flourishing.&quot;   Nancy Castle and Louise Vaughn are typical ofentrepreneurs who say they have been fleeced. They say theypaid about $70,000 to Communication Systems of America ofPompano Beach, Fla., for 26 pay phones and have gotten littlebut grief in return.   Since the breakup of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.,other companies and individuals have been able to buy paytelephones, lease locations for them and connect theequipment to the local phone company and a long-distancecarrier. Some companies sell equipment to smaller operatorsand help them find locations.   A suit filed by Ms. Castle in a Redwood City, Calif.,state court charges Communication Systems with breach ofcontract and &quot;intentional misrepresentation.&quot; (Ms. Vaughnsays she didn't sue because &quot;only lawyers win&quot; inlitigation.)   The suit contends that Communication Systems &quot;guaranteed&quot;each phone would produce revenue of at least $200 a month andpromised to help find lucrative locations. But, the suitasserts, only one phone was placed, for lack of availablelocations. It also claims the equipment arrived late and &quot;inpoor condition.&quot;   Communication Systems hasn't filed a response to the suit,according to the state court clerk's office, and companyofficials couldn't be reached.   Meanwhile, Florida has filed suit in a Broward Countystate court against Communication Systems, its president,Brad Sirkin, and an allegedly related vending machinecompany. It charges that the defendants overestimated theincome to be made and in some cases took people's moneywithout delivering the phones or the vending machines, whichdispense fruit juice. The phones cost an average of $4,000each and the vending machines $3,000 each, the suit says.   Robert Forman, an attorney for the defendants in theFlorida state suit, says his clients deny any wrongdoing.However, he says he doesn't know Mr. Sirkin's whereabouts andhasn't talked to him for some time. Communication Systems isout of business, says Mr. Forman. Its telephone has beendisconnected.   Other companies also attract complaints. Philip Halverson,a Los Angeles attorney representing Ms. Castle, says he isinvolved in five suits around the country against privatepay-phone companies. Some of those other companies &quot;sold thesame location three or four times to different people,&quot; hesays.   Of course, many pay phone ventures are completelylegitimate. But Robert Aldrich, an attorney for the AmericanPublic Communications Council, a trade group of independentpay-phone operators, says complaints about suspected scamshave started coming in from around the country over the pastsix months.   A spokeswoman for the California Pay-phone Associationsays her trade group has been receiving as many as fivecomplaints a day about alleged scams over the past severalmonths compared with practically none previously.   Some pay-phone companies are telling prospects that &quot;theywill only have to spend 10 minutes a week picking up coinsfrom their phone,&quot; says the spokeswoman. The reality, shesays, is that successful pay phones require a lot ofoversight and knowledge by the owner. Some pay-phone sellers&quot;claim it is a get-rich-quick (business) and it isn't,&quot; sheadds.   Neither is the Pop N' Nut vending machine, according to asuit filed by about 60 plaintiffs in a Palm Beach, Fla.,state court. That suit charges several individuals andcompanies with fraud and misrepresentation. Jeffrey Liggio,the plaintiffs' attorney, says his clients spent over $1million buying the machines, which supposedly can pop popcornor roast peanuts on the spot. The defendants have all deniedthe charges and are seeking to have the suit dismissed.   According to the suit, the plaintiffs often traveled tothe Pop N' Nut factory in Boca Raton, Fla., at the companies'behest, each carrying a $5,000 cashier's check as a deposit.Machines cost about $5,000 each and a minimum of three had tobe bought, the suit says. The machines purchased by theplaintiffs didn't work, the suit contends.   &quot;This has been a nightmare beyond belief,&quot; says Robert S.Lawrence of Minneapolis, one plaintiff. He says that he and apartner spent over $50,000 on 15 Pop N' Nut machines. Mr.Lawrence says he had hoped to turn the machines into afull-time business to replace his work as a housingdeveloper, which has been badly hurt by the recession.   Instead, Mr. Lawrence says, he and his partner have 15machines gathering dust in a garage. &quot;In the six weeks we hadthem in the field, we didn't make enough money to cover ourgas, considering all the service calls,&quot; says Mr. Lawrence.   An attorney for several of the defendants in the casedeclines to comment on specific charges, but says his clientsdid nothing wrong. An attorney for another of the defendantssays the matter is simply a business dispute that didn'tinvolve any fraud.</TEXT></DOC>
