San Francisco-based Chevron's profit fell to $384 million,or $1.09 a share, pressured by weak performance in itsmarketing and refining operations.</LP><TEXT>   A year earlier, the company reported net income of $648million, or $1.83 a share. Revenue rose to $9.7 billion from$8.9 billion a year ago, driven mostly by higher prices andsales volume of crude oil.   For Houston-based Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/ShellGroup, the second-quarter loss includes a $90 million chargefor recently announced work force reductions of as many as15% of the company's employees. In the 1990 second quarter,Shell earned $161 million. Revenue rose 3.3% to $5.35 billionfrom $5.17 billion.   &quot;We are proceeding with the streamlining of ouroperations,&quot; said Frank Richardson, chief executive officerof Shell. He also said that in addition to the previouslyannounced plan to try to sell its Los Angeles-area refinery,Shell was also trying to sell oil and gas properties.   Chevron said the quarterly results included gains of $120million from special items. These special items included a$62 million gain on asset sales and $81 million in prior-yeartax benefits, offset by a $23 million charge forenvironmental provisions. The prior-year quarter included $58million in special gains.   Kenneth Derr, Chevron chairman and chief executiveofficer, said competition in major gasoline markets andunexpected refinery problems sharply eroded product salesmargins. Earnings also suffered from lower natural gasprices, as well as reduced demand and prices in the chemicalsindustry caused by the weak economy.   Domestic refining and marketing operations showed a $16million loss for the quarter, compared with earnings of $370million a year earlier. International petroleum operationsearnings rose to $279 million from $167 million, whilechemical operations earned $36 million, down sharply from $65million a year ago. Domestic exploration and productionearnings slipped to $70 million from $91 million in theyear-ago quarter.   For the six months, Chevron net income dropped 16% to $941million, or $2.68 a share, from $1.12 billion, or $3.16 ashare, a year ago. Revenue was $20.5 billion, up from $18.3billion.   Shell said the biggest factor in its weak operatingresults was also a &quot;significant drop&quot; in refining andmarketing. Earnings fell to $5 million from $73 million.Chemical profit fell to $58 million from $90 million. Oilexploration and production profit was $10 million comparedwith a loss of $22 million.</TEXT></DOC>
