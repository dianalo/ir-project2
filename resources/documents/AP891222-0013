Alan Cranston announced Thursdayhe has called off his plans to marry a 49-year-old woman onChristmas Eve, a spokesman for his office said.   The Democratic senator, under intense scrutiny for his role inthe Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan scandal, said through a spokespersonthat the wedding would be unfair to his fiancee, Cathy Lee Pattizof Beverly Hills.   ``When the press pounced upon us before we filled out themarriage license forms, it became clear to me that this is not anappropriate time to start a marriage and it would not be fair toCathy to bring her into the middle of a stressful situation, so wewill not be married on Dec. 24,'' Cranston said in a preparedstatement.   Cranston, 75, surprised associates recently by announcing hewould marry Pattiz at his sister's home in Los Altos Hills. Themarriage would have been the third for Cranston, whose lastmarriage ended in divorce in May, and the first for Pattiz, anIllinois native who has known Cranton since 1968.   No other details of the decision were immediatley available.   The couple appeared smiling Tuesday when they posed forphotographs while taking out a marriage license in Palo Alto.   Cranston is one of five U.S. senators under fire for acceptinglarge contributions from Charles Keating Jr., the conservativeArizona financier who ran Lincoln. In 1987, the five interceded onbehalf of Keating with a federal regulator involved in probingLincoln, which declared bankruptcy last April.</TEXT></DOC>
