They are operating lease companies -- the merchant bankers of aviation -- whose role in financing aircraft sales is helping cash-strapped airlines respond more quickly to market changes. Leasing companies purchase planes and lease them on a short-term basis, allowing carriers to operate planes on flexible schedules without taking on debt.    Such leasing firms relieve airlines of both the risk and the benefits of aircraft ownership -- and the service is very pricey and very popular. Leasing companies have purchased about 50% of the commercial jets ordered so far this year, including this week's record-setting $6.6 billion in orders from International Lease Finance Corp. of Beverly Hills, Calif.    Unheard of 20 years ago, short-term lessors such as International Lease are the fastest growing segment of the leasing business. The trend is expected to accelerate as airlines replace older models to satisfy safety concerns and comply with noise-abatement laws.    Although they pay a premium to lease on a short-term basis, newly privatized international carriers such as Lufthansa, British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Malaysian Airlines have nonetheless at times viewed such transactions as more attractive than issuing public debt or arranging bank financing to purchase planes outright. Small airlines, such as Seattle-based Alaska Airlines Group, have been the leasing companies' other principal customers. America West Airlines, based in Phoenix, Ariz., says its launch in 1983 wouldn't have been possible if it had had to purchase outright its $70 million of aircraft.    The lessor, closely held GPA Group Ltd., based in Shannon, Ireland, has since become the world's dominant leasing concern, managing a current world-wide portfolio of $1.7 billion of aircraft and earning an estimated $100 million for the fiscal year ended March 31.    &quot;We're market makers,&quot; says Morris Foley, GPA's president. &quot;There's a discernible gap between the manufacturers' long planning horizons and those of airlines, which are getting shorter as they change routes and add aircraft.&quot;    GPA and others certainly fill that gap, even if it takes a world-wide round-robin deal to do it. A British charter carrier recently wanted to replace its GPA-owned Boeing 737-200 twin-jets with new 737-300s, which have a larger seating capacity. So the leasing concern placed the British line's 737-200 model planes with a Canadian carrier, shipped off the Canadian airline's planes to Brazil, and placed the Brazilian carrier's planes in Mexico.    GPA has to follow its fleets -- which typically turn over every five to seven years -- around the world from one operator to the next. Its computerized trading floor is complete with 10-foot screens capable of displaying details such as the rental hours and engine maintenance of any of the world's airlines at the touch of a button.    But GPA faces a burgeoning list of competitors, including International Lease, a publicly traded company that manages fewer than half as many planes as GPA's current 113 but is growing fast, mainly through offshore leases.    International Lease actually pioneered the operating-lease industry in 1972 by doing business with start-up carriers that didn't have the track records or debt ratings necessary to finance planes through traditional 20-year leases.    Since the 1986 tax bill eliminated incentives to own aircraft -- such as the investment tax credit and accelerated depreciation -- International Lease has increasingly done business with U.S. airlines. &quot;The airlines' balance sheets can no longer hold all the growth in their fleets,&quot; says Steven Udvar-Hazy, International Lease's president.    The orders International Lease placed earlier this week with Seattle-based Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, will increase its fleet by about 170 planes through 1995, in addition to the 12 planes it plans to add by the end of this year.    Newer entrants include Japanese financial institutions such as Sumitomo Trust Bank, a unit of which has formed a joint venture with Ernest H. Boullioun, a former president of commercial aircraft at Boeing. The Seattle-based venture is expected to have as much as $2 billion in financing at its disposal that will be raised through syndicates in Japan.    The big aircraft makers themselves have taken the risks of granting short-term operating leases, notably with American Airlines' $2.5-billion acquisition of 25 Airbus A300s and 15 Boeing 767s in March 1987. American called its twin leases &quot;walkaway&quot; and &quot;rent-a-plane&quot; deals, and industry analysts predicted that other airlines would demand similar concessions from the manufacturers. But Richard R. Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice president, recently told reporters: &quot;It doesn't look like we would do that sort of thing again.&quot; Meanwhile, St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. has formed a joint venture with GPA, known as Irish Aerospace, to facilitate leasing of its new MD-11 jumbo jet.    McDonnell, the smallest of the three aircraft makers, views the operating-lease trend as one way to keep up with its more powerful competitors. &quot;We are probably the most aggressive lessors,&quot; says Anders Folkedal, director of aircraft services and trading of McDonnell. With pressure increasing from federal regulators to retire aging aircraft, the company sees its future role growing.    Traditional &quot;financial&quot; leases, in which airlines sell 80% of the ownership of a plane to financial institutions, remain the most economical way to buy aircraft. Monthly payments for a 20-year lease are at least 50% lower than those on a five-year operating lease, industry executives say. &quot;It's like going out and buying a house,&quot; says one executive: A 30-year monthly mortgage payment is lower than a 10-year mortgage payment.    Since much of the demand is from undercapitalized concerns, the smallest companies end up paying the highest rates. After Alaska Air Group acquired Jet America, a small West Coast carrier, its officials negotiated a 20% reduction in monthly lease rates on the MD-80s the smaller airline had been operating. &quot;We told the lessors we had to have some concessions, and they recognized that (otherwise) they would have had to take the airplanes back and find another home for them,&quot; says J. Ray Vingo, chief financial officer of Alaska Air Group.    But operating-lease prices are rising, spurred by increased demand.    &quot;We signed an operating lease for an aircraft a year ago and just signed a lease for two more of the same aircraft this year. The lease rate went up 14%,&quot; says Mr. Vingo. &quot;The market has gotten a lot tighter for these newer aircraft, and there's a scarcity premium built into the price.&quot; Because of rising prices, Alaska Airlines, which once relied almost exclusively on operating leases, now mixes long-term and short-term contracts.    The rising prices are keeping certain would-be leasing advocates, including John C. Pope, chief financial officer of Allegis Corp.'s United Airlines, out of the market. Although he designed the Boeing and Airbus leases while he was chief financial officer at American Airlines last year, Mr. Pope now says &quot;the cost is too much vis a vis the flexibility. It's easy to get leases, but you pay a lot of money for them.&quot;    But Mr. Hazy of International Lease insists that tax-law changes, which have driven up the rates of long-term financial leases, have actually made his style of leasing more attractive.    &quot;The disparity between long-term and short-term lease rates has narrowed,&quot; he says. &quot;So an airline looking to us for flexibility pays a very small premium.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
