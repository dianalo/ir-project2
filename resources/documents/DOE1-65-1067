It includes a brief review ofsolar energy resources. Research activities in the development of passive,active, and photovoltaic systems are described. An economic evaluationof the various techniques, based on the Canadian situation, is also presented.Of the three types of solar energy systems considered, it is concludedthat passive systems, in the larger sense of systems based on the useof high-yield solar collectors and on the efficacious management of energyuse in buildings, allow the best response to short and long term Canadianenergy demand. 31 refs., 26 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
