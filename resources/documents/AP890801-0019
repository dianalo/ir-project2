(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The yellow ribbons around the trees thatshade William Richard Higgins' first school are tattered and fadingafter 17 months, much like local hopes that he would survive hiscaptivity in Lebanon.   Two blocks north of Lancaster Elementary School, the red brickhouse that was his first home stands vacant and decaying, apoignant reminder of reports that Higgins' captors had hanged theMarine lieutenant colonel.   ``It's a sad day _ sad for everybody in the country and a sadday for Lancaster,'' said Doris Spurlin, who like other merchantshere had decked the door of her dress shop with a yellow ribbon.   ``Everybody had been so hopeful that he would get out,'' shesaid Monday.   Higgins, 44, was seized while assigned to a United Nationspeacekeeping force. Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems claimed Monday tohave executed him in retaliation for Israel's kidnapping of aMoslem cleric. The group released a videotape purporting to showthe execution.   Higgins' wife, Robin, said in a statement released in Washingtonby her attorney, Gregory Craig, that she did not know if thereports were true.   ``One thing I have learned over the past 17 months is that thetruth is hard to find, and it remains so,'' said Mrs. Higgins, 37,who is a major inthe Marine Corps and works at the Pentagon as apublic information officer.   Mrs. Higgins did not come to work Monday, but arrived at thebuilding at midmorning with Higgins' 19-year-old daughter, Chrissy.They remained secluded, out of reporters' sight.   In her statement, Mrs. Higgins urged Americans not to draw anypremature conclusions ``during this terrible time of uncertainty.''She also appealed to the captors in Lebanon to ``put an end to thisneedless cycle of violence and victimization by releasing myhusband right now and sending him home.''   Peggy Say, the sister of hostage Terry Anderson, urged Americanofficials to respond cautiously to Higgins' reported death.Anderson, the longest-held hostage, is Middle East correspondentfor The Associated Press.   ``What we have witnessed, in the Israeli retaliation in kind forthe kidnapping of their people, (is) that violence truly does begetviolence and that I hope the United States will use thisopportunity for reconciliation rather than retaliation,'' Mrs. Saysaid in an interview from her home near Cadiz in western Kentucky.   ``An eye for an eye only leaves both sides blind.''   Higgins' sister, Mary Fisher, said from her home in theLouisville suburb of Okolona that she believed Higgins' was deadbefore she saw the videotape.   ``How can I doubt it,'' said Mrs. Fisher, adding that she wasangry because ``the government has not done what it should havedone to get him out.''   U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who attended church in southLouisville with Higgins in the 1950s, recommended he be given thenation's highest honor, the Medal of Honor.   ``Regardless of Higgins' fate, he deserves it,'' the KentuckyRepublican said.   McConnell's Democratic counterpart, Wendell Ford, called uponPresident Bush to ``take immediate retaliatory action.''   ``Just issuing a statement of protest isn't going to cut it,''Ford said. ``We've had Americans now in captivity for years, andthis heinous act should motivate us to make an extra effort to getour remaining hostages released.''   Bush Monday night called on ``all parties'' holding hostages inthe Middle East to release them ``to begin to reverse the cycle ofviolence.''   In Texas, meanwhile, two men who were Marine academy classmatesof Higgins started a scholarship fund for his daughter. ``Short ofgetting on our old gear and going to find the guys that hung him,we decided to do something for his kids,'' said G.S. ``Sky'' Page,who chipped in $250 along with Greg Mullen.   Lancaster, a farming town of 3,400, claims Higgins as a nativeson although he was born a county away in Danville, which had thenearest hospital, and grew up mainly in Louisville.   Higgins lived here only through the first grade, but both linesof his family _ the Higginses and the Eagles _ werewell-established, said Marguerite Whittaker, co-owner and managingeditor of Lancaster's 100-year-old weekly newspaper, The CentralRecord.   Although few townspeople knew Higgins personally, ``they havebeen concerned,'' Mrs. Whittaker said.   Higgins' family called him Richard, perhaps to avoid confusionwith his father, Billy Higgins, an accountant.   Billy Higgins died in Louisville and was brought here for burialin the Lancaster Cemetery beside his wife, Ethel Eagle Higgins, onFeb. 20, 1988 _ three days after his son's abduction.</TEXT></DOC>
