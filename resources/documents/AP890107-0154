He was 87.   Crown Prince Akihito, oldest of the emperor's two sons, becamethe 125th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne. In a solemn,wordless four-minute ceremony, a sword, jewels and the imperialseals were placed on a table in front of him, and he bowed.   Hirohito died without ever having shed much light on his WorldWar II role.   Historians generally agree he was a figurehead who was requiredto approve decisions of the military leaders, until he decided theJapanese had suffered enough _ atomic bombing, firebombing andinvasion _ and personally announced surrender in August 1945.   His death followed a 3{-month illness during which reports on hisblood pressure and temperature became fixtures of Japanese routineand many festivities were postponed or canceled.</TEXT><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Japan's new imperial era was formally named``Heisei'' _ or Achieving Peace _ to set a new tone for EmperorAkihito's reign after the turbulence of his father's 62-year epoch,the government announced today.   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi announced the new name,which will be used on calendars and official documents.   Under a 1979 law, and a custom dating back 1,300 years, a newname is assigned when a new emperor ascends Japan's 2,600-year-oldChrysanthemum Throne.   Emperor Hirohito died today of intestinal cancer after a 3{-monthillness. He was 87.   His oldest son, Akihito, 55, immediately succeeded him.   ``Heisei'' was chosen for Akihito's reign because the word,consisting of two Chinese characters, ``includes the meaning ofachieving peace domestically, internationally and in heaven,'' PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita said in a statement.</TEXT><DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Libyan government, challenging U.S.justifications for the downing of two Libyan jets, claims its planeswere overwhelmed by 14 ``hostile American aircraft.''   A government spokesman said the U.S. assertion that two Americanjets had acted in self-defense after being dogged in the air by theLibyan MiG-23s was ``a fabrication.''   The Libyan account _ echoed on national television and by theofficial news agency JANA _ appeared intended to counter the U.S.government's vigorous presentation of its own case.   Washington has provided television stations with videotape saidto be from Wednesday's attack, as taken by one of U.S. aircraft, andhas shown blurred photographs to the U.N. Security Council of whatit said was a Libyan plane carrying four bombs that was downed inthe encounter.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President-elect Bush says he will go before ajoint session of Congress soon after his Jan. 20 inauguration tospell out his idea of a ``flexible freeze'' on spending to bringdown the federal budget deficit.
