French employers,meanwhile, say they're having more trouble finding enoughpeople to hire than at any time since 1979. West Germanemployers, despite an unemployment rate of about 6%, higherthan that in the U.S., have absorbed hundreds of thousands ofEast German refugees this year, and still say they're shortof skilled help.   After nearly a decade of steady economic growth,unemployment continues to fall throughout the industrializedworld, but still remains historically high in spots. Evenmassive programs aimed at removing barriers to job creation,such as the European Community's 1992 program, either haven'tworked yet or haven't worked well enough.</LP><TEXT>   Nonetheless, with some economies, such as those of Germanyand France, now working at or near their total productioncapacity, worries have developed that job shortages may soonlead to higher wage settlements. Those wages could in turnfuel higher inflation that could eventually choke off theeconomic recovery.   Paradoxes like these have led the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development to shift the emphasis ofits advice to its 24 industrialized members on how to cutunemployment. The OECD for the past decade has urged policiesthat stimulated macro-economic growth, coupled with theremoval of regulations or other internal impediments tocreating jobs, all softened by generous unemployment benefitsto tide people over until the jobs were created.   Now, though, after six years in a row in which highereconomic growth has cut unemployment rates nearly everywherein the OECD, the government-sponsored research body issuggesting that governments worry more about ensuring acontinuing supply of future workers.   Governments currently spend about 2% of their grossnational products on job programs, the OECD says, withtwo-thirds of the money going to benefit payments, andone-third to training. The OECD's annual Employment Outlooksuggests that governments would do better shifting directpayments to programs to train workers or expand the workforce. More women should be tempted back into the workplaceby offering better child care. Unemployment payments shouldbe increasingly tied to training programs. The efficiency ofpublic and private job-search and job-matching agenciesshould be increased.   &quot;The demographic trends show clearly that there will befewer young people coming along at the same time thattechnological advances are demanding different kinds ofskills and different kinds of work arrangements,&quot; says TomAlexander, head of the OECD's Directorate for Social Affairs,Manpower and Education. Meanwhile, the economic boom isdrawing more and more migrants, from North Africa, EasternEurope and Latin America, into the OECD. These migrants oftentake low-skilled, low-paid jobs that have previously gonebegging, even in European countries with high unemploymentrates.   Both anecdotal and statistical evidence suggests that,particularly in Europe, the people who've been out of workthe longest either don't have the skills employers arelooking for; or won't trade unemployment benefits forlow-paying manual jobs; or won't move to where the jobs are,even within their own countries. This lack of labor mobility-- mobility that is one of the great strengths of the U.S. --isn't expected to improve much in Europe even after the 1992program removes most barriers to the movement of peopleacross European borders.   Meanwhile, necessary jobs are being filled from outside,even as national unemployment rolls remain long. Paris'sstreet cleaners are nearly all immigrants. West Germany'svast, usually family-owned machine tool industry desperatelyseeks tool-and-die makers, thin on the ground in Duesseldorf,but plentiful in Dresden and elsewhere in East Germany. Thelong-term unemployed in Europe don't all have to becomestreet sweepers, but thousands could be retrained astechnical workers. Unemployed Germans can't all set dies, butthey could be drawn back into the work force throughsubsidized on-the-job training programs, the OECD says.   The trend toward some sort of &quot;workfare&quot; is increasinglywell-established in Europe. Sweden has long tied unemploymentbenefits to training programs, France last year introduced asort of minimum wage for the down and out, requiringrecipients to participate in counseling or training toreabsorb them into the work force. The Dutch have transferredmuch of their benefits program from a government agency to atripartite body involving employers and unions as well.   The OECD's report projects a virtually stable unemploymentpicture for this year and next, after a sizable fall in 1989.U.S. unemployment is expected to rise to 5.4% in 1991, from5.3% this year. West German unemployment is projected to riseto 6.1% this year from 5.5% last year, reflecting theabsorption of East Germany, but then to begin falling in1991.   However, OECD officials added that their officialprojections on German unemployment may be overly pessimistic.&quot;There's really no sign yet of increasing unemployment inWest Germany,&quot; says Mr. Alexander. As for fears in manyWestern European countries that jobs will flee to the East insearch of lower-paid workers and lower government socialcharges, so far there isn't any evidence of that, either.   Western European labor leaders want to make sure it neverhappens. &quot;Some employers look on Eastern Europe as aninviting pool of cheap labor,&quot; says Gavin Laird, generalsecretary of Britain's Amalgamated Engineering Union. &quot;Butthe people of Eastern Europe haven't thrown off theirCommunist oppressors simply to be conned by some Westernindustrialist offering Third World wages. They've had 45years of watching a privileged Communist elite skim off thecream. Now they want to be the new Japan, with economicprosperity for all, not just the few.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
