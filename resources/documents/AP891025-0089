But Siddhi, the first top official to confirm that the westerntown of Pailin was in guerrilla hands, said neither the Cambodiangovernment nor guerrilla forces are strong enough to win a clearvictory.   ``In the end they will have to compromise and come back tonegotiations,'' he told a weekly news briefing.   The guerrillas said the victory Sunday opened the door for anassault 40 miles to the northeast on Battambang, Cambodia'ssecond-largest city after the nation's capital, Pnom Penh.   Khmer Rouge Army radio on Tuesday called on officials andsoldiers of Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government to quit.   ``Parents and compatriots ... please call on your children andhusbands to quickly desert for home ... in order to stay alive,''said the broadcast, a text of which was seen in Bangkok today.   Army officers had vowed to hold onto Pailin's gem-rich areaseized by the Khmer Rouge, who have been fighting to topple thegovernment for the past 11 years.   Thailand is leading efforts to restart the peace process,stalled since the failure of an international conference in Parisin August.   The main stumbling block was the Cambodian government's refusalto agree to a government role for the Khmer Rouge, which massacredhundreds of thousands of Cambodians during four years of rulebefore Vietnam invaded in 1978 and ousted it from power. The KhmerRouge tried to turn Cambodia into an agrarian commune.   Asked if the Khmer Rouge controlled Pailin, the minister said,``Yes it is true.'' He added that according to Thai militaryreports, the guerrillas captured nine artillery pieces, four tanks,six trucks and large quantities of ammunition in their assault onthe town.   Thai military sources said Cambodian government forces hadpulled back to Route 10 linking Pailin with Battambang, theprovincial capital, but the Khmer Rouge continued its attacks andwas trying to seize more territory.   The Khmer Rouge killed 120 government soldiers and captured 17in their final assualt on Pailin, the sources said.   The Communist Khmer Rouge is the strongest member of theguerrilla coalition that also includes the non-Communist KhmerPeople's National Liberation Front and the army of Prince NorodomSihanouk.   The two non-Communist groups also have scored significantvictories in western Cambodia north of Pailin since late September,when Vietnam said it pulled out the last of its troops.   Siddhi said today it was uncertain the two factions could holdon to their gains.   On Tuesday, heavy fighting was reported along Route 69 as theguerrillas of the liberation front advanced towards Svey Chek,which they described as the only barrier between them and thestrategic town of Sisophon.   Dien Del, deputy commander of the front, claimed Tuesday hisgroup seized eight small government outposts and cut Route 69 southand north of Svey Chek.</TEXT></DOC>
