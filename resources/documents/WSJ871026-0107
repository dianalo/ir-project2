MillerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Reports of the demise of Wall Street's yuppies are greatly exaggerated.    Following last week's stock-market crash, millions of Americans found some solace in the thought that the financial industry's young upstarts might finally be getting theirs. A New York Post cartoon showed an auto with &quot;YUPPIE&quot; on the license plate slamming into a brick wall. Battered investors had visions of 25-year-old millionaires lining up at soup kitchens or trading their BMWs for apple carts.    But such hopes quickly fade when you listen to people like Michael R. Smith, a 34-year-old E.F. Hutton broker with a six-figure salary. His pre-crash plans to buy a $250,000 Manhattan co-op and a share in a $400,000 Connecticut home are unchanged. So is the aggressive sales style that made him rich: Last week he netted a tidy commission by persuading a client to pour $150,000 into the market.    &quot;If I'm afraid of this market, I don't deserve to be a broker,&quot; Mr. Smith says. &quot;Fear is good business.&quot;    Far from demoralizing Wall Street's youths -- or denting their bank accounts -- the volatile stock market seems to have rekindled their enthusiasm. Many say they are exhilarated by the market's wild swings and claim that the current risks will only make them richer.    &quot;Volatility creates opportunity,&quot; says Steven P. Nassau, 30, a senior vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He fears not for his six-month-old son, his apartment in tony Brooklyn Heights, his three-bedroom house in Connecticut or his plans to trade up to a four-bedroom home. In fact, he figures the crash will create some bargains in the housing market as the newly bankrupt vacate their plush homes.    While Newsweek's cover story last week asked &quot;Is the Party Over?&quot; for &quot;Wall Street's Whiz Kids,&quot; some of the young and fearless at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. chose Friday night to have a big blowout to celebrate the exciting week they had just spent. The invitation: copies of the gloomy Newsweek cover emblazoned with a rude rejoinder: &quot;N.F.W.&quot; Loosely translated: &quot;No Feasible Way.&quot;    The damn-the-torpedoes talk isn't heard in every quarter. Carter L. Burgess Jr., a reinsurance broker, attempts to joke about his losses over a beer with some friends. &quot;I lost my potential honeymoon,&quot; says Mr. Burgess, who plans to marry in June. &quot;We were going on a safari to Africa. Now, I'm going to New Jersey. I hear they've got a great Holiday Inn in Bayonne.&quot; But as one companion turns to leave, Mr. Burgess is whispering, disheartened, to a friend: &quot;I'm laughing outside, but crying inside.&quot;    Such misgivings, however, don't appear to be shared by many of Mr. Burgess's colleagues. More than ever, Wall Street's young and newly rich believe the future of American finance lies with them, not with old-timers -- someone age 40, for example -- whom they see clogging up the corporate ranks above them.    &quot;This is kind of mean,&quot; says a 24-year-old analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., speaking from his limousine phone outside Boston, &quot;but for some of us, the real problem {was} the fleshy middle layer. The odds of sprinting up the corporate ladder were fairly small. Now a lot of these 40-year-old managing directors have been fired, so the people who survive feel this is an opportunity.&quot;    The young traders say the market is now cheap -- and almost foolproof. Forrest Jay Radin, a 30-year-old broker at Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben Inc., ticks off a list of his post-plunge bargains: Telex at $42 instead of $65; TWA at $14 instead of $26; Kansas City Southern at $40 instead of $79. &quot;It's one giant casino. You're looking at greed,&quot; he says excitedly. &quot;There are buys out there. As long as {clients} buy, I make a commission. When I make a commission, I go to Las Vegas.&quot;    Even those who should be especially alarmed -- new arrivals to the Street who would be the first dumped in a shakeout -- profess to be thrilled. &quot;I think it's great,&quot; says Timothy Joyce, 22, a rookie in Prudential-Bache Inc.'s bond department who hopes to be a trader. &quot;It can only help me in the long run. When I'm a trader, I'm just going to have this under my belt.&quot;    Of course, if the yuppies' current market theory -- buy now when everything is suddenly cheap and exciting -- is wrong, its proponents may yet line up at soup kitchens, along with their clients.    Some are in trouble already. Laura J. Sloate, 42, chairwoman of Sloate Weissman Murray andamp; Co., a small brokerage house, tells of a young $200,000-a-month star at one giant Wall Street firm who turned down a rival house's job offer two weeks ago. After &quot;Black Monday,&quot; however, he hurried back to the suitor to say he had changed his mind. Why? His entire client list had abandoned him after his advice had cost them millions of dollars in disastrous options trades. &quot;Now who's going to take his cold calls?&quot; she asks.    &quot;These guys,&quot; says seasoned broker Richard A. Wilburn, &quot;they don't see the threat of the whole collapse of the banking and credit system of this country. They just figure they can find a whole new pot full of suckers to play the game.&quot;    Even though many of Wall Street's shrewdest veterans bluntly admit they have no idea how to play the new market, their junior partners have some impressive-sounding answers. &quot;I expected a substantial adjustment in the stock market,&quot; says Andrew Farkas, 26, who runs a small investment boutique from a downtown Manhattan loft. His post-crash wisdom: &quot;If you acquire a hard asset for a value and you don't leverage yourself too highly and you manage something correctly, you'll be fine and you'll do well.&quot;    Most of the young brokers weren't around for the two big market downturns of the 1970s. Michael S. Falk, a 25-year-old trader-and self-proclaimed millionaire who works at D.H. Blair andamp; Co., was in the 10th grade at Bayside High School in Queens during the most recent major slide, in 1977. He was only a sixth-grader when the market plunged sharply in 1973. Now this market, he says, &quot;will separate the men from the boys.&quot;    They also see no need to ask their elders for advice; they reason that no one has ever experienced a market this volatile, a drop this deep. The Las Vegas-bound Mr. Radin says he lost more than $8,000 in the market last week -- but turned around and won $500 on the World Series. &quot;Guys in the business 30 years have never seen anything like it themselves,&quot; he says of the market plunge. &quot;What older guy is going to tell a young kid about that?&quot;    ---   Joanne Lipman contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
