But the officials decided not to reduce the exposure or informthe workers out of fear that changing procedures and equipmentcould disrupt nuclear testing, according to Thursday editions ofthe Times.   The documents were made available to the newspaper by Las Vegaslawyers Alan R. Johns and Larry C. Johns, who allege in a lawsuitagainst the government that radiation from bomb tests caused thecancer deaths of 200 Nevada Test Site employees and cancer illnessin 18 others.   According to minutes of a Sept. 23, 1952, meeting of the AtomicEnergy Commission, predecessor of the Department of Energy, ``thecommissioners expressed concern that workers might be exposed toradiation hazards for too long a time.''   Two weeks later, the commissioners were told that the programfor determining how much radiation hundreds of workers were exposedto was not reliable, the Times said.   By May 13, 1953, some commissioners were calling for thereduction of worker exposures by lowering the government's annualsafety limit, which stood then at 12 rems.   Dr. John C. Bugher, the AEC's chief health officer at the time,advised against lowering the limit, saying it ``would make itimpossible to conduct operations at the test site without majorchanges.''   Today the annual safety limit is five rems. Rems measureradiation doses.   The records show miners were ordered soon after nuclear blaststo recover instruments from tunnel filled with radioactive dust andcontaminated debris. In the 1950s, workers cleaned up rubble atdetonation sites without respirators to protect their lungs, theTimes said.   On Nov. 24, 1961, 108 miners were pulled from two tunnels afterthey absorbed doses exceeding safety limits. The miners wereoffered as much beer as they could drink for a week to flush thecontaminants from their bodies, the Times said.   On June 6, 1963, 13 miners who had been clearing rubble from atunnel on the night shift were found to be contaminated byradioactive iodine produced by a test in the tunnel the day before.Miners on the next shift were ordered to continue work in thetunnel despite the contamination, the Times said.</TEXT></DOC>
