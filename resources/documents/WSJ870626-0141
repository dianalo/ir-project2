Now that scientists have the green light to tinker all they want with the genetics of animals, I have some thoughts on the types of new strains they should be concentrating on.    The truly useful animal of the future ought to be able to do more than just play dead, stand on its hind legs or lay a few eggs now and then. Animal lovers may be offended, but the days of the free ride are over for both man and beast.    Here are some types of animals that could be useful to society:    --Pooper Spaniels. Spaniels with flat tails like beavers' that could clean up after themselves on our sidewalks and streets.    --Mopgrels or Maxie Waxies. A breed of dog or cat with loads of thick hair. They could be trained to lie on their backs while being gingerly poked in the stomach by a broom handle and pushed around a wet kitchen floor. What a time saver! You could do the floors and play with Prince or Blackie at the same time.    --Starlet Chickens. All breast. No wings or legs or thighs. Chickens don't use their wings to fly, and there's no reason they have to have legs. Ever try going for a walk with a chicken or sending one out to retrieve the paper? Building a better chicken means building one with all white meat. An added benefit: Goodbye and good riddance to Buffalo wings.    --Haagensteins and Coca-Cowlas. The former are cows capable of surviving in extremely cold environments for short periods. When &quot;milked,&quot; they would give soft ice cream. The latter, cows fed a diet of black syrup, would produce cola. Don't turn your nose up. This is a very American idea. We are always trying to do away with the middleman, and both of these would do the trick.    --Newshawks. Parrots with bigger heads and greatly enhanced powers of retention. With the right genetic mix, this new and improved parrot could be left alone in a room with CNN on all day. By the time the owner came home, the parrot would be set to relate all the important events of the past 10 hours in capsule form, eliminating the need to waste half an hour on the evening news.    --Saucelings. These guys (a.k.a. pigs) would wallow 'round the clock in barbecue sauce instead of mud. When the creature was put on a spit, a special ingredient in the sauce would instantly ignite the coals. Think of the savings on matches, charcoal starters and tempers (in inverse order, no doubt).    This is obviously only a partial list, a jumping-off point intended to get the creative juices of geneticists going. Speaking of juices, how about working on a real duck &quot;a l'orange,&quot; a pet duck you keep around the house and squeeze in the belly every morning for fresh orange juice with no seeds or pulp?    And speaking of bellies, would anyone like to see a new strain of rabbits with long stiff ears? You could set the rabbit on your ankles and grab hold of its ears while doing sit-ups. They could be called Belly Busting Bunnies.    No? Well, then come up with your own suggestions. If we -- Joe and Jane Average -- don't provide some input soon these mad scientists will go their merry way, breeding flocks of useless four-legged Edsels with 17 udders, antlers, a kangaroo pouch and, at least on the export models, an optional tape deck.    ---   Mr. McCoy, who lives in Rockville Centre, N.Y., has never owned a pet. </TEXT></DOC>
