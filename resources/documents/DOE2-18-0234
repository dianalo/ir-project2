The process involves twoprincipal steps: 1) the reaction of natural gas with steam and air toyield a gaseous mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen, and 2) the reactionof nitrogen and hydrogen to yield ammonia. The analyses were performedusing a version of Aspen Plus, a state-of-the-art process simulationcode, which has been enhanced by the authors for energy and exergy analyses.Overall efficiencies of approximately 45%, based on energy and exergyratios, were obtained for the process. Of the total energy losses, 80%was found to be associated with emissions of cooling water, and 20% withemissions of stack gas. Almost 90% of the total exergy losses was foundto be associated with internal consumptions. The results may prove valuableto those involved in the design, optimization and modifications of ammoniaproduction plants.</TEXT></DOC>
