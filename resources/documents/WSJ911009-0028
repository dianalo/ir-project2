They have every right to expect that the reviewer ofa serious book on culture would know what he is talkingabout.</LP><TEXT>   Despite its problems -- and they are severe and many, asthey are in most big cities -- Philadelphia has much to offerculturally. Its medical schools are among the finest in thecountry, and it has several very good universities. TheWharton School, for example, is one of the top three businessschools. The colleges in and around the city offer a choiceof first-class educational options one would be hard pressedto find elsewhere. Swarthmore, Haverford and Bryn Mawr arejust a few.   The Philadelphia Orchestra is famous world-wide; thecity's art museums are excellent; and Fairmount Park is thelargest park within city limits in the U.S. The Free PublicLibrary was born in Philadelphia, as was fire insurance andthe modern department store.   Even if Mr. Ferguson couldn't resist a W.C. Fields typewisecrack, you should have deleted it in the interest ofaccuracy.   Paul Martin   Philadelphia</TEXT></DOC>
