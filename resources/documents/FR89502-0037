The first consideration is the time intervalfrom the time the airplane comes to rest until a fire or explosion withinthe cabin makes survival virtually impossible. The second is the rapiditywith which occupants can egress. The FAA recently adopted new standardsfor the flammability of seat cushions (Amendments 25-59, 29-23 and 121-184,49 FR 43188; October 26, 1984) and other large-surface interior components,such as sidewalls and ceilings (Amendments 25-61 and 121-189, 51 FR 26206;July 21, 1986). These new standards will provide occupants more time inwhich to egress by delaying the spread of fire through the cabin. Amendments25-58 and 121-183 (49 FR 43182; October 26, 1984) were also adopted torequire floor proximity emergency escape path markings which enable occupantsto evacuate the airplane more rapidly. Other new standards are also beingdeveloped to enhance the safe evacuation of occupants. Because a typical post-crash fire originates with rupture of the fuel tanksand subsequent ignition of large quantities of spilled fuel, the FAA hasalso considered means to improve the probability of safe evacuation byeliminating or reducing the spillage and ignition of fuel. In 1964, theFAA considered adopting standards for crash-resistant fuel tanks, self-closingbreakaway fuel line fittings, and engine ignition suppression systems fortransport category airplanes. It was found, however, that insufficienttechnical information existed at that time to provide a basis for developingregulatory standards. Subsequently, the FAA considered other means to mitigatethe post-crash fire and explosion hazard, such as fuel tank inerting andsuppression systems. In response to a recommendation made in 1971 by theNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and a subsequent petition forrulemaking made in 1972 by the Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP),the FAA issued Notice 74-16 (39 FR 12260; April 4, 1974) proposing to requirethe installation of means to prevent fuel system explosion. As a resultof the comments made in response to Notice 74-16, the FAA determined thatsuch means would have little or no effect in reducing post-crash fire andexplosion hazards when fuel is spilled from damaged tanks. It was alsoconcluded in a 1977 public hearing that crash-resistant, wing-mounted fueltanks would not be effective in view of the wing damage and separationsthat had occurred in several impact-survivable accidents. As a result ofthe information gained from the public hearing, the FAA withdrew Notice74-16 in 1978 and established the Special Aviation Fire and Explosion Reduction(SAFER) Advisory Committee to evaluate possible means to improve survivabilityin the post-crash event. The SAFER Committee assessed various schemes for reducing post-crash firehazards, including the use of breakaway fittings. As a result of theirrecommendations, rulemaking concerning new standards for transport categoryairplanes concerning fuel tank vent protection, shutoff of the engine fuelsupply at the fuel tank in the event of a crash landing, and upgraded emergencylanding design requirements is in process. Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(ANPRM) 84-17 (49 FR 38078; September 26, 1984) was issued to obtain additionalinformation in those areas. The FAA currently is considering issuing anNPRM on this matter. In separate rulemaking, the FAA proposed to require strengthened fuel tankaccess panels on transport category airplanes to preclude loss of fuel(Notice 88-10; 53 FR 18256; May 23, 1988). A final rule based on Notice88-10 will be considered. The use of anti-misting fuels appeared promising at first as a means ofreducing the possibility of post-crash fire. Research and development testshave since shown that such fuels are ineffective in reducing the threatof fire and explosion and are impractical for use in air carrier operations.Unless there are future developments in such fuels which would make themeffective and practical, the FAA would not propose any rulemaking in thatregard.Although crashworthy fuel tanks were not considered effective with respectto the wing fuel tanks of transport category airplanes, the FAA is conductinga research and development program with fuselage-mounted fuel tanks toevaluate possible fuel containment design criteria and to determine whethernew or revised design standards are necessary. In regard to general aviation airplanes, the FAA completed a research anddevelopment program in 1978. In that program, full-scale tests were completedwith twin-engine airplanes equipped with crash-resistant bladder cellsin the wing fuel tanks and breakaway fittings on the filler and vent fittings.Those tests demonstrated that crash-resistant fuel cells and breakawayfittings could reduce post crash fires in such airplanes. As a result ofthis testing and NTSB recommendations, the FAA is proposing to requirethese design features for small airplanes, including commuter categoryairplanes. In that regard, the FAA currently is considering issuing anNPRM on this matter. The success of crash-resistant fuel systems in rotorcraft operated by theU.S. Army has prompted the FAA to review and consider similar installationsfor civil rotorcraft. As a result, an NPRM will be considered in whichnew standards for improved crash-resistance of the fuel systems in civilrotorcraft will be proposed. In regard to possible further action, the FAA has recently completed astudy pertaining to aircraft designs and equipment which would furtherminimize the incidence of post-crash fires or explosions. The results ofthat study will be contained in a report which will describe the feasibilityof possible improvements for transport category airplanes, general aviationairplanes and rotorcraft. Congress recently enacted House Resolution HR 4686, ``Aviation Safety ResearchAct of 1988,'' which was signed by the President on November 3, 1988 (Pub.L. 100-591). Section 9(a) of the Act requires the Administrator of theFAA to issue an ANPRM within 90 days following the date of enactment todetermine the feasibility of installing in all air carrier aircraft crashworthyfuselage fuel tanks and fuselage fuel lines which are rupture-resistantand which disconnect and seal in the event of an accident. Such actionis intended to ensure greater safety to passengers of air carriers andto reduce the incidence of post-crash fires. In light of ongoing rulemakingfor small airplanes and rotorcraft, the requirement to issue an ANPRM isconsidered to apply to transport category airplanes and the operators ofsuch airplanes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Information </ITAG>Before initiating further rulemaking, the FAA must determine the feasibilityand the effectiveness of installing crashworthy fuselage fuel tanks intransport category airplanes and fuselage fuel lines in such airplaneswhich are rupture resistant and which disconnect and seal in the eventof an accident. The FAA therefore requests comments in that regard fromthe public, including the aviation industry, airplane manufacturers (bothdomestic and foreign) and any other interested persons. This informationmay include technical and economic data and information, arguments proor con concerning the need for new standards, and any other informationdeemed pertinent. The modern commercial transport category airplane requires maximum safety;however, new protective features must be justified by an increased levelof safety with a minimum of added complexity, weight and operational constraints.Estimates of probable costs and benefits derived from installing crashworthyfuel tanks and fuel lines are important and are necessary for initiationof any further rulemaking actions. The FAA is particularly interested in comments regarding the followingspecific questions: 1. What criteria should be developed and used to define a crash-resistantfuel system (tanks and fuel lines)? 2. As has been suggested, would the criteria of Military SpecificationMIL-T-27422B Tank, Crash-resistant, Aircraft, dated February 24, 1970,including Amendment 1, dated April 13, 1971, Type II, non-self-sealing,Class A flexible cell construction, be a suitable standard? 3. Is it feasible, both from technological and economical standpoints,to design and install crash-resistant fuel systems? 4. Would such systems be effective in preventing or reducing post-crashfires? 5. Are there any possible hazardous side effects which might result fromthe installation of such systems? 6. In regard to applicability, what should be the scope of the new standards,for example: a. An amendment to Part 25 which would apply only to transport categoryairplanes for which an application for type certificate is made after theeffective date of the amendment; b. Amendments to Parts 121 and 135, which would require all airplanes manufacturedafter a specified date to meet the new standards regardless of the dateof application for type certificate if they are operated under the provisionsof the latter Parts by air carrier, air taxi or commercial operators; c. Amendments to Parts 121 and 135 which would require existing airplanesto be modified to meet the new standards, if they are operated by air carrier,air taxi, or commercial operators regardless of the date of applicationfor type certificate or the date of manufacture; or d. All of the above? 7. Is there a minimum tank volume below which the standards need not apply?8. In regard to tank location, should the standards apply only to fuselage-mountedfuel tanks, or should they apply to tanks located in other areas, suchas the vertical fin or stabilizer, as well?  9. In regard to the scope of airplane applicability, should any airplanesbe excluded due to their age, size, or other considerations? 10. How many labor hours would be required to install such tanks and lines,and what is the typical labor rate? 11. What are the weight penalties, if any, which might result from compliancewith new fuel system standards? 12. Are tank and line components which would comply with such new standardsavailable, or will they be available on a timely basis? 13. What would be the expected service life of the various components ofcrashworthy fuel tanks and fuel lines? 14. What would be the earliest date by which airplanes in service couldbe modified to comply with such fuel system standards? 15. What are the cost estimates relative to:a. The design, manufacture and installation of crash-resistant fuel tanksand fuel lines with frangible or breakaway couplings and fittings for futureairplane designs; b. The design, manufacture and installation of such tanks and lines inother newly manufactured airplanes; c. The design, manufacture and installation of such tanks and lines inairplanes which are already manufactured and in service; d. Lost revenue, if any, while airplanes are being modified to meet newstandards; e. Any reduction in aircraft range due to the installation of crashworthyfuel tanks; f. Any weight penalties resulting from the installation of such tanks andlines; g. Maintenance and routine replacement of components in service; and h. The total annual cost of compliance with such standards? 16. What are the potential benefits which might be realized due to theinstallation of such tanks and lines? 17. Are there possible alternate means to achieve the objectives of installingsuch tanks and lines which might be less costly? <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation </ITAG>An important consideration in the FAA regulatory process is the examinationof the benefits and costs of rulemaking action. Agencies of the Federalgovernment are required by Executive Order 12291 to adopt only those regulatoryprograms in which the potential benefits to society outweigh the potentialcosts to society. The objective of this ANPRM is to determine the feasibility of installingin all air carrier aircraft crashworthy fuselage fuel tanks and fuselagefuel lines which are rupture resistant and which disconnect and seal inthe event of an accident. No specific standards or methods of meeting thosevery general goals have been identified or proposed at this time. If it is determined that existing fuel tanks and fuel line technology canbe utilized to produce a significant increase in passenger safety, thecost of meeting those general goals would be relatively low. On the otherhand, it may be determined that it is impossible to design fuel tanks andfuel line fittings which would produce a significant increase in passengersafety with the large volumes of fuel required for transport category airplanes.Because of this current uncertainty as to the feasibility of regulatoryaction, it is impossible for the FAA to prepare a meaningful regulatoryevaluation at this time. The additional information which the FAA would need to prepare a regulatoryevaluation for any specific standards is reflected in the questions posedabove under the heading ``Request for Information.'' Any further actionwhich is based on information received in response to this ANPRM, and whichcontains specific proposed action, will, of course, be accompanied by athorough regulatory evaluation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG> This ANPRM seeks information from interested persons, including manufacturersand users of transport category airplanes and components, the general public,both foreign and domestic, and foreign airworthiness authorities in determiningthe feasibility for installing a crash-resistant fuel system and new airworthinessstandards. Preliminary evaluation indicates that this document is significantunder DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979). Information is being requested and no economic or regulatory impactis imposed on any person by this action. A full regulatory evaluation willbe prepared if further rulemaking is warranted based on comments receivedas a result of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on April 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">M.C.
