By a 6-3 vote, the justices ordered further lower court hearingsin a suit against the accounting firm Price Waterhouse by AnnHopkins, who said she was denied a partnership because of ``macho''attitudes that she did not behave sufficiently ladylike.   Today's ruling also is a partial victory for Price Waterhouse.The court overturned a lower court ruling that would have placed aneven heavier burden of proof on the company.   Moreover, only four of the justices agreed on the standards thatshould govern lawsuits alleging sexual stereoptyping.   The absence of a court majority enunciating clear guidelines islikely to sow confusion among lower courts when deciding such cases.   Justice William J. Brennan, in the court's main opinion, saidwhen someone ``proves that her gender played a motivating part inan employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding ofliability only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence thatit would have made the same decision even if it had not taken theplantiff's gender into account.''   Joining his opinion were Justices Thurgood Marshall, John PaulStevens and Harry A. Blackmun.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in a separate concurring opinion,agreed that in the case of Price Waterhouse, ``the burden ofpersuasion should shift to the employer to demonstrate by apreponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the samedecision concerning Ann Hopkins' candidacy absent consideration ofher gender.''   But O'Connor said she does not favor ``the strong medicine'' offorcing employers to bear the burden of proof in all such cases.   Justice Byron R. White also concurred in today's result. But ina separate opinion he said he would not require an employer tosubmit ``objective evidence'' to disprove sexual bias in such cases.   As long as ``the employer credibly testifies that the actionwould have been taken for legitimate reasons alone, this should beample proof,'' White said.   The three dissenters are Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist andJustices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. They voted to killMs. Hopkins' suit.   Kennedy, in his opinion for the three, said there was ampleevidence that Price Waterhouse did not discriminate against herintentionally.   Ms. Hopkins quit Price Waterhouse, one of the nation's so-called``Big Eight'' accounting firms, after she was denied promotion topartnership in 1983 _ a move that would have made her a part owner.   She later became a consultant to the World Bank.   In other actions today, the Supreme Court:   _Agreed to review a challenge to review to the partial merger ofDetroit's two daily newspapers. The justices said they will judgethe validity of former Attorney General Edwin Meese's decision toallow the newspapers to form a joint operating agreement.   _Agreed to hear a Bush administration apeal aimed at allowingthe government to collect potentially hundreds of millions ofdollars in taxes from multinational corporations.   _Refused to hear an appeal by Hawaii officials seeking torecover from asbestos manufacturers the cost of removing theproduct from public schools in the state.   In the sex bias case, Ms. Hopkins had joined Price Waterhouse in1978 and was nominated for parntership in 1982, the only womanamong 88 candidates for partnership that year.   She had been very successful in getting business for thecompany, winning government contracts worth between $34 million and$44 million.   Both her critics and supporters at Price Watershouse said shesometimes was overly agreessive, too harsh, impatient with herstaff and very demanding.   One critic suggested she needed to take a ``course at charmschool.''   A partner who supported her for promotion told her she wouldstand a better chance of getting ahead if she would ``walk morefemininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wearmake-up, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.''   Ms. Hopkins sued Price Waterhouse on grounds it violated TitleVII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting on-the-jobdiscrimination. She said sexual stereotyping, unconscious orotherwise, cost her a partnership.   Professinal partnerships are covered by the 1964 law under a1984 Supreme Court ruling.   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled in 1987 that whilethere appeared to be mixed motives in denying Ms. Hopkins apartnership, Price Waterhouse was unable to prove that``impermissible bias was not the determinative factor'' for thedecision.   The appeals court said an employer must show by ``clear andconvincing evidence'' they did not practice bias.   The Supreme Court today did not go that far.   The ``clear and convincing'' standard usually means that tosuccessfully defend against a lawsuit, a company must show that theoverwhelming evidence is in its favor.   By contrast, the ``preponderance'' standard adopted today meansPrice Waterhouse can win if it can show more than half the evidenceis in its favor.   The case is Price Waterhouse vs. Hopkins, 87-1167.</TEXT></DOC>
