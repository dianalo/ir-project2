Michael Marcus, a former official of Gnau andamp; Associates, pleaded guilty to two felony counts of assisting in the payment of $5,000 in illegal gratuities to Peter Voss, former vice chairman of the Postal Service's board of governors.    Mr. Voss, who pleaded guilty last spring to trying to steer a $250 million postal contract to Recognition Equipment Inc. of Dallas, received a four-year sentence and was fined $11,000. John Gnau Jr., chairman of Gnau andamp; Associates, last month was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $10,000, after admitting his involvement in the scheme.    According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Valder, Mr. Marcus prepared bids for Recognition as part of Recognition's effort to win a contract to produce automated mail-sorting machines. Mr. Valder told U.S. District Court Judge George Revercomb that Mr. Marcus was &quot;the brains of the operation,&quot; the technical expert who knew how to make the proposals sound good. Recognition hasn't been charged in the case.    Mr. Marcus knew that his boss, Mr. Gnau, would pay kickbacks to Mr. Voss, but Mr. Marcus didn't actually make the payments himself, prosecutors said. Federal law prohibits both direct and indirect involvement in the payment of kickbacks.    Mr. Marcus couldn't be reached for comment. His sentencing was set for March 10, and he could receive up to four years in prison and a $500,000 fine. </TEXT></DOC>
