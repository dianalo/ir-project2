SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Law enforcement is a lonesome job in nearly athousand American communities with one-officer police departments,according to a government study.   Although some big cities and counties boast thousands ofofficers, nearly half of all police and sheriff's departments havefewer than 10 officers, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported onSunday.   Law enforcement agencies ranged in size from 34 policedepartments and 12 sheriff's offices with more than 1,000 officersapiece to the 987 departments with just one, according to the study,the first detailed statistical analysis of local law enforcementstaffing.   All state police agencies, 99 percent of sheriff's offices and 97percent of local police agencies with 135 or more officers requireat least a high school diploma, the 1987 study found. A separateanalysis of police standards in 1967 found only 70 percent requiredsuch a diploma.   In fact, the new study found, about 10 percent of the largerpolice departments and 6 percent of sheriff's operations are nowrequiring prospective officers to have at least some collegeeducation.   The Justice Department report said that overall the nation has11,989 local police departments, 3,080 sheriff's departments and 49state police agencies. Hawaii has no state police, even though sucha department was once featured in the television show ``HawaiiFive-0.''   Nationally, law enforcement agencies had 757,508 employeesincluding 555,364 sworn officers.   Of those agencies 52.6 percent of local police departments havefewer than 10 officers and 79 percent have under 25, the reportfound. Among sheriff's offices, 33.6 percent had under 10 deputiesand 67.3 percent had fewer than 25.   Thus, of the 15,057 local police and sheriff's agencies, 48.7percent had fewer than 10 officers.   Sheriff's departments led the way in employing women, at 12.5percent of their sworn deputies, the report found. Women constituted7.6 percent of local police officers and only 4.2 percent of statetroopers.   Blacks were more strongly represented on local policedepartments, making up 9.3 percent of the officers. Sheriff'soffices reported 8.3 percent black deputies and state police laggedwith 6.5 percent.   Average annual starting salaries for police officers ranged from$13,768 in the smallest departments to $23,000 in cities of amillion people or more. Local police chiefs were paid salaries ofbetween $18,503 and $87,044.   Salaries and wages accounted for six of every seven dollars spenton police work by governments. Total police spending was $28.3billion.   Two-thirds of the departments that have 135 or more officers saidthey allow collective bargaining.   Nationwide, 31.7 percent of police agencies and 28.3 percent ofsheriff's departments said they participated in the 911 emergencytelephone system. The highest rate was 88 percent for police incities of between 250,000 and 500,000 people. Sheriff's officesserving communities of under 10,000 reported that only 15.7 percenthad the 911 system in use.   The responsibilities of the law enforcement agencies vary fromplace to place in addition to regular peacekeeping functions.   Nearly half of the departments are also responsible for animalcontrol in their communities, for example, and one in four handlesemergency medical services.   Other special functions include court security, handled by 22percent of the departments; civil defense, 21 percent; civil processserving, 18 percent; jail operation, 12 percent; training academy, 6percent; drug testing, 4 percent; and ballistics testing, 2 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
