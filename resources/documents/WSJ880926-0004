Fostering this outlook are crumbling gold prices, the strong U.S. trade performance in July and foreign buying interest, all seen as influences that continue to back the dollar even though U.S. interest rates have steadied.    Bullish dollar sentiment also lingers although the Group of Seven major industrialized nations is apparently pleased with current dollar levels and uncertainties about the coming presidential election continue to hold the dollar back.    &quot;We are building the platform&quot; for a major test of the dollar's upside, says a New York foreign exchange trading manager who requested anonymity.    &quot;I don't think you can look for huge movements,&quot; but the bias is currently toward the upside, he says.    He looks for the dollar to trade as high as 1.89 marks this week if it breaks above major resistance at 1.88 marks. Against the Japanese currency, he sees the dollar rising as high as 135.50.    Late Friday in New York, the dollar stood at 1.8750 marks and 134.38 yen, having gained from 1.8709 marks and 134.08 yen a week earlier.    In mid-morning trading in Tokyo Monday, the U.S. currency was trading at about 134.75 yen.    News Friday of the unexpectedly large 6% rise in August U.S. durable goods orders revived hopes for higher U.S. interest rates and pushed the dollar toward the 1.88 mark level.    However, that climb was thwarted by reports the New York Federal Reserve Bank was checking currency levels, an action that sometimes foreshadows intervention. The central bank reportedly sold dollars around 1.88 marks last Thursday.    According to many traders, that resistance may not hold for much longer.    &quot;Right now we're still seeing signs of dollar strength,&quot; says Michael Ballow, a broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    Some of this underpinning stems from gold's descent to its lowest levels since 1987, which has sent some buying interest the dollar's way.    Friday, spot gold at the Commodity Exchange in New York settled $5.30 lower at $394 an ounce. A week earlier, it stood at $411.70. Among influences pounding on the metal are a drop in worries about U.S. inflation, chart-related selling and a lack of buying interest.    Monday was a public holiday in Hong Kong and there wasn't a gold quote.    Gold's fall has been a mixed blessing for the dollar. While it has aided the U.S. currency, traders note the speculative interest that sent the dollar rocketing higher during the summer has now moved to the precious metals front.    &quot;There's not enough overall speculative interest&quot; for both the markets to move sharply at once, says Richard Levine, a broker for Elders Futures Inc.    &quot;Once gold stabilizes, I think they'll go back to currencies,&quot; he predicts.    Also, the impact of the latest U.S. trade data continues to buoy the dollar. The trade gap stood at $9.5 billion in July, its lowest level in more than three years, mainly because of an 8.9% drop in imports.    &quot;I don't think the market has reacted all that positively to the (July) trade data yet,&quot; says Bob Giordano, chief currency dealer at Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York.    Meanwhile, traders say foreign investors continue to show interest in U.S. stocks and bonds, which is also an influence swinging in the dollar's favor.    This week's Treasury financing, especially the sale Wednesday of $7 billion of four-year notes, could be aided by buying from newly formed Japanese funds that focus on dollar-denominated securities with maturities as long as five years, some debt market analysts say.    However, economists say a possible snag in the expected Japanese purchases is that the notes settle Sept. 30, which coincides with the end of the Japanese fiscal year. Japanese investors tend to shy away for bookkeeping reasons from establishing new holdings near the end of the fiscal year.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                 Friday, September 23, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
