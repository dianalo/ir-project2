Erosion is outpacing soil replenishment, passing the``tolerance'' level accepted by most conservationists, on anestimated 277 million acres of non-federal rural land _ more thanCalifornia and Texas combined.   ``About 173 million of these acres are cropland, on which erosionwas 2.3 billion tons in 1982,'' the report said. ``If leftunchecked, erosion will reduce the ability of the soil to produceneeded food and fiber.''   Further, it said, the silt from eroded soil can damage land, airand water. Total costs are virtually impossible to pinpoint, but onestudy estimates that water erosion alone costs the nation $3 billionto $13 billion each year.   The new report updates the department's National ConservationProgram developed in 1982 in response to the Soil and WaterResources Conservation Act of 1977. The law, or RCA, requiredlong-range conservation planning by the department for programsaffecting soil and water conservation on non-federal lands.   Assistant Secretary George Dunlop said that the protection ofwater quality ranks with erosion abatement in the AgricultureDepartment's list of priorities. In 1982, he said, the prioritieswere erosion control, and water conservation and upstream floodcontrol.   Dunlop said additional areas that have come in for greaterconsideration in recent years include the expansion of``conservation partnership'' with states, local government's andlandowners; working with small-scale, poorer and minority farmers;improving the consistency of programs, and cutting costs.   Conditions have changed markedly since the 1977 law was passed,the report said. At that time the prices of agricultural commoditiesand the volume of exports were increasing.   ``Famine was stalking many countries, and reports of worldresource degradation were increasing,'' the report said. ``Adding tothe concern was a perception that technology, which had providedcontinuous increases in agricultural productivity for decades, wasnot likely to provide similar increases in the future.''   But in the early 1980s, the situation sharply reversed, with adrop in world demand, a global recession and serious debt problemsin many importing countries. At the same time, world agriculturalproduction was rising, and surpluses grew.   One result was renewed attention to conservation and the 1977law's process for looking ahead to solving soil and water problems,the report said.   The 1985 farm law included authorization of the ConservationReserve Program, or CRP, which enables farmers to take highlyerodible land from crop production for 10 years and protect it withgrass and tree plantings.   Congress set a goal of 40 million to 45 million acres in the CRPby the end of 1990. About 28.2 million acres have been enrolled inthe program.   According to the report, the CRP already has had a major impacton erosion and is currently saving 530 million tons of soilannually. By 1995, it said, the fully operational CRP is expected tosave 800 million tons of soil per year, thus reducing total U.S.erosion losses on non-federal land by 15 percent.   Robert J. Gray, policy director for the private, non-profitAmerican Farmland Trust, said the USDA figures on saving soil areimpressive but that ``no one has been able to really spot check thefields'' to determine if the claims are correct.</TEXT></DOC>
