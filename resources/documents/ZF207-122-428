DeGroot, out of the section altogether.andM;DeGroot will become director of international technology.andM;Richard D. Weirich, director of the Office of Telecommunications Technology,has been named as acting assistant postmaster general for IRM.andM;Top IRM officials would not comment on the reorganization or give anyspecifics until the plan is approved, sometime later next month.andM;But sources said the reorganization involves more than job shifts, includingcreation of new offices, closing of others and a redistribution ofauthorities.andM;Postal officials would not say whether the reorganizatin was caused by theagency's recent budget problems.andM;The Bush administration's budget request for the Postal Service is almostidentical to the one proposed by former President Reagan in his final budget.andO;Postal officials and members of Congress said the proposals, if approved,would lead to a 28 percent cut in the service's capital budget.andM;&quot;This is not a good budget proposal,&quot; said Rep.andP;  Mickey Leland (D-Texas),chairman of the House Post Office and Civil Service Subcommittee on PostalOperations and Services, during a recent hearing.andP;  &quot;In fact, there is nothingin this proposal that I like.&quot;andM;The agency, while moving forward on procurements to optical character readersand bar code equipment for its ZIP+4 program, is &quot;not yet at full steam inour capital modernization program, where the drastic budgetary cutbacks stillpinch hard,&quot; said Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank.andM;&quot;The administration budget recommends reducing fiscal 1990 Postal Servicecapital commitments by $823 million, which would be extremely detrimental tothe Postal Service's capital improvement program,&quot; said Rep.andP;  Frank McCloskey(D-Ind.), chairman of the Subcommittee on Postal Personnel and Modernization.andM;That program, which includes many of the agency's ADP modernization efforts,has been &quot;decimated&quot; by cuts during 1988 and 1989 that nearly wiped out postoffice automation plans, he saidandM;The two subcommittees met jointly during two days of hearings to considerways to improve the service's budget.andP;  One of their major concerns was arenewed effort on the part of Leland and many of his colleagues to remove thePostal Service from the federal budget.andM;McCloskey also said the administration's proposed budget is a guise forOffice of Management and Budget plans to contract out the work of the entirePostal Service.andM;&quot;I believe these proposals are part of a gradual plan to, piece by piece,privatize the Postal Service,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I and other members of the fullcommittee have repeatedly stated that we are opposed to privatization.andP;  Thisincludes privatization via the back door.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
