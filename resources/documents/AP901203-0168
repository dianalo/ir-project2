The conservative Christian Democrats defeated the left-leaningSocial Democrats in Sunday's city council race, just as they wonthe national German elections held the same day.   However, Christian Democrat leader Eberhard Diepgen, a formerWest Berlin mayor and the united city's new mayor-elect,immediately asked the Social Democrats to think about joining hisgovernment.   Both parties said Monday they would begin talks on puttingtogether a broad, left-to-right coalition for a city that iswithout a doubt the most politically polarized municipality inGermany.   ``What Berlin now needs is responsible government,'' said KlausLandowsky, general secretary of the Berlin Christian Democrats.   He called a merger with the Social Democrats ``mathematicallythinkable.''   Politically unthinkable, however, is forming a coalition withthe third-largest party - the former Communists who used to runEast Germany.   The Christian Democrats won 40.3 percent of the vote, the SocialDemocrats 30.5 percent and the former Communists, now called theParty for Democratic Socialism, finished with 9.2 percent.   Traditionally, if no party captures a majority, the first placefinisher would try to form a coalition with the third-place party.   Because of the stigma of East Germany's Communist past, however,no mainstream German party wants to form an alliance with theformer Communists at any level of government.   Sunday's election was the first time in 44 years that easternand western Berliners - once divided physically, ideologically andpsychologically by the Berlin Wall - could vote for the samegovernment.   Diepgen, a West Berliner, will be the mayor and have to puttogether a cabinet. He will answer to a 240-member legislature.   He will inherit a troubled city. Western Berlin is a modern,attractive metropolis faced with a housing crunch, a violentradical leftist fringe and serious overcrowding.   West Berlin always has been a state of perpetual bailout. Itspent much more than it took in annually because of huge subsidiesfrom the former West German government, which sought to keep afloatan island of democracy in a sea of Stalinism.   With Germany likely to face a cash crunch next year as the costof unification, some lawmakers may question whether Berlin shouldcontinue to get a disproportionate share of federal money.   Eastern Berlin, despite being the showplace of the formerCommunist nation, is beset with environmental problems, risingunemployment, bad roads and worse housing. It is also a strongholdof the former Communists.</TEXT></DOC>
