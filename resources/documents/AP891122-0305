Like other major U.S. automakers, GM has been seeking to cutcosts in an effort to meet intensifying competition while dealingwith an industrywide downturn and slowing national economy.   The nation's largest automaker had 103,410 salaried workers atthe end of last year, 21.8 percent less than its 132,279white-collar workers five years earlier, according to GM figures.   GM's hourly employment dropped 16.1 percent to 327,277 by theend of last year from 390,133 at the end of 1983.   On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported it had obtainedan internal GM document saying the company was looking intoreducing its salaried work force by about 5,000 people annuallyduring the next four or five years.   GM spokeswoman Patricia Malloy declined to confirm or deny thatsuch a study was going on or that such a memo existed.   However, she said: ``Are we looking at a head count? We continueto look at employment levels. As we head into the '90s, having theright number of people with the right skills who are adding valuethroughout the corporation is absolutely critical.''   Since 1987, General Motors has been involved in what it callsits ``Action Plan'' to cut costs throughout the corporation. In itsthird-quarter earnings report, GM said it had cut costs by $11billion and aimed to cut $12.5 billion to $13 billion by the end of1990.   The Journal said GM's top managers would meet Nov. 30 to reviewthe memo on cutting salaried jobs. Malloy said the managementcommittee meets monthly and that Nov. 30 is not a date for anyregularly scheduled meeting.   She declined to say when the next meeting would take place.   GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. each have cost-cuttingprograms under way, including cutbacks in the number ofwhite-collar workers.   Chrysler's plan to slash $1 billion from its budget by the endof next year, including an 8 percent reduction in its salaried workforce of about 28,000 employees, has attracted the most recentattention.   In 1983, Chrysler had about 26,500 salaried employees worldwide.By the end of last year, after Chrysler had acquired AmericanMotors Corp., the salaried work force had risen to just more than32,000.   Ford spokesman Tom Foote said the nation's No. 2 automaker hasreduced its U.S. salaried work force by about 30 percent during thelast decade, mainly during the early 1980s.</TEXT></DOC>
