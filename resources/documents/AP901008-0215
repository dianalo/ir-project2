The subsidiary was one of the few Western companies to weathermore than four decades of communism in Hungary. Now it is servingas IBM's model for expansion in the rest of Eastern Europe.   Perhaps the reason communist authorities allowed a little bit ofcapitalism to survive all those years is that it filled a vitalneed: It serviced IBM machines that were used to perform the censusand other record-keeping, said Eugen K. Hahn, managing director ofEastern European operations for International Business MachinesCorp.   ``We took care of the equipment, so we protected the investmentthe government made,'' he said in an interview at IBM's modernisticheadquarters building in a residential neighborhood.   IBM Hungary employs nearly 100 people, all Hungarians, to selland service the company's products.   Zsuzsa Branyik, who resigned as general manager of IBM Hungaryin April after about 20 years, recalled how the subsidiary managedto survive during the communist years even though it was limitedlargely to servicing equipment, not selling new machines.   At one point in the 1960s, even the service operation was shutdown and the engineers transferred to the state. But in the early1970s, the company was given back its employees and began toflourish.   ``It would be wonderful for me to work today - so many thingsare much, much easier,'' said Mrs. Branyik, the only female head ofa country organization IBM has ever had.   IBM has sales and service representatives throughout the formerEast bloc, but it wants to establish a greater presence in thesenations along the lines of IBM Hungry, Hahn said.   To increase its presence, IBM has donated computers touniversities in several Eastern European nations as part of what itcalls its academic initiative. In exchange, the universities areexpected to develop software and ties to local industry.   IBM also plans to tie these universities together in a computernetwork, and then link that network to the West - one of the firstsuch computer connections in the former East bloc, Hahn said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday, Oct. 14</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
