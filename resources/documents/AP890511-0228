Lynch, credited with uncovering WallStreet's insider trading scandal, says his resignation from theSecurities and Exchange Commission will not detract from theagency's fraud-fighting effort.   ``The enforcement program is a very strong program. ... It'sstaffed with super professionals. ... I don't think my departure isgoing to have much of an effect,'' said Lynch, who announcedWednesday that he will leave the SEC staff in mid-July.   A lanky, soft-spoken 38-year-old attorney, Lynch joined the SECin 1976, a year after graduating from Duke University Law School.He became the agency's youngest-ever enforcement director in early1985.   He steps down four years later amid a chorus of praise forplaying the central role in breaking open a series of insidertrading cases, beginning with the exposure of stockbroker DennisLevine, continuing through a $100 million settlement withspeculator Ivan Boesky and culminating four weeks ago with thesettlement of a massive civil fraud case with junk bond-giantDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the nation's fifth-largest securitiesfirm.   ``He's done extremely well, but the point is the agency willsurvive,'' said Stanley Sporkin, a former SEC enforcement chief,now a federal judge in Washington.   ``It's a resilient agency and there are no indispensable personsin life,'' said Sporkin, the man who hired Lynch.   Lynch took over the enforcement division at a time of turmoilfor the SEC and is credited with restoring morale damaged when hispredecessor, John Fedders, departed amid charges he had beaten hiswife.   Harvey Pitt, Boesky's attorney and a former SEC general counsel,said Lynch leaves behind four strong deputies, including AssociateDirector John H. Sturc, and all are capable of succeeding him.   ``I think the SEC's enforcement division is incredibly deep intalent,'' he said.   Although some securities lawyers say privately that Lynchhappened to be in the right place at the right time to lead thecrusade against Wall Street greed, Pitt and others say he wascrucial to the effort.   ``I think his contribution really cannot be overstated,'' Pittsaid. ``He has given direction and leadership to a program that ...really had not produced anywhere near the results he has nowproduced.''   Lynch is credited with personally piercing the veil of secrecysurrounding the Bahamas branch of a Swiss bank, where Dennis Levinemaintained an account.   It was three years ago this Friday that the SEC filed itscharges against Levine, whose cooperation led to Boesky, who inturn implicated Drexel Burnham in the largest securities fraud caseever brought by the government.   Drexel's agreement on the civil case brought by the SEC ispaving the way for it to pay a record $650 million in fines andrestitution to settle criminal charges.   Other prominent cases credited to Lynch include Martin A.Siegel, managing director of Drexel, who paid $9 million to settlecivil charges, and Boyd L. Jefferies, who was forced to resign ashead of the Los Angeles firm he founded.   The scandals uncovered during Lynch's tenure forced WallStreet's big brokerage houses to re-evaluate their compliance andethics codes and led Congress to increase the penalties for insidertrading.   As a government employee, Lynch worked 11-hour days andweekends, earning an annual salary of about $72,000, far less thanhe could earn in private practice. But neither the salary nor thelong hours played a major role in his decision to leave, he said.Lynch said he has made no specific plans for his future.   On Capitol Hill, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of theHouse Energy and Commerce Committee which oversees the SEC, and afrequent critic of the agency, said, ``He'll be missed. He's been agood public servant whose done a superb job of marshaling limitedresources.''   The SEC ``is losing a strikingly successful public servant,''said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the Energy andCommerce subcommittee on finance.</TEXT></DOC>
