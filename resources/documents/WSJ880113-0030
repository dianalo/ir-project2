Tokyo share prices rebounded in light trading during the afternoon session on persistent, but unsubstantiated rumors of an impending cut in Japan's official discount rate.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which fell 294.13 points Monday, gained 46.62 to close at 22625.05. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index rose 4.27 to 1799.42. First section volume was estimated at 500 million shares, up from 380 million shares Monday.    Traders said the rumors Tuesday of a possible discount rate cut, which most dismissed as unlikely, began late in the morning session and persisted throughout the afternoon, helping blue-chip issues to lead the market gradually higher.    One trader said that according to the rumors, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who left Tuesday for his first official visit to the U.S., might have to promise some type of action on interest rates if things go poorly in economic talks.    Foreign ministry sources, however, have indicated the prime minister wasn't likely to announce any major concessions in the U.S.    Traders also said food shares rose on speculation Mr. Takeshita would be forced to make consessions on opening the Japanese market to U.S. agricultural imports, which would allow the food companies to take better advantage of the relative cheapness of U.S. goods in yen terms at present exchange rates.    Ajinomoto ended up 40 yen to 3,130 ($24.35), while Kikkoman was up 30 to 1,120, Marudai Food rose 20 to 1,220, and Nippon Meat Packers was up 50 to 2,220.    In London, share prices closed at the day's worst level as a weak trend on Wall Street toward the end of the London day wiped out the market's early gains.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed off 20.5 at 1396.9. Volume was a modest 443 million shares, up slightly from 442.9 million shares a day earlier. The 100share index was off 21.0 at 1739.2 at the close.    Dealers said the market spent most of the day reacting to trends on Wall Street. Prices were helped during the morning by Monday's rise in New York, but drifted off during the afternoon when New York shares began to slide.    The market &quot;doesn't have any mind of its own,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;We've been tracking Wall Street all day.&quot;    The major shares were mixed at the close, with Glaxo Holdings up 7 pence at 980 pence ($18), Imperial Chemical Industries off 8 at #11.41 ($20.75), and BTR unchanged at 270.    The oil sector was hurt by weakness in crude oil prices after reports that Saudi Arabia is selling its oil at a discount to the official prices set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    British Petroleum was off 6 at 254, and Shell Transport andamp; Trading fell 20 to #10.25.    Britoil rose 7 to 453. Atlantic Richfield said Tuesday it increased its stake in Britoil to 23.04% with purchases of 550,000 Britoil shares.    Stocks in Frankfurt ended mixed in quiet trading.    Traders said that a number of market participants chose to step to the sidelines ahead of the Friday release of U.S. November trade figures.    Market sentiment seems divided on whether the report will show the trade deficit widening or narrowing. Either will affect the U.S. currency and earnings of dollar-sensitive West German industries. Traders said foreign investors were largely absent from the market, but those present were selling.    Quiet trading left many issues without much change. Among retailers, Karstadt led decliners with a 4.5-mark drop to end at 389 marks ($237), while Horten rose 2 to 157. In electrical issues, AEG eased 3 to 178, and Siemens firmed 1.3 to 351.3.    Schering led chemical stocks with a 9.2mark gain to 363, while BASF declined 1.3 to 242.2, and Bayer edged 0.3 mark lower to 256.6.    Other European markets closed generally higher. Stocks rose in Zurich, Brussels, Stockholm and Milan. Prices were mixed in Paris and Amsterdam. Dealers in most markets said activity was light as traders await the U.S. trade numbers.    In Asian markets, share prices closed higher in Singapore, Sydney, Taipei, Hong Kong, Wellington and Manila. Investors who had been worried about the possibility of another Black Monday were encouraged by Monday's recovery in New York. But activity was light in these markets as well as the coming trade figures held down volume.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                      % This                                   Jan 11    Jan 8    Year    U.S. ......................... 229.9     226.5   + 0.8    Britain ...................... 532.1     535.8   + 6.9    Canada ....................... 352.5     350.4   + 5.8    Japan ....................... 1059.9    1075.8   +12.2    France ....................... 288.8     297.1   -29.2    Germany ...................... 153.6     159.5   -40.9    Hong Kong ................... 1695.0    1736.8   - 4.7    Switzerland .................. 140.9     147.9   -29.8    Australia .................... 248.0     256.7   - 6.0    World index .................. 404.0     404.3   +13.2</TEXT></DOC>
