Guerrillas captured Svay Chek on Thursday morning and the peoplecame home in the afternoon, in a file of oxcarts loaded withchildren and belongings that stretched for well over a mile downthe road.   Villagers said more than 800 government soldiers were killed orwounded during the long battle. The guerrillas said they lost atleast 20 fighters and had more than 50 wounded.   The Khmer People's National Liberation Front drove the army fromthe town, opening the way for an attack on nearby Sisophon, wherethe Vietnam-sponsored Cambodian government has a militaryoperations center.   Field commanders said the guerrillas also seized six othernearby positions and pushed more than 10,000 soldiers back towardSisophon.   ``If I had known before there were that many, I wouldn't haveattacked,'' guerrilla Gen. Khun Roeng said of the defenders.   Retreating government troops pounded the area with artilleryfire all day Thursday. Guerrillas said 10 people were killed and 30wounded in one village south of Svay Chek.   It was the seventh insurgent attack on the town since lateSeptember, when Vietnam pulled its forces out of Cambodia aftermore than a decade of occupation.   ``This is the most important victory in the 10 years we havebeen fighting the Vietnamese and their puppet government,'' saidGen. Sak Sutsakarn, the guerrilla commander for the area.   Hours after their victory, more than 1,000 rebels moved intotrenches the government forces had dug around the town. They foundthe bodies of soldiers in the trenches.   Rebel commanders assaulted Svay Chek from three directionsThursday. They celebrated victory with whiskey and their men firedthousands of bursts of gunfire in the air.   Some guerrillas searched government buildings for souvenirs.Many wore hats, pins and scarves they said came from the bodies ofgovernment soldiers.   More than 1,000 weapons, mortars and artillary pieces werecaptured, along with 4,000 cases of ammunition, two tanks, fourheavy trucks and an armored personnel carrier.   Army defectors, still in uniform and armed, mingled with theguerrillas. Wounded government soldiers were taken to medicalstations in the jungle.   ``How many of you are left hiding in the forest?'' a guerrillaasked one of the wounded, who replied: ``They are all gone. Theyall fled.''   Sak appealed to the world to provide food and medicine to themore than 50,000 civilians he said are in guerrilla-controlledareas of Cambodia.   ``We want peace,'' he said, ``but to reach peace we have tocombine military and political action. The political action hasfailed in Paris and until it succeeds, the war will continue.''   An alliance of two non-Communist guerrilla groups and the KhmerRouge, a Communist fighting force that is by far the strongest, isfighting the government of Premier Hun Sen.   Talks on a negotiated settlement and a possible U.N. transitionrole were held in Paris earlier this year, but ended withoutagreement.   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and overthrew thebrutal Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot, which took over the countryafter the Indochina war ended in April 1975 and was blamed for morethan 1 million deaths.</TEXT></DOC>
