That proposal provided, in part, that the assets of a planinclude any property that constitutes employee contributions to the plan.In the preamble to that proposal, the Department indicated that in thecase of payroll deductions, an employee contribution is made at the timepayment by check or cash is made or is required to be made to an employeein an amount less than that to which he would otherwise have been entitled,the lesser amount being justified on the ground that a contribution isbeing made to a plan.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Secretary of Labor has authority to issue regulationsrelating to section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code pursuant to section102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978).For the sake of clarity, the remainder of the preamble refers only to TitleI of ERISA. However, these references apply to the corresponding provisionsof section 4975 of the Code as well.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 44 FR at 50365, n.12.The portion of the 1979 Proposal that dealt with the trust requirementof ERISA also contained a proposed exemption from that requirement underwhich sponsoring employers of welfare plans would have been permitted toretain employee contributions for up to 90 days, provided they satisfiedcertain conditions with respect to such contributions.A portion of the 1979 Proposal was reproposed in 1980 (45 FR 38084, June6, 1980).In 1982, the Department issued a final regulation dealing with a portionof the plan assets proposal as well as a regulation dealing with the trustrequirement (47 FR 21241, May 18, 1982). In the preamble to that regulation,the Department noted that it intended to deal at another time with theissues raised by the comments on the proposed exemption from the trustrequirement together with the part of the plan assets proposal regardingemployee contributions.On January 8, 1985, the Department withdrew most of the provisions of the1979 Proposal and published a new proposal dealing with the definitionof ``plan assets'' (50 FR 961). However, the Department did not withdrawthe portion of the 1979 proposal dealing with employee contributions, and,in the preamble accompanying the new proposal, the Department noted thatit intended to address these issues separately. Thus, this document containsthe final rule relating to participant contributions based on the recorddevelped with respect to the 1979 Proposal.As noted above, the 1979 Proposal contained a proposed exemption from thetrust requirement for certain employee contributions to certain welfarebenefit plans. Several comments were received on this aspect of the proposal;these commentators generally argued that participant contributions to suchplans represented reimbursement for costs already incurred by the employerand that such amounts should thus not be characterized as plan assets.In particular, one employer commented that it paid approximately 85% ofbenefits under its welfare plan from its own assets and that only 15% ofthe amounts paid out in benefits were attributable to participant contributions.In this regard, the Department would consider the appropriateness of anexemption from the trust requirement for certain welfare plans which couldshow that employee contributions consistently constituted reimbursementto the employer for moneys expended in premium payments or benefits.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Final Regulation</ITAG>(1) General Rule for Participant ContributionsIn response to the proposed regulation, the Department received numerouscomments objecting to the requirement that employee contributions be paidinto trust at the time such amounts are deducted from the employees' pay.Some of the commentators represented that large companies with severalpayrolls and payroll locations could not accomplish the necessary accountingand fund transfer operations to place employee contributions in trust immediatelywithout substantial costs and disruption to existing payroll systems. Othercommentators argued that the proposed rule would impose increased costsand administrative burdens, especially on small employers; in this regard,one commentator stressed that the regulations should not operate so asto discourage contributory plans, as that may be the only kind of planan employer can afford to sponsor.Comments from the banking and insurance industries addressed situationswhere a plan is funded by insurance contracts with premiums payable monthlyor quarterly, and where a plan is maintained in connection with a trustagreement which can only accept monthly or quarterly contributions. Thesecommentators argued that the funding vehicle could not accept contributionsmore frequently without significant costs. In addition, the commentatorsindicated that the maintenance of an interim trust would create administrativeexpenses without concomitant benefits to participants.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Persons commenting on the proposed exemption from thetrust requirement raised similar objections to the condition in that exemptionwhich would have required that employee contributions be held in a segregatedaccount.Finally, several commentators noted that the proposed 90 day trust exemptionfor certain welfare plans contrasted sharply with the rule for other typesof plans, for which the exemption would not be available.After consideration of the comments, the Department has decided to modifythe rule relating to participant contributions. Under the final regulation,the assets of a plan shall include amounts paid by a participant (or beneficiary)or withheld by an employer from a participant's wages for contributionto a plan as of the earliest date on which such contributions can reasonablybe segregated from the employer's general assets, but in any event within90 days from the date on which such amounts are received by the employeror would otherwise have been payable to the employee in cash. Under thisrevised general rule, participant contributions to both pension plans andwelfare plans are treated alike.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ One employer sponsoring a contributory plan commentedthat retired persons participated in its welfare benefit plan and requestedclarification as to the treatment of amounts received from such persons.Section 3(7) of ERISA defines the term ``participant'' to mean ``any employeeor former employee of an employer * * * who is or may become eligible toreceive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan.'' In addition,the continuation coverage provisions of Part 6 of title I of ERISA requirethat group health plans provide certain employees, former employees (includingretirees), and family members the opportunity to continue health care coverageunder the plan at group rates in certain instances where coverage wouldotherwise be terminated. See sections 601 through 608 of ERISA. Thus, thestatute clearly contemplates that former employees, retirees and certainbeneficiaries may be covered by a plan, in addition to active employees.Accordingly, while the final regulation refers to ``participant contributions'',the regulation also applies to payments made by former employees, retirees,and family member-beneficiaries covered under the plan. The revised general rule relating to participant contributions is intendedto reflect a balancing of the costs of promptly transmitting such contributionsto the plan relative to the protections provided to participants by suchtransfers. In formulating the final regulation, the Department has attemptedto remain consistent with one of the key purposes of the trust requirementof section 403(a) of ERISA_the segregation of plan assets so as to preventcommingling of such assets with an employer's own property.The regulation is not intended, however, to allow employers to use participantcontributions for their own purposes. The Department is concerned thatparticipant contributions be paid promptly into the plan so as to beginearning interest or other investment return and to be available for thepayment of benefits. Employers should examine their current payroll proceduresto ascertain whether they are indeed transmitting participant contributionamounts at the earliest reasonable time. In this regard, employers whofail to transmit promptly such amounts, and plan fiduciaries who fail tocollect those amounts in a timely manner, will violate the requirementthat plan assets be held in trust; in addition, such employers and fiduciariesmay be engaging in prohibited transactions. <T3>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</T3> v. <T3>Solmsen</T3>, 671 F. Supp. 938 (E.D.N.Y. 1987).\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The obligation of a plan fiduciary to collect participantcontributions from an employer is similar to the obligation of a fiduciaryto collect contributions payable by an employer on its own behalf. In thisrespect, the Department has indicated that if a multiple employer plandoes not establish and implement collection procedures which are reasonable,diligent and systematic, it may be found to be engaging in prohibited transactionsunder ERISA for failing to collect delinquent contributions. <T3>See</T3> ERISA section 406(a)(1)(B) and Prohibited Transaction Exemption76-1, 41 FR 12740, 12741, March 26, 1976. <T3>Cf., Central States Pension Fund </T3>v. <T3>Central Transport, Inc.,</T3> 472 U.S. 559, 574 (1985), where the Courtinterpreted section 406(a)(1)(B) of ERISA as creating a requirement thatthe plan trustee assure the full and prompt collection of all contributionsowed to the plan.The final rule allows a maximum of 90 days for employers to pay to theplan amounts representing participant contributions. The 90 day periodis to begin on the date on which the contribution amount is received bythe employer or the date on which such amounts would have otherwise beenpayable to the employee in cash. While the majority of commentators requestedthe Department adopt a final rule allowing for quarterly payments of participantcontributions to a plan, many employers represented that they currentlyremitted such contributions on a biweekly or a monthly basis. The Departmentwishes to stress that the outside limit of 90 days is not intended to supersedethe preceding portion of the rule, that is, that participant contributionsbecome plan assets ``as of the earliest date on which such contributionscan reasonably be segregated from the employer's general assets.'' Whatis a reasonable time for segregation from the employer's general assetsdepends on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The Department is of the opinion that there will be circumstanceswhere the date of receipt of a participant contribution paid to the employerwill be the earliest date on which such a contribution could reasonablybe segregated from the employer's general assets and, therefore, in suchcircumstances, such an amount will be immediately subject to the trustrequirement.It will not be reasonable if, absent changed circumstances, an employerwhich has been making biweekly remittances of such contributions hereafterchanges its practices to hold such amounts in its own account for an additionalperiod of time, up to the 90 day limit. It will also not be reasonablefor an employer which has been, and is able to continue, making monthlyremittances to delay such remittances for an additional 60 days in orderto take advantage of the 90 day maximum. Similarly, an employer which hasbeen making remittances of participant contributions to the plan at orwithin 90 days, but which is reasonably able to remit such amounts at anearlier time, must change its practices to comply with the rule promulgatedtoday.(2) Relationship to 18 U.S.C. 664The Department of Justice, in its comments on the proposed regulation,stated that under 18 U.S.C. 664, the embezzlement, conversion, abstraction,or stealing of ``any of the moneys, funds, securities, premiums, credits,property, or other assets of any employee welfare benefit plan or employeepension benefit plan, or any fund connected therewith,'' is a criminaloffense, and that under such language, criminal prosecution may go forwardin situations in which the participant contribution is not a plan assetfor purposes of Title I of ERISA. Though this regulation defines when participantcontributions become ``plan assets,'' it does so only for the purposesof Title I of ERISA and the related prohibited transaction excise tax provisionsof the Code. The regulation explicitly states that it may not be reliedupon to bar criminal prosecutions pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 664.However, it should be noted that under this regulation in circumstancesin which the employer clearly converts participant contributions to hisown use, such amounts will be considered ``segregated,'' and thus willbe ``plan assets.''(3) Dues-Financed PlansSeveral commentators expressed concern that the term ``participant contributions''might be interpreted to include amounts paid as union dues when a portionof such dues may be used to pay benefits under a dues-financed welfareor pension plan. If such payments are considered to be participant contributions,one commentator argued, the sponsoring employee organization would be requiredto incur needless additional expenses. This commentator noted that undersection 501(a) of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of1959, officers, agents, shop stewards and other representatives of labororganizations sponsoring plans are declared trustees with respect to suchamounts and that criminal penalties are provided for the breach of dutyby any such trustee.The Department does not intend for the regulation relating to participantcontributions to include amounts paid to an employee organization as uniondues. Union dues are generally considered to be income to the union and,like other assets of the union, may be subject to the claims of the union'sgeneral creditors or used for the organization's general purposes. TheDepartment has concluded that amounts paid as union dues should not becharacterized as participant contributions merely because a portion ofsuch dues might be used to provide benefits under a welfare or pensionplan sponsored by the employee organization.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ In some circumstances a union may so specifically ``earmark''a portion of such dues as a source of benefits under a plan that thosemonies should be considered plan assets. This issue is beyond the scopeof the regulation being published here.(4) Effective DateThe Department is establishing an effective date for this final rule of90 days from the date of its publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in order to allow employers to adjust their accountingprocedures and payroll systems to comply with the new rule. During this90 day period, as noted above, all affected employers should examine theircurrent payroll practices to determine whether they are in compliance withtoday's rule, that is, whether they are transmitting participant contributionamounts to the plan at the earliest date such contributions can reasonablybe segregated from the employer's assets, not to exceed 90 days from thedate of payment to or withholding by the employer.(5) DesignationThis final rule is being published at 29 CFR 2510.3-102.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Department has determined that this regulation would not have a significanteconomic impact on small plans or other small entities. The regulationwould describe when contributions made by a participant of a plan subjectto ERISA or to the related prohibited transaction excise tax provisionsof the Internal Revenue Code must be transmitted to the plan by an employerwithholding the contributions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Department has determined that the regulatory action would not constitutea ``major rule'' as that term is used in Executive Order 12291 becausethe action would not result in: an annual effect on the economy of $100million; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, government agencies, or geographical regions; or significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment productivity, innovation,or the ability of United States based enterprises to compete with foreignbased enterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The regulation being issued here is not subject to the requirements ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) because it does not contain an ``information collectionrequest'' as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(11).<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Authority</ITAG>The final regulation is being adopted pursuant to the authority containedin section 505 of ERISA (Pub.
