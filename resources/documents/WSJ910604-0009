The new machine, which costs about $6,000, is stillexperimental and has been tested only on a handful ofpatients. In an initial report on human trials with it atBoston's Massachusetts General Hospital, researchers said themachine worked successfully on 14 of 16 patients with kidneystones. The results were scheduled for presentation yesterdayat a urology meeting in Toronto.</LP><TEXT>   Kidney stones, which afflict about 350,000 Americansannually, mainly middle-aged men, are painful calciumcrystals that often lodge in the kidneys or in the ureters,ducts that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.Currently, the stones typically are removed by lithotripters,million-dollar machines that focus shock waves from outsidethe body to pulverize stones. Laser systems costing about$240,000, which break up stones with pulses of laser lightconducted through optical fibers, are sometimes used,especially on ureter stones.   The new machine, called an electromechanical impactor,works like a tiny jackhammer, said Stephen Dretler, aurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who helped todevelop and is testing the machine. The machine employs aspring enclosed in a large, needle-like device, which issnaked into the urinary tract via a tube until it is next toa stone. An electrical spark causes a small explosion withinthe device, repeatedly thrusting a metal head on one end ofthe spring against the stone until it breaks up.   The device was developed by researchers at the hospitaland Physical Sciences Inc., a closely held technicalconsulting firm in Andover, Mass. Physical Sciences hasformed a unit to develop the machine and seek Food and DrugAdministration approval to market it, said a spokesman forthe firm.   In the first round of tests on the 16 patients with kidneystones, the device failed in two cases in which the stoneswere too hard to break, said Dr. Dretler. The tests alsoindicated the machine is very safe, he added. It &quot;doesn'tinjure tissue&quot; because its force is confined and directedonly at the stones, he explained.   The machine initially is aimed at use in small hospitalsfor treating stones lodged in the ureter, which cause abouthalf of kidney-stone cases. The machine also may provepopular in the Third World, where lithotripters are rare,said Dr. Dretler. &quot;If you have a lithotripter, you probablywould use it on kidney stones&quot; rather than the new device, headded, because lithotripters don't require insertion of atube into the urinary tract. Moreover, the laser blasters, ifavailable, may be preferable to the new device because theyrequire insertion of a smaller tube into the urinary tractthan the new machine does, he said.   But improved versions of the new device eventually maycompete directly with lithotripters, made by DornierMedizintechnick G.m.b.H. of Germany and other companies, andwith laser systems made by Candela Laser Corp., Natick, Mass.&quot;I think we'll be able to use the device {to pulverize} smallstones up in the kidney,&quot; thus providing a cheaperalternative to lithotripters in many cases, said Dr. Dretler.   Moreover, the new device's safety and ease of use mayenable doctors to treat kidney stones without givinganesthesia and without having to insert additionalinstruments now used with laser devices to peer at stoneswhile destroying them, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
