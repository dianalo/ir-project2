The change Goldin wrote in a proposed code revision, unanimouslyendorsed by the Bar Association of San Francisco's directors, woulddefine marriage as a ``personal relation arising out of a civilcontract between two people.''   Under the law now, it's between ``a man and a woman.''   The change would have let Larry Brinkin take a three-day leaveafter the death of his lover of 11 years. His employer wouldn't lethim off, though a co-worker got time off for the death of astepmother he had never met.   It would have made it easier for Donna Hitchens and her partnerto adopt. Hitchens, an attorney, had to become the child's guardian,leaving her partner with no legal parental authority until theysuccessfully challenged the law; ultimately, they legally adoptedtwo children.   It also would force hospitals to allow a gay AIDS patient's loverinto intensive care. Many only let in relatives.   Gay couples live in a ``limbo-like state outside of the law,''said Peter Keane, president of the local association. ``It's apariah-type class that's set up within the law. To me, it's anunfairness issue.''   Redefining marriage to include homosexuals would grant all therights, privileges _ and burdens _ of marriage to gay couples. Amongthe areas affected if the proposal is made into law are taxexemptions, inheritance laws, pensions and health plans, as well asparenting privileges and adoption rights.   ``We're not for it,'' said Deacon Norman D. Phillips, spokesmanfor Catholic Archbishop John Quinn. ``To us, marriage is a sacramentwith deeply religious overtones. Our church believes marriage canonly be entered into by a male and a female.'' Quinn believes someinequities may warrant compensation, but calls for use of contracts``that don't establish a quasi-marriage.''   The resolution must survive two local reviews to be considered bythe State Bar Conference of Delegates in September, when about 500representatives of the state's 117,000 lawyers will consider andpropose new laws and and plan repeal efforts. If it passes, Barlobbyists will seek a legislative sponsor.   The specification of ``a man and a woman'' became law in 1977after a spate of gay marriages, which weren't prohibited then. Underthe amendment signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, homosexuals have littlesay regarding partners' medical care and cannot share insurancecoverage or health benefits.   In West Hollywood, the first U.S. city governed by a majority ofgay city officials, unmarried city employees may add their partnersto health benefit and pension plans. Berkeley and Santa Cruz offersimilar benefits.   In San Francisco, where an estimated 10 percent of residents aregay, Board of Supervisors President Harry Britt, the panel's onlygay member, has spent years trying to provide sweeping rights to``alternative families.''   Goldin, who is not gay, is a member of the bar association. Shesaid her proposal also would include child custody, communityproperty and spousal support obligations.   Supporters don't anticipate throngs of gay couples flocking tothe altar, but they insist that everyone should have the opportunity_ and equal rights.   Auto insurance companies that offer family reductions excludehomosexuals and unmarried heterosexual couples, and income tax lawsfavor married couples in some ways, according to Karen Strauss ofthe Lesbian Rights Project.   ``So long as benefits are given or taken away based onrelationship status, then we want access to them as well,'' saidCynthia Goldstein, an attorney with National Gay Rights Advocates.   Like many lesbians, Hitchens says she would marry if she could.After 12 years with her partner and two adopted children, she saideconomics _ not emotion _ would prompt her to tie the legal knot.   Brinkin, who lost a court battle against his employer overbereavement leave for the death of Richard Reich, isn't sure whetherhe would marry. ``My commitment comes from my heart and I don't needa piece of paper to do that.''   Advocates of the change say the issue is purely a question oflaw, that the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of theConstitution prohibits discrimination against classes of people andshould cover homosexuals.   ``My guess is that the debate is going to be much moresociological than legal,'' said Colin Wied, president of the StateBar. ``Society would recoil at this idea. My guess is that lawyerswill follow suit.''</TEXT></DOC>
