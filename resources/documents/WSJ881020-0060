But in a report released by the group here yesterday, other measures also were strongly endorsed to keep the current boom in steel going and to prevent the next downturn from being as severe as the last one, when oversupply and other factors saddled U.S. steelmakers with $12 billion in losses over a four-year period.    The quotas are &quot;just one piece of the puzzle,&quot; said Lewis B. Kaden, chairman of the commission. &quot;Although progress has been made, there is more work to be done.&quot;    The commission is comprised of leaders from business, labor, education and government. Created in 1981 by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, its job is to advise the state and the nation on trade policy. The steel report is the first in a series of five industry-specific studies to be released by the group. The others will center on financial services, telecommunications, apparel and food processing.    The thrust of yesterday's report is that government, labor and industry must work in concert to ensure steel's survival. For instance, Lynn Williams, president of the United Steelworkers union and a commission member, cited the need for continued capital spending by U.S. steel companies, and praised the industry for investing annually an estimated $3 billion in new equipment over the past decade. The result, he said, is higher quality steel goods that can better compete globally.    Mr. Williams and others also asserted that much of the industry's recovery has hinged on increased productivity by the nation's steelworkers. And they called for more of the same. &quot;We have to be hard on ourselves so we can be tough on the rest of the world,&quot; said Eugene J. Keilin, another commission member and a general partner in the investment banking firm of Lazard Freres andamp; Co.    Indeed, being tough on the rest of the world is a theme that runs through the report. It calls, for example, on the next presidential administration to persuade U.S. trading partners to stop unfair labor practices, which the commission contended give them a price advantage here. They also called for more markets to be opened overseas.    The group also unhesitatingly supported an extension of VRAs, or voluntary restraint agreements, which limit the amount of steel that foreigners can export to the U.S. Critics contend that the program, which expires in September 1989, is too protectionist and has caused large shortages of metal for end-users. </TEXT></DOC>
