The U.S. Court of Appeals here rejected arguments by the Food and Drug Administration and the cosmetics industry that the risk of cancer to humans from the dyes is so small that a strict interpretation of the law banning carcinogenic additives is unreasonable. The court said the provision, known as the Delaney Clause, is rigid and denies &quot;FDA authority to list (approve) a dye once it found it to 'induce cancer in. . . animals.'&quot;    FDA approval of two dyes, Orange No. 17 and Red No. 19, both used in cosmetics, was knocked down by the decision.    William Schultz, a lawyer with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, which filed the suit against the dye approval, said the court &quot;handed consumers an important victory.&quot; He called the decision the &quot;most important food and drug case to be decided in many years.&quot;    The FDA didn't have any comment on the decision. A spokeswoman for the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, an industry group that fought for the dyes in court, said the decision was &quot;disappointing, but this is not the end.&quot; She noted that another appeals court is considering a similar case involving other dyes.    Judicial, legislative and even internal administration battles over the color additives have been waged for years as the FDA permitted several dyes to remain on the market with tentative approval, while the agency repeatedly delayed a final decision.    Internal FDA documents showed that agency officials recommended banning carcinogenic colors. A January 1985 legal memorandum by the Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress, called continued use of the additives &quot;legally untenable.&quot; Six months later a House subcommittee said the administration was in &quot;clear violation&quot; of the law by not rejecting the dyes.    In August 1986, however, the FDA announced final approval of the two dyes despite laboratory findings that the colors cause cancer when ingested by animals. An FDA document written at the time said the agency concluded that the &quot;cancer risk is so trivial as to pose no risk at all.&quot;    But the three-judge appeals court panel, in an opinion by Judge Stephen Williams, said &quot;the natural -- almost inescapable --&quot; reading of the law &quot;is that if the secretary (of Health and Human Services) finds the additive to 'induce' cancer in animals, he must deny listing.&quot;    The court said it concluded &quot;with some reluctance&quot; that the law lacks exceptions. If the law has led to unintended consequences, the FDA should seek to have it changed, the opinion said. &quot;That moment may well have arrived,&quot; the court said, &quot;but we cannot provide the desired escape.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
