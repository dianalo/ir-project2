The five-year dry spell is forcing unpleasantcutbacks in personal water use, ruinous deprivation oflandscaping, drastic reordering of some business routines anddraconian curtailment of agriculture. Yet national policy --and thereafter the country -- may emerge the better for it.   We don't say that out of any ache for sacrifice orhostility to viable development of natural resources. What'sencouraging is that the drought has stirred up a debate thatis challenging convention. Water is coming to be regarded asa commodity, perhaps the most precious of any. All the morereason its best uses ought to be found through themarketplace.</LP><TEXT>   Now, politicians are joining resource economists inobserving the perversities in water policy: mistaking averagefor marginal costs, ignoring opportunity costs, insisting oncurrent usage as a basis for future draws (&quot;use it or loseit&quot;). The results are the overbuilding of projects,overemphasis on agriculture and underuse of conservation.   The politics of water traditionally has been a tangle.Fostering federal subsidies via Bureau of Reclamationirrigation projects has been a bipartisan enterprise. Itbegan under Teddy Roosevelt, of course, and blossomed withFDR, but the bureau's reach was still being doubled between1945 and 1965. Subsidy levels can approach 90%. The excessswelled because of Republicans' reflexive alliance withcorporate agriculture, solidified by the seeming resistanceof the environmental left to anything that puts &quot;big&quot; and&quot;business&quot; in the same barnyard. Conversely, Rep. GeorgeMiller, a blustery Democrat from the San Francisco Bay areaand the key House member on water policy, may play a role incurbing the glut.   Mr. Miller, as he displayed while chairing a hearing onthe drought this week, is a committed foe of the ReclamationBureau. But he's made a special cause of cutting off thesubsidies to farms that exceed acreage limits foreligibility. Last year his insistence on ridding the programof such alleged abuses as family trusts resulted in thedemise of a grab-bag bill that included some small stepstoward a water market.   His opponent in that standoff was then-Senator PeteWilson. Yet Mr. Miller on Tuesday praised Mr. Wilson'sresponse to the drought as Governor. The Republican has actedto redirect water away from agriculture and to permit whatamounts to temporary condemnation of farmlands to spare thewater that would go to plantings. This is not trivial: Thealfalfa crop alone uses as much water as half the urban usersin the state.   Nobody sane wants to see California's $18 billion-a-yearagricultural industry decimated. The drought is compoundingearlier ill effects of a freeze, adding to layoffs in a statealready succumbing to recession. Yet crops that requiresaturation watering -- seemingly so inappropriate toCalifornia's dry Central Valley, particularly when some ofthese crops are in surplus nationally -- are a soggyfoundation for prosperity.   California water policy has been seeking a new directionsince the 1982 referendum defeat of the Peripheral Canal, anextension of the State Water Project (a less baleful but alsomammoth version of the Bureau of Reclamation). Resource usehas already been coming under more careful scrutiny. If Mr.Miller can see past his obsession with keeping farms under960 acres, and if Mr. Wilson will permit his ag constituencyto adjust to a real market for inputs, the two erstwhileantagonists may help steer this flux into a transformedpolicy that spreads throughout the West.   California shouldn't be the most difficult step. TheCentral Valley, in fact, is one of the least subsidized, perirrigated acre, of the giant federal projects. However, itsymbolizes what is wrong and what is possible. By its natureand its history, water defies easy assignment of propertyrights. But technology can be the ally of will.   The process can be gradual, perhaps starting with a cedingof federal power to the states (Mr. Miller sounds agreeable).It would also require a devolution of rights from irrigationdistricts -- currently the actual holders -- to water users(who are more prone to sell), and a grandfathering of someclaims to recognize the capitalized land values of expectedsubsidy.   For those who worry that water uses such as publicrecreation and fisheries would be left out of the bidding,all it takes is an appropriation from a legislative body toensure a place at the table. Governor Wilson already has sucha stratagem in mind.   Markets mean change, however, and we'd better anticipatethe resistance. Once water rights are traded and communitiesare altered, we can expect to hear the mournful strains ofsocial dislocation from the sentimental statists. BothArizona and the Denver area, experimenting with the purchaseof &quot;water farms&quot; for sake of their sustenance, provide apreview of this. California has its Owens Valley experience,tainted though it was with deceit.   Still, in California's political climate the stress ofsevere drought may be enough to overcome one of the iron lawsof political economy -- that the many, with a small stake,are no match for the few with a large one. What's needed is aturn to market allocations. And what's important is that itstart, rather than have this drought merely yield a new setof administrative regulations that bestow new prizes.</TEXT></DOC>
