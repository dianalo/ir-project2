McDonnell Douglas said the contract has a value of about $100 million.    McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. said it will launch two satellites, one in 1988 and the other in 1989, using commercial versions of its Delta rocket. The rockets will launch satellites built by Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., for British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd., a London-based consortium. The satellites will establish a direct satellite-to-home broadcast system in Europe, said the McDonnell Douglas unit.    Having the first firm contract would give St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas the early lead in the race by the three large aerospace companies competing for private launches. General Dynamics Corp., St. Louis, and Martin Marietta Corp, Bethesda, Md., are the other competitors.    A General Dynamics spokesman said that company has reservations but no definitive contracts for satellite launches. A Martin Marietta spokesman said his company has reservations with seven organizations to launch more than seven satellites and has also sent out contract proposals. He couldn't say, however, if any of those proposals had resulted in a solid contract.    The McDonnell contract is a direct result of President Reagan's decision last summer to ban commercial payloads, in favor of defense and scientific missions, from the space-shuttle program following the Challenger explosion.    McDonnell also said commercial launching to date has been delayed by the inability to secure third-party liability insurance coverage for such launches. McDonnell solved this problem by agreeing to indemnify Hughes and the British consortium, an action reflected in the contract costs.    David J. Smith, an analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc., Baltimore, said the competition among the three companies isn't exactly head-to-head because the three have different payload capabilities. McDonnell's Delta rocket is geared to handle the lowest-weight satellite payload of 4,000 pounds, while Martin Marietta has a payload capability of 12,500 pounds. General Dynamics's Atlas-Centaur launch vehicles can boost 5,200-pound payloads into orbit. </TEXT></DOC>
