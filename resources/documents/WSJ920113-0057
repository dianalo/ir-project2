Company programsthat focus solely on the need to crack down on fraud have thepotential to exacerbate the problems by destroying trust andrespect in the work force. Even excluding fraud, managing thecosts of workers' comp can no longer be delegated down theline.   The tab for workers' compensation at U.S. businesses in1990 was $60 billion, up from just $23 billion in 1982. Ofcourse, this is still a far cry from the more than $200billion in health-care costs funded directly by employers.But workers' compensation costs are growing even more quicklythan regular health-care costs. And unlike regularhealth-care costs, every employer is required to pick up thetab (over $500 per employee).</LP><TEXT>   Three major changes occurred in workers' compensation inthe 1980s that transformed a sleepy, legislated no-faultbenefit program into the volatile cost component it is today.First, programs to control health-care costs for injuries andillnesses outside the workplace -- e.g., deductibles,copayments, HMOs, PPOs, utilization review -- had thepernicious effect of chasing these medical costs into theworkers' compensation arena, where every medical dollar iscovered in most states. Thus, even if your company hasinstituted tough medical-cost controls in its employeebenefit programs, you may well find the cost savings offsetby steep increases in workers' compensation costs.   Second, the original no-fault intent of workers'compensation laws has given way to judicial interpretationsthat have produced a system up to its neck in litigation. InCalifornia, for example, 44% of workers' compensation casesinvolving lost time end up attached to a lawsuit; and manystart out as a lawsuit. This has occurred for a variety ofreasons, the most important of which is the increasedwillingness of the courts to entertain these suits.   Third, the nature of workplace injuries and illnesses isshifting dramatically, with an increasing incidence of morecomplicated back injuries and the emergence of so-calledcumulative trauma injuries, such as those associated withrepetitive work with video display terminals. The latest inthis cumulative trauma category is the development ofpsychological and mental stress claims, in which lawyers andcourts are struggling mightily -- to the greater cost toeveryone -- to define what constitutes a valid claim.   In granting rate increases to workers' compensationinsurers, state regulators frequently ignore these underlyingcost trends. The result is not surprising: inadequate ratestructures in the private market, a decrease in the amount ofinsurance that private carriers can issue, and an increase inthe role of-and cost of-state government in administeringworkers' compensation.   Most companies are not set up to react to, let alonemanage, the problem. As with health costs and the employeebenefits manager, risk managers in these companies lack theclout to persuade line managers to make changes. That's whysenior management teams today need to:   -- Get the facts. What are your workers' compensationtrends over time? Measuring workers' compensation trends forthe past five years relative to sales, profits, number ofemployees, and salaries represents a good starting point. APennsylvania manufacturer discovered its workers'compensation costs had more than doubled in the past fiveyears, and the increase alone chewed up 25% of net income.   -- Understand your current programs. Start discussionswith your risk management department for a clear view of thecompany's current management of illnesses, accidents and theprevention of both. One manufacturer discovered his companyhad installed adequate safety training programs, but that ithad virtually no procedures in place to ensure a caringresponse to injured workers after the accident. As a result,workers stayed away from work more than twice as long as wasappropriate. Unfortunately, most risk management departmentstoday only scratch the surface, because they are not yetsophisticated about medical-cost management and because theydo not have the clout to make changes in the organization.   -- Meet with outside vendors. Many vendors, particularlyinsurance carriers, are developing innovative services andproducts to control workers' compensation costs. Yet, theseservices frequently stress changes that require the supportand endorsement of the most important line managers in yourcompany. For example, rehabilitation programs offered byoutside specialists often require that injured workers backon the job be reassigned to new, less stressful positions;the design of these positions can be accomplished only byfront-line managers. For this reason alone, you need to hearfirst-hand what these vendors have to offer and decide whichideas should be introduced to line management.   -- Build a cost-containment program that involves linemanagement, your vendors and medical providers. The state ofOregon mandated that all companies with 10 or more employeesform committees to address the workers' compensation problemin their own organizations. The result: Alone among thestates, workers' compensation costs have decreased each ofthe past two years in Oregon.   A program to reduce the frequency and severity of workers'compensation claims in your company will be influenced by itsculture, structure and politics. Forging this partnership isa difficult task in which CEOs and chief financial officersmust take the lead.   -- Measure the impact. Measurements must be devised totrack both the frequency and the severity of injuries, withspecific costs accredited to both. After expenses arequantified -- in terms of days lost, hospital costs, etc. --the last step would be to estimate the financial benefit ofimplementing the new programs. Failure to specify themeasurement system upfront may result in after-the-facttracking that is biased.   -- Play a more active and visible role in workers'compensation reform in the states where your employees work.Insurers have sought reforms at the state level, but theirclout is limited without the active involvement of employercoalitions.   Perhaps the most important partnership that must beestablished or reaffirmed is the one with your employees.Making them a part of a program to control costs isessential. The good news is that the impact of awell-orchestrated, integrated workers' compensationcost-containment program can be substantial, leading todeclines in workers' compensation costs where previously onlydouble-digit year-to-year increases reigned. Workers'compensation costs will be controlled when employers workharder to establish strong bonds with employees as well asstrong safety and rehabilitation programs.   ---   Mr. Pritula is a partner in the New York office ofMcKinsey andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
