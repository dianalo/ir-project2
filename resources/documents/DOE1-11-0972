(1) According to the research madewith a bench-scale heat-accumulating tank (with 10 Mcal scale) whichwas trially made in 1984, Lm-Ni alloy (Lm: a mixed metal containing muchLa) for a heat-accumulating tank and La-Nd-Ni alloy for a hydrogen-absorbingalloy were selected. (2) Heat-accumulating tank could be accurately simulatedfrom the three characteristics of a) overall heat transfer coefficientbetween the reacting alloy and the heat medium, b) heat capacity of thetank, and c) overall heat transfer coefficient of heat loss. A favorableresult was obtained for an attached heat pump when a mixture of hydrogen-absorbingalloy and aluminum fibre was filled in a gap of aluminum fins. (3) Heatloss at the operation test of the heat-accumulating tank was 15 %. Recoverywas over 70 % even when the level of the heat recovering temperaturewas raised by 10 {sup 0}C.
