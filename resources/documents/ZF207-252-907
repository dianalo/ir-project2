(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Agencies Watch Progress of PTO's WORM SystemandM;Many agencies are keeping a close eye on the Patent and Trademark Office'sAutomated Patent System (APS), the pioneering effort to install writeonce/read-many (WORM) optical-disk systems on a large scale in thegovernment.andM;WORM technology may be what is needed to eliminate much of the paper thegovernment pushes, fulfilling the promise of information technology.andP;  But itis too early to say for sure whether WORM is the way to go.andP;  The PTO is oneof the few agencies using it to store large quantities of information onceheld on paper, and the PTO project has not been trouble-free.andM;The APS will automate processing and retrieval of all patent filings, whichconsist of both text and drawings.andP;  The PTO system will handle information inboth text and image forms.andM;&quot;The PTO has galvanized the WORM effort in the government,&quot; said Robert R.andO;Freese, president of Alphatronix Inc. of Research Triangle Park, N.C.andM;Many federal agencies will wait and see what happens with APS before they getinvolved with WORM technology, Freese said.andP;  One agency that is lookingclosely at the PTO's imaging system is the Energy Department, which processesvoluminous documents.andM;Other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, have &quot;taken thelead and not waited for the final results,&quot; he said.andM;When PTO officials set out to build their system, they found &quot;there isnothing like it [the APS] in the government or outside of it,&quot; said Gary R.andO;Robinson, a PTO information systems official.andP;  He said that meant &quot;there isnothing to compare it against and nothing to show that we are not doing itthe best way.&quot;andM;PTO has installed a production test bed for use by a group of patentexaminers, and a second group of examiners will begin using the system inlate 1989, said Thomas P. Giammo, assistant PTO commissioner for informationsystems.andM;In November 1990 the agency will complete all analyses of alternativetechnologies, and the APS imaging subsystem will be deployed beginning inOctober 1991, he said.andM;Storage and RetrievalandM;WORM technology will evolve into two main applications, Freese said.andP;  Oneapplication would be to use the 12-inch platters in a jukebox and create anenormous library of relatively non-volatile data that can be accessed fairlyquickly, he said.andM;The other application would be for a high-speed jukebox that can store largeamounts of data quickly, Freese said.andP;  For example, a satellite takingpictures of various parts of the world must dump the data very quickly whenit flies over the United States, he said.andM;The trend will be toward office-level optical-disk systems, with a jukebox ineach main office and subsystem storage out at the workstation, Freese said.andM;The technique of writing to the disk has been perfected, but speed can beincreased and higher densities can be achieved, said William Hooton, directorof the National Archives and Records Administration's Optical Digital ImageStorage System project.andP;  However, great strides can be made in improvingindividual components of an optical-disk system, he said.andM;For example, &quot;we will see more capable, faster, cheaper scanners,&quot; Hootonsaid.andP;  Prices will drop rapidly as competition increases, he said.andP;  Scannerprices will fall from more than $100,000 down to $25,000 in the future,Hooton said.andP;  The less-expensive scanners also will be able to processnon-standard documents, &quot;not just nice clean office-type documents,&quot; he said.andM;Erasable optical-disk technology is &quot;still too progressive&quot; for most agenciesand many will continue to use tape for large-scale storage, Freese said.andP;  Inthe future, a helical-scan tape jukebox with multiple-gigabyte capacitiescould be used by PTO or other agencies that have tremendous storagerequirements, he said.andM;One disadvantage of such a device would be its relatively long access timecompared with rapid-access optical storage, Freese said.andM;The time required to access data on optical jukeboxes storing 50, two-sided,12-inch platters is about 10 seconds, which is why the agency has leanedtoward the rapid-access optical-storage devices, Giammo said.andM;PTO's current rapid-access optical-storage systems provided by Falcon SystemsInc., Bethesda, Md., have capacities of 130M and four drives, Robinson said.andO;Each unit uses a 16-MHz Motorola 68020 CPU and has a throughput speed of800K/sec.andP;  The access time is, at most, a few seconds.andM;High-density jukeboxes can store 164 gigabytes of data.andP;  Most agencies findthe jukebox's 10-second access time sufficient to meet their existing needs,Freese said.andP;  &quot;But everyone always wants things to be faster,&quot; so in thefuture agencies may look to PTO to see what they have done with rapid-accesstechnology, he said.andM;&quot;If everyone is showing jukeboxes, users will appoint requirements at thatlevel,&quot; Giammo said.andP;  No off-the-shelf rapid-access device packages have beendeveloped yet, but the technology is &quot;good, reliable and cost-effective forlarge databases and rapid access of data,&quot; he said.andM;International StandardandM;The PTO and some foreign countries' patent offices have agreed to follow theinternational facsimile Group 4 digital image transfer standard for recordingdigital images, Giammo said.andP;  The compression algorithm could expand andbecome a government and industry standard, he said, adding that vendors andagencies may feel pressure to follow what PTO does.andM;Standards bodies need to issue 12-inch WORM optical-disk standards, butprogress has been slow, Hooton said.andP;  Agencies are looking to the AmericanNational Standards Institute for guidance, but 12-inch WORM standards &quot;arenot even on their agenda,&quot; he said.andM;Several agencies, including the National Institute of Standards andTechnology and the National Archives, could issue federal guidelines orregulations and set standards for storing documents whose value is permanent,Hooton said.andM;Only about 3 percent to 5 percent of an agency's documents are permanentlyvaluable ones that would be sent to the National Archives, Hooton said.andP;  &quot;Wedo not care what they do internally&quot; at this time, and only a smallpercentage of documents would have to be converted to an archivable medium,such as paper or certain kinds of magnetic tape, he said.andM;Until a clear standard emerges, Hooton said, it is impossible to directagencies to buy a certain technology.andM;If there are 10 manufacturers using 10 incompatible sets of media, &quot;we cannotsay only Sony [Corp.andP;  of America] media can be used,&quot; Hooton said.andP;  &quot;Wecannot pick one company and eliminate the rest, because we would be tied upin court for the next 50 years.&quot;andM;Agencies now installing or planning optical-disk systems will lose little ifa standard is established in the future, Hooton said.andP;  &quot;We have been sayingit is smart to upgrade every three to five years to newer kinds of media,&quot; hesaid.andM;&quot;It stands to reason that an agency would not lose any data and would loselittle money if it had to convert data to follow a standard or guidelines.&quot;andM;Until such regulations are issued, agencies are free to pick the optical-disksystem best suited to their needs, Hooton said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
