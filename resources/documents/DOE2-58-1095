The projectis sponsored by DG XVII of the European Community as a demonstrationproject. The innovation in this project is mainly the use of solar energyin the production of dried vegetables on an industrial scale and in animprovement of the drying techniques by introducing a multistage dryingprocess, which represents a fully controlled drying process. 3 differenttypes of solar collectors are used. The expected amount of energy savingsis about 7250 MWh/a, about 1/2 of this is due to the use of solar energythe rest is due to the heat recovery system and multistage drying. Theprimary energy demand will be reduced by 2/3's compared to a conventionalplant. The capital return period is calculated to be about 10 years,which is about half of the expected lifetime of 20 years of the completeinstallation.</TEXT></DOC>
