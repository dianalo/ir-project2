T. Coleman Andrews III, president and chief executive officer, declined to make a more specific forecast, but said pretax operating profit and net income were &quot;roughly the same&quot; because of benefits from tax-loss carry-forwards.    In the year-ago quarter, WorldCorp had operating profit of $108,000, but charges in connection with its withdrawal from scheduled-airline service produced the loss. When WorldCorp reports its results in the next few days, Mr. Andrews said, year-ago figures will be restated to reflect the withdrawal in 1987 from contract-maintenance and aircraft-leasing businesses.    WorldCorp has consolidated and reduced its long-term debt to $106 million from $119 million since the end of 1986. The consolidation was accomplished in August with an offering of $100 million of high-yield, 10-year notes.    Mr. Andrews said in an interview that full-year revenue would exceed $130 million, compared with $105.6 million last year. He declined to make an earnings forecast for the year. In 1986, the company had a loss of $28 million.    World Airways leases four 1980s-vintage DC-10s and eight 1960s-vintage 727s. Mr. Andrews said the 727s have about 10 more years of useful life and the DC-10s are expected to serve into the next century.    Last year, the U.S. Military Airlift Command accounted for about 40% of WorldCorp revenues. This year, Mr. Andrew said the percentage is &quot;a bit higher.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
