Stocks rose to another record in Hong Kong but were lower in Sydney and Singapore as well as Frankfurt and most other European markets.    Tokyo's Nikkei stock average, which rose 160.66 Tuesday, inched up 12.88 to 26010.88. The Tokyo Stock Exchange first section index fell 2.54 to 2136.61. Volume was 1.2 billion shares, unchanged from Tuesday.    Traders said shares floundered for most of the day before the Nikkei average edged into the plus column on late buying of large chemical company shares. The move was described as routine &quot;rotational trading&quot; by investors who switch from sector to sector during market advances in the absence of major market developments.    Kureha Chemical rose 40 to 1,380 yen ($9.43) a share. Sumitomo Chemical rose 9 to 945.    Some brokerage shares declined on profit-taking after recent gains. Yamaichi Securities dropped 120 to 2,250, Nomura Securities fell 100 to 4,450, and Nikko Securities slipped 30 to 2,270. Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone rose 40,000 to 2,850,000 yen a share.    Some export-led electrical and computer shares remained firm on the dollar's recent strength. Sony rose 90 to 5,590, and NEC was up 30 to 2,430. Among car manufacturers, Toyota Motor rose 40 to 2,200.    News reports that high-ranking Bank of Japan officials suggested the official discount rate might be raised came too late to affect trading yesterday.    London's Financial Times 30-share index rose 3.9 to 1853.7, but the 100-share index fell 2.3 to 2366. The gold mines index fell 3.8 to 453.1. Volume was 585.8 million shares, compared with 865 million Tuesday.    Dealers said the market was sluggish all day in thin trading in reaction to some large recent rights issues. Shares also were affected by Tuesday's fall on Wall Street and a mixed early trend in New York yesterday, dealers said.    Most leading issues were down or unchanged, but a few stocks showed gains on takeover speculation or earnings figures, dealers said.    Tesco rose 3 to 196 pence ($3.19) a share after reporting that pretax profit rose 39% in the 24 weeks ended Aug. 15.    U.S. investor buying boosted English China Clays 15 to 566 and Reed International 13 to 594, dealers said.    Dixons rose 9 to 385 after brokers Phillips andamp; Drew recommended the stock. The company's chairman also reported at the annual meeting that group retail sales are rising.    Hammerson Property continued to rise on takeover speculation, gaining 13 to 723 despite a statement that it had received no takeover offers.    Storehouse fell 3 to 404 as a rumored Mountleigh Group bid for the British retailer failed to materialize.    Shares in Frankfurt closed mostly lower in dull, trendless trading.    An uncertain mood in the foreign exchange markets and Tuesday's loss on Wall Street caused equities to give up most of their gains from Tuesday's rally, brokers said.    A bout of buying late in the session, spearheaded by mutual funds preparing for their end-of-quarter reports, lifted the market out of its lows and led some stocks to post narrow gains.    Continental Gummi-Werke, which set a price of 320 marks ($173.91) a share for the first part of its capital increase, gained 5.20 to 333.20. Some analysts forecast the stock will return to its record high of 374.    Hoechst, apparently little affected by rumors that Kuwait has sold its 25% stake in the chemical group in anticipation of a capital increase, slipped 0.60 to 320.80. BASF edged down 0.40 to 338.80.    Losses were heaviest in the automobile and electrical sectors. Porsche tumbled 33 to 965, giving up most of its Monday and Tuesday gains. Daimler-Benz fell 6 to 1,066, and Volkswagen slipped 3.50 to 379.50. Among electricals, Siemens dropped 4 to 659.50, and AEG-Telefunken declined 3.20 to 326.30.    Machinery makers Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz and Linde each eased 2.50, to 184 and 741, respectively. M.A.N. inched up 0.20 to 192. Deutsche Bank dropped 4.20 to 689.50, but Dresdner Bank held steady at 360.    Retailer Karstadt shed 7.50 to 589.50 after gaining 12.50 a day earlier.    Australian share prices continued to decline as the gold price fell in New York Tuesday and the Australian dollar eased. Sydney's All Ordinaries index, which has declined in every session but one since its record close Sept. 21, fell 15.2 to 2247.6.    Emperor Mines fell 0.10 to 9.60 Australian dollars ($6.90) a share. Elsewhere in the mining area, CRA dropped 0.30 to 10.60, Peko-Wallsend slipped 0.18 to 9.50, and Renison Gold Fields Consolidated was down 0.70 at 16.10.    In Hong Kong, bullish local traders drew foreign institutional investors back into the market, and the rush of fresh cash sent shares soaring in heavy trading. The Hang Seng index jumped 84.16 to 3943.64, its seventh record close in eight sessions. Property shares led the advance among blue-chip issues, but other sectors also made strong gains.    Singapore stocks drifted lower in thin trading. One broker described the day as a technical correction after several days of rises on similarly thin volume.    Shares ended higher in Stockholm and Milan, mixed in Amsterdam and lower in Paris, Brussels and Zurich. Widespread investor concern about rising interest rates depressed Paris shares, while fears of renewed domestic political instability deterred investors in Brussels.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                      % This                                 Sep 28     Sep 25     Year    U.S. ........................301.1      298.3    + 32.1    Britain .................... 709.8      702.8    + 42.6    Canada ..................... 438.2      438.4    + 31.5    Japan ..................... 1270.3     1216.7    + 34.4    France ..................... 425.1      427.5    +  4.1    Germany .................... 241.0      241.2    -  7.3    Hong Kong ................. 2744.2     2718.8    + 54.3    Switzerland ................ 213.0      211.7    +  6.1    Australia .................. 426.9      428.1    + 61.7    World index ................ 490.5      481.5    + 37.5</TEXT></DOC>
