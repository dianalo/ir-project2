Solar energy has substantially the characteristics of showingregular daily and annual changes. Wind energy has the characteristicsthat its blowing-in direction is unstable and its strength varies ina short time, but its speed increases in such places with less obstructionsas ravine. Accordingly a study of utilizing wind energy at a water reservoirwhich is used as wind dam invites hopeful expectations. Tide energy hasthe characteristics of slow, but regular fluctuations and its utilizationis now being experimented. The amount of renewable energy which may bealternate is 5-10 percent of the consumption. (86 figs, 112 tabs, 9 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
