DEC's support of DAL in itsLanWORKS Macintosh-to-VAX connectivity suite will help boost DAL,and Microsoft Corp plans to support Apple's language exclusively.andO;Other third-party vendors support DAL as one of a variety ofconnection methods.andP;  Proprietary systems such as Sybase offerbetter performance than DAL because they use direct links ratherthan language translation.andP;  DAL cannot be completely compatiblewith proprietary languages because it has to be a common set ofcommands across all SQL databases.andP;  Apple is aware of theselimitations and is working on Unix and DOS support; proprietaryconnectivity languages are better choices for knowledgeable usersat present.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Apple Computer Inc. (Standards).andO;Ticker:    AAPL.andO;Product:   Data Access Language (Search software) (Standards).andO;Topic:     TrendsData Base ServersQuery LanguagesData Base Management SystemsStandardsStructured Query Language.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Emily KayandM;In an effort to close ranks with the corporate database world, in 1988 Appletemporarily overcame its Not Invented Here mentality, and purchasedConnectivity Language/1 (CL/1) and its developer, Network Innovations Corp.andO;Since then Apple has pushed CL/1 as the standard link between Macintoshapplications and SQL databases housed on mainframes and minicomputers.andP;  Alongwith a name change to Data Access Language (DAL), Apple even announced plansto incorporate the client side of the software into the Mac operating system.andM;DAL enables programs to span the considerable divide between the Macintoshand SQL databases.andP;  Through DAL, Mac applications can send queries to andreceive results from host databases without requiring users to learn SQL andwithout requiring developers to learn mainframe database software; it's ageneral interface to the universe of SQL.andM;But is it a standard?andP;  DAL eventually may become a standard in the SQL world,but it's not there yet.andP;  Even if it achieves widespread acceptance, it willbe just one of many choices for Mac users.andM;Digital Equipment Corp.'s support for DAL in LanWORKS, its suite ofMac-to-VAX connectivity programs, will help Apple boost DAL as a standard,said Scott Hickey, vice president of product development at FairfieldSoftware Inc., one of the first Macintosh developers to write a commercialapplication using DAL.andP;  Eventual support for a DOS client also will boostDAL's standing, but DAL's support for Unix will be crucial, he said.andM;&quot;When [a DAL server for Unix] ships, you'll see a number of Unix platformscoming out with DAL support, including Sun, Data General, Wang, Apollo,Hewlett-Packard, Stratus and Prime,&quot; Hickey said.andP;  &quot;That's a whole universewhere we feel SQL will explode: with the small, powerful, cheap Unixservers.&quot;andM;Andyne Computing Ltd. used DAL in developing Graphical Query Language, a toolthat presents a pictorial view of the host database, complete with relationallinks, and lets users build their own queries.andP;  Doug Ross, vice president ofAndyne, agreed that one SQL standard for the Mac won't win out.andP;  &quot;In a worldof multiple standards, yes, DAL will be a standard.andP;  But exclusively, no.&quot;andM;More than one way to SQL.andP;  Several third-party developers, includingFairfield and Andyne, already support DAL in software packages that eliminatethe need for users to write their own SQL queries.andP;  But these packagessupport other connection methods as well.andP;  Redmond, Wash.-based MicrosoftCorp., on the other hand, announced that Excel, its best-selling spreadsheetapplication, will support only Apple's database connectivity language.andM;&quot;DAL has been well-received by our customers, and we're working closely withApple to promote that,&quot; said Sam Hobson, product manager for Microsoft Excelfor the Mac.andP;  &quot;We have no plans to support proprietary methods.andP;  Users areable, with DAL, to address most major database vendors, and we support Applein getting DAL established as a standard.&quot;andM;Other Mac vendors also are helping to push DAL.andM;&quot;The advantage to us is the sheer fact that DAL will be in such widespreaduse,&quot; said Julie Lyon, product manager for Double Helix, a relationaldatabase program from Odesta Corp. of Northbrook, Ill.andP;  &quot;It's critical to thefuture of desktop computing that people be able to work on the front end,using products like Double Helix, in their own environments and shareinformation with other systems.andP;  DAL and SQL will be so widespread, it'scritical to sup-port them.&quot;andM;Database vendor Ingres Corp. of Alameda, Calif., will distribute and supportthe DAL server for VAX/VMS, said Bob Friedman, the company's manager ofdesktop products.andP;  Ingres also is working with TechGnosis Inc., whoseSequeLink, a suite of external commands (XCMDs) and application programminginterfaces, supports Ingres and many other host systems.andM;&quot;Ingres' position is that Apple has set the standard for Mac-to-hostconnectivity with DAL, and we're getting behind that standard and supportingit because it gives users maximum flexibility and choices,&quot; Friedman said.andM;Party line on DAL.andP;  DAL's primary plus is that it lets users link their Macsto a variety of SQL databases on the host, not just one, said DavidWunderlich, a software engineer with Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. ofPortsmouth, N.H.andM;&quot;[DAL] is important so you don't tie yourself into one database-managementsystem, which for us now is Sybase, but that could change tomorrow,&quot;Wunderlich said.andP;  &quot;If it were to change, we don't want to worry about havingto rewrite our Mac systems.&quot;andM;Apple's recent announcement delaying System 7.0's release gives systemvendors significant lead time to develop and improve their proprietary Macconnections.andM;Sybase and other proprietary systems' major advantage is performance,Wunderlich noted.andP;  &quot;With a direct link, you don't have to worry aboutprocessing time of the translation,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;When you have 100 or 300users against one CL/1 or SequeLink server, it takes a lot of time.&quot;andM;A direct connection is faster because there's no translation and not muchoverhead, agreed Fairfield's Hickey.andP;  While overhead is insignificant in asingle large query, it can be quite substantial during multiple transactions.andM;DAL differs from other methods in the total level of connectivity as well,according to Todd Carper, director of connectivity solutions at Cupertino,Calif.-based ACIUS Inc., whose Mac-based 4th Dimension database will supportall available SQL transport systems.andM;&quot;DAL has to be a common set of commands across all the SQL databases, whichmeans it doesn't call Sybase's store procedures,&quot; Carper said.andP;  &quot;So there maybe certain commands not supported because they're not common.andP;  If you have aSybase server running and you want full integration and sophisticatedconnections, go with the direct-connect products because they're fast,support all the capabilities, are tuned for that type of server and arebetter client/server products.&quot;andM;Room to grow.andP;  Apple itself recognizes DAL's limitations.andP;  Lance Hoffman, DALproduct manager with Apple, acknowledged that the company has a way to gobefore DAL can become a serious standard, with Unix and DOS versions beingthe outstanding issues.andP;  Apple is working on Unix but has yet to decide howto approach DOS, he said.andM;&quot;DAL is only on VAX and IBM (mainframe) platforms now,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Sybase andOracle are on other platforms we have no solutions for today.andP;  If users needaccess to data on platforms we don't support, there are better alternatives.&quot;andM;For now, proprietary mechanisms are best for users who know exactly whatdatabases they want and how to connect them to their Macintoshes.andM;&quot;Since Sybase is the only database we're accessing, DAL doesn't buy usanything,&quot; said Joe Herrin, manager of PC development with CSX TechnologiesInc. of Jacksonville, Fla.andP;  &quot;If we had multiple databases, we would look atDAL.&quot;andM;Many users still are evaluating SQL itself and don't know what the futureholds.andP;  Rohm and Haas Co. of Philadelphia is looking into the need for SQLservers and DAL in particular, said Tony Patalocchi, information strategistwith the chemical manufacturer.andP;  &quot;We have a pretty diverse platform base allthe way up and down our product line, and there's no one single answer forevery question,&quot; Patalocchi said.andM;Users just beginning the SQL trip would be wise to implement DAL, ACIUS'Carper said.andP;  &quot;If users are not sure about what product to use or has manydifferent products, DAL is the perfect solution,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;As they goalong, they may need high-level, sophisticated connection to the server andwill likely move up to a direct product and won't lose any work.andP;  If youdon't know what to do, start with DAL and move up.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
