A key opposition leader, meanwhile, was quoted Sunday as callingfor talks with the military government on the nation's politicalfuture.   In a surprise television appearance from his country home atBucalemu, Gen. Pinochet said Sunday, ``I acknowledge theopposition's victory, but I am not going to change what theconstitution says. March 11, 1990, is going to be the day that thegovernment is handed over.   ``The situation is very simple,'' he said. ``We fulfilled theconstitution that was set up ... so now that the opposition hastriumphed, why should we change?''   The comments of the 72-year-old commander-in-chief of Chile'sarmed forces came during a three-minute TV newscast. Pinochet wasdressed in a short-sleeve blue shirt. He appeared relaxed and spokeclearly and firmly.   Nearly 7 million Chileans went to the polls Wednesday to vote onthe armed forces' proposal that Pinochet remain president until1997. Pinochet, who ousted elected Marxist President SalvadorAllende in a 1973 coup that left Allende dead, lost by about800,000 votes or a margin of more than 11 percent.   The vote was carried out under a 1980 constitution. Thatdocument also calls for elections for president and congress to beheld in December 1989, with the winners taking office in March.   Opposition leaders have pressed Pinochet's military governmentto move up the date of elections and make other constitutionalchanges.   Their proposals include eliminating a constitutional ban onMarxist groups, and allowing the entire Senate _ not justtwo-thirds _ to be elected rather than appointed.   Opposition leaders also want to streamline the process by whichfuture constitutional changes can be made.   ``We will formally call on those holding power now to talk toreach an agreement,'' opposition spokesman Patricio Aylwin said inan interview published Sunday in the newspaper La Epoca. ``We willtake the initiative by making a proposal and call to the armedforces.''   Aylwin is spokesman for the 16-party coalition that urgedChileans to vote ``no'' in the referendum.   A 4-man military junta acts as the legislature of this SouthAmerica country, which has been ruled by freely elected, democraticgovernments for most of its 178-year history as an independentnation.   The junta is empowered to change the constitution, but Pinochetsaid in a speech broadcast nationwide the night after thereferendum that he had no intention of doing so.   Ricardo Lagos, a prominent, moderate Socialist, acknowleged thatnegotiations, if they take place, would take time. ``The people aremature enough to understand that 15 years of dictatorship don't endin 15 hours.''   But other Pinochet opponents already have served notice theydon't intend to wait long or peacefully. On Saturday, a coalitionof leftist parties publicly called for Pinochet's immediateresignation.   The situation sets up potential clashes between the governmentand its opponents. In the two days following the election, tens ofthousands of Chileans celebrated Pinochet's defeat with spontaneousdemonstrations in the streets of the capital and other major cities.   On Friday, an estimated 350,000 Chileans gathered in a downtownpark in a rally organized by the opposition.   Hundreds of youths have clashed with riot police since thereferendum, leading to two shooting deaths, as well as dozens ofinjuries and arrests.   About 20 reporters and photographers suffered minor injurieslast week when they were attacked by riot police as they coveredopposition celebrations.   On Sunday, two national policemen guarding the U.S. Consulatefired on two unidentified gunmen who shot at them from a parkedcar, the state Orbe news agency said. No injuries were reported.</TEXT></DOC>
